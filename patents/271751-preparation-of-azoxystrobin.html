				<td>PREPARATION OF AZOXYSTROBIN<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing the strobilurin fungicide methyl (E)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate(azoxystrobin).<br>
Methods for preparing azoxystrobin are described in WO 92/08703. In one method, azoxystrobin is prepared by reacting 2-cyanophenol with methyl (E)-2-[2-(6-chloro-pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxyacrylate. A high-yielding method for producing asymmetrical 4,6-bis(aryloxy)pyrimidirie derivatives is disclosed in WO 01/72719 in which a 6-chloro-4-aryloxypyrimidine is reacted with a phenol, optionally in the presence of a solvent and/or a base, with the addition of from 2 to 40 mol % of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). In addition, it has previously been found by the present inventors that even lower concentrations of DABCO (for example, between 0.1 and 2 mol%) are also able to catalyse this reaction.<br>
The present invention is,based on the discovery that, when preparing azoxystrobin or an acetal precursor of azoxystrobin using DABCO as a catalyst, the order of addition of the reaction components has an effect on the yield and reaction rate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group C(CO2CH3)=CHOCH3 or the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group C(CO2CH3)CH(OCH3)2, or a mixture of the two groups, which comprises either (a) reacting a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein W has the meaning given above, with 2-cyanophenol, or a salt thereof in the presence of between 0.1 and 40 mol % of DABCO, or (b) reacting the compound of formula (III):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with a compound of formula (IV):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a salt thereof, where W has the meaning given above, in the presence of between 0.1 and 40 mol % of DABCO and wherein DABCO is not mixed with the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) unless (i) 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) or a salt of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) is present; or (ii) DABCO is present as an acid salt or (iii) conditions are such that DABCO and the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) are not able to react with each other; with the proviso that when between 0.1 and 2 mol% DABCO is used, the DABCO is not added last.<br>
Convemently, the process of the invention is carried out by mixing one of the components of the reaction, preferably in the presence of a solvent or diluent with the other component, if appropriate in the presence of a solvent or diluent. An acid acceptor is added at a convenient point, as discussed below, and the mixture is stirred, normally at an elevated temperature. After the reaction is judged to be complete, the reaction mixture is worked up and the product is isolated using conventional techniques well known to a skilled chemist. According to prior art methods, the DABCO catalyst may be added at any time to the reaction mixture including (i) as the first reactant, (ii) to the first component alone or (iii)<br><br>
after me second component has been added. However, it has now been found that, in order to promote higher product yields and a faster reaction rate, DABCO should not be allowed to react with the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) in the absence of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV), or a salt of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV). While not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that, in the absence of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV), DABCO and the compounds of formula (II) or (III) react and then the reaction product can further convert to give a non-active species, thus reducing yield and available catalyst. It is also believed that the reaction between the neutral DABCO molecule and the compounds of formula (II) or (III) is inhibited in the presence of acid species. Therefore, if an acid salt of DABCO is added to the reaction flask or generated in situ (by the addition of neutral DABCO to a mixture containing an acid) and, provided that the acid acceptor is not present or not sufficiently soluble in the reaction mixture to quickly deprotonate the DABCO acid salt, the reaction between DABCO and the compounds of formula (n) or (IE) is inhibited. It is also believed that, in the presence of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV), the phenol can act as an acid source either protonating the DABCO salt directly or, after reaction between the phenol and the compounds of formula (II) or (in), may act as a base and be protonated by the mole of hydrochloric acid produced. Finally, in the presence of a salt of 2-cyanophenol or a salt of the compound of formula (IV), the reaction product of DABCO and the compounds of formula (II) or (III) reacts with the salt of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) to give the expected product of formula (I) and, concomitantly, regenerates the catalyst.<br>
Thus, in particular, the process of the present invention may be carried out by, for example,<br>
any one of the following methods:<br>
i)      adding 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) to the compound of formula<br>
(II) or the compound of formula (III), and then adding DABCO; ii)     adding 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) to DABCO and then adding<br>
the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III); iii)    adding DABCO to 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) and then adding<br>
the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III); iv)    adding the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) to 2-<br>
cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) and then adding DABCO;<br><br>
v)     providing a mix of the compound of fonnula (II) or the compound of formula (III) with 2-cyanophenol or the compound of fonnula (IV) and then adding DABCO;<br>
vi)    providing a mix of DABCO with 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) and then adding the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III);<br>
vii)   adding a mix of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) and the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) to DABCO; or<br>
viii) adding a mix of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) and DABCO to the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III);<br>
ix)    adding DABCO to an acidic, solution of the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) in which sufficient acid is present to convert all of the DABCO to a salt, and then adding 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) provided that the acid acceptor is either not added before the 2-cyanophenol or the reaction between the DABCO salt and the acid acceptor is slow; or<br>
x)     mixing an acid salt of DABCO, either as a solid or a preformed salt by the reaction of acid and DABCO, to the compound of formula (II) or the compound of formula (ID) and then adding 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) provided that the base is either not added before the 2-cyanophenol or the reaction between the DABCO salt and the acid acceptor is slow.<br>
Suitable acid salts of DABCO include, but are not limited to DABCOH^Cl", DABCOH+ (HS04)", (DABCOH+)2SO42- and DABCOH+SO3Me)-.<br>
Of course, if DABCO is not able to react with the compound of formula (II) or the compound or formula (III), for example, if both components are in a solid state or if one component is insoluble (or perhaps only partially soluble) in the solvent/diluent used in the reaction, then they can be mixed with impunity. However, in such a case, before the conditions are made suitable for the reaction to take place, 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV), or a salt of 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) must be added.<br>
Further mixing options are thus allowed if the components of the reaction are first mixed in conditions under which they are not able to react. For example, a mix of the compound of<br><br>
Conveniently the process of the invention is carried out in a suitable inert solvent or diluent. These include, for example, aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum ether, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and decalin; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane and trichloroethane; heteroaromatic solvents such as pyridine or a substituted pyridine, for example, 2,6-dimethylpyridine; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropylether, methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-tert-arnyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane and anisole; ketones, such as acetone, butanone, methyl wobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- and i-butyronitrile and benzonitrile; amides, such as N-dimemylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylformamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone and hexamethylphosphoric triamide; tertiary amines, in particular, amines of the formula R1R2R3 where Rl, R2 and R3 are each independently C1-10 (especially C1-8) alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl, aryl (especially phenyl) or aryl(C1-4)alkyl (especially benzyl); or two or three of R1,R2 and R3 join together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form one, two or three 5-, 6- or 7-membered alicyclic rings optionally fused and optionally containing a second ring nitrogen atom, examples of suitable tertiary amines being N,N-di-isopropylethylamine (Hunig's base), N,Ndimethylaniline, triethylamine, t-butyldimethyl-amine, N,N-diisopropylmethylamine, N,N-diisopropylisobutylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-2-ethylbutylamine, tri-n-butylarnine, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, N,N-dicyclohexylethyl-amine, N-tert-butylcyclohexylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or 2-dimethylaminopyridine; esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and isopropyl acetate; sulphoxides, such as dimethylsulphoxide; sulphones, such as dimethylsulphone or sulpholane; and mixtures of such solvents and diluents and mixtures of one or more of them with water. In addition, if the starting compounds for the reaction or the product from the reaction are in the form of liquids or will be liquid at the reaction temperature, they may act as diluent/solvent for the process of the invention. In such a situation, additional diluent or solvent may not be required.<br>
Particularly suitable diluents are ketones [such as methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone], esters [such as isopropyl acetate], tertiary amines [such as [N,N-di-isopropylethylamine (Htinig's base)], aromatic hydrocarbons [such as toluene or xylene<br><br>
formula (II) or the compound of formula (III) with DABCO may be provided and the reaction not started until 2-cyanophenol or the compound of formula (IV) is added.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the process of invention comprises reacting a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein W has the meaning given above, with 2-cyanophenol, or a salt thereof (suitably potassium 2-cyanophenoxide) in the presence of between 0.1 and 40 mol % of DABCO.<br>
When the process of the invention is carried out using a compound of formula (II) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group or using a compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, the product obtained may include a proportion of the compound of formula (I) where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group. This may happen because it is possible that methanol is eliminated from the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group under the conditions of the process. For the same reason, if the process is carried out using a compound of formula (II) or a compound of formula (IV) where W is a mixture of the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group and the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group (and the invention includes such a process), the product obtained will be a compound of formula (I) where W is a mixture of the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group and the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group; however, the product may have a higher proportion of the compound of formula (I) where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group than expected from the proportion of (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group in the mixed starting material due to this potential elimination of methanol. This is of no real consequence because it will normally be required to convert the product of formula (I) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group to the compound of formula (I) where W is the group methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group by the elimination of methanol.<br><br>
 (mixed isomers or single isomer)] and amides [such as N,N--dimethylformanude]. In a particular aspect of the present invention, methyl isobutyl ketone is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, cyclohexanone is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, isopropyl acetate is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, N,N-dimethylformamide is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, toluene is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Hunig's base) is used as diluent. Most suitably, the diluent used in the present invention is N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the process is carried out in an aqueous organic solvent system. Suitably, in this embodiment, when the compound of formula (II) is reacted with 2-cyanophenol, the 2-cyanophenol is present as a salt. This salt may either have been added as is or be generated in situ from the neutral phenol and the acid acceptor (see below).  Suitably, the salt is a lithium, caesium, sodium, potassium, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene salt of 2-cyanophenol. More suitably, the salt is the l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, sodium or potassium salt of 2-cyanophenol. Even more suitably, the salt is the sodium or potassium salt of 2-cyanophenol. Most suitably, the salt is potassium 2-cyanophenoxide. Suitable co-solvents for use in such an aqueous process are solvents which are at least partially water immiscible solvents such as cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone and isopropyl acetate. Advantageously, the water is removed throughout the reaction when these partially water immiscible solvents are used. In addition, it has also been found that water miscible solvents may also be used in such an aqueous process. Suitable water miscible solvents are N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone and dimethyl sulphoxide. In one embodiment, the water is removed throughout the reaction when the water miscible solvents are used. Most suitably, when such aqueous systems are used, the salt of 2-cyanophenol is potassium 2-cyanophenoxide and the diluent is cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone, isopropyl acetate or N,N-dimemylfbrmamide. It is noted that when the 2-cyanophenol is added to the process as an aqueous solution of potassium 2-cyanophenoxide it is possible to reduce the quantity of acid acceptor (see below) used.<br><br>
In addition, the process of the invention is preferably carried out in the presence of at least 0.8 moles of an acid acceptor per mole of 2-cyanophenol or a compound of formula (IV). Suitable acid acceptors are all customary inorganic and organic bases. These include, for example, alkaline earth metal and alkali metal hydroxides, acetates, carbonates, bicarbonates, phosphates, hydrogen phosphates and hydrides [such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, calcium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride], guanidines, phosphazines (see, for example, Liebigs Ann. 1996,1055-1081), prophosphatranes (see, for example, JACS 1990, 9421-9422), metal dialkylamines [such as lithium di-iso-propylamide] and tertiary amines [such as those described above as possible solvents or diluents]. Particularly suitable acid acceptors are the alkaline earth metal and alkali metal carbonates, especially potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate and l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. More suitably, the acid acceptor is potassium carbonate. Most suitably, the present invention is carried out in the presence of methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, isopropyl acetate, N,N-diisopropylemylamine (Hiinig's base) or N, N-dimemylformamide with potassium carbonate as the acid acceptor.<br>
The time at which the acid acceptor is added may be important in some embodiments of the invention. If the acid acceptor to be used is not added as an aqueous solution and will not generate large (one mole of water per mole of phenol deprotonated) amounts of water, such as l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, alkali metal phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, greater than mole of alkali metal or alkaline earth carbonate, then the acid acceptor can be added at any time in the process. Also, if the 2-cyanophenol is the first reaction component added, any acid acceptor can be added at any time and consideration of whether to remove any water generated by the 2-cyanophenol plus acid acceptor reaction can be made. Where a compound of formula (II) is charged first, aqueous solutions of acid acceptors should not be added before the 2-cyanophenol is added to the mixture. For a compound of formula (IV) added first, preferably in the presence of a diluent, it is advantageous to add the compound of formula (III) before adding the acid acceptor. For a compound of formula (III) added first, preferably in the presence of a diluent,<br><br>
the acid acceptor can be added at any suitable time. While not wanting to be bound by theory, strong bases in the presence of significant quantities of water can hydrolyse compounds of formula (II) resulting in by-product formation and lower yields - the presence of 2-cyanophenol or both components of the reaction will neutralise the strong bases and allow the desired reaction to occur. Obviously, in selecting the amount of acid acceptor to be added, consideration of effects of potential excesses of acid acceptors should be made and normally, when using aqueous solutions of acid acceptors, or acid acceptor which generate a mole of water per mole of phenol deprotonated such as alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or hydrogen carbonates, close to stoichiometric quantities of base should be used.<br>
The process of the invention is carried out in the presence of between 0.1 and 40 mol% of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). Suitably, it is carried out in the presence of between 0.2 and 40 mol% of DABCO. More suitably, it is carried out in the presence of between 0.5 and 10 mol %. Most suitably, it is carried out in the presence of between 0.5 and 5 mol% DABCO.<br>
IQ a particular embodiment of the invention the process is carried out in the presence of about 1 mol% DABCO with methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, isopropyl acetate, N,N-di-isopropylethylamine (Htinig's base), toluene, or N,N-dimethylformamide as diluent. More suitably, the diluent is N,N-dimethylformamide or isopropyl acetate. Most suitably, the diluent is N,N-dimethylformamide. Suitably, the acid acceptor will be potassium carbonate.<br>
When carrying out the process of the invention, the reaction temperature can be varied within a relatively wide range. The temperature chosen will depend on the nature of the solvent or diluent, for example on its boiling point and/or its effectiveness for promoting the desired reaction, and on the rate at which the reaction is to be carried out. In any given solventor diluent, the reaction will tend to progress more slowly at lower temperatures, hi general, the reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 120°C, suitably at a temperature of from 40 to 100°C, and typically at a temperature of from 45 to 95°C, for example, from 60 to 95°C.<br><br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at any reasonable pressure depending on the solvent, base and reaction temperature. For low boiling diluents or reagents, higher temperatures can be accessed at higher than atmospheric pressures, and reactions can be carried out at atmospheric pressures or under vacuum if desired. Suitably, the reaction may be carried out at a pressure of from 0.01 to 10 Bara, more suitably at a pressure of from 0.5 to 5 Bara and most suitable at a pressure of from 0.8 to 2 Bara, for example at ambient pressure.<br>
For carrying out the process of the invention, suitably from 0.4 to 4 mol, more suitably from 0.95 to 1.5 mol and most suitably from 1 to 1.2 mol, of 2-cyanophenol is employed per mol of a compound of formula (II); and similar amounts (0.4 to 4 mol, more suitably from 0.95 to 1.5 mol and most suitably from 1 to 1.2 mol) of a compound of formula (IV) are employed per mole of the compound of formula (ID).<br>
2-Cyanophenol is a commercially available material.<br>
The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group C(CO2CH3)=CHOCH3, and the compound of formula (II) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group C(CO2CH3)CH(OCH3)2, may be prepared as described in WO 92/08703 from the reaction of 3-(a-methoxy)methylenebenzofuran-2(3H)-one (derived from benzofuran-2(3H)-one) with 4,6-dichloropyrimidine. The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group, may also be prepared by eliminating methanol from (that is, by the demethanolysis of) the compound of formula (II) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, as described in WO 92/08703 or WO 98/07707. The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, may be prepared as described in GB-A-2291874 by reacting a compound of formula (IV), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, with 4,6-dichloropyrimidine. It may be purified before use by known techniques or may be used in an unpurified state from a previous reaction, for example, in a 'one-pot' reaction.<br>
The compound of formula (IV), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, may be prepared as described in GB-A-2291874 from 3-(a-methoxy)methylenebenzofuian-<br><br>
2(3H)-one. The compound of formula (IV), where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group, may be prepared by the procedure described in EP 0 242 081 or by the demethanolysis of the compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group. In this case, the phenolic group needs to be protected by, for example, benzylation before demethanolysis and then de-protected afterwards.<br>

Compare, for instance, example (a) with any of (b), (c) and (d); example (f) with (e); examples (h) and (k) with any of (g), (i) and (j); example (m) with (1); example (p) with (o); and example (r) with (q). In addition, the benefits of controlling the<br><br>
reaction conditions to physically prevent DABCO and the compouna or lormuia il reacting can also be seen. Compare, for example, (m) in which, although DABCO is added to the compound of formula II in the absence of 2-cyanophenol, it is only able to react slowly with the compound of formula II due to the low solubility of the system, with (n) in which the solubility has been increased: in the latter, a significant proportion of the starring material is unreacted after more than 16 hours.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments and examples thereof, the scope of the present invention is not limited only to those described embodiments. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, modifications and adaptations to the above-described invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is defined and circumscribed by the appended claims.
