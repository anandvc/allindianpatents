CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No.<br>
60/704,035, filed July 29, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
Technical Field<br>
[001] The present invention relates to polyphenol-like compounds that<br>
are useful for inhibiting VCAM-1 expression, MCP-1 expression and/or SMC<br>
proliferation in a mammal. The disclosed compounds are useful for regulating<br>
markers of inflammatory conditions, including vascular inflammation, and for<br>
treatment and prevention of inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[002] Atherosclerosis, restenosis and immune disorders, such as<br>
arthritis, are viewed as inflammatory conditions mediated in large part by an<br>
inflammatory cascade. For instance, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis or<br>
restenosis occurs in three phases; an inflammatory phase, a cellular proliferative<br>
phase, and a phase of remodeling involving extracellular matrix protein synthesis.<br>
The inflammatory phase is initiated by expression and exhibition of inflammatory<br>
molecules (such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, or E-selectin) on endothelial cells, resulting<br>
in the recruitment of monocytes from the bloodstream into the sub-endothelial<br>
space. When in the endothelium, monocytes transform into macrophages and<br>
become foam cells as they take up cholesterol. These cholesterol-loaded foam<br>
cells release cytokines such as monocyte-colony stimulating factor and monocyte<br>
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), instigating the cellular proliferative phase.<br>
Cytokine secretion results in localized monocyte and smooth muscle cell (SMC)<br>
proliferation and recruitment and production of extracellular matrix (the final<br>
phase). During this phase macrophages continue their uptake of cholesterol in<br>
the form of oxidized low-density lipoprotein resulting in swelling of the artery wall.<br>
Continuance of this inflammatory cascade eventually results in the formation of a<br>
plaque consisting of lipid-engorged macrophage-foam cells, smooth muscle cells,<br>
and extracellular matrix (Crowther M (2005) Hematology 1, 436).<br>
-1-<br><br>
[003] Expression of vascular adhesion moiecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the<br>
surface of endothelial cells for the adhesion and transmigration of monocytes is a<br>
fundamental early event in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions: such as<br>
autoimmune disorders, bacterial and viral infections, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
and autoimmune diabetes, in addition to atherosclerosis (Pilewski JM etal. (1995)<br>
Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 12,1; Ohkawara Y et al. (1995) Am J Respir Cell Mol<br>
Biol 12, 4; Rabb A et al. (1994) Am J Respir Care Med 11,149). Thus, drugs that<br>
inhibit VCAM-1 expression are desirable therapeutics for the treatment of these<br>
conditions.<br>
[004] Chemoattractant factors, such as MCP-1, have been shown to play<br>
a role in monocyte recruitment, proliferation, and migration in a number of<br>
inflammatory conditions and are correlated with a risk for restenosis (Welt FGP et<br>
al. (2002) Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 22,1769). As such, inhibition of MCP-1<br>
expression represents a desirable property of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.<br>
Finally, smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, resulting in tissue remodeling and<br>
decreased organ function is another characteristic of many inflammatory<br>
conditions including atherosclerosis, restenosis, chronic transplant rejection, and<br>
asthma. Therefore, inhibition of the hyperproliferation of SMC is another desirable<br>
property for therapeutic compounds.<br>
[005] To date the most effective means of preventing and treating<br>
atherosclerosis has been via cholesterol-dependant approaches. These include<br>
seeking to lower low-density lipoprotein or raise high density lipoprotein<br>
cholesterol. For example, one method provides compounds useful for regulating<br>
the expression of ApolipoproteinA-l (ApoA-l) (PCT/US2005/038048) a lipoprotein<br>
important for transporting cholesterol.<br>
[006] However, the identification of new inflammatory mediators in the<br>
early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis has led to a new focus on a<br>
variety of inflammatory or cholesterol~/ndepencfenf approaches; including the<br>
inhibition of VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression, or prevention of smooth muscle cell<br>
(SMC) proliferation. Increasing evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and basic<br>
mechanistic studies supports the importance of these inflammatory targets in the<br>
treatment and prevention of inflammatory conditions. Finding drugs that inhibit<br>
-2-<br><br>
VCAM-1 and/or MCP-1 expression, or inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation is<br>
desirable.<br>
[007] One class of such compounds thought to play a role in the<br>
prevention of inflammatory conditions are polyphenols. These are common<br>
constituents in of the human diet; they are present in many foods and beverages<br>
of plant origin. Numerous patents and applications describe uses, compositions,<br>
and methods for the prevention, treatment or mitigation of inflammatory and<br>
cardiovascular diseases by the administration of naturally occurring polyphenols<br>
to a patient in need of a pharmaceutical intervention (see, e.g., US/03033578,<br>
US/10696752 ,US 2004 0105817, US 6,900,241, US 6,649,193, US 2002 029088,<br>
US 2003 065505, PCT/09901997/IB, PCT/00000392/AU, PCT/00235153/US,<br>
PCT/US1996/04,028, US 2005 0171163 A1).<br>
[008] It is believed that polyphenols are effective, at least in part, as a<br>
result of their activity on the inhibition of VCAM-1, MCP-1, LDL oxidation, and<br>
smooth muscle cell proliferation (Takahahi R etal. (2005) J Agric Food Chem 53,<br>
1; Fuhrman B et al. (2005) J Nutr 135, 722; Cald UP ef al. (1996) Am J Clin Nutr<br>
63, 403; Tijburg LB et al. (1997) Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr 37, 771; Leiro J et al.<br>
(2004) Int Immunopharmacol 4, 991; Carluccio MA ef al. (2003) Arterioscler<br>
Thromb Vase 23, 622; Ouyang P ef al. (2004) Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao 24,<br>
975; Hofmann CS et al. (2003) FASEB J17, 702; Araim O et al. (2002) J Vase<br>
Surg 35,1226; El Bedout J et al. (2005) Cardiovasc Res 67, 317). The inverse<br>
relationship between dietary polyphenol consumption and incidence of<br>
cardiovascular diseases is likely associated with their ability to attenuate<br>
biomarkers of oxidative stress, lipidemia and inflammation. Consequently,<br>
naturally occurring polyphenols have the potential to be therapeutically employed.<br>
[009] However, the protective properties of naturally occurring<br>
polyphenols have been difficult to realize for several reasons, including poor<br>
bioavailability and deleterious effects at high concentrations. For instance, the<br>
most abundant and available source of resveratrol for consumers, red wine,<br>
cannot be consumed in therapeutically efficacious quantities on a daily basis<br>
because of the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol consumption.<br>
Furthermore, the use of naturally occurring polyphenols as potential therapies has<br>
also been impeded by an inability to achieve efficacious levels because of poor<br>
-3-<br><br>
bioavailability. Bioavailability of polyphenols in humans ranges from 1% to 26%<br>
with variability between individuals, and between different polyphenols. In<br>
addition to this, polyphenols differ in how they are absorbed, metabolized, and<br>
excreted. For example, polyphenol flavonoids, such as quercetin, have been<br>
reported to have less than 1% intestinal absorption following oral administration<br>
(Gugler et al. (1975) Eur J Clin Pharm 9, 223). Another complicating factor is the<br>
effect of metabolites of polyphenols. These have been shown to have a negative<br>
influence on the biological activity of the parent compounds. Such metabolites<br>
often differ from the parent compound in terms of toxicity, efficacy, and length of<br>
residence in the plasma. These and other limiting factors, such as poor water<br>
solubility limiting the route of administration, have made it difficult to determine<br>
appropriate dosages for use in humans.<br>
[010] Additionally, several human studies on foods or beverages<br>
containing polyphenols have failed to demonstrate any significant benefit on<br>
primary clinical endpoints, such as oxidative stress, lipidemia, and inflammation.<br>
Of twelve recent studies examining differing sources of polyphenols, six showed<br>
no effect on lipid parameters while the other six showed some improvement<br>
(Manach (2005) Curr Opin Lipidol 16, 77-84). Such contradictory data has limited<br>
the use of polyphenols, despite their many potentially beneficial properties.<br>
[011] Thus, there continues to be a need for novel compounds with<br>
properties like those of polyphenols for the prevention and treatment of<br>
inflammatory conditions. Embodiments of the present invention include<br>
compounds that inhibit VCAM-1 and/or MCP-1 expression and/or inhibit smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation. The compounds of the present invention also possess<br>
other properties, which enable their use in the treatment or prophylaxis of other<br>
diseases and conditions.<br>

[079] A particular class of salts can be classified as organic amine salts.<br>
The organic amines used to form these salts can be primary amines, secondary<br>
amines or tertiary amines, and the substituents on the amine can be straight,<br>
branched or cyclic groups, including ringed structures formed by attachment of<br>
two or more of the amine substituents. Of particular interest are organic amines<br>
that are substituted by one or more hydroxyalkyl groups, including alditol or<br>
carbohydrate moieties. These hydroxy substituted organic amines can be cyclic or<br>
acyclic, both classes of which can be primary amines, secondary amines or<br>
tertiary amines. A common class of cyclic hydroxy substituted amines is the amino<br>
sugars.<br>
[080] The compounds of the disclosure may contain one or more chiral<br>
centers and/or double bonds and, therefore, exist as stereoisomers, such as<br>
geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers. The term "stereoisomers"<br>
when used herein consist of all geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers.<br>
These compounds may be designated by the symbols "R" or "S," depending on<br>
the configuration of substituents around the stereogenic carbon atom. The<br>
present invention encompasses various stereoisomers of these compounds and<br>
mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers.<br>
Mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers may be designated "(±)" in<br>
nomenclature, but the skilled artisan will recognize that a structure may denote a<br>
chiral center implicitly.<br>
[081] It is appreciated that compounds of the present invention may have<br>
a chiral center and may exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic<br>
forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that<br>
the present invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active, diastereomeric,<br>
polymorphic, or stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which possess the useful properties described herein, it being well<br>
known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by resolution<br>
of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-<br>
active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation<br>
using a chiral stationary phase).<br>
-20-<br><br>
[082] Geometric isomers can also exist in the compounds of the present<br>
invention. The present invention encompasses the various geometric isomers<br>
and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond or arrangement of substituents around a carbocyciic<br>
ring. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are designated as being<br>
in the "Z' or "£" configuration wherein the terms "Z' and "E" are used in<br>
accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures<br>
depicting double bonds encompass both the E and Z isomers.<br>
[083] Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond alternatively can<br>
be referred to as "cis" or "trans," where "cis" represents substituents on the same<br>
side of the double bond and "trans" represents substituents on opposite sides of<br>
the double bond. The arrangement of substituents around a carbocyciic ring is<br>
designated as "cis" or "trans." The term "cis" represents substituents on the same<br>
side of the plane of the ring and the term "trans" represents substituents on<br>
opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the<br>
substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the<br>
ring are designated "cis/trans."<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Methods of Treatment<br>
[094] Embodiments of the present invention also provide pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising compounds disclosed herein formulated together with<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These formulations include<br>
those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal and parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous) administration, although the most suitable<br>
form of administration in any given case will depend on the degree and severity of<br>
the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular compound being<br>
used.<br>
[095] Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in<br>
discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the compound as powder or granules; as a solution or a<br>
suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-<br>
oil emulsion. As indicated, such formulations may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active<br>
compound and the carrier or excipient (which may constitute one or more<br>
accessory ingredients). The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and must not be<br>
deleterious to the recipient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and<br>
may be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a<br>
tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound.<br>
Other pharmacologically active substances may also be present including other<br>
compounds. The formulations of the invention may be prepared by any of the well<br>
known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the<br>
components.<br>
-34-<br><br>
[096] For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include,<br>
for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium saccharin, talc, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium<br>
carbonate, and the like. Liquid pharmacologically administrable compositions can,<br>
for example, be prepared by dissolving or dispersing, an active compound as<br>
described herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in an excipient, such as,<br>
for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to<br>
thereby form a solution or suspension. In general, suitable formulations may be<br>
prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid<br>
or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or<br>
granules of the compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.<br>
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the<br>
compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed<br>
with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s).<br>
Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered<br>
compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
[097] Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration<br>
include lozenges comprising a compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and<br>
acacia ortragacanth, and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such<br>
as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
[098] Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral<br>
administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the compounds, which<br>
are approximately isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These<br>
preparations are administered intravenously, although administration may also be<br>
effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such<br>
preparations may conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water<br>
and rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable<br>
compositions according to the invention may contain from 0.1 to 5% w/w of the<br>
active compound.<br>
[099] Formulations suitable for rectal administration are presented as<br>
unit-dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the compound with<br>
-35-<br><br>
one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then<br>
shaping the resulting mixture.<br>
[0100] Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin may take<br>
the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers<br>
and excipients which may be used include Vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene<br>
glycols, alcohols, and combinations of two or more thereof. The active compound<br>
is generally present at a concentration of from about 0.1% to about 15% w/w of<br>
the composition, for example, from about 0.5 to about 2%.<br>
[0101] The amount of active compound administered may be dependent<br>
on the subject being treated, the subject's weight, the manner of administration<br>
and the judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
[0102] In another embodiment, intermittent administration, such as on a<br>
monthly or yearly basis, of a dose of the encapsulated compound may be<br>
employed. Encapsulation facilitates access to the site of action and allows the<br>
administration of the active ingredients simultaneously, in theory producing a<br>
synergistic effect. In accordance with standard dosing regimens, physicians will<br>
readily determine optimum dosages and will be able to readily modify<br>
administration to achieve such dosages.<br>
[0103] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition<br>
disclosed herein can be measured by assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of<br>
the compound. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for<br>
determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the<br>
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between<br>
toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as<br>
the ratio LD50/ED5o. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are<br>
preferable.<br>
[0104] The therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from<br>
cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a<br>
circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the<br>
concentration of the therapeutic which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of<br>
symptoms) as determined in cell culture assays or animal models. Levels in<br>
plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid<br>
-36-<br><br>
chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a<br>
suitable bioassay. Examples of dosages are: about 0.1 x|C50, about 0.5xlC50,<br>
about 1 xlC5o, about 5x|C5o, 10x|C5o, about 50x|C5o, and about 100x|C5o.<br>
[0105] Data obtained from the cell culture assays or animal studies can be<br>
used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Therapeutically<br>
effective dosages achieved in one animal model may be converted for use in<br>
another animal, including humans, using conversion factors known in the art (e.g.,<br>
Freireich et al. (1966) Cancer Chemother Reports 50, 219-244) and Table 1 for<br>
Equivalent Surface Area Dosage Factors).<br>

[0106] The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of<br>
circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The<br>
dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed<br>
and the route of administration utilized. Generally, a therapeutically effective<br>
amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the<br>
severity of the medical condition in the subject. The dosage may be determined<br>
by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the<br>
treatment.<br>
[0107] In one embodiment, a compound as disclosed herein, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof, is administered in<br>
combination with another therapeutic agent. The other therapeutic agent can<br>
provide additive or synergistic value relative to the administration of a flavonoid<br>
compound alone. The therapeutic agent can be, for example, a statin, a PPAR<br>
-37-<br><br>
agonist (e.g., a thiazolidinedione orfibrate), a bile-acid-binding-resin, niacin, a<br>
RXR agonist, an anti-obesity drug, a hormone, a tyrophostine, a sulfonylurea-<br>
based drug, a biguanide, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, apolipoprotein E, a<br>
cardiovascular drug, an HDL-raising drug, an HDL enhancer, or a regulator of the<br>
apolipoprotein A-1V and/or apolipoprotein genes.<br>
[0108] One embodiment provides methods for treating, preventing or<br>
mitigating inflammatory conditions and related disease states, characterized by<br>
altered expression of markers of inflammation such as VCAM-1, MCP-1 and/or<br>
SMC proliferation, in a mammal. In one embodiment, the inflammatory conditions<br>
and related disease states are those where inhibition of VCAM-1, MCP-1 and/or<br>
SMC proliferation is desirable.<br>
[0109] Another embodiment provides methods for regulating markers of<br>
inflammation, including vascular inflammation, and their use in the treatment and<br>
prevention of inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases and related disease<br>
states in a mammal.<br>
[0110] In one embodiment, a method of treating, preventing or mitigating<br>
inflammatory conditions, such as cardiovascular or inflammatory disorders,<br>
comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a disclosed<br>
compound. The disclosed compound may be administered as a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable composition, comprising a disclosed compound and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, a compound of the<br>
present invention is administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or pharmaceutically acceptable formulation;<br>
optionally in a combination or alternation therapy with a therapeutic agent or at<br>
least one other compound of the present invention. In combination therapy,<br>
effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas<br>
during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each agent is administered<br>
serially.<br>
[0111] In another embodiment, a compound of the present invention is<br>
administered as a pharmaceutical formulation, or prodrug; optionally in a<br>
combination or alternation therapy with a therapeutic agent or at least one other<br>
compound of the present invention.<br>
-38-<br><br>
[0112] Embodiments of the present invention provide methods for treating,<br>
preventing or mitigating cardiovascular disorders mediated by VCAM-1, MCP-1,<br>
and/or SMC proliferation, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of the invention, or in another embodiment, a<br>
composition comprising a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
[0113] "Cardiovascular disease" refers to diseases of the heart and<br>
circulatory system. Cardiovascular diseases that the compounds of the present<br>
invention are useful for preventing or treating include metabolic syndrome,<br>
arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, angina, stroke, ischemia, endothelial dysfunction<br>
(in particular those affecting blood vessel elasticity), peripheral vascular disease,<br>
coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, obesity,<br>

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS<br>
[0135] The following examples demonstrate methods to synthesize<br>
compounds of the invention wherein each W is independently a nitrogen or<br>
carbon, and an R-group may be independently selected,from the aforementioned<br>
group of substituents. The chosen synthetic method may involve use of protecting<br>
groups, which can be selected from those known in the art (e.g., Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, By TW Greene &amp; PGM Wuts John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
New York, 1991, 2nd ed). Compounds synthesized in the manner described<br>
below may additionally be modified by functional group manipulations (e.g.,<br>
Organic Synthesis by MB Smith, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1994, Int. Ed. Chapter<br>
2), including reduction, oxidation, alkylation, and acylation.<br>

[0136] Flavonoid compounds may be represented by the general structure<br>
of Formula A.<br><br>
[0137] Ra may be selected from groups including alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, amide, amino, aryl, arylalkyl, carbamate, carboxy, cyano,<br>
cycloalkyl, ester, ether, formyl, halogen, haloalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl,<br>
hydrogen, hydroxyl, ketone, nitro, phosphate, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, sulfonic<br>
acid, sulfonamide and thioketone. Rbmay be selected from groups including alkyl,<br>

alkoxy, halogen, hydroxyl and hydrogen.<br>
[0138] One of ordinary skill will appreciate that flavonoid compounds as<br>
disclosed herein may be synthesized from readily available starting materials as<br>
outlined below.<br>
[0139] Formula B represents a general formula for flavonoid compounds<br>
comprising a phenyl-chromene:<br><br>
[0140] Flavonoids of Formula B can be synthesized by the procedure of<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
-44-<br><br><br>
[0141] Acid chloride 2 (Rd = CI) may be used directly in a reaction with<br>
acetophenone 1 to provide ester 3. The acid chloride may also be generated in<br>
situ by exposing the carboxylic acid 2 (Rd = OH) to a chlorinating agent such as<br>
POCI3. Ester 3 can be converted into diketone 4 via intramolecular<br>
rearrangement. Rearrangement may be achieved using a catalytic amount of<br>
base, such as potassium t-butoxide, KOH, NaH and the like. Cyclization of phenol<br>
4 to flavonoid 5 can be achieved by heating phenol 4 in the presence of a strong<br>
protic (HCI, AcOH, HI, AcOH, HBr, and mixtures thereof) or Lewis (BBr3) acid.<br>
[0142] Flavonoid compounds can be synthesized following the procedure<br>
of Scheme 2:<br>
-45-<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
[0143] Diketone 10 may be prepared by first exposing methyl ketones 6 or<br>
9 to basic conditions, such as potassium t-butoxide, KOH, NaH and the like, to<br>
form the corresponding enolate. Then, reaction with acyl halide 8 or 7 (X = Hal),<br>
respectively, affords diketone 10. Cyclization of diketone 10 to flavonoid 5 may<br>
likewise be accomplished by a number of methods. When Re= F, exposure of 10<br>
to heat and a polar solvent results in ring closure via nucleophilic aromatic<br>
substitution. Alternatively, strong protic or Lewis acids may be used when Re =<br>
alkoxy, SH, or NH2. Suitable acids include HCI, AcOH, HI, AcOH, HBr, BBr3, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>

[0146] Arylation of naphthalene analog 11 with boronic acid (or boronic<br>
ester) 12 occurs by a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling. Suitable Pd catalysts include<br>
Pd(Ph3)4 along with non-phosphine Pd catalysts, such palladium acetate. Other<br>
coupling procedures that may be used in the synthesis of flavonoid 13 include<br>
Stille coupling.<br>
[0147] Prodrugs of flavonoid compounds can be prepared according to<br>
Scheme 4:<br><br>
[0148] Prodrug esters 19 can be synthesized by treating phenol 16 with<br>
acid halide 17. Suitable acid halides include acid chlorides and bromides.<br>
Alternatively, esterification of phenol 16 with acid 18 in the presence of a<br>
carbodiimide, such as EDCI, affords ester 19.<br>

expression of VCAM-1, MCP-1, and/or SMC proliferation, or in the treatment of<br>
diseases in a host can be assessed using methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art, including those described below.<br>
Example 52 MCP-1 and VCAM-1 Assays<br>
[0223] Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted, and stored at<br>
-20°C. Cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded in 96-<br>
well plates in complete EGM-2 media (-100 uL/well); cells were plated at ~2-<br>

the following day cells are stimulated with TNF-a (~1 ng/mL) in the presence or<br>
-112-<br><br>
absence of compounds dissolved in DMSO. Triplicate wells were used for each<br>
test. To establish a dose curve and an IC50, multiple concentrations in 2- to 5-fold<br>
increments were used. Cells were exposed to TNF-a and compounds for<br>
approximately 16 hours. The next day, cells were visually examined via light<br>
microscopy to score for visual signs of toxicity. Cell culture media was analyzed<br>
using an MCP-1 ELISA. Cells were refed (-100 uL/well) with 20% CellTiter 96<br>
Aqueous One Cell Proliferation Solution (Promega), 80% EGM-2 medium. Media<br>
optical density (at 490 nm) was determined after 1 hour. Plates were aspirated<br>
and cell lysates were prepared and these lysates were tested using a VCAM-1<br>
ELISA.<br>
[0224] In Table 2, a positive result (+) was defined as at least 50%<br>
inhibition of the protein levels MCP-1 or VCAM-1, as determined by the ELISA.<br>
For comparison, resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, demonstrated 47%<br>
inhibition of MCP-1 and 54% inhibition of VCAM-1.<br>
Example 53 Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation Protocol<br>
[0225] Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted, and stored at<br>
-20°C. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) were plated in 96-<br>
well plates and were grown in SmBM-2 media. After 1-2 hours, media was<br>
aspirated and replaced with serum-free ME/F12 media, except the controls. Cells<br>
were incubated for a further 48 hours. Compounds were diluted in DME/F12<br>
containing 10% FBS. Media was aspirated from the plates and compounds in<br>
DME/F12 containing 10% FBS. Six wells were used per condition and duplicate<br>
plates were used. Cells were incubated for a further 72 hours. Media was<br>
aspirated from one set of plates; those cells were refed (-100 uL/well) with 20%<br>
CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Cell Proliferation Solution (Promega), 80% EGM-2<br>
medium. Media optical density (at 490 nm) was determined after 3-4 hours. In<br>
the second set of plates, serum-free DME/F12 media (20uL) was added to each<br>
well. Part of the supernatant (50uL) was removed and placed in an ELISA plate<br>
and was stored temporarily at 4°C. The remaining media and cells in the second<br>
set of plates were freeze-thawed for four cycles. The lysates and supematants<br>
were mixed and centrifuged. Part of the supernatant (50uL) was removed and<br>

placed in an ELISA plate. The Promega Cytotox assay was performed on the<br>
ELISA plates. The ratio of supernatant OD to supernatant+cell lysate OD was<br>
determined.<br>
[0226] In Table 2, a positive result (+) was defined as at least 40%<br>
