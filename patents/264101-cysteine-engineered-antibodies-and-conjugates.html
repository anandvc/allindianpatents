This non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR §1.53(b), claims the benefit under 35 USC<br>
§119(e) of US Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/612,468 filed on September 23, 2004 and US Provisional<br>
Application Ser. No. 60/696,353 filed on June 30, 2005, each of which are incorporated by reference in their<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to antibodies engineered with reactive cysteine residues and more<br>
specifically to antibodies with therapeutic or diagnostic applications. The cysteine engineered antibodies may<br>
be conjugated with chemotherapeutic drugs, toxins, affinity ligands such as biotin, and detection labels such as<br>
fluorophores. The invention also relates to methods of using antibodies and antibody-drug conjugate<br>
compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated<br>
pathological conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer,<br>
immunological and angiogenic disorders. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis<br>
and therapy with antibodies, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated<br>
polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of cancer cells as compared to normal, noncancerous<br>
cell(s). The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides, i.e. tumor<br>
associated antigens (TAA), has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via<br>
antibody-based therapies.<br>
The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of<br>
cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Lambert, J.<br>
(2005) Curr. Opinion in Pharmacology 5:543-549; Wu et al (2005) Nature Biotechnology 23(9): 1137-1146;<br>
Payne, G. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:207-212; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614;<br>
Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 26:151-172; US 4975278) theoretically allows<br>
targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic<br>
administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells<br>
as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05;<br>
Thorpe, (1985) "Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review," in Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy<br>
with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of<br>
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug-linking and drug-releasing properties (Lambert, J. (2005) Curr.<br>
Opinion in Pharmacology 5:543-549;. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been<br>
reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs<br>
used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al (1986)<br>
supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant<br>
toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) J. of the Nat. Cancer<br>
Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandleretal (2000) Bioorganic &amp; Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandleretal<br>
(2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer<br>
Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including<br>
tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less<br>
active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.<br>
An antibody-radioisotope conjugate has been approved. ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan,<br>
Biogen/Idec) is composed of a murine IgGl kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen<br>
found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and In or Y radioisotope bound by a<br>
thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood<br>
99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol.<br>
20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN® has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL),<br>
administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab<br>
ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to<br>
calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the<br>
Future (2000) 25(7):686; US Patent Nos. 4970198; 5079233; 5585089; 5606040; 5693762; 5739116;<br>
5767285; 5773001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of<br>
the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1 (Xie et al<br>
(2004) J. of Pharm. and Exp. Ther. 308(3): 1073-1082), is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of<br>
cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm.,<br>
BZL Biologies, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific<br>
membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under<br>
development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors.<br>
The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of<br>
dolastatin (WO 02/088172), have been conjugated to: (i) chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to<br>
Lewis Y on carcinomas); (ii) cACIO which is specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies (Klussman, et<br>
al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773; Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-<br>
784; Francisco et al (2003) Blood 102(4): 1458-1465; US 2004/0018194; (iii) anti-CD20 antibodies such as<br>
rituxan (WO 04/032828) for the treatment of CD20-expressing cancers and immune disorders; (iv) anti-<br>
EphB2R antibodies 2H9 and anti-IL-8 for treatment of colorectal cancer (Mao et al (2004) Cancer Research<br>
64(3):781-788); (v) E-selectin antibody (Bhaskar et al (2003) Cancer Res. 63:6387-6394); and (vi) other anti-<br>
CD30 antibodies (WO 03/043583). Variants of auristatin E are disclosed in US 5767237 and US 6124431.<br>
Monomethyl auristatin E conjugated to monoclonal antibodies are disclosed in Senter et al, Proceedings of the<br>
American Association for Cancer Research, Volume 45, Abstract Number 623, presented March 28,2004.<br>
Auristatin analogs MMAE and MMAF have been conjugated to various antibodies (WO 2005/081711).<br>
Conventional means of attaching, i.e. linking through covalent bonds, a drug moiety to an antibody<br>
generally leads to a heterogeneous mixture of molecules where the drug moieties are attached at a number of<br>
sites on the antibody. For example, cytotoxic drugs have typically been conjugated to antibodies through the<br>
often-numerous lysine residues of an antibody, generating a heterogeneous antibody-drug conjugate mixture.<br>
Depending on reaction conditions, the heterogeneous mixture typically contains a distribution of antibodies<br>
with from 0 to about 8, or more, attached drug moieties. In addition, within each subgroup of conjugates with<br>
a particular integer ratio of drug moieties to antibody, is a potentially heterogeneous mixture where the drug<br>
moiety is attached at various sites on the antibody. Analytical and preparative methods are inadequate to<br>
separate and characterize the antibody-drug conjugate species molecules within the heterogeneous mixture<br>
resulting from a conjugation reaction. Antibodies are large, complex and structurally diverse biomolecules,<br>
often with many reactive functional groups. Their reactivities with linker reagents and drug-linker<br>
intermediates are dependent on factors such as pH, concentration, salt concentration, and co-solvents.<br>
Furthermore, the multistep conjugation process may be nonreproducible due to difficulties in controlling the<br>
reaction conditions and characterizing reactants and intermediates.<br>
Cysteine thiols are reactive at neutral pH, unlike most amines which are protonated and less<br>
nucleophilic near pH 7. Since free thiol (RSH, sulfhydryl) groups are relatively reactive, proteins with<br>
cysteine residues often exist in their oxidized form as disulfide-linked oligomers or have internally bridged<br>
disulfide groups. Extracellular proteins generally do not have free thiols (Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive<br>
Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London, at page 55). The amount of free thiol in a protein<br>
may be estimated by the standard Ellman's assay. Immunoglobulin M is an example of a disulfide-linked<br>
pentamer, while immunoglobulin G is an example of a protein with internal disulfide bridges bonding the<br>
subunits together. In proteins such as this, reduction of the disulfide bonds with a reagent such as dithiothreitol<br>
(DTT) or selenol (Singh et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 304:147-156) is required to generate the reactive free<br>
thiol. This approach may result in loss of antibody tertiary structure and antigen binding specificity.<br>
Antibody cysteine thiol groups are generally more reactive, i.e. more nucleophilic, towards<br>
electrophilic conjugation reagents than antibody amine or hydroxyl groups. Cysteine residues have been<br>
introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachments to ligands or to form<br>
new intramolecular disulfide bonds (Better et al (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 13:9644-9650; Bernhard et al (1994)<br>
Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; Greenwood et al (1994) Therapeutic Immunology 1:247-255; Tu et al (1999)<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:4862-4867; Kanno et al (2000) J. of Biotechnology, 76:207-214; Chmura et al<br>
(2001) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 98(15):8480-8484; US 6248564). However, designing in cysteine thiol<br>
groups by the mutation of various amino acid residues of a protein to cysteine amino acids is potentially<br>
problematic, particularly in the case of unpaired (free Cys) residues or those which are relatively accessible for<br>
reaction or oxidation. In concentrated solutions of the protein, whether in the periplasm of E. coli, culture<br>
supernatants, or partially or completely purified protein, unpaired Cys residues on the surface of the protein<br>
can pair and oxidize to form intermolecular disulfides, and hence protein dimers or multimers. Disulfide<br>
dimer formation renders the new Cys unreactive for conjugation to a drug, ligand, or other label. Furthermore,<br>
if the protein oxidatively forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between the newly engineered Cys and an<br>
existing Cys residue, both Cys groups are unavailable for active site participation and interactions.<br>
Furthermore, the protein may be rendered inactive or non-specific, by misfolding or loss of tertiary structure<br>
(Zhang et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 311:1-9).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying structures and formulas. While the invention will be described in conjunction<br>
with the enumerated embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to<br>
those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and<br>
equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those<br>
described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no<br>
way limited to the methods and materials described.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as<br>
commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, and are consistent<br>
with: Singleton et al (1994) Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
New York, NY; and Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immunobiology, 5th Ed.,<br>
Garland Publishing, New York.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the<br>
following meanings:<br>
When trade names are used herein, applicants intend to independently include the trade name product<br>
formulation, the generic drug, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the trade name product.<br>
The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal<br>
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and<br>
antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) Jour, of<br>
Immunology 170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized;, chimeric, or derived from<br>
other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and<br>
binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immuno Biology, 5th<br>
Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called<br>
epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different<br>
epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An<br>
antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a fulllength<br>
immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that<br>
immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not<br>
limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease.<br>
The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g.,<br>
IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can<br>
be derived from any species. In one aspect, however, the immunoglobulin is of human, murine, or rabbit<br>
.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or<br>
variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2&gt; and Fv fragments;<br>
diabodies; linear antibodies; minibodies (Olafsen et al (2004) Protein Eng. Design &amp; Sel. 17(4):315-323),<br>
fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary<br>
determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to<br>
cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific<br>
antibodies formed from antibody fragments.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of<br>
substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical<br>
except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to<br>
polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants<br>
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to<br>
their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated<br>
by other antibodies. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from<br>
a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the<br>
antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the<br>
present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) Nature<br>
256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see for example: US 4816567; US 5807715). The<br>
monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in<br>
Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597; for example.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a portion of the<br>
heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived<br>
from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the<br>
chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another<br>
species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as<br>
they exhibit the desired biological activity (US 4816567; and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include "primatized" antibodies comprising<br>
variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, Ape<br>
etc) and human constant region sequences.<br>
An "intact antibody" herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain<br>
constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CHS. The constant domains may be<br>
native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence<br>
variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more "effector functions" which refer to those biological<br>
activities attributable to the Fc constant region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc<br>
region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include Clq binding; complement dependent<br>
cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and<br>
down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies<br>
can be assigned to different "classes." There are five major classes of intact immunoglobulin antibodies: IgA,<br>
IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgGl,<br>
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes<br>
of antibodies are called a, 8, e, y, and u,, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional<br>
configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Ig forms include hinge-modifications<br>
or hingeless forms (Roux et al (1998) J. Immunol. 161:4083-4090; Lund et al (2000) Eur. J. Biochem.<br>
267:7246-7256; US 2005/0048572; US 2004/0229310).<br>
An "ErbB receptor" is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB receptor family<br>
whose members are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor<br>
family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbBl, HER1),<br>
HER2 (ErbB2 or p!85neu), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). A panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies has<br>
been characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK.BR3 (Hudziak et al (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol.<br>
9(3): 1165-1172. Maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular<br>
proliferation by 56%. Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this<br>
assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the<br>
cytotoxic effects of TNF-a (US 5677171). The anti-ErbB2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further<br>
characterized in Fendly et al (1990) Cancer Research 50:1550-1558; Kotts et al. (1990) In Vitro 26(3):59A;<br>

and Schaefer et al. (1997) Oncogene 15:1385-1394.<br>
The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an ErbB ligand;<br>
a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal<br>
signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may<br>
be a "native sequence" ErbB receptor or an "amino acid sequence variant" thereof. Preferably, the ErbB<br>
receptor is native sequence human ErbB receptor. Accordingly, a "member of the ErbB receptor family" is<br>
EGFR (ErbBl), ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4 or any other ErbB receptor currently known or to be identified in the<br>
future.<br>
The terms "ErbBl", "epidermal growth factor receptor", "EGFR" and "HER1" are used<br>
interchangeably herein and refer to EGFR as disclosed, for example, in Carpenter et al (1987) Ann. Rev.<br>
Biochem., 56:881-914, including naturally occurring mutant forms thereof (e.g., a deletion mutant EGFR as in<br>
Humphrey et al (1990) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 87:4207-4211). The term erbBl refers to the gene<br>
encoding the EGFR protein product. Antibodies against HER1 are described, for example, in Murthy et al<br>
(1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 252:549-560 and in WO 95/25167.<br>
The term "ERRP", "EGF-Receptor Related Protein", "EGFR Related Protein" and "epidermal growth<br>
factor receptor related protein" are used interchangeably herein and refer to ERRP as disclosed, for example in<br>
US 6399743 and US Publication No. 2003/0096373.<br>
The expressions "ErbB2" and "HER2" are used interchangeably herein and refer to human HER2<br>
protein described, for example, in Semba et al (1985) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 82:6497-6501 and<br>
Yamamoto et al (1986) Nature, 319:230-234 (Genebank accession number X03363). The term "erbB2" refers<br>
to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and "neu" refers to the gene encoding rat plSSneu. Preferred ErbB2 is<br>
native sequence human ErbB2.<br>
"ErbB3" and "HER3" refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5183884 and 5480968 as well as Kraus et al (1989) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 86:9193-9197. Antibodies<br>
against ErbB3 are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5183884, 5480968 and<br>
in WO 97/35885.<br>
The terms "ErbB4" and "HER4" herein refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed, for example, in<br>
EP Pat Application No 599,274; Plowman et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:1746-1750; and<br>
Plowman et al (1993) Nature 366:473-475, including isoforms thereof, e.g., as disclosed in WO 99/19488.<br>
Antibodies against HER4 are described, for example, in WO 02/18444.<br>
Antibodies to ErbB receptors are available commercially from a number of sources, including, for<br>
example, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., California, USA.<br>
The term "amino acid sequence variant" refers to polypeptides having amino acid sequences that<br>
differ to some extent from a native sequence polypeptide. Ordinarily, amino acid sequence variants will<br>
possess at least about 70% sequence identity with at least one receptor binding domain of a native ErbB ligand<br>
or with at least one ligand binding domain of a native ErbB receptor, and preferably, they will be at least about<br>
80%, more preferably, at least about 90% homologous by sequence with such receptor or ligand binding<br>
domains. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions at certain<br>
positions within the amino acid sequence of the native amino acid sequence. Amino acids are designated by<br>
the conventional names, one-letter and three-letter codes.<br>
"Sequence identity" is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that<br>
are identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent<br>
sequence identity. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. One such<br>
computer program is "Align 2," authored by Genentech, Inc., which was filed with user documentation in the<br>
United States Copyright Office, Washington, DC 20559, on December 10, 1991.<br>
"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and "ADCC" refer to a cell-mediated reaction in<br>
which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils,<br>
and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.<br>
The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcyRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcyRI,<br>
FcyRII and FcyRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch<br>
and Kinet, (1991) "Annu. Rev. Immunol." 9:457-92. To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in<br>
vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in US 5500362 and US 5821337 may be performed. Useful effector<br>
cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a<br>
animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al (1998) PROC. NAT. ACAD. SCI. (USA) (USA) 95:652-<br>
"Human effector cells" are leukocytes which express one or more constant region receptors (FcRs)<br>
and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least FcyRIII and perform ADCC effector<br>
function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br>
(PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells<br>
being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g., from blood or PBMCs<br>
as described herein.<br>
The terms "Fc receptor" or "FcR" are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc constant region<br>
of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which<br>
binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and Fey RIII<br>
subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcyRII receptors<br>
include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino<br>
acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains<br>
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor<br>
FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (See<br>
review M. in Daeron, "Annu. Rev. Immunol." 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet,<br>
"Annu. Rev. Immunol"., 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al (1994) Immunomethods 4:25-34; and de Haas et al<br>
(1995) J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41. Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are<br>
encompassed by the term "FcR" herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is<br>
responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al (1976) J. Immunol., 117:587 and Kim et<br>
al (1994) J. Immunol. 24:249).<br>
"Complement dependent cytotoxicity" or "CDC" refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in<br>
the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first<br>
component of the complement system (Clq) to a molecule (e.g., an antibody) complexed with a cognate<br>
antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al J.<br>
Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996), may be performed.<br>
"Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed<br>
of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy<br>
chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of<br>
different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide<br>
bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains.<br>
Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant<br>
domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain<br>
variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are<br>
believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.<br>
The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively<br>
in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its<br>
particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of<br>
antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the<br>
heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the<br>
framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs,<br>
largely adopting a p-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops<br>
connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the P-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain<br>
are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain,<br>
contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al (1991) Sequences of<br>
Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,<br>
MD). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various<br>
effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).<br>
The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody<br>
which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues<br>
from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g., residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3)<br>
in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable<br>
domain; Kabat et al supra) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g., residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52<br>
(L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the<br>
heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917). "Framework Region" or<br>
"FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein<br>
defined.<br>
Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab"<br>
fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its<br>
ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites<br>
and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.<br>
"Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigenbinding<br>
site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight,<br>
non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable<br>
domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six<br>
hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable<br>
domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to<br>
recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.<br>
The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain<br>
(CHI) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the<br>
carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge<br>
region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains<br>
bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab'<br>
fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are<br>
also known.<br>
The "light chains" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly<br>
distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (k), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.<br>
"Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody,<br>
wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further<br>
comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired<br>
structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pliickthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburgand Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). Anti-<br>
ErbB2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO 93/16185; US Patent Nos. 5571894; and 5587458.<br>
The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which<br>
fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a variable light domain (VL) in the same<br>
polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on<br>
the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create<br>
two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161;<br>
and Hollinger et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448.<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain<br>
minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization is a method to transfer the<br>
murine antigen binding information to a non-immunogenic human antibody acceptor, and has resulted in many<br>
therapeutically useful drugs. The method of humanization generally begins by transferring all six murine<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human antibody framework (Jones et al, (1986) Nature<br>
321:522-525). These CDR-grafted antibodies generally do not retain their original affinity for antigen binding,<br>
and in fact, affinity is often severely impaired. Besides the CDRs, select non-human antibody framework<br>
residues must also be incorporated to maintain proper CDR conformation (Chothia et al (1989) Nature<br>
342:877). The transfer of key mouse framework residues to the human acceptor in order to support the<br>
structural conformation of the grafted CDRs has been shown to restore antigen binding and affinity<br>
(Riechmann et al (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224,487-499; Foote and Winter, (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499;<br>
Presta et al (1993) J. Immunol. 151,2623-2632; Werther et al (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 157:4986-4995;<br>
and Presta et al (2001) Thromb. Haemost. 85:379-389). For the most part, humanized antibodies are human<br>
immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are<br>
replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat,<br>
rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances,<br>
framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human<br>
residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient<br>
antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In<br>
general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable<br>
domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human<br>
immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The<br>
humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
(Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see US 6407213; Jones et al (1986)<br>
Nature, 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta, (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol.,<br>
2:593-596.<br>
A "free cysteine amino acid" refers to a cysteine amino acid residue which has been engineered into a<br>
parent antibody, has a thiol functional group (-SH), and is not paired as an intramolecular or intermolecular<br>
disulfide bridge.<br>
The term "thiol reactivity value" is a quantitative characterization of the reactivity of free cysteine<br>
amino acids. The thiol reactivity value is the percentage of a free cysteine amino acid in a cysteine<br>
engineered antibody which reacts with a thiol-reactive reagent, and converted to a maximum value of 1. For<br>
example, a free cysteine amino acid on a cysteine engineered antibody which reacts in 100% yield with a<br>
thiol-reactive reagent, such as a biotin-maleimide reagent, to form a biotin-labelled antibody has a thiol<br>
reactivity value of 1.0. Another cysteine amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody<br>
which reacts in 80% yield with a thiol-reactive reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0.8. Another cysteine<br>
amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody which fails totally to react with a thiolreactive<br>
reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0. Determination of the thiol reactivity value of a particular<br>
cysteine may be conducted by ELISA assay, mass spectroscopy, liquid chromatography, autoradiography, or<br>
other quantitative analytical tests.<br>
A "parent antibody" is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence from which one or more<br>
amino acid residues are replaced by one or more cysteine residues. The parent antibody may comprise a<br>
native or wild type sequence. The parent antibody may have pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications<br>
(such as additions, deletions and/or substitutions) relative to other native, wild type, or modified forms of an<br>
antibody. A parent antibody may be directed against a target antigen of interest, e.g. a biologically important<br>
polypeptide. Antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated glycolipid<br>
antigens; see US 5091178) are also contemplated.<br>
Exemplary parent antibodies include antibodies having affinity and selectivity for cell surface and<br>
transmembrane receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA).<br>
Other exemplary parent antibodies include those selected from, and without limitation, anti-estrogen<br>
receptor antibody, anti-progesterone receptor antibody, anti-p53 antibody, anti-HER-2/neu antibody, anti-<br>
EGFR antibody, anti-cathepsin D antibody, anti-Bcl-2 antibody, anti-E-cadherin antibody, anti-CA125<br>
antibody, anti-CA15-3 antibody, anti-CA19-9 antibody, anti-c-erbB-2 antibody, anti-P-glycoprotein antibody,<br>

An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a<br>
component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials<br>
which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes,<br>
hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will<br>
be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most<br>
preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or<br>
internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under<br>
reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody<br>
includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural<br>
environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one<br>
purification step.<br>
An antibody "which binds" a molecular target or an antigen of interest, e.g., ErbB2 antigen, is one<br>
capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful in targeting a cell<br>
expressing the antigen. Where the antibody is one which binds ErbB2, it will usually preferentially bind<br>
ErbB2 as opposed to other ErbB receptors, and may be one which does not significantly cross-react with other<br>
proteins such as EGFR, ErbB3 or ErbB4. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to these<br>
non-ErbB2 proteins (e.g., cell surface binding to endogenous receptor) will be less than 10% as determined by<br>
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). Sometimes, the anti-<br>
ErbB2 antibody will not significantly cross-react with the rat neu protein, e.g., as described in Schecter et al.<br>
(1984) Nature 312:513 and Drebin et al (1984) Nature 312:545-548.<br>
Molecular targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins and their<br>
ligands, such as, but not limited to: (i) CD3, CD4, CDS, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD40, CD79a (CD79a),<br>
and CD79P (CD79b); (ii) members of the ErbB receptor family such as the EOF receptor, HER2, HER3 or<br>
HER4 receptor; (iii) cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, Macl, p!50,95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and<br>
Vv/33 integrin, including either alpha or beta subunits thereof (e.g. anti-CDl la, anti-CD18 or anti-CDl Ib<br>
antibodies); (iv) growth factors such as VEGF; IgE; blood group antigens; flk2/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB)<br>
receptor; mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C, BR3, c-met, tissue factor, 37 etc; and (v) cell surface and<br>
transmembrane tumor-associated antigens (TAA).<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the term "monoclonal antibody 4D5" refers to an antibody that has<br>
antigen binding residues of, or derived from, the murine 4D5 antibody (ATCC CRL 10463). For example, the<br>
monoclonal antibody 4D5 may be murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 or a variant thereof, such as a humanized<br>
4D5. Exemplary humanized 4D5 antibodies include huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3,<br>
huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab, HERCEPTIN®)<br>
as in US Patent No. 5821337.<br>
The terms "treat" or "treatment" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative<br>
measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or<br>
disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired<br>
clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease,<br>
stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or<br>
palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable.<br>
"Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.<br>
Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have<br>
the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease<br>
or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce<br>
the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer<br>
cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis;<br>
inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated<br>
with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be<br>
cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time<br>
to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR).<br>
The term "bioavailability" refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given<br>
amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of<br>
both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered<br>
dosage form.<br>
The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that<br>
is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A "tumor" comprises one or more cancerous cells.<br>
Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or<br>
lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g.,<br>
epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small- cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer<br>
("NSCLC"), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum,<br>
hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer,<br>
glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon<br>
cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or<br>
renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile<br>
carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.<br>
An "ErbB-expressing cancer" is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell<br>
surface. An "ErbB2-expressing cancer" is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of<br>
19<br>
cells thereof, such that an anti-ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to<br>
the cancer.<br>
A cancer which "overexpresses" an antigenic receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of<br>
the receptor, such as ErbB2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue<br>
type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation.<br>
Receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels<br>
of the receptor protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC).<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of receptor-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g., via<br>
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO 98/45479), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction<br>
(PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR).<br>
The tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (HER2) are rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding<br>
to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell, and can been determined biochemically: 0 = 0-<br>
10,000 copies/cell, 1+ = at least about 200,000 copies/cell, 2+ = at least about 500,000 copies/cell, 3+ = about<br>
1-2 x 10 copies/cell. Overexpression of HER2 at the 3+ level, which leads to ligand-independent activation<br>
of the tyrosine kinase (Hudziak et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7159-7163), occurs in<br>
approximately 30% of breast cancers, and in these patients, relapse-free survival and overall survival are<br>
diminished (Slamon et al (1989) Science, 244:707-712; Slamon et al (1987) Science, 235:177-182).<br>
The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function<br>
of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At,<br>
131. 125, 90V 186D 188D 153C 212n. 32D 600 , .. .. . . „. . , ., I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, P, C, and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents,<br>
and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal<br>
origin, including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.<br>
An "autoimmune disease" herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an<br>
individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom.<br>
In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, a number of clinical and laboratory markers may<br>
exist, including, but not limited to, hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies, antigen-antibody<br>
complex deposits in tissues, benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments, and lymphoid cell<br>
aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B-cell mediated<br>
autoimmune disease, it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases<br>
through a multitude of mechanistic pathways, including autoantibody production, immune complex formation,<br>
dendritic and T-cell activation, cytokine synthesis, direct chemokine release, and providing a nidus for ectopic<br>
neo-lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of<br>
autoimmune diseases. An autoimmune disease can be an organ-specific disease (i.e., the immune response is<br>
specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system, the skin,<br>
the cardiopulmonary system, the gastrointestinal and liver systems, the renal system, the thyroid, the ears, the<br>
neuromuscular system, the central nervous system, etc.) or a systemic disease which can affect multiple organ<br>
systems (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, etc.).<br>
The term "cytostatic" refers to the effect of limiting the function of cells, such as limiting cellular<br>
growth or proliferation of cells.<br>

5891996; and human antibodies that bind EGFR, such as ABX-EGF (see WO 98/50433, Abgenix). The anti-<br>
EGFR antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent, thus generating an immunoconjugate (see, e.g., EP<br>
659.439A2, Merck Patent GmbH). Examples of small molecules that bind to EGFR include ZD1839 or<br>
Gefitinib (IRESSA™; Astra Zeneca), Erlotinib HC1 (CP-358774, TARCEVA™; Genentech/OSI) and<br>

An "anti-angiogenic agent" refers to a compound which blocks, or interferes with to some degree, the<br>
development of blood vessels. The anti-angiogenic factor may, for instance, be a small molecule or antibody<br>
that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. The preferred<br>
anti-angiogenic factor herein is an antibody that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).<br>
The term "cytokine" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population which act on<br>
another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and<br>
traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth<br>
hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine;<br>
insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),<br>
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth<br>
factor; prolactin; placental lactogen; tumor necrosis factor-a and -P; mullerian-inhibiting substance; mouse<br>
gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor; integrin; thrombopoietin<br>
(TPO); nerve growth factors such as NGF-P; platelet-growth factor; transforming growth factors (TGFs) such<br>
as TGF-a and TGF-P; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II; erythropoietin (EPO); osteoinductive factors;<br>

1, IL-la, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12; a tumor necrosis factor such as<br>
TNF-a or TNF-P; and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL). As used herein, the term<br>
cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active<br>
equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a<br>
pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is<br>
capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See,<br>
e.g., Wilman, "Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy" Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382,615th<br>
Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al "Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,"<br>
23<br>
Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985). The prodrugs of this<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs,<br>
sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated<br>
prodrugs, pMactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or<br>
optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine<br>
prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that<br>
can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those<br>
chemotherapeutic agents described above.<br>
A "liposome" is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant<br>
which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as the anti-ErbB2 antibodies disclosed herein and, optionally, a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer<br>
formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.<br>
The term "package insert" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial<br>
packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage,<br>
administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.<br>
"Phage display" is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to a<br>
coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. One utility of phage display lies in the<br>
fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences<br>
that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been<br>
used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage<br>
display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins, typically through<br>
fusions to either pill or pVIII of filamentous phage (Wells and Lowman, (1992) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.,<br>
3:355-362, and references cited therein). In monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to<br>
a phage coat protein or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type protein.<br>
Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand<br>
affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, Methods: A<br>
companion to Methods in Enzymology, 3:205-0216 (1991). Phage display includes techniques for producing<br>
antibody-like molecules (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immunobiology, 5th Ed.,<br>
Garland Publishing, New York, p627-628; Lee et al).<br>
A "phagemid" is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., ColEl, and a copy of<br>
an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including<br>
filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable<br>
marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids.<br>
When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles,<br>
the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of<br>
the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage<br>
particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to<br>
a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the<br>
surface of the phage particle.<br>
"Linker", "Linker Unit", or "link" means a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond or a chain of<br>
atoms that covalently attaches an antibody to a drug moiety. In various embodiments, a linker is specified as<br>
L. Linkers include a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as:<br>
-(CR2)nO(CR2)n-, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino<br>
(e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine™); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide,<br>
diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide.<br>
The term "label" means any moiety which can be covalently attached to an antibody and that<br>
functions to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal<br>
provided by the first or second label, e.g. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize<br>
interactions or increase affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic<br>
mobility, or cell-permeability, by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a<br>
capture moiety, to modulate ligand affinity, antibody/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.<br>
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-<br>
Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen,<br>
S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic<br>
compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized<br>
light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the<br>
absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are<br>
employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning<br>
that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical<br>
structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific<br>
stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an<br>
enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which<br>
may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The<br>
terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of<br>
optical activity.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
organic or inorganic salts of an ADC. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate,<br>
oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate,<br>
salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate,<br>
gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate,<br>
ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate.p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., l,l'-methylene-bis -(2-hydroxy-3-<br>
naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as<br>
an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety<br>
that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have<br>
more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counterion.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate" refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and<br>
an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include, but are not limited to,<br>
water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.<br>

CYSTEINE ENGINEERED ANTIBODIES<br>
The compounds of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino<br>
acids of a wild-type or parent antibody are replaced with a cysteine amino acid. Any form of antibody may be<br>
so engineered, i.e. mutated. For example, a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a<br>
cysteine engineered Fab, referred to herein as "ThioFab." Similarly, a parent monoclonal antibody may be<br>
engineered to form a "ThioMab." It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered<br>
cysteine residue in a ThioFab, while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a<br>
ThioMab, due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. Mutants with replaced ("engineered") cysteine (Cys)<br>
residues are evaluated for the reactivity of the newly introduced, engineered cysteine thiol groups. The thiol<br>
reactivity value is a relative, numerical term in the range of 0 to 1.0 and can be measured for any cysteine<br>
engineered antibody. Thiol reactivity values of cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are in the<br>
ranges of 0.6 to 1.0; 0.7 to 1.0; or 0.8 to 1.0.<br>
The design, selection, and preparation methods of the invention enable cysteine engineered antibodies<br>
which are reactive with electrophilic functionality. These methods further enable antibody conjugate<br>
compounds such as antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds with drug molecules at designated, designed,<br>
selective sites. Reactive cysteine residues on an antibody surface allow specifically conjugating a drug moiety<br>
through a thiol reactive group such as maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol<br>
functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino<br>
acid functionality in a protein, such as amino group of lysine residues or the N-terminal amino group. Thiol<br>
26<br>
specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups, but higher pH (&gt;9.0)<br>
and longer reaction times are required (Carman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach,<br>
Academic Press, London).<br>
Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention preferably retain the antigen binding capability of<br>
their wild type, parent antibody counterparts. Thus, cysteine engineered antibodies are capable of binding,<br>
preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens (TAA),<br>
cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, transmembrane proteins, signalling proteins,<br>
cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known<br>
or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines,<br>
molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated<br>
with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen<br>
may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein). An antigen to which a cysteine engineered antibody<br>
is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above-mentioned categories, wherein the<br>
other subset(s) of said category comprise other molecules/antigens that have a distinct characteristic (with<br>
respect to the antigen of interest).<br>
The parent antibody may also be a humanized antibody selected from huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2,<br>
huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (Trastuzumab,<br>
HERCEPTIN®) as described in Table 3 of US 5821337, expressly incorporated herein by reference;<br>
humanized 520C9 (WO 93/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies as described herein.<br>
Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site-specifically and efficiently coupled with<br>
a thiol-reactive reagent. The thiol-reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent, a capture, i.e.<br>
affinity, label reagent (e.g. a biotin-linker reagent), a detection label (e.g. a fluorophore reagent), a solid phase<br>
immobilization reagent (e.g. SEPHAROSE™, polystyrene, or glass), or a drug-linker intermediate. One<br>
example of a thiol-reactive reagent is N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). In an exemplary embodiment, reaction of a<br>
ThioFab with a biotin-linker reagent provides a biotinylated ThioFab by which the presence and reactivity of<br>
the engineered cysteine residue may be detected and measured. Reaction of a ThioFab with a multifunctional<br>
linker reagent provides a ThioFab with a functionalized linker which may be further reacted with a drug<br>
moiety reagent or other label. Reaction of a ThioFab with a drug-linker intermediate provides a ThioFab drug<br>
conjugate.<br>
The exemplary methods described here may be applied generally to the identification and production<br>
of antibodies, and more generally, to other proteins through application of the design and screening steps<br>
described herein.<br>
Such an approach may be applied to the conjugation of other thiol-reactive agents in which the<br>
reactive group is, for example, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, a pyridyl disulfide, or other thiol-reactive<br>
conjugation partner (Haugland, 2003, Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research<br>
Chemicals, Molecular Probes, Inc.; Brinkley, 1992, Bioconjugate Chem. 3:2; Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive<br>
Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London; Means (1990) Bioconjugate Chem. 1:2;<br>
Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 40-55, 643-671). The<br>
partner may be a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a toxin such as doxorubicin or pertussis toxin), a fluorophore such as a<br>
fluorescent dye like fluorescein or rhodamine, a chelating agent for an imaging or radiotherapeutic metal, a<br>
27<br>
peptidyl or non-peptidyl label or detection tag, or a clearance-modifying agent such as various isomers of<br>
polyethylene glycol, a peptide that binds to a third component, or another carbohydrate or lipophilic agent.<br>
The sites identified on the exemplary antibody fragment, hu4D5Fabv8, herein are primarily in the<br>
constant domain of an antibody which is well conserved across all species of antibodies. These sites should be<br>
broadly applicable to other antibodies, without further need of structural design or knowledge of specific<br>
antibody structures, and without interference in the antigen binding properties inherent to the variable domains<br>
of the antibody.<br>
Cysteine engineered antibodies which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not<br>
limited to, antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such antibodies<br>
may be used as naked antibodies (unconjugated to a drug or label moiety) or as Formula I antibody-drug<br>
conjugates (ADC). Tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can prepared for use in generating<br>
antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective<br>
cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or<br>
otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more<br>
particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non-cancerous cell(s). Often, such<br>
tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared<br>
to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen<br>
polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based<br>
therapies.<br>
Examples of TAA include, but are not limited to, TAA (l)-(36) listed below. For convenience,<br>
information relating to these antigens, all of which are known in the art, is listed below and includes names,<br>
alternative names, Genbank accession numbers and primary reference(s), following nucleic acid and protein<br>
sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Nucleic<br>
acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA (l)-(36) are available in public databases such as GenBank.<br>
Tumor-associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms<br>
possessing at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% sequence identity relative to the sequences identified<br>
in the cited references, or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a<br>
TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example, a TAA having a variant sequence<br>
generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding<br>
sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>

MUTAGENESIS<br>
DNA encoding an amino acid sequence variant of the starting polypeptide is prepared by a variety of<br>
methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, preparation by site-directed (or<br>
oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared<br>
DNA encoding the polypeptide. Variants of recombinant antibodies may be constructed also by<br>
restriction fragment manipulation or by overlap extension PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutagenic<br>
primers encode the cysteine codon replacement(s). Standard mutagenesis techniques can be employed to<br>
generate DNA encoding such mutant cysteine engineered antibodies. General guidance can be found in<br>
Sambrook et al Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, N.Y., 1989; and Ausubel et al Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and<br>
Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., 1993.<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis is one method for preparing substitution variants, i.e. mutant proteins.<br>
This technique is well known in the art (see for example, Carter (1985) et al Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-<br>
4443; Ho et al (1989) Gene (Amst.) 77:51-59; and Kunkel et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488).<br>
Briefly, in carrying out site-directed mutagenesis of DNA, the starting DNA is altered by first hybridizing an<br>
oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single strand of such starting DNA. After hybridization, a<br>
DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second strand, using the hybridized oligonucleotide as a<br>
primer, and using the single strand of the starting DNA as a template. Thus, the oligonucleotide encoding the<br>
desired mutation is incorporated in the resulting double-stranded DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis may be<br>
carried out within the gene expressing the protein to be mutagenized in an expression plasmid and the<br>
resulting plasmid may be sequenced to confirm the introduction of the desired cysteine replacement<br>
mutations (Liu et al (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20252-20260). Site-directed of protocols and formats,<br>
including those commercially available, e.g. QuikChange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene,<br>
La Jolla, CA).<br>
PCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making amino acid sequence variants of the starting<br>
polypeptide. See Higuchi, (1990) in PCR Protocols, pp.177-183, Academic Press; Ito et al (1991) Gene<br>
102:67-70; Bernhard et al (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; and Vallette et al (1989) Nuc. Acids Res.<br>
17:723-733. Briefly, when small amounts of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers<br>
that differ slightly in sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate<br>
relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template sequence only at the<br>
positions where the primers differ from the template.<br>
Another method for preparing variants, cassette mutagenesis, is based on the technique described by<br>
Wells et al (1985) Gene 34:315-323. The starting material is the plasmid (or other vector) comprising the<br>
starting polypeptide DNA to be mutated. The codon(s) in the starting DNA to be mutated are identified.<br>
There must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutation site(s). If no such<br>
restriction sites exist, they may be generated using the above described oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis<br>
method to introduce them at appropriate locations in the starting polypeptide DNA. The plasmid DNA is cut<br>
at these sites to linearize it. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between<br>
the restriction sites but containing the desired mutation(s) is synthesized using standard procedures, wherein<br>
the two strands of the oligonucleotide are synthesized separately and then hybridized together using standard<br>
techniques. This double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to<br>
have 5' and 3' ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly<br>
ligated to the plasmid. This plasmid now contains the mutated DNA sequence. Mutant DNA containing the<br>
encoded cysteine replacements can be confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
Single mutations are also generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis using double stranded<br>
plasmid DNA as template by PCR based mutagenesis (Sambrook and Russel, (2001) Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition; Zoller et al (1983) Methods Enzymol. 100:468-500; Zoller, M.J. and Smith,<br>
M. (1982) Nucl. Acids Res. 10:6487-6500).<br>

In the present invention, hu4D5Fabv8 displayed on M13 phage (Gerstner et al (2002) "Sequence<br>
Plasticity In The Antigen-Binding Site Of A Therapeutic Anti-HER2 Antibody", J Mol Biol. 321:851-62) was<br>
used for experiments as a model system. Cysteine mutations were introduced in hu4D5Fabv8-phage,<br>
hu4D5Fabv8, and ABP-hu4D5Fabv8 constructs. The hu4D5-ThioFab-Phage preps were carried out using the<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method as described earlier (Lowman, Henry B. (1998) Methods in<br>
Molecular Biology (Totowa, New Jersey) 87 (Combinatorial Peptide Library Protocols) 249-264).<br>
Oligonucleotides are prepared by the phosphoramidite synthesis method (US 4415732; US 4458066;<br>
Beaucage, S. and Iyer, R. (1992) "Advances in the synthesis of oligonucleotides by the phosphoramidite<br>
approach", Tetrahedron 48:2223-2311). The phosphoramidite method entails cyclical addition of nucleotide<br>
monomer units with a reactive 3' phosphoramidite moiety to an oligonucleotide chain growing on a solidsupport<br>
comprised of controlled-pore glass or highly crosslinked polystyrene, and most commonly in the 3' to<br>
5' direction in which the 3' terminus nucleoside is attached to the solid-support at the beginning of synthesis<br>
(US 5047524; US 5262530). The method is usually practiced using automated, commercially available<br>
synthesizers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Oligonucleotides can be chemically labelled with nonisotopic<br>
moieties for detection, capture, stabilization, or other purposes (Andrus, A. "Chemical methods for 5'<br>
non-isotopic labelling of PCR probes and primers" (1995) in PCR 2: A Practical Approach, Oxford University<br>
Press, Oxford, pp. 39-54; Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp.<br>
40-55,643-671; Keller, G. and Manak, M. in DMA Probes Second Edition (1993), Stockton Press, New York,<br>
PHESELECTOR ASSAY<br>
The PHESELECTOR (Phage ELISA for Selection of Reactive Thiols) assay allows for detection of<br>
reactive cysteine groups in antibodies in an ELISA phage format. The process of coating the protein (e.g.<br>
antibody) of interest on well surfaces, followed incubation with phage particles and then HRP labeled<br>
secondary antibody with absorbance detection is detailed in Example 2. Mutant proteins displayed on phage<br>
may be screened in a rapid, robust, and high-throughput manner. Libraries of cysteine engineered antibodies<br>
can be produced and subjected to binding selection using the same approach to identify appropriately reactive<br>
sites of free Cys incorporation from random protein-phage libraries of antibodies or other proteins. This<br>
technique includes reacting cysteine mutant proteins displayed on phage with an affinity reagent or reporter<br>
group which is also thiol-reactive. Figure 8 illustrates the PHESELECTOR Assay by a schematic<br>
representation depicting the binding of Fab or ThioFab to HER2 (top) and biotinylated ThioFab to streptavidin<br>
(bottom).<br>
PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION<br>
DNA encoding the cysteine engineered antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using<br>
conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to<br>
genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a source of<br>
such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into<br>
host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or other mammalian<br>
host cells, such as myeloma cells (US 5807715; US 2005/0048572; US 2004/0229310) that do not otherwise<br>
produce the antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.<br>
The yields of hu4D5Fabv8 cysteine engineered antibodies were similar to wild type hu4D5Fabv8. Review<br>

Opinion in Immunol. 5:256-262 and Pluckthun (1992) Immunol. Revs. 130:151-188.<br>
After design and selection, cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g. ThioFabs, with highly reactive<br>
unpaired Cys residues, may be produced by: (i) expression in a bacterial, e.g. E. coll, system or a mammalian<br>
cell culture system (WO 01/00245), e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO); and (ii) purification using<br>
common protein purification techniques (Lowman et al (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266(17):10982-10988).<br>
ThioFabs were expressed upon induction in 34B8, a non-suppressor E. coli strain (Baca et al (1997)<br>
Journal Biological Chemistry 272(16):10678-84). See Example 3a. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended<br>
in PBS (phosphate buffered saline), total cell lysis was performed by passing through a microfluidizer and the<br>
ThioFabs were purified by affinity chromatography with protein G SEPHAROSE™ (Amersham). ThioFabs<br>
were conjugated with biotin-PEO-maleimide as described above and the biotinylated-ThioFabs were further<br>
purified by Superdex-200™ (Amersham) gel filtration chromatography, which eliminated the free biotin-PEOmaleimide<br>
and the oligomeric fraction of ThioFabs.<br>
MASS SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS<br>
Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) analysis was<br>
employed for the accurate molecular weight determination of biotin conjugated Fab (Cole, R.B. Electro Spray<br>
Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Fundamentals, Instrumentation And Applications. (1997) Wiley, New York).<br>
The amino acid sequence of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A121C) peptide was determined by tryptic digestion<br>
followed by LC-ESI-Tandem MS analysis (Table 4, Example 3b).<br>
The antibody Fab fragment hu4D5Fabv8 contains about 445 amino acid residues, including 10 Cys<br>
residues (five on the light and five on the heavy chain). The high-resolution structure of the humanized 4D5<br>
variable fragment (Fv4D5) has been established, see: Eigenbrot et al "X-Ray Structures Of The Antigen-<br>
Binding Domains From Three Variants Of Humanized Anti-Pi 85her2 Antibody 4D5 And Comparison With<br>
Molecular Modeling" (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995). All the Cys residues are present in the form of<br>
disulfide bonds, therefore these residues do not have any reactive thiol groups to conjugate with drugmaleimide<br>
(unless treated with a reducing agent). Hence, the newly engineered Cys residue, can remain<br>
unpaired, and able to react with, i.e. conjugate to, an electrophilic linker reagent or drug-linker intermediate,<br>
such as a drug-maleimide. Figure 1A shows a three-dimensional representation of the hu4D5Fabv8 antibody<br>
fragment derived by X-ray crystal coordinates. The structure positions of the engineered Cys residues of the<br>
heavy and light chains are numbered according to a sequential numbering system. This sequential numbering<br>
system is correlated to the Kabat numbering system (Kabat et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for the<br>
4d5v7fabH variant of trastuzumab according to Figure IB which shows the sequential numbering scheme (top<br>
row), starting at the N-terminus, differs from the Kabat numbering scheme (bottom row) by insertions noted<br>
by a,b,c. Using the Kabat numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or<br>
additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable<br>
domain. The cysteine engineered heavy chain variant sites are identified by the sequential numbering and<br>
Kabat numbering schemes in the following chart:<br>
4D5Fab Heavy chain variants<br>
M13 phagemid-Cys mutant Fabs (Figures 3A and 3B) can be rapidly screened compared to Fab<br>
proteins. Phagemid-ThioFab binding to antigen and to streptavidin can be tested by coating HER2 and<br>
streptavidin, respectively, onto ELISA plates followed by probing with anti-Fab-HRP (Horse radish<br>
peroxidase) as described in Example 2 and depicted in Figure 8. This method allowed simultaneous<br>
monitoring of the effect on the antigen binding and the reactivity of the thiol group by the engineered Cys<br>
residue/conjugated biotin molecule. Also, the method can be applied to screen the reactive thiol groups for<br>
any protein displayed on M13 phage. Conjugated or unconjugated phagemid-ThioFabs are purified by simple<br>
PEG precipitation.<br>
The antigen-binding fragment of humanized 4D5 (hu4D5Fab) is well expressed in E. Coli and has<br>
been displayed on bacteriophage (Garrard et al (1993) Gene 128:103-109). The antibody Fab fragment<br>
hu4D5Fabv8 was displayed on M13 phage as a model system in the ELISA based assay to probe thiol<br>
reactivity. Figure 8 is a graphical representation of the PHESELECTOR assay, depicting binding of a<br>
biotinylated ThioFab phage and an anti-phage HRP antibody to HER2 (top) and Streptavidin (bottom). Five<br>
amino acid residues (L-Ala43, H-Ala40, H-Serll9, H-Alal21 and H-Serl22) were initially selected from<br>
crystal structure information as remote from the antigen binding surface (Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol.<br>
229:969-995). The Protein Database X-ray crystal structure was designated as 1FVC. Cys residues were<br>
engineered at these positions by site directed mutagenesis. ThioFab-phage preparations were isolated and<br>
reacted with the biotinylation reagent.<br>
Biotin conjugated and unconjugated variants were tested for HER2 and streptavidin binding using an<br>
ELISA based PHESELECTOR assay (Figure 8, Example 2) with an HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated<br>
anti-phage antibody. The interaction of non-biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (Figure 2A) and biotinylated<br>
phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (Figure 2B) with BSA (open box), HER2 (grey box) or streptavidin (solid box) were<br>
monitored through anti-Mi3-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody by developing a standard HRP reaction<br>
and measuring absorbance at 450 nm. The absorbance produced by turnover of a colorimetric substrate was<br>
measured at 450 nm. The reactivity of ThioFab with HER2 measures antigen binding. The reactivity of<br>
ThioFab with streptavidin measures the extent of biotinylation. The reactivity of ThioFab with BSA is a<br>
negative control for nonspecific interaction. As seen in Figure 2A, all the ThioFab-phage variants have<br>
similar binding to HER2 compared to that of wild type hu4D5Fabv8-phage. Furthermore, conjugation with<br>
biotin did not interfere in the ThioFab binding to HER2 (Figure 2B).<br>
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the ThioFabs-phage samples showed varying levels of streptavidin<br>
binding activity. From all the tested phage-ThioFabs, the A121C cysteine engineered antibody exhibited<br>
maximal thiol reactivity. Even though wild type hu4D5Fabv8-phage was incubated with the same amounts of<br>
biotin-maleimide, these phage had little streptavidin binding indicating that preexisting cysteine residues<br>
40<br>
(involved in disulfide bond formation) from the hu4D5Fabv8 and Ml3 phage coat proteins did not interfere<br>
with the site-specific conjugation of biotin-maleimide. These results demonstrate that the phage ELISA assay<br>
can be used successfully to screen reactive thiol groups on the Fab surface.<br>
The PHESELECTOR assay allows screening of reactive thiol groups in antibodies. Identification of<br>
the A121C variant by this method is exemplary. The entire Fab molecule may be effectively searched to<br>
identify more ThioFab variants with reactive thiol groups. A parameter, fractional surface accessibility, was<br>
employed to identify and quantitate the accessibility of solvent to the amino acid residues in a polypeptide.<br>
The surface accessibility can be expressed as the surface area (A ) that can be contacted by a solvent<br>
molecule, e.g. water. The occupied space of water is approximated as a 1.4 A radius sphere. Software is<br>
freely available or licensable (Secretary to CCP4, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, WA4 4AD, United<br>
Kingdom, Fax: (+44) 1925 603825, or by internet: www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/INDEX.html) as the CCP4 Suite<br>
of crystallography programs which employ algorithms to calculate the surface accessibility of each amino acid<br>
of a protein with known x-ray crystallography derived coordinates ("The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein<br>
Crystallography" (1994) Acta. Cryst. D50:760-763). Two exemplary software modules that perform surface<br>
accessibility calculations are "AREAIMOL" and "SURFACE", based on the algorithms of B.Lee and<br>
F.M.Richards (1971) J.Mol.Biol. 55:379-400. AREAIMOL defines the solvent accessible surface of a protein<br>
as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule) as it rolls over the Van der Waals<br>
surface of the protein. AREAIMOL calculates the solvent accessible surface area by generating surface points<br>
on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and<br>
probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms.<br>
AREAIMOL finds the solvent accessible area of atoms in a PDB coordinate file, and summarizes the<br>
accessible area by residue, by chain and for the whole molecule. Accessible areas (or area differences) for<br>
individual atoms can be written to a pseudo-PDB output file. AREAIMOL assumes a single radius for each<br>
element, and only recognizes a limited number of different elements. Unknown atom types (i.e. those not in<br>
AREAIMOL's internal database) will be assigned the default radius of 1.8 A. The list of recognized atoms is:EAIMOL and SURFACE report absolute accessibilities, i.e. the number of square Angstroms (A).<br>
Fractional surface accessibility is calculated by reference to a standard state relevant for an amino acid within<br>
a polypeptide. The reference state is tripeptide Gly-X-Gly, where X is the amino acid of interest, and the<br>
reference state should be an 'extended' conformation, i.e. like those in beta-strands. The extended<br>
conformation maximizes the accessibility of X. A calculated accessible area is divided by the accessible area<br>
in a Gly-X-Gly tripeptide reference state and reports the quotient, which is the fractional accessibility. Percent<br>
accessibility is fractional accessibility multiplied by 100.<br>
Another exemplary algorithm for calculating surface accessibility is based on the SOLV module of<br>
the program xsae (Broger, C., F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel) which calculates fractional accessibility of an<br>
amino acid residue to a water sphere based on the X-ray coordinates of the polypeptide.<br>
The fractional surface accessibility for every amino acid in hu4D5Fabv7 was calculated using the<br>
crystal structure information (Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995). The fractional surface<br>
accessibility values for the amino acids of the light chain and heavy chain of hu4D5Fabv7 are shown in<br>
descending order in Table 1.<br>
The following two criteria were applied to identify the residues of hu4D5Fabv8 that can be<br>
engineered to replace with Cys residues:<br>
1. Amino acid residues that are completely buried are eliminated, i.e. less than 10% fractional<br>
surface accessibility. Table 1 shows there are 134 (light chain) and 151 (heavy chain) residues of<br>
hu4D5Fabv8 that are more than 10% accessible (fractional surface accessibility). The top ten most accessible<br>
Ser, Ala and Val residues were selected due to their close structural similarity to Cys over other amino acids,<br>
introducing only minimal structural constraints in the antibody by newly engineered Cys. Other cysteine<br>
replacement sites can also be screened, and may be useful for conjugation.<br>
2. Residues are sorted based on their role in functional and structural interactions of Fab. The<br>
residues which are not involved in antigen interactions and distant from the existing disulfide bonds were<br>
further selected. The newly engineered Cys residues should be distinct from, and not interfere with, antigen<br>
binding nor mispair with cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation.<br>
The following residues of hu4D5Fabv8 possessed the above criteria and were selected to be replaced<br>
with Cys: L-V15, L-A43, L-V110, L-A144, L-S168, H-A88, H-A121, H-S122, H-A175 and H-S179 (shown<br>
in Figure 1).<br>
Thiol reactivity may be generalized to any antibody where substitution of amino acids with reactive<br>
cysteine amino acids may be made within the ranges in the light chain selected from: L-10 to L-20; L-38 to L-<br>
48; L-105 to L-l 15; L-139 to L-149; L-163 to L-173; and within the ranges in the heavy chain selected from:<br>
H-35 to H-45; H-83 to H-93; H-l 14 to H-127; and H-170 to H-l 84, and in the Fc region within the ranges<br>
selected from H-268 to H-291; H-319 to H-344; H-370 to H-380; and H-395 to H-405.<br>
Thiol reactivity may also be generalized to certain domains of an antibody, such as the light chain<br>
constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Cysteine replacements<br>
resulting in thiol reactivity values of 0.6 and higher may be made in the heavy chain constant domains a, 8, e,<br>
7, and u of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively, including the IgG subclasses: IgGl,<br>
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2.<br>
It is evident from the crystal structure data that the selected 10 Cys mutants are far away from the<br>
antigen-combining site, such as the interface with HER2 in this case. These mutants can be tested<br>
experimentally for indirect effects on functional interactions. The thiol reactivities of all the Cys Fab variants<br>
were measured and calculated as described in Examples 1 and 2, and presented in Table 2. The residues LV15C,<br>
L-V1 IOC, H-A88C and H-A121C have reactive and stable thiol groups (Figures 3A and 3B). Mutants<br>
V15C, V110C, A144C, S168C are light chain Cys variants. Mutants A88C, A121C, A175C, S179C are heavy<br>
chain Cys variants. It was surprising and unexpected that the sites with high fractional surface accessibility<br>
did not have the highest thiol reactivity as calculated by the PHESELECTOR assay (Table 2). In other words,<br>
fractional surface accessibility (Tables 1, 2) did not correlate with thiol reactivity (Table 2). In fact, the Cys<br>
residues engineered at the sites with moderate surface accessibility of 20% to 80% (Figure 4A, Table 1), or<br>
partially exposed sites, like Ala or Val residues, exhibited better thiol reactivity, i.e. &gt;0.6, (Figure 3B, Table 2)<br>
than the Cys introduced at Ser residues, thus necessitating the use of PHESELECTOR assay in the screening<br>
of thiol reactive sites since the crystal structure information alone is not sufficient to select these sites (Figure<br>
3B and 4A).<br>
Thiol reactivity data is shown in Figures 3A and 3B for amino acid residues of 4D5 ThioFab Cys<br>
mutants: (3A) non-biotinylated (control) and (3B) biotinylated phage-ThioFabs. Reactive thiol groups on<br>
antibody/Fab surface were identified by PRESELECTOR assay analyses for the interaction of nonbiotinylated<br>
phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (3A) and biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (3B) with BSA (open box), HER2<br>
(grey box) or streptavidin (solid box). The assay was carried out as described in Example 2. Light chain<br>
variants are on the left side and heavy chain variants are on the right side. The binding of non-biotinylated<br>
4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants is low as expected, but strong binding to HER2 is retained. The ratio of binding to<br>
streptavidin and to HER2 of the biotinylated 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants gives the thiol reactivity values in<br>
Table 2. Background absorbance at 450 nm or small amounts of non-specific protein binding of the<br>
biotinylated 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants to BSA is also evident in Figure 3B. Fractional Surface Accessibility<br>
values of the selected amino acid residues that were replaced with a Cys residue are shown in Figure 4A.<br>
Fractional surface accessibility was calculated from the available hu4D5Fabv7 structure and shown on Table 1<br>
(Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995). The conformational parameters of the hu4D5Fabv7 and<br>
hu4D5Fabv8 structures are highly consistent and allow for determination of any correlation between fractional<br>
surface accessibility calculations of hu4D5Fabv7 and thiol reactivity of hu4D5Fabv8 cysteine mutants. The<br>
measured thiol reactivity of phage ThioFab Cys residues introduced at partially exposed residues (Ala or Val)<br>
have better thiol reactivity compared to the ones introduced at Ser residues (Table 2). It can be seen from the<br>
ThioFab Cys mutants of Table 2 that there is little or no correlation between thio reactivity values and<br>
fractional surface accessibility.<br>
Amino acids at positions L-15, L-43, L-110, L-144, L-168, H-40, H-88, H-119, H-121, H-122, H-<br>
175, and H-179 of an antibody may generally be mutated (replaced) with free cysteine amino acids. Ranges<br>
within about 5 amino acid residues on each side of these positions may also be replaced with free cysteine<br>
acids, i.e. L-10 to L-20; L-38 to L-48; L-105 to L-115; L-139 to L-149; L-163 to L-173; H-35 to H-45; H-83<br>
to H-93; H-l 14 to H-127; and H-170 to H-184, as well as the ranges in the Fc region selected from H-268 to<br>
H-291; H-319 to H-344; H-370 to H-380; and H-395 to H-405, to yield the cysteine engineered antibodies of<br>
the invention.<br>
L = light chain, H = heavy chain, A = alanine, S = serine, V = valine, C = cysteine<br>
' Thiol reactivity is measured as the ratio of 00450 nm for streptavidin binding to 00450 nm for HER2<br>
(antibody) binding (Example 2). Thiol reactivity value of 1 indicates complete biotinylation of the cysteine<br>
thiol.<br>
Two Cys variants from light chain (L-V15C and L-V1 IOC) and two from heavy chain (H-A88C and<br>
H-A121C) were selected for further analysis as these variants showed the highest thiol reactivity (Table 2).<br>
Unlike phage purification, Fab preparation may require 2-3 days, depending on the scale of<br>
production. During this time, thiol groups may lose reactivity due to oxidation. To probe the stability of thiol<br>
groups on hu4D5Fabv8-phage, stability of the thiol reactivity of phage-thioFabs was measured (Figure 4B).<br>
After ThioFab-phage purification, on day 1, day 2 and day 4, all the samples were conjugated with biotin-<br>
PEO-maleimide and probed with phage ELISA assay (PHESELECTOR) to test HER2 and streptavidin<br>
binding. L-V15C, L-V1 IOC, H-A88C and H-A121C retain significant amounts of thiol reactivity compared to<br>
other ThioFab variants (Figure 4B).<br>
LABELLED CYSTEINE ENGINEERED ANTIBODIES<br>
The cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be conjugated with any label moiety which<br>
can be covalently attached to the antibody through a reactive cysteine thiol group (Singh et al (2002) Anal.<br>
Biochem. 304:147-15; Harlow E. and Lane, D. (1999) Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Lundblad R.L. (1991) Chemical Reagents for Protein<br>
Modification, 2nd ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL). The attached label may function to: (i) provide a<br>
detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or<br>
second label, e.g. to give FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize interactions or increase<br>
affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility or cellpermeability,<br>
by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a capture moiety,<br>
to modulate ligand affinity, antibody/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.<br>
Labelled cysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting<br>
expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum. For diagnostic applications, the<br>
antibody will typically be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be<br>
generally grouped into the following categories:<br>
(a) Radioisotopes (radionuclides), such as 3H,' *C, 14C, 18F, 32P, 35S, MCu, 68Ga, 86Y, 99Tc,<br>
1UIn, 1231,1241,1251,1311,133Xe, l77Lu,2UAt,or213Bi. Radioisotope labelled antibodies are useful in<br>
receptor targeted imaging experiments. The antibody can be labeled with ligand reagents that bind, chelate or<br>
otherwise complex a radioisotope metal where the reagent is reactive with the engineered cysteine thiol of the<br>
antibody, using the techniques described in Current Protocols in Immunology, Volumes 1 and 2, Coligen et al,<br>
Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY, Pubs. (1991). Chelating ligands which may complex a metal ion<br>
include DOT A, DOTP, DOTMA, DTPA and TETA (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX). Radionuclides can be<br>
targetted via complexation with the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention (Wu et al (2005) Nature<br>
Biotechnology 23(9):1137-1146).<br>

(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates), fluorescein types<br>
including FITC, 5-carboxyfluorescein, 6-carboxy fluorescein; rhodamine types including TAMRA; dansyl;<br>
Lissamine; cyanines; phycoerythrins; Texas Red; and analogs thereof. The fluorescent labels can be<br>
conjugated to antibodies using the techniques disclosed in Current Protocols in Immunology, supra, for<br>
example. Fluorescent dyes and fluorescent label reagents include those which are commercially available<br>
from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, IL).<br>
(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available or disclosed (US 4275149). The enzyme<br>
generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various<br>
techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured<br>
spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemi luminescence of the<br>
substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent<br>
substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be<br>
measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of<br>
enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; US 4737456), luciferin,<br>
2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, tnalate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase<br>
(HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), p-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g.,<br>
glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as<br>
uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating<br>
enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al (1981) "Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-<br>
Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay", in Methods in Enzym. (ed J. Langone &amp; H. Van<br>
Vunakis), Academic Press, New York, 73:147-166.<br>
Examples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:<br>
(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the<br>
hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3',5,5'-<br>
tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride (TMB));<br>
(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and<br>
(iii) (3-D-galactosidase (p-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-p-Dgalactosidase)<br>
or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-D-galactosidase.<br>
Numerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general<br>
review, see US 4275149 and US 4318980.<br>
A label may be indirectly conjugated with a cysteine engineered antibody. For example, the antibody<br>
can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be<br>
conjugated with avidin or streptavidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to streptavidin and thus, the<br>
label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect<br>
conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant, the polypeptide variant is conjugated with a small hapten<br>
(e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten<br>
polypeptide variant (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide<br>
variant can be achieved (Hermanson, G. (1996) in Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press, San Diego).<br>
The polypeptide variant of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such<br>
as ELISA, competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays<br>
(Zola, (1987) Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp.147-158, CRC Press, Inc.).<br>
A detection label may be useful for localizing, visualizing, and quantitating a binding or recognition<br>
event. The labelled antibodies of the invention can detect cell-surface receptors. Another use for detectably<br>
labelled antibodies is a method of bead-based immunocapture comprising conjugating a bead with a<br>
fluorescent labelled antibody and detecting a fluorescence signal upon binding of a ligand. Similar binding<br>
detection methodologies utilize the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect to measure and detect antibodyantigen<br>
interactions.<br>
Detection labels such as fluorescent dyes and chemiluminescent dyes (Briggs et al (1997) "Synthesis<br>
of Functionalised Fluorescent Dyes and Their Coupling to Amines and Amino Acids," J. Chem. Soc., Perkin-<br>
Trans. 1:1051-1058) provide a detectable signal and are generally applicable for labelling antibodies,<br>
preferably with the following properties: (i) the labelled antibody should produce a very high signal with low<br>
background so that small quantities of antibodies can be sensitively detected in both cell-free and cell-based<br>
assays; and (ii) the labelled antibody should be photostable so that the fluorescent signal may be observed,<br>
monitored and recorded without significant photo bleaching. For applications involving cell surface binding of<br>
labelled antibody to membranes or cell surfaces, especially live cells, the labels preferably (iii) have good<br>
water-solubility to achieve effective conjugate concentration and detection sensitivity and (iv) are non-toxic to<br>
living cells so as not to disrupt the normal metabolic processes of the cells or cause premature cell death.<br>
Direct quantification of cellular fluorescence intensity and enumeration of fluorescently labelled<br>
events, e.g. cell surface binding of peptide-dye conjugates may be conducted on an system (FMAT® 8100<br>
HTS System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) that automates mix-and-read, non-radioactive assays<br>
with live cells or beads (Miraglia, "Homogeneous cell- and bead-based assays for high throughput screening<br>
using fluorometric microvolume assay technology", (1999) J. of Biomolecular Screening 4:193-204). Uses of<br>
labelled antibodies also include cell surface receptor binding assays, inmmunocapture assays, fluorescence<br>
linked immunosorbent assays (FLISA), caspase-cleavage (Zheng, "Caspase-3 controls both cytoplasmic and<br>
nuclear events associated with Fas-mediated apoptosis in vivo", (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:618-23;<br>
US 6372907), apoptosis (Vermes, "A novel assay for apoptosis. Flow cytometric detection of<br>
phosphatidylserine expression on early apoptotic cells using fluorescein labelled Annexin V" (1995) J.<br>
Immunol. Methods 184:39-51) and cytotoxicity assays. Fluorometric microvolume assay technology can be<br>
used to identify the up or down regulation by a molecule that is targeted to the cell surface (Swartzman, "A<br>
homogeneous and multiplexed immunoassay for high-throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume<br>
assay technology", (1999) Anal. Biochem. 271:143-51).<br>
Labelled cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are useful as imaging biomarkers and probes<br>
by the various methods and techniques of biomedical and molecular imaging such as: (i) MRI (magnetic<br>
resonance imaging); (ii) MicroCT (computerized tomography); (iii) SPECT (single photon emission computed<br>
tomography); (iv) PET (positron emission tomography) Chen et al (2004) Bioconjugate Chem. 15:41-49; (v)<br>
bioluminescence; (vi) fluorescence; and (vii) ultrasound. Immunoscintigraphy is an imaging procedure in<br>
which antibodies labeled with radioactive substances are administered to an animal or human patient and a<br>
picture is taken of sites in the body where the antibody localizes (US 6528624). Imaging biomarkers may be<br>
objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or<br>
pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types: Type 0 are<br>
natural history markers of a disease and correlate longitudinally with known clinical indices, e.g. MRI<br>
assessment of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis; Type I markers capture the effect of an<br>
intervention in accordance with a mechanism-of-action, even though the mechanism may not be associated<br>
with clinical outcome; Type II markers function as surrogate endpoints where the change in, or signal from,<br>
the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit to "validate" the targeted response, such as measured bone erosion in<br>
rheumatoid arthritis by CT. Imaging biomarkers thus can provide pharmacodynamic (PD) therapeutic<br>
information about: (i) expression of a target protein, (ii) binding of a therapeutic to the target protein, i.e.<br>
selectivity, and (iii) clearance and half-life pharmacokinetic data. Advantages of in vivo imaging biomarkers<br>
relative to lab-based biomarkers include: non-invasive treatment, quantifiable, whole body assessment,<br>
repetitive dosing and assessment, i.e. multiple time points, and potentially transferable effects from preclinical<br>
(small animal) to clinical (human) results. For some applications, bioimaging supplants or minimizes the<br>
number of animal experiments in preclinical studies.<br>
Radionuclide imaging labels include radionuclides such as H, C, C, F, P, S, Cu, Ga,<br>
86Y,99Tc, UV 1231,1241,12\ 13'l, '33Xe, 177Lu,2UAt,or213Bi. Theradionuclidemetal ioncanbe<br>
complexed with a chelating linker such as DOTA. Linker reagents such as DOTA-maleimide (4-<br>
maleimidobutyramidobenzyl-DOTA) can be prepared by the reaction of aminobenzyl-DOTA with 4-<br>
maleimidobutyric acid (Fluka) activated with isopropylchloroformate (Aldrich), following the procedure of<br>
Axworthy et al (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97(4): 1802-1807). DOTA-maleimide reagents react with<br>
the free cysteine amino acids of the cysteine engineered antibodies and provide a metal complexing ligand on<br>
the antibody (Lewis et al (1998) Bioconj. Chem. 9:72-86). Chelating linker labelling reagents such as DOTANHS<br>
(l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid mono (W-hydroxysuccinimide ester) are<br>
commercially available (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX). Receptor target imaging with radionuclide labelled<br>
antibodies can provide a marker of pathway activation by detection and quantitation of progressive<br>
accumulation of antibodies in tumor tissue (Albert et al (1998) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:1207-1210). The<br>
conjugated radio-metals may remain intracellular following lysosomal degradation.<br>

Peptides and proteins labelled with two moieties, a fluorescent reporter and quencher in sufficient<br>
proximity undergo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Reporter groups are typically fluorescent<br>
dyes that are excited by light at a certain wavelength and transfer energy to an acceptor, or quencher, group,<br>
with the appropriate Stokes shift for emission at maximal brightness. Fluorescent dyes include molecules with<br>
extended aromaticity, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and their derivatives. The fluorescent reporter may<br>
be partially or significantly quenched by the quencher moiety in an intact peptide. Upon cleavage of the<br>
peptide by a peptidase or protease, a detectable increase in fluorescence may be measured (Knight, C. (1995)<br>
"Fluorimetric Assays of Proteolytic Enzymes", Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, 248:18-34).<br>
The labelled antibodies of the invention may also be used as an affinity purification agent. In this<br>
process, the labelled antibody is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using<br>
methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen<br>
to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the<br>
material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized polypeptide<br>
variant. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will<br>
release the antigen from the polypeptide variant.<br>
Labelling reagents typically bear reactive functionality which may react (i) directly with a cysteine<br>
thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody to form the labelled antibody, (ii) with a linker reagent to form a<br>
linker-label intermediate, or (iii) with a linker antibody to form the labelled antibody. Reactive functionality<br>
of labelling reagents include: maleimide, haloacetyl, iodoacetamide succinimidyl ester (e.g. NHS, Nhydroxysuccinimide),<br>
isothiocyanate, sulfonyl chloride, 2,6-dichlorotriazinyl, pentafluorophenyl ester, and<br>
phosphoramidite, although other functional groups can also be used.<br>
An exemplary reactive functional group is N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS) of a carboxyl group<br>
substituent of a detectable label, e.g. biotin or a fluorescent dye. The NHS ester of the label may be<br>
preformed, isolated, purified, and/or characterized, or it may be formed in situ and reacted with a nucleophilic<br>
group of an antibody. Typically, the carboxyl form of the label is activated by reacting with some<br>
combination of a carbodiimide reagent, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or a uronium<br>
reagent, e.g. TSTU (O-(N-Succinimidyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate, HBTU (Obenzotriazol-<br>
l-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), or HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-lyl)-<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), an activator, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBt), and N-hydroxysuccinimide to give the NHS ester of the label. In some cases, the label and the<br>
antibody may be coupled by in situ activation of the label and reaction with the antibody to form the labelantibody<br>
conjugate in one step. Other activating and coupling reagents include TBTU (2-(lH-benzotriazo-lyl)-<br>
l-l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), TFFH (N,N',N",N'"-tetramethyluronium 2-fluorohexafluorophosphate),<br>
PyBOP (benzotriazole- 1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate,<br>
EEDQ (2-ethoxy-l-ethoxycarbonyl-l,2-dihydro-quinoline), DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide); DIPCDI<br>
(diisopropylcarbodiimide), MSNT (l-(mesitylene-2-sulfonyl)-3-nitro-lH-l,2,4-triazole, and aryl sulfonyl<br>
halides, e.g. triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.<br>
CONJUGATION OF BIOTIN-MALEIMIDE TO THIOFABS<br>
The above-described ThioFab properties were established in the presence of phage because fusion of<br>
the Fab to the phage coat protein could potentially alter Cys thiol accessibility or reactivity. Therefore, the<br>
ThioFab constructs were cloned into an expression vector under alkaline phosphatase promoter (Chang et al<br>
(1987) Gene 55:189-196) and the ThioFab expression was induced by growing E. coli cells in the phosphatefree<br>
medium. ThioFabs were purified on a Protein G SEPHAROSE™ column and analyzed on reducing and<br>
non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. These analyses allow assessment of whether ThioFabs retained their reactive<br>
thiol group or were rendered inactive by forming intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds. ThioFabs<br>
L-V15C, L-V110C, H-A88C, and H-A121C were expressed and purified by Protein-G SEPHAROSE™<br>
column chromatography (see methods sections for details). Purified proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE<br>
gel in reducing (with DTT) and non-reducing (without DTT) conditions. Other reducing agents such as BME<br>
(beta-mercaptoethanol) can used in the gel to cleave interchain disulfide groups. It is evident from SDSPAGE<br>
gel analysis that the major (~90%) fraction of ThioFab is in the monomeric form, while wild type<br>
hu4D5Fabv8 is essentially in the monomeric form (47 kDa).<br>
ThioFab (A121C) and wild type hu4D5Fabv8 were incubated with 100 fold excess of biotinmaleimide<br>
for 3 hours at room temperature and the biotinylated Fabs were loaded onto a Superdex-200™ gel<br>
filtration column. This purification step was useful in separating monomeric Fab from oligomeric Fab and also<br>
from excess free biotin-maleimide (or free cytotoxic drug).<br>
Figure 5 shows validation of the properties of ThioFab variants in the absence of the phage context.<br>
The proteins without phage fusion, hu4D5Fabv8 and hu4D5Fabv8-A121C (ThioFab-A121C), were expressed<br>
and purified using protein-G agarose beads followed by incubation with 100 fold molar excess of biotinmaleimide.<br>
Streptavidin and HER2 binding of a biotinylated cys engineered ThioFab and a non-biotinylated<br>
wild type Fab was compared. The extent of biotin conjugation (interaction with Streptavidin) and their binding<br>
ability to HER2 were monitored by ELISA analyses. Each Fab was tested at 2ng and 20ng.<br>
Biotinylated A121C ThioFab retained comparable HER2 binding to that of wild type hu4D5Fabv8<br>
(Figure 5). Wild type Fab and A121C-ThioFab were purified by gel filtration column chromatography. The<br>
two samples were tested for HER2 and Streptavidin binding by ELISA using goat anti-Fab-HRP as secondary<br>
antibody. Both wild type (open box) and ThioFab (dotted box) have similar binding to HER2 but only<br>
ThioFab retained Streptavidin binding. Only a background level of interaction with Streptavidin was observed<br>
with non-biotinylated wild type hu4D5Fabv8 (Figure 5). Mass spectral (LC-ESI-MS) analysis of biotinylated-<br>
ThioFab (A121C) resulted in a major peak with 48294.5 daltons compared to the wild type hu4D5Fabv8<br>
(47737 daltons). The 537.5 daltons difference between the two molecules exactly corresponds to a single<br>
biotin-maleimide conjugated to the ThioFab. Mass spec protein sequencing (LC-ESI-Tandem mass spec<br>
analysis) results further confirmed that the conjugated biotin molecule was at the newly engineered Cys<br>
residue (Table 4, Example 3).<br>
SITE SPECIFIC CONJUGATION OF BIOTIN-MALEIMIDE TO ALBUMIN BINDING PEPTIDE (ABPV<br>
THIOFABS<br>
Plasma-protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of<br>
short lived molecules. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. Serum albumin binding peptides<br>
(ABP) can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins, including alteration of tissue uptake,<br>
penetration, and diffusion. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the<br>
appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence (US 20040001827). A series of albumin binding<br>
peptides were identified by phage display screening (Dennis et al. (2002) "Albumin Binding As A General<br>
Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins" J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746).<br>
Compounds of the invention include ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002) J Biol Chem.<br>
277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 20040001827 at [0076] SEQ ID NOS: 9-22; and<br>
(iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, SEQ ID NOS: zl-z!4, and all of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Albumin Binding (ABP)-Fabs were engineered by fusing an albumin binding peptide to the Cterminus<br>
of Fab heavy chain in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio (1 ABP /1 Fab). It was shown that association of<br>
these ABP-Fabs with albumin increased their half life by more than 25 fold in rabbits and mice. The above<br>
described reactive Cys residues can therefore be introduced in these ABP-Fabs and used for site-specific<br>
conjugation with cytotoxic drugs followed by in vivo animal studies. Figure 9 shows a graphical albumin<br>
binding peptide-Fab fusion (ABP-Fab) linker drug conjugate.<br>
Exemplary albumin binding peptide sequences include, but are not limited to the amino acid<br>
sequences listed in SEQ ID NOS: 1-5:<br>
The albumin binding peptide (ABP) sequences bind albumin from multiple species (mouse, rat,<br>
rabbit, bovine, rhesus, baboon, and human) with Kd (rabbit) = 0.3 uM. The albumin binding peptide does not<br>
compete with ligands known to bind albumin and has a half life (TVi) in rabbit of 2.3 hr. ABP-ThioFab<br>
proteins were purified on BSA-SEPHAROSE™ followed by biotin-maleimide conjugation and purification on<br>
Superdex-S200 column chromatography as described in previous sections. Purified biotinylated proteins were<br>
homogeneous and devoid of any oligomeric forms (Example 4).<br>
Figure 6 shows the properties of Albumin Binding Peptide (ABP)-ThioFab variants. ELISA analyses<br>
were carried out to test the binding ability of ABP-hu4D5Fabv8-wt, ABP-hu4D5Fabv8-Vl IOC and ABPhu4D5Fabv8-<br>
A121C with rabbit albumin, streptavidin and HER2. Biotinylated ABP-ThioFabs are capable of<br>
binding to albumin and HER2 with similar affinity to that of wild type ABP-hu4D5Fabv8 as confirmed by<br>
ELISA (Figure 6) and BIAcore binding kinetics analysis (Table 3). An ELISA plate was coated with albumin,<br>
HER2 and SA as described. Binding of biotinylated ABP-ThioFabs to albumin, HER2 and SA was probed<br>
with anti-Fab HRP. Biotinylated ABP-ThioFabs were capable of binding to streptavidin compared to non<br>
biotinylated control ABP-hu4D5Fabv8-wt indicating that ABP-ThioFabs were conjugated with biotin<br>
maleimide like ThioFabs in a site specific manner as the same Cys mutants were used for both the variants<br>
(Figure 6).<br>
Table 3. BIAcore kinetic analysis for HER2 and rabbit albumin binding to biotinylated ABPhu4D5Fabv8<br>
Alternatively, an albumin-binding peptide may be linked to the antibody by covalent attachment<br>
through a linker moiety.<br>
ENGINEERING OF ABP-THIOFABS WITH TWO FREE THIOL GROUPS PER FAB<br>
The above results indicate that all four (L-V15C, L-V1 IOC, H-A88C and H-A121C) thioFab<br>
(cysteine engineered Fab antibodies) variants have reactive thiol groups that can be used for site specific<br>
conjugation with a label reagent, linker reagent, or drug-linker intermediate. L-V15C can be expressed and<br>
purified but with relatively low yields. However the expression and purification yields of L-V1 IOC, H-A88C<br>
and H-A121C variants were similar to that of hu4D5Fabv8. Therefore these mutants can be used for further<br>
analysis and recombined to get more than one thiol group per Fab. Towards this objective, one thiol group on<br>
the light and one on heavy chain were constructed to obtain two thiol groups per Fab molecule (L-V110C/H-<br>
A88C and L-V110C/H-A121C). These two double Cys variants were expressed in an E. coll expression<br>
system and purified. The homogeneity of purified biotinylated ABP-ThioFabs was found to be similar to that<br>
of single Cys variants.<br>
The effects of engineering two reactive Cys residues per Fab was investigated (Figure 7). The<br>
presence of a second biotin was tested by probing the binding of biotinylated ABP-ThioFab to SA using<br>
streptavidin-HRP (Figure 7). For HER2/Fab analysis, an EL1SA plate was coated with HER2 and probed with<br>
anti-Fab HRP. For SA/Fab analysis, an ELISA plate was coated with SA and probed with anti-Fab HRP. For<br>
SA/SA analysis, an ELISA plate was coated with SA and probed with SA-HRP. Figure 7. ELISA analyses for<br>
the interaction of biotinylated ABP-hu4D5Fabv8 cys variants with HER2, streptavidin (SA). HER2/Fab,<br>
SA/Fab and SA/SA indicate that their interactions were monitored by anti-Fab-HRP, SA-HRP, respectively.<br>
SA/Fab monitors the presence of single biotin per Fab and more than one biotin per Fab is monitored by<br>
SA/SA analysis. Binding of HER2 with double cys mutants is similar to that of single Cys variants (Figure 7).<br>
However the extent of biotinylation on double Cys mutants was higher compared to single Cys variants due to<br>
more than one free thiol group per Fab molecule (Figure 7).<br>
ENGINEERING OF THIO IgG VARIANTS OF TRASTUZUMAB<br>
Cysteine was introduced into the full-length monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®,<br>
Genentech Inc.) at certain residues. The single cys mutants H-A88C, H-A121C and L-V1 IOC of trastuzumab,<br>
and double cys mutants VI10C-A121C and VI10C-A121C of trastuzumab were expressed in CHO (Chinese<br>
Hamster Ovary) cells by transient fermentation in media containing 1 mM cysteine. The A88C mutant heavy<br>
chain sequence (450 aa) is SEQ ID NO:6. The A121C mutant heavy chain sequence (450 aa) is SEQ ID<br>
NO:7. The VI IOC mutant light chain sequence (214 aa) is SEQ ID NO:8.<br>

SEQ ID NO:39<br>
Cysteine engineered thio-3A5 anti-MUC16 antibodies comprise the following variable region heavy<br>
chain sequences with a free cysteine amino acid (SEQ ID NOS: 40-44).<br>
THIOL REACTIVITY OF THIOMABS<br>
The thiol reactivity of full length, IgG cysteine engineered antibodies (ThioMabs) was measured by<br>
biotinylation and streptavidin binding. A western blot assay was set up to screen the ThioMab that is<br>
specifically conjugated with biotin-maleimide. In this assay, the antibodies are analyzed on reducing SDSPAGE<br>
and the presence of Biotin is specifically probed by incubating with streptavidin-HRP. As seen from<br>
figure 18, the streptavidin-HRP interaction is either observed in heavy chain or light chain depending on<br>
which engineered cys variant is being used and no interaction is seen with wild type, indicating that ThioMab<br>
variants specifically conjugated the biotin at engineered Cys residue. Figure 18 shows denaturing gel analysis<br>
of reduced, biotinylated Thio-IgG variants after capture on immobilized anti-IgG-HRP (top gel) and<br>
streptavidin-HRP (bottom gel). Lane 1: 3A5H-A121C. Lane 2: 3A5L-V110C. Lane 3: 2H9 H-A121C.<br>
Lane 4: 2H9L-V110C. Lane 5: anti-EphB2R 2H9 parent, wild type. Each mutant (lanes 1-4) was captured<br>
by anti-IgG with HRP detection (top) indicating that selectivity and affinity were retained. Capture by<br>
immobilized streptavidin with HRP detection (bottom) confirmed the location of biotin on heavy and light<br>
chains. The location of cysteine mutation on the cysteine engineered antibodies in lanes 1 and 3 is the heavy<br>
chain. The location of cysteine mutation on the cysteine engineered antibodies in lanes 2 and 4 is the light<br>
chain. The cysteine mutation site undergoes conjugation with the biotin-maleimide reagent.<br>
Analysis of the ThioMab cysteine engineered antibodies of Figure 18 and a 2H9 V15C variant by<br>
LC/MS gave quantitative indication of thiol reactivity (Table 5).<br>
Table 5 LC/MS quantitation of biotinylation of ThioMabs - Thiol reactivity<br>
Cysteine engineering was conducted in the constant domain, i.e. Fc region, of IgG antibodies. A<br>
variety of amino acid sites were converted to cysteine sites and the expressed mutants, i.e. cysteine engineered<br>
antibodies, were assessed for their thiol reactivity. Biotinylated 2H9 ThioMab Fc variants were assessed for<br>
thiol reactivity by HRP quantitation by capture on immobilized streptavidin in an ELISA assay (Figure 19).<br>
An ELISA assay was established to rapidly screen the Cys residues with reactive Thiol groups. As depicted in<br>
Figure 19 schematic diagram, the streptavidin-biotin interaction is monitored by probing with anti-IgG-HRP<br>
followed by measuring absorbance at 450 nm. These results confirmed 2H9-ThioFc variants V282C, A287C,<br>
A339C, S375C and S400C had moderate to highest Thiol reactivity. The extent of biotin conjugation of 2H9<br>
ThioMab Fc variants was quantitated by LS/MS analysis as reported in Table 6. The LS/MS analysis<br>
confirmed that the A282C, S375C and S400C variants had 100% biotin conjugation and V284C and A339C<br>
had 50% conjugation, indicating the presence of a reactive cysteine thiol group. The other ThioFc variants,<br>
and the parent, wild type 2H9, had either very little biotinylation or none.<br>

THIOL REACTIVITY OF THIO-4D5 FAB LIGHT CHAIN VARIANTS<br>
Screening of a variety of cysteine engineered light chain variant Fabs of the antiErbB2 antibody 4D5<br>
gave a number of variants with a thiol reactivity value of 0.6 and higher (Table 7), as measured by the<br>
PHESELECTOR assay of Figure 8. The thiol reactivity values of Table 7 are normalized to the heavy chain<br>
4D5 ThioFab variant (HC-A121C) which is set at 100%, assuming complete biotinylation of HC-A121C<br>
variant, and represented as per cent values.<br>

ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES<br>
The cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be conjugated with any therapeutic agent,<br>
i.e. drug moiety, which can be covalently attached to the antibody through a reactive cysteine thiol group.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compound comprises a cysteine<br>
engineered antibody (Ab), and a drug moiety (D) wherein the antibody has one or more free cysteine amino<br>
acids having a thiol reactivity value in the range of 0.6 to 1.0, and the antibody is attached through the one or<br>
more free cysteine amino acids by a linker moiety (L) to D; the composition having Formula I:<br>
where p is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The number of drug moieties which may be conjugated via a thiol reactive<br>
linker moiety to an antibody molecule is limited by the number of cysteine residues which are introduced by<br>
the methods described herein. Exemplary ADC of Formula I therefore comprise antibodies which have 1,2,<br>
3, or 4 engineered cysteine amino acids.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of an antibody-drug conjugate compound (ADC) comprises a<br>
cysteine engineered antibody (Ab), an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) and a drug moiety (D) wherein the<br>
antibody is attached to the drug moiety by a linker moiety (L) and the antibody is attached to the albuminbinding<br>
peptide by an amide bond or a second linker moiety; the composition having Formula la:<br>
where pis 1,2, 3, or 4.<br>
The ADC compounds of the invention include those with utility for anticancer activity. In particular,<br>
the compounds include a cysteine-engineered antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to a<br>
drug moiety, i.e. toxin. When the drug is not conjugated to an antibody, the drug has a cytotoxic or cytostatic<br>
effect. The biological activity of the drug moiety is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. The<br>
antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to<br>
tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose, may be achieved.<br>
In one embodiment, the bioavailability of the ADC of the invention, or an intracellular metabolite of<br>
the ADC, is improved in a mammal when compared to a drug compound comprising the drug moiety of the<br>
ADC. Also, the bioavailability of the ADC, or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC is improved in a<br>
mammal when compared to the analog of the ADC not having the drug moiety.<br>
DRUG MOIETIES<br>
The drug moiety (D) of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) includes any compound, moiety or<br>
group which has a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect. Drug moieties include: (i) chemotherapeutic agents, which<br>
may function as microtubulin inhibitors, mitosis inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, or DNA intercalators;<br>
(ii) protein toxins, which may function enzymatically; and (iii) radioisotopes.<br>
Exemplary drug moieties include, but are not limited to, a maytansinoid, an auristatin, a dolastatin, a<br>
trichothecene, CC1065, a calicheamicin and other enediyne antibiotics, a taxane, an anthracycline, and<br>
stereoisomers, isosteres, analogs or derivatives thereof.<br>
Maytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art, and<br>
can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods, produced using genetic engineering<br>
techniques (see Yu et al (2002) PROC. NAT. ACAD. SCI. (USA) 99:7968-7973), or maytansinol and<br>
maytansinol analogues prepared synthetically according to known methods.<br>
Exemplary maytansinoid drug moieties include those having a modified aromatic ring, such as: C-19-<br>
dechloro (US 4256746) (prepared by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of ansamytocin P2); C-20-hydroxy<br>
(or C-20-demethyl) +/-C-19-dechloro (US Pat. Nos. 4361650 and 4307016) (prepared by demethylation using<br>
Streptomyces or Actinomyces or dechlorination using LAH); and C-20-demethoxy, C-20-acyloxy (-OCOR),<br>
+/-dechloro (U.S. Pat. No. 4,294,757) (prepared by acylation using acyl chlorides), and those having<br>
modifications at other positions<br>
Exemplary maytansinoid drug moieties also include those having modifications such as: C-9-SH (US<br>
4424219) (prepared by the reaction of maytansinol with H2S or P2Ss); C-14-alkoxymethyl(demethoxy/CH2<br>
OR)(US 4331598); C-14-hydroxymethyl or acyloxymethyl (CH2OH or CH2OAc) (US 4450254) (prepared<br>
from Nocardia); C-15-hydroxy/acyloxy (US 4364866) (prepared by the conversion of maytansinol by<br>
Streptomyces); C-15-methoxy (US Pat. Nos. 4313946 and 4315929) (isolated from Trewia nudlflora); C-18-<br>
N-demethyl (US Pat. Nos. 4362663 and 4322348) (prepared by the demethylation of maytansinol by<br>
Streptomyces); and 4,5-deoxy (US 4371533) (prepared by the titanium trichloride/LAH reduction of<br>
maytansinol). Many positions on maytansine compounds are known to be useful as the linkage position,<br>
depending upon the type of link. For example, for forming an ester linkage, the C-3 position having a<br>
hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl<br>
group and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group are all suitable.<br>
The drug moiety (D) of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula I include maytansinoids<br>
having the structure:<br>
where the wavy line indicates the covalent attachment of the sulfur atom of D to a linker (L) of an antibodydrug<br>
conjugate (ADC). R may independently be H or a C|-C6 alkyl selected from methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-<br>
propyl, 1-butyl, 2-methyl-l-propyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2-methyl-2-butyl,<br>
3-methyl-2-butyl, 3-methyl-l-butyl, 2-methy 1-1-butyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 2-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl-<br>
2-pentyl, 4-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl-3-pentyl, 2-methyl-3-pentyl, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butyl, and 3,3-dimethyl-2-<br>
butyl. The alkylene chain attaching the amide group to the sulfur atom may be methanyl, ethanyl, or propyl,<br>
i.e. m is 1, 2, or 3.<br>
Maytansine compounds inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting the formation of microtubules during<br>
mitosis through inhibition of polymerization of the microtubulin protein, tubulin (Remillard et al (1975)<br>
Science 189:1002-1005). Maytansine and maytansinoids are highly cytotoxic but their clinical use in cancer<br>
therapy has been greatly limited by their severe systemic side-effects primarily attributed to their poor<br>
selectivity for tumors. Clinical trials with maytansine had been discontinued due to serious adverse effects on<br>
the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system (Issel et al (1978) Can. Treatment. Rev. 5:199-207).<br>
Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody-drug conjugates because they<br>
are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification, derivatization of<br>
fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through<br>
the non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell<br>
lines (US 2005/0169933; WO 2005/037992; US 5208020).<br>
As with other drug moieties, all stereoisomers of the maytansinoid drug moiety are contemplated for<br>
the compounds of the invention, i.e. any combination of R and S configurations at the chiral carbons of D. In<br>
one embodiment, the maytansinoid drug moiety (D) will have the following stereochemistry:<br>
Exemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieties include: DM1, (CR2)m = CH2CH2; DM3,<br>
(CR2)m = CH2CH2CH(CH3); and DM4, (CR2)m = CH2CH2C(CH3)2, having the structures:<br>
The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type<br>
of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using<br>
conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-<br>
14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20<br>
position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of<br>
maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.<br>
The drug moiety (D) of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula I also include dolastatins<br>
and their peptidic analogs and derivatives, the auristatins (US Patent Nos. 5635483; 5780588). Dolastatins<br>
and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and<br>
cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584) and have<br>
anticancer (US 5663149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-<br>
2965). Various forms of a dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be covalently attached to an antibody<br>
through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (WO 02/088172;<br>
Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784; Francisco et al (2003) Blood 102(4): 1458-1465).<br>
Drug moieties include dolastatins, auristatins (US 5635483; US 5780588; US 5767237; US<br>
6124431), and analogs and derivatives thereof. Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with<br>
microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) Antimicrob.<br>
Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584) and have anticancer (US 5663149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et<br>
al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be<br>
attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug<br>
moiety (WO 02/088172).<br>
Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug<br>
moieties DE and DF, disclosed in: WO 2005/081711; Senter et al, Proceedings of the American Association<br>

The drug moiety (D) of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula I include the<br>
monomethylauristatin drug moieties MMAE and MMAF linked through the N-terminus to the antibody, and<br>
having the structures:<br>
Typically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or<br>
more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to<br>
the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schroder and K. Liibke, "The Peptides", volume 1, pp 76-136,1965,<br>
Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.<br>
The drug moiety includes calicheamicin, and analogs and derivatives thereof. The calicheamicin<br>
family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations.<br>
For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see US 5712374; US 5714586; US 5739116;<br>
US 5767285; US 5770701, US 5770710; US 5773001; US 5877296. Structural analogues of calicheamicin<br>
which may be used include, but are not limited to, 71,02 ,03, N-acetyl-yi , PSAG and 6 i (Hinman et al<br>
Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998).<br>
Protein toxins include: diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin<br>
A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain (Vitetta et al (1987) Science, 238:1098), abrin A chain,<br>

The radioisotope or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways (Fraker et al<br>
(1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57; "Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy"<br>
Chatal, CRC Press 1989). Carbon-14-labeled l-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic<br>
acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of a radionuclide to the antibody (WO<br>
A "Linker" (L) is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more<br>
Drug moieties (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula I.<br>
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a Linker having reactive functionality<br>
for binding to the Drug and to the Antibody. A cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody (Ab) can form<br>
a bond with a functional group of a linker reagent, a drug moiety or drug-linker intermediate.<br>
In one aspect, a Linker has a reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a<br>
nucleophilic cysteine present on an antibody. The cysteine thiol of the antibody is reactive with an<br>
electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker. Useful electrophilic groups include,<br>
but are not limited to, maleimide and haloacetamide groups.<br>
Cysteine engineered antibodies react with linker reagents or drug-linker intermediates, with<br>
electrophilic functional groups such as maleimide or cc-halo carbonyl, according to the conjugation method at<br>
page 766 of Klussman, et al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773, and according to the protocol of<br>

within the square brackets of Formulas Va and Vb, wherein -R -, Ab-, -W-, -Y-, -D, w and y are as defined<br>
above;<br>
In another embodiment, the linker may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more<br>
than one drug moiety through a branching, multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody (Sun et al (2002)<br>
Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12:2213-2215; Sun et al (2003) Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 11:1761-1768; King (2002) Tetrahedron Letters 43:1987-1990). Dendritic linkers can increase the<br>
molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading, which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where a<br>
cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be<br>
attached through a dendritic linker.<br>
AMINO ACID UNIT<br>
The linker may comprise amino acid residues. The Amino Acid unit (-Ww-), when present, links the<br>
antibody (Ab) to the drug moiety (D) of the cysteine engineered antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of the<br>
invention.<br>
is a dipeptide, tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide, hexapeptide, heptapeptide, octapeptide,<br>
nonapeptide, decapeptide, undecapeptide or dodecapeptide unit. Amino acid residues which comprise the<br>
Amino Acid unit include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring<br>
amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Each -W- unit independently has the formula denoted below in the<br>
square brackets, and w is an integer ranging from 0 to 12:<br>
The Amino Acid unit can be enzymatically cleaved by one or more enzymes, including a tumorassociated<br>
protease, to liberate the Drug moiety (-D), which in one embodiment is protonated in vivo upon<br>
release to provide a Drug (D).<br>
Useful -Ww units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a<br>
particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease. In one embodiment, a -Ww- unit is that whose<br>
cleavage is catalyzed by cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.<br>
Exemplary -Ww- Amino Acid units include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a<br>
pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or alaphe).<br>
Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (glygly-<br>
19 19 When R is other than hydrogen, the carbon atom to which R is attached is chiral. Each carbon<br>
atom to which R 19 is attached is independently in the (S) or (R) configuration, or a racemic mixture. Amino<br>
acid units may thus be enantiomerically pure, racemic, or diastereomeric.<br>
SPACER UNIT<br>
The Spacer unit (-Yy-), when present (y = 1 or 2), links an Amino Acid unit (-Ww-) to the drug<br>
moiety (D) when an Amino Acid unit is present (w = 1-12). Alternately, the Spacer unit links the Stretcher<br>
unit to the Drug moiety when the Amino Acid unit is absent. The Spacer unit also links the drug moiety to the<br>
antibody unit when both the Amino Acid unit and Stretcher unit are absent (w, y = 0). Spacer units are of two<br>
general types: self-immolative and non self-immolative. A non self-immolative Spacer unit is one in which<br>
part or all of the Spacer unit remains bound to the Drug moiety after cleavage, particularly enzymatic, of an<br>
Amino Acid unit from the antibody-drug conjugate or the Drug moiety-linker. When an ADC containing a<br>
glycine-glycine Spacer unit or a glycine Spacer unit undergoes enzymatic cleavage via a tumor-cell<br>
associated-protease, a cancer-cell-associated protease or a lymphocyte-associated protease, a glycine-glycine-<br>
Drug moiety or a glycine-Drug moiety is cleaved from Ab-Aa-Ww-. In one embodiment, an independent<br>
hydrolysis reaction takes place within the target cell, cleaving the glycine-Drug moiety bond and liberating the<br>
Drug.<br>
In another embodiment, -Yy- is a p-aminobenzylcarbamoyl (PAB) unit (see Schemes 2 and 3) whose<br>
phenylene portion is substituted with Qm wherein Q is -Ci-Cg alkyl, -O-(Ci-Cg alkyl), -halogen,- nitro or -<br>
cyano; and m is an integer ranging from 0-4.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of a non self-immolative Spacer unit (-Y-) are: -Gly-Gly-; -Gly-; -Ala-<br>
Phe-; -Val-Cit-.<br>
In one embodiment, a Drug moiety-linker or an ADC is provided in which the Spacer unit is absent<br>
(y=0), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
Alternatively, an ADC containing a self-immolative Spacer unit can release -D. In one embodiment,<br>
-Y- is a PAB group that is linked to -Ww- via the amino nitrogen atom of the PAB group, and connected<br>
Other examples of self-immolative spacers include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that<br>
are electronically similar to the PAB group such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (Hay et al. (1999)<br>
Bioorg. Med, Chem. Lett. 9:2237) and ortho or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo<br>
cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides<br>
(Rodrigues et al (1995) Chemistry Biology 2:223), appropriately substituted bicyclo[2.2.1] and bicyclo[2.2.2]<br>
75<br>
ring systems (Storm et al (1972) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 94:5815) and 2-aminophenylpropionic acid amides<br>
(Amsberry, et al (1990) J. Org. Chem. 55:5867). Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at<br>
glycine (Kingsbury et al (1984) J. Med. Chem. 27:1447) are also examples of self-immolative spacer useful in<br>
ADCs.<br>
In one embodiment, the Spacer unit is a branched bis(hydroxymethyl)styrene (BHMS), which can be<br>
used to incorporate and release multiple drugs, having the structure:<br>
comprising a 2-(4-aminobenzylidene)propane-l,3-diol dendrimer unit (WO 2004/043493; de Groot et al<br>
(2003) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4490-4494), wherein Q is -Cj-Cs alkyl, -O-(CrC8 alkyl), -halogen, -nitro or<br>
-cyano; m is an integer ranging from 0-4; n is 0 or 1; and p ranges ranging from 1 to 4.<br>
DENDRITIC LINKERS<br>
In another embodiment, linker L may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than<br>
one drug moiety through a branching, multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody (Sun et al (2002)<br>
Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12:2213-2215; Sun et al (2003) Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 11:1761-1768). Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading,<br>
which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one<br>
reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker.<br>
The following exemplary embodiments of dendritic linker reagents allow up to nine nucleophilic<br>
drug moiety reagents to be conjugated by reaction with the chloroethyl nitrogen mustard functional groups:<br><br>
In another embodiment of a Spacer unit, branched, dendritic linkers with self-immolative 2,6-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)-p-cresol and 2,4,6-tris(hydroxymethyl)-phenol dendrimer units (WO 2004/01993; Szalai<br>
et al (2003) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 125:15688-15689; Shamis et al (2004) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 126:1726-1731;<br>
Amir et al (2003) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4494-4499) may be employed as linkers in the compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the D moieties are the same.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the D moieties are different.<br>
Embodiments of the Formula I antibody-drug conjugate compounds include XHIa (val-cit), XHIb<br>
In another embodiment, a Linker has a reactive functional group which has a nucleophilic group that<br>
is reactive to an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody<br>
include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group<br>
of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit.<br>
Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine,<br>
thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody<br>
provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.<br>
Typically, peptide-type Linkers can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more<br>
amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the<br>
liquid phase synthesis method (E. SchrSder and K. Lttbke (1965) "The Peptides", volume 1, pp 76-136,<br>
Academic Press) which is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.<br>
Linker intermediates may be assembled with any combination or sequence of reactions including<br>
Spacer, Stretcher, and Amino Acid units. The Spacer, Stretcher, and Amino Acid units may employ reactive<br>
functional groups which are electrophilic, nucleophilic, or free radical in nature. Reactive functional groups<br>
include, but are not limited to:<br>
In another embodiment, the Linker may be substituted with groups which modulated solubility or<br>
reactivity. For example, a charged substituent such as sulfonate (-803") or ammonium, may increase water<br>
solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug<br>
moiety, or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab-L (antibody-linker intermediate) with D, or D-L (drug-linker<br>
intermediate) with Ab, depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.<br>
The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with<br>
linker reagents: BMPEO, BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB,<br>
SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and<br>
sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate), and including bis-maleimide reagents:<br>
DTME, 8MB, BMDB, BMH, BMOE, BM(PEOb, and BM(PEO)4, which are commercially available from<br>
Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Customer Service Department, P.O. Box 117, Rockford, IL. 61105 U.S.A, U.S.A<br>

Catalog. Bis-maleimide reagents allow the attachment of the thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody to<br>
a thiol-containing drug moiety, label, or linker intermediate, in a sequential or concurrent fashion. Other<br>
functional groups besides maleimide, which are reactive with a thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody,<br>
drug moiety, label, or linker intermediate include iodoacetamide, bromoacetamide, vinyl pyridine, disulfide,<br>
pyridyl disulfide, isocyanate, and isothiocyanate.<br>
Useful linker reagents can also be obtained via other commercial sources, such as Molecular<br>
Biosciences Inc.(Boulder, CO), or synthesized in accordance with procedures described in Toki et al (2002) J.<br>

linker to a thiol group of trastuzumab have the structure:<br>
where Ab is a cysteine engineered antibody; n is 0, 1, or 2; and p is 1,2,3, or 4.<br>
PREPARATION OF ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES<br>
The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions,<br>
conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a cysteine group of a<br>
cysteine engineered antibody with a linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent<br>
bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug<br>
moiety with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker intermediate D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction<br>
with a cysteine group of a cysteine engineered antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed<br>
with a variety of cysteine engineered antibodies, drug moieties, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug<br>
conjugates of Formula I.<br>
Antibody cysteine thiol groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with<br>
electrophilic groups on linker reagents and drug-linker intermediates including: (i) active esters such as NHS<br>
esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides, such as haloacetamides; (iii)<br>
aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups; and (iv) disulfides, including pyridyl disulfides, via<br>
sulfide exchange. Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol,<br>
hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups<br>
capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents.<br>
Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SSCHs, which can be reduced to the free thiol,<br>
May-SH, and reacted with a modified antibody (Chari et al (1992) Cancer Research 52:127-131) to generate a<br>
maytansinoid-antibody immunoconjugate with a disulfide linker. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates with<br>
disulflde linkers have been reported (WO 04/016801; US 6884874; US 2004/039176 Al; WO 03/068144; US<br>
2004/001838 Al; US Patent Nos. 6441163, 5208020,5416064; WO 01/024763). The disulflde linker SPP is<br>
constructed with linker reagent N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate.<br>
Under certain conditions, the cysteine engineered antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation<br>
with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or<br>
TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec<br>
Ventures, Beverly, MA). Full length, cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in<br>
CHO cells were reduced with about a 50 fold excess of TCEP for 3 hrs at 37 °C to reduce disulflde bonds<br>
which may form between the newly introduced cysteine residues and the cysteine present in the culture media.<br>
The reduced ThioMab was diluted and loaded onto HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and<br>
eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. Disulfide bonds were reestablished between cysteine<br>
residues present in the parent Mab with dilute (200 nM) aqueous copper sulfate (CuSCU) at room temperature,<br>
overnight. Other oxidants, i.e. oxidizing agents, and oxidizing conditions, which are known in the art may be<br>
used. Ambient air oxidation is also effective. This mild, partial reoxidation step forms intrachain disulfides<br>
efficiently with high fidelity. An approximate 10 fold excess of drug-linker intermediate, e.g. BM(PEO)4-<br>
DM1 was added, mixed, and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form<br>
the ThioMab antibody-drug conjugate. The conjugation mixture was gel filtered and loaded and eluted<br>
through a HiTrap S column to remove excess drug-linker intermediate and other impurities.<br>
Figure 15 shows the general process to prepare a cysteine engineered antibody expressed from cell<br>
culture for conjugation. Cysteine adducts, presumably along with various interchain disulfide bonds, are<br>
reductively cleaved to give a reduced form of the antibody. The interchain disulfide bonds between paired<br>
cysteine residues are reformed under partial oxidation conditions, such as exposure to ambient oxygen. The<br>
newly introduced, engineered, and unpaired cysteine residues remain available for reaction with linker<br>
reagents or drug-linker intermediates to form the antibody conjugates of the invention. The ThioMabs<br>
expressed in mammalian cell lines result in externally conjugated Cys adduct to an engineered Cys through -<br>
S-S- bond formation. Hence the purified ThioMabs have to be treated with reduction and oxidation procedures<br>
as described in Example 11 to produce reactive ThioMabs. These ThioMabs are used to conjugate with<br>
maleimide containing cytotoxic drugs, fluorophores, and other labels.<br>
A variety of ThioFab and ThioMab antibody-drug conjugates were prepared (Examples 4-8). Cysteine<br>
mutant hu4D5Fabv8 (VI IOC) was conjugated with the maytansinoid drug moiety DM1 with a bis-maleimido<br>
linker reagent BMPEO to form hu4D5Fabv8 (VI IOC) -BMPEO-DM1 (Example 8).<br>
IN VITRO CELL PROLIFERATION ASSAYS<br>
Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is measured by:<br>
exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins, e.g. HER2, to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture<br>
medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability.<br>
Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of<br>
apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC of the invention.<br>
The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay (Figures<br>
10 and 1 1 , Example 9). The CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available<br>
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of<br>
Coleoptera luciferase (US Patent Nos. 5583024; 5674713 and 5700670). This cell proliferation assay<br>
determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of<br>
metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; US 6602677). The CellTiter-<br>
Glo® Assay was conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening<br>
(HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding<br>
the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo® Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell<br>
washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15<br>
cells/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated<br>
continuously with ADC, or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally, cells treated briefly, i.e.<br>
3 hours, showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.<br>
The homogeneous "add-mix-measure" format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent<br>
signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number<br>
of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo® Assay generates a "glow-type" luminescent signal, produced by<br>
the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and<br>
medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle<br>
Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of<br>
ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors<br>
and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation<br>
assay can be used with various multiwell formats, e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by<br>
luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units<br>
(RLU), measured over time. Alternatively, photons from luminescence can be counted in a scintillation<br>
counter in the presence of a scintillant. The light units can be represented then as CPS - counts per second.<br>
Luciferase<br>
The anti-proliferative effects of antibody-drug conjugates were measured by the cell proliferation, in<br>
vitro cell killing assay above against the SK-BR-3 breast tumor cell line (Figures 10 and 11). ICso values of<br>
the ADC were established against SK-BR-3 cells, which are known to overexpress HER2 receptor protein.<br>
Figure 10 shows that trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl (IC50 = 0.008-0.015 ug/ml) was more potent than the<br>
heavy chain cysteine mutant conjugate hu4D5Fabv8-(A121Q-BMPEO-DM1 (IC50= 0.04ng/ml). Both<br>
conjugates were significantly more potent in cell killing than naked trastuzumab (ICso = 0.1 ng/ml). Drug<br>
loading for trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl was 2.8 DMl/Ab and for hu4D5Fabv8 (A121Q-BMPEO-DM1 was 0.6<br>
DMl/Ab.<br>
Figure 11 shows that trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl (ICso = 0.008-0.015 u,g/ml) was more potent than the<br>
light chain cysteine mutant hu4D5Fabv8 (VI10Q-BMPEO-DM1 (IC50 = 0.07 ug/ml). Both conjugates were<br>
more potent in cell killing than naked trastuzumab (ICso = 0.1 ug/ml). Drug loading for trastuzumab-SMCCDMl<br>
was 2.8 DMl/Ab and for hu4D5Fabv8 (VI 10C)-BMPEO-DM1 was 0.9 DMl/Ab.<br>
Full-length IgG ThioMab conjugates were tested for in vitro, cell proliferation efficacy and compared<br>
with parent antibodies. Figure 20 shows the results of an assay of SK.-BR-3 cells treated with: parent<br>
antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®, Genentech, Inc.); trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl with a drug loading of<br>
about 3.4 DMl/Ab; and thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1 with a drug loading of about 1.6 DMl/Ab.<br>
The trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl conjugate is linked to the antibody via the amino reactive, NHS ester SMCC<br>
linker reagent, whereas the thio-trastuzumab (A121C) -BMPEO-DMl conjugates is linked via the thiol<br>
reactive, maleimide BMPEO linker reagent. Both conjugates were potent against SK-BR-3 cells and showed<br>
comparable activity, whereas trastuzumab did not exert a cytotoxic effect. Figure 21A shows the results of an<br>
assay of HT 1080EphB2 cells treated with: parent 2H9 anti-EphB2R; and thio 2H9 (A121C) BMPEO-DMl<br>
conjugate. Figure 21B shows the results of an assay of BT 474 cells treated with: parent 2H9 anti-EphB2R;<br>
and thio 2H9 (A 121C) BMPEO-DMl conjugate. Against both HT 1080EphB2 and BT 474 cells, the 2H9<br>
ThioMab conjugate was more potent than the parent 2H9 antibody conjugate. The conjugate Thio-2H9-<br>
BMPEO-DM1 showed functional cell killing activity in EphB2 specific cell line (HT1080EphB2) compared to<br>
a non EphB2 cell line, BT474 in which only marginal activity is observed.<br>
Antibody drug conjugates were compared where the antibody is a parent antibody and where the<br>
antibody is a cysteine engineered antibody. Figure 22 shows the results of an assay of PC3/neo cells treated<br>
with: 3A5 anti MUC16-SMCC-DM1; and thio 3A5 (A121C) BMPEO-DMl. Figure 23 shows the results of<br>
an assay of PC3/MUC16 cells treated with: 3A5 anti MUC16-SMCC-DM1; and thio 3A5 (A121C) BMPEODMl.<br>
Figure 24 shows the results of an assay of OVCAR-3 cells treated with: 3A5 anti MUC16-SMCCDM1;<br>
and thio 3A5 (A121C) BMPEO-DMl. Thio-3A5-BMPEO-DMl did not show any significant cell<br>
killing activity in the control PC3/neo cell line, whereas it showed comparable activity to 3A5-SMCC-DM1 in<br>
the PC3/MUC16 cell line. Thio-3A5-DMl conjugate also showed activity in the OVCAR-3 that expresses<br>
endogenous MUC16 antigen.<br>
IN VIVO EFFICACY<br>
The in vivo efficacy of two albumin binding peptide-DMl (maytansinoid)-antibody-drug conjugates<br>
(ADC) of the invention was measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model (Figure 12,<br>
Example 10). An allograft was propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to,<br>
or responds poorly to, HERCEPTIN® therapy. Subjects were treated once with ABP-rhuFab4D5-cys(light<br>
chain)-DMl; ABP-rhuFab4D5-cys(heavy chain)-DMl; and placebo PBS buffer control (Vehicle) and<br>
monitored over 3 weeks to measure the time to tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor shrinkage.<br>
The term Ti is the number of animals in the study group with tumor at T = 0 4- total animals in group.<br>
The term PR is the number of animals attaining partial remission of tumor •*• animals with tumor at T = 0 in the<br>
group. The term CR is the number of animals attaining complete remission of tumor •*• animals with tumor T = 0 in the group. The term TDV is the tumor doubling time, i.e. time in days for the control tumor volume<br>
to double.<br>
The seven mice treated with 25 mg per kg (1012 ug/m2 of DM1) of ABP-rhuFab4D5-cys(light<br>
chain)-DMl were all tumor-positive and gave one animal with partial remission after 20 days. The seven<br>
mice treated with 37.5 mg per kg (1012 ug/m of DM1) of ABP-rhuFab4D5-cys(heavy chain)-DMl were all<br>
tumor-positive and gave four animals with partial remission after 20 days.<br>
The full length IgG ThioMab antibody variant with the A121C cysteine mutation and conjugated to<br>
the BMPEO linker and DM1 drug moiety was tested against the parent trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl conjugate in<br>
MMTV-HER2 Fo5 tumor-bearing mice. Tumor size at day 0 of injection was about 100-200 mm in size.<br>
Figure 25 shows the mean tumor volume change over 21 days in athymic nude mice with MMTV-HER2 Fo5<br>
mammary tumor allografts, after a single dose on Day 0 with: Vehicle (Buffer); trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl 10<br>
mg/kg;thiotrastuzumab(A121C)-SMCC-DMl 21 mg/kgandthio trastuzumab(A121C)-SMCC-DMl 10<br>
It can be seen from Figure 25 that each conjugate exerts a significant effect of retarding tumor growth<br>
relative to placebo (Vehicle). Each of the ten mice in the four groups above received a single injection at day<br>
1. The parent trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl conjugate was loaded with more than twice (3.4 DMl/Ab) the<br>
number of drug moieties than the cysteine engineered thio-trastuzumab (A121Q-BMPEO-DM1 conjugate<br>
(1.6 DMl/Ab). The effective amount of DM1 was thus approximately equal between parent trastuzumab-<br>
SMCC-DMl and the higher dose (21 mg Ab) thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1. These two sample<br>
showed the most potency. After 14 days post-injection, most of the animals receiving these conjugates were<br>
in partial or complete remission. The lower efficacy of the lower dose thio-trastuzumab (A121Q-BMPEODM1<br>
sample confirmed a DM1 dose-related response. Thio-Trastuzumab-DMl either dosed in equivalent<br>
antibody (lOmg/kg) or DM1 drug (21mg/kg) quantity to that of control trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl conjugate.<br>
As seen from the Figure 25, Thio-BMPEO-DM 1 (21mg/kg) showed slightly better response than that of<br>
trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl group as some of the animals showed complete response with Thiomab-DMl<br>
whereas there was only partial response with trastuzumab-SMCC-DMl.<br>
ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES<br>
The antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate<br>
to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention are<br>
typically prepared for parenteral administration, i.e. bolus, intravenous, intratumor injection with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody-drug<br>
conjugate (ADC) having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A.<br>
Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution.<br>
Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants<br>
including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride;<br>
hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol;<br>
alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and mcresol);<br>
low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin,<br>
gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine,<br>
glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates<br>
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol,<br>
trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes);<br>
and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). For example,<br>
lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97/04801, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example,<br>
by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatinmicrocapsules<br>
and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems<br>
(for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in<br>
macroetnulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A.<br>
Ed. (1980).<br>
Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations<br>
include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC, which matrices are in<br>
the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include<br>
polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides<br>
(US 3773919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable<br>
microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-<br>
hydroxybutyric acid.<br>
The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile, which is readily accomplished<br>
by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations<br>
may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in<br>
the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the<br>
active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the<br>
formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with<br>
liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose,<br>
sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such<br>
as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty<br>
acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic<br>
alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester<br>
derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous<br>
suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or<br>
more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or<br>
saccharin.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such<br>
as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the<br>
known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned<br>
above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized<br>
powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and<br>
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent<br>
or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single<br>
dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For<br>
example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 ug of the<br>
active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30<br>
mL/hr can occur.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection<br>
solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation<br>
10<br>
isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may<br>
include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are disfavored due to hydrolysis or denaturation<br>
in the gut, formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as<br>
capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.<br>
The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed<br>
ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of<br>
the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection<br>
solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously<br>
described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as<br>
herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as<br>
above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the<br>
purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise<br>
inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary<br>
compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.<br>
ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATE TREATMENTS<br>
It is contemplated that the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the present invention may be used to<br>
treat various diseases or disorders, e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary<br>
conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid<br>
malignancies. Others include neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial,<br>
stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic, including autoimmune, disorders.<br>
The ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further<br>
tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed<br>
similar to the clinical trials testing the efficacy of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody HERCEPTIN® in<br>
patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anti-cancer<br>
therapy as reported by Baselga et al. (1996) J. Clin. Oncol. 14:737-744. The clinical trial may be designed to<br>
evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens, such as radiation and/or<br>
chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and/or cytotoxic agents.<br>
Generally, the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer.<br>
Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastema,<br>
sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include<br>
squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, nonsmall<br>
cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the<br>
peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic<br>
cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer,<br>
colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma,<br>
kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma,<br>
penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.<br>
The cancer may comprise HER2-expressing cells, such that the ADC of the present invention are able<br>
to bind to the cancer cells. To determine ErbB2 expression in the cancer, various diagnostic/prognostic assays<br>
are available. In one embodiment, ErbB2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC, e.g. using the<br>
HERCEPTEST (Dako). Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC<br>
assay and accorded a ErbB2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows: Score 0, no staining is observed or<br>
membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of tumor cells; Score 1+, a faint/barely perceptible membrane<br>
staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells, the cells are only stained in part of their membrane;<br>
Score 2+, a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells;<br>
Score 3+, a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells.<br>
Those tumors with 0 or 1+ scores for ErbB2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not<br>
overexpressing ErbB2, whereas those tumors with 2+ or 3+ scores may be characterized as overexpressing<br>
ErbB2.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, FISH assays such as the INFORM™ (Ventana Co., Ariz.) or<br>
PATHVISION™ (Vysis, 111.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to<br>
determine the extent (if any) of ErbB2 overexpression in the tumor.<br>
Autoimmune diseases for which the ADC compounds may be used in treatment include<br>
rheumatologic disorders (such as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, SjOgren's syndrome, scleroderma, lupus<br>
such as SLE and lupus nephritis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, cryoglobulinemia, anti-phospholipid antibody<br>
syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis), osteoarthritis, autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders (such as, for<br>
example, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), autoimmune gastritis and<br>
pernicious anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and celiac<br>
disease), vasculitis (such as, for example, ANCA-associated vasculitis, including Churg-Strauss vasculitis,<br>
Wegener's granulomatosis, and polyarteriitis), autoimmune neurological disorders (such as, for example,<br>
multiple sclerosis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's<br>
disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune polyneuropathies), renal disorders (such as, for example,<br>
glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Berger's disease), autoimmune dermatologic disorders<br>
(such as, for example, psoriasis, urticaria, hives, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and cutaneous<br>
lupus erythematosus), hematologic disorders (such as, for example, thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia), atherosclerosis,<br>
uveitis, autoimmune hearing diseases (such as, for example, inner ear disease and hearing loss), Behcet's<br>
disease, Raynaud's syndrome, organ transplant, and autoimmune endocrine disorders (such as, for example,<br>
diabetic-related autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), Addison's disease,<br>
and autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease and thyroiditis)). More preferred such diseases include,<br>
for example, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, lupus, multiple sclerosis,<br>
SjOgren's syndrome, Graves' disease, IDDM, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and glomerulonephritis.<br>
For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type<br>
of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is<br>
administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and<br>
response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered<br>
to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease,<br>
about 1 ng/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to<br>
the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A<br>
typical daily dosage might range from about 1 ug/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors<br>
mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to<br>
about 10 mg/kg of patient weight.<br>
For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is<br>
sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises<br>
administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2<br>
mg/kg of an anti-ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is<br>
easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.<br>
COMBINATION THERAPY<br>
An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical<br>
combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anticancer<br>
properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen<br>
preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect<br>
each other.<br>
The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory<br>
agent, anti-hormonal agent, and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in<br>
amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the<br>
invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulinforming<br>
inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.<br>
Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent<br>
identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous<br>
or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more<br>
administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a<br>
single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is<br>
a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.<br>
In one embodiment, treatment with an ADC involves the combined administration of an anticancer<br>
agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including<br>
coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes<br>
(such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) and/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such<br>
chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer's instructions or as determined empirically<br>
by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in<br>
"Chemotherapy Service", (1992) Ed., M.C. Perry, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.<br>
The ADC may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such<br>
as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in<br>
dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient<br>
may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone<br>
independent, the ADC (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It<br>
may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction<br>
associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic<br>
regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and/or radiation therapy.<br>
Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be<br>
lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents<br>
or treatments.<br>
The combination therapy may provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e. the effect achieved<br>
when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the<br>
compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated<br>
and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by<br>
alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in<br>
alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered<br>
sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an<br>
effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination<br>
therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.<br>
METABOLITES OF THE ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES<br>
Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC<br>
compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such<br>
products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic<br>
cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and<br>
unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a<br>
mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.<br>
Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. '^C or ^H) ADC,<br>
administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat,<br>
mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30<br>
seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples.<br>
These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of<br>
binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional<br>
fashion, e.g. by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as<br>
conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long<br>
as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
LABELLED ANTIBODY IMAGING METHODS<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, cysteine engineered antibodies may be labelled through the<br>
cysteine thiol with radionuclides, fluorescent dyes, bioluminescence-triggering substrate moieties,<br>
chetniluminescence-triggering substrate moieties, enzymes, and other detection labels for imaging<br>
experiments with diagnostic, pharmacodynamic, and therapeutic applications. Generally, the labelled cysteine<br>
engineered antibody, i.e. "biomarker" or "probe", is administered by injection, perfusion, or oral ingestion to a<br>
living organism, e.g. human, rodent, or other small animal, a perfused organ, or tissue sample. The<br>
distribution of the probe is detected over a time course and represented by an image.<br>
ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or "kit", containing materials<br>
useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a<br>
container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for<br>
example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials<br>
such as glass or plastic. The container holds an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composition which is<br>
effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an<br>
intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one<br>
active agent in the composition is an ADC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used<br>
for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture<br>
may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as<br>
bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution.<br>
It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other<br>
buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of Biotinvlated ThioFab Phage<br>
ThioFab-phage (5 x 1012 phage particles) were reacted with 150 fold excess of biotin-PEO-maleimide<br>
((+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctainediamine, Oda et al (2001) Nature Biotechnology<br>
19:379-382, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) for 3 hours at room temperature. Excess biotin-PEO-maleimide was<br>
removed from biotin-conjugated phage by repeated PEG precipitations (3-4 times). Other commercially<br>
available biotinylation reagents with electrophilic groups which are reactive with cysteine thiol groups may be<br>
used, including Biotin-BMCC, PEO-Iodoacetyl Biotin, lodoacetyl-LC-Biotin, and Biotin-HPDP (Pierce<br>
Biotechnology, Inc.), and N01-^- maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).<br>
Other commercial sources for biotinylation, bifunctional and multifunctional linker reagents include<br>
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, and Sigma, St. Louis, MO.<br>
Biotin-PEO-maleimide<br>
Example 2 - PHESELECTOR Assay<br>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA), erbB2 extracellular domain (HER2) and streptavidin (100 ul of 2<br>
ug/ml) were separately coated on Maxisorp 96 well plates. After blocking with 0.5% Tween-20 (in PBS),<br>
biotinylated and non-biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8-ThioFab-Phage (2x10 phage particles) were incubated for 1<br>
hour at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled secondary<br>
antibody (anti-M13 phage coat protein, pVIII protein antibody). Figure 8 illustrates the PHESELECTOR<br>
Assay by a schematic representation depicting the binding of Fab or ThioFab to HER2 (top) and biotinylated<br>
ThioFab to streptavidin (bottom).<br>
Standard HRP reaction was carried out and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Thiol reactivity<br>
was measured by calculating the ratio between OD450 for streptavidin/OD4so for HER2. A thiol reactivity<br>
value of 1 indicates complete biotinylation of the cysteine thiol. In the case of Fab protein binding<br>
measurements, hu4D5Fabv8 (2-20 ng) was used followed by incubation with HRP labeled goat polyclonal<br>
anti-Fab antibodies.<br>
Example 3a - Expression and Purification of ThioFabs<br>
ThioFabs were expressed upon induction in 34B8, a non-suppressor E. coli strain (Baca et al (1997)<br>
Journal Biological Chemistry 272(16):10678-84). The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in PBS<br>
(phosphate buffered saline), total cell lysis was performed by passing through a microfluidizer and the<br>
ThioFabs were purified by affinity chromatography with protein G SEPHAROSE™ (Amersham).<br>
ThioFabs L-V15C, L-V1 IOC, H-A88C, and H-A121C were expressed and purified by Protein-G<br>
SEPHAROSE™ column chromatography. Oligomeric-Fab was present in fractions 26 to 30, and most of the<br>
monomeric form was in fractions 31-34. Fractions consisting of the monomeric form were pooled and<br>
analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with wild type hu4D5Fabv8and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel in reducing (with<br>
DTT or BME) and non-reducing (without DTT or BME) conditions. Gel filtration fractions of A121CThioFab<br>
were analyzed on non-reducing SDS-PAGE.<br>
ThioFabs were conjugated with biotin-PEO-maleimide as described above and the biotinylated-<br>
ThioFabs were further purified by Superdex-200™ (Amersham) gel filtration chromatography, which<br>
eliminated the free biotin-PEO-maleimide and the oligomeric fraction of ThioFabs. Wild type hu4D5Fabv8<br>
and hu4D5Fabv8 A121C-ThioFab (0.5 mg in quantity) were each and separately incubated with 100 fold<br>
molar excess of biotin-PEO-maleimide for 3 hours at room temperature and loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel<br>
filtration column to separate free biotin as well as oligomeric Fabs from the monomeric form.<br>
Example 3b - Analysis of ThioFabs<br>
Enzymatic digest fragments of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A 121C) ThioFab and wild type<br>
hu4D5Fabv8 were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (LS-ESIMS)<br>
The difference between the 48294.5 primary mass of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A 121C) and the 47737.0<br>
primary mass of wild type hu4D5Fabv8 was 557.5 mass units. This fragment indicates the presence of a<br>
single biotin-PEO-maleimide moiety (C23H36NsO7S2). Table 4 shows assignment of the fragmentation values<br>
which confirms the sequence.<br>

Example 8 - Preparation of hu4D5Fabv8-(Vl IOC) ThioFab-BMPEO-DMl<br>
The free cysteine on hu4D5Fabv8-(Vl IOC) ThioFab was modified by the bis-maleimido reagent<br>
BM(PEO)4 (Pierce Chemical), leaving an unreacted maleimido group on the surface of the antibody. This<br>
was accomplished by dissolving BM(PEO)4 in a 50% ethanol/water mixture to a concentration of 10 mM and<br>
adding a tenfold molar excess of BM(PEO)4 to a solution containing hu4D5Fabv8-(Vl IOC) ThioFab in<br>
phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of approximately 1.6 mg/ml (10 micromolar) and allowing it to<br>
react for 1 hour. Excess BM(PEO)4 was removed by gel filtration (HiTrap column, Pharmacia) in 30 mM<br>
citrate, pH 6 with 150 mM NaCl buffer. An approximate 10 fold molar excess DM1 dissolved in dimethyl<br>
acetamide (DMA) was added to the hu4D5Fabv8-(Vl IOC) ThioFab-BMPEO intermediate.<br>
Dimethylformamide (DMF) may also be employed to dissolve the drug moiety reagent. The reaction mixture<br>
was allowed to react overnight before gel filtration or dialysis into PBS to remove unreacted drug. Gel<br>
filtration on S200 columns in PBS was used to remove high molecular weight aggregates and furnish purified<br>
hu4D5Fabv8-(Vl IOC) ThioFab-BMPEO-DMl.<br>
By the same protocol, hu4D5Fabv8 (A 121C) ThioFab-BMPEO-DMl was prepared.<br>
Example 9 • In vitro cell proliferation assay<br>
Efficacy of ADC were measured by a cell proliferation assay employing the following protocol<br>
(CellTiter Glo Luminiscent Cell Viability Assay, Promega Corp. Technical Bulletin TB288; Mendoza et al<br>
(2002) Cancer Res. 62:5485-5488):<br>
1. An aliquot of 100 ul of cell culture containing about 104 cells (SKBR-3, BT474, MCF7 or MDAMB-<br>
468) in medium was deposited in each well of a 96-well, opaque-walled plate.<br>
2. Control wells were prepared containing medium and without cells.<br>
3. ADC was added to the experimental wells and incubated for 3-5 days.<br>
4. The plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.<br>
5. A volume of CellTiter-Glo Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium present in each well<br>
was added.<br>
6. The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.<br>
7. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescence signal.<br>
8. Luminescence was recorded and reported in graphs as RLU = relative luminescence units.<br>
Certain cells are seeded at 1000-2000/well (PC3 lines) or 2000-3000/well (OVCAR-3) in a 96-well<br>
plate, 50 uL/well. After one (PC3) or two (OVCAR-3) days, ADC are added in 50 uL volumes to final<br>
concentration of 9000, 3000,1000, 333,111, 37,12.4, 4.1, or 1.4 ng/mL, with "no ADC" control wells<br>
receiving medium alone. Conditions are in duplicate or triplicate After 3 (PC3) or 4-5 (OVCAR-3) days, 100<br>
uL/well Cell TiterGlo II is added (luciferase-based assay; proliferation measured by ATP levels) and cell<br>
counts are determined using a luminometer. Data are plotted as the mean of luminescence for each set of<br>
replicates, with standard deviation error bars. The protocol is a modification of the CellTiter Glo<br>
Luminiscent Cell Viability Assay (Promega):<br>
1. Plate 1000 cells/ well of PC3/Mucl6 , PC3/ neo (in 50 uL/well) of media. Ovcar3 cells should be<br>
plated at 2000 cells/ well (in 50 uL) of their media, (recipes below) Allow cells to attach overnight.<br>
2. ADC is serially diluted 1:3 in media beginning at at working concentration 18 u,g/ml (this results in a<br>
final concentration of 9 ug/ml). 50 uL of diluted ADC is added to the 50 uL of cells and media already in the<br>
well.<br>
3. Incubate 72-96 hrs (the standard is 72 hours, but watch the 0 ug/mL concentration to stop assay when<br>
the cells are 85-95% confluent).<br>
4. Add 100 uL/well of Promega Cell Titer Glo reagent, shake 3 min. and read on luminometer<br>
Media: PC3/ neo and PC3/MUC16 grow in 50/50/10%FBS/glutamine/250 (ig/mL G-418 OVCAR-3<br>
grow in RPMI/20%FBS/glutamine<br>
Example 10 - Tumor growth inhibition, in vivo efficacy in high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mice<br>
Animals suitable for transgenic experiments can be obtained from standard commercial sources such<br>
as Taconic (Germantown, N.Y.). Many strains are suitable, but FVB female mice are preferred because of<br>
their higher susceptibility to tumor formation. FVB males were used for mating and vasectomized CD.l studs<br>
were used to stimulate pseudopregnancy. Vasectomized mice can be obtained from any commercial supplier.<br>
Founders were bred with either FVB mice or with 129/BL6 x FVB p53 heterozygous mice. The mice with<br>
heterozygosity at p53 allele were used to potentially increase tumor formation. However, this has proven<br>
unnecessary. Therefore, some Fl tumors are of mixed strain. Founder tumors are FVB only. Six founders<br>
were obtained with some developing tumors without having litters.<br>
Animals having tumors (allograft propagated from Fo5 mmtv transgenic mice) were treated with a<br>
single or multiple dose by IV injection of ADC. Tumor volume was assessed at various time points after<br>
injection.<br>
Tumors arise readily in transgenic mice that express a mutationally activated form of neu, the rat<br>
homolog of HER2, but the HER2 that is overexpressed in human breast cancers is not mutated and tumor<br>
formation is much less robust in transgenic mice that overexpress nonmutated HER2 (Webster et al (1994)<br>
Semin. Cancer Biol. 5:69-76).<br>
To improve tumor formation with nonmutated HER2, transgenic mice were produced using a HER2<br>
cDNA plasmid in which an upstream ATG was deleted in order to prevent initiation of translation at such<br>
upstream ATG codons, which would otherwise reduce the frequency of translation initiation from the<br>
downstream authentic initiation codon of HER2 (for example, see Child et al (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274:<br>
24335-24341). Additionally, a chimeric intron was added to the 5' end, which should also enhance the level of<br>
expression as reported earlier (Neuberger and Williams (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:6713; Buchman and<br>
Berg (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:4395; Brinster et al (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:836). The chimeric<br>
intron was derived from a Promega vector, Pci-neo mammalian expression vector (bp 890-1022). The cDNA<br>
3'-end is flanked by human growth hormone exons 4 and 5, and polyadenylation sequences. Moreover, FVB<br>
mice were used because this strain is more susceptible to tumor development. The promoter from MMTVLTR<br>
was used to ensure tissue-specific HER2 expression in the mammary gland. Animals were fed the AIN<br>
76A diet in order to increase susceptibility to tumor formation (Rao et al (1997) Breast Cancer Res. and<br>
Treatment 45:149-158).<br>
Example 11 - Reduction/Oxidation of ThioMabs for Conjugation<br>
Full length, cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in CHO cells were<br>
reduced with about a 50 fold excess of TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999)<br>
Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, MA) for 3 hrs at 37 °C. The reduced ThioMab<br>
(Figure 15) was diluted and loaded onto a HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and eluted with<br>
PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. The eluted reduced ThioMab was treated with 200 nM aqueous<br>
copper sulfate (CuSCM) at room temperature, overnight. Ambient air oxidation was also effective.<br>
Example 12 - Conjugation of ThioMabs<br>
The reoxidized ThioMabs from Example 11, including thio-trastu/umab (A 121C), thio-2H9<br>
(A121C), and thio-3A5 (A121C), were combined with a 10 fold excess of drug-linker intermediate,<br>
BM(PEO)4-DM1, mixed, and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form<br>
the ThioMab antibody-drug conjugates, including thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1, thio-2H9<br>
(A121Q-BMPEO-DM1, and thio-3A5 (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1. The conjugation mixture was gel filtered, or<br>
loaded and eluted through a HiTrap S column to remove excess drug-linker intermediate and other impurities.<br>
