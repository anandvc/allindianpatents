				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel alkyl<br>
ether derivatives or their salts, a process for<br>
production thereof, intermediates thereof and a<br>
therapeutic agent for central and peripheral nerves.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Dementia is divided into cerebrovascular<br>
dementia and neurodegenerative dementia, and various<br>
agents such as cerebral blood flow improvers and<br>
nootropics are used for treating these dementias.<br>
Senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer"s<br>
disease, which is most typical as neurodegenerative<br>
dementia, are mainly composed of amyloid ß protein (Ap)<br>
derived from (3 amyloid precursor protein. Aß is<br>
considered as a substance that is deposited on the<br>
neurons or blood vessels of brain to cause a disease<br>
such as dementia. In addition, it has been reported<br>
that Aß itself injures neurons. Inhibitors of<br>
neurotoxicity induced by Aß are investigated as<br>
therapeutic agents for Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
As compounds having inhibitory activity<br>
against neurotoxicity induced by Aß, there are known,<br>
for example, the 1,2-ethanediol derivatives disclosed<br>
in JP-A-3-232830 and JP-A-4-95070, and the N-<br>
alkoxyalkyl-N,N-dialkylamine derivatives disclosed in<br>
International Publication WO 00/76957.<br>
The 1,2-ethanediol derivatives disclosed in<br>
JP-A-3-232830 and JP-A-4-95070, in particular, (R)-1-<br>
(benzo[b]thiophen-5-yl)-2-[2-(N,N-diethylamino)-<br>
ethoxy]ethanol hydrochloride has protective activity<br>
against the neuronal death caused by Aß (SOCIETY FOR<br>
NEUROSCIENCE, Abstracts, Vol. 24, Part 1, p. 228, 1998)<br>
and activity to enhance the activity of nerve growth<br>
factor (NGF) (WO 96/12717) and hence is useful as a<br>
therapeutic agent for diseases in central and<br>
peripheral nerves. However, there is desired the<br>
development of a compound possessing properties such as<br>
a higher activity to protect neurons and a higher<br>
activity to accelerate nerve regeneration, which are<br>
required as a therapeutic agent for diseases in central<br>
and peripheral nerves.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors earnestly investigated<br>
in order to solve the above problem, and consequently<br>
found that there are compounds having not only calcium-<br>
antagonistic activity but also inhibitory activity<br>
against neurotoxicity induced by A(3, among the alkyl<br>
ether derivatives with calcium-antagonistic activity<br>
disclosed in WO 99/31C56.<br>

Example 9<br>
(a) Production of 1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-<br>
yl)ethoxy]propyl}-3-azetidinol<br>
In 30 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide was dissolved<br>
6.50 g of 5-[2-(3-chloropropoxy)ethyl]-1-<br>
benzothiophene, and to the solution were added 5.60 g<br>
of 3-azetidinol hydrochloride anc 15.3 mL of a 5 mol/L<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, after which the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at 65°C for 3.5 hours.<br>
After the reaction mixture was cooled, water and ethyl<br>
acetate were added thereto and the pH was adjusted to 1<br>
with 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous layer<br>
was separated. Ethyl acetate was added to the aqueous<br>
layer and the pH was adjusted to 10 with a 5 mol/L<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, after which the<br>
organic layer was separated. The organic layer was<br>
washed with water and then a saturated aqueous sodium<br>
chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium<br>
sulfate, and then distilled under reduced pressure to<br>
remove the solvent. The residue was purified by a<br>
column chromatography (eluent; chloroform : methanol =<br>
30 : 1 to 10 : 1) to obtain 4.77 g of l-{3-[2-(1-<br>
benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propyl}-3-azetidinol.<br>
(b) Production of 1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-<br>

100 g of 3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propionic<br>
acid, and 0.1 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide was added<br>
thereto, after which 41.8 mL of oxalyl chloride was<br>
added thereto over a period of 10 minutes and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for<br>
1.5 hours. The resulting solution was added dropwise<br>
to a solution of 65.7 g of 3-hydroxyazetidine<br>
hydrochloride and 59.5 g of sodium hydroxide in 600 mL<br>
of water at 10°C, followed by stirring at room<br>
temperature for 1 hour. To the reaction solution were<br>
added 600 mL of water, 500 mL of ethyl acetate and<br>
sodium chloride, and the organic layer was separated.<br>
To the aqueous layer was added 100 mL of ethyl acetate<br>
and the organic layer was separated. The organic<br>
layers thus obtained were combined. To the combined<br>
organic layer was added 100 mL of water and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 3.5 with 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid, after<br>
which the organic layer was separated. The organic<br>
layer was concentrated to a volume of about 200 mL,<br>
washed with a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen-<br>
carbonate solution and then a saturated aqueous sodium<br>
chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium<br>
sulfate, and then distilled under reduced pressure to<br>
remove the solvent. To the residue was added 300 mL of<br>
toluene, and the resulting mixture was heated at 50°C to<br>
effect dissolution, after which seed crystals were<br>
added at 40°C and the resulting mixture was slowly<br>
cooled and then stirred under ice-cooling for 30<br>
minutes. The crystals precipitated were collected by<br>

yl)ethoxy]-1-(3-hydroxy-l-azetid nyl)-1-propanone as<br>
light-brown crystals.<br>
(2) In 60 mL of tetrahydrofuran was dissolved<br>
30.0 g of 3-[2-(l-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]-1-(3-<br>
hydroxy-1-azetidinyl)-1-propanone, followed by adding<br>
dropwise thereto 275 mL of a 1 mol/L solution of a<br>
borane-tetrahydrofuran complex in tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 5 hours. To the reaction solution was added<br>
dropwise 81.9 mL of 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid, and the<br>
resulting mixture was refluxed for 1.5 hours. After<br>
cooling, the solvent was concentrated to be reduced by<br>
about 290 mL, and the insoluble materials were filtered<br>
off. To the filtrate were added 120 mL of water and 60<br>
mL of toluene, and the aqueous layer was separated and<br>
then washed with 60 mL of toluene. To the aqueous<br>
layer was added 90 mL of ethyl acetate, and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 9.5 with a 5 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, after which the organic layer was separated.<br>
The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under<br>
reduced pressure and 5.35 g of fumaric acid and 54 mL<br>
of ethanol were added to the resulting residue. The<br>
resulting mixture was heated at 74°C to effect<br>
dissolution, and then 161 mL of ethyl acetate was added<br>
dropwise thereto. The mixture thus obtained was slowly<br>
cooled and then stirred at 5 to 10°C for 30 minutes, and<br>
the crystals precipitated were collected by filtration<br>
to obtain 22.7 g of 1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-<br>
yl)ethoxy]propyl}-3-azetidinol 1/2 fumarate as light-<br>

[Activity to accelerate neurite outgrowth]<br>
PC12 cells [rat adrenomedullary chromaffinoma<br>
(NGF responders)] were cultured in an incubator (5% CO2,<br>
37°C) by using RPMI1640 medium (available from Nissui<br>
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) containing 5% heat<br>
inactivated (56°C, 30 minutes) horse serum (available<br>
from Bio-Whittaker Inc.), 5% heat inactivated (56°C, 30<br>
minutes) fetal calf serum (available from Sigma<br>
Chemical Co.) and 25 µg/ml gemamicin (available from<br>
GIBCO BRL).<br>
The cultured PC12 cells were incubated at 37°C<br>
for 30 minutes in phosphate-buffered physiological<br>
saline containing 1 mM EDTA, to be detached from a<br>
culture flask. The concentration of the cultured PC12<br>
cells was adjusted to 5 x 104 cells/mL with RPMI1640<br>
medium containing 1.5% heat inactivated horse serum,<br>
1.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and 25 µg/ml<br>
gentamicin, and the resulting cell suspension was<br>
dispensed in 2 ml portions into 35-mm tissue culture<br>
dishes (mfd. by Falcon Inc.) coated with 0.01%<br>
polyornithine [dissolved in 150 mM borate buffer (pH<br>
8.4)]. Then, 2.5s-NGF (available from Wako Pure<br>
Chemical Industries, Ltd.) [dissolved in phosphate-<br>
buffered physiological saline containing 0.1% bovine<br>
serum albumin] and each test compound were added to the<br>
medium at the same time so as to adjust their final<br>
concentrations to 40 ng/mL and 10 µM, respectively,<br>
followed by culturing under conditions of 5% CO2 and<br>
37°C. After 48 hours of the culturing, cells were fixed<br>
in a 10% neutral formalin solution for 30 minutes,<br>
washed with phosphate-buffered physiological saline and<br>
distilled water, and then dried. Any four fields of<br>
view were selected under a phase contrast microscope,<br>
and 50 or more cells were observed in each field of<br>
view. The percentage of the number of cells having an<br>
neutrite extended to a length longer than the diameter<br>
of the cell body relative to the total number of cells<br>
observed (neutrite outgrowth rate) was calculated.<br>
The activity to accelerate neutrite outgrowth<br>
was calculated according to the following expression as<br>
a neutrite outgrowth acceleration rate attained by the<br>
addition of each test compound, by taking a neutrite<br>
outgrowth rate due to NGF as 100%:<br>
(neutrite outgrowth rate attained by addition<br>
of each test compound) / (neutrite outgrowth rate due<br>
to NGF) x 100 (%)<br>
As a result, the neutrite outgrowth<br>
acceleration rate was found to be as follows: the<br>
compound of Example 2: 2 65%, the compound of Example 6:<br>
300%, the compound of Example 12: 299%, the compound of<br>

[Activity to accelerate nerve regeneration]<br>
The test was carried out according to the<br>
method described in J. Pharmaco. Exp. Ther., Vol. 290,<br>
page 348 (1999) and Neuroscience, vol. 88, page 257<br>
(1999).<br>
SD strain rats (male, aged 6 to 7 weeks, and<br>
weighing 170 to 280 g) were anesthetized with<br>
pentobarbital, and the left sciatic nerve of each rat<br>
was exposed in the femoral region, separated from the<br>
surrounding connective tissue, and then cut at a distal<br>
position which was about 1 cm apart from the gluteus.<br>
The ends of the nerve were inserted into a sterilized<br>
silicone tube with a length of 8 mm (inside diameter<br>
1.3 mm, and outside diameter 1.8mm) to a depth of 3.5<br>
mm so that a space of 1 mm might be formed in the<br>
middle of the tube. The ends of the nerve were fixed<br>
and the nerve was put back to the muscular tissue<br>
together with the tube, after which the incised part<br>
was sutured. On the seventh day, each test compound<br>
dissolved in distilled water was orally administered in<br>
a dose of 1 mg/kg, and thereafter the test compound was<br>
administered once a day for 13 days in the same manner<br>
as above.<br>
Twenty-one days after cutting the nerve, the<br>
sciatic nerve was exposed again under pentobarbital<br>
anesthesia, and the nerve in the femoral region and the<br>
crural region was separated from the surrounding<br>
connective tissues, after which the silicone tube at<br>
the cut part was removed. A stimulation electrode was<br>
set on the proximal side with respect to the cut<br>
position, and a recording electrode was set at the most<br>
distal position in the crural region. An electric<br>
stimulus (voltage: 2 V, delay: 1 msec, and duration:<br>
100 fisec) was given, and an action potential induced by<br>
the stimulus was recorded. The recording electrode was<br>
gradually moved toward the proximal, and the distance<br>
between the cut position and the most distal position<br>
at which an action potential had been obtained was<br>
measured as regeneration distance. Only distilled<br>
water was administered to a control group.<br>
The sciatic nerve regeneration rate of the<br>
test compound was calculated according to the following<br>
expression:<br>
(regeneration distance of drug-treated group)<br>
(regeneration distance of control group) x 100 (%)<br>
As a result, the sciatic nerve regeneration<br>
rate was found to be as follows: the compound of<br>
Example 4: 167%, the compound of Example 10: 186%, the<br>
compound of Example 12: 142%, the compound of Example<br>
14: 150%, the compound of Example 31: 155%, and the<br>
compound of Example 33: 161%.<br>

[Activity to inhibit the neuronal death induced by Aß]<br>
Inhibitory effect on the death of cultured<br>
neurons induced by Aß was investigated by modifying the<br>
method described in Brain Res., vol. 639, page 240<br>
(1994) .<br>
Cerebral cortices isolated from the brains of<br>
embryos (aged 17 to 19 days) of Wistar strain rats were<br>
sliced, and then neurons were dissociated by trypsin<br>
treatment. The cells were seeded into a 48-well tissue<br>
culture plate at a density of 1 x 105 cells per well and<br>
cultured under conditions of 5% CO2, and 37°C on<br>
Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium added B27 supplement<br>
(available from GIBCO BRL) and 3.6 mg/mL glucose.<br>
On the 12th to 13th day of the culture, a<br>
potassium chloride solution was added to the medium to<br>
adjust the final concentration of potassium chloride to<br>
25 mmol/L. Immediately after this addition, each test<br>
compound was added to the medium. After 24 hours, Aß<br>
(a peptides comprising 25 to 35 residues) dissolved in<br>
distilled water was added to the medium at a final<br>
concentration of 20 µmol/L. After another 24 hours,<br>
the medium was replaced with Dulbecco"s modified<br>
Eagle"s medium added B27 supplement and 3.6 mg/mL<br>
glucose and test compound.<br>
The inhibitory activity of the test compound<br>
against the death of cultured neurons was determined by<br>
inhibition against the decrease of reducing ability of<br>
MMT. That is, MTT assay [J. Immuno. Methods, vol. 65,<br>
page 55 (1983)] developed by Mosmann was carried out 48<br>
hours after the medium replacement, and the inhibition<br>
rate (%) of the test compound against a decrease of a<br>
MTT assay value induced by A(3 was calculated.<br>
Inhibition rate = [(MTT assay value of a<br>
group treated with Aß and the drug) - (MTT assay value<br>
of a group treated with Aß)] / [MTT assay value of an<br>
untreated group - MTT assay value of a group treated<br>
with Aß] x 100 (%).<br>
As a result, the inhibition rate at a<br>
concentration of 1 µM was found to be as follows: the<br>
compound of Example 4: 63%, the compound of Example 6:<br>
48%, the compound of Example 10: 42%, the compound of<br>
Example 14: 48%, the compound of Example 31: 50%, the<br>
compound of Example 33: 54%, the compound of Example<br>
61: 52%, the compound of Example 69: 70%, the compound<br>
of Example 74: 50%, and the compound of Example 80:<br>
75%.<br>

[Metabolism in human liver microsomes]<br>
In a test tube were placed 50 µL of 100<br>
mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 25 µL of<br>
3 mg protein/mL pooled human liver microsomes<br>
(available from Gentest Inc.), and a solution prepared<br>
by blending 10 µL of 66 mmol/L sodium glucose 6-<br>
phosphate, 10 µL of 10 units/mL glucose 6-phosphate<br>
dehydrogenase, 10 µL of 26 mmol/L nicotinamide adenine<br>
dinucleotide phosphate oxidized form, 10 )µL of 66<br>
mmol/L magnesium chloride and 135 µL of 100 mmol/L<br>
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added thereto,<br>
followed by preincubation for 5 minutes. Thereto was<br>
added 50 µL of each test compound to a concentration of<br>
6 µmol/L to initiate the reaction, and incubation was<br>
carried out at 37°C for 60 minutes (final volume:<br>
300 µL). The reaction was terminated by the addition<br>
of 600 µL of acetonitrile, followed by centrifugation<br>
at 12000 x g and at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant<br>
was separated, concentrated by centrifugation under<br>
reduced pressure, and then subjected to high<br>
performance liquid chromatography, and the amount of<br>
the residual test compound after the metabolic reaction<br>
was determined.<br>
The residual rate was calculated by the<br>
following equation:<br>
Residual rate (%) = [(peak area due to the<br>
test compound after 60 minutes of the reaction) / (peak<br>
area due to the test compound in the case of stopping<br>
the reaction by adding acetonitrile simultaneously with<br>
the addition of the test compound after the<br>
preincubation)] x 100<br>
As a result, the residual rate was found to<br>
be as follows: the compound of Example 4: 80%, the<br>
compound of Example 10: 70%, the compound of Example<br>
12: 83%, the compound of Example 14: 75%, the compound<br>
of Example 61: 74%, the compound of Example 69: 74%,<br>
the compound of Example 71: 80%, and the compound of<br>
Example 74: 71%.<br>
