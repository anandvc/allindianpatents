Description<br>
INFORMATION DEVICE, PREFERABLY IN A MOTOR VEHICLE, AND METHOD<br>
FOR [SUPPLYING] INFORMATION ABOUT VEHICLE DATA, IN PARTICULAR<br>
VEHICLE FUNCTIONS AND THEIR OPERATION<br>
The present invention relates to an information device, preferably in a motor vehicle, having at least one output device and a processing device to which a memory device is assigned, in which vehicle data, in particular data regarding vehicle functions and/or vehicle elements, their function and/or operation and/or manipulation, and/or data of vehicle states and/or their change are stored, and it relates to a method for [supplying] information about vehicle data, in particular vehicle functions and/or vehicle elements and their operation, function and/or manipulation, with the aid of an output device.<br>
In vehicles according to the related art, all technical features of the motor vehicle and its particular equipment with which the operator should be familiar are generally included in a manual or log book that is provided in printed form. By now, most vehicles are actually equipped with various diagnostic systems for problem detection, both with regard to the state of vehicle components and with regard to critical driving or driver situations. Nevertheless, the problems detected by a diagnostic system prior to or during driving for the most part are indicated to the operator merely with the aid of signal lamps or lit symbols or also by brief text messages or pictograms. The information transmitted in this manner indicates a particular problem with the vehicle; to remedy the problem, it is usually necessary to consult a manual, a printed copy of which is stored in the glove compartment, for instance. The manual is typically<br><br>
utilized only when the driver encounters a problem with the vehicle or its operation. The use of the manual is generally perceived as time-consuming, complex and quite cumbersome since many users dislike reading longer printed texts and, in particular, find comprehensive technical contents rather daunting.<br>
WO 01/27704 Al describes a method for preparing documents or information for a technical product that can be produced in series and on the assembly line; a product book is produced directly on the assembly line during the production process. The product book includes the essential technical features of the product, notes the suggestions relevant to the use and/or operation of the product, and lists the individual equipment particulars that are characteristic of the specific product item, the product book being specially assigned to this product and geared toward it. The product book can also be prepared as EDP data set. The goal of this method is the preparation of a product book which is easy to understand and provides useful information while avoiding unnecessary stock-keeping and reducing the expense to a minimum; the product book should dispense with superfluous information as much as possible yet still cover the individual special equipment of a product. However, the method provides no help when problems arise during use, and the user, through his own research endeavors, must first consult the product book on his own in order to locate and identify information therein that is relevant to the existing problem, then absorb and analyze this information and interpret it using his own level of experience, only to be forced then to decide which measures to take to solve the problem. Even if a readily comprehensible product book is available, this approach provides little comfort, is complex and time-consuming, and,<br><br>
Mi<br>
furthermore, bears the inherent risk that the user will arrive at faulty conclusions and decisions.<br>
DE 19941973 Al describes a method and a device for actively assisting a motor vehicle driver with the aid of at least one control device and an in[put] and display unit. The control device has access to the data of sensors and control devices and/or comfort control devices and/or internal or external data bases relevant to the vehicle state, thereby providing automatic assistance in the communication between the vehicle driver and the vehicle system. The control device, in particular, detects a critical vehicle state by evaluating the data of the vehicle-relevant sensors and control devices, whereupon a list of possible actions on the part of the vehicle driver in response to the detected critical vehicle state is prepared, the detected critical vehicle state and the possible actions by the vehicle driver are displayed on the display unit, and an action selected by the vehicle driver is carried out by the control device. However, the information offered by the system is always displayed only as text in the form of lists. No modification of the type of information output is provided. Furthermore, since the described system is not an information device but a system for active assistance by automatic execution of actions with the aid of a control device, this system is also not suitable for providing the user with the greatest possible amount of information about vehicle-internal processes or technical details and for explaining to him the implementation of possible measures in the most comprehensible fashion possible.<br>
In addition, DE 10 2005 002 277 Al provides an information system for a vehicle having a data-processing device and a display device for displaying stored information, which is selectable with the aid of an operating device, the information<br><br>
involving information of an electronic advice manual. Individual chapters of the advice manual are selectable via the operating device for display by the display device. Among other things, the electronic advice manual can include instructions for responding in an emergency, e.g., a breakdown, as well as instructions regarding first-aid measures.<br>
The present invention is based on the technical objective of providing a device for displaying information about vehicle functions, and a method for [supplying] information about vehicle data, especially vehicle functions as well as their operation and display, with whose aid a user is able to learn the operation and manipulation of the vehicle functions and the function of operating devices and operating elements in an uncomplicated manner.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of Claims 1 and 12. Advantageous developments and further refinements are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention, vehicle data, in particular vehicle functions and their operation and manipulation, e.g., via operating devices assigned to the vehicle functions, and/or vehicle elements and/or their function and/or manipulation, and/or vehicle states and/or their variations, are displayed in animated fashion on an output device realized as display device. This is preferably implemented by visually displaying, for instance, the operating devices or vehicle elements or vehicle states in their setup in the motor vehicle on the display device. According to the present invention, the operation of the operating devices, possibly together with their effect on the vehicle function, the manipulation of the vehicle elements and possibly their movement during the manipulation, and/or the<br><br>
change in the vehicle states is displayed in animated fashion on the display device. Thus, the user is offered an easily comprehensible display of the functions and the vehicle elements, which helps him use them correctly.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the visual and acoustical explanation of the vehicle functions, their operation and/or manipulation, and/or the vehicle elements, possibly together with their manipulation, and/or of the vehicle states is implemented with the aid of an animated display of an artificial person, which is generally known as avatar, on the display device; appropriate acoustic supplementation is provided via voice output. The avatar is preferably designed in such a way that the visual and acoustic explanations are supplemented by corresponding motions of the avatar. In other words, the avatar moderates the information playback. In this way the user obtains the appropriate information in a manner that is even more comprehensible and easier to absorb.<br>
According to another specific embodiment of the present invention, the operating device assigned to the vehicle function currently to be explained, possibly an associated display on the display device, and/or a vehicle element currently to be explained are/is displayed on the display device in an optically highlighted or optically variable manner for better visualization.<br>
In addition to the display of the operating device of the vehicle function currently to be explained, and/or the vehicle element in the static state, it is possible to display the operating device in its operating movement and the vehicle element in its operating movement for better exemplification.<br><br>
According to another specific embodiment of the present invention, the operating element of the vehicle function currently to be explained, or the vehicle element currently to be explained is displayed on the display device in a different size as a function of the current information output. For instance, if the user is to be informed about the location of the operating element or the vehicle element in the vehicle, then the display of the operating element or the vehicle element on the display device is implemented within the context of the other operating elements or vehicle components, and its display on the display device is relatively small. If the operating element or the vehicle element is to be explained as such or in its function, then it may be zoomed out of the overall context and displayed at a correspondingly larger size in comparison with the detail information.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the at least one output device designed as display device is part of what is generally known as a multi-function operating device in the vehicle, which is used, among others, to operate audio devices or a navigation system installed in the vehicle. The information playback may then be called up as help menu, preferably with the aid of an operating device of the multi¬function operating device.<br>
In the following text, the present invention is explained on the basis of exemplary embodiments. The associated figures show:<br>
Figure 1   a schematic representation of the information device using a multi-function operating device,<br>
Figure 2   a display of a main menu on the display device for calling up information about functionalities of the motor vehicle,<br><br>
Fig. 3a to 3g a method sequence to explain a cruise control<br>
system, Fig. 4a to 4e a method sequence for installing a removable<br>
trailer device.<br>
The information device according to the present invention for explaining and in assisting in the driving and operation of motor vehicles according to Figure 1 includes a processing device 3 and a memory 4 connected thereto or integrated therein. Vehicle data, in particular data of vehicle functions, their operating devices and displays, as well as data of vehicle elements and components and also their function or manipulation, and/or vehicle states and their variations are stored in the memory. Vehicle functions may be, for example, the function and operation of driver-assistance systems, navigation systems or electric window raisers. Vehicle elements are to be understood as, e.g., a seat and/or its de-installation sequence or the installation of a removable trailer device. Memory 4 may essentially include all of the information that is generally also part of a known operating manual these days, even if this information is provided in different form. In the exemplary embodiment, processing device 3 is connected to a multi-function operating device 1 or integrated therein, which is disposed in the vehicle, e.g., in the center console. One such multi¬function operating device is known from DE 199 41 969 Al, for instance. Other specific embodiments of multi-function operating devices are conceivable, among them also a device developed as touch screen. Via a menu structure, multi-function operating device 1 enables the operation of different electronic devices of the motor vehicle, e.g., a navigation system or audio systems, and applications. In the exemplary embodiment, an operating element 2a of operating device 2 is provided, which is used to call up a help menu 16 according to Figure 2. Vehicle<br><br>
functions, vehicle elements, and/or vehicle states about which the user wishes to receive information, such as with regard to their use, display in the vehicle or their manipulation, are selectable via this help menu 16. In the exemplary embodiment, these are mobile telephone 30, cruise control system 31, the manipulation of detachable trailer device 32, automatic distance controller 33, the operation of the memory function for driver seat and outside mirror 34, and air conditioning system 35. However, the call-up of other and additional functionalities, as well as the function and selection of the electronic devices and applications that are able to be operated with the aid of the multi-function operating device, e.g., the navigation device, may be provided as well. If a larger number of explicable functions and vehicle elements is involved, then the functions and vehicle elements may be combined into groups in the main menu. After selecting a function group, the individual function may then be selected in a submenu. The selection of the particular functionalities in the exemplary embodiment takes place via press/turn element 6 or operating elements 2 designed as soft keys. If a touch screen is used, then the selection is made by touching the particular touch screen operating element.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the information sequence to explain the cruise control system following its selection, with the aid of a film displayed on display device 5, in which avatar 15 provides explanatory support by hand and body motions as well as voice output. After the selection, the image from Fig. 3a appears. Avatar 15, using hand and body motions and speech output via acoustic output device 7 (Fig. 1), states: "I will show you how to operate the electronic cruise control system, abbreviated CCS". Fig. 3a shows the cockpit of the vehicle with all its display and operating devices. Operating device 8 of the cruise control system together with all its operating elements is<br><br>
highlighted in color. This is followed by the display image of Fig. 3b. In comparison with the representation in Fig. 3a, operating device 8 is brought closer by zooming and takes up the greatest part of the display surface; here too, it is shown highlighted in color in comparison with the background. Avatar 15 offers information about the function of the cruise control system: "The cruise control system constantly maintains a set speed between 30 and 210 k/h." Avatar 15 then provides information about the activation of the cruise control system. "Pull this lever in the direction of the steering wheel until it engages". In the film, operating device 8 moves in the direction of the user. Fig. 3c, which displays a detail of the instrument cluster including the speed display and symbol 9, is displayed in the film sequence. Avatar 15 indicates by a hand movement and the speech output: "After activation, this symbol appears on the instrument cluster".  Avatar 15 then goes on to explain how to set and store the desired speed: "Drive at the desired speed and press the set key on the side of the lever". For better visibility, set key 10 is highlighted in contrast to the rest of the operating device (Fig. 3d). After the speed has been set, avatar 15 explains the option of increasing or decreasing the stored speed in a similar manner. Fig. 3e - 3g are utilized to illustrate the manner in which the temporary deactivation of the cruise control system is explained with the aid of avatar 15. In the figures, the particular operating element - brake pedal 11, clutch pedal 12 or operating lever 8 -, which may be used for the deactivation, is highlighted in comparison to the background. In addition, the explanation of the operating function is supplemented by the movement and the speech output of avatar 15. "Depress the brake pedal; in vehicles with a manual transmission, depress the clutch pedal or press the operating lever slightly away from the steering wheel. To reactivate the cruise control system, release the brake pedal or<br><br>
the clutch pedal and lightly pull the operating lever toward the steering wheel".<br>
Fig. 4 shows the animated sequence to explain the installation of the detachable trailer device with the aid of several fixed images.  At the beginning, avatar 15 explains: "The detachable trailer device is located underneath the trunk floor with the onboard tools. I will show you how to install and uninstall the trailer device. Remove the cover underneath the rear shock absorber by rotating both quick-release closures by 90 degrees". A portion of the rear shock absorber together with cover 20 is shown on the display device. Cover 20 is highlighted against the shock absorber using color. In addition, quick release closures 21 are displayed, which in turn are highlighted against the cover using color for easy visibility. The film shows the manner and direction in which rapid release closures 21 must be turned in order to allow the removal of the cover. Using hand and body motions, avatar 15 points to cover 20 and the quick release closures. Next, the installation of the trailer device on the trailer connector plug is explained. Fig. 4b shows the storage compartment with the trailer connector plug as part of the installation sequence. Aided by its hand and body motions, avatar 15 explains: "Rotate the trailer connector plug sideways as far as it will go, which will provide access to the receptacle for the ball head". With the aid of a selective motion of avatar 15, the display device displays the rotational movement of trailer connector plug 22 from its original position in Fig. 4b to the rotated position in Fig. 4c. "Check whether the receptacle, the hand-wheel, the shaft and the locking balls of the trailer device are clean and undamaged". Using color, hand-wheel 23, shaft 24 and locking balls 25 are highlighted one after the other within the context of the corresponding speech output of avatar 15. Avatar 15 goes on: "The trailer device can<br><br>
be properly mounted only if the coupling device is prestressed. You prestress the coupling device by pulling out the hand-wheel using the right hand (the hand-wheel 23a, shown in enlarged size, is highlighted again using color (Fig. 4d)), retain it in this position, and turn the hand-wheel in the direction of the arrow. Now the ball head is prestressed. This is the way to mount the trailer device (Fig. 4e). Guide the prestressed trailer device into the receptacle, push the trailer device forcefully in the upward direction until it engages. (Here, too, trailer device 26 is highlighted using color; trailer device 26 changes color again once the engagement has been demonstrated). Then it must be checked whether the trailer device was installed correctly. Turn the key to the left, remove it, and place the cover on top".<br><br>
