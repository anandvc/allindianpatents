				<td>The present invention relates to a composition comprising at least one fungicidal compound having anilinopyrimidines and imazalil.<br>
The present invention relates to a fungicidal composition comprising at least one fungicidal compound of the family of anilinopyrimidines and imazalil, and the use of such a composition combining these active compounds for controlling plant diseases or the phytopathogenic fungi present or capable of appearing on plants.<br>
Fungicidal compounds of the family of anilinopyrimidines are known from the literature and in particular from the book entitled The Electronic Pesticide Manual version 1.1 (by British Crop Protection Council, published by Clive Tomlin); this book also describes imazalil for its fungicidal properties.<br>
Moreover, French Patent Application No. 2 692 108 which essentially relates to mixtures based on pyrimethanil and numerous other compounds gives a list of more than eleven types of families of fungicidal compounds and of more than 70 candidate compounds for the mixture; among this systematic list of compounds, only 23 mixtures have led to laboratory experimentation, none under open field conditions. Thus, even if the pyrimethanil and imazalil mixture is mentioned by this document, this mixture was not prepared and even less tested.<br>
However, it is still desirable to improve the products which can be used by the farmer for controlling fungicidal diseases of plants and in particular of crops.<br>
It is also still desirable to improve the fungicidal products used for treating fruit.<br>
In addition, while imazalil may be used as a preventive and curative treatment, this curative effect remains limited overtime.<br><br><br>
It is also still desirable to reduce the doses of chemical products applied to plants or fruit, in particular by reducing the applied doses of the products.<br>
It is finally still desirable to increase the range of available antifungal products in order to find among them those best suited to specific uses.<br>
It is also still advantageous to have antifungal means of treating fruit, in particular after harvest, and which can be reused or recycled during their application.<br>
Likewise, it is very advantageous to have a mean of protecting fruit during their preservation, their storage, their transport and up to their marketing or their consumption.<br>
It has also become essential to be able to have antifungal means of treatment which limit or avoid phenomena of resistance of phytopathogenic organisms.<br>
It is also advantageous to have such products which have the broadest possible activity spectrum.<br>
To the numerous problems which have just been disclosed, there are added most often those linked to the protection of the environment, environmental problems to which the users of fungicidal active ingredients, as well as consumers of products obtained from these crops, are increasingly sensitive.<br>
Another difficulty relating to the use of numerous fungicidal substances lies in the accumulation of several of the problems which have just been disclosed. It is indeed even more difficult to solve the problems posed when they accumulate because the solutions which can be envisaged are sometimes antinomical or even antagonistic.<br><br>
A first object of the present invention consists in providing fungicidal compositions possessing a broad activity spectrum, that is to say possessing a substantial activity on a larger number of phytopathogenic fungi than the number of phytopathogenic fungi treated with known compositions.<br>
A second object of the invention consists in providing fungicidal compositions possessing both a preventive effect and a curative effect, in particular an improved curative effect compared with the fungicidal compositions currently used.<br>
Another object of the present invention consists in providing fungicidal compositions which can effectively control fungal strains resistant to known fungicidal compositions.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide fungicidal compositions which are effective at significantly lower doses compared with the doses currently applied.<br>
Another object of the present invention consists in providing fungicidal compositions.<br>
Another object of the present invention consists in providing a fungicidal composition possessing preventive, curative, eradicant and antisporulant properties.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition useful to control plant phytopathogenic organisms after harvest, notably on fruit.<br>
Other objects of the invention will appear in the disclosure of the invention which is presented in the remainder of the present description.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that all of these objects may be achieved completely or in part using the fungicidal compositions which are the subject of the present invention.<br><br>
The present invention also proposes achieving all or some of the objectives which have just been mentioned.<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising at least one fungicidal compound of the family of anilinopyrimidines and imazalil.<br>
Among the anilinopyrimidine-type fungicidal compounds, those advantageously suitable for the composition according to the invention are cyprodinil, mepanipyrim and pyrimethanil.<br>
The preferred combination of active ingredients according to the present invention is the association of pyrimethanil and imazalil.<br>
References to methods for preparing such anilinopyrimidine compounds and imazalil will be found in the book cited above.<br>
In the composition according to the invention, the ratio of the quantities of compound of the family of anilinopyrimidines and imazalil generally ranges from 0.0005 to 250, preferably from 0.05 to 10.<br>
However, the ratio of these compounds ranging from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.15 to 6, still more preferably from 0.25 to 4, have proved even more advantageous.<br>
Usually, the compositions according to the invention comprise between 0.00001 and 100%, preferably between 0.001 and 80%, of active compounds, whether these compounds are combined, or whether they are in the form of two active ingredients used separately.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the proportions and percentages used or described throughout the present description and in the claims which will follow are proportions or percentages by weight.<br>
For their use in practice, the active substances of the composition according to the invention are rarely used alone.<br><br>
Thus, for their use, these active ingredients are usually combined with a solid or liquid carrier which can be used in particular in the agricultural field, and optionally with at least one surfactant and/or one or more auxiliary agents.<br>
In particular, as carriers, there may be used inert and customary carriers; likewise, as surfactant, there may be used the customary surfactants in the field of formulation of compositions, which are intended for agricultural use, in particular for the treatment or protection of crops such as those of the present invention.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the various fungicidal compositions according to the invention which have been described up until now may also be in the form of tank mixes.<br>
These fungicidal compositions in the form of tank mixes are usually in the form of dilute fungicidal compositions.<br>
Most often, these so-called tank mix fungicidal compositions are mixed in the reservoir of the application device.<br>
Usually, the fungicidal compounds used in the compositions according to the invention are therefore combined with one or more carriers and/or one or more substances useful for their formulation. Thus, where appropriate, the compositions according to the invention may comprise up to 99% of carrier and/or up to 25% of one or more surfactants and/or up to 25% of one or more formulating agents.<br>
In the present disclosure, the term carrier designates a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active ingredient(s) are in the compositions according to the invention, in particular to facilitate their application to a plant, a fruit or alternatively to seeds or to the soil.<br><br>
This carrier is therefore generally inert and should most often be acceptable in agriculture, in particular by the treated plant or by the fruit of this plant in the broad sense.<br>
As examples of solid carriers which can be used, there may be mentioned natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes, fine powders or granules of clay, in particular kaolinic clay, diatomaceous earth, bentonite or acidic clay, synthetic silicon oxide hydrate, talcs, ceramics, other minerals including sericite, quartz, sulphur, activated charcoal, calcium carbonate, hydrated silica, or alternatively industrial fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, urea or ammonium chloride.<br>
As examples of liquid carriers which can be used, there may be mentioned water, alcohols and in particular methanol or ethanol, ketones and in particular acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or cyclohexanone, petroleum fractions, aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene or methylnaphthalene, nonaromatic hydrocarbons including hexane, cyclohexane, kerosene or gas oil, liquefied gas, esters including ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, nitriles including acetonitrile and isobutyronitrile, ethers including diisopropyl ether or dioxane, amides including N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide, halogenated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, trichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride, dimethyl sulphoxide, vegetable oils including soybean oil or cottonseed oil.<br>
The surfactant(s) may be emulsifying, dispersing or wetting agents of the ionic or nonionic type.<br>
It is possible, for example, to mention salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols, in particular alkylphenols or<br><br>
arylphenols, salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, derivatives of taurine, in particular alkyl taurates, phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols; it is also possible to mention most particularly alkyl sulphonate salts, alkylaryl sulphonates, alkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylenic derivatives thereof, polyethylene glycol ethers, polyalcohol esters, derivatives of sugars, alcohols and the like.<br>
The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when at least one of the active ingredients and/or the inert carrier are not soluble, in particular in water, in the case where the carrier agent for the application is water.<br>
In the compositions according to the invention, it is also possible to combine with the active compounds all sorts of other ingredients or agents such as, for example, protective colloids, adhesives, thickening agents, thixotropic agents, penetrating agents, stabilizing agents including isopropyl hydrogen phosphate, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol and 3-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol, vegetable or mineral oils, fatty acids or esters thereof, sequestering agents, dispersing agents including casein, gelatin, saccharides and in particular starch powder, gum arabic, certain derivatives of cellulose or alginic acid, derivatives of lignin, bentonite, synthetic polymers soluble in water, in particular polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acids, and the like, as well as other active ingredients known for their pesticidal, in particular insecticidal or fungicidal, properties; or for their plant growth promoting properties, in particular fertilizers; or for their insect or plant growth regulating properties.<br>
Thus, the fungicidal compositions according to the invention may take fairly diverse forms, in particular they may be in solid or liquid forms.<br><br>
More generally, the compositions according to the invention may take numerous forms of formulations; thus, these compositions comprising the active  compounds  may be  used  in  the form  of an  aerosol dispenser; suspension   of   capsules;   cold   fogging   concentrate;   dustable   powder; emulsifiable concentrate; aqueous/aqueous type emulsion; oil/inverse type emulsion; encapsulated granule; fine granule; suspension concentrate for seed treatment; compressed gas; gas generating product; granule;  hot fogging concentrate; macrogranule; microgranule; oil-dispersible powder, oil miscible suspension concentrate; oil-miscible liquid; paste; plant rodlet; powder for dry seed treatment; seed coated with a pesticide; smoke candle; smoke cartridge; smoke generator; smoke pellet; smoke rodlet; smoke tablet; smoke tin; soluble concentrate;   soluble   powder;   solution   for   seed   treatment;   suspension concentrate (- flowable concentrate); tracking powder; ultra low volume liquid; ultra low volume suspension;  vapour releasing  product;  water-dispersible granules or tablets; water dispersible powder for slurry treatment; water-soluble granules or tablets; water-soluble powder for seed treatment; wettable powder; as well as possible mixtures, associations or combinations of these various forms.<br>
Most often, for dustable powder or dispersion type formulations, the content of active compounds may be up to 100%; likewise, for formulations in the form of granules, in particular those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular support, or granulation using a powder, the content of fungicidal compounds in these granules according to the invention is most often between 0.5 and 80%.<br>
The fungicidal compositions according to the invention, which are termed concentrated compositions, comprise the active compounds in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates, comprise most often from 25 to 100% of<br><br>
these active ingredients; the emulsions or solutions ready for application containing, for their part, from 0.00001 to 20% of active ingredients.<br>
It goes without saying that the expression active ingredients should be understood throughout the present disclosure as, where appropriate, an active ingredient or a fungicidal compound alone, but also a combination of these two active ingredients.<br>
In addition to the solvent, the emulsifiable concentrates may contain, when necessary, 2 to 20% of appropriate additives such as stabilizing agents, surfactants, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colouring agents or adhesives mentioned above.<br>
The compositions according to the invention in the form of suspension concentrates, which can also be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to obtain a stable, fluid product which does not become deposited; they usually contain from 2 to 75% of active ingredients, from 0.5 to 15% of surfactants, from 0.1 to 10% of thixotropic agents, from 0 to 10% of appropriate additives, such as antifoaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizing agents, penetrating agents and adhesives; and, as carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient(s) are sparingly soluble or insoluble, or alternatively mixtures of several of these solvents, organic or otherwise.<br>
Some solid organic substances or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to retard or prevent sedimentation; or alternatively such substances may be used as antifreeze for water.<br>
The fungicidal compositions according to the invention which take the form of wettable powders or flo-dusts are usually prepared so that they contain from 20 to 95% of active ingredients.<br>
Moreover, they usually contain, in addition to a solid carrier, from 0 to 5% of a wetting agent, from 3 to 10% of a dispersing agent, and, where<br><br>
appropriate, from 0 to 10% of one or more stabilizing agents and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, or anticaking agents, colouring agents and the like.<br>
To obtain these flo-dusts or wettable powders, the active ingredient(s) are intimately mixed in appropriate mixers with additional substances, and they are ground with mills or other appropriate grinders. Flo-dusts are then obtained whose wettability and suspension are particularly advantageous; they can be suspended with water at any desired concentration. Rather than wettable powders, it is possible to prepare fungicidal compositions according to the invention which are in the form of pastes.<br>
The conditions and modalities for the preparation and use of these pastes are similar to those of wettable powders or flo-dusts.<br>
As already stated, aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example the fungicidal compositions obtained by diluting with water a wettable powder or an emulsifiable concentrate according to the invention, are included in the general context of the present invention.<br>
The emulsions may be of the water-in-oil or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick or fairly thick consistency.<br>
In addition to the fungicidal compounds of the family of anilinopyrimidines and imazalil, the composition according to the invention may also comprise other active compounds and in particular one or more active compounds useful for protecting plants against pests.<br>
Among such active compounds, the composition according to the invention may therefore comprise one or more insecticidal, herbicidal or fungicidal compounds or growth regulating compounds.<br>
Among the additional insecticidal, acaricidal or nematicidal active ingredients which may be used alone or in combination with other active<br><br>
ingredients,  in  particular pesticides,  in  the  composition  according  to the invention, there may be mentioned abamectin; acephate; acetamiprid; oleic acid; acrinathrin; aldicarb; alanycarb; allethrin [(1r)-isomers]; a-cypermethrin; amitraz; azadirachtin; azamethiphos; azinphos-ethyl; azinphos-methyl; bacillus thurigiensi;    bendiocarb;    benfuracarb;;    bensultap;    beta-cyfluthrin;    beta-cypermethrin;   bifenthrin;   bioallathrin;   bioallethrin   (isomer  s-cyclopentenyl); bioresmethrin;  borax; buprofezin;  butocarboxim;  butoxycarboxim; piperonyl butoxide;   cadusafos;   carbaryl;   carbofuran;   carbosulphan;   cartap;   cartap hydrochloride;    chlordane;    chlorethoxyfos;    chlorfenapyr;    chlorfenvinphos; chlorfluazuron;   chlormephos;   chloropicrin;   chlorpyrifos;   chlorpyrifos-methyl; mercury(l) chloride; coumaphos;  cryolite; cryomazine;  cyanophos;  calcium cyanide; sodium cyanide; cycloprothrin; cyfluthrin; cyhalothrin; cypermethrin; cyphenothrin   [(Ir)-trans-isomers];   dazomet;   ddt;   deltamethrin;   demeton-s-methyl;   diafenthiuron;   diazinon;   ethylene   dibromide;   ethylene  dichloride; dichlorvos;     dicrotophos;     diflubenzuron;     dimethoate;     dimethylvinphos; diofenolan; disulfoton; dnoc; dpx-jw062 and dp; empenthrin [(ez)-(1r)-isomers]; endosulfan; ent 8184; epn; esfenvalerate; ethiofencarb; ethion; ethiprole having the chemical  name 5-amino-3-cyano-1-(2l6-dichldro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4-ethylsulphinylpyrazole;     ethoprophos;     etofenprox;     etrimfos;    famphur; fenitrothion;   fenobucarb;   fenoxycarb;   fenpropathrin;   fenthion;   fenvalerate; fipronil;   flucycloxuron;   flucythrinate;   flufenoxuron;   flufenprox;   flumethrin; fluofenprox;   sodium   fluoride;   sulphuryl   fluoride;   fonofos;   formetanate; formetanate   hydrochloride;   formothion;   furathiocarb;   gamma-hch;   gy-81; halofenozide;        heptachlor;        heptenophos;        hexaflumuron;       sodium hexafluorosilicate;  tar oils;  petroleum;  hydramethylnon;  hydrogen  cyanide; hydroprene; imidacloprid; imiprothin; isazofos; isofenphos; isoprocarb; methyl isothiocyanal;    isoxathion;    lambda-cyhalothrin;   pentachiorophenyl   laurate;<br><br>

An additional aspect of the present invention relates to an use of at least one fungicidal anilinopyrimidine compound, in particular cyprodinil,<br><br>
mepanipyrim   or   pyrimethanil,   and   of   imazalil   in   controlling   fungi   by simultaneous or sequential.<br>
It goes without saying that the different variants or embodiments which may be envisaged both of the compositions and of the methods of treatment and/or protection according to the invention form an integral part of the present invention; it being possible for the said different variants, moreover, to be combined or associated with each other without as a result departing either from the spirit or from the scope of the said invention.<br>
In the same manner, the different aspects of the present invention which have just been described may be combined or associated with each other without as a result departing either from the spirit or from the scope of the said invention.<br>
The examples which follow will allow better illustration of the various aspects of the present invention, in particular of the aspects relating to the compositions and to the methods according to the invention using the said fungicidal compositions. However, these examples do not in any way limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1:<br>
This example gives an illustration of the efficacy of a composition according to the invention for controlling Geotrichum candidum, this trial was carried out in vitro.<br>
The fungicidal compositions are used in solution at the doses detailed in Table 1.<br>
These fungicidal compositions are used in the form of active ingredients previously dissolved in DMSO and then incorporated into a PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) medium in superfusion at the doses previously described in an<br><br>
amount of 6 j*l of fungicidal solution + 1 000 jal of PDA per well of 15 mm in<br>
diameter of a microtitre plate (4 repeats/product).<br>
1 day later, a microdrop of an aqueous suspension of Geotrichum candidum<br>
spores, supplemented with 400 ppm of Tween 20, is brought to the surface of<br>
each well of the microtitre plate.<br>
The cultures are then incubated at 22°C, 60% relative humidity, under subdued<br>
light until the control culture (without fungicide) has covered the entire surface<br>
of the well.<br>
The diameter of each colony is then measured and, in comparison with the<br>
untreated control, a percentage efficacy is calculated using the following<br>
formula:<br>
(diameter of the control - diameter of the trial)/diameter of the control x 100. The results are presented in Table 1 below: (Table Remove)<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Each fungicidal compound, taken in isolation, did not make it possible to control the growth of the fungus whereas the combination provided a significant level of control. Example 2:<br>
This example proposes to give an illustration of the efficacy of a composition according to the invention for combating Gloeosporium spp. on apples, this trial was carried out in vivo.<br>
The fungicidal compositions are used in solution at the doses detailed in Table 2.<br>
Apples of the Golden variety, untreated after harvest, are treated by sprinkling a fungicidal solution up to the run-off limit at the doses described in Table 2 of results (8 apples per product).<br>
6 hours later, the fruit are inoculated by sprinkling an aqueous suspension at 150 000 spores/ml of Gloeosporium spp. obtained from a preculture on PDA<br>
medium. This inoculation by sprinkling is carried out up to the run-off limit.<br>
The fruit are then stored in the dark at 20°C, 100% relative humidity and the<br>
scores for the disease start 3 weeks later, for a period of 2 weeks.<br>
The number of fruit affected by rot are counted and, in comparison with the<br>
untreated control, a percentage efficacy is calculated using the following<br>
formula: (diameter of the control - diameter of the trial)/diameter of the control x 100.<br>
The results are presented in Table 2 below: (Table Remove)<br>
 Table 2<br>
Again, each fungicide, taken in isolation, did not make it possible to control the growth of the fungus whereas the combination provided a significant level of control.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
