The 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivatives of the formula I  are obtainable by various routes, for example by the following<br>
process:<br>
Process A:<br>
Reaction  of pyrazoies of the formula II (where z  - H) with an activated benzoic acid Ilia or a benxoic acid iltfi, which is preferably activated in situ to give the acylating product and subsequently subjecting the latter to a rearrangement reaction,*-<br><br><br><br>
L! is a nucleophilically displaceable leaving group such as halogen, eg. bromine, chlorine, hetaryl, eg. imidazolyl, pyridyl, carboxylate, eg. acetate, trifluoroacetate, and the like.<br>
The activated benzoic acid can be employed directly, as in the case of the benzoyl halides, or it can be prepared in situ, for example with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, triphenylphosphine/azodicarboxylic aster, J-pyridine disulfide/triphenylphosphine, carbonyldiimidazole and the like".<br>
It may be advantageous to carry out the acylation reaction in the presence of a base. The rcoctants and the auxiliary base are nxpediontly employed in equimolar amounts. A small excess of the auxiliary base, for example 1.2 to 1.5 mol equivalents based an II, may be advantageous under certain circumstances.<br>
Suitable auxiliary bases are tertiary alkylamines, pyridine or alkali metal carbonates. Examples of solvents which can be used are chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, ethers such as diethyl ether, methyl tfirt-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or esters such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures of these.<br>
if benzoyl halides are employed as activated earboxylic acid component, it may be expedient to cool the reaction mixture to 0-lo°c when adding this reactant. The mixture is subsequently stirred at 20 - 100°C, preferably at 25 - 50*0, until the reaction is complete. WorK-up is carried out in the customary manner, for example the reaction mixture is poured into water and the product of value is extracted. Especially suitable solvents for this purpose are methylene chloride, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate-After the organic phase has been dried and the solvent removed, the crude ester can be employed without further purification for the rearT mgement reaction.<br>
Rearrangement of the esters to give the compounds of the formula I is expediently carried out at from 20 to 40°c in a solvent and in the presence of a base and, if appropriate, with the aid of a<br>
cyano compound as catalyst.<br><br>

The 3-heUrocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivatives of the formula I and their agriculturally useful salts are suitable as herbicides, both in the form of isomer mixtures and in the form of the pure isomers. The herbicidal compositions comprising compounds of  the formula I effect very good control of vegetation on non-crop areas, especially at high rates of application. In crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and cotton they act against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds without damaging the crop plants substantially. This effect 1B observed especially at low rates of application.<br>
Depending on  the application method in question, the compounds of the formula I,  or herbicidal compositions comprising them, can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are t.hfi following!<br>

Moreover, the compounds of the formula I CAR also be ueed in crops which tolerate the action of herbicides due to breeding including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also<br><br>
highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the inventioV<br>
The herbicidal compositions comprise a herbicidally active amount of at least one compound of the formula X or of an agriculturally useful salt of I and auxiliaries conventionally used for the formulation of crop protection products.<br>

Aqueous uf.R forme can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can bo homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackitier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants (adjuvants) are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, eg. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty aeida, of alkyl- and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl, tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl<br><br>

Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the active substances with a<br>
solid carrier.<br>
Granules, eg, coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bolus, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomacsous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic material, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the compounds of the formula I in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In. general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 951 by weight, of at least one active ingredient. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100* (according to NHH Spectrum).<br>

The compounds of the formula I, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that fchey come into as  little contact as possible, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil {post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Depending on the intended aim of the control measures, the season, the target plants and the growth stage, the application rates of the compound of the formula I are from 0.001 to 3,0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0 kg/ha of active substanz (a.s.)-<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivatives of the formula I can be mixed and applied jointly with a large number of representatives of other groups of herbicidally or growth-regulatory active ingredients. Suitable components in mixtures are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, l,3,4-thiadia2oles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, aryloxy-Zhetaryloxyalkanic acids and their derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2-(hetaroyl/axoyl)-l,3-cyclohexandiones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenyl derivatives, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofuranes, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives, ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones,<br>
N-~phenya-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- and hetaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid ind its derivatives, 2-phenylpropionic acid and its derivatives, pyrazolas, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, pyrimidyl ethers.<br><br>
sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolcarboxaraides and uracils.<br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the compounds of the formula I, alone or in combination with other herbicides, in the form of a mixture with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added.<br>
Use Examples<br>
The herbicidal action of 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivatives of the fomtula I was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments!<br>
The culture containers used were plastic flowerpots containing loamy sand with approximately 3.0% of humus as substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown separately for each species.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the active ingredients, suspended or emulsified in water, were applied directly after sowing by means of finely distributing nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until the plants had rooted. This cover caused uniform germination of the test plants unless this was adversely affected by the active ingredients.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were grown to a plant height of from 3 to 15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated with the active ingredients which had been suspended or emulsified in water. To this end, the test plants were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to treatment. The rate of application for the post-emergence treatment was 31.2 or 15.6 g/ha a.s. (active substance).<br><br>
Depending on the species, the plants were kept at from 10 to 25°c and 20 to 35°C, respectively. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br><br><br><br>
