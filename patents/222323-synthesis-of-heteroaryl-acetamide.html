EXAMPLES<br>
Generally, a stirred Parr reactor was used for reactions under hydrogen, unless a Parr shaker is mentioned. The stirring speed was the same in all experiments and was estimated tote around 300 RPM.<br><br><br>
Alpha hydroxy Zolpidem (AHZ) was prepared by procedures similar to those in US Patent 4,794,185. Samples of this AHZ may have chloride ion in them, up to 0.5% by weight. The chloride ion has an effect on the reduction. Samples were washed with water until the chloride (as NaCI) concentration was as low as possible, in the region of 0.04% chloride by weight.<br>
A solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (6.8 mL) diluted to 40 mL with glacial acetic acid was prepared (this was used for a number of experiments). A sample of low chloride AHZ, 1.50 g, was weighed out into the glass insert of a Parr stirred reactor (450 mL reactor volume). To this was added 37 mL of glacial acetic acid, followed by 3.0 mL of the sulfuric acid in-acetic acid solution (containing 0.51 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid). The mixture was swirled until the solid dissolved. To this was added 25 yL of 1.4M LiBr in water. The mixture was swirled to assure mixing and to wash down any solid on the side of the glass. Then, 260 mg of 5% Pd/BaS04catalyst (Engelhard) was added. The reactor was closed and placed in a heating mantle. Through the appropriate valves, the system was filled with nitrogen and vented several times. Hydrogen was added to a pressure of 10 PSI and vented, twice. The system was filled to a pressure of 20-25 PSI of hydrogen and the stirrer was started at a medium speed. The system was heated to 70°C and controlled using a thermocouple. When the reaction had reached 60-70°C, the system was adjusted to a pressure of 35 PSI of hydrogen. It was closed off from further hydrogen in a reaction on this scale. The reaction was run for 21 hours. In general, a few hours after no hydrogen pressure change was sufficient for essentially complete reaction. The<br><br>
mixture was allowed to cool to 20-40°C. The reactor was vented, filled with nitrogen and vented several times. The mixture was poured into a beaker. A total of 6 mL of glacial acetic acid was usee in rinsing and transferring the mixture from the reactor to the beaker. The mixture was filtered through a Whatman (fiberglass) microfibre filter. The filtrate was poured into 80 mL of ice-cooled water, with stirring. Ammonium hydroxide, approximately 50 mL, was added slowly, to a pH &gt;8. The mixture was stirred ten minutes and filtered. The solid was washed with water. This material was 98.2% Zolpidem base by HPLC area purity. The yield was typically 90%.<br>
Examples run by the above procedure are given in the table below. The reagents are all in the amounts described in Example 1, except for the bromide salt. Reagents of AR quality were used. The total amount of salt solution used is listed in the table. Products with purity of at least 69% were recrystallized from isopropanol, as in Example 1, to give Zolpidem of &gt;95% purity.<br><br>
A solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (6.8 mL) diluted to 40 mL with glacial acetic acid was prepared. A sample of low chloride AHZ, 3.00 g, was weighed out. To this was added 37 mL of glacial acetic acid, followed by 6.0 mL of the sulfuric acid in acetic add solution (contains 1.0 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid). The mixture was swirled until the solid dissolved. To the mixture was added 30 ML of 1.4M NaBr in water. The mixture was swirled to assure mixing and to wash down any solution on the side of the glass. Then, 267 mg of<br><br>
5% Pd/BaS04catalyst (Engelhard) was added. The reactor was closed and placed in a heating mantle. Through the appropriate valves, the system was filled with nitrogen and vented several times. Hydrogen was added to a pressure of 10 PSI and vented, twice. The system was filled to a pressure of 20-25 PSI of hydrogen and the stirrer was started at a medium speed. The system was heated to 70°C and controlled using a thermocouple. When the reaction had reached 60-70°Q, the system was adjusted to a pressure of 30-35 PSI of hydrogen. It was closed off from further hydrogen in a reaction on this scale. The reaction was run at 70°C at least until there was no further pressure change, in this case 17 hours. After the reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool to 20-40°C. The reactor was vented, filled with nitrogen and vented several times. The mixture was poured into a beaker. A total of 8 mL of glacial acetic acid was used in rinsing and transferring the mixture from the reactor to the beaker. The mixture was filtered through a Whatman microfibre filter. The filtrate was poured into 100 mL of ice cooled water, with stirring. Ammonium hydroxide, 55 mL, was added slowly, to a pH &gt;8. The mixture was stirred ten minutes and filtered. The solid was washed with water. This material was 98.4% Zolpidem base by HPLC area purity. The yield was 92%.<br>
Example 7<br>
A solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (6.8 mL) diluted to 40 mL with glacial acetic acid was prepared. A sample of low chloride AHZ, 4.50 g, was weighed out. To this was added 35 mL of glacial acetic acid, followed by 9.0 mL of the sulfuric acid in acetic acid solution (contains 1.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid). The mixture was swirled until the solid dissolved. To this was added 45 pL of 1.4M NaBr in water. The mixture was swirled to assure mixing and to wash down any solid on the side of the glass. Then, 400 mg of 5% Pd/BaS04 catalyst (Engelhard) was added. The reactor was closed and placed in a heating mantle.

stirring. The reactor was vented, filled with nitrogen and vented several times. The mixture was poured into a beaker. A total of 10 mL of glacial acetic acid was used in rinsing and transferring. The mixture was filtered through a Whatman microfibre filter. The filtrate was poured into 130 mL of ice-cooled water with stirring. Ammonium hydroxide, 60 mL, was added slowly to a pH &gt;8. The mixture was stirred ten minutes and filtered. The solid was washed with water. This material was 88.9% Zolpidem base by HPLC area purity, and contained some unreacted AHZ (4.8%).

Example 8 Recrystallization of crude Zolpidem<br>
Some samples were quite pure as a crude product, but some were only around 70% pure; both types were recrystallized from isopropanol.<br>
A 5.9 g sample of crude Zolpidem base of 73% purity (the impurities were mainly AHZ and AHZ-O-Acetate) was recrystallized from 40 mL of isopropanol, stirring it while allowing to cool. Filtration gave 2.7 g of Zolpidem, 98.4% purity by HPLC area.<br>

Example 9 α-hydroxy-zolpidem-O-acetate<br>
The O-Acetate of AHZ was produced along with the Zolpidem product during the course of the above hydrogenations (Examples 1-7), and can be detected in the product in smafl amounts. Simply heating AHZ in glacial acetic acid with the typical amount of sulfuric add present will convert most of it to the acetate in a few hours at 70°C. However, to obtain a clean sample for Example 10, the procedure below was followed.<br><br>

Then, 50 mL of dichloromethane was added followed by 5 mL of 1 M NaOH. The pH was &gt;11. The mixture was separated and the dichloromethane dried with magnesium sulfate. The dichloromethane was evaporated and the residue stirred with 80 mL ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was washed twice with 20 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, evaporated and left under high vacuum for a few hours to give 2.6 g of the desired product The NMR (300 MHz, CDCI3) shows aromatic peaks at 5 values of 8.47 (broad, 1H), 7.56 (m, 3H), 7.28 (m, 2H), 6.83(s, 1H) as well as methyl peaks from 2.3-2.9 (15H total), with the acetate CH3at 5 2.3.<br>
