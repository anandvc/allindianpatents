Under the circumstances, researches on an emulsion-type water-mixed fuel have been made also in Japan, and many patent applications relating to compositions and manufacturing methods therefor have been filed. Some of those applications have been made into a practical use.<br>

As described above, various emulsion-type water-mixed fuels are proposed. However, there still has an aspect of lacking in stable combustion, thereby being not reached a state of being practically adopted. In addition, the diameters of the particles constituting those emulsions are several urn to several tens pm.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have sought the stability, which being identified as the shortcomings of the emulsion-type water-mixed fuel, and have pursued their intensive studies, based on an idea that there needs a mixing thereof under a ultrafine particle state (nanolevel), in order to stably combust the emulsion of water and the combustion oil.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As a result of the intensive studies, the inventors of the present invention found that combustion with high efficiency, which could not be attained by the conventional emulsion fuel,<br><br>
may be realized by reducing an average particle diameter of respective particles in the emulsion fuel into 1,000 nm or less.<br>
Further, the inventors of the present invention found that, in order to stabilize the emulsion of water and the combustion oil so as not to cause separation therein, it is preferred to form a mixture of ultrafine particle state (nano level).<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
In the present invention, an oil and a water are mixed together under ultra fine states to produce an emulsion fuel, thereby being capable of contributing to improve fuel consumption and to make combustion exhaust gas clean.<br>
As a finely-dividing and mixing means used for producing the emulsion fuel of the present invention, for example, there may be given an apparatus, which pressurizes a primary mixture liquid including a water and a combustible oil to finely divides and mixes through a cavitation effect due to turbulence generated at one or two or more of orifices.<br>
Further, as the finely-dividing and mixing means, there may be given an apparatus, which pressurizes a primary mixture liquid including a water and a combustible oil to cause to flow within a pump at a flow rate of 50 m/s or more; accelerates the primary mixture liquid to pass into holes of a wall member having multiple holes each having a diameter of 500 urn or less formed therein; and finely divides and mixes through a cavitation effect due to turbulence generated between flows of the liquid.<br>
In addition, a preferred method for the production of an emulsion fuel includes using: a water-combustible oil primary mixing means for primarily mixing a water and a combustible oil, while adding 10.0 to 150.0 parts by volume of the water (more preferably, 25.0 to 120.0 parts by volume of the.water) with respect to 100 parts by volume of the combustible oil; and a finely-dividing and mixing means for finely-dividing and mixing the water-combustible oil-based primary mixture liquid obtained by the primary mixing means into a fine particle state, to thereby form an emulsion fuel in which an average diameter of the water or the combustible oil is 1,000  nm or less.<br>
Preferably, while adding 25 to 12 0 parts by volume of a water with respect to 100 parts by volume of a combustible oil, the mixture liquid is introduced into Nanomizer (Product Name; apparatus for finely-dividing and mixing a primary mixture liquid dispersed within a liquid sample, which is manufactured by Yoshida Kikai Co. , Ltd.) , and the primary mixture liquid including the water and the combustible oil is finely-divided and mixed, thereby forming an emulsion fuel of a mixture including a ultra fine<br><br>
in being easily mixed together.<br>
Like this, although adjustments of factors such as the reduction potential of the water, temperature, and the pressure of Nanomizer are associated but those are relative to each other. Therefore, in a case where the combustible oil is added to the water having the reduction potential which is lowered to -100 mv or less, preferably -300 mv to -700 mv, and the temperature thereof is raised to 50°C or more, preferably to 70 to 90°C, and the oil and the water are finely-divided and mixed into a ultra fine particle state, there is a relationship that the pressure of Nanomizer may be made relatively small when the reduction potential becomes lower.<br>
Example 1<br>
Descriptions are made of examples and a comparative example of the present invention.<br>
First, 8 L of a water (tap water) was heated to 70°C, and an oxidation-reduction potential thereof was reduced to -114 mv using a bath water reduction apparatus manufactured by Kangen Co., Ltd.<br>
To 1.96 L of the reduced water, 5.88 L of an A heavy oil and 160 cc of an emulsifier were added, and after a primary agitation by a manual agitation, the resultant mixture was caused to pass through Nanomizer with a pressure 3 MP to be finely-divided and mixed, whereby an emulsion fuel of the present invention was produced. The obtained emulsion fuel is a W/O type emulsion, and average diameter of the water in the emulsion was 300 to 500 nm.<br>
The thus obtained emulsion fuel of the present invention was set to be Sample 2. The mixture liquid produced in the same way as in Sample 2 was caused to pass through Nanomizer with 8 MP to obtain an emulsion fuel of the present invention, which was set to be Sample 3.<br>
Further, Sample 1 is a A heavy oil as a comparative example, Sample 4 is a light oil as a comparative example, and Samples 5 and 6 each are obtained by the same processing as in Samples 2 and 3, and are emulsion fuels of the present invention in which the light oil is used in place of the A heavy oil.<br><br><br>
(Sample 5 and Sample 6 were caused to pass through Nanomizer with pressures of 3 MP and 8 MP, respectively, to be finely-divided and mixed).<br>
Details of the respective test samples are listed as follows. (Emulsion fuel, and A heavy oil and light oil for comparison, which were used for engine characteristics test)<br>
Sample 1: A heavy oil 100% (for comparison)<br>
Sample 2: A heavy oil 73.5%, reduced water 24.5%, activator 2%, processed by Nanomizer with 3 MP (emulsion fuel)<br>

Example 2<br>
In this example, a diesel generator of 13ES-type manufactured by Denyo Co. , Ltd. was used to successively measure the concentrations of nitrogen oxides and oxygen within an exhaust gas together with a power generation amount per unit heavy oil, whereby the power generation efficiency of the emulsion fuel of the present invention was measured.<br><br>
As the emulsion fuel of the present invention, an emulsion fuel having a composition including 75 wt% of a Special A heavy oil, 24.7 wt% of a water, and 0.3 wt% of an emulsifier was produced and used.<br>
To 8.33 L of the A heavy oil, 2.50 L of the water and 0.04 L of the emulsifier 0.04 L (100 parts by volume of the heavy oil: 29.7 parts by volume of the water: 0.5 parts by volume of the emulsifier) were added, and after a primary agitation by a manual agitation, the resultant mixture was caused to pass through Nanomizer with a pressure 3 MP to be finely-divided and mixed, thus the emulsion fuel of the present invention was produced. The average diameter of the water in the emulsion fuel was 300 to 500 nm.<br>
The emulsion fuel of the present invention and sole A heavy oil (comparative example) are used as the fuels to successively operate the above-mentioned diesel generator, NOx concentration within the exhaust gas and the power generation amount were measured. The concentrations of NOx and O2 within the exhaust gas were measured successively at an exit smoke-flue of the generator.<br>
The measurement results of the exhaust gas, which was generated by the use of the emulsion fuel of the present invention, are shown in Table 4, and the measurement results of the exhaust gas when the Special A heavy oil was solely used as fuel are shown in Table 5. In the case where the emulsion fuel of the present invention was used, an average NOx concentration within the exhaust gas was 193 ppm. When the heavy oil was solely used as fuel, the average value of the NOx concentration was 369 ppm. As a result, there was found that the NOx concentration within the exhaust gas may be largely reduced by the use of the fuel of the present invention.<br>

The followings are found from the above-mentioned combustion test results of the above-mentioned respective samples.<br>
1.	In all the sample fuels, there was no large variation in performances under full load operation.<br>
2.	In the emulsion fuel, smoke was markedly improved.<br>
3.	The consumption amount (use amount) of the combustible oil for obtaining an output and torque exerted by solely using a combustible oil was reduced by about 25% by using the emulsion fuel of the present invention.<br>
4.	In the emulsion fuel, performance of the engine was<br>
degraded during light loading. The exhaust temperature was also<br>
lowered.<br>
In other words, the emulsion fuel of the present invention,<br><br>
in which 24.5% of the water was added to the A-heavy oil or the light oil, exhibited almost the same characteristics as 100% A-heavy oil or 100% light oil up to 2,200 rpm. This is astonishingly excellent performance.<br>
However, at the rotation of 2,600 rpm or more, it seems to cause a misfire. Accordingly, in a case where the emulsion fuel of the present invention is used for a ship, for instance, it is considered to be good to use a light oil in a harbor, and then to switch to use the emulsion fuel outside the harbor.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, the mixture liquid including a water and a combustible oil is, for example, subjected to a pressure to cause to pass through one or a plurality of small holes, thereby producing the emulsion fuel by finely-diving and mixing the mixture through the cavitation effect due to the turbulence generated when passing through orifices. For example, the emulsion fuel containing about 25% of the finely-divided and mixed water does not cause engine troubles, if being burned within the engine, and exhibits substantially the same output and torque with the A-heavy oil or the light oil. In addition, the fuel consumption amount is also the same even though 25% of the water is contained therein (by simple calculation, 25% of energy saving is attained).<br>
Moreover, the generations of soot and dioxin are reduced into 1/2 to 1/5 (theoretically no generation), and NOx was also reduced into about 1/2 to 1/3. As a result, the emulsion fuel of the present invention has a further energy saving effect as a fuel for combustion furnace, and attains 25 to 35% energy saving. In addition, the waste oil may also be used as a raw material.<br>
Conventionally, the emulsion fuel (water-oil-based emulsion-type water-mixed fuel) is obtained by adding 0.5 to 5% of the emulsifier to the water and oil, and by agitating and mixing the mixture into emulsion, and generally contains particles having an average diameter of several um to several tens pm. Even if the emulsion fuel is produced using a particularly excellent emulsifier, the average particle diameter was about several pm (about 1 to 3 pm), which is a so-called water-mixed  fuel  of an emulsified-state  liquid<br><br>
{emulsion fuel).<br>
However, the emulsion fuel of the emulsified-state liquid has a tendency of separating with elapse of time, and, even if the separation does not occur, has a nature in which the viscosity thereof becomes higher (dilatancy) with the elapse of time, which is opposite to thixotropy, thereby causing an accident such as clogging of a pipe or a nozzle.<br>
The emulsion fuel obtained by the present invention constitutes an emulsion fuel in which the oil and the water are mixed under a ultra fine particle state (nano level), and the average particle diameter constituting the water or the combustible oil is 1, 000 nm, prefer ably200 to 700 nm. As a result, the stability thereof is extremely excellent, and has high combustion efficiency, whereby the emulsion fuel of the present invention may be used for all the purposes such as for an engine, a combustion furnace, an incinerator, a boiler, and a generator.<br>
For example, if the emulsion fuel of the present invention is used for an engine fuel for a vehicle and a ship, 15 to 25% of energy saving may be achieved. Further, soot and dioxin may be reduced into 1/2 to 1/5, and NOx may be reduced about 1/2 to 1/3, thereby attaining low pollution and excellent stability. As a result, it becomes possible to produce the fine particle mixture liquid at a gas station, and to refuel the liquid into a fuel tank of the vehicle as currently carried out.<br>
Moreover, the emulsion fuel of the present invention may be applied for the boiler1, the generator, the combustion furnace and the incinerator, and utilization of the waste oil is possible. Such a result was obtained that, if the emulsion fuel of the present invention is used for the combustion furnace, the energy saving effect may be increased by 30 to 40%.<br><br>
