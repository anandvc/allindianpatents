COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br>
 <br>
24 JUL 2008<br>
 <br>
The invention relates to a process for binding metal nanoparticles to rice husk ash. More particularly the invention relates to a process for binding silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Clean potable water is a basic human requirement. However, a large portion of the world's population, especially those living in developing countries do not have access to clean potable water.<br>
Growing population, lack of sanitary conditions, poverty, poor planning, industrial pollution, over exploitation of natural water and national disasters are the main reasons of contamination of water. This contaminated water is the source of many diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, fever, abdominal pain, and constipation, caused due to bacterial contamination transmitted through water. In India for example, as per the data collected by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in 2003 there were 10.5 million cases of diarrhea with 4709 deaths resulting majorly due to consumption of contaminated water. According to the World Health Organization, the provision of safe water alone can reduce diarrheal and enteric disease by up to 50%, even in the absence of improved sanitation and other hygiene measures.<br>
Rice husk ash has been used as a water purifier but the results obtained are not<br>
consistent over time, the rice husk ash is not able to remove all bacteria, and the filter devices<br>
required for adequate filtration tend to be bulky. Moreover as the rice husk ash has a potential<br>
to trap water born bacteria due to the small size of its pores, trapped bacteria may survive on<br>
the rice husk ash and may even seep into the water that is filtered through the rice husk ash.<br>
In order to use rice husk ash as an effective water filtration medium, there is a need for a<br>
process that would impart antimicrobial properties to rice husk ash, so that the rice husk ash<br>
is also able to destroy microbes that are present in water. There is also a need for a water<br>
2<br>
 <br>
purification composition that is inexpensive, easy to use and effective in removing bacterial<br>
contamination from drinking water.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention relates to a process comprising binding silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash. Silver nanoparticles are synthesized by the reduction of silver precursor using a reducing agent in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Thereafter, rice husk ash is soaked in the as synthesized silver nanoparticles solution for suitable time to obtain rice husk ash bonded to silver nanoparticles. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>

For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,<br>
reference will now be made to the embodiment described and specific language will be used<br>
to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the<br>
invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the process, and<br>
3<br>
 <br>
such further applications of the principles of the invention therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory of the invention and are not intended to be restrictive thereof.<br>
The following description explains the principles of the invention as applied to the bonding of silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash. It is however believed that the teachings of the document may be equally applied to the other metals such as copper, gold, zinc, magnesium, platinum or titanium. In particular, a process for treating rice husk ash with a bactericidal agent is described. The following description also discusses certain specific compounds such as stabilizing agents, reducing agents and surfactants to explain the principles of the invention. The invention however is not restricted to such compounds as equivalent chemical compounds may be utilized to achieve the desired end result as taught by the invention. Reference throughout the specification to an embodiment, an aspect or similar language means that a particular feature, characteristic or step in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. References to an aspect or an embodiment may, but do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.<br>
Rice husk is a perennially renewable agro-waste available  at virtually no  cost<br>
wherever rice paddy is grown. On combustion, the rice husk ash residue contains 85-95%<br>
silica, 4-12% carbon and the rest comprises of various metal oxides such as alkali, alkali<br>
earth metal and ion oxides. On account of its crypto-crystalline or amorphous and highly<br>
porous structure, the BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) surface area of rice husk ash can be as<br>
high as 80-100 square meters per gram, depending on the conditions employed for the<br>
combustion of rice husk. Its high surface area and porosity make rice husk ash an effective<br>
filtration medium that removes particulate matter as.well as color and odor from water.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
The rice husk ash used for the process may be any rice husk ash that is produced by burning rice husk. The rice husk may be produced by burning rice husk in heaps, in a step grate furnace, fluidized bed furnace or tube-in-basket (TiB) burner. The rice husk ash may also be obtained from boilers and brick kiln, provided it is free of unburned husk and wood tar, grit, stone, and fused lumps of silica. In accordance with an aspect the rice husk ash should have high silica content. Preferably the rice husk ash should have silica content of 60 to 90%.<br>
Silver is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent that is lethal to single cell microorganism but is harmless to human cells. Silver's antimicrobial property stems from its extremely slow release of silver ions. These silver ions bind to the cellular components of microorganisms, disrupting the normal reproduction and growth cycle resulting in the death of the microbial cell. When made into particles only a few nanometers in size silver releases a lot more ions and therefore becomes an even stronger antimicrobial agent. Moreover unlike silver ions, elemental silver (Ag°) is not deactivated by chloride or organic matter that may be present in water. These qualities make nano silver a suitable anti microbial agent that may be bound to rice husk ash to impart antimicrobial properties to the rice husk ash.<br>
A process for binding silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash is described. The process effectively binds silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash such that minimum leaching of silver occurs when water is passed through the rice husk ash. The rice husk ash with bonded silver nanoparticles is a useful composition for water purification and the bactericidal qualities of rice husk ash and silver work together in making the composition very effective.<br>
The process involves preparing silver nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilising agent and adding to the rice husk ash the silver nanoparticles to obtain rice husk ash with bonded silver nanoparticles.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
The process involves the preparation of silver nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilising agent. The silver nanoparticles may be prepared in the presence of a stabilising agent by any known method. The stabilizing agent prevents the aggregation of nanoparticles during their formation by capping the silver nanoparticles that are formed. The stabilizing agent also facilitates in binding of silver nanoparticles to rice husk ash due to associated charge. The silver nanoparticles formed are then added to rice husk ash to obtain rice husk ash with bonded silver nanoparticles. In accordance with an aspect the silver nanoparticles are prepared in an aqueous medium.<br>
In accordance with an aspect the silver nanoparticles are prepared in the presence of a stabilizing agent and stored to avoid aggregation of the prepared nanoparticles. The rice husk ash is added to the solution of capped silver nanoparticles to obtain rice husk ash with bonded nanoparticles.<br>
In accordance with an aspect the rice husk ash is soaked with the silver nanoparticles for a predetermined period of time. The rice husk ash is soaked with the silver nanoparticles for a period ranging from 10 minutes to 24 hours and preferably for a period of 12 hours.<br>
The rice husk ash to which silver nanoparticles are bonded is separated and washed with water. The rice husk ash with bound silver nanoparticles may be separated by any means including but not limited to filtration or centrifugation, and preferably filtration. The separated rice husk ash to which nano silver is bonded is washed with copious amount of water and the water used for washing the rice husk ash with bound nano silver may be removed by any method including but not limited to filtration or vacuum filtration, preferably filtration. The rice husk ash to which silver nanoparticles are bound is dried by any method including but not limited to air drying or drying in a vacuum oven.<br>
6<br>
