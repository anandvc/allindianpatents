PROMOTERS EXHIBITING ENDOTHELIAL CELL SPECIFICITY AND<br>
METI-IODS OF USING Salve<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF TFIE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to isolated polynucleotide sequences exhibiting endothelial cell specific promoter activity, and methods of use thereof and, more particularly, to a modified-preproendothelin-1 (PPE-1) promoter which exhibits increased activity  and specificity in endothelial cells. The invention further relates to modifications of the PPE promoter which enhance its expression in response to physiological conditions including hypoxia and angiogenesis.<br>
Gene therapy is an emerging modality for treating inherited and acquired human diseases. Great efforts are directed towards developing methods for gene therapy of cancer, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, but there is still a major obstacle in effective and specific gene delivery. In general, the main limiting factor of gene therapy with a gene of interest using a recombinant viral vector as a shuttle is the ability to specifically direct the gene of interest to the target tissue. Adenoviruses that are used for this purpose are capable of infecting a large variety of cells with different affinities. Indeed, using a non-tissue specific promoter induces up to 95% of the expression of the gene of interest in the liver; hence regulation of expression is highly required. Further, it is currently infeasible to differentiate between normal vascular endothelia and developing vascular endothelia in a growing tumor when targeting a gene.<br>
In both cancer development and vascular diseases, angiogenesis, the creation of new vessels, plug’s a central role. Hence, regulation of this process by gene therapy to the vascular endothelium can be tremendously important in inducing targeted therapy for these diseases.<br>
High efficiency of the human preproendothelin-1 (PPE-l), delivered by retroviral vector, was obtained in endothelial cells (EC) in-vitro, and in transgenic animal models. However, the prior art does not teach use of this<br><br>
promoter for in-vivo gene therapy. The human PPE-1 lacks regulatory elements found in PPE-1 genes of other animals, most notably the mouse.<br>
United States patent 5,747,340 teaches use of the murine PPE-1 promoter and portions thereof However, this patent contains no hint or suggestion that an endothelial-specific enhancer can be employed to increase the level of expression achieved with the PPE promoter while preening endothelial specificity. Further, this patent does not teach that the PPE-1 promoter is induced to higher levels of transcription under hypoxic conditions.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, an improved endothelial cell specific promoter, methods of use thereof and cells transformed therewith devoid of the above limitations. The disclosed invention is expected to demonstrate added utility in treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer and wound healing relative to previously known configurations.<br>

DESCRIPTIQN OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of an improved endothelial cell-specific promoter which can be employed to reliably direct high-level expression of a sequence of interest to endothelial cells and in particular endothelial cells participating in angiogenesis.<br>
The principles and use of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and tlie arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the examples and drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br><br>
Although endothelial specific promoters have been previously described (e.g. United States patent 5,747,340) these promoters have typically been inefficient at directing expression to endothelial cells or have not been demonstrated as being specific to endothelia cells in-vivo.<br>
Enhancer elements specific to endothelial cells have also been described. Bu et al. (J.Biol Chem. (1997) 272(19): 32613-32622) have demonstrated that three copies (3X) of the IX enhancer element of PPE-1 (containing elements ETE-C, ETE-Dj and ETE-E) endows promoter sequences with endothelial cell specificity in-vitro, however such activity has not been demonstrated in-vivo.<br>
As is well known in the art, in-vitro experiments cannot reliably predict in-vivo results. As such, the results presented by Bu et al., although suggestive of endothelial cell specific it)’ do not provide sufficient evidence as to the utility of 3X enhancer element in-vivo.<br>
The lack of in-vivo studies also brings into question the endothelial cell specificity of the 3X enhancer element in whole organisms. Lack of this data implies that therapeutic application of this element is questionable, because when employed in-vivo. and in particular when employed for regulating angiogenesis, it is imperative that expression of an angiogenesis regulator (e.g., cell toxin) be directed specifically to endothelial cells, preferably in a specific subset of endothelial cells which are involved in angiogenesis.<br>
As is illustrated in the examples section which follows, the present inventors, through laborious experimentation, have provided, for the first time, conclusive evidence as to the in-vivo activity of the 3X enhancer element. Such evidence identifies the 3X element and its sequence derivatives (e.g., SEQ ID N0:7) as highly suitable for use in therapeutic applications.<br>
In addition, in reducing the present invention to practice, it was discovered that a novel configuration of the PPE-1 enlaces sequence of the present invention endows promoter sequences with an unexpected and highly specific activity in endothelial cells participating in angiogenesis.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided<br><br>
an isolated polynucleotide functional as an endothelial cell specific promoter in a mammal such as a human being.<br>
The isolated polynucleotide includes an enhancer element including one or more copies of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:6 and preferably one or more copies of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:85 which as is illustrated in the Examples section which follows, plays an important role in regulating expression in endothelial cells participating in angiogenesis.<br>
One specific and novel sequence configuration of an enlace element utilizable by the present invention is illustrated in SEQ ID NO:7.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term "enhancer*' refers to any polynucleotide sequence which increases the transcriptional efficiency of a promoter.<br>
According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated polynucleotide includes contiguous copies of SEQ ID N0s:6 and/or 8. Such sequences are preferably positioned in a head-to-tail orientation, although, the enhancer element of the present invention can also include one or more copies of a specific portion of the sequence of SEQ ID N0:6 or 8, in an inverted orientation, e.g,, by using sequences complementary to SEQ ID N0:6 or 8 in construction of the enhancer element.<br>
Preferably the isolated polynucleotide further includes an endothelial cell-specific promoter sequence element. For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term "promoter" refers to any polynucleotide sequence capable of mediating KNA transcription of a downstream sequence of interest. The endothelial specific promoter element may include, for example, at least one copy of the PPE-1 promoter.<br>
Preferably, the isolated polynucleotide further includes a hypoxia response element, .for example at least one copy of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5.<br>
Thus, according to this aspect of the present invention, an endothelial cell specific promoter which includes various enhancer element configurations<br><br>
is provided.<br>
It will be appreciated that the enhancer element sequences can be positioned within the promoter sequence used, upstream of the promoter, between the promoter and a downstream sequence of interest or within the sequence of interest (e.g., intron).<br>
The isolated nucleic acid sequence of the present invention can be used to regulate gene expression in eukaryotic tissue, and in particular, in proliferating endothelial cells, for example endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis-<br>
Thus, the isolated polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be provided, in some cases, as part of a nucleic acid construct further including a nucleic acid sequence of interest which is positioned under the regulatory control of the isolated polynucleotide of the present invention. It will be appreciated that such a nucleic acid construct can further include any additional polynucleotide sequences such as for example, sequences encoding selection markers, origin of replication in bacteria, or sequences encoding reporter polypeptides. Such a nucleic acid construct is preferably configured for mammalian cell expression and can be of viral origin. Numerous examples of nucleic acid constructs suitable for mammalian expression are known in the art; the Examples section which follows provides further detail of several such constructs.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the phrase 'sequence of interest" refers to any polynucleotide sequence which has the capacity)’ to be transcribed by an RNA polymerases. This definition includes coding sequences translatable into polypeptides, as well as sequence for antisense RNA, RNA which binds DNA, ribozymes and other molecular moieties which are not destined to undergo translation. Examples of nucleic acid sequence of interest which may be used by the construct according to the present invention are provided hereinbelow and in the Examples section which follows.<br><br>
Examples presented hereinbelow illustrate that the improved endothelial cell specific promoters of the present invention can reliably direct expression of a reporter gene to endothelial tissue after systemic in-vivo administration. These examples further show, for the first time, that the isolated polynucleotide of the present invention can be used to preferentially express a reporter protein (GFP) in atherosclerotic and/or angiogenic tissue, thus providing for the first time direct evidence as to the importance of the PPE-1 enhancer element and its derivative in therapeutic applications.<br>
While use of a reporter protein, such as GFP, may have utility in detection of early stages of metastatic tumor growth, especially in animal models, or for non-invasive imaging of metastases (Yang, M. et ah, Proc. Nat. Acad, of Sci. (2001) 27:2616-2621) such a use is only a small portion of the projected utility of the claimed invention. It is believed, for example, that AdPPE-lGFP can be used in a combination with AdPPEltk, AdPPE-lp55 and/or other anti-angiogenic treatments, in order to follow and treat angiogenesis by a relatively non-invasive meteor.<br>
Replacement of the GFP reporter gene with an apoptosis inducing factor (e.g. p55; GenBank accession M75866) in a construct of, for example AdPPB-l-3X"p55 is predicted to reliably target apoptosis to rapidly proliferating endothelial cells in angiogenic blood vessels of a growing tumor. Because such a vector may be administered systemically, it can be employed to effectively induce apoptosis in developing metastatic foci, without discovering the location of those foci. Such a use represents a significant improvement in comparison to prior art practice. By inducing apoptosis specifically in developing vasculature, it is feasible to eliminate angiogenesis.<br>
An opposite approach may be used to re-vascularize tissue, for example in atherosclerotic patients or in patients that have suffered significant impairment of peripheral circulation as a result of disease or injury. In this case, a construct of the type AdPPE-l-3X-GF, where GF is a growth factor (e,g,, cytokine) or munificent thereof (e.g., AdPPE-1-SEQ ID N0:7-GF), can<br><br>
be employed. Suitable   factors for use in this context include, but are not limited to, VEGF (GenBank accession M95200) and rat PDGF- BB (GenBanlv accession; 99% identity to muS'AFI62784) and EGR-1 (GenBank accession M22326) Fog’s (including, but not limited to, GenBank accession XM 003306) and combinations thereof<br>
It will be appreciated that incoq’oration of a hypoxia response element (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 5) within the promoter sequence of the present invention can be used to further enhance expression   to Ischemic tissues, thus lead jig to neo-visualization of selected tissues. As the blood supply improves, Ischemia is relieved, the hypoxia response element ceases to be induced, GF levels decline and the neo-vascularization process is halted.<br>
The promoter sequences generated according to the teachings of the present invention are particularly useful in regulating angiogenesis in a tissue. As illustrated in the Examples section which follows, the modified 3X (SEQ. ID. N0;7) containing promoter sequence of the present invention and the unmodified PPE-1 promoter are both expressed in metastatic foci of the LLC model However example 22 clearly illustrates that the modified 3X sequence is specifically responsible for both a decrease in expression levels of the reporter gene in normal lung and a dramatic increase in expression of the reporter gene in metastatic foci. There is neither a hint nor a suggestion in the prior art that such a result could be achieved. Thus, use of a construct including the 3X element in a gene therapy context can be expected to maximize delivery to tumors while minimizing toxic effects on surrounding normal tissue. Significantly, this is true even if the surrounding fissure contains an endothelial component, as illustrated in Figure 37, This is because, as demonstrated in example 11, the 3X sequence greatly increases the level of expression in rapidly proliferating endothelial tissue, even in the context of the PPE-1 promoter.<br>
For example, the p55 gene might be used in conjunction with a promoter of the present invention containing a hypoxia response element in order to specifically induce apoptosis in growing tumors.   Such a strategy is deemed<br><br>
feasible because a growing tumor mass tends toward ischemia as tumor growth often exceeds the angiogenic capacity of the surrounding tissue. Other expressible cell toxins which can be used along with the promoter sequence of the present invention in order to specifically reduce a tumor mass include but are not limited to, other pro-apoptotic genes, the Herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene (HSV-  included in the   expression vector available from InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) antistatic (GenBanlv accession number X05199), endostatin (Genbank accession number MS3272) and angiostatin-endostatin chimera (included in the pORF-HSVltk expression vector available from InvivoGen, San Diego, CA).<br>
Alternately, or additionally, antistatic or understating genes might be used in conjunction with a promoter of the present invention in order to specifically block angiogenesis without inducing apoptosis.<br>
Thus, according to alternate preferred embodiments, angiogenesis may be stimulated or blocked. This flexibility will allow varied uses of the invention including, but not limited to reduction of tumor mass and revascularization of atherosclerotic regions of the heart or neo-vascularization of peripheral tissues with an inadequate blood supply. One relevant clinical scenario is use of a promoter according to the present invention to generate new blood vessels to increase the blood supply in limbs of diabetic patients.<br>
The nucleic acid construct according to the present invention can be administered to a subject (mammals, preferably humans) per se’ or in a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with suitable carriers or excipients.<br>
As used herein a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation of one or more of the active ingredients described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.<br>
Herein the term "active ingredient" refers to the nucleic acid construct<br><br>
accountable for the biological effect.<br>
Hereinafter, the plirases "physiologically acceptable carrier" and 'pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" which may be interchangeably used refer to a earner or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological   and properties of the administered compound. An adjuvant is included under these phrases.<br>
Herein the term "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Teclmiques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g,, by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragees-making, levitating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes-Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active ingredients into preparations which, can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
For injection, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution. Ringer's solution, or physiological salt buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the isolated polynucleotide of the present invention has been isolated based on its capacity to promote or enhance transcription in eukaryotic cells of an endothelial lineage. Therefore a maniinalian cell transformed with a claimed isolated polynucleotide is an additional embodiment of the invention. Numerous examples of such transformed cells are provided in examples recited herein below.<br>
While the examples provided hereinbelow deal specifically with the use of the 3X sequence in conjunction with the PPE-1 promoter, it is anticipated that the enhancer sequence of the present invention will also exert its cell specific effect when used with other eukaryotic promoter sequences.<br>
Such anticipation is based on prior art findings which show that enlace elements are often portable, i.e., they can be transferred from one promoter sequence to another, unrelated, promoter sequence and still maintain activity. For examples, see D. Jones et al, (Dev. Biol. (1995) 171(1):60’72); N. S- Yew et al, (Mol. Ther. (2001) 4:75-820) and L. Wu, et al (Gene Ther. (2001) 8;1416~26)- Indeed, the earlier work of Bu et al. (J.Biol Chem. (1997) 272(19): 32613-32622) strongly suggests that enhancer elements related to those of the present invention, for example enhancers including SEQ ID NO: 6 may be used with constitutive promoters, for example the SV-40 promoter. As such, constructs containing, methods employing and isolated polynucleotides including a eukaryotic promoter modified to include the enhancer sequence of the present invention are well within the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
Thus, it is postulated that a minimal configuration of an enhancer element according to the present invention is an isolated polynucleotide as set forth in SEQ ID N0;8. This enhancer is anticipated to function with a wide variety of promoters, including but not limited to endothelial specific promoters (e,g. PPE-1; SEQ ID NO.: 1) and constitutive promoters, for example viral promoters such as those derived   CMV and SV-40. This enhancer should be capable of imparting endothelial specificity to a wide variety of promoters. The enhancer element may be augmented, for example by addition of one or<br><br>
more copies of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:6. These additional sequences may be added contiguously or non-contiguously to the sequence of SEQ ID NO.: 8.<br>
The present invention further includes a method of expressing a nucleic acid sequence of interest in endothehal cells employing a construct which relies upon an enhancer element including at least one copy of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:8 and a promoter to direct high level expression of the sequence of interest specifically to endothelial cells.<br>
As used herein "ex-vivo administration to cells removed from a body of a subject and subsequent reintroduction of the cells into the body of the subject" specifically includes use of stem cells as described in (Lyden et al. (2001) Nature Medicine 7:1194-1201).<br>
While adenoviruses are employed in the experiments described in examples presented hereinbelow, the constructs of the present invention could be easily adapted by those of ordinary)’ skill in the art to other viral delivery systems.<br>
Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Additionally, each of the various embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated hereinabove and as claimed in the claims section below finds experimental support in the following examples.<br>

Liiciferase activity in cells and tissues<br>
To assay the PPE-1 promoter activity quantitatively in-vitro and in-vivo, a Luciferase gene expression system kit was employed (Promega Corp., Madison, Wl). Forty eight hours post transfection or transduction the cells were washed and 200|il lysis buffer was added for 15 minutes. Cells lysates were collected and centrifuged for 15 minutes (14,000rpm) at 4*’C, Subsequently, lOjil of the supernatant was added to 50’il Luciferase assay buffer.

Results were expressed as Luciferase light units per Ip-g protein. Protein was measured using tlie Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard,<br>
GFP activity in-vitro and in-vivo<br>
To test GFP expression in-vitro, cells were washed twice Avith PBS and were fixed for 30 minutes with freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, examination by fluorescent microscopy was conducted.<br>
In order to test the cellular distribution of the delivered gene in-vivo, tissues were fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in OT M phosphate buffer for 6 hours at A’C, soaked overnight in 30% sucrose at 4°C and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura, USA), The tissue blocks were sliced by a cryostat at<br><br>
10 j-im thickness and observed directly under fluorescence microscopy (FITC filter).<br>
Proliferating and quiescent cells<br>
In order to compare the PPE-1 promoter activity in proliferating and quiescent BAEC, the cells were divided into t’vo groups: 1. proliferating cells -growing and infecting in 10% PCS media. 2. quiescent cells - growing and infected in serum free media started in 72 hours prior to the transduction. All cells were grown in humidified incubator, 5% CO?, 37’C,<br>
Preparation of recombinant replication deficient adenoviruses.<br>
Several recombinant replication deficient adenoviruses (type 5) were constructed. An expression cassette including the murine preproendothelin-1 (PPE-1) promoter (SEQ ID N0:1) located upstream to the Luciferase gene (originated from pGL2-basic GenBank Accession number X65323) and the SV40 polyA site (originated from pGL2-basic GenBank Accession number X65323) was ligated into the BamHI restriction site of pPAC.plpA (promoterless construct). The GPP gene (originated from pEGFP, GenBank accession number AAB02572) was ligated to the PPE-1 promoter at the NotI restriction site. The replication deficient recombinant adenoviruses termed AdSPPE'lLuc or Ad5PPE-lGFP were prepared by co-transfection of pPACPPE-lLuc or Ad5PPE&gt;lGFP with adenovirus plasraid pJM17 as described by Becker, T.C, et al. (Methods Cell biol 43, Roth M. (ed). New York-Academic Press, 1994, pp. 161-189) followed by harvest of recombinant virions.<br>
Viruses were prepared for large-scale production. The viral stocks were stored at 4V at concentration of 10’-10’’ plaque-forming units/ml (pfu/ml). The viruses AdSCMV-Luc (kindly provided by R. Gerard from UTSw Dallas, Texas) and Ad5CMV-GFP (Quantum biotechnologies, Carlsbad, Canada) containing the cj’omegalovims (CMV) immediate early promoter (GenBank Accession number U47119) were prepared for large scale preparation as described for the PPE-1 viral vectors and were used as a non-tissue specific control.<br><br>
Modifications of the PPE promoter’<br>
The modified murine PPE-1 promoter was developed by inserting three copi'es of the positive transcription element discovered by Bu et al (J.Biol Chem, (1997) 272(19): 32613-32622) into the Nhel restriction enzyme site located downstream (-286bp) to the 43 base pairs endogenous positive element (-364 to-320 bp).<br>
The enhancer fragment temied herein "3X" is a triplicate copy of an endogenous sequence element (nucleotide coordinates 407-452 of SEQ ID N0:1) present in the murine PPE-1 promoter. It has been previously shown that induction of PPE-1 promoter activity in vascular endothelial cells depends on the presence of this element Bu et al (J,Biol Chem. (1997) 272(19): 32613-32622). The 3X fragment was synthesized by using tvv'o complementary single stranded DNA strands 96 base pares in length (BioTechnology industries; Nes Tziona, Israel), (SEQ ID NO: 2 and 3). The two single stranded DNA fragment were amiealed and filled using Klenow fragment (NEB); the resulting double stranded DNA was 145 base pairs long and included Nhe-1 restriction sites (SEQ ID NO: 4),<br>
The 3X fragment was ligated into the murine PPE-1 promoter down stream of endogenous Nhe-1 site using T4 Ligase. The resulting constmct was propagated in DH5a compatent cells and a large-scale plasmid preparation was produced using the maxi-prep Qiagene kit.<br>
Additional Plasmids wild type PPE-l promoter<br>
The PPE-1-Luciferase cassette (5249bp) containing 1.4kb of the murine preproendothelin-1 (PPE-1) promoter, the Luciferase gene with an SV40 polyA signal (GenBank Accession number X 65323) site and the first intron of the murine ET-I gene is originated from the pEL8 plasmid (8848bp) used by Harats et al (J. Clin. Inv, (1995) 95: 1335-1344), The PPE-1-Luciferase cassette was extracted from the pEL8 plasmid by using the BamHI restriction enzyme,<br><br>
following by extraction of the DNA fragment from a 1% agarose gel using an extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Gennany).<br>
The promoier-less pPA C.plpA piasmid<br>
The promoter-less pPAC.pIpA piasmid (7594bp) containing sequences of the adenovirus t&gt;'pe 5 was originated from the pPACCiMY.pLpA (8800bp). The CMV promoter, the multiple cloning site and the SV40 polyadenylation site (1206 bp) were eliminated by NotI restriction enzyme, The fragmented DNA was extracted from 1% agarose gel The linear piasmid (7594 bp) was filled-in by Klenow fragment and BamHl linker was ligated by rapid DNA ligation kit to both cohesive ends. The linear piasmid was re-ligated by T4 DNA ligase and transfomied into DH5a competent cells, in order to amplify the pPAC.plpA v/ith the BamHl restriction sites. The piasmid was prepared for large-scale preparation and purified by maxi prep DNA purification kit.<br>
pPA CPPE'lLuciferase piasmid<br>
The pPACPPE-lLuciferase piasmid was constructed by inserting the PPE-1-Luciferase cassette into the BamHl restriction site of the pPACplpA piasmid, by using T4 DNA ligase. The piasmid was subsequently used to transform DH5a competent cells. The piasmid (12843bp) was prepared for large-scale preparation and purified by maxi prep DNA purification kit.<br>
pPA CPPE-1GFP piasmid<br>
The pPACPPE-lGFP piasmid was constructed by sub-cloning the GFP gene (originated from pEGFP, GenBank accession number AAB02572) downstream to the PPE-1 promoter into the NotI restriction site, by T4 DNA ligase.<br>
The piasmid was subsequently used to transform DH5a competent cells. The piasmid (11,801 bp) was prepared for large-scale preparation and purified by maxi prep DNA purification kit.<br>
j}ACPPE-13X Luciferase andpACPPE-13X GFPplasmids<br>
The pP ACPPE-1 -3XLuciferase and pPACPPE-1 -SXGFP were constructed by inserting the PPE-1-3XLuc or PPE-1-3XGFP cassette digested<br><br>
by BamHI restriction enz}’me from pEL8-3X (Figure 26B) containing Luc or GFP into the BamHI restriction site of the pPACplpA plasmid. pEL8-3X contains the modified murine PPE-1 promoter (L55kb) (red) - located between BamHI and NotI that contains the triplicate endothelial specific enhancer 3X (as set forth in SEQ ID NO.: 7) located between two Nhel site. The promoter, the Luciferase or GFP gene, the SV40 poly A sites and the first intron of the endothelin-I gene, all termed the PPE-1 modified promoter cassette was digested and extracted by BamHI restriction enzyme as described in materials and methods. The plasmids (12843bp) were prepared for large-scale preparation and purified by maxi prep DNA purification kit.<br>
In-vitro experiment’ DNA transduction<br>
Cells were plated in 16 mm dishes 24 hours before transduction. DNA transduction of BAEC (Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells), HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells), LLC (Lewis Lung Carcinoma) and RIN (Rat insulinoma), HepG2, HeLa and Normal skin fibroblasts (NSF) cells was performed by incubating each cell line with L 5 and 10 multiplicity of infection (moi) of Ad5PPE-lLuc for 4 h in a total volume of 500 \x\ growing media, following by incubation with the growing media in a total volume of 2 ml for 48 hours. AdSCMVLuc was used as a non-tissue specific control.<br>

All animal procedures were approved by the "Animal Care and Use Committee" of Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer.<br>
Different mouse strains were used:<br>
(i)      MalCj 3 months old, wild type C57BL/6 mice (Harlan farms, Jerusalem, Israel),<br>
(ii)     Male 3  montli old BALB/C mice (Harlan farms, Jemsalem,<br>
Israel), (iii)     Male and female 6 month old ApoE gene deficient mice hybrids<br>

(iv) Male and female 3 month old over-expressing the Luciferase gene under the control of murine PPE-1 promoter (5.9Kb), generated by liarats et al. (J. Clin. Inv. (1995) 95: 1335’1344).<br>
All mice were grown in the Lipids and Atherosclerosis Research Institute.<br>
Tissue gene expression in normal mice<br>
To assay the efficiency and tissue specificity, 10'‘ pfu/ml of Ad5PPElLuc or Ad5C’'‘VLuc (as non-tissue-specific control), were suspended in 100 }il of physiological saline and injected into the tail vein of mice as described hereinabove, Luciferase activity was assayed 1, 5, 14, 30 and 90 days post-injection. To localize cellular distribution of the expressed reporter genes, AdSPPE’lGFP or Ad5CM\’GFP (lO'o pfu/ml in 100 |il physiological saline) were injected into the tail vein of normal 3 month old, male C57BL/6 mice. GFP expression w’as detected five days post-injection. All mice appeared healthy and no toxicity or inflanamation was noted in the Uver or other tissue.<br>
GFP activity in tissues<br>
To test the cellular distribution of the delivered gene in-vivo, tissue samples from injected mice were fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 6 hours at 4’C, soaked overnight in 30% sucrose at 4*’C and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura, California, USA). The tissue blocks were sliced at 10 jim thickness and observed directly under fluorescence microscopy (FITC filter).<br>
Tumor implantation<br>
Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells (LLC) w’ere harvested with tiypsin/EDTA, washed 3 times with PBS and counted wdth 0T% tr&gt;‘pan blue (Biological industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel) to assess their viability. In order to test the level of activity of the PPE-1 promoter activity in tumor angiogenesis in mice, two different tumor models were used.<br>
In the primary tumor model, the cells (1x10’ cells/ml in 100 \\X physiological saline) were subcutaneously injected to the mice backs (n=17).<br><br>
Twenty-one days post injection Ad5PPE-l, Ad5PPE-lGFP, Ad5CMV, or AdSCMVGFP (lO’’pfu/ml) were injected into the tumor tissue (IT) or intravenously and their activity was detected as described above.<br>
In the metastatic tumor model, the cells (5x10’ cells/ml in 50 ‘l physiological saline) were injected to the mice foot-pad (n=12). When the tumor tissue reached a size of 0.7 mm in diameter, the foot pad (with the primary tumor) was resected under anaesthetic and sterile conditions. Fourteen days post surgety the viruses (Ad5PPE-l, Ad5PPE-lGFP, AdSCMVLuc or AdSCMVGFP) were injected to the mouse tail A’ein,<br>
In both tumor experimental models mice were sacrificed 5 days post viral injection, their tissues were excised and tested for Luciferase or GFP activities.<br>
Wound healing model<br>
Male 3 month old C57BL/6 mice were anaesthetized by subcutaneous injection of sodium pentobarbital (6mg/kg). Their backs were shaved and 5 cm of straight incisions was made. The incisions were immediately sutured by 4/0 sterile silk thread. The angiogenic process in the healing wound was examined every two days by H&amp;E and anti von-Willibrand antibody immuno-histochemistry staining.<br>
Ten days post incisions lO'Vft’/nil of Ad5PPE-lLuc or AdSCMVLuc were systemically injected to the tail vein. Five days post injections the mice were sacrificed and Luciferase activity was assayed as described above in the skin of the incision site and in the normal contra lateral site as a control.<br>
Histological examination<br>
In order to evaluate the extent of angiogenesis in tumor and metastasized<br>
tissue, the tissues were sliced into 5 \xm sections and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E). Anti CD31 (rat anti mouse CD31 monoclonal Ab. Pharminogen, NJ, LISA) antibodies were used for analyses of neovascularization in the tumor models.<br><br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Analysis between groups for statistically significant differences was performed with the use of t’est ANOVA, or the Mann-Whitney Rank test. Data are shown as mean+SE.<br>
EXiMPLE 1 Analysis of SX-PPE-l plasmid activity in-vitro<br>
In order to analyze the activity of the PPE-1-3X, a comparison of reporter gene expression in the PPE-1-3X promoter plasmid and the unmodified PPE-1 promoter plasmid was undertaken. Reporter gene plasmids containing either the PPE-1-3X fragment or the umuodified PPE-1 fragment and the reporter gene Luciferase were transfected into endothelial and non-endothelial cell lines as well as to a bronchial epithelium cell line (B2B) which express the PPE-1 promoter (see materials and methods above). The B2B cell line was chosen to provide an indication of the 3X element's capacity to reduce expression in non-endothelial cell lines relative to the PPE-l promoter. Transfection was accomplished using lipofectamine (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A pgal-neo plasmid was employed as an indicator of the transfection efficiency in each case according to accepted molecular biology practice.<br>
Forty-eight hours post transfection., the cells were harvested using lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and Luciferase activity was analyzed by a luminometer (TD-20e - Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, California). In parallel, Pgal activity was analyzed in order to standardize for different transformation efficiencies. The results are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1. Luciferase activity under the control of PPE-3X is 15-20 times higher than Luciferase activity under the control of the unmodified PPE-L In non-endothelial cell lines minimal expression was detected using both the PPE-1 and PPE-1-3X. This demonstrates that PPE-3X is a promising candidate for deliver}’ of a gene specifically into endothelial cells in-vivo.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 Activity and specificity ofAd5PPE-l/Luciferase iu-vitro<br>
The PPE-1/Luciferase, PPE-1-3X/Luciferase, PPE-1/GFP and PPE-1-3X/GFP were also ligated into the Ad5 plasmid to produce Ad5PPE-l/Luc and Ad5PPE-l-3X/luc, Ad5PPE-l/GFP and Ad5PPE-l-3X/GFP (Varda-Bloom et al., (2001) Gene therapy 8:819-827). These constructs were assayed separately as detailed hereinbelow.<br>
In order to test the activity of the Ad5PPE-lAuc, transfections of B2B (Human bronchial epithelial), BAEC (Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells) and HIA’C (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) were undertaken. These three cell lines express the endothelin gene and were chosen to indicate levels of expression of the tested construct in an endothelial cell. The RIN (Rat Insulinoma) cell line , which does not express endothelin, was employed as a negative control and transfected with the same construct. AdSCKlVLuc (Luciferase under the control of C1M\' promoter) was used as non-endothelial-specific control in all cell lines.<br>
Figure 2 clearly illustrates that higher Luciferase expression was achieved in endothelial BAEC and HUVEC cell lines with the PPE-1 promoter than with the CMV promoter. In the RIN cells, which are not of endothelial origin, the CMV promoter produced more Luciferase activit}' than the PPE-1 promoter. These results demonstrate the endothelial specificity of the unmodified PPE-1 promoter.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3 Activity ami specificity ofAd5PPE-3XLiic and AdSPPE-SXGFP<br>
The Ad5PPE-3X/Luciferase and Ad5PPE-3X/GFP constructs were used to transfect the cell lines described hereinabove in Example 2 in order to ascertain the impact of the 3X element on specificity and expression levels. As in example 2, AdSCMVLuc was used as a non-endothelial-specific control. Higher Luciferase expression in BAEC and HLWEC cell lines was detected under the control of the PPE-3X promoter as compared to the CMV promoter.<br>
Figure 3a is a photomicrograph illustrating GFP expression under the control of Ad5PPE-l-3X in the BAEC cell line. Figure 3b is a photomicrograph illustrating GFP expression of AdSCMV in the BAEC line. As is clearly shown by these Figures, the PPE-1-3X promoter is more active in endothelial cells. These results clearlv indicate that the 3X element does not detract from the endothelial specificit}' of the PPE-1 promoter. Relative activities of the PPE-1 and PPE-1-3X promoters in cell culture are presented in example 6 hereinbelow.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 In-vitro assay ofpro-apoptotic activity of the p5 5 gene<br>
Following sub cloning of P55 (TNFRl, GenBank accession number M75866) into PACPPE3X (containing the PPE-1-3X promoter), and into PACCM\’, co-transfection of these plasmids and GFP (pEGFP-Cl vector; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). was performed as described hereinabove. Briefly, the gene was subcloned downstream to the PPE-1 promoter (instead of the luciferase gene) into the NotI restriction site, by T4 DNA ligase, following by transforming it into DH5a competent cells. Twenty four hours post-transfection, small and rounded apoptotic cells were visually discernible from normal cells. Electron microscopy of cells transfected with the pro-apoptotic plasmids showed typical appearance of apoptosis, confirming the visual evaluation.<br><br>
Under the control of the PPE-1-3X promoter, apoptosis was induced by p55 only in endothelial cells (Figure 4), whereas the CMV promoter did not show any cell specific activit&gt;'. Luciferase under the control of PPE-1-3X did not induce apoptosis in any tested cell lines. These results indicate that by employing the PPE-1-3X promoter, it is feasible to induce apoptosis specifically in endothelial cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Hypoxia responsive element (HRE) can enhance target gene expression in<br>
Iiypoxic sensitive endotlielial cells<br>
Hypoxia is an important regulator of blood vessels' tone and structure. It has also been shown to be a potent stimulus of angiogenesis (in both ischemic heart diseases and cancer (Semenza, G.L. et al. (2000) Adv Exp Med Biol.; 475:123-30; Williams, KJ, (2001) Breast Cancer Res. 2001: 3;328"31 and Shimo, T. (2001) Cancer Lett. 174;57-64). Further, hypoxia has been reported to regulate the expression of many genes including erythropoietin, VEGF, glycolytic enzymes and ET-l. These genes are controlled by a common ox)’gen-sensing pathway, an inducible transcription complex termed hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The HIF-l complex mediates transcriptional responses to hypoxia by binding the cis acting hypoxia responsive element (HRE) of target genes. The HRE is a conserved sequence located in the promoters of few genes that respond to hypoxia including: VEGF, Nitric Oxide Syntase-2, erytropoietin and others including endothelin-1, ET-l. The ET-l promoter contains an inverted hypoxia response element at position -118 bp upstream of the transcription start site, the element contain 7 base pairs and is located between the GATA-2 and API sites 5' GCACGTT 3’ - 50 base-pairs-(SEQIDN0:5.)<br>
The preproendothelin-l (PPE-1) promoter contains an hypoxia responsive element (HRE) that has the potential to increase its expression in the hypoxic microenviroment of tumor or ischemic tissues, thus making it "tumoral<br><br>
tissue specific" and/or 'ischemic tissue specific". In order evaluate the actual function of this tIRE, assays of the PPE-1 promoter and PPE'1-3X promoter in conjunction with a Luciferase or GFP reporter gene and delivered by an adenoviral vector were undertaken.<br>
Luciferase activity under the control of the PPE-1 promoter or the PPE-loX promoter was compared in B.AEC cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (0,5% Oi for 16h). The Luciferase activity under the control of PPE-1 promoter was 5 times higher when exposed to hypoxia (Figures 5 and 6). Further, the Luciferase activity under the control of PPE-1-3X promoter v*'as 2.5 times higher under hypoxic conditions. In summary, introduction of the 3X element into the PPE 1 promoter is till capable of increasing expression levels of a downstream gene in response to hypoxia, even though the normoxic levels of expression with the PPE-1-3X gene are higher than those observed with the unmodified PPE-1 promoter.<br>
EX4MPLE 6<br>
Further evaluation of PPE-1-3X and<br>
PPE'l promoter activity in endothelial cell lines<br>
Figure 7 summarizes the results from B2B, HUVEC and BAEC transfection experiments using pPPE-1/Luciferase and pPPE-l-3X/Luciferase. Higher Luciferase expression (30, 8.5 and 1.5 times more) was observed under the control of the PPE-1-3X promoter than under the PPE-1 promoter in B2B, HU\’C and BAEC, respectively. These results confirm those presented hereinabove and ser\’e to establish that PPE-1-3X is well suited to directing high level expression specifically to endothelial cells. In the context of future in-vivo delivery, the higher levels of expression achieved with the PPE-1-3X construct translate into administration of smaller amounts of DNA. This, in turn, will sen’e to increase specificity even further.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7 Efficiency, specificity and stability ofAdSPPE-lLiic in-vivo<br>
In order to confirm that the endothelial specificity of expression observed in examples 2 tlirough 6 was not an artifact of cell culture, the Ad5PPE-l/Luciferase construct was injected into C57BL/6 mice as described hereinabove in 'Tissue gene expression in normal mice". As in the in-vitro studies’ Ad5CMV/Luciferase w’as employed as a negative control.<br>
FolloAving injection of adenoviral vectors, the specific activit}' and stabilit&gt;' of Luciferase in vascularized and non-vascularized tissues was assayed. Results are summarized in Figure 8 (Luciferase expression relative to expression in liver) and Table 2 (Luciferase expression as a percentage of total expression in the body). As expected, in AdSCMV/Luciferase treated mice most of the Luciferase activity (&gt;80% of the total body expression) was found in the liver. Luciferase activity controlled by the PPE-1 promoter was lower in the liver (37-54% of the total body expression). The PPE-1 derived expression was much higher in the aorta (23-33% of the total body expression 5 and 14 days post injection, respectively), compared to AdSCMV/Luciferase. treated mice (up to L8% of total body expression; Table 2). These results confirm the endothelial specificity observed in cell culture. It should be remembered that the liver is a highly vascularized organ. Therefore examination of cellular expression within organs was undertaken, as detailed hereinbelow.<br>
Table 2 - Luciferase expression in organs 5 and 14 days post injection of<br><br><br><br>
Figures 30A and 30 B demonstrate the absolute Luciferase activity (light units/fig protein) in the aortas (A) and livers (B) of the 110 injected mice. Luciferase activity' was measured 1 (n=13), 5 (n=34), 14 (n-32X 30 (n’20) and 90 (n=l l)days post injection. The results in the aorta represent the promoters (PPE-1 or CMV) activity mostly in endothelial cells, while the results in the livers represent their activity mostly in hepatocytes.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Assays of efficiency, specificity and stability ofAdSPPE-l in-vivo- in<br>
BALB/C mice<br>
The experiments of example 7 were repeated in 12 week old BALB/C mice (n=10 for each group) in order to demonstrate that the observed results were not an artifact of a particular strain of animals.<br>
Because Absolute results with the adenoviral vectors were lower in BALB/C mice than in C57BL/6 mice, the Luciferase expression is expressed as percentage of the total Luciferase activity in all tissues.<br>
The highest relative Luciferase expression 5 days post injection was observed in the spleens of Ad5PPE-l (90.9%), and in the livers of Ad5CMV (86.2%) injected mice, A significant increase in the relative Luciferase activity in the aortas of Ad5PPE-l injected mice 14 days post injection (32.9%), compared to its activity five days post injection (1.75%) was also obsen’ed (Figures 31A and 3 IB; AdSPPE-lLuc-open bars; Ad5CMVLuc-black bars).<br><br>
These results confirm that regardless of mouse strain, the tissue specificity of the PPE-1 promoter is sufficiently strong to effectively eliminate hepatoc&gt;te expression, despite preferential uptake of injected DNA by hepatocytes.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Cellular localization of gene delivered by AdSPPE-l in-vivo<br>
In order to ascertain cellular expression sites of the gene expressed by PPE'l in-vivo. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) delivered by the adenoviral vector Ad5PPE-l-GFP was used. AdSClNWGFP (Quantum, Canada) was used as non-endothelial-cell-specific negative control. Five days post-intravenous injection the mice were sacrificed and their tissues were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy-<br>
In the mice injected with AdSCNfVGFP vector, most of the expression was detected in the hepatocytes, and no expression was detected in endothelial cell in the liver (Figure 9A). In sharp contrast, AdSPPE-l-GFP injected mice (Figure 9B), showed no expression in hepatoc’’tes, but significant expression in endothelial cells in the blood vessels of the liver. Similar results were obtained in other tissues where practically all the PPE-1 derived expression was detected in the endothelium, while none of the CMV derived expression was endothelial. These results indicate endothelial specificity is preserved even within an organ containing endothelial and non-endothelial cells. This finding has important implications for prevention of angiogenesis in growing tumors.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 Assays of efficiency and endothelial specificity ofAd5PPE-l-3XLiic and<br>
Ad5PPE-l'3X GFP inMtro<br>
In order to detennine the relative efficacy of Ad5PPE-l and Ad5PPE-l-3X in driving expression of the reporter genes Luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cells, specific activity in endothelial cells was tested in-vip’o<br><br>
using cell hnes described hereinabove. AdSCMVLuc and AdSCMVGFP were employed as non-tissue specific controls. AdSPPE-lLuc and Ad5PPE-IGFP were employed to ascertain the relative change in expression level caused by addition of the 3X sequence.<br>
Results, summarized in Figures 10 and 11, indicate that Luciferase activities under the control of the PPE-l-SX promoter were 5-10 times higher in EC lines (Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells - BAEC) compared to activity in non-endothelial cells - Rat Insulinoma - RIN, HeLA, HePG2 and nonnal skin fibroblasts (NSF) (figures 10 and 11).<br>
Figure 10 shows Luciferase activity as light units/jig protein in B2B, BAEC and RIN cells transduced by Ad5PPE-lLuc, Ad5PPE-U3XLuc, and AdSCIvIVLuc Highest Luciferase expression was observed in RIN cells transduced by AdSCMVLuc, however this construct was poorly expressed in BAEC and B2B cells. The next highest level of Luciferase expression was obsen’ed in BAEC cells transduced by Ad5PPE-l-3XLuc. Ad5PPE'lLuc was expressed at lower levels in BAEC cells. In the B2B cell line Ad5PPE-lLuc and Ad5PPE-I-3XLuc were expressed at nearly identical levels.<br>
Overall, Luciferase activity in the endothelial cell lines under the control of PPE-loX promoter was 23 times higher than under the control of PPE-1 promoter and 23-47 times higher than under the control of the CMV promoter at the same infection conditions (moi=10). This is despite the fact that Luciferase expression in non-endothelial RIN cells was 3000 times higher under the control of the CMV promoter (figure 10).<br>
In order to establish that PPE-l and PPE-L3X are inactive in other non-endothelial cell lineages HeLA, HepG2, NSF cell lines were transduced. BAEC was employed as an endothelial control. Figure 11 shews Luciferase activity as light units/’ig protein in HeLA, HepG2, NSF and BAEC cells transduced by AdSPPE-lLuc, Ad5PPE-L3XLuc and AdSCMVLuc. Transduction with AdSCMVLuc caused high levels of Luciferase expression in HeLA, HepG2 and NSF cells. These cell lines failed to express Luciferase under the control of<br><br>
PPE-1 and expressed Luciferase at low levels with the PPE-1-3X promoter. As expected, BAEC cells transduced with Ad5PPE-lLuc or Ad5PPE-l-3XLuc exliibited high Luciferase expression.<br>
Taken together these results indicate that introduction of the 3X sequence into the PPE-1 promoter caused higher levels of expression in endothelial cell lines while preventing unwanted expression in non-endothelial cells.<br>
Addition of the 3X sequence to the PPE-1 promoter also increased levels of Green fluorescent protein expression in EC lines (Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells - BAEC) as indicated in Figures 12 A-C which depicts GFP expression in BAEC transduced by moi=K No expression of GFP was observed using a C’'‘V promoter in this experiment.<br>
In Figure 12, panel A indicates Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP transduced cells, panel B indicates Ad5PPE-lGFP transduced cells and panel C indicates Ad5CM\’GFP. Again, introduction of the 3X sequence into the PPE-1 promoter significantly increased expression of the reporter gene. This result indicates that the abilit}' of the 3X sequence to function as an endothelial specific enhancer is not a function of the downstream gene being transcribed.<br>
Moreover, Ad5PPE-l-3X-GFP and Ad5PPE-lGFP transduction resulted in no GFP expression in non-endothelial cells SMC, HelA, HePG2 and normal skin fibroblasts (NSF) compared to the high expression under the CMV promoter as summarized in Figures 13-16,<br>
Figure 13 shows GFP expression in SMC transduced by moi==l of either Ad5PPE-1’3XGFP (panel A) or Ad5CM\’GFP (panel B), While high level GFP expression resulted from AdSCMVGFP transduction, no GFP expression resulted from transduction with Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP transduction.<br>
Figure 14 shows results of a similar experiment conducted in HeLa cells. As in the previous figure, panel A indicates cells transduced with Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP and panel B indicates cells transduced with AdSCMVGFP. Again, while high level GFP expression resulted from AdSCMVGFP transduction, no<br><br>
GFP expression resuhed from transduction with Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP transduction.<br>
Figure 15 shows results of a similar experiment conducted in HepG2 cells. As in the previous figure, panel A indicates cells transduced with Ad5PPE-I(3X)GFP and panel B indicates cells transduced with AdSCMVGFP. Again, while high level GFP expression resulted from Ad5CMVGFP transduction, no GFP expression resulted from transduction withAd5PPE-l-3XGFP.<br>
Figure 16 shows results of a similar experiment conducted in NSF cells. As in the previous figure, panel A indicates cells transduced with Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP and panel B indicates cells transduced with Ad5CMVGFP. Again, while high level GFP expression resulted from AdSCMVGFP transduction, very low GFP expression resulted from transduction with AdSPPE-l-BXGFP.<br>
These results, taken together, indicate a high level of endothelial specificit}' and a high level of endothelial expression is obtained by using a modified PPE-1 promoter containing the 3X sequence of SEQ ID NO.: 7,<br>
EXAMPLE 11 Cellular localization of a reporter gene delivered by AdSPPE-l-SX in-vivo<br>
In order to determine the cellular localization pattern of a reporter gene expressed under the control of the PPE-1-'3X promoter in-vivo’ Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP and Ad5PPE-lGFP were injected into mice as described hereinabove. Five days post-intravenous injection, the mice were sacrificed and their tissues were analyzed by a fluorescent microscopy.<br>
Significantly higher GFP activity was obsen’ed in the endothelial cells of the liver, kidney and spleen blood vessels of Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP injected mice compared to the Ad5PPE-lGFP injected mice. Figures 17A and B show representative results.<br>
Figure 17A shows low level GFP expression in endothelial cells lining a blood vessel of a mouse injected with the Ad5PPE-lGFP.  Figure 17B shows<br><br>
the much higher level of GFP expression resulting from addition of the 3X sequence to the construct.<br>
Despite the high expression in the lining of the blood vessels, no expression was detected in the hepatocytes, glomeruli, epithelial cells and splenocytes (Figures 18 and 19).<br>
Figure 18 shows representative results from kidney tissue of injected mice. AdSCMVGFP injected mice (Figure l8A),Ad5PPE-lGFP (Figure 18b) and Ad5PPE-l"3XGFP (Figure 18C) injected mice all exhibited low GFP activity in kidney cells. In figure 18B, slightly higher GFP expression is visible in the blood vessel wall (indicated by arrow).<br>
Figure 19 shows representative results from spleen tissue of injected mice. AdSCMVGFP injected mice(Figure 19A), Ad5PPE-lGFP injected mice (Figure 19B) and Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP injected mice (Figure 19 C) all exhibited low level GFP activity in cells of the spleen. Higher GFP activity is visible in the blood vessels of Ad5PPE*l-3XGFP injected mice (indicated by arrow).<br>
These results confirmed that both the PPE-1 and the PPE-l-SX promoter are endothelial cell specific in-vivo. They further suggest that activity of both promoters was limited in non-proliferating endothelial tissue (i.e. blood vessels of healthy organs. Therefore, assays in a tumor angiogenic model were undertaken.<br>
EXAMPLE 12 Assays oflheAd5PPE-l construct in tumor neovascularization in-vivo<br>
In order to ascertain the ability of AD5PPE to specifically direct expression of a reporter gene to angiogenic blood vessels in a tumor, the murine LLC model (described hereinabove in materials and methods) was employed.<br>
In a one experiment, Luciferase expression in tumor neovascularization was tested five days post systemic injections of AdSPPE-lLuc or Ad5CMVLuc (lO’’fu/ml each).<br><br>
In this experiment, systemic injection of Ad5CN4\’uc to both primai7 and metastatic tumor models resulted in minimal expression in the primary tumor or in the metastatic lung. This level of expression was similar to the minimal expression of Luciferase directed by CMV in naive normal lungs (Figure 35; black bars; n=12). In sharp contrast, under the control of PPE-1 promoter (Figure 35; open bars; n=9), the highly angiogenic lung metastases were associated Luciferase activity which was about 200 times higher than the Luciferase activity in the poorly-vascularized primary tumor and the naive lungs.<br>
The Luciferase expression in non-metastatic tissues such as the liver, kidney, heart and pancreas was minimah The expression level in the aorta was about 30% of the levels in the metastatic lungs.<br>
In an additional experiment in the LLC model Ad5PPE-lGFP and Ad5CMVGFP constructs were employed to localize reporter gene expression in the primary tumor and metastatic lungs,<br>
AdSPPE'lGFP injected mice, showed high levels of GFP specific expression in the blood vessels of the primary tumor (Figure 36C), although no expression was detected in the tumor cells themselves. This observation is consistent with the results of the LLC cell culture model presented in example 20. In lung metastases, high levels of GFP expression were detected in both big arteries and small angiogenic vessels of the metastatic foci (Figure 36A). No expression was detected in the normal lung tissue. The endothelial cell localization was demonstrated by co-localization of the GFP expression (Figure 16A) and the CD31 antibody immuno-staining (Figure 16B). In striking contrast, in Ad5CMVGFP injected mice, no GFP activity was detectable in both the primary tumor and lung metastasis.<br>
Figure 36C illustrates GFP expression in blood vessels of a primar&gt;' tumor after intra tumoral injection of Ad5PPE-lGFP. Figure 36D is a phase contrast image of the same filed as panel C illustrating the tumor and its blood vessels.<br><br>
These results indicate that while PPE-1 does not drive higli level expression in tumor cells per se, the promoter does drive high level expression in vascular endothelia within the tumor, especially in rapidly proliferating angiogenic vessels.<br>
Intra-tumor injection of AdSCMV into primaiy subcutaneous tumor model resulted in high Luciferase expression in the tumor tissue and moderately levels of expression liver (10% of the amount expressed in the tumor; Figure 42). No expression was detected in the metastatic lungs. On tht other hand, v/hen injected intra-tumoral, Luciferase expression under the control PPE-1 promoter resulted in similar Luciferase levels of expression in the primary tumor and the metastatic lungs and no expression was detected in the liver.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 Assays of the Ad5PFE-l construct in a carcinoma cell culture system<br>
In order to assay the efficiency of Ad5PPE-l and AdSCMV to drive Luciferase expression in cancerous cells, the D122-96 Lewis Lung Carcinoma cell line was employed,<br>
In-viti’o transduction at varying multiplicities of infection (moi) was performed. The results indicate that both adenoviral vectors are able to transduce the Luciferase gene to these cells (Table 3). Nevertheless, Luciferase activity directed by the PPE-1 promoter was much lower in the LLC cells than the activity detected in endothelial cells, 50 vs. 1000-2500 light units/’ig protein, respectively.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Assay of the effect of the 3X sequence in tumor angiogenic blood vessels in-<br>
vivo<br>
In order to ascertain the effect of the 3X sequence on the PPE-1 promoter in angiogenic blood vessels, the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) metastases model (described hereinabove in material and methods) was employed. Five days post IV injection of 10’’ infectious units of Ad5PPE-IGFP, Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP or AdSCMVGFP, the mice were sacrificed and their tissues were analyzed as described in material and methods.<br>
Figures 20 A-D summarize the GFP expression in metastatic lungs of control mice injected with Saline (Figure 20A)5 mice injected with AdSCMVGFP (Figure 20 B), mice injected with Ad5PPE-lGFP (Figure 20 C) and mice .injected with Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP (Figure 20D). Anti.CD31 immunostaining (Figures 20C' to 20D') confirm the location of the GFP expression in each metastatic tissue. The results show that while no GFP expression v/as detected in control - saline injected mice (Figure 20A), there was a slight expression around the epithelial bronchi of the CMV injected mice, but not in the angiogenic blood vessels of the metastatic lung of these mice (Figure 20B). Low GFP expression was observed in metastatic lungs of Ad5PPE-lGFP injected mice (Figures 20C and 20C'), while high and specific expression was observed in the new blood vessels of Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP injected mice (Figure 20D and 20 D').<br>
These results explain the apparent disparity between the in-vivo results of example 10 and the in-viti-o results of examples 2, 3 and 6. Both the PPE-1 and the PPE-1-3X promoter are endothelial specific. However, the 3X sequence greatly increases the level of expression in rapidly proliferating endothelial tissue, such as newly forming blood vessels in a growing tumor.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Effect of the SX element on the PPE-l promoter<br>
hi tumor angiogenic blood vessels<br>
In order to study the effect of the 3X element of the present invention on efficacy and specific activity of the PPE-1 promoter in tumor angiogenic blood vessels, the LLC metastases model was employed. Five days post i.v. injection of \0’’ pfli/ml of Ad5PPE-lLuc, Ad5PPE-l-3XLuc, AdSCMVLuc, AdSPPE-1 GFP, Ad5PPE-1-3X-GFP or AdSCNfVGFP, the mice were sacrificed and their tissues were analyzed for Luciferase or GFP expression as described hereinabove.<br>
Figure 37 is a histogram comparing Luciferase expression in normal<br>
lungs versus that in metastatic lungs after systemic injection of Ad5PPE-l-<br>
3Xluc, Ad5PPE-lLuc or AdSCMVLuc.  Experimental	groups	were<br>
AdSCMVLuc (n=7; black bars), Ad5PPE-lLuc (n-6;gray bars)  and AdSPPE-l-3XLuc (n=13; brown bars). Activity is expressed as light units/’g protein.<br>
Luciferase expression under the control of the PPE-1-3X promoter was 35 fold greater in the metastatic lungs relative to its activity in normal lungs and 3.5 fold higher than expression driven by the PPE-1 promoter without the 3X element (p
In order to localize reporter gene expression to specific cell types, GFP constructs were employed. Figure 39 shows the GFP expression (Figure 39A) in metastatic lungs of Ad5PPE-l-3XGFP injected mice. Inmiuno-staining by CD31 antibody (Figure 39B) confirm the location of the GFP expression in the new blood vessels. No GFP expression was detected in control - saline injected mice. Low level expression around the epithelial bronchi of the CMV injected mice, but not in the angiogenic blood vessels of the metastatic lung.  In<br><br>
summar)’ these results indicate that large increases in expression level resulted from introduction of a 3X element into Ad5PPE-l constructs and that this increased expression was specific to the angiogenic blood vessels of tumors. Potentially, the observed effect may be coupled with the hypoxia response described hereinabove to further boost expression levels of a sequence of interest.<br>
EXAMPLE 16 Further characterization ofthePPE-l hypoxia response<br>
In order to further characterize the effect of hypoxia on the murine PPE-1 promoter activity, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were transfected by a DNA plasmid (pEL8; Figure 26A). The pEL8 plasmid contains the murine PPE-1 promoter (L4kb) (red), the luciferase gene (1842 bp), the SV40 poly A sites and the first intron of the endothelin-1 gene, all termed the PPE-1 promoter cassette was digested and extracted by BamHI restriction enzyme as described in material and methods. After transfection, cells were subjected to hypoxic conditions.<br>
Luciferase expression in transfected BAEC subjected to 18 hours of hypoxia (0.5% 02) was eight times higher than Luciferase expression in cells grown in a normoxic environment (Figure 21), Figure 21 shows that Luciferase activity (light units/|ig protein) in BAEC transfected by a plasmid containing the murine PPE-1 promoter was significantly higher when transfected cells were incubated in a hypoxic environment. Equivalent transfection efficiencies were confirmed by co-transfection with a p-galactosidase reporter vector and assays of LacZ activity.<br>
In order to determine whether murine PPE-1 promoter delivered by adenoviral vector is also up-regulated by hypoxia, BAEC were transduced by Ad5PPE-lLuc. AdSCMVLuc was used a non specific control in this experiment. Results are sunraiarized in Figure 22. Hypoxia Luciferase activity in BAEC transduced by AdSPPE-lLuc.  In stark contrast,  no significant<br><br>
difference between normoxia and hypoxia was detected in the Ad5CMV transduced cells (Figure 22).<br>
To understand whether the enhancement of the PPE-1 promoter activity is specific to endothehal cells, different cell lines (BAEC, B2B, CHO, RIN and Cardiac Myocytes) were transduced by Ad5PPB-l (moi=10) and were subjected to hypoxia (0,5% 02) or normoxia environment. Results are summarized in figure 23. Luciferase expression was slightly increased in B2B cells and significantly increased in BAEC cells cultured in a hypoxic environment. Luciferase expression in other cell lines was reduced by the hypoxic enviromnent, compared to normoxia. These results confirm that hypoxic induction of the PPE-1 promoter occurs primarily in endothelial cell lineages.<br>
EXAMPLE 17 Effect of the 3X sequence on the PPE-l hypoxia response<br>
In order to ascertain the effect of the 3X sequence on the PPE-1 hypoxia response, BAEC were transduced by Ad5PPE-lLuc and Ad5PPE-l(3X)Luc, Following transduction, the BAEC cells were incubated either in a hypoxic or a normoxic environment as detailed hereinabove. Results are summarized in Figure 24. Luciferase expression using the Ad5PPE-lLuc construct significantly increased (seven folds) in response to hypoxia (2578 in hypoxia and 322-1 in noniioxia). In contrast, the Ad5PPE-l(3X)Luc construct exhibited only 1.5 fold increase in response to hypoxia (from 2874,5 in normoxia to 4315 in hypoxia conditions). These results indicate that the high normoxic level of expression observed when the 3X sequence is added to the PPE-1 promoter serves to mask the hypoxic response to some extent.<br>
EXAMPLE 18 Assays of the PPE-1 response to hypoxia in a transgenic mouse model<br>
In order to examine the murine PPE-1 promoter activity in tissues subjected to regional     hypoxia/ischemia,    mPPE-1 -Luc    transgenic    mice,    described<br><br>
hereinabove in materials and methods, were employed. The mice were induced to regional hind limb ischemia as previously described (Couffmhal T. et al. (199S) Am- J- Pathol. 152;1667-1679). In brief, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg, IP). Unilateral ischemia of the hind limb was induced by ligation of the right femoral artery, approx. 2 mm proximal to the bifurcation of the saphenous and popliteal arteries. To verify the induction of functional change in perfusion, ultrasonic imaging was perforated on days 4 and 14 by Synerg)' ultrasound system (GE) equipped with a 7.5 MHz transducer and angiographic software. Animals were housed under conventional conditions for up to 18 days.<br>
Luciferase expression was assayed 2, 5, 10 and 18 days post ligation in the ischemic muscle, in the normal non-ligated muscle, in the liver, lung, and aorta.<br>
Results, sununarized in Figure 25, show that while no significant difference was detected in the liver, lung and aorta during the days post ligation, Luciferase gene expression increased after the femoral ligation in both in the normal non-ligated and in the ischemic muscle. While peak Luciferase expression in the ischemic muscle was detected five days post ligation, peak Luciferase expression in the non-ligated muscle was detected ten days post femoral artery ligation. This indicates that the hypoxic response of the PPE-1 promoter is functional in an in-vivo system. Luciferase expression in the nonischemic muscle did not change during the days tested, compared to its expression in tlie control non-operated tissue (da}’0). In contrast, Luciferase expression in the ischemic muscle was significantly higher on day 5 than at other time points.<br>
On day 5, PPE-1 driven expression of Luciferase was 2.5 times higher than in control non-operated mice and compared to the ischemic muscle in days 10 and 18 (Figure 40).<br>
Expression of Luciferase in other non-ischemic tissues including liver, lungs and aorta of the transgenic mice subjected to regional ischemia revealed<br><br>
no significant changes within 18 days post ischemic induction in the Luciferase expression in these tissues (Figure 41).<br>
Further, these results confimi that Luciferase expression was higher in tissues containing a high percentage of endothelial tissue (lung and aorta) than in those tissues containing a low percentage of endothelial tissue (liver and nonischemic muscle).<br>
EXAMPLE 19 Effect of level of cellular proliferation on AdSPPE-lLiic activity in<br>
endothelial cells<br>
In order to ascertain the effect of level of cellular proliferation on efficiency and specific activity of AdSPPE-lLuc, an angiogenic model of endothelial cells (BAEC), was tested in-vitro. Transduced BAEC were either induced to quiescence by serum deprivation or grown in 10% FCS for normal proliferation. Briefly, cells were transduced for 48 hours either as quiescent cells - 72 hours post serum deprivation or as proliferating cells - in normal media (10% FCS). Luciferase activity is expressed as hght unit/|xg protein, to normalize for the difference in cell amount. The results presented are an average of triplicate test from four representative independent experiments.<br>
Luciferase expression under the control of PPE-1 promoter (open bars; Figure 28) was 4 times higher in normal proliferating BAEC than in quiescent cells, and 25 times higher in normal proliferating BAEC than Luciferase expression under control of the CM\’ promoter (Black bars; Figure 28). Further, in proliferating cells, the activit}' under the control of PPE-1 promoter was 10 times higher than that under the CMV promoter control.<br>
In order to simulate angiogenic conditions in-vitro, Ad5PPE-lLuc activit)’ was tested in BAEC induced to rapid proliferation by addition of 40 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Activity under these conditions was compared activity in normal proliferating cells and quiescent cells as described hereinabove, Luciferase expression in BAEC induced to cell<br><br>
proliferation with VEGF was 44 times higher than in nonnal proliferating cells, and 83 times higher than in quiescent cells (Figure 29).<br>
Together, these experiments indicate that the level of activity of a sequence of interest under transcriptional control of the PPE-l Promoter is a function of the level of cellular proliferation, with rapid proliferation causing higher levels of expression.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
Assays of the PPE-1 promoler in Atherosclerosis induced mice<br>
In order to test the efficiency and specificity of the Ad5PPE-l vector in<br>
atherosclerotic blood vessels,   lO'‘pfli/ml of the viral vectors were systemically<br>
injected to   6 month old ApoE deficient mice (Plump, A.S. et al. Cell; 1991;<br>
71:343-353.),<br>
As ApoE deficient mice age, they develop high cholesterol values and extensive atherogenic plaques with no induction of lipid reach diet. Figure 32 is a picture of an aorta dissected from an ApoE deficient mouse colored by Sudan - W. Note that the thoracic aorta contains less red stained atherosclerotic lesions while the abdominal region is highly atherosclerotic. (Figure 32 adapted from Imaging of Aortic atherosclerotic lesions by 125I'HDL and 125I-BSA. A. Shaish et al, Pathobiology - submitted for publication).<br>
Figure 33 summarizes Luciferase expression observed 5 days post systemic injections of Ad5PPE-lLuc (open bars; n=12) and AdSCMVLuc (black bars; n=12) to ApoE deficient mice. Results are presented as absolute Luciferase expression in the thoracic area that contains less atherosclerotic lesion, and the abdominal aorta that is rich atherosclerotic lesion.<br>
Luciferase expression controlled by the PPE-1 promoter was 6 fold higher in the highly atherosclerotic abdominal, and 1.6 fold higher in the slightly atherosclerotic thoracic aorta as compared to expression under the control CKfV promoter.<br><br>
No significant difference was ohser\’ed between the two aorta regions in the Ad5PPE-lLuc injected mice, while higher Luciferase expression was observed in thoracic aorta of the Ad5CMVLuc injected group compared to low expression in the abdominal aorta that contain lesion.<br>
These results indicate that while a constitutive promoter (CMV) has a tendency to shut down in areas where atherosclerosis is most severe, the PPE-1 promoter is relatively unaffected by disease progression.<br>
EXAMPLE 21 Assays of the PPE-I promoter in a wound healing model<br>
In order to test the Ad5PPE-l constructs efficiency and specific activity in directing Luciferase expression to healing wound blood vessels, a murine wound healing as described hereinabove in Material and Methods w’as employed.<br>
As in other experiments, Ad5CN4VLuc was used as a non-tissue specific control. Luciferase activity under the PPE-1 promoter (Figure 34; open bars) control was higher both in the normal (6.8±3,2) and in healing wound region (5±1.6) compared to the activity observed under the CMV control (Figure 34; black bars).<br>
Because both the CMV and PPE-1 promoter exhibited reduced expression levels in the healing wound, these results are difficult to interpret. Despite this unexpected observation, it is clear that the PPE-1 promoter drives higher levels of expression than the CMV promoter in both normal and healing tissue. The presence of necrotic scar tissue may account for the reduced expression levels observed with both promoters in the healing wound.<br>
