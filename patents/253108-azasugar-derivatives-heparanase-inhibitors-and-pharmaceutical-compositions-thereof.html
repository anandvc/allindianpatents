				<td>The subject of the invention is azasugar derivatives, inhibitors of heparanases, their<br>
preparation, compositions containing them and their<br>
therapeutic application..<br>
Heparanases are enzymes of the<br>
endoglucuronidase type which have as substrate<br>
polysaccharides of the heparin/heparan sulphate (HS)<br>
family. Type I and II heparanases are known (McKenzie<br>
et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (2000), Vol.<br>
276, p. 1170-1177) . They hydrolyse specifically β-l-&gt;4<br>
type bonds between a saccharide unit of the<br>
D-glucuronic acid type and a saccharide unit of the<br>
D-glucosamine type and release HS fragments of about 10<br>
to 20 saccharide units (Pikas, D.S. et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., (1998), Vol. 2 73, p. 18770-18777.). Heparanases<br>
break down in the same manner the polysaccharide chains<br>
of heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Vlokavsky<br>
and Friedmann, J. Clin Invest., (2001), Vol. 108, p.<br>
341-347). HSPGs consist of a core protein to which<br>
linear HS chains are covalently attached (Kjellen et<br>
al., Annu. Rev. Biochem., (1991), Vol. 60, p. 443-475).<br>
HSPGs are ubiquitous macromolecules. Like HSs, HSPGs<br>
are present at the surface of numerous cell types and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Kjellen et al.,<br><br>
(1991), ibid.} Bernfield et al., Annu Rev. Biochem.,<br>
(1999), Vol. 68, p. 729-777; David et al., FASEB J.,<br>
(1993), Vol. 7, p. 1023-1030; Lozzo et al., Annu. Rev.<br>
Biochem. (1998), Vol. 67, p. 609-652). The ECM, a major<br>
component of the connective tissues of vertebrates and<br>
invertebrates, occupies the extracellular environment.<br>
It envelops the organs and surrounds the endothelia, in<br>
particular the capillary endothelia (Wight et al.,<br>
Arteriosclerosis, (1989), Vol. 9, p. 1-20), thus<br>
playing a role of maintenance and of barrier for<br>
protection of the organs and endothelia (McKenzie et<br>
al.r Biochem. J.; 2003; Vol. 373, p. 423-435). The ECM<br>
is also a key modulator involved in various cellular<br>
mechanisms, in particular cell differentiation and<br>
repair (Folkman et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., (1992),<br>
Vol. 313, p. 355-364).<br>
Heparanase inhibiting compounds have been<br>
described in the prior art. For example, International<br>
Patent Application WO 02/0600374 describes benz-1,3-<br>
azole derivatives, International Patent Application<br>
WO 03/074516 relates to phthalimidecarboxylic acid and<br>
benzoxazole derivatives, International Patent<br>
Application WO 04/013132 describes furanthiazole<br>
derivatives or International Patent Application<br>
WO 04/046123 describes benzoxazole, benzothiazole and<br>
benzimidazole derivatives.<br>
The synthesis of short-chain (2 units)<br><br>
azasugar derivatives in which the nitrogen atom<br>
replaces the oxygen atom at the 5-position has been<br>
described in Takahashi et al., Chem. Lett., (1994),<br>
Vol. 11, p. 2119; Takahashi et al., Tetrahedron,<br>
(2001), Vol. 57, p. 6915-6926). However, their<br>
activities in vivo have not been identified.<br>
Azasugar derivatives with a single unit, of<br>
the following formula:<br><br>
have already been described (Patent US 6,583,158;<br>
Ichikawa et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., (1998), Vol. 12 0,<br>
p. 3007) .<br>
A need still exists to find and to develop<br>
products having good activity in vitro and in vivo.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that<br>
synthetic azasugar derivatives exhibit good activity as<br>
heparanase inhibitors. The present invention therefore<br>
relates to novel azasugar derivatives which are<br>
heparanase inhibitors. These novel compounds exhibit<br>
good heparanase inhibiting activity.<br>

-	R16 and R17 have the same definition as R3 as<br>
defined above,<br>
provided, however, that when X and R each,represent a<br>
hydroxyl radical, Y does not represent a hydrogen atom,<br>
and it being understood that the number of saccharide<br>

In the context of the present invention:<br>
a (C1-C5)alkyl radical represents a linear or<br>
branched saturated aliphatic radical which may<br>
contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. By way of<br>
examples, there may be mentioned methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl<br>
radicals and the like,<br>
an -O-aralkyl radical represents an alkyl group as<br>
defined above but substituted with an aromatic<br>
radical which may itself carry substituents. By<br>
way of example, there may be mentioned<br>
p-methoxybenzyl, phenylmethyl, phenylethyl,<br>
phenylpropyl and the like,<br>
a (C1-C3)alkylene radical represents a divalent<br>
alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
The expression pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt is understood to mean azasugar derivatives of the<br>
invention, an azasugar derivative in which one or more<br>
of the -COO- or/and -SO3- functional groups are<br>
ionically linked to a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
cation. The preferred salts according to the invention<br>
are those whose cation is chosen from alkali metal<br><br>
cations and still more preferably those whose cation is<br>
Na+ or K+.<br>
In its principle, the method for preparing<br>
the compounds according to the invention uses mono-,<br>
di- or oligosaccharide parent synthons prepared as<br>
previously reported in the literature and chosen taking<br>
into account in particular the orthogonality of the<br>
protecting groups. Reference may be made in particular<br>
to EP 300099, EP 529715, EP 621282 and EP 649854 and to<br>
C. van Boeckel, M. Petitou, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.<br>
Engl., (1993), Vol. 32, p. 1671-1690. These synthons<br>
are then coupled to each other so as to provide a<br>
completely protected equivalent of a compound according<br>
to the invention. This protected equivalent is then<br>
converted to a compound according to the invention<br>
using methods well known to the person skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
As the compounds of the invention<br>
additionally contain an azasugar (or substituted<br>
piperidine) unit, their synthesis requires the<br>
preparation of a precursor of this unit carrying<br>
protecting groups compatible with subsequent couplings<br>
to mono-, di- or oligosaccharides. The azasugar<br>
precursors are prepared according to methods described<br>
in the literature. Reference may be made in particular<br>
to the book "Iminosugars as Glycosidase Inhibitors",<br>
AE Stiitz, Wiley-VCH, 1999.<br><br>
When the synthons necessary for the assembly<br>
of the chain are available, couplings of these synthons<br>
with each other are carried out. In the coupling<br>
reactions mentioned, a "donor" synthon, activated on<br>
its anomeric carbon, reacts with an "acceptor" synthon,<br>
possessing at least one free hydroxyl.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
the preparation of the compounds of formula (I),<br>
characterized in that: in a first step, a completely<br>
protected, equivalent of the desired compound (I) is<br>
prepared; in a second step, the negatively charged<br>
groups (carboxylates, sulphonates) and the free<br>
hydroxyls are introduced and/or unmasked.<br>
The synthesis of the precursor is carried out<br>
according to reactions well known to persons skilled in<br>
the art using in particular the methods of saccharide<br>
synthesis (G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, (1996), Vol. 52, p.<br>
1095-1121; WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443) according to<br>
which a glycosidic bond donor oligosaccharide is<br>
coupled with a glycosidic bond acceptor oligosaccharide<br>
to give another oligosaccharide whose size is equal to<br>
the sum of the sizes of the two reactive species. This<br>
sequence is repeated until the desired compound of<br>
formula (I) is obtained. The structure of the desired<br>
final compound determines the nature of the chemical<br>
entities used in the various steps of the synthesis, so<br>
as to control the stereochemistry and the<br><br>
regioselectivity, according to rules well known to<br>
persons skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are<br>
obtained from their completely protected polysaccharide<br>
precursors using in general the following sequence of<br>
reactions:<br>
release and substitution of the functional groups<br>
which have to be converted to N- and/or O-<br>
sulphonate groups;<br>
release of the other functional groups and<br>
optional assembly of the fragments with each<br>
other, for example by a reductive amination<br>
reaction.<br>
The release of the carboxylic acid functional groups<br>
may be carried out at various stages of this method.<br>
The compounds of the invention may naturally<br>
be prepared using various strategies known to persons<br>
skilled in the art for saccharide and organic<br>
synthesis.<br>
The method described above is the preferred<br>
method of the invention. However, the compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be prepared by other methods well known<br>
in sugar chemistry which are described for example in<br>
"Monosaccharides, Their chemistry and their roles in<br>
natural products", P.M. Collins and R.J. Ferrier, J.<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1995 and in G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron,<br>
(1996), Vol. 52, p. 1095-1121.<br><br>
The protecting groups used in the method for<br>
preparing the compounds (I) are those commonly used in<br>
sugar chemistry, for example in Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, TW Greene, PGM Wuts, John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, New York, 1999.<br>
The protecting groups are advantageously<br>
chosen for example from acetyl, halomethyl, benzoyl,<br>
levulinyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl, optionally<br>
substituted trityl, carbamate, tetrahydropyranyl,<br>
allyl, pentenyl, tert-butyldimethyl silyl (tBDMS) or<br>
trimethylsilylethyl groups.<br>
The activating groups are those<br>
conventionally used in sugar chemistry according to for<br>
example G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, (1996), Vol. 52, p.<br>
1095-1121. These activating groups are chosen for<br>
example from imidates, thioglycosides, pentenyl-<br>
glycosides, xanthates, phosphites or halides.<br>
The method described above makes it possible<br>
to obtain compounds of the invention in the form of<br>
salts. To obtain the corresponding acids, the compounds<br>
of the invention in the form of salts are brought into<br>
contact with a cation exchange resin,in acid form.<br>
The compounds of the invention in the form of<br>
acids may then be neutralized with a base in order to<br>
obtain the desired salt. For the preparation of the<br>
salts of the compounds of formula (I), it is possible<br>
to use any inorganic or organic base which gives<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the compounds of<br>
formula (I). Sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium<br>
hydroxide is preferably used as base. The sodium and<br>
calcium salts of the compounds of formula (I) are the<br>
preferred salts.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have<br>
been the subject of biochemical and pharmacological<br>
studies. The following nonlimiting tests illustrate the<br>
present invention.<br>
The following terms are defined:<br>
PET: polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
AM: acetoxymethyl,<br>
DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium,<br>
EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,<br>
Tris: tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,<br>
AT: antithrombin III,<br>
nkat: nanokatal = enzymatic unit of measurement (given<br>
by the manufacturer) representing the quantity of<br>
substrate catalysed per unit of time.<br>
1. Evaluation of the activity of the heparanase<br>
inhibitors in an enzymatic system (determination of the<br>
IC50 values of the compounds according to the invention)<br>
The heparanase activity is demonstrated by<br>
its. capacity to degrade fondaparinux. The concentration<br>
of fondaparinux is determined by means of its anti-<br>
factor Xa activity.<br>
A. Materials and methods<br><br>
The heparanase is produced by Sanofi-<br>
Synthelabo (Labege, France).<br>
The reagents for assaying factor Xa are<br>
marketed by Chromogenix (Montpellier, France).<br>
Increasing concentrations of a compound<br>
according to the invention, an inhibitor of heparanases<br>
(varying dilutions: from 1 nM to 10 µM) are mixed at a<br>
fixed heparanase concentration (for each batch,<br>
preliminary experiments make it possible to determine<br>
the enzymatic activity which is sufficient for the<br>
degradation of 0.45 µg/ml of added fondaparinux) . After<br>
5 minutes at 3 7°C, the mixture is exposed to<br>
fondaparinux and left for 1 hour at 37°C. The reaction<br>
is stopped by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes. The<br>
residual fondaparinux concentration is finally -measured<br>
by adding factor Xa and its specific chromogenic<br>
substrate (Ref. S2222).<br>
The various mixtures are produced according<br>
to the following procedure:<br>
a) Reaction mixture<br>
50 µl of sodium acetate buffer (0.2 M,<br>
pH 4.2) are mixed with 50 µl of fondaparinux<br>
(0.45 µg/ml) and 59 µ1 of a heparanase solution. The<br>
mixture is incubated for 1 hour at 3 7°C and then for<br>
5 minutes at 95°C. 100 µl of the reaction mixture are<br>
then mixed with 50 µl of 50 mM Tris buffer containing<br>
175 mM NaCl, 75 mM EDTA, pH 14. The pH thus passes from<br><br>
4.2 to 7.<br>
"The anti-factor Xa activity of fondaparinux<br>
is measured in the following manner:<br>
b) Assay of the anti-factor Xa activity of<br>
fondaparinux<br>
100 µl of the solution obtained in step a)<br>
are mixed with 100 µl of AT (0.5 µ/ml) . The mixture is<br>
kept for 2 minutes at 37°C and 100 µl of factor Xa<br>
(7 nkat/ml) are then added. The mixture is kept for<br>
2 minutes at 3 7°C and 10 0 µl of chromogenic substrate<br>
(Ref.: S2222) (1 mM) are then added. The mixture is<br>
kept for 2 minutes at 37°C and 100 µl of acetic acid<br>
(5 0%) are then added.<br>
The optical density is read at 405 nm.<br>
A percentage inhibition is determined<br>
relative to control without inhibitor. A curve of the<br>
percentage inhibition makes it possible to calculate an<br>
IC50.<br>
B. Results<br>
The compounds according to the present<br>
invention have IC50 values of between 10 nM and 10 /zM.<br>
For example, compound No. 27 has an IC50 of<br>
11+4 nM (mean + SD, done on two assays).<br>
2. Effect of the heparanase inhibitors on the invasion<br>
of HT1080 tumour cells<br>
The effect of the compounds of formula (I),<br>
inhibitors of heparanases, was tested in vitro on the<br><br>
invasion of HT1080 tumour cells.<br>
A. Materials and methods:<br>
a)	Cell culture:<br>
The cells derived from human fibrosarcomas,<br>
HT1080 (ATCC CCL-121) are cultured in a DMEM medium<br>
(Ref.: GIBCO 1196O-044) containing 5% Foetal Calf<br>
Serum, glutamine (2 mM) (Ref.: GIBCO 2503O-024), sodium<br>
pyruvate (1 mM) (Ref.: GIBCO 1136O-039) and<br>
nonessential amino acids (1X) (Ref.: GIBCO 1114O-035),<br>
on collagen coated flasks (Becton Dickinson 75 cm2; Ref.<br>
354523), to 50 to 80% confluence.<br>
b)	Cell invasion test<br>
The measurements of invasion of the HT1080<br>
cells are carried out on a Becton Dickinson falcon HTS<br>
Fluoroblock Multiwell Insert System kit in 24-well<br>
plates (Ref.: 351158). These measurement chambers give<br>
the cells the conditions which make it possible to<br>
evaluate their invasive properties in vitro.<br>
The kit is composed of a plate combined with<br>
culture inserts containing a PET membrane pierced with<br>
8 micron pores on which a uniform Matrigel Matrix<br>
(Becton Dickinson; Ref. 354230) layer is deposited.<br>
Matrigel is a soluble basal membrane<br>
extracted from the EHS (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm) tumour<br>
which, by virtue of its composition, forms, upon<br>
solidifying, a structure equivalent to a basal<br>
membrane.<br><br>
The Matrigel layer blocks the pores of the<br>
membrane, thus blocking the migration of the<br>
noninvasive cells across the membrane. By contrast, the<br>
invasive (tumour or nontumour) cells will be capable of<br>
becoming detached and of invading the Matrigel layer<br>
before migrating across the membrane.<br>
The quantification of the cell migration is<br>
carried out by labelling with calcein AM (Molecular<br>
Probes C-3100). The fluorescent signal emitted is<br>
measured with the aid of a Perkin Elmer Wallac VICTOR 3<br>
reader and may be directly correlated with the number<br>
of cells which have invaded the Matrigel gel. By<br>
comparing them with controls made in the same<br>
experiment as the products studied (response in the<br>
presence of 0% and 5% foetal calf serum), it is<br>
possible to determine a percentage inhibition of cell<br>
invasion in the presence of the products.<br>
B. Results<br>
A series of independent determinations<br>
(varying from 2 to 4) made it possible to show that at<br>
a concentration of between 1 nM and 10 jiM, the<br>
compounds according to the invention inhibit cell<br>
invasion on average by a percentage of between 8 and<br>
60%.<br>
For example, a series of four independent<br>
determinations made it possible to show that 10 /iM of<br>
compound No. 2 0 inhibit cell invasion on average by a<br><br>
percentage equal to 40.3 ± 8.3% (mean ± standard<br>
deviation).<br>
Furthermore, compound No. 2 0 has a dose-<br>
dependent effect on cell invasion.<br>
Indeed:<br>
at a concentration of 0.3 µM, compound No. 20<br>
inhibits cell invasion by 26 ± 3%,<br>
at a concentration of 1 µM, compound No. 2 0<br>
inhibits cell invasion by 53 + 11%.<br>
These results demonstrate an increase in the<br>
inhibition of cell invasion as a function of the dose<br>
of compound No. 20.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the<br>
present invention therefore exhibit good affinity for<br>
heparanases and exhibit a heparanase inhibiting effect.<br>
It has been demonstrated in animals and in<br>
humans that the increase in the secretion of<br>
heparanases and cancerous progression are correlated<br>
(Goldschmit et al., PNAS, (2002), Vol. 99(15) , p.<br>
10031-10036). For example, a high heparanase level has<br>
been detected in the serum of animals having metastatic<br>
tumours (Vlodavsky et al., Isr. J. Med. Sci. (1988),<br>
Vol. 24(9-10), p. 464-470) or in the urine of patients<br>
suffering from cancer who have developed numerous<br>
metastases (Vlodavsky et al., Curr. Biol., (1997), Vol.<br>
7(1), p.43-51). Tumour biopsies have shown the same<br>
correlation (Vlodavsky et al., Isr. J. Med. Sci.,<br><br>
(1988), Vol. 24(9-10), p. 464-470). A correlation<br>
therefore exists between the increase in secretion of<br>
heparanases and the metastatic potential of tumour<br>
cells (Vlodavsky et al. , Invasion Metastasis, (1994),<br>
Vol.14, p. 29O-302; Nature Medicine, (1999), Vol. 5, p.<br>
793-802) .<br>
Heparanases, which are secreted by tumour<br>
cells, degrade the HSPGs and HS, which are major<br>
components of the ECM. The ECM thus perforated allows<br>
the tumour and metastatic cells to circulate and also<br>
allows the invasion of newly-formed blood vessels<br>
(angiogenesis) (Suzanne A. Eccles, Nat. Med., (1999),<br>
Vol. 5 (7),p. 793-809). Angiogenesis is a process for<br>
generating new capillary vessels from preexisting<br>
vessels or by mobilization and differentiation of bone<br>
marrow cells. Thus, both an uncontrolled proliferation<br>
of the endothelial cells and a mobilization of<br>
angioblasts from the bone marrow are observed in the<br>
new vascularization processes of tumours.<br>
Thus, heparanases represent relevant targets<br>
for therapies aimed at inhibiting the processes of<br>
invasion of cancer cells and of metastasization, on the<br>
one hand, and of angiogenesis, on the other. The<br>
expression cancer (or carcinoma) is understood to mean<br>
any malignant cell growth of the epithelium, present in<br>
the skin but also and especially in the wall of the<br>
organs and the appearance of metastatic tumour cells<br><br>
such as melanomas, mesothelioma, lymphoma, leukaemia,<br>
fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, mastocytoma, but also<br>
carcinomas affecting a tissue such as the colon, the<br>
rectum, the prostate, the lungs, the breasts, the<br>
pancreas, the intestine, the kidneys, the ovaries, the<br>
uterus, the cervix, the bladder, the liver and the<br>
stomach. The carcinomas infiltrate the adjacent tissues<br>
and spread (metastasize) to other distant organs, for<br>
example the liver, the lungs, the brain or the bones. A<br>
compound possessing a heparanase inhibiting activity,<br>
such as the compounds of the invention, may therefore<br>
be useful for the treatment of such cancers (Fang J et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (2000), Vol. 97(8), p.<br>
3884-3889; Kondraganti et al., Cancer Res., (2000),<br>
Vol. 60 (24) , p. 6851-6855), and in particular<br>
colorectal, prostate, lung, breast, pancreatic, kidney,<br>
bladder and ovarian cancer.<br>
The p75 receptor, a receptor for molecules of<br>
the neurotrophin (NT) family, has been identified as<br>
being a representative marker of the phenomenon of<br>
metastasization in the brain. It has furthermore been<br>
demonstrated that the secretion of NT involves an<br>
increase in the secretion of heparanases (Marchetti D.<br>
et al. J. Cell. Biochem., (2004), Vol. 91(1), p. 206-<br>
215). Thus, a compound possessing a heparanase<br>
inhibiting activity, such as the compounds of the<br>
invention, may therefore be useful for reducing<br><br>
metastasization in the central nervous system by<br>
inhibiting the action of the activation of the p75<br>
receptor (Marchetti D. et al., Pathol. Oncol. Res.,<br>
(2003) Vol. 9(3), p. 147-158 and Epub, (2003), Review;<br>
Walch ET. et al., Int. J. Cancer, (1999), Vol. 82 (1),<br>
p. 112-120; Menter DG. et al., Invasion Metastasis,<br>
(1994-95), Vol. 14 (1-6) , p. 372-384; Marchetti D. et<br>
al., Int. J. Cancer, (1993), Vol. 55 (4) , p. 692-699).<br>
The activity of heparanases on the HSPGs of<br>
the ECM also appears to be correlated with the onset of<br>
inflammatory.and autoimmune reactions (Vlodavsky et<br>
al., Invasion metastasis, (1994), Vol.. 4, p. 29O-302;<br>
Goldschmit et al., Med. Sci. (2002), Vol. 99 (15), p.<br>
10031-10036). The interaction of the platelets, the<br>
granulocytes, the B and T lymphocytes, the macrophages<br>
and the mastocytes with the ECM is associated with the<br>
degradation of the HSs by the heparanases (Vlodavsky et<br>
al., Invasion Metastasis, (1992), Vol. 12, p. 112-127)..<br>
Thus, a compound such as the compounds of the<br>
invention, possessing a heparanase inhibiting activity,<br>
may therefore be useful for the treatment of<br>
inflammatory diseases, in particular chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or<br>
IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), comprising two forms<br>
of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases: UC (ulcerative<br>
colitis) and Crohn's disease (CD) or autoimmune<br>
diseases.<br><br>
Other studies suggest that heparanases could<br>
play a role in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases<br>

Appl. Thromb. Hemost., (2001), Vol. 7(2), p. 131-140),<br>
such as post-angioplasty restenosis, diseases linked to<br>
the vascular complications of diabetes such as diabetic<br>
retinopathies, atherosclerosis (Atherosclerosis,<br>
(1999), Vol. 145, p. 97-10.6; J. Clin. Invest., (1997),<br>
Vol. 10 0, p. 867-874) or thromboembolic diseases and<br>
arterial thromboses. Thus, a heparanase inhibiting<br>
compound according to the invention may represent a<br>
therapy of choice in these pathologies.<br>
Moreover, heparanases are known to be<br>
involved in certain cases of renal insufficiency where<br>
the renal filtration and reabsorption functions may be<br>
impaired (FASEB J, (2004), Vol. 18, p. 252-263).. Thus,<br>
a heparanase inhibiting compound according to the<br>
invention may represent a therapy of choice in such<br>
pathologies.<br>
The HSPGs of the ECM also appear to play a<br>
role as major regulators of cell growth and activation<br>
via the modulation of growth factors, in particular of<br><br>
FGFs (Fibroblast Growth Factors). For example, the<br>
activity of heparanases involves the release of growth<br>
factors such as the FGFs, which stimulate in particular<br>
angiogenesis, and promotes tumour progression (Bashkin<br>
et al., Biochemistry, (1989), Vol. 28, p. 1737-1743).<br>
Thus, heparanases represent relevant targets for the<br>
treatment of diseases in which the FGFs are involved.<br>
In general, the FGFs are involved to a great<br>
extent via autocrine, paracrine or juxtacrine<br>
secretions in the phenomena of deregulation of the<br>
stimulation of the growth of cancer cells. Furthermore,<br>
the FGFs initiate tumour angiogenesis which plays a<br>
predominant role both on tumour growth and also on the<br>
phenomena of metastasization.<br>
Angiogenesis is a process for generating new<br>
capillary vessels from preexisting vessels or by<br>
mobilization and differentiation of bone marrow cells.<br>
Thus, both uncontrolled proliferation of the<br>
endothelial cells and mobilization of angioblasts from<br>
the bone marrow are observed in the processes of<br>
neovascularization of tumours. It has been shown in<br>
vitro and in vivo that several growth factors stimulate<br>
endothelial proliferation, and in particular FGF-1 or<br>
a-FGF and FGF-2 or b-FGF.<br>
a-FGF and b-FGF play for example an important<br>
role in the growth and the maintenance of prostate<br>
cells (Doll JA, et al., Prostate, (2001), Vol. 305, p.<br><br>
49-293.<br>
Several research studies show the presence of<br>
a-FGF and b-FGF and of their receptors (FGFRs) both in<br>
human breast tumour lines (in particular MCF7) and in<br>
tumour biopsies.<br>
Glioma cells produce a-FGF and b-FGF in vitro<br>
and in vivo and possess various FGF receptors at their<br>
surface.<br>
More recently, the potential role of<br>
proangiogenic agents, and in particular of FGFs, in<br>
leukaemias and lymphomas has been documented (Thomas DA<br>
et al., Acta Haematol, (2001), Vol. 207, p. 106-190).<br>
A correlation exists between the process of<br>
bone marrow angiogenesis and extramedullar diseases in<br>
CMLs (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia).<br>
The proliferation and migration of vascular<br>
smooth muscle cells contribute to the intimal<br>
hypertrophy of the arteries and thus plays a<br>
predominant role in atherosclerosis and in restenosis<br>
following angioplasty and endarterectomy. Studies in<br>
vivo show a local production of a-FGF and b-FGF after<br>
lesion of the carotid by balloon injury.<br>
Vascular disorders due to diabetes are<br>
characterized by an impairment of the vascular<br>
reactivity and of the blood flow, a hyperpermeability,<br>
an increased proliferative response and an increase in<br>
matrix protein deposits. More precisely, a-FGF and<br><br>
b-FGF are present in the preretinal membranes of<br>
patients with diabetic retinopathies, in the membranes<br>
of the underlying capillaries and in the vitreous<br>
humour of patients suffering from proliferative<br>
retinopathies.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic<br>
disease with unknown etiology. While it affects<br>
numerous organs, the most severe form of RA is a<br>
progressive synovial inflammation of the joints<br>
resulting in destruction. Angiogenesis appears to<br>
greatly affect the progression of this pathology. Thus,<br>
a-FGF and b-FGF have been detected in the synovial<br>
tissue and in the joint fluid of patients suffering<br>
from RA, indicating that this growth factor is involved<br>
in the initiation and/or the progression of this<br>
pathology. In AIA models (adjuvant-induced model of<br>
arthritis) in rats, it has been shown that the<br>
overexpression of b-FGF increases the severity of the<br>
disease whereas an anti b-FGF neutralizing antibody<br>
blocks the progression of RA (Yamashita et al. , J.<br>
Immunol., (2002), Vol. 57, pl 168-450; Manabe et al.,<br>
Rheumatol, (1999), Vol. 20, p. 38-714).<br>
Angiogenesis and inflammation are also major<br>
phenomena which occur in the processes involved in<br>
osteoarthritis leading to destruction of the joint<br>
accompanied by pain. Angiogenesis may also play a role<br>
in chondrocytic hypertrophy and ossification, thus<br><br>
contributing to the modifications of the joint (Bonnet<br>
CS et al, Rheumatology. (1) 7-16 2005) .<br>
IBDs (inflammatory bowel diseases) comprise<br>
two forms of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases: UC<br>
(ulcerative colitis) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBDs are<br>
characterized by an immune dysfunction resulting in an<br>
inappropriate production of inflammatory cytokines<br>
inducing the establishment of a local microvascular<br>
system. The consequence of this angiogenesis of<br>
inflammatory origin is an intestinal ischaemia induced<br>
by vasoconstriction. High circulating and local b-FGF<br>
levels have been measured in patients suffering from<br>
these pathologies (Kanazawa et al., American Journal of<br>
Gastroenterology, (2001), Vol. 28, p. 96-822; Thorn et<br>
al., Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology, (2000),<br>
Vol. 12, p. 35-408) .<br>
A compound possessing a heparanase inhibiting<br>
activity, such as the compounds of the invention, may<br>
therefore be useful for the treatment of diseases<br>
linked to an up regulation of the FGFs and/or of their<br>
receptors.<br>
By virtue of their low toxicity and their<br>
pharmacological and biological properties, the<br>
compounds of the present invention find application in<br>
the treatment of any carcinoma having a high degree of<br>
vascularization (lung, breast, prostate, oesophagus) or<br>
inducing metastases (colon, stomach, melanoma) or<br><br>
sensitive to a-FGF or to b-FGF in an autocrine manner<br>
or finally in pathologies of the lymphoma and leukaemia<br>
type. These compounds represent a therapy of choice<br>
either alone or in combination with a suitable<br>
chemotherapy or radiotherapy or in combination with a<br>
treatment with antiangiogenic agents. The compounds<br>
according to the invention also find application in the<br>
treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as<br>
atherosclerosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, in the<br>
treatment of diseases linked to the complications which<br>
appear following the fitting of endovascular prostheses<br>
and/or aortocoronary bypass surgery or vascular<br>
complications of diabetes such as diabetic<br>
retinopathies. The compounds of the invention also find<br>
application in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or IBDs.<br>
The products according to the invention also<br>
find application in the treatment of macular<br>
degeneration. A major characteristic of the loss of<br>
vision in adults is the neovascularization and the<br>
subsequent haemorrhages which cause considerable<br>
functional disorders in the eye and which result in<br>
early blindness. Recently, the study of the mechanisms<br>
involved in the phenomena of ocular neovascularization<br>
has made it possible to demonstrate the involvement of<br><br>
the proangiogenic factor in these pathologies.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be<br><br>
used in combination with one or more anticancer<br>
treatments, such as surgical treatments, radiotherapy<br>
or in combination with compounds which block<br>
angiogenesis. For example, the compounds of the<br>
invention may be used alone or in combination with<br>
another active ingredient such as cisplatine,<br>
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil,<br>
paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, vinblastine,<br>
vinorelbine, doxorubicin, tamoxifen, toremifene,<br>
megestrol acetate, anastrozole, goserelin, capecitabine<br>
and raloxifene or molecules having an antiangiogenic<br>
activity, for the treatment of cancer.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the<br>
subject of the present invention is therefore a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing, as active<br>
ingredient, a compound of formula (I) in free form or<br>
in the form of salts formed with a pharmaceutically. acceptable base or acid, according to the invention,<br>
optionally in combination with one or more inert and<br>
appropriate excipients.<br>
The said excipients are chosen according to<br>
the desired pharmaceutical dosage form and mode of<br>
administration: oral, sublingual, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosal,<br>
local or rectal.<br>
In each dosage unit, the active ingredient is<br>
present in quantities appropriate for the daily doses<br><br>
envisaged in order to obtain the desired prophylactic<br>
or therapeutic effect. Each dosage unit may contain<br>
from 0.1 to 100 mg of active ingredient, preferably 0.5<br>
to 50 mg.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention may be intended for oral, sublingual,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
intratracheal, topical, intranasal, transdermal,<br>
rectal, intraocular and vaginal administration. The<br>
unit forms for administration may be for example<br>
tablets, gelatin capsules, granules, powders, oral or<br>
injectable solution or suspensions, patches, injector<br>
pens and suppositories. For local administration,<br>
ointments, creams, lotions, eyedrops, gels, sprays and<br>
oil may be envisaged.<br>
The said unit forms contain doses which allow<br>
a daily administration of 1 to 100 mg of active<br>
ingredient per kg of body weight, according to the<br>
galenic form used.<br>
 To prepare tablets, a pharmaceutical vehicle<br>
which may be composed of diluents, such as, for<br>
example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and<br>
starch, ,,-and formulation adjuvants, such as binders<br>
(polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
and the like), glidants such as silica, and lubricants<br>
such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl<br>
tribehenate and sodium stearylfumarate, is added to the<br><br>
active ingredient, micronized or not. Wetting agents or<br>
surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulphate may also be<br>
added.<br>
The production techniques may be direct<br>
compression, dry granulation, wet granulation or hot-<br>
melt.<br>
The tablets may be uncoated, coated for<br>
example with sucrose, or coated with various polymers<br>
or other appropriate materials. They may be designed to<br>
allow rapid, delayed or prolonged release of the active.<br>
ingredient by virtue of the polymer matrices or the<br>
specific polymers used in the coating.<br>
To prepare gelatin capsules, the active<br>
ingredient is mixed with dry pharmaceutical vehicles<br>
(simple mixture, dry or wet granulation, or hot-melt),<br>
liquid pharmaceutical vehicles or semi-solid<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
The gelatin capsules may be hard or soft, film-coated or not, so as to have a rapid, prolonged or<br>

without limiting it. Before embarking on the<br>
preparation of these various examples, there is<br>
described below the preparation of compounds<br>
(PREPARATION) useful for the production of compounds of<br>
the invention or for other preparations.<br>
For the preparations and examples which<br>
follow, the following experimental, methods are used:<br>
METHOD 1<br>
Oxidation of the primary alcohols to an acid, and then<br>
conversion to a benzyl ester<br>
TEMPO (0.02 molar equivalent) and a saturated<br>
aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (4 1/mol)<br>
are added to a solution of compound to be oxidized<br>
(1 molar equivalent) in tetrahydrofuran (THF)<br>
(3.5 1/mol). After cooling to 0°C, Bromodan (2 molar<br>
equivalents) is added dropwise over 2 0 min. After 3 h<br>
of magnetic stirring, the reaction mixture is<br>
concentrated and the residue is dried by repeated<br>
evaporation of dimethylformamide (DMF) (4.95 1/mol).<br>
The crude compound thus obtained is used as it is in<br>
the next step.<br>
A solution of the preceding compound in<br>
dimethylformamide (13.1 1/mol) is treated at room<br>
temperature (l-15h) with benzyl bromide (10 molar<br>
equivalents), and potassium hydrogen carbonate (5 molar<br><br>
equivalents). The reaction mixture is concentrated and<br>
then the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate<br>
(35 1/mol), washed with water, dried (sodium sulphate)<br>
and concentrated. Column chromatography gives the<br>
expected benzyl ester.<br>
METHOD 2<br>
Coupling to imidates catalysed by tert-butyldimethyl-<br>
silyl triflate<br>
A solution of tejrt-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
triflate in dichloromethane (0.1M, 0.15 mol per mole of<br>
imidate) is added, under argon, at -20°C, to a solution<br>
of the imidate and of the glycosyl acceptor in a<br>
dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture (1:2,<br>
22.5-45 1/mol) in the presence of 4 A molecular sieves.<br>
After 1O-45 minutes (TLC), solid sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate is added. The solution is filtered, washed<br>
with water, dried and evaporated to dryness. METHOD 3<br>
Method for saponification of the esters<br>
Hydrogen peroxide.(H2O2) at 3 0% (7.16 1/mol<br>
ester) and an aqueous 0.7N lithium hydroxide solution<br>
(2.3 mol per mole of ester) are successively added, at<br>
-5°C, to a solution of compound to be saponified in<br>
tetrahydrofuran (160 1/mol). After stirring for 1 h at<br>
-5°C, the reaction medium is placed for 4 h at 0°C and<br>
then stirred at room temperature until the esters have<br>
been consumed. The crude reaction product is then<br><br>
optionally purified on an LH-20 column.<br>
METHOD 4<br>
Sulphonation<br>
Triethylamine/sulphur trioxide complex (5 mol<br>
per hydroxyl functional group) is added to a solution<br>
in dimethylformamide (90 1/mol) of the compound to be<br>
sulphated. After 12 to 22 hours at 55°C, methanol or an<br>
aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution is added at<br>
0°C, and after stirring for 0.5-24 h at room<br>
temperature, the reaction medium is purified with the<br>
aid of an LH-2 0 column, or of two Sephadex" G-25 columns<br>
(eluted successively with a 0.2M aqueous sodium<br>
chloride solution, and then with water). The fractions<br>
containing the product are then concentrated under a<br>
high vacuum to give the desired product.<br>
METHOD 5<br>
Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ethers and/or of the<br>
benzyl esters<br>
A solution of the compound in glacial acetic<br>
acid/water/tert-butanol mixture is kept stirring for<br>
6-16 h (TLC) under a hydrogen atmosphere (3-15 bar) in<br>
the presence of 5 or 10% palladium on carbon<br>
(equivalent to 0.7-3 times the mass of the compound).<br>
After filtration, the solution is deposited at the top<br>
of a Sephadex G-25 column, eluted with 0.2M sodium<br>
chloride. The fractions containing the product are<br>
concentrated and desalted using the same column eluted<br><br>
lwith water. The final compound is obtained after<br>
freeze-drying.<br>
