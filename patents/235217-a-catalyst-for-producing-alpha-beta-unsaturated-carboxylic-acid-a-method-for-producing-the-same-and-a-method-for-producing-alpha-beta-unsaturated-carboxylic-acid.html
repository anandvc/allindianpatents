DESCRIPTION<br>
Catalyst for Producing α,β-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acid, Method for Producing thereof and Method for Producing α,β-Unsaturated Carboxylic<br>
Acid<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, a method for producing the catalyst and a method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid by using the catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Many of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids are industrially useful. For example, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid is being used in a considerable amount for the application such as a raw material of synthetic resins. Although examples include gas-phase oxidation and liquid-phase oxidation of isobutene and a method by way of acetone cyanohydrin as a method for producing methacrylic acid, there is not a specifically advantageous method and methacrylic acid has been industrially produced by these several methods.<br>
There has been many researches on a catalyst and a method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with molecular oxygen. Examples include a method in the presence of gold supported catalyst (Patent Document 1), a method using a palladium metal catalyst (Patent<br><br>
Documents 2 to 6) and a method using a molybdenum compound and a palladium catalyst (Patent Document 7).<br>
The catalysts disclosed in Patent Documents 2 to 7 contain palladium as a component of a catalyst, however, there is no description concerning particle diameter of palladium. Further, some of the catalysts disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 7 are supported on a carrier such as activated carbon, aluminum or silica. However, as for physical properties of these carriers, there is merely one description in Patent Document 1 as “it is preferable to use a hydrophobic carrier or a conventional carrier subjected to hydrophobic treatment”, and there are no other descriptions, in those documents, referring to physical properties of these carriers.

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br><br>
When the present inventors produced acrylic acid from propylene by using the catalyst produced according to the methods of Examples described in Patent Documents 1 to 7, it was found that by-products such as various polymers and oligomers were produced in large amount in addition to the by¬products described in Patent Documents 1 to 7 (for example, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, acetic acid and carbon dioxide). In Patent Documents 1 to 7, these polymers and oligomers were not captured, and hence, the actual selectivity to acrylic acid and the yield of acrylic acid in view of these by¬products were found to be lower than those described in Examples of Patent Documents 1 to 7, Consequently, the reaction performance obtained in the method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid in Patent Documents 1 to 7 was not sufficient yet, and hence, further improvement on this point has been desired.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst which can produce an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in good reaction performance, a method for producing the catalyst and a method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid by using the catalyst.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM<br>

The present inventors have also found that, when palladium is used as a component of a catalyst, the catalyst performance is considerably influenced by a particle diameter of palladium in the catalyst produced, and thus have completed the present invention.<br><br>

A method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid of the present invention is a method for producing an unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with molecular oxygen in the presence of the catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid of the above (i) or (ii). EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION (1) Catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid The catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid of the present invention (hereinafter, sometimes expressed as “catalyst1') is a catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and is the following:<br>
(i) A catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid, wherein a metal is supported on a carrier with a total pore volume of 0.40 to 1.50 cc/g as measured by nitrogen gas adsorption method; or (ii) A catalyst for producing an a-unsaturated carboxylic acid, wherein palladium with an average particle diameter in the range of 1 to 8 nm is supported on a carrier.<br>
By using the above-mentioned catalyst, an α,β-unjsaturated carboxylic acid can be produced through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-<br><br>
The catalyst of the present invention is a supported catalyst in which a metal is supported on a carrier, Hereinafter, a carrier and a metal, which can be used as the catalyst of the present invention, will be explained.<br>
(1-1) Carrier<br>
The kind of the carrier of the present invention is not particularly limited and typical carriers such as activated carbon, carbon black, silica, alumina, magnesia, calcia, zirconia and titania can be used. Among them, activated carbon or silica is preferably used. Activated carbon is generally produced through the processes of carbonization, granulation, activation, washing, drying and pulverization, and these producing processes are not particularly limited in the present invention. A carbonaceous material which is the raw material of activated carbon is not particularly limited either, and various raw materials such as coconut shell, coal, lignin and synthetic resin can be used. The process of activation is not particularly limited either, and water vapor, carbon dioxide, oxygen, phosphoric acid, phosphate and zinc chloride can be used for activation. The activated carbon after the activation process is washed with mineral acid, hydrochloric acid and water, if necessary, and dried to be put to use. Among impurities contained in the product activated carbon, it is preferable to keep the amount of chlorine as small as possible because chlorine sometimes causes bad effects on the catalyst performance. Therefore, an activated carbon produced by using zinc chloride or hydrochloric acid is preferably washed sufficiently to remove the contained chlorine. The shape of the activated carbon is not particularly limited either and the activated carbon having various shapes such as powder, sphere, pellet and fiber can be used. The BET specific surface area of the activated carbon is preferably 300 m2/g or more, particularly preferably<br><br>
600 m2/g or more, and preferably 4,000 m2/g or less, particularly preferably 2,500 m2/g or less.<br>
One embodiment of the catalyst of the present invention is to select and use a carrier with a total pore volume of 0.40 to 1.50 cc/g as measured by nitrogen gas adsorption method. By using such a carrier, an α,β-unsalurated carboxylic acid can be produced through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in high selectivity and high productivity. Hereinafter, the constitution of the above carrier and tt)e method for producing the carrier will be explained.<br>
In particular, to obtain a target product in high selectivity, it is preferable to select a carrier with a total pore volume of 0.40 to 0.80 cc/g. The total pore volume is more preferably 0.47 cc/g or more, further preferably 0.70 cc/g or less, and furthermore preferably 0.67 cc/g or less. By using a carrier which fulfills such requirements, a target product such as acrylic acid or methacryiic acid can be obtained in good selectivity with little formation of by-products. The selectivity of the target product is improved because selecting a smaller range within the aforementioned range of the total pore volume is supposed to suppress the formation of by-products such as oligomers. Further, in this case, a proportion of the pore volume of the mesopore having a pore size of from 2 nm through 50 nm to the total pore volume is preferably 40 % or less to the total pore volume, more preferably 35 % or less, furthermore preferably 30 % or less and particularly preferably 20 % or less. Further, the above proportion of the pore volume of the mesopore is preferably 5 % or more to the total pore volume, more preferably 7 % or more and furthermore preferably 9 % or more. In this case, in particular, when the total pore volume are the same, the carrier with<br><br>
lower proportion of the mesopore is supposed to have the tendency to form lesser amount of by-products such as oligomers, and hence, improves the selectivity. Further, the BET specific surface area of the carrier is preferably 600 m2/g or more, more preferably 800 m2/g or more, and preferably 2,000 m2/g or less, more preferably 1,500 m2/g or less.<br>
In particular, to obtain a target product in high productivity, it is preferable to select the carrier with a total pore volume of 0.70 to 1.50 cc/g. The total pore volume is more preferably 0.80 cc/g or more, furthermore preferably 0.90 cc/g or more, and more preferably 1.40 cc/g or less, furthermore preferably 1.30 cc/g or less. By using a carrier, which fulfills such requirements, a target product such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid can be obtained in good productivity with high activity of the catalyst. The productivity of the target product is improved because selecting a larger range within the aforementioned range of the total pore volume is supposed to make internal pore diffusion of reactants and products easy. Further, a proportion of the pore volume of the mesopore having a pore size of from 2 nm through 50 nm to the total pore volume is preferably 10 % or more to the total pore volume, more preferably 20 % or more, furthermore preferably 30 % or more and particularly preferably 40 % or more. Further, the above proportion is preferably 65 % or less, more preferably 60 % or less and furthermore preferably 55 % or less. In this case, in particular, when the total pore volumes are the same, the carrier with larger proportion of the mesopore is supposed to have the tendency to make internal pore diffusion easier, and hence, improves the production efficiency. Further, the BET specific surface area of the carrier is preferably 100 m2/g or more, more<br><br>
preferably 300 m2/g or more, and preferably 5,000 m2/g or less, more preferably 4,000 m2/g or less.<br>
The total pore volume, the pore volume of the mesopore having a pore size of from 2 nm through 50 nm and the BET specific surface area of the carrier are measured by, for example, Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer, TriStar 3000 (trade name), manufactured by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation.<br>
(1-2) Metal<br>
The metal to be supported on the carrier is not particularly limited as long as it functions as a catalyst of liquid-phase oxidation, however, noble metal is preferable, palladium or gold is more preferable and palladium is particularly preferable. The metal can be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds. Further, the metal may contain another metal which does not function as a catalyst of liquid-phase oxidation. The content of the metal which does not function as a catalyst of liquid-phase oxidation is preferably 50 atomic% or less from the viewpoint of catalyst activity.<br>
One embodiment of the catalyst of the present invention is a catalyst in which palladium with an average particle diameter in the range of 1 to 8 nm is supported on a carrier. By selecting palladium as a metal and controlling its average particle diameter to fall in the range of 1 to 8 nm, a catalyst which can produce an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid from an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in high yield can be obtained. The above-mentioned average particle diameter is preferably 1.2 nm or more, more preferably 1.4 nm or more and preferably 7 nm or less, more preferably 6 nm or less. When the average particle diameter of palladium is outside the above range, the activity of the catalyst containing the above palladium is liable to be<br><br>
lowered, and hence, the yield of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylie acid is liable to be lowered. At this time, the catalyst may contain a metal other than palladium, however, the content of the metal other than palladium is preferably 50 atomic% or less from the viewpoint of catalyst activity.<br>
The average particle diameter of palladium mentioned above means a value measured with palladium in the catalyst by transmission electron microscope, which is concretely calculated as follows.<br>
Print out an image of transmission electron microscope with the same magnification as that of the observation, and randomly sample 50 points of the palladium regions in the field of view and measure particle diameter of each palladium region; measure the particle diameter by assuming its shape to be circular because the shape of the palladium region is almost circular; and carry out these operations with 3 fields of view and average the measured values to obtain an average particle diameter.<br>
Here, the observation by transmission electron microscope is carried out with a magnification under which the measurement of a palladium particle diameter is possible.<br>
The average particle diameter of palladium in the catalyst varies depending on various conditions such as a kind of carrier and BET specific surface area of a carrier to be used, a kind of solvent and mixing ratio in the case of mixed solvent to be used in the preparation of the catalyst, a kind and concentration of a palladium compound which is a raw material of the catalyst, and temperature and time of reducing the palladium compound. In the present invention, it is necessary to control the average particle diameter of palladium in the catalyst to be obtained to fall in the above-mentioned range by properly selecting and setting these conditions.<br><br>

In the next place, a method for producing the above-mentioned catalyst for producing an a,j5-unsaturated carboxylic acid of the present invention will be explained.<br>
The method for producing the catalyst of the present invention is not particularly limited, however, it is preferable to select a method in which a metal compound is reduced by a reducing agent in the presence of a carrier. Concretely, the catalyst can be prepared, for example, by a liquid-phase reduction method in which a metal compound solution with dispersed carrier is prepared and a reducing agent is added to it to reduce the metal compound or by a gas-phase reduction method in which a carrier impregnated with a metal compound solution is dried and then subjected to reduction in a reducing atmosphere. Among them, the liquid-phase reduction method is preferable. Hereinafter, a method for producing the catalyst by the liquid-phase reduction method will be explained.<br>

These compounds can be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
Further, as these metal compounds, it is also preferable to use those which do not substantially contain chlorine as an impurity. More concretely, it is preferable that chlorine content in the metat compound is 1,000 ppm or less. In other words, it is preferable to use metal compounds which do not<br><br>
contain chlorine such as acetates, nitrates or bisacetylacetonato complexes. When palladium is selected as the metal, for example, palladium acetate, palladium nitrate or bisacetylacetonatopalladium can be suitably used.<br>
As the solvent to dissolve the metal compound, it is properly selected in view of solubility of the metal compound and the reducing agent and dispersibility of the carrier. Water, alcohols, ketones, organic acids, hydrocarbons or mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from these groups can be used. As the solvent, at least one organic solvent selected from the group consisting of alcohols, ketones and organic acids is preferable, and at least one organic solvent selected from the group consisting of organic acids having carbon number of 2 to 6, tertiary butanol and ketones having carbon number of 3 to 6 is more preferable.<br>
It is also preferable to use a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent because a catalyst with better performance can be prepared. When the mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent is used, a mixed solvent of water and at least one organic solvent selected from the group consisting of alcohols, ketones and organic acids is preferable. Among them, a mixed solvent of water and at least one organic solvent selected from organic acids is more preferable. As the organic acids, at least one organic acid selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, iso-butyric acid, n-valeric acid and iso-valeric acid is preferable. Among them, n-valeric acid or acetic acid is particularly preferable. In this case, the amount of water is not particularly limited, however, it is preferably 5 % by weight or more to the weight of the mixed solvent, more preferably 8 % by weight or more. In addition, the amount of water mentioned above is preferably 60 % by weight or less, more preferably 50 % by weight or less, furthermore<br><br>
preferably 40 % by weight or less. In the case of mixed solvent, it is preferable that the solvent is homogeneous, while it may be heterogeneous.<br>
A carrier and a metal compound are added to the above-mentioned solvent in a desired order or simultaneously to prepare a metal compound solution with dispersed carrier. Concentration of the metal compound is preferably 0.1 % by weight or more, more preferably 0.2 % by weight or “ more, particularly preferably 0.5 % by weight or more. Besides, concentration of the above metal compound is preferably 20 % by weight or less, more preferably 10 % by weight or less, furthermore preferably 7 % by weight or less and particularly preferably 4 % by weight or less.<br>
In the next place, a reducing agent is added to the metal compound solution with dispersed carrier to reduce the metal compound, to obtain a catalyst in which the metal is supported on the carrier.<br>
The reducing agent to be used is not particularly limited and any material can be used as long as it has the ability to reduce a metal in its oxidized state in the metal compound. For example, hydrazine, formaldehyde, sodium borohydride, hydrogen, formic acid, formates, alcohols and olefins can be used. Among them, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of formaldehyde, propylene, isobutylene, 1 -butene and 2-butene is preferable and formaldehyde, propylene or isobutylene is more preferable.<br>
When a gas such as propylene is used as the reducing agent, it is preferable to charge a metal compound solution with dispersed carrier in a pressure device such as autoclave and to pressurize the inside with the reducing agent to carry out reduction. The pressure is preferably 0.1 to 1.0<br><br>
MPa (gauge pressure; hereinafter, pressure is all expressed in gauge pressure).<br>
When the reducing agent is liquid or solid, reduction can be carried out by adding the reducing agent in a metal compound solution with dispersed carrier. In this case, the amount of the reducing agent is preferably 1 to 50 mols to 1 mol of the metal compound.<br>
Temperature of the system at the time of reduction and reducing time are different depending on a method of reduction, a carrier and a metal compound to be used, solvent, a reducing agent and the like and cannot be absolutely said. In the case of liquid-phase reduction method, reducing temperature is preferably -5 °C or higher, more preferably 0 °C or higher, furthermore preferably 15 °C or higher, and preferably 150 °C or lower, more preferably 100 °C or lower, furthermore preferably 80 °C or lower. Reducing time is preferably 0.1 hour or more, more preferably 0.25 hour or more, furthermore preferably 0.5 hour or more, and is preferably 24 hours or less, more preferably 4 hours or less, furthermore preferably 3 hours or less and particularly preferably 2 hours or less.<br>
After reduction, a catalyst in which the metal is supported on the carrier is separated from the dispersion. The method of separation is not particularly limited and, for example, filtration or centrifugation can be used. The catalyst thus separated is properly dried. The drying method is not particularly limited and various methods can be used.<br>
Concentration of the metal contained in the residual solution separated from the catalyst after reduction is preferably 10 mg/l or less. This amount can be adjusted by concentration of the metal compound before reduction, a reducing condition or the like. The presence of the metal in the<br><br>
solution can be easily confirmed by adding a reducing agent such as hydrazine, and the amount of the metal in the solution can be determined quantitatively with an elemental analysis such as ICP.<br>
The supported metal ratio of the catalyst is preferably 0.1 % by weight or more to the carrier before the metal is supported, more preferably 0.5 % by weight or more, furthermore preferably 1 % by weight or more and particularly preferably 4 % by weight or more. Besides, the supported metal ratio of the catalyst is preferably 40 % by weight or less to the weight of the carrier before the metal is supported, more preferably 30 % by weight or less, furthermore preferably 20 % by weight or less and particularly preferably 15 % by weight or less. The supported ratio can be obtained from weight of the carrier used in the preparation of the catalyst, weight of the metal in the metal compound and weight of the metal contained in the residual solution separated from the catalyst after reduction.<br>
The catalyst thus produced may be used for the reaction in the state of dispersion after washing with a solvent or in the state of isolated form by centrifugation or filtration.<br>
The catalyst may be activated previous to being served to liquid-phase oxidation. The method for activation is not particularly limited and various methods can be used. As the method for activation, a method of heating under reducing atmosphere in a flow of hydrogen is preferable.<br>
(3) A method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
In the next place, a method for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid through liquid-phase oxidation of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde by using the catalyst for producing an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid of the present invention thus obtained will be explained.<br><br>
Examples of the raw olefin of the liquid-phase oxidation include propylene, isobutylene and 2-butene. Examples of the raw α,β-unsaturated aldehyde include acrolein, methacrolein, crotonaldehyde (p-methylacrolein) and cinnamaldehyde (p-phenylacrolein). The raw olefin or the raw α,β-unsaturated aldehyde may contain a small amount of impurities such as a saturated hydrocarbon and/or a saturated lower aldehyde. <br>
In the case that an olefin is used as the raw material, the α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid to be produced in the liquid-phase oxidation has the same carbon skeleton as the original olefin.

(Analysis of a raw material and a product)<br>
Analysis of a raw material and a product was carried out by using gas chromatography. The conversion of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde; the selectivity to an a.p-unsaturateTJ aldehyde to be produced; the selectivity to a polymer/oligomer to be produced; the selectivity to an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid to be produced, and the yield and productivity of an ct,p-unsaturated carboxylic acid to be produced are defined as follows:<br>
The conversion (%) of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde = (B / A)x100;<br>
The selectivity (%) to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde = {C / B) x 100;<br>
The selectivity (%) to an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid = (D / B) x 100;<br>
The selectivity (%) to a polymer/oltgomer = (E / B) x 100;<br>
The yield (%) of an cc.p-unsaturated carboxylic acid = (D / A) x 100; and<br>
The productivity (g/(g-h)) of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid = F / (GxH)<br>
In the above formulae, A represents mol number of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde supplied; B represents mol number of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde reacted; C represents mol number of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde produced; D represents mol number of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid produced; E represents reduced mol number of a polymer and oligomer produced based on an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is calculated by dividing total weight (unit: g) of a polymer<br><br>
and oligomer produced by molecular weight of an olefin or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde supplied; F represents weight (unit: g) of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid produced; G represents weight {unit: g) of a metal contained in a catalyst used; and H represents reaction time (unit: hour). Further, in the case of liquid-phase oxidation reaction of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, C/B is 0.<br>
(Measurements of physical properties of a carrier)<br>
Measurements of pore volume and pore size distribution of a carrier were carried out with fixed volume method based on nitrogen gas adsorption method by using Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer, TriStar 3000 (trade name), manufactured by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation. The pore size measurable by this method is in the range of about from 1 to 100 nm, and all the pore volumes and pore size distributions described in the present invention were calculated based on changes in the quantity of nitrogen adsorbed (adsorption isotherm) according to the direction of raising the relative pressure (adsorption equilibrated pressure / saturated vapor pressure).<br>
In the above measurement, total pore volume per unit weight of a carrier and BET specific surface area were measured by using t-plot method. Further, pore volume of pores having a pore size of from 2 nm through 50nm (mesopore) was calculated by using BJH method, and a proportion of the mesopore to the total pore volume was calculated.<br>

and concretely, calculated as follows. Print out an image of transmission electron microscope with the same magnification as that of the observation, and randomly sample 50 points of the palladium regions in the field of view and measure particle diameter of each palladium region; measure the particle diameter by assuming its shape to be circular because the shape of the palladium region is almost circular; and carry out these operations with 3 fields of view and average the measured values to obtain an average particle diameter.<br><br>
