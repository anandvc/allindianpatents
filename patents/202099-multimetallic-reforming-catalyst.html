A MULTIMETALLIC REFORMING CATALYST COMPRISING PLATINUM AND TIN, THE PREPARATION AND THE<br>
APPLICATION THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to a multimetallic hydrocarbons conversion catalyst which has the dual-functions of acidity and hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, and the preparation process thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to a multimetallic reforming catalyst comprising platinum and tin and the preparation process thereof<br>
Catalytic reforming is one of the most important technologies in the petroleum processing, and the main object thereof is to produce gasoline with high octane number, aromatics with wide applications, and hydrogen with low price. At present, the reforming catalysts widely used in industry are mostly bimetallic reforming catalysts such as Pt-Re, Pt-Sn catalysts. It is shown by research that, compared with Pt-Re catalysts, Pt-Sn catalysts have better low pressure stability, and higher aromatics selectivity,  have  no  necessity to  be pre-sulfurized,   and  are  more appropriate for moving bed reforming process. The acidity function in the bimetallic catalysts for isomerization is generally provided by porous acidic   oxide   supports   such   as   alumina   and  halogens,   and   the hydro genation-dehydrogenation function is generally provided by Group Vin metal components such as platinum or palladium. The incorporation of the second metal component. Re or Sn, can greatly improve the stability of the catalyst and reduce the content of the noble metal, platinum.<br>
Several competing reactions take place during the catalytic reforming procedure. These reactions include dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes to aromatics, dehydroisomerization of alkylcyclopentanes to aromatics, dehydrocyclization of acyclic hydrocarbons to aromatics, hydrocracking of paraffins to lighter hydrocarbons less than C3, dealkylation of alkylbenzenes, and isomerization of paraffms. In these reactions, the yield of gasoline would decrease due to the formation of hght paraffin gases from hydrocracking; the coking reaction would increase the deactivation rate of the catalyst; and the frequent regeneration of the catalyst would<br><br>
increase the operatmg cost. Therefore, it is always the object of persons skilled in the art to develop a reforming catalyst and process with high selectivity and low carbon deposit rate, wherein the addition of the third or the forth metal component into the bimetallic catalyst is one of the widely used modifying means in the art.<br>
USP 3915845 discloses a multimetallic catalyst composition for hydrocarbon conversion, comprising 0.01-2.0 wt% of a Pt Group metal, 0.01-5.0 wt% of germanium, 0.1-3.5 wt% of a halogen and a lanthanide compound, wherein the atomic ratio of lanthanide element/Platinum Group metal is 0.1-1.25. In the catalyst, the Pt Group metal is present as elemental metal state, while the other metals are present as oxide state. The lanthanide elements used are lanthanum, cerium or neodymium.<br>
USP 4039477 discloses a hydrotreatment catalyst modified with lanthanide metals and the use thereof Said catalyst comprises a refractory metal oxide, a Pt Group metal, Sn and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Y, Th, IT, Pr, Ce, La, Nd, Sm, Dy and Gd. This patent improves the activity stability of the catalyst by incorporating lanthanide metals into the catalyst and improves the selectivity of the lanthanide-containing catalyst by suppression of the cracking activity due to the presence of tin. In a specific embodiment, the C5+ yield in the conversion of hexanes on a Pt-Sn-Ce containing catalyst with a Ce/'Pt weight ratio of 0.37 is greater than that of a Pt-Sn contaming catalyst.<br>
USP 6059960 discloses a Pt-Sn multimetallic reforming catalyst containing lanthanide series, wherein the incorporated lanthanide components are EIL Yb, Sm, or a mixture of Eu and Yb, and more than 50% of the lanthanide metals in the catalyst is a present as EuO. When the composition of the catalyst is Pt-Sn-Eu, the relative activity and selectivity' are better when the atomic ratio of Eu/F1t is between 1.3 and 2.0, The selectivity of the catalyst will be lowered when said ratio is less than 1.3. The activity of the catalist will be greatly lowered when the atomic ratio of Eu.'Pt is higher than 2.0.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a lanthanide-modified Pt=Sn reforming catalyst with high activity, high selectivity and good activity stability<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing the catalyst described above.<br>
The inventors have found that the bimetallic reforming catalyst<br>
modified by cerium and europium can improve the selectivity and anti-<br>
carbon depositing ability of the catalyst, and thereby increase the liquid<br>
yield of the reforming reaction and prolong the lifetime of the catalyst In<br>

Said catalyst support, which is generally a porous adsorptive material and has a specific surface area of 30-500 m2/g, is selected from refractory inorganic oxides. The porous support should have uniform composition and is refractory under the operating conditions. The term uniform composition" used herein means that the support is not layered and has no concentration gradient of the intrinsic components. If the support is a mixture of two or more refractory materials, these materials have a relative constant content or a uniform distribution throughout the whole support.

The alumina powder may be made into various forms such as sphere, sheet, granular, strip, or trefoil.<br><br>
The aforesaid spherical support can be shaped by the oil-ammonia-drop method or hot oil-drop method. The strip or trefoil support can be prepared by the conventional extrusion shaping method.<br>
The apparent bulk density of said refractory inorganic oxide is 0.4-1.0 g/ml, the mean pore diameter thereof is 20-300 A, the pore volume thereof is 0.2-1.0 ml/g, and the specific surface area thereof is 100-500 m^/g.<br>
The process for preparing the catalyst according to the present invention comprises separately incorporating the Group IVA metal, Eu, and Ce into the inorganic oxide support, then incorporating an element of the Group VIII metal, preferably Pt. Drying and calcining are needed after each metal component is incorporated.<br>
In the preparation of the catalyst, the Group IVA metal, Eu and Ce should be firstly incorporated, and their incorporation order may be optional. The Group IVA metal may be incorporated firstly, and then Eu and Ce are incorporated, or vice versa. Eu and Ce can be incorporated simultaneously or separately. However, calcination is preferably carried out after each metal component has been incorporated to ensure a firm combination between the incorporated component and the support.<br>
The Group lYA metal component may be incorporated into the catalyst by any means to attain a uniform distribution. Co-prccipitation with the porous support, ion exchange, or impregnation may be used for incorporation. The impregnation is to impregnate the support with the solution of a soluble compound of the Group FVA metal and fill or disperse the solution throughout the whole porous carrier material. Suitable soluble compounds of the Group IVA metals are oxides, chlorides, nitrates, or alkoxides thereof such as stannous bromide, staimous chloride, stannic chloride, pentahydrate of stannic chloride; germanium dioxide, germanium tetraethoxide, germanium tetrachloride, lead nitrate, lead acetate, or lead chlorate. Stannic chloride, germanium tetrachloride, or lead chlorate are preferred, since a part of halogens can be incorporated by the above-mentioned chlorides together with the metal components. In addition, the Group IVA metal components can also be incorporated during the preparation of the support.<br><br>
Cerium and europium in the catalyst can be incorporated in any suitable manner known to those skilled in the art, such as co-precipitation, co-gelation, co-extrusion with the porous support, or ion exchange with the gelled support, etc. The preferred way is to add corresponding hydrated oxides or oxyhalides of cerium and europium and carry out co-gelation or co-precipitation during the preparation of the support, and then dry and calcine the solid. The suitable lanthanum compounds which may form a soluble sol or dispersible sol are lanthanum trichloride or lanthanum oxide.<br>
Another preferred method of incorporating cerium and europium<br>
involves utilization of a soluble compound of cerium and europium in<br>
solution to impregnate the porous support. The suitable solvents for<br>
formulating the impregnation solution comprise alcohols, ethers, acids,<br>
wherein inorganic acids such as HCl, HNO3, and the like, organic acids<br>
such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, citric acid and the like are prefeaed.<br>
The soluble compounds used for impregnating the support are metal salts,<br>

chlorides,  fluorides,  organic  alkylates,  hydroxides,  oxides,  wherein<br>
cerium nitrate, europium nitrate, cerium chloride, europium chloride,<br>
cerium oxide, or europium oxide are prefenred. Eu and Ce can be<br>
incorporated   into   the   support   simultaneously   or   separately.   The<br>
incorporarion of Eu and Ce can be proceed either before, after, or during<br>
the   incorporation   of the   Group   VIII  metal,   preferably  after  the<br>
incorporation of the Group VIII metal.<br>
The Group VIII metals in the catalyst are noble metals components, which can be incorporated into the support in any suitable manner, such as co-precipitation, ion exchange, or impregnation, etc. The preferred method involves the utilization of a soluble, decomposable compound of the Group VIII metals to impregnate the support. The unlimited examples of suitable water-soluble compounds or complexes of the Group VHI metals are: chloro-platinic acid, chloro-iridic acid, chloro-palladic acid, ammonium chloro-platinate, bromo-platinic acid, platinum trichloride, platinum tetrachloride hydrate, platinum dichloro-carbonyl dichloride, dinitrodiamino-platinum,     sodium    tetranitropIatinate(II),     palladium<br><br>

Chlorine-containing compounds of Pt, Ir, Rh, or Pd suoh as chloro-piatinic acid,   chloro-iridic acid, chloro-palladic acid, or rhodium trichloride hydrate are preferred. Hydrochloric acid or the  like  acids  such as  hydrofluoric acid can be  added  into  the impregnation solution during the process of supporting platinum to .facilitate the incorporation of the halogen and the uniform distribution of various metallic components throughout the carrier material. In addition, it is generally preferred to calcined the support after the support has been impregnated with the Group VIII metal in order to minimize the risk of washing away the Group VIII metals in other impregnation steps. The preferred way is to incorporate the Group VIII metal after incorporating other metal components, thus minimizing the loss of the Group VIII metal in other impregnation steps. Generally, the Group VIB metal is unifonnly dispersed in the catalyst, or dispersed in the fashion that their concentration gradually decreased from the surface to the center of the catalyst grain.<br>
In each step of rhe above operation for incorporating the metal component, dryine and calcining are necessary after the incorporation of each metal component. The temperature of drying is 25-300'°C, and the temperature of calcining is 370-700°C, preferably 550-650°C. Said calcination is generally carried out in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, and the preferred calcination atmosphere is air. The basis for determining the time of calcination is such that most of the metal components in the catalyst are converted to the corresponding oxides. The time of calcination varies with the change of the oxidation temperature and the oxygen content, and it is preferably 0.5-10 hr.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention can also contain other components or mixtures thereof, which act alone or are combined as<br><br>
catalyst modifiers to improve the activity, selectivity or stability of the catalyst. Said catalyst modifiers include Rh, In, Co, Ni, Fe, W, Mo, Cr, Bi, Sb, Zn, Cd or Cu. These components can be incorporated in any suitable manner into the carrier material during or after the preparation process thereof, or before, after, or during the incorporation of the other components of the catalyst according to the present invention. The content of said modifier is 0.05-5.0 mass%.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention can also contain alkali or alkali-eartli metals, which can be incorporated into the catalyst in any known manner. However, the preferable method is to impregnate the support with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble, decomposable compound of the alkali or alkali-earth metal. Said alkali metals are Cs, Rb, K, Na, or Li, and said alkah-earth metals are Ca, Sr, Ba, or Mg, the content of which is 0.05-5.0 mass%.<br>
The preparation process also comprises a halogen adjustment step to ensure a suitable acidity of the catalyst. The compounds used for incorporating halogens are preferably chlorine, HCl, or an organic compound which can be decomposed to produce chlorine such as dichJoromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane. The temperature of the halogen adjustment is 370-700'C, and the time thereof is 0.5-5.0 hr or more. During this procedure, suitable amount of water is required, and the mole ratio of water to HCl is 1.0-150:1. The halogen adjustment step may take place during, or before, or after the calcination of the catalyst. The content of halogen in the final catalyst product is preferably 0.2-4,0 mass%.<br>
It is necessary to employ a reduction step before the use of the catalyst according to the present invention in order to reduce the Group VIII metal component to the corresponding elemental metallic state and to ensure that they are uniformly distributed throughout the refractory inorganic oxide suppon. The reduction step should be taken place in a substantially water-free environment, e.g., the water content in the reducing gas should be less than 20 ppm. The preferred reducing gas is hydrogen, but other reducing gases such as CO and the like may also be used. The reduction temperature is 315-650'°C, and the preferred reduction time is 0.5-10.0 hr.<br><br>
The reduction step can be taken place before the catalyst is charged into the reactor, or taken place in situ before the beginning of the reforming<br>
reaction.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention is appropriate for the catalytic reformmg of naphtha to increase the octane number of gasoline and the yield of aromatics. Said naphtha is rich in naphthenes and paraffins and selected from full-boiHng gasoline having an initial ASTM D-86 boiling point of 40--80°C and an end boiling point of 160-220°C, a light gasoline with a boiling range of 60-150°C, or a heavy naphtha with a boiling range of 100-200°C.

The water content in the feedstock entering into the conversion zone should be less than 50 ppm, preferably less than 20 ppm. The water in the reforming feedstock may be removed by using the conventional adsorbents such as molecular sieves, or be adjusted by suitable stripping operations in a fractionation unit. The water in the feedstock can also be removed by the combination of adsorbent drying and stripping operation. The water content in the hydrogen stream entering into the hydrocarbon conversion zone is preferably 10-20 ppm or less.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention is also suitable for other hydrocarbon conversion reactions, such as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis, isomerization, desulfurization, cyclization, alkylation, cracking, and hydroisomerization of hydrocarbon feedstocks.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention is preferably used in a<br><br>
sulfur-free environment. The desulfurization of the naphtha teedstock can be carried out by any conventional process, such as adsorption desullurization, catalytic desulfurization, etc. Adsorption desulfurization processes may employ molecular sieves, crystalline aluminosilicates, high surface area SiO2-.Al2O3, activated carbon, high surface area metal-containing compounds such as high surface area compounds containing Ni, or Cu and the like. Conventional processes such as hydrorefining, hydrotreating, or hydrodesulfurization and the like can be used for catalytic desulfurization.<br>

The selectivity and acti\ity stability of the catalyst according to the present invention axe improved owmg to the simultaneous modification of the bimetallic catalyst by using cerium and europium. Compared with the catalyst modified solely with cerium or europium separately, the catalyst according to the present invention has higher liquid yield and greatly reduced carbon deposition rate under the same reaction conditions and aromatics yield.<br>
The present invention will be described in detail by the following examples, but is not limited thereto.<br><br>
EXAMPLE I Preparation of the spherical catalyst of the present invention. (1) Preparation of the Sn-containing Al2O3 support. According to the process of Example 1 of CN 1150169A, 100 g SB aluminum hydroxide powder (produced by Condea Chemie GmbH, Germany) and the suitable amount of deionized water were stirred to a slurry with a liquid/solid weight ratio of 2.0. 7.5 ml dilute nitric acid (with a volume ratio of 1:1), 30 g urea, and a predetermined amount of solution of stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid were added so that the Sn content in the solution is 0.30 mass% on the basis of the dry alumina. The resultant content was stirred for 1 hr, and 30 g kerosene, 3 g fatty alcohol polyoxyetliylene ether were added and stirred for another 1 hr, and then were formed into spheres in an oil-ammonia column by dropping. The wet spheres were solidified in ammonia water for 1 hr, then filtered, washed with deionized water for 2-3 times, dried at 60'C for 6 hr, 120°C for 10 hr, and calcined at 600'C for 4 hr to yield Sn-containing support (a).<br>
(2)	Incorporation of europium<br>
100 g spherical support (a) was added into 180 ml solution of europium nitrate in nitric acid 1ith a concentration of 2.27 mass%. The liquid/sclid ratio in the impregnation is 1.8. After impregnating for 24 hr, the mixture was filtered, and the resultant sohd was dried at 60 for 6 hr, 120 for 10 hr, then calcined in air containing 2-3% steam at 600°C for 4 hr to yield the support containing Sn and Eu.<br>
(3)	Incorporation of cerium<br>
The Sn- and Eu-containing support obtained in step (2) was impregnated for 24 hr with 180 ml solution of cerium nitrate with a concentration of 0.58 \vt%. The solution/solid ratio in impregnation is 1.8. The mixture was filtered, and the resultant solid was dried at 60°C for 6 hr, 120°C for 10 hr, then calcined in air containing 2-3% steam at 600 for 4 hr to yield the support containing Sn, Eu, and Ce<br>
(4)	Incorporation of platinum<br>
The support prepared in the previous Step was impregnated with a mixed solution formulated with the predetermined amount of chloro-<br><br>
platinic acid, hydrochloric acid, and trichloacetic acid. The content of Pt in the mixed solution should be such that the resultant catalyst contains the required Pt content, and the amounts of hydrochloric acid and trichloroacetic acid are 12% and 5.0% respectively on the basis of the mass of alumina on drv- base. The liquid/solid ratio of the mixed impregnation solution to the support is 1.8, and the impregnation time is 24 hr.

COMPARATI^-E EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of spherical catalysi A containing Pt, Sn and Eu. A catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1, except that cerium has not been incorporated into the support, and the impregnation solution for incorporating europium is 180 mi of 0.62 mass% solution of europium nitrate. The composition of the prepared catalyst A is shown in Table 1<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 A catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Comparative Example   1,  except that the impregnation solution for incorporating europium is 180 ml of 1.36 mass% solution of europium nitrate. The<br><br>
composition of the prepared catalyst B is shown in Table 1.<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of a spherical catalyst containing Pt, Sn, and Ce. A catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1, except that europium has not been incorporated into the support, and the impregnation solution for incorporating cerium is 180 ml of 1.70 mass% solution of cerium nitrate. The composition of the prepared catalyst E is shown in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
The present example demonstrates the valence of the lanthanide element in the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
The hydrogen absorption spectrum of Catalysts F, G, H, I, J and Comparative Catalysts A, B were measured by the following method: a temperature-programmed reduction procedure was effected using 3mol% Kn in He, with ramping from room temperature to 800'C at a rate of S^C per minute. The reduction peak below 600 *C was integrated for calculating hydrogen consumption. The result thereof is shown in Table 2.<br>
As can be seen from Table 2, Catalysts F, G, H, I, J have increased hydrogen consumption as compared with Catalysts A and B which do not contain Ce. The increased hydrogen consumption indicates that more than 85% of Ce in the catalysts of the present invention are -3 valence,<br>
EXAMPLE 8 The present example evaluates the selectivity of the catalysts of the present invention.<br><br>
2 g catalyst was charged into a micro-reactor A straight run naphtha of 86-15 rC was used as the feedstock, whose properties are shown in Table 3. The conditions for evaluation were: 0.70 MPa, the volume space velocity of the feedstock 2 hr-1 the volume ratio of hydrogen/hydrocarbon 800:1. During the reaction, the reaction temperature was regulated at 490^C, 500°C, 510X, and 520°C respectively to aher the yield of aromatics. The evaluation results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, in case of the same aromatics yield, catalysts F-I of the present invention have higher C5 yield as compared with Comparative Catalyst B, showing that the selectivity of the catalysts of the present invention has been greatly improved as compared with Comparative Catalyst B which contains only europium.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Catalysts J of the present invention and Comparative Catalysts A and C were evaluated in a micro-reactor with the evaluation conditions and feedstock oil the same as those of Example 8. The results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 2 shows that in case of the same content of Eu, when same aromatics yield was achieved, the C5+ yield of Catalyst J is 2 m.% higher than that of Catalyst A. The C5+  liquid yield of Catalyst J is slightly<br>
higher than that of Catalyst C which has an increased content of Eu.<br>
However, as can be seen from Figure 3, in case of the same aromatic yield, the temperature needed for Catalyst C is 5-8o'C higher than that of Catalyst J, indicating that the acti\ity of Catalyst C is significantly lower than that of Catalyst J.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Catalysts J of the present invention and Comparative Catalyst E were<br>
ev^aluated in a micro-reactor with the evaluation conditions and feedstock<br>
oil the same as those of Example 8. The results are shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Figure 4 shows that in case of the same aromatic vield, the C vield<br><br>
of Catalyst J is 2 m.% higher than that of Catalyst E when catalyst of the present invention was compared with Comparative Catalyst E which<br><br><br>
The present example evaluates the influence of the content of cerium in the present invention on the selectivity of the present catalyst.<br>
Catalysts F, G, H, I, and Comparative Catalyst B were evaluated according to the procedure of Example 8. The results thereof are shown in Figure 6.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 6 that when the Ce/Pt atomic ratio in the catalyst is less than 1.3, the yield of aromatics does not decrease significantly, on the contrary, the yield of aromatics rises somewhat when the temperature is higher than 500oC. However, when the atomic ratio of Ce/Pt in the catalyst is higher than 2.2, the yield of aromatics will decrease.<br><br><br><br><br>
