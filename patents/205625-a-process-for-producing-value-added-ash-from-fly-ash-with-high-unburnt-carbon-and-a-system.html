APPLICANT<br>
THERMAX LIMITED, HAVING REGISTERED OFFICE AT D-13, MIDC INDUSTRIAL AREA, CHINCHWAD, PUNE-411 019, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AN INDIAN COMPANY<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
 2 JUL 2004<br><br>
FtLEO OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to "A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING VALUE ADDED ASH FROM FLY ASH<br>
\   WITH HIGH UNBURNT CARBON AND A SYSTEM	<br>
PRIOR-ART		<br>
It is already known in the prior art fly ash being used for blending with cement but with a limited proportion depending upon LOI (loss on ignition) levels. Presently this is restricted in case the unburnt carbon level (LOI) in the fly ash is more than 5%.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF THE PRIOR ART:<br>
1.	Limited blending proportions of captive fly ash.<br>
2.	Increased handling / transportation costs for fly ash from thermal power plants.<br>
3.	Non-acceptable blackish colour fly ash blended cement<br>
4.	Limitations for applications other than cement.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore, a primary object of this invention to propose improved method for effectively reducing the unburnt carbon (LOI) in the fly ash.<br>
It is another object of this invention to propose an improved process for recovering additional energy along with generating value added product such as ash with a very low loss on ignition from fly ash.<br>
It is further object of this invention to propose such an improved process for obtaining producing ash from fly ash which will be suited for use for cement manufacturing /asbestos manufacturing / silica extraction for use in voltaic (PV cells) / installation linings / filtration and many other applications.<br>
Jt is further object of this invention to propose such an improved process by which not onJy the processed fly ash is produced with reduced unburnt levels but also with number of other favourable parameters like fineness / specific surface area/ comprehensive strength/ lime reactivity / chemical composition etc. so as to make it absolutely suitable for cement blending / PPC manufacturing.<br>
2_<br><br>
It is thus an object of this invention to obtain value added product ash from Fly ash suited for multifarious applications.<br>
It is also another object of this invention to propose an improved system for handling Fly Ash to obtain a value added ash with low loss on ignition.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to propose such a system, which can be easily handled, supervised and operated and in which good quality steam can be generated for further use.<br>
These and other objects of this invention will be apparent from the following paragraphs.<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE PROCESS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for producing value added product ash from Fly Ash with high unburnt Carbon using the system herein described.<br>
(a)	supplying Fly Ash of different levels of loss of ignition to combustion in a fluidized bed combustor in the presence of air,<br>
(b)	thereafter passing the products of combustion as flue gas through closed loop recycle system so as to separate the solids having high carbon from the solids having low carbon due to density differences, recycling the so separated solids having high carbon into the combustor,<br>
(c)	passing flue gas containing low carbon solids through a heat exchange state where heat is recovered from the flue gases to produce steam,<br>
(d)	followed by passing the flue gas leaving the heat exchange stage through a dust collection system so as to collect processed value added ash having low loss on ignition.<br>
(e)	and venting clean flue gas devoid of Fly Ash into a stack.<br>
There is also proposed improved process for producing value added product ash from Fly Ash with high unburnt carbon which comprises,<br>
supplying Fly Ash of different levels of loss of ignition to combustion as flue gas through closed loop recycle system so as to separate the solids having high carbon from the solids having low carbon due to density differences, recycling the so separated solids having high carbon into the combustor,<br>
3<br><br>
passing flue gas containing low carbon solids through a heat exchange state where heat is recovered from the flue gases to produce steam,<br>
Followed by passing the flue gas leaving the heat exchange stage through a dust collection system so as to collect processed value added ash having low loss on ignition and venting clean flue gas devoid of fly ash into a stack.<br>
In this process the fly ash used can have different levels of loss on ignition viz. 6% to 30%.<br>
The air supplied to the fluidization stage for fluidizing Fly Ash is preheated air upto 300 ° C<br>
4<br><br>
The preheated air is introduced at a pressure of upto 800 mm wc from lower level of fluidizing system. In a preferred embodiment the fluidization combustor includes a inbed heat exchange facility in the form of heat exchanger.<br>
The inbed heat exchanger facility extracts heat from the bed and the extracted heat is recovered in the heat exchange stage for producing steam from water.<br>
The products of combustion from the fluidization stage are recycled to the top of the fluidization stage by means of a closed loop recycle system so as to recover solids having high carbon solid portion and the product gases leaving the recycle system stage having very low carbon solids in the fly ash.<br>
The hot flue gases from the recycle stage exchange heat with water in the heat exchange stage to produce steam and a stream of cool flue gases having value added ash.<br>
The value added ash produced in this process is recovered in a dust collection stage so as to recover substantially all the value added ash and to produce clean flue gases suitable for venting to the atmosphere.<br>
We have studied various aspects of the process of the invention and have been able to obtain several advantages of which the important advantages are mentioned below:<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW INVENTION :<br>
1.	Higher efficiency - thus maximum energy recovery<br>
2.	Reduced fuel cost for steam / power generation<br>
3.	Eliminates ash disposal cost<br>
4.	Eliminates ash procurement cost<br>
5.	Reduces cement manufacturing costs<br>
6.	Increased blending up to 35%   in cement<br>
5<br><br>
