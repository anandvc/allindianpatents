Description<br>
Method of modeling the time gradient of the state of a steel<br>
volume by means of a computer and corresponding objects<br>
The present invention initially relates to a method of<br>
modeling the time gradient of the state of a steel volume by<br>
means of a computer,<br>
- with the steel volume being modeled in the computer through<br>
a number of volume elements,<br>
- with the state of the steel volume at a specific point in<br>
time including variables for each of the volume elements<br>
which are characteristic of an enthalpy present at this<br>
point in time in the respective volume element and that are<br>
characteristic for components in which the steel is present<br>
in the respective volume element at this point in time in<br>
the phases austenite, ferrite and cementite,<br>
- with the computer determining for at least one of the volume<br>
elements the time gradient of the characteristic variables<br>
by solving a thermal conductivity equation and a phase<br>
transition equation.<br>
The present invention then relates to a data medium with a<br>
computer program stored on the data medium for executing a<br>
modeling method of this type and a computer with mass storage<br>
device in which the computer program is stored, so that the<br>
computer executes a modeling method of this type when the<br>
computer program is called.<br>
Finally the present invention also relates to an influencing<br>
device for influencing the temperature of an actual steel<br>
volume, especially a cooling line, which is controlled by one<br>
of these types of computer, as well as steel which has passed<br>
through such an influencing device.<br><br>
200506097<br>
2<br>
These types of modeling method and the corresponding objects<br>
are known. The reader is referred for example to the<br>
applicant's DE-B4-101 29 565 and especially to DE-B3-102 51<br>
716.<br>
In process automation of the handling of steel the modeling of<br>
the metal temperature has particular significance. In such<br>
cases it is basically of no consequence whether the modeling<br>
of the metal temperature is undertaken in relation to a steel<br>
volume which is located in an oven or is passing through a<br>
rolling process or a cooling process for example. Phase<br>
transitions which can also occur with metals within the fixed<br>
phase make computation with the thermal conductivity equation<br>
difficult in such cases. If an accurate computation is<br>
required, the phase transition must be included in the<br>
determination of the time gradient of the state of the metal<br>
volume.<br>
With steel in particular the phase transition only occurs<br>
after a delay since the temperature changes occurring are so<br>
large that the transition cannot follow the temperature<br>
change. Frequently this is caused by alloying elements which<br>
are added to the steel.<br>
The reason for this delayed transition lies - in steel for<br>
example - in the presence of carbon in the steel. This is<br>
because, although carbon dissolves relatively well in<br>
austenite, it only dissolves to a very small, practically<br>
negligible extent in ferrite. This delays phase transitions<br>
from austenite to ferrite since the carbon in the austenite<br>
must first diffuse out before ferrite can form.<br>
Austenite can also form a further phase, namely cementite.<br>
Cementite together with ferrite forms a mixed phase which is<br>
also referred to as pearlite. At first sight it appears<br><br>
200506097<br>
3<br>
completely unclear and almost hopeless to take such a<br>
complicated process into account correctly in a thermal<br>
conductivity equation.<br>
In the prior art the following solutions have been initially<br>
attempted:<br>
The modeling of the phase transition has been greatly<br>
simplified.<br>
The modeling of the phase transition was undertaken in an<br>
advance computation with an approximated temperature<br>
gradient. The phase transition was then fixed. Exothermic<br>
processes in the phase transition were taken into account by<br>
heat sources in the Fourier thermal conductivity equation.<br>
However this coupling of the phase transition in the form of<br>
heat sources to the Fourier thermal conductivity equation<br>
only appears to solve the problem. A more precise<br>
consideration actually shows that the approach is physically<br>
incorrect. This is especially evident from the fact that<br>
parameters are to be set separately for the heat sources,<br>
which is not required for a correct solution.<br>
An already significantly improved approach is known from DE-<br>
B4-101 29 565, in which the thermal conductivity equation is<br>
correctly applied. The phase transition equation is however<br>
only valid for a two-phase system (e.g. the austenite-ferrite<br>
system). An expansion to a three-phase system (e.g. the<br>
austenite-ferrite-cementite system) is not easily possible.<br>
Also the variables thermal conductivity and temperature<br>
occurring there in the thermal conductivity equation are only<br>
dependent on the enthalpy and a phase component. The<br>
dependence on a phase component is sufficient in such cases<br>
since because of the observation of a pure two-phase system<br>
there, the second phase component is implicitly produced from<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064183 / 2005P06097WOUS<br>
4<br>
the situation that the sum of the two phase components must be<br>
one.<br>
In DE-B3-102 51 716, also cited above, the thermal<br>
conductivity and the temperature are functions which depend on<br>
the enthalpy and the proportions of all phases considered. In<br>
a three-phase system, e.g. the austenite-ferrite-cementite<br>
system mentioned in DE-B3-102 51 716, the thermal conductivity<br>
and the temperature are thus functions which depend on the<br>
enthalpy and all phases.<br>
Attempts to implement the two last-mentioned steps have<br>
actually led to significantly better results than previously.<br>
However discrepancies have occurred between the behavior of<br>
the steel volume determined in accordance with the modeling<br>
method and the actual behavior of a corresponding actual steel<br>
volume.<br>
It is known from the technical article ,,Computer simulation of<br>
steel quenching process using a multi-phase transformation<br>
model" by Tamas Reti et al., appearing in Computational<br>
Materials Science 22 (2001), pages 261 through 278, that the<br>
phase transition from austenite into ferrite, pearlite and<br>
bainite depends on the carbon concentration in austenite. In<br>
the specialist article the concentration of carbon in the<br>
austenite phase is equal to the concentration of carbon in the<br>
steeJ. considered overall.<br>
The object of the present invention consists of creating a<br>
method of modeling of type specified at the start of this<br>
document and of creating the corresponding objects by means of<br>
which a higher-quality modeling of the steel volume is<br>
possible is, while simultaneously keeping down the computing<br>
effort required for this.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064183/ 2005P06097WOUS<br>
5<br>
The object is achieved by one of the characteristic variables<br>
being a locally-invariable average concentration of<br>
interstitial elements within the respective volume element in<br>
the austenite phase of the respective volume element.<br>
the proportion of the phase austenite in the respective volume<br>
element and the enthalpy of the respective volume element<br>
respectively, so that the proportions of the phases ferrite<br>
and cementite in the respective volume element are variables<br>
derived from the characteristic variables. Interstitial<br>
elements are in such cases elements which on absorption in<br>
iron occupy intermediate grid locations. Examples of<br>
interstitial elements are carbon and nitrogen. The opposite of<br>
interstitial elements are substitutional elements. The<br>
elements replace iron atoms at their grid locations. Examples<br>
of substitutional elements are manganese and nickel.<br>
In reality the concentration of interstitial elements in the<br>
phase austenite is location-dependent. In precise terms the<br>
exact distribution of interstitial elements in the phase<br>
austenite would thus have to be taken into account within the<br>
framework of the modeling method. This procedure leads however<br>
to very great computing outlay, but has practically no effect<br>
on the quality of the modeling.<br>
In the inventive process it is not necessary to explicitly use<br>
the phase proportions as parameters. This is because, if pA,<br>
pF and pZ are used labels for the proportions of the<br>
austenite, ferrite and cementite phases in the respective<br>
volume element, then the following equation applies<br><br>
If furthermore cA, cF and cZ are used as labels for the<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064183/ 2005P06097 WOUS<br>
5a<br>
respective locally-invariable average concentration of<br>
interstitial elements within the respective volume element in<br>
the phases austenite, ferrite and cementite in the respective<br>
volume element and c is used as a label for the overall<br>
proportion of interstitial elements in the respective volume<br>
element, then the following equation also applies<br><br>
if furthermore cA, cF and cZ are used a labels for the<br>
respective locally-invariable average concentration of<br>
interstitial elements within the respective volume element in<br>
the phases austenite, ferrite and cementite in the respective<br>
volume element and c is used as a label for the overall<br>
proportion of interstitial elements in the respective volume<br>
element, then the following equation also applies<br><br>
The overall proportion c of interstitial elements in the steel<br>
can in this case simply be viewed as constant. Since<br>
furthermore the average concentration cF of interstitial<br>
elements in the ferrite phase is known to be almost zero, it<br>
can be practically ignored in equation 3. The value cZ for<br>
cementite is also a known constant, namely 0.25. The equation<br><br>
200506097<br>
6<br>
3 can thus be simplified to<br><br>
There are thus five variables in equations 1 and 3, namely the<br>
proportions pA, pF and pZ of phases austenite, ferrite and<br>
cementite as well as the locally-invariable average<br>
concentration cA of interstitial elements in the phase<br>
austenite and the overall proportion c of interstitial<br>
elements in the steel. When three independent variables of<br>
these five are specified the two remaining variables are thus<br>
able to be determined immediately and directly uniquely.<br>
On the basis of equation 3 in particular the proportion pZ of<br>
the phase cementite is produced immediately<br><br>
On the basis of equation 1 the proportion pF of ferrite in the<br>
at least one volume element is thus also determined<br>
immediately.<br>
This procedure especially makes it possible to determine the<br>
phase proportions pF and pZ of the phases ferrite and<br>
cementite in the respective volume element and thereby to<br>
determine all relevant input parameters without having to<br>
undertake divisions. The avoidance of divisions in particular<br>
has the advantage of enabling the increased computing effort<br>
for executing divisions to be avoided and also means that no<br>
specific provisions have to be made for the case in which the<br>
divisor assumes the value zero. Furthermore inaccuracies are<br>
avoided which otherwise occur because of the need to divide by<br>
small values in individual cases.<br>
Yet it is still possible in a simple manner for the computer<br>
within the framework of solving the thermal conductivity<br><br>
200506097<br>
7<br>
equation and/or within the framework of solving the phase<br>
transition equation, for the at least one volume element, to<br>
determine a relationship between the enthalpy and the<br>
temperature and, in doing so, to take into account that the<br>
relationship between the enthalpy and the temperature depends<br>
on the concentration of interstitial elements in the austenite<br>
phase of the respective volume element.<br>
This is because in the prior art there have previously been<br>
attempts to determine the relationship between the enthalpy<br>
and the temperature on the basis of the equation<br><br>
with eA, eF and eZ being functions which describe a<br>
relationship between the enthalpy and the temperature in the<br>
at least one volume element for the case in which the volume<br>
element is exclusively present in the austenite, ferrite or<br>
cementite phase. Although this procedure is correct in terms<br>
of its approach, it does not take account however of the fact<br>
that the relationship between the enthalpy and the temperature<br>
in the austenite phase is also dependent on the concentration<br>
of interstitial elements in the austenite phase. By contrast,<br>
in the present invention, this dependency can easily be taken<br>
into account in the function eA.<br>
Preferably the computer already determines before the modeling<br>
of the time gradient of the state of the steel volume for a<br>
plurality of values of the characteristic variables the<br>
relationship between the enthalpy and the temperature and<br>
stores it as a checkpoint field. This is because this makes it<br>
possible for the computer within the framework of the modeling<br>
of the time gradient of the state of the steel volume to<br>
determine the temperature obtaining in the at least one volume<br>
element on the basis of the checkpoint field. This is because<br><br>
200506097<br>
8<br>
the computing effort for solving the thermal conductivity<br>
equation and the phase transition equation can be greatly<br>
reduced. The advance determination is only made possible in<br>
this case by the concentration of interstitial elements to be<br>
applied within the at least one volume element as locally<br>
invariable.<br>
In a similar way it is also possible for the computer, even<br>
before the modeling of the time gradient of the state of the<br>
steel volume for a plurality of values of the characteristic<br>
variables, to determine a relationship between the enthalpy<br>
and the thermal conductivity and store them as a checkpoint<br>
field. This is because this makes it possible for the<br>
computer, within the framework of the modeling of the time<br>
gradient of the state of the steel volume, to determine<br>
thermal conductivity obtaining in the at least one volume<br>
element with reference to the checkpoint field.<br>
Theoretically it is also possible with the thermal<br>
conductivity to take account of a dependency of the thermal<br>
conductivity in the austenite phase of the concentration of<br>
interstitial elements in the austenite phase. In practice<br>
however these effects are however often negligible.<br>
It is of advantage for the thermal conductivity equation in<br>
the multidimensional case or one-dimensional case to take the<br>
form<br><br>
In this case λ is the thermal conductivity of the at least one<br>
volume element, ρ is the density of the steel and Q is a<br>
quantity of heat which is created in the at least one volume<br>
element by external influences. The quantity of heat created<br><br>
200506097<br>
9<br>
by outside influences in the at least one volume element in<br>
this case does not contain any components which are based on<br>
phase transitions.<br>
The approach for the thermal conductivity equation has the<br>
advantage that the temperature changes caused by the thermal<br>
conductivity and by phase transition can be correctly modeled.<br>
Different procedures for solving the phase transition equation<br>
are possible. For example it is possible for the computer,<br>
within the framework of solving the phase transition equation,<br>
to determine the Gibbsean free enthalpies of the phases<br>
austenite, ferrite and cementite on the basis of the Gibbsean<br>
free enthalpies.<br>
Conversion rates of the phases austenite, ferrite and<br>
cementite and on the basis of the conversion rates the<br>
proportions pA, pF and pZ of the phases austenite ferrite and<br>
cementite are determined. This procedure is for example<br>
described in detail in DE-B3-102 51 716.<br>
Alternatively it is also possible for the computer within the<br>
framework of solving the phase transition equation<br>
- by solving at least of one Stefan problem for the at least<br>
one volume element, to determine an austenitic region and a<br>
distribution of a concentration of the interstitial elements<br>
in the austenitic region of the at least one volume element<br>
and<br>
- the overall proportion of the austenite phase is determined<br>
based on the ratio of the austenitic region and the at least<br>
one volume element.<br>
This procedure is described in detail in the older German<br>
Patent Application DE 10 2004 005 919.5 not published as of<br>
the date of application of the applicant's present<br><br>
200506097<br>
10<br>
application. In such a case the average concentration of<br>
interstitial elements in the austenite phase can be determined<br>
by averaging the distribution of the concentration of<br>
interstitial elements in the austenitic region of the at least<br>
one volume element.<br>
The inventive modeling method can be executed offline.<br>
Especially because it avoids unnecessary divisions and<br>
provides the opportunity to determine the temperature and the<br>
thermal conductivity in advance as multidimensional checkpoint<br>
fields, it is however also possible for the computer to<br>
execute the modeling process online and in realtime with the<br>
passage of a corresponding actual steel volume through an<br>
influencing device for thermal influencing of the actual steel<br>
volume.<br>
The influencing device is as a rule embodied as a cooling line<br>
for the steel volume. It would however also be possible for<br>
the influencing device to be embodied as a rolling frame for<br>
the steel volume.<br>
It is possible for the computer to only undertake the modeling<br>
as such but not to make any control interventions. This can be<br>
sensible for example for testing and optimizing the modeling<br>
method. In many cases it will however be the case of the<br>
computer, while applying the modeling method, determining<br>
process management variables for explicit influencing of the<br>
state of the actual steel volume and transferring them to the<br>
influencing device.<br>
Preferably the computer is supplied with an actual temperature<br>
of the actual steel volume detected after the thermal<br>
influencing of the actual steel volume. This is because the<br>
computer is then in a position to compare the actual<br>
temperature with the corresponding temperature determined<br><br>
200506097<br>
11<br>
within the framework of the modeling method and to adapt the<br>
modeling method if required.<br>
Further advantages and details emerge from the subsequent<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment in conjunction with the<br>
drawings. The figures show the following basic diagrams:<br>
FIG. 1 a computer schematic,<br>
FIG. 2 a flowchart,<br>
FIG. 3 a schematic of an influencing device and a<br>
computer,<br>
FIG. 4 a scheme for determining a relationship between<br>
the enthalpy and the temperature,<br>
FIG. 5 and 6 a combination of a thermal conductivity equation<br>
with a phase transition equation,<br>
FIG. 7 and 8 possible implementations of a step of FIG. 2 and<br>
FIG. 9 a further flowchart.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 1 a computer 1 has the usual<br>
components 2 to 8. These are firstly a processor unit 2 and a<br>
mass storage device 3. The mass storage device 3 can for<br>
example be embodied as a hard disk. There are also interfaces<br>
4 and 5. Interface 4 is an interface for connecting to the<br>
computer 1 a data medium 9 embodied as a removable medium.<br>
Depending on the embodiment of the interface 4 the data medium<br>
9 can be embodied for example as a CD-ROM or as a USB memory<br>
stick. Interface 5 is an interface to a computer network 10,<br>
e.g. to the Internet or World Wide Web. The further components<br>
6 to 8 of the computer 1 are an input device 6, an output<br>
device 7 and random access memory 8. The input device 6 can<br>
for example be a keyboard and a mouse. The output device 7 can<br>
be a terminal and a printer.<br>
A computer program 11 is stored on the removable medium 9.<br>
After the removable medium 9 is connected to the interface 4<br><br>
200506097<br>
12<br>
of the computer 1, the computer program 11 is read out The<br>
read out computer program 11 is stored by the computer 1 in<br>
the mass storage 3. When the computer program 11 is called -<br>
for example because of corresponding entries made by a user 12<br>
via the input device 6 - the computer 1 thus executes a<br>
modeling method which is described in greater detail below.<br>
Using the modeling method the time gradient of the state Z of<br>
a steel volume 13 is to be modeled. This is done by the steel<br>
volume 13 being modeled in the computer 1 - more precisely in<br>
its random access memory 8 - by a number of volume elements<br>
14. As a rule in such cases the steel volume 13 is modeled by<br>
a plurality of volume elements 14 which adjoin each other. In<br>
the individual case however it is also possible for the steel<br>
volume 13 to be modeled by only a single volume element 14.<br>
If the steel volume 13 is modeled by a number of adjacent<br>
volume elements 14, the arrangement of the volume elements 14<br>
can alternately be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-<br>
dimensional. The most common case here is the three-<br>
dimensional arrangement. A two-dimensional arrangement of the<br>
volume elements 14 arises for example if the behavior of a<br>
corresponding actual steel volume 13' is to be modeled, which<br>
is embodied in bar form, for example a billet 13' or another<br>
profile. This is because in these cases the heat flow in the<br>
direction of the bar is practically negligible. A one-<br>
dimensional arrangement of the volume elements 14 especially<br>
arises if the actual steel volume 13' is strip-shaped. This is<br>
because in this case a heat flow across the strip and along<br>
the strip is practically negligible. Only in the strip<br>
thickness direction does a significant heat flow occur.<br>
The state of an individual volume element 14 at a specific<br>
time t includes the enthalpy e of the respective volume<br><br>
200506097<br>
13<br>
element 14 and the proportions pA, pF, pZ of the austenite,<br>
ferrite and cementite phases in the respective volume element<br>
14 or of variables e, pA, cA characteristic of these<br>
proportions. Corresponding to this the state Z of the steel<br>
volume 13 at this time t includes the totality of the states<br>
of all volume elements 14 of the modeled steel volume 13.<br>
The time gradient of the state Z of the steel volume 13<br>
depends on a plurality of parameters. One of the parameters is<br>
the chemical composition C of the steel. The chemical<br>
composition C includes items such as an overall proportion c<br>
of interstitial elements. This composition is thus fed to the<br>
computer 1 in accordance with FIG. 2 in a step S1.<br>
The chemical composition C can for example be predetermined by<br>
a corresponding entry of the user 12. It can however also be<br>
predetermined for the computer 1 - see FIG. 3 - by a higher-<br>
ranking process control computer 15 via a suitable computer-<br>
computer interface 15'.<br>
The interstitial element occurring most frequently in steel is<br>
carbon. Therefore, for reasons of brevity, carbon will always<br>
be referred to below even if the interstitial elements in<br>
general are meant by this.<br>
In a step S2 - i.e. even before the solution of the thermal<br>
conductivity equation and the phase transition equation - the<br>
computer 1 then determines two multidimensional checkpoint<br>
fields for the thermal conductivity A. of the steel and for the<br>
temperature T of the steel. The checkpoint fields thus have at<br>
least three input parameters, namely the enthalpy e of the<br>
respective volume element 14 and two variables pA, cA. One<br>
characteristic variable is the proportion pA, in which the<br>
steel is present in the respective volume element 14 in the<br>
austenite phase. The other characteristic variable is the<br><br>
200506097<br>
14<br>
locally invariable average carbon concentration cA in the<br>
austenite phase of the respective volume element 14 within of<br>
the respective volume element 14.<br>
The overall proportion of carbon c of the steel is temporally<br>
constant for a given chemical composition C of the steel and<br>
is the same for all volume elements 14. Because of the<br>
relationships between the phase components pA, pF, pZ, the<br>
overall proportion of carbon c and the average carbon<br>
concentration cA in the austenite phase, it is a simple matter<br>
to determine the further phase proportions pF, pZ, of the<br>
ferrite and cementite phases in the respective volume element<br>
14.<br>
The computer 1 thus determines in step S2 for a plurality of<br>
possible values of the Enthalpy e, of the proportion pA of the<br>
austenite phase and the average carbon concentration cA in the<br>
austenite phase of the respective volume element 14 the<br>
corresponding temperature T and the corresponding thermal<br>
conductivity X of the volume element 14. A functional<br>
relationship is thus produced between the enthalpy e on the<br>
one hand and the temperature T or the thermal conductivity X on<br>
the other hand. This checkpoint fields will be stored. They<br>
can thus be evaluated later very quickly within the framework<br>
of the solution of the thermal conductivity equation by linear<br>
interpolation or non-linear interpolation (e.g. by means of<br>
multidimensional B-splines).<br>
Preferably the computer 1, when determining the relationship<br>
between the enthalpy e and the temperature T, takes account of<br>
the average carbon concentration cA in the austenite phase as<br>
such, i.e. not only to determine the proportions pF and pt.<br>
The relationship between the enthalpy, e and the temperature T<br>
is determined in accordance with FIG. 4, namely preferably on<br><br>
200506097<br>
15<br>
the basis of the formula<br><br>
In this case eA, eF and eZ are functions that in each case<br>
describe a relationship between the enthalpy e and the<br>
temperature T in the volume elements 14. eF in this case<br>
describes the relationship in the event of the volume element<br>
14 exclusively being present in the ferrite phase. Similarly<br>
eZ describes the relationship in the event of the volume<br>
element 14 exclusively being present in the cementite phase.<br>
The functions eF and eZ are not dependent on the average<br>
carbon concentration cA in the austenite phase of the volume<br>
element 14. The function eA on the other hand, which describes<br>
the relationship between the enthalpy e and the temperature T<br>
in the event of the volume element 14 being present in the<br>
austenite phase, is dependent as such on the average carbon<br>
concentration cA in the austenite phase. This dependency is<br>
thus taken into account in the function eA in accordance with<br>
FIG. 4.<br>
If one wished to calculate with absolute precision, it would<br>
even be necessary to apply the carbon concentration in the<br>
austenite phase within the respective volume element 14 at<br>
variable locations. But then it would no longer be possible,<br>
for the temperature T, to determine said temperature in<br>
advance in the form of a checkpoint field. In this case the<br>
determination of the temperature T would have to be undertaken<br>
within the framework of the modeling of the time gradient of<br>
the state Z of the steel volume 13 itself. This procedure<br>
would also demand a significant computing effort. For this<br>
reason the carbon concentration cA in the austenite phase is<br>
applied as locally invariable within of the volume element 14<br>
observed in each case.<br><br>
200506097<br>
16<br>
The checkpoint field for the thermal conductivity X is<br>
determined in accordance with FIG. 4 in a similar way with<br>
reference to the equation<br><br>
λA, λF and λZ in this case are functions which each describe a<br>
relationship between the enthalpy e and the thermal<br>
conductivity λ in the volume element 14 in the event of the<br>
volume element 14 being exclusively present in the austenite,<br>
ferrite or cementite phase. In precise terms the function λA is<br>
likewise dependent on the average carbon concentration cA in<br>
the austenite phase of the respective volume element 14. It is<br>
thus possible to take account of this dependency accordingly<br>
if necessary. In many applications the influence of the<br>
average carbon concentration cA in the austenite phase of the<br>
respective volume element 14 is only slight however and can in<br>
be ignored in its practical effects.<br>
In a step S3 the computer 1 then accepts an initial state ZA<br>
of the steel volume 13. Within the framework of a pure offline<br>
modeling - see FIG. 1 - it is for example possible for this<br>
initial state ZA to be specified to the computer 1 by the user<br>
12 via the input device 6. On the other,hand, if the modeling<br>
method is executed online - possibly even in realtime - with<br>
the passage of a corresponding actual steel volume 13' by an<br>
influencing device 16 for influencing the actual steel volume<br>
13' (see FIG. 3) - the specification is made using an<br>
appropriate measuring device 17, which is arranged at the<br>
start of the influencing device 16. In both cases however the<br>
initial state ZA corresponds to the state of the corresponding<br>
actual steel volume 13' on entry into the influencing device<br>
16.<br><br>
200506097<br>
17<br>
In a step S4 the computer 1 continues to accept the peripheral<br>
conditions. For example the time gradient with which the<br>
actual steel volume 13' will actually be thermally handled on<br>
its passage through the influencing device 16 can be<br>
prespecified to the computer 1. If the influencing device 16,<br>
which is the normal case, is embodied for example as a cooling<br>
line 16, the time gradient of the actual thermal influencing<br>
of the steel volume corresponds to the time gradient of the<br>
cooling of the actual steel volume 13'. If the influencing<br>
device 16 (in exceptional cases) is to be embodied as a<br>
rolling line, the thermal influencing corresponds to the<br>
rolling processes undertaken on the actual steel volume 13',<br>
minus the cooling process on passage through the rolling line.<br>
In steps S5 to S10 the computer 1 then determines the time<br>
gradient of the state Z of the modeled steel volume 13.<br>
In the ideal case this is done by the computer 1 solving<br>
individually for each volume element 14 of the modeled steel<br>
volume 13 a thermal conductivity equation and a phase<br>
transition equation, and in this way determining the time<br>
gradient of the characteristic variables e, pA, cA. In the<br>
minimal case this is done by the computer 1 solving the<br>
thermal conductivity equation and the phase transition<br>
equation for just one of the volume elements 14 and then<br>
transferring the state determined for this one volume element<br>
14 to all other volume elements 14 of the modeled steel volume<br>
13. This is because this last-mentioned procedure also leads<br>
to the result of the computer 1 defining for each volume<br>
element 14, and each point in time t the enthalpy e of the<br>
respective volume element 14, the phase proportion pA and the<br>
concentration cA - and thereby implicitly also the phase<br>
proportions pF and pZ.<br><br>
200506097<br>
18<br>
A practice a middle way is often adopted in which the thermal<br>
conductivity equation is solved individually for each volume<br>
element 14 but the phase transition equation only for an<br>
individual volume element 14 or only for a part of the volume<br>
elements 14, for example every eighth (8 = 23) or every<br>
27th. (27 = 33) volume element 14. In each case however the<br>
computer 1, in step S5, sets the current state Z of the<br>
modeled steel volume 13 equal to the initial state ZA of the<br>
steel volume 13 supplied in step S3. Then the computer 1 in<br>
step S6 for a time step 5t solves the thermal conductivity<br>
equation for at least one of the volume elements 14.<br>
Furthermore the computer 1 in step S7 for the same time step<br>
5t solves the phase transition equation for at least one of<br>
the volume elements 14. Where required, the results determined<br>
will be transferred for the other volume elements 14. To be on<br>
the safe side it should also be mentioned that the sequence of<br>
steps S6 and S7 is irrelevant.<br>
The thermal conductivity equation can - depending on the type<br>
of modeled steel volume 13 or 13' - be solved as a<br>
multidimensional or one-dimensional equation. If the thermal<br>
conductivity equation is solved as a multidimensional equation<br>
it has the following form as depicted in FIG. 5.<br><br>
In this equation t is the time, p the density of the steel and<br>
Q the volume of heat created by outside influences in the<br>
volume element 14 observed. It does not contain any amounts<br>
which stem from phase transitions, div and grad are the usual<br>
mathematical operators divergence and gradient.<br>
If the thermal conductivity equation is solved as a one-<br>
dimensional equation, in equation 5 the mathematical operators<br><br>
200506097<br>
19<br>
divergence and gradient are replaced by the one-dimensional<br>
location derivation, x is in this case the location coordinate<br>
of the one dimension. The thermal conductivity equation is<br>
thus simplified in accordance with FIG. 6 to<br><br>
This simplification is permissible if the timing behavior of a<br>
steel strip is to be modeled. This is because in such a case<br>
the heat flow along the strip and across the strip is<br>
negligible. There is only a significant heat flow through the<br>
thickness of the strip.<br>
Regardless of whether the thermal conductivity equation is<br>
solved multidimensionally or one-dimensionally, the computer<br>
1, to solve the thermal conductivity equation (step S6) and<br>
the phase transition equation (step S7), determines in<br>
accordance with FIG. 5 and 6 the respective thermal<br>
conductivity λ produced and the respective temperature T<br>
produced on the basis of the checkpoints determined in step<br>
S2. The concrete values for the thermal conductivity λ and the<br>
temperature T can be determined in this case for example by<br>
linear interpolation or by an interpolation with smooth curves<br>
- keyword multidimensional splines.<br>
If an even more precise determination of the temperature T is<br>
demanded, it is possible to also take into account a surface<br>
energy. In this case the state of a volume element 14 also<br>
includes a number n of the pearlite layers formed or deposited<br>
in the observed volume element 14 at the respective time t,<br>
also the number of ferrite-cementite-ferrite-cementite layers<br>
.... Naturally a variable equivalent to these in size can be<br>
included.<br><br>
200506097<br>
20<br>
The number n produces in connection with the change of the<br>
proportion pA of the austenite phase in the observed volume<br>
element 14 a change of the surface energy contained in the<br>
observed volume element 14. The enthalpy e will in this case<br>
be corrected by the change in the surface energy and the<br>
temperature T then defined with reference to the corrected<br>
value of the enthalpy e.<br>
The correction by the surface energy can, since the surface<br>
energy is independent of the temperature T, be taken into<br>
account quickly and simply as an offset. Alternatively it<br>
could naturally also be taken into account by the checkpoint<br>
field for the temperature T containing as a further dimension<br>
the change in the surface energy or also the number n of the<br>
layers.<br>
The phase transition equation can in principle be designed in<br>
any way. It is important that the computer 1 within the<br>
framework of solving phase transition equation, explicitly<br>
determines the characteristic variables pA, cA and thereby<br>
also implicitly determines the proportion pA, pF and pZ of the<br>
steel present in the observed volume element 14 in the phases<br>
austenite, ferrite and cementite. This can, as indicated in<br>
FIG. 4 occur for example by the computer 1 determining, within<br>
the framework of solving the phase transition equation, the<br>
Gibbsean free enthalpies of the austenite, ferrite and<br>
cementite phases. On the basis of the Gibbsean free enthalpies<br>
the computer 1 then determines conversion rates of the<br>
austenite, ferrite and cementite phases. On the basis of the<br>
conversion rates the computer 1 finally determines the<br>
proportions pA, pF, pZ of the austenite, ferrite and cementite<br>
phases. This implementation is shown schematically in FIG. 7.<br>
It thus represents one possible embodiment of step S7 of FIG.<br>
2.<br><br>
200506097<br>
21<br>
FIG. 8 shows a possible alternative implementation of step S7<br>
of FIG. 2. In accordance with FIG. 7 the computer 1 determines<br>
within the framework of solving the phase transition equation<br>
an austenitic region and a distribution of the carbon<br>
concentration in the austenitic region of the respective<br>
volume element 14. The austenitic region and the distribution<br>
of the carbon concentration are determined in this by solving<br>
at least one Stefan problem. Based on the ratio of the<br>
austenitic region and the volume element 14 overall the<br>
computer then determines the proportion pA of the austenite<br>
phase in the volume element 14 observed. By averaging the<br>
distribution of the carbon concentration the computer 1<br>
determines the average carbon concentration cA in the<br>
austenitic region.<br>
For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned that the<br>
phase transition equation can be defined independently of<br>
whether the thermal conductivity equation is employed<br>
muitidimensionally or one-dimensionally.<br>
As already mentioned, it is possible for the computer 1 to<br>
execute the modeling method online and in realtime as a<br>
corresponding actual steel volume 13' passes through the<br>
influencing device 16 for thermal influencing of the actual<br>
steel volume 13'. For reasons of possible computing capacity<br>
it is thus necessary for the volume elements 14 to be of a<br>
size significantly greater than the actual particle size of<br>
the steel. This also applies if the computer 1 only acts as an<br>
observer, i.e. does not itself act to control the influencing<br>
device 16.<br>
After the state equations have been solved in steps S6 and S7<br>
the computer 1 determined the logical variable DONE in step<br>
S8. The logical variable DONE assumes the value "true" if the<br><br>
200506097<br>
22<br>
steel volume 13 in accordance with the modeling has exited<br>
from the influencing device 16. Otherwise it assumes the value<br>
"false". Depending on the logical Variable DONE the computer 1<br>
checks in step S9 whether it is to continue at step S10 or<br>
whether it is to perform a further pass through the steps S6<br>
to S9.<br>
Provided the computer 1 continues with the further execution<br>
of the modeling method with step S10, it sets in step S10 an<br>
end state ZE of the modeled steel volume 13 to the last<br>
determined state Z.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 2 steps S11 to S14 are still to be<br>
executed after step S10. These steps are only optional<br>
however.<br>
In step Sll the computer 1 accepts an actual end state ZE' of<br>
the actual steel volume 13'. For example - see FIG. 3 - a<br>
further measuring device 17' which is arranged at the end of<br>
influencing device 16, can detect an actual temperature T' of<br>
the actual steel volume 13.<br>
In step S12 the computer 1 determines a logical variable B.<br>
The logical variable 8 assumes the value "true" if the end<br>
state ZE determined within the framework of the modeling<br>
method matches (at least approximately) the actual final state<br>
ZE'. Otherwise it assumes the value "false".<br>
The value of the logical variable 8 is checked by the computer<br>
1 in step S13. Depending on the value of the logical variable<br>
8 step S14 is executed or also not executed. Within the<br>
framework of execution of step S14 the computer 1 adapts the<br>
modeling method accordingly.<br>
The adaptation of the modeling method in accordance with steps<br>
Sll to S14 is also possible if the modeling method is not<br><br>
200506097<br>
23<br>
executed online and/or not in realtime. This is because,<br>
although it is possible for example to detect the actual<br>
initial states ZA' and the actual final states ZE' in<br>
realtime, these states can only be buffered. The modeling<br>
method can then be executed offline at another time.<br>
Within the framework of the steps already described the<br>
computer 1 undertakes a pure modeling of the steel volume 13,<br>
but does not directly or indirectly control the influencing<br>
device 16. A control of this type is also possible however.<br>
For this to be done the procedure of FIG. 2 must be adapted.<br>
This is explained below in conjunction with FIG. 9. Steps S1,<br>
S2 and S11 to S14 are in this case not shown in FIG. 9. They<br>
correspond to those of FIG. 2.<br>
It is first of all necessary for the initial state ZA to be<br>
fed to the computer 1 via the measuring device 17 which is<br>
arranged in front of the influencing device 16. If the<br>
modeling method is to be adapted, it is also necessary, in<br>
step Sll likewise - for example by means of the measuring<br>
device 17' - to detect the actual final state ZE' of the<br>
actual steel volume 13' directly as it exits the influencing<br>
device 16.<br>
Furthermore it is necessary in accordance with FIG. 8, to<br>
modify steps S4, S6 and S7 to steps S4', S6' and S7'. Step S4<br>
is modified here to step S4' so that, as a peripheral<br>
condition to be considered a desired state sequence Z* is<br>
specified, for example a desired temperature gradient over<br>
time. Steps S6' and S7' essentially correspond to the<br>
following steps S6 and S7. The difference from steps S6 and S7<br>
consists of the result determined not directly producing the<br>
new state of the modeled steel volume but only a preliminary<br>
state Z' .<br><br>
200506097<br>
24<br>
But above all, in accordance with FIG. 9, steps S15 to S19<br>
must be inserted after step S5 and after step S7'.<br>
In step S15 the computer 1 sets an initial value for a process<br>
control variable P, with which the influencing device 16 is to<br>
act on the corresponding actual steel volume 13'. With this<br>
value of the actual influencing variable P the steps S6' and<br>
S7' are executed.<br>
After executing step S7' the computer 1 determines a logical<br>
variable OK in step S16. The logical variable OK assumes the<br>
value "true" if the provisional state Z' determined within the<br>
framework of the execution of steps S6' and S7' matches the<br>
corresponding desired state Z* (at least essentially) for the<br>
respective time step 8t. Otherwise the logical variable OK<br>
assumes the value "false".<br>
The value of the logical variable OK is checked in step S17.<br>
Depending on the value of the logical variable OK, either step<br>
S18 or step S19 will be executed. In step S18 the computer 1<br>
varies the process execution variable P, by means of which the<br>
corresponding actual steel volume 13' is to be influenced. The<br>
variable is of course varied in such cases taking into account<br>
the provisional state Z' and the desired state Z* at the<br>
respective time step 8t The program then returns to step S6'.<br>
When step S19 is executed, the computer 1 accepts the<br>
provisional state Z' as the new state Z. Furthermore it<br>
transfers the process execution variable P to the influencing<br>
device 16, so that the latter can thermally influence the<br>
corresponding actual steel volume 13' in accordance with the<br>
process execution variable P determined.<br>
The procedure in accordance with FIG. 9 is executed online and<br>
in realtime with the passage of the corresponding actual steel<br>
volume 13' through the influencing device 16. In this case the<br><br>
200506097<br>
25<br>
influencing device 16 will also be controlled directly and<br>
immediately by the computer 1. It would however also be<br>
possible, instead of the direct activation of the influencing<br>
device 16 in step S19 to store the corresponding process<br>
execution variables P. In this case the computer 1 could<br>
operate offline and/or not in realtime and still control the<br>
influencing device 16, if now only indirectly.<br>
By means of the inventive procedure - especially also taking<br>
into account the dependency of the temperature T on the<br>
proportion of carbon cA in the austenite - a significantly<br>
more simple and at the same time also better modeling is<br>
possible than in the prior art.<br><br>

According to the invention, a steel volume (13) is modelled in a computer (1) by means of a plurality of volume elements (14). The state (Z) of the steel volume (13) at a given time (t) comprises, for each volume element (14), characteristic quantities (e, pA, cA) of an enthalpy (e) existing at said time (t) in the respective volume element (14) and percentages (pA, pF, pZ), in which the steel is available in the respective volume element (14) at the time (t) in austenite, ferrite and cementite<br>
phases. For at least one volume element (14), the computer (1) determines the time gradient of the characteristic quantities (e, pA, cA) by resolving thermal conductivity and phase transition equations. One of the characteristic quantities (e, pA, cA) is a locally invariable mean interstitial element concentration (cA) within the volume element (14) in the austenite phase thereof.<br></td>
