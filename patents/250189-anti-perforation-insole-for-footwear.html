				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to an anti-perforation<br>
insole for footwears and, in particular, an anti-<br>
 perforation insole made of a textile material espe-<br>
cially suitable for the use in the manufacturing of<br>
accident-prevention footwears with Strobel technique.<br>
Anti perforation insoles made of a textile material<br>
are shown, among others, in US 6368989 (relating to a<br>
multilayer in exclusively aramidic fibers) and WO<br>
00/41583 (relating to a multilayer including at least<br>
a layer with high energy absorption ability in poly-<br>
nornbornene).<br>
The same Applicant is the owner of the pending patent<br>
applications for invention No. PO2003A000005 and<br>
PCT/IT/2004/000208 relating to multilayered textile<br>
structures resistant to the perforation, wherein high'<br>
toughness aramidic and non aramidic fibers are used<br>
and the single layers show a surface ceramic treat-<br>
ment .<br>
Also ballistic protections are known, wherein multi-<br>
layered textile structures are employed, which are<br>
however conceived in order to resist to the violent<br>
impact of a bullet and not to the penetration of nails<br>
(the EN 12568 regulation foresees that an anti-perforation insole resists to a<br>
force of at least 1.100 N exerted by a nail advanced at the speed of 10 mm/min.<br>
± 3 mm/min.).<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide an anti-perforation insole which<br>
is exclusively made in a non aramidic textile material and which, also being<br>
resistant to the penetration of a nail in accordance with the regulation in<br>
force, can be sewn to the upper of a footwear manufactured with Strobel<br>
technique.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides anti-perforation insole for<br>
footwear, having a multilayer consisting of at least four layers of a fabric<br>
double-faced by weft and made of high tenacity polyester fibers coupled<br>
together through a thermoplastic film or an adhesive resin, each of the fabric<br>
layers having a ceramic surface treatment.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing accident-<br>
prevention footwear comprising an upper and a sole, wherein the sole is<br>
directly produced on the upper by injection molding, and wherein an insole<br>
according to.this invention, as described herein is previously sewn to said upper.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, the anti-perforation insole is, preferably, sewn to<br>
the upper by Strobel technique, and also preferably, the insole is exclusively<br>
made from a non-aramidic textile material.<br>
In particular, the fabric shows a face with a weave of the derived spine-type<br>
and a face with a weave of the derived satin-type.<br>
The surface ceramic treatment is carried out through smearing with a<br>
polyurethane and/or acrylic resin enriched with powders of hard and abrasive<br>
materials, preferably micronized ceramic materials in form of silicates, for<br>
example of aluminium.<br>
Among the advantages obtained with an insole according<br>
to the invention, there is the fact that the double-<br>
faced fabric employed shows a high density of yarns<br>
 (in particular of weft) and a very compact structure.<br>
In particular, in view of the superposition of the<br>
warp and weft yarns, the tip of a nail, not finding<br>
openings between the yarns among which it can pene-<br>
trate, always meets the resistance of the yarn. The<br>
coating of silicates-based poliurethane further deter-<br>
mines the blocking therebetween of the warp and weft<br>
yarns and the compacting of the structure, by also<br>
contributing to the obstruction of the interfibrous<br>
and intrafibrous interstices.<br>
An insole according to the invention further shows the<br>
advantage of being able to be used in the manufactur-<br>
ing of accident-prevention footwears made with the<br>
Strobel technique.<br>
These and further advantages of the invention will re-<br>
sult apparent, together with the technical features,<br>
from the following detailed description of a non lim-<br>
iting example of embodiment.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
- Fig. 1 diagramatically shows a sectional view of an <br>
insole according to the invention;<br>
- Fig. 2 shows the interlock ratio of the fabric used<br>
for the execution of the. insole of Fig. 1;<br>
- Fig. 3 diagramatically shows the warp profile of the<br>
fabric of Fig. 2;<br>
- Fig. 4 diagramatically shows the insole of Fig. 1<br>
sewn to the upper of an accident-prevention footwear<br>
manufactured with Strobel technique.<br>
Referring to the Figures 1-3, an anti-perforation in-<br>
sole 1 according to the invention includes a multi-<br>
layer 10 consisted of at least four layers of a fabric<br>
12.. with a double face weft, made of high toughness<br>
polyester fibers, coupled together through a thermo-<br>
plastic film or an adhesive resin. Each of the fabric<br>
layers shows a surface treated by means of a coating<br>
14 (shown in Fig. 1 with enlarged thickness with re-<br>
spect to the reality) of polyurethane and/or acrylic<br>
resin enriched with micronized ceramic materials in<br>
form of silicates, for example of aluminium.<br>
For a more effective protection, it is preferable to<br>
use five layers of fabric 12 having the coating 14.<br>
The surface layer of the multilayer 10 constituting<br>
the insole 1 preferably shows the higher face (the one<br>
intended for being faced inwardly the footwear) which<br>
is not treated for a better comfort of the user.<br>
Advantageously, as it can be seen from Fig. 1, the<br>
used fabric shows a face with a heavy opposed spine-<br>
type weave and a face with a weave of the derived<br>
satin-type.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been detected that by using the<br>
fabric and the coating above described, it is possible<br>
to carry out an exclusively textile effective struc-<br>
ture, which resists to the perforating action of a<br>
nail, only using high toughness non-aramidic fibers,<br>
and therefore much more economic.<br>
In particular, for an insole according to the inven-<br>
tion, it is advantageous to use 1100 dtex polyester<br>
yarns, with a toughness of 67,5 - 80 cN/dtex, in a<br>
number of 22 ± 2% per cm. for the warp and 29 ± 2% per<br>
cm. for the weft.<br>
The used weaves allow to carry out fabrics with yarns<br>
very close together, by making the structure of the<br>
same very bound for being able to already afford, per<br>
se, a quite good resistance to the penetration, still<br>
maintaining a high flexibility.<br>
In particular, the composite weave used for the fabric<br>
in polyester fibers has proved particularly effective<br>
in the execution of the multilayer 10.<br>
The coupling between the layers of fabric can occur by<br>
hot calendering and by means of thermoplastic films<br>
(or adhesive resins) interposed between the layers of<br>
the structure. The finished insole shows a limited<br>
thickness (about 3 mm. ) and an adequate flexibility.'<br>
The tests carried out shown, in fact, the conformity<br>
of an insole (including 5 layers of fabric with a sur-<br>
face ceramic treatment) in conformity of the invention<br>
to the EN12568, ISO EN20344, ANSI Z41 and CSA regula-<br>
tions.<br>
In Fig. 4 an insole 1 is shown, according to the in-.<br>
vention, sewn according to the Strobel technique to<br>
the upper 20 of an accident-prevention footwear,<br>
equipped with a metal tip 22.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of various<br>
modifications and variations, all lying within the am-<br>
bit of the inventive concept. Furthermore, all the de-<br>
tails can be replaced by technically equivalent ele-<br>
ments.<br>
