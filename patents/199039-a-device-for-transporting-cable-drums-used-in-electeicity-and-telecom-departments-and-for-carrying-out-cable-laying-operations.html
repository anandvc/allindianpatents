				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for transporting cable drums used in the electricity and telecom departments and for carrying out cable laying operations.<br>
It is common knowledge that the underground cable used in the electricity and telecommunication sectors is one of the most expensive components used in such sectors.<br>
It is also common knowledge that such cables are wound around large drums and these drums will have to be transported from one place to another when cables have to be laid.<br>
Conventionally, crude contrivances are employed for moving cable drums from one place to another, such contrivances being hazardous to traffic, as well as, to pedestrians on the roads, apart from causing damage to the cable itself.<br>
One of such known contrivances consists of large wheels {about as large as the drum itself) disposed on either side of the cable drum and connected by an axle passing through a central bore in the hub of the drum.   The<br><br>
The wheels are so	located that the weight of the  whole<br>
structure,  after	the drum is loaded,   comes  on the<br>
wheels, without	any significant turning moment on<br>
sither side.<br>
The frameworks at the first end El are provided with a cowing tackle W with an eye E or a hook. The second and E2 of the frameworks are open at O to receive the dirum D in the space S between the frameworks.<br>
A saddle T is movably mounted on each framework. In the irawings the saddles T are shown to be slidably mounted in guides G in the frameworks F.<br>
leans for raising and lowering each saddle and fixing  in predetermined positions on each framework are provided. One of possible forms of such means comprises the bevel gear arrangement B coupled to the shaft V threadedly engaged with the saddle on each ramework.<br>
as the bevel gears are rotated in one direction or the other by manually operating the handle-wheels H, the caddles are raised or lowered by the shafts. In one of<br><br>
possible forms, the shafts will be threadedly engaged to the saddles, so that the shafts remain stationary while the saddles can be raised and lowered in threaded engagement with the shafts, whenever the gears are operated. In another form the shafts will be fixed to the saddles and will thus move up and down, with the saddles, when operated by the gears. Two persons are enough to rotate the handle-wheels H.<br>
The drum D is received within the space S by trundling the device towards the drum (the drum being stationary) until the drum is received in the space S between the frameworks F and disposed therebetween. The saddles T are then lowered, by operating the bevel gears until a U-slot Z in each saddle is located at the same level as the central hols H in the drum. A rod R is then passed through the said hole, to serve as an axle. The free ends of the axle protruding outside the drum, on either side thereof, are then made to rest in the U-slot in each saddle.<br>
Next, the saddles are raised by operating the bevel gears to raise the drum sufficiently above ground level. The U-slots prevent the drum from rolling off the saddles.<br><br>
After the drum is raised as described above, in order to ensure that the weight of the drum is not transmitted, all the time, from the saddles to the gears, cotter pins are passed through graded bores M in the frameworks and matching bores N in the drum faces. Once this is done, the saddles can be slightly lowered, just out of contact with the axle R, so that the weight of the drum is taken up by the said pins and the framework and not transmitted by the saddles to the gears. To allow this operation to be carried out, the bores M in the frameworks are of the elongated type.<br>
The drum thus loaded, raised above ground level, can be towed away, manually or by a motor vehicle, by a hook<br>
engaged with the eye E. The drum unloading operstion is carried out by following the reverse procedure.<br>
Preferably, the towing tackle is movably attached to the framework so that the device can easily negotiate turns on the road while being towed.<br>
Another embodiment (Fig.4) of the device proposed herein is intended for heavier load carrying capacity, where the drums  are bigger and heavier.   In this<br><br>
embodiment the wheels employed are four in number unlike the first embodiment where the wheels employed are two. This embodiment is similar to the first embodiment in operation.<br>
The second end of the frameworks has a removable cross bar J which can be removed while accessing the drum and fastened after the drum is loaded. This serves as a further precaution against the drum rolling off the frameworks after loading. The frameworks are also structurally reinforced to cope with the greater load coming on them.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
l.A device for transporting cable drums used in the electricity and telecom departments and for carrying out cable laying operations and the like comprises two spaced frameworks, attached to each other and mounted on lockable wheels, the first end of the frameworks being provided with towing tackle, the second end of the frameworks being open to receive the drum in the space between the frameworks; a saddle movably mounted on each framework; means for raising and lowering each saddle and fixing it in predetermined positions on each framework; an axle for being passed through the central hole of the drum, once the drum is received in the said space, to rest on the saddles, whereby when the saddles are raised sufficiently by the said means, the drum is raised above ground level to be towed away.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the towing<br>
tackle comprises an eye or a hook at the first end of<br>
the frameworks.<br>
3.	A device as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the  said<br><br>
eye or hook is movably attached to the tackle.<br>
4.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the means for raising and lowering each saddle and fixing it in predetermined positions comprise a shaft and gear arrangement, the gear arrangement being manually operable by a handle-wheel.<br>
5.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the means for raising and lowering each saddle and fixing it in a predetermined position comprise graded bores in the frameworks and cotter pins for passing through the said bores and through matching bores on the faces of the drum.<br>
6.	A device as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the bores on the frameworks are of the elongated type.<br>
7.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
Claims wherein the frameworks are mounted on two wheels.<br>
8.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
Claims  1  to 5 wherein the frameworks are mounted on<br><br>
four wheels,<br>
9.	A device as claimed in claim 8 wherein the<br>
second end of the frameworks is provided with a<br>
removable bar fixable to the said end.<br>
10.	A device for transporting cable drums used in<br>
the electricity and telecom departments and for<br>
carrying out cable laying operations and the like<br>
substantially  as herein described with reference to,<br>
and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
