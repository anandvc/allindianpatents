				<td>A method for Adjusting Transmitting window in a Radio Link Control Layer<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to radio link control in a cellular mobile communications system, especially relates to a method for adjusting transmitting window in a radio link control layer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol is a control protocol based on sliding window, which is used for controlling the transmission of data package of radio link, as shown in Fig. 1. In a transmitting party of RLC, the block with cross-biases refers to the data package that is confirmed to have not been received by an opposing party and must be retransmitted, the blocks with shadow refer to the data package waiting to be confirmed by the opposing party, and the blank blocks refer to buffers that have not been used. In a receiving party of RLC, the block with cross-biases refers to the data package that has been lost during transmission by the opposing party and needs to be re-received, the blocks with shadow refer to data package that have been received, and the blank blocks refer to the buffer that have not been used. Basic variables in RLC protocol are described in the following: Configured_Tx_Window_Size: an initial value of transmitting window, which is configured to the RLC transmitting party by a upper protocol layer, and is also the largest size of transmitting window, with a unit presented by a number of Protocol Dada Units (PDU); and the RLC transmitting party applies for transmitting buffer according to this variable.<br>
VT(S): a variable of transmitting status, which represents a serial number of next Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) that needs to be transmitted, not including a Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) re-transmitted.<br>
VT(A): a variable of confirmation status, which represents a serial number of next sequential Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) that waits to be confirmed by the receiving party.<br>
VT(MS): a variable of maximum transmitting status, if a serial number of a Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) exceeds or equal to this value, the Protocol Dada Unit is not allowed to transmit, and VT(MS)=VT(A)+VT(WS).<br>
VT(WS): a size of transmitting window, its initial value, which is also the biggest value, is Configured_Tx_Window_Size, the least value is 1 or value configured by other upper layer, and VT(WS) varies in this scope.<br>
Configured_Rx_Window_Size: a size of initial receiving window, which is configured to the RLC receiving party by a upper protocol layer, with a unit represented by a number of Protocol Dada Units (PDU); and RLC applies for receiving buffer according to this variable.<br>
VR(R): a variable of receiving status, which represents a serial number of next sequential Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) to be received.<br>
VR(H): a variable of receiving status with highest expectation, which represents a serial number of highest Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) expected to be received.<br>
VR(MR): a variable of the biggest allowable receiving status, if a serial number of a Protocol Dada Unit (PDU) exceeds or equal to this value, the Protocol Dada Unit will be refused to receive by the RLC receiving party, and VR(MR)=VR(R)+Configured_Rx_Window_Size.<br>
The RLC receiving party notifies the RLC transmitting party by a status package<br>
PDU (Status PDU) that some packages have been received and some packages have not been received. After receiving the status package PDU, the RLC transmitting party changes the value of the variable of confirmation status VT(A), and pushes forward the variable of maximum transmitting status VT(MS), to guarantee continuous transmission of data.<br>
When the RLC transmitting party detects that a certain PDU has not been answered by the receiving party, such as the block with cross-biases in the RLC transmitting party in Fig. 1, the value of the variable of transmitting status VT(S) is caused to continuously increase until reaching the variable of maximum transmitting status VT(MS), and then a data with a serial number more than or equal to VT(MS) will be not transmitted.<br>
When RLC receiving party detects that a certain PDU has not been received, such as the block with cross-biases in the RLC receiving party in Fig. 1, the value of a variable of receiving status with highest expectation VR(H) is caused to continuously increase until reaching the variable of the biggest allowable receiving status VR(MR), and then a data with a serial number more than or equal to VR(MR) will be not received.<br>
In the current RLC protocol, it provides that: a RLC receiving party, based on state of its own receiving buffer, controls a size of window for a RLC transmitting party to transmit data, thereby controlling the use of bandwidth for the radio link. Its scheme is including a window size indication (Window Size SUFI) information in a status package PDU transmitted to the RLC transmitting party, and, after the RLC transmitting party receives the Window Size SUFI information, changing the size of transmitting window VT(WS) to WSN. If WSN equals to zero, the SUFI information is discarded; if WSN exceeds the largest size of transmitting window<br>
Configured_Tx_Window_Size, the size of transmitting window VT(WS) is set as Configured_Tx_Window_Size. When the radio link deteriorates, data may be lost, which results in an increase in buffer in the RLC receiving party. At this time, the RLC receiving party reduces the data transmission from the RLC transmitting party by Window Size SUFI information, and notifies the RLC transmission party to decrease the size of transmitting window VT(WS), thereby decreasing the transmitting window and avoiding the congestion of data. When the RLC receiving party detects that an available space of receiving buffer is continuously increasing up to certain thresholds, as shown in Fig. 2, all re-transmitted packages have been received, and the RLC receiving party has no buffer to use; in the same way, the RLC receiving party notifies the RLC transmitting party to increase the size of transmitting window VT(WS) so that the transmitting window is increased and the use efficiency of bandwidth in data link is avoided to decrease.<br>
According to the actual measurement of different services, the lost probability of PDU in some none real time data services may be up to 10%. In good radio condition, a RLC protocol prescribes that the lost probability of PDU does not exceed 0.7%. Therefore, as compared, the lost probability of Window Size SUFI information is higher. However, according to provisions of the current protocol, the transmitting party does not detect the use of bandwidth in a radio link, and only adjust the size of transmitting window according to the requirement in Window Size SUFI information received from the receiving party. Thus if Window Size SUFI information is lost, the transmitting party will not adjust the window on its own initiative. Moreover, there is no uniform criterion on triggering Window Size SUFI information in RLC protocol, and after one triggering it may take a long time for further triggering. Especially while the condition in the radio link becomes good and the probability of package lostdecreases, the Window Size SUFI information may not be even triggered, and, during this period, even if the radio link is good, data may be transmitted at a low rate in the radio link, thereby seriously decreasing the rate of the radio link.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for adjusting transmitting window in a Radio Link Control Layer to efficiently overcome such shortages in the prior art that the use of bandwidth in radio link is fully controlled by the receiving party so that it is impossible to adjust the transmitting window in time due to loss of Window Size SUFI information and then the use efficiency of bandwidth for the radio link control protocol is decreased.<br>
The present invention provides the method for adjusting transmitting window in a radio link control layer, in which the RLC transmitting party controls the use of bandwidth in radio link by deciding periodically whether a size of transmitting window needs to be adjusted, and adjusting the size of transmitting window in the RLC transmitting party if the use efficiency of bandwidth is decreased.<br>
The step of deciding periodically whether a size of transmitting window needs to be adjusted in the RLC transmitting party, comprises:<br>
Step 1: setting a threshold N according to a condition of a radio link;<br>
Step 2: detecting periodically a ratio K of a variable of transmitting status VT(S) and a variable of confirmation status VT(A) to and the largest size of transmitting window Configured_Tx_Window_Size in the RLC transmitting party, the ratio K representing a ratio of a relative distance between VT(S) and VT(A) to the Configured_Tx_Window_Size;<br>
Step 3: comparing the ratio K with the threshold N, and indicating that the<br>
transmitting window needs to be adjusted if the ratio K is less than the threshold N, otherwise returning to step 2.<br>
The steps of adjusting the size of transmitting window in the RLC transmitting party, comprises:<br>
Step 1: determining in the RLC transmitting party W, a size of transmitting window that can be satisfied by the radio link, and<br>
Step 2: comparing a size of transmitting window VT(WS) with W, and, if VT(WS) is less than W, setting the value of VT(WS) as W.<br>
According to the present invention, the RLC transmitting party does not depend on Window Size SUFI information transmitted by the RLC receive party, but determines the use state of the link bandwidth according to its own state variables, and thereby adjusts the size of transmitting window. In such way, the defect that the transmitting window is unable to be adjusted timely when Window Size SUFI information is lost can be avoided, and the transmitting window can be adjusted promptly, approaching the aim of utilizing radio bandwidth fully and most efficiently.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The present invention will be further described in more details in the following in<br>
combination with the appended drawings.<br>
Basic idea of the present invention is determining a status of buffer in the RLC receive party by detecting periodically relationship of variables in the RLC transmitting party. As shown in Fig. 1, when data PDU is confirmed to loss in the RLC transmitting party, as the block with cross-biases, a relative distance between a variable of confirmation status VT (A) and a variable of transmitting status VT (S) enlarges gradually, and occupation in transmitting buffer increases gradually. In the RLC receiving party, because loss of data PDU also occurs, as the block with cross-biases, a relative distance between a variable of receiving status VR(R) and a variable of receiving status with highest expectation VR(H) enlarges gradually, and occupation in transmitting buffer of the receiving party increases gradually.<br>
However, due to delay effect of radio link, the value of the variable of receiving status with highest expectation VR(H) will be not larger than the value of the variable of receiving statusVT(S), and the value of the variable of confirmation status VT(A) will be not larger than the value of the variable of receiving status VR(R). That is also to say, the relative distance between the variable of receiving status VR(R) and the variable of receiving status with highest expectation VR(H) will be certainly not larger than the relative distance between the variable of confirmation status VT (A) and variable of transmitting status VT (S), that is,<br>
(4096+VT(S)-VT(A) mod    4096 ≥ (4096+VR(H)-VR(R)) mod 4096. But for configuration of common RLC Protocol variables, that is,<br>
Configured_Rx_Window_Size≥ Configured_Tx_Window_Size.<br>
In Protocol 3GPP TS 25.306, it states that RLC transmitting buffer should be applied according to the transmitting window, and RLC receiving buffer should be applied according to the receiving window. Moreover, since<br>
Configured_Tx_Window_Size and Configured_Rx_Window_Size are initial values of the RLC transmitting window and receiving window, when the radio resource is established, a transmitting buffer is certainly applied for according to Configured_Tx_Window_Size, a receiving buffer is applied for according to Configured_Rx_Window_Size. Therefore, occupation status of buffer in the RLC receiving party can be obtained by detecting periodically a ratio K of a variable of transmitting status VT(S) and a variable of confirmation status VT(A) to the largest size of transmitting window Configured_Tx_Window_Size in the RLC transmitting party. Even \fConfigured_Rx_Windo\v_Size<configured_tx_windo the ratio k of a variable transmitting status vt and confirmation to largest size window configured_tx_window_size can also be modified by adjusting weight factor p. if certain relationship such as less than is satisfied when comparing threshold n rlc party may taken occupation in buffer receiving then detected w that radio link it indicates bandwidth not utilized sufficiently needs set link.></configured_tx_windo>
Detailed steps of the present invention are shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Step 1: setting a threshold N, in which the threshold N is commonly very little, which can be estimated according to the transmitting window and the requirement of transmission rate in the radio link, and the threshold preferably is about 10;<br>
Step 2: detecting periodically whether Window Size SUFI information is received in the RLC transmitting party, if yes, transferring to step 8, otherwise, going to step 3;<br>
Step 3: detecting periodically a ratio K of a variable of transmitting status VT(S)<br>
and a variable of confirmation status VT(A) to the largest size of transmitting window Configured_Tx_Window_Size in the RLC transmitting party, in which the ratio K represents a ratio of a relative distance between VT(S) and VT(A) to the Configured_Tx_Window_Size;<br>
Step 4: comparing the ratio K and threshold N, if the ratio K is less than threshold N, indicating that the size of transmitting window needs to enhance, transferring to step 5, otherwise, returning to step 2;<br>
Step 5: calculating a size of transmitting window that can be satisfied by the radio link, W, according to the variable of transmitting status VT(S), the variable of confirmation status VT(A) and the largest size of transmitting window Configured_Tx_Window_Size; or establishing in advance in the RLC Transmitting party a corresponding relationship between K and W, and determining directly a corresponding size of transmitting window W according to a value of K;<br>
Step 6: comparing a size of transmitting window comparing VT(WS) and W, if VT(WS) <w going to step otherwise></w>
Step 7: setting the value of VT(WS) as W, and going to Step 2; and<br>
Step 8: setting the value of VT(WS) as a value of WSN in Window Size SUFI information received lately, and going to step 2 for continuing to detect.<br>
The above process is being performed in entire operation in the RLC transmitting party, until the RLC Transmitting party expires.<br>
It will be described in an embodiment below, in which the ratio K is calculated by the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)if K&gt;100, K=100; and, in this formula, P is a weight factor, and satisfies the following condition:<br>
Configure d _ Tx _ Win dow _ Size<br>
i	~~	..J-iJ--.--.-nr     ^	f       ^        \J      ,<br>
Configured _Rx_ Window _ Size<br>
And W, a size of transmitting window that can be satisfied by the radio link, can be calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and used after rounding down the value calculated in above formula.<br>
The threshold is set as: N=10, when K<n the size of transmitting window is increased. it supposed that configured_tx_window_size="512," configured_rx_window_size="512," vt detected in rlc party variable status confirmation></n>
Such process may be implemented as follows:<br>
setting threshold N=10; the transmitting party does not receive Window Size SUFI information, then detecting periodically the value of the ratio K, here K=0; deciding whether a comparison of K and N satisfies a condition for increasing the window size, since K<n the size of transmitting window needs to be increased calculating w that can satisfied by radio link></n>
W = Configured_Tx_Window_Size = 512;<br>
comparing the size of transmitting window VT (WS) with W, which meets VT(WS)<w setting the size of transmitting window vt as value w then continuing for detecting.></w>
