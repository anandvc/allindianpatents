Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a device for the selective control of an oscillating transverse movesment of a yam, especially of a warp yarn of a weaving machine, according to the pre-characterizing clause of Claim 1.<br>
Prior art<br>
Many devices of the type mentioned in the introduction are known. Thus, for example in the production of patterned fabrics, dobbies or Jaccpiard machines are used for the selective control of the warp yarns. In this case, each warp yam is guided through the closed eye of a heald and is raised or lowered indirectly via the heald frames of a dobby or the harness chord of a Jacquard siachlne. Such devices are known, inter alia, from US-A-4 936 352, EP-B-0 421 370, EP-A-0 302 798, EP-A-0 534 523 and DE-C-40 23 512.<br>
A disadvantage of this type of selection and movement of the individual warp yarns is the considerable electronic and mechauiical outlay which is zaanifest in a large space requirement of the dobby or Jackguard machine next to or above the weaving machine and in high costs. The more individual yams are controlled, the more expensive the solution becomes. Another serious disadvantage of existing shedding devices, irrespective of whether they use the Jacquard or heald-frsune technique, is that all the warp yarns are guided individually through the closed eyes of healds. Considere±&gt;le manual exertion or mechanical outlay is necessary for drawing In the waxp yams. Guidance in the closed eye of a heald restricts the degree of freedom of<br>
P-484600<br>
DSC Direct End Control<br>
15 September 1995/lh<br><br>
the warp yam, so that it is freely movable only in the warp direction, and this has to be compensated by a complicated control and actuation of direct elements, such as healds, and of indirect elements, such as heald frames, harness, Jacguard lifters, xoagnets, etc., the elements for the warp yarns executing, individually in Jacquard machines or in groups in dobbies, movements which occur at different times.<br>
US-A-5 261 464 describes a device which has open heald eyes in a lifter moving up and down. However, this device has several disadvantages. The design of the orifice does not allow a yam to be coupled and uncoupled during weaving, but serves merely for drawing in the warp yarn while the weaving machine is at a standstill. Furthermore, due to the design of the guide elements, only low yarn densities are possible. The actuation of the healds entails a high mechanical outlay.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to design a device of the type mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that direct control of a yarn is possible, the previous closed yam orifices in healds are replaced, direct elements, such as a dobby or Jacguard machine, are dispensed with, and the selection of an individual yarn, especially a warp yam, is possible, at the same time with a substantially smaller space requirement.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, by means of the characterizing features of Claim 1. Since the driver drives the yam only when the actuator actuates the control meams in such a way that the yam comes into engagement with the corresponding driver and the yam is otherwise exposed, on the one hand the insertion of the yam into the device becomes substantially easier auad, on the other hand, the yarn can be controlled and driven individually in the simplest possible way, thereby appreciably iioproving the control of the yarn and consequently, in the case of a weaving machine, the possibilities for patterning a fabric to be<br><br>
produced.<br>
The device is suitable for the most diverse uses, thus, for example, in order selectively to present weft yarns of different colours and qualities to a weft insertion member so as to be gripped by the latter.<br>
The device has further appreciable advantages, especially in connection with a weaving machine. The integration of a selection mechanism into the lifter dispenses with numerous complicated mechanical elements for the control and deflection of warp yarns, such as a dobby, Jacquard machine and harness. If the lifters are arranged, for example, on heald frames of a weaving machine, these no longer have to be driven irregularly in confonnity with the fabric pattern, but uniformly, for example with a sinusoidal movement, and can thereby be made sxibstantially simpler and more robust, thus reducing the costs and increasing operating reliability. Since indirect control and actuating elements between the selection member and controlled yarn are dispensed with, the necessary forces are diminished, thus considerably reducing the space requirement and energy demand. The warp yarns are no longer drawn in fixedly in healds, but are freely movable in the vmcoupled state along the lifter. They can be coupled and uncoupled both while the weaving machine is in operation and during standstill, thereby affording advantages in terms of the weave and during the drawing-in of the yarns.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the device are described in Claims 2 to 16.<br>
The device can be implemented in various ways. Thus, the driver can be connected fixedly to the lifter, the control means actuated by the actuator serving, when required, for feeding the yarn to the driver for take-up by the lifter. A preferred embodiment of the said type is described in Claim 2. In a fundamentally different embodiment of the invention, the driver itself is moved by means of the actuator out of the basic position, in which there is no yarn take-up, into a take-up position, in which a yarn is deflected by means of the lifter.<br><br>
Advantageous alternative versions of the second tyi:)e of control are described in Claims 3 and 4.<br>
The driver of a lifter can, if appropriate, take effect in both directions of movement of the lifter,. For this purpose, the driver can be of fork-shaped design, the fork aperture lying transversely to the direction of movement of the lifter. A design according to Claim 5 is more advantageous, however, and in this case the lifter itself can also have a second driver effective in the other direction of movement or the driver necessary for the other direction of movement is arranged on a further lifter. There are various alternatives for the design and arrangement of the driver. Thus, the driver can be hook-shaped or have at least one notch for the reliable gripping of the yarn. The arrangement of the driver at the end of an outwardly bendable control tongrue is also particularly advantageous. The driver can be formed, for example, either by a shaping of the control tongue or by mounting an individual part on the control tongue. The function of the control tongue can also be performtid by a special shaped-out portion of the lifter, the said shaped-out portion already having been mentioned above. A development of the control element accoi-ding to Claim 6 is expedient. The reliability of the gripping of the yarn can be improved by means of an embodiment according to Claim 7, a development according to Claim 8 being preferred.<br>
An embodiment according to Claim 9 is particularly advantageous, as a result of which the yarns selected by the lifter are separated from other yarns by means of a separating lifter. The latter can also limit the deflection of the control tongue or of another movable control means. A particularly advantageous arrangement and design of the lifter and of the separating lifter is described in Claim 10.<br>
The actuator can advantageously be activated electrically according to Claim 11. The actuator can consist of various components, for example a piezoelectric element, a magnetizable coil, a permanent<br><br>
magnet, a memory alloy, a bimetal and the like. The electrical activatability of the actuator is essential. Actuators with low energy consumption, such as, for example, piezoelectric elements, are particularly advan¬tageous. The embodiment according to at least one of Claims 12 to 15 is advantageous, according to which the elements for controlling, regulating and monitoring the lifter and for activating the actuator are integrated in the lifter itself. Via contacts or wireless, for excimple optical connections in the foot region of the lifter and via conductive layers which are integrated onto or into the lifter, the actuators can be controlled or regulated electrically and the state of deflection and consequently operability can be monitored.<br>
The lifter can be drawn off from the carrier and slipped on again individually, for example for repair purposes. The bundling of a plurality of lifters into groups is advantageous both for activation and for assembly, for example for exchanging the lifters. The lifters and separating lifters are connected to one another in the foot region by means of spacer pieces, which can have different thicknesses, in such a way that the spacing of the said lifters corresponds to the desired yarn density. The elements necessary for controlling the group can be accommodated either on at least one of the lifters themselves or in the foot region of the group or externally, that is to say outside the lifter and foot region.<br>
The embodiment according to Claim 16 is advantageous, according to which the upper ends of the lifters are shaped or characterized in such a way that, on the one hand, they are supported relative to one another at the correct distance, that is to say at that distance which corresponds to the spacing in the foot region, and, on the other hand, they simultaneously differ from one another, so that they can be recognized and selected manually and/or by an automatic yarn read-in device.<br>
The lifters are expediently connected to a known<br><br>
control unit which controls a multiplicity of lifters, so that a specific weaving pattern can be woven. Such a control unit contains a computer or can be connected to such and makes it possible to input an original (for example, an image), for example by means of a scanner or CAD program, and to convert it according to the boundary conditions of the weaving machine (thread density in warp and weft). At the same time, the high points and low points of the fabric weave are converted into corresponding control signals for the drivers located in the lifters, so that the desired weaving pattern is obtained.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides device for the selective control of an oscillating transverse movement of a yam, especially of a warp yam of a weaving machine, with at least one lifter capable of being driven in oscillation and having at least one Aiver for the yam, characterized in that it has a control means actuable by means of an actutor, in order to bring the yam into engagement with the driver.<br>

Ways of implementing the invention<br>
Figure 1 describes a device for the selective control of an oscillating transverse movement of a yarn by the example of the control of warp yarns of a weaving machine. In this case, the weaving region of such a weaving machine is represented diagrammatically in Fiigure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a warp beam 2 which supplies warp yarns 4 which, by means of lifters 6, 6a, 6b arranged on carriers 8, 8a, 8b, are moved up and down in oscillation transversely to the direction of movement out of the position of rest, that is to say the middle shed position 10, in order to form a shed 12. A weaving reed 14 serves for beating up a weft thread 15, inserted into the shed 12, onto a cloth edge 16. The fabric 18 produced is discharged via a cloth beam 20. The individual lifters 6, 6a, 6b contain drivers 22 which can each be extended by means of an actuator and a control means out of a basic position, in which there is no yarn take-up, into a take-up position, in which yarn take-up occurs. A control unit 24, which is connected to each individual lifter 6 via lines 26, serves for actuating the actuator described in more detail below.<br>
Each lifter contains two drivers 22a, 22b which each take effect in only one direction of movement of the lifter 6 and which deflect the warp yarn 4 out of the middle shed position 10 into the upper shed 2 8 or the lower shed 30, in order to form the shed 12. However, it is also possible that two lifters 6a, 6b, which are arranged on two carriers 8a, 8b, serve in each case for deflecting a warp yarn 4 out of the middle shed position 10. Thus, the lifter 6a can deflect a warp yarn 4 only into the upper shed 28, whilst the second lifter 6b moves the warp yarn into the lower shed 3 0 for an imminent<br><br>
weaving cycle. It is thereby possible to operate the lifter at doiible its normal rate with the frequency of the drivers which is half the weaving frequency.<br>
Both the construction of weaving machines and the drive of the carriers designed as heald frames are sufficiently known, and, in this respect, reference is made, for example, to the publications mentioned in the introduction, in  particular EP-A-0 534 523.<br>
Details of the design and arrangement of the lifters are described in Figures 2 to 6. Figure 2 shows how a plurality of lifters 6 are lined up in a row with specific spacing on a carrier 8, each lifter 6 being assigned on both sides a separating lifter 32, the distances between which are determined by spacers, such as spacer pieces 34, which are lined up in a row on the carrier 8 between the lifters. Arranged and fastened at each of the two ends of the carrier is an end piece 3 6 which fixes the lifters 6, 32 and spacer pieces 34 in their position on the carrier 8 and which, furthermore, can serve in a way not shown in any more detail for the supply of energy and/or for data exchange. At the end region facing away from the carrier 8, the lifters 6^ and separating lifters 32 are px-ovided with further spacers 3 8 which are formed, for excunple, by bulges of the lifter housing. These spacers limit the distance between the lifters and, moreover, have guide faces 39 for the passage of a yarn. The separating lifters 32 serve, on the one hand, as a stop for extended drivers 22a, 22b and, on the other hand, for the separating of warp yarns 4a which are not to be processed on the respective lifter 6. The processing of a multiplicity of yarns can also be distributed to various lifter sets, as indicated by the lifter sets I and II in Figure 1. The warp yarn density can be increased by such a staggering of the lifters at successive carrier levels.<br>
Figures 4 to 6 show details of the design of a lifter which is used in Figures 1 to 3. The lifter has a housing 42 formed from two shells 42a, 42b, the shells 42a, 42b being, for example, welded to one another at the<br><br>
edges 44. The housing possesses a foot part 46 with two legs 48 which embrace the carrier 8, so that the lifter is arranged so as to be capable of being slipped and/or pushed on the carrier. However, the lifter can also be connected to the carrier in any other way, such as, for example, by screwing, adhesive bonding and the like. Furthermore, the lifter contains a head part 50, via which the individual yarns are fed. Arranged on each side between the foot part 46 and the head part 50 is a pair of drivers 22a, 22b which take effect in each case in the two directions of movement of the lifter. The drivers are fastened to the end of a control means designed as a control element in the form of a control tongue 52 which is fastened at its other end facing the fastening part 54 to a reinforcing layer 56 in the housing 42 by adhesive bonding and/or by means of studs 58. An actuator 60 which is designed, for example, as a piezoelectric element is fastened to the control tongue which can be produced from the most diverse materials, but preferably consists of spring steel. This actuator 60 is activated by means of conductor tracks 64 which are arranged on an intermediate layer 62. As soon as current is applied to the actuator 60 via the conductor track 64, an outward bending of the control tongue 52 takes place, with the result that the hook-shaped driver 22b, which, in the basic position, is located within the housing 42 of the lifter, is moved outwards through the orifice 66 in the housing 42 into the take-up position, as shown in Figures 2 and 6, and, in this position, takes up a warp yarn 4 during the up or down movement of the lifter.<br>
The actuators 60 of the drivers 22a, 22b on both sides of the lifter are connected via the conductor tracks 64 to a circuit 6 8 which is, for example, an integrated circuit, called an IC, and which is likewise arranged within the housing of the lifter. The circuit serves, for example, for activating and monitoring the actuators 60. The circuit is connected to contact 72 in the foot part 46 via a plurality of conductors 7 0 which serve, for example, for the supply of energy and/or for<br><br>
data exchange. The contacts 72 are connected to further contacts 74 in the carrier 8 which are themselves connected via lines 26 to the external control unit 24 which controls the lifter or the drivers 22a, 22b of the lifter according to the particular pattern, so that the warp yarns 4 are taken up by the lifters in accordance with the fabric pattern to be produced.<br>
In contrast to the individual arrangement of the lifters 6 and separating lifters 32 on the carrier 8 according to Figure 2, Figure 7 shows how a plurality of such lifters 6c and separating lifters 32a are combined into a group and cast or otherwise fastened, such as, for example, adhesively bonded, into a common base 76. The base 76 can then itself be fastened to the carrier 8 in the way already described above. In this example, the lifters 6c are connected via lines 64a to a circuit 68a coimnon to all the lifters of the group. The lines 7 0a for the supply of energy and/or for data exchange for the circuit 68a are parallel to the carrier 8 here. The conductors serving for data exchange can be designed as channels 70b for the transmission of optical signals, the said channels being connected in a way not shown in any more detail to the conductors of an adjacent base. The conductors 70a and/or channels 70b are directly or indirectly connected to a transmission unit 77, arranged at the end of the carrier, for energy and/or data exchange for the control of the lifters. Instead of energy being supplied from outside via a line, a battery for energy supply can be arranged in the base.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show a detail of a further lifter 6d, in which the control means are designed, for exaimple, as a diaphragm 7 8 which can be part of the housing 82. The diaphragms 78 carry actuators 60a. The diaphragms 78 are moved, as required, by means of the actuators 60a out of a basic position inside the housing 82 into and out of a take-up position, in which they project from the housing.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show a detail of a further version of a lifter 6e, the control means being designed<br><br>
as deflecting means and having deflecting tongues 84 which are arranged in pairs on each side of the housing 86 and which are provided with actuators 60b. The deflecting tongues, in their foot region, cover drivers 22d which are arranged fixedly in the housing 86 of the lifter 6e. In the take-up position, the free end 88a of a deflecting tongue 84a projects outwards into the path of displacement of the yarn 4, and the free end 88b of the other associated deflecting tongue 84b tJoints inwards and forms a slideway for guiding the yarn 4 towards the dr-iver 22d. In the basic position, both deflecting tongues 84a and 84b point inwards and thus prevent the yarn 4 from being taken up.<br><br>
