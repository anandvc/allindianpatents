METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIMILAR VIDEO CONTENT HOPPING<br>
The following relates to the entertainment arts. It particularly relates to enabling users of high-capacity personal video recorders to conveniently switch or hop to similar content in the same or different streams. However, the following relates more generally to enabling content hopping in digital broadcast television receivers, digital cable television receivers, compact audio disk players and recorders, digital radio broadcast receivers, Internet browsers, computer network browsers, and the like.<br>
Personal video recorders and players presently have storage capacities of over forty hours of video content, with capacity expected to increase substantially in the foreseeable future. In view of these large storage capacities, users can significantly benefit from tools and functions for intelligently managing, playing, and browsing the video content.<br>
The serendipitous "finding" of interesting entertainment content is of value to viewers. During viewing of broadcast, cable, or satellite television, users commonly engage in channel hopping or surfing, in which the user operates a remote channel selector control to hop between television channels in search of an interesting offering. Users frequently employ channel hopping even though printed and electronic viewing guides that identify television offerings are readily available. However, such channel hopping may not be entirely random, since the user may be familiar with the types of offerings typically shown on certain channels.<br>
Video content recorded by the user, for example using a personal video camera (i.e., camcorder) or a personal video recorder generally will not include a content guide. During playback, the user may want to engage in content hopping of the recorded content. Such content hopping is generally analogous to channel hopping except that the user is hopping between portions of a video stream or between video streams, rather than between television channels.<br>
A problem arises because the user typically does not have a convenient way to identify desirable content hops within a video stream or between streams. The user would benefit from being able to content hop within particular content types, or within content similar to that presently being viewed. Moreover, the user may want to limit<br><br>
content hopping based on similarity to a presently viewed offering or by specifying a particular type of content to hop to (for example, action scenes or a sports program).<br>
The present invention contemplates an improved apparatus and method that overcomes the aforementioned limitations and others.<br>
According to one aspect, an apparatus for playing video content is disclosed. A video content means is provided for storing at least one video stream. Each video stream includes a multiplicity of scenes. Each scene is described by a corresponding scene signature. A selection means is provided for selecting a scene signature which is descriptive of video content of a scene a user wants to view. A means is provided for comparing the selected scene signature with scene signatures of the stored video streams to identify one or more scenes whose scene signature is similar to the selected scene signature. A means is provided for playing the at least one scene whose scene signature is identified as similar to the selected scene signature.<br>
According to another aspect, a method is provided for playing video content. A scene signature is selected which describes a composite of characteristics of frames of a video scene. The selected scene signature is compared with a multiplicity of stored scene signatures which describe scenes of at least one stored video stream to identify at least one scene signature that is similar to the selected scene signature. At least one scene whose scene signature is identified as similar to the selected stream signature is played.<br>
One advantage resides in providing content-based channel hopping within a prerecorded video stream or between video streams.<br>
Another advantage resides in providing content-based hopping based on quantitative, user-specified hopping criteria.<br>
Yet another advantage resides in providing flexible and accurate content-summarizing information for use in content-based hopping.<br>
Numerous additional advantages and benefits will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br><br>
The invention may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various process operations and arrangements of process operations. The drawings are only for the purpose of illustrating preferred embodiments and are not to be construed as limiting the invention.<br>

FIGURE 5 shows an exemplary hop threshold scale.<br>
FIGURE 6 shows an exemplary semantic scenes selection menu.<br>
FIGURE 7 diagrammatically shows suitable components of the personal video recorder for performing stream hopping.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 1, a personal video recorder (PVR) 10 includes a hard disk 12 and computer-processor based controller 14. The recorder 10 records one or more streams of input audio/video data while it concurrently plays back the input data, the input data with a delay, or other previously recorded data. With current technology, hard disks with storage capacities of about 40 hours are readily available. Larger storage volumes will become available with higher density memory, multiple disk recording systems, and the like. Although described in conjunction with personal video recorders, it will be appreciated that this technique is also applicable to prerecorded audio/video media, read/write optical disks, computer systems configured to perform personal video recording tasks, and the like.<br>
The personal video recorder 10 outputs playback to an entertainment system 20 that includes a video display 22, pwhich is preferably a high-resolution display,<br><br>
and an audio speaker system 24, which is preferably a high-fidelity audio system. Although shown separately, in some embodiments the audio speaker or speakers are physically integrated into the video display device. Moreover, the personal video recorder can be physically integrated with the entertainment system 20. The personal video recorder 10 is also connected to an external source of video and/or audio input, such as a satellite television tuner 30 communicating with a satellite dish 32 that receives a satellite television signal 34 broadcast by a satellite 36. Other suitable audio/video inputs include broadcast television, cable television, broadcast radio, digital radio, and the like. Optionally, the television tuner 30 is integrated into the personal video recorder 10 or into the entertainment system 20.<br>
A user controls the personal video recorder 10, the entertainment system 20, television tuner 30, and optionally other components using a handheld remote controller 40 which transmits infrared signals 42 that are received by the personal video recorder 10, the entertainment system 20, television tuner 30, or other components to be controlled. The remote controller 40 includes buttons, rotary dials, or other controls , suitable for inputting user commands. In particular, the remote controller 40 includes a scene hop button 44 and a video stream hop button 46, which the user activates to initiate a content hop to a similar scene or a similar video stream, respectively, on the hard disk 12. For more complex control operations, an optional on-screen pointer 48 superimposed on the display 22 by the personal video recorder 10 is maneuvered using the remote controller 40 to perform selections from a displayed selection menu generated by the personal video recorder 10.<br>
With continuing reference to FIGURE 1 and with further reference to FIGURE 2, the personal video recorder 10 includes a video recording component 50 that records video input 52 received from the satellite television tuner 30 or other external video input source to the hard disk 12 or other mass storage device. Concurrently or subsequently to the recording, a scene definition processor 54 defines overlapping scenes in the video content.<br>
With continuing reference to FIGURE 2 and with further reference to FIGURE 3, the scene definition processor 54 receives video content and defines overlapping intervals corresponding to scenes. Specifically, FIGURE 3 shows two video streams 60i, 6O2, which are parsed into overlapping scene intervals corresponding to<br><br>
scenes such as the overlapping scenes 62i, 64x, 66x, 681 of the video stream 6O1, or the overlapping scenes 622, 642, 662, 682 of the video stream 602. In a suitable embodiment, each scene is between thirty seconds and ten minutes long. In one preferred embodiment, two minute scenes are spaced in overlapping fashion commencing at ten second intervals. Scene lengths and spacings are suitably determined based on a characteristic of the video content, such as an amount of activity occurring in the video content. For example, an action video preferably has shorter and more closely overlapped scenes than a video of a slower cinematic genre. It is contemplated for the scene definition processor 54 to select scene length and overlapping spacing based on a motion parameter or other characteristic of the video content.<br>
With returning reference to FIGURE 2, each scene is processed to generate a scene signature. A low level features processor 80 computes low level audio and/or video content features on a frame-by-frame or small group of frames (for example, a group of pictures (GOP)) basis. Suitable low level features include an absolute average luminance parameter, an image luminance difference parameter, a frame complexity parameter, a mean absolute difference (MAD) motion estimation parameter, a motion parameter, an image texture parameter, a color distribution parameter, a scene composition parameter (e.g., defined in terms of objects, or in terms of psycho-acoustic features), or the like. For each scene, a principle components analyzer (PCA) 82 projects the low level features into a principle components space as principle components vectors. As is known in the art, a small number of principle components can be selected that represent a substantial amount of information about the low-level features. This substantially reduces memory usage, improves similarity measure robustness and similarity computation complexity. Moreover, because PCA features are scalable in representation accuracy, a tradeoff can be made between a number of low level PCA features and consequent accuracy in representation on one side, versus memory usage, robustness, and computational complexity. Although principle components analysis is a preferred framework for computing scene signatures, other methods can be employed. For example, averages or other statistical summaries of one or a few selected low level features can be used for computing scene signatures.<br>
A scene signature generator 84 computes a suitable quantitative scene signature for each scene based on the principle component vectors of individual frames or .   -<br><br>
groups of frames of the scene. Such signatures can range from short-term signatures spanning a group of frames (that is, signatures at about a length of a GOP level PCA feature), to mid-term signatures that combine GOP level PCA features over a few minutes (that is, at about the scene length), to long-term signatures that are representative of an entire video stream or a substantial fraction thereof. Preferably, mid-term signatures that are representative of the scene are employed. Such mid-term signatures are suitably computed within the PCA framework at a GOP level according to:<br><br>
is a principle components vector of the kth GOP within the scene, L is a number of PCA features or principle components used in defining the principle components vector P(k), and NQOP is a number of GOPs in a signature interval Tmt. Typically, principle components which exhibit large (preferably largest) variance are selected as the L components used in constructing P(k). The signature interval Tmt typically corresponds to the scene length. A standard deviation feature vector for an nth feature is given by:<br><br>
where again k indexes the GOPs in the scene and ranges from 1 to NQOP- A standard deviation vector of the principle components vector is given by:<br><br>
where yet again k indexes the GOPs in the scene and ranges from 1 to NQOP* A suitable quantitative mid-term PCA-based signature is then computed according to:<br><br><br>
A preferred PCA-based mid-term scene signature is specified in Equation (5). However, other scene signatures can be employed, such as an average short-term event distribution (e.g., a number of video transitions and/or a number of black-frame occurrences in the scene interval Tmt) or a mean or standard deviation of a low level feature such as an average luminance parameter, a frame complexity parameter, a mean absolute difference (MAD) parameter, a motion parameter or combination of the above mentioned alternatives. However, the PCA framework has an advantage as a scene signature in that the principle component values are readily scaled.<br>
To facilitate rapid comparison of scene signatures during scene hopping, the scene signatures of the video content are preferably processed by a scene signatures correlation processor 90 to sort or arrange the scene signatures into a rapidly searchable scene signatures tabulation 92 that is written onto the hard disk 12 or other storage medium by the video recording component 50. Pre-correlation of scene -signatures is suitably performed using algorithms typically employed in generating searchable databases. Preferably, the scene signatures are generated as audio/video data is recorded and the scene signatures are stored in a searchable scene signatures table 92 on the hard disk 12. By organizing scene signatures by relative similarity, similar scenes can be later identified more quickly. Alternatively, the controller can process recently recorded data in a post-recording operation to generate the signatures.<br>
With returning reference to FIGURE 1 and with further reference to FIGURE 4, a video playback component 100 of the personal video recorder 10 plays back prerecorded multimedia content stored on the hard disk 12 or other mass storage device to produce an output such as an audio video output 101 that is sent to the entertainment system 20. A user operates the scene hop button 44 of the remote controller 40 to select a scene hop. The scene hop button 44 preferably can be selected at any time during video playback to initiate a content-based scene hop. Activation of the scene hop button 44 identifies a current scene 102 that corresponds to a scene being played back by the video playback component 100 when the scene hop button 44 is activated.<br>
A similar scene hop processor 104 receives the current scene 102 and accesses the searchable scene signatures table 92 to identify a corresponding similar scene<br><br>
signature. In the case of the hard disk 12 storage medium of the personal video recorder 10, the video content was recorded by the personal video recorder 10 and the searchable scene signatures table 92 was suitably generated and prerecorded on the hard disk 12 as described previously with reference to FIGURE 2. In the case of a read-only medium such as a read-only optical disk containing video content generated by a commercial vendor, the searchable scene signatures table 92 is suitably prerecorded on the optical disk by the commercial vendor.<br>
With a current scene signature selected, scene matching is suitably performed by calculating a Euclidean distance between the current scene signature and other available signatures. The Euclidean distance between the current scene signature and another scene signature is given by:<br><br>
where the index i corresponds to the current scene, S(i) is the current scene signature, the index j corresponds to the other scene (j*i)&gt; aud S(j) is the scene signature of the other scene. The similar scene hop processor 104 computes dSCCne(iJ) for every other scene (that is, for all scene indices j except for j=i) and selects the scene having the smallest corresponding Euclidean distance dscene(i j). Rather than using a Euclidean distance, other signature comparison figures of merit can be employed, such as an absolute difference according to:<br><br>
If the identified minimum Euclidean distance is smaller than a hop threshold, then the corresponding scene is selected as a similar scene 106. This similar scene 106 is input to the video playback component 100, which hops to the address of the similar scene on the hard disk 12 or other memory and plays from that point. I£ however, the identified minimum Euclidean distance is larger than the hop threshold, no hop is performed. In such a case, the user could be notified that no appropriate match was found,<br><br>
for example by a sound, or by an icon or message that is briefly displayed on the screen indicating that no appropriate match was found.<br>
With continuing reference to FIGURE 4 and with further reference to FIGURE 5, a hop threshold processor 108 preferably enables the user to select the hop threshold used by the similar scene hop processor 104. In one suitable approach shown in FIGURE 5, the hop threshold processor 108 provides the user with a hop threshold scale 110, shown on the display device 22, which ranges continuously or in discrete steps between a minimum threshold corresponding to a more similar setting and a maximum threshold corresponding to a more different setting. Li a preferred embodiment, the minimum threshold is a copy detection setting 112 in which hopping only occurs if an exact match is found. The maximum threshold is preferably a hop always setting 114 in which hopping occurs regardless of how dissimilar the match is. The extremes are copy detection 112 and hop always 114. The maximum, middle, and minimum thresholds are suitably selected in the design phase by analyzing distributions of similarity measure values over a large sampling of audio/video content. For the more similar or copy detection setting 112, a scene hop will not be performed unless the similar scene hop processor 104 locates a substantially similar scene or another copy of the same scene, that is, a scene with a scene signature quantitatively substantially similar to or the same as the current scene signature. For "the more different or hop always setting 114, a scene hop will occur even if the scene has much less similarity to the current scene signature. The user selects the hop threshold by manipulating a threshold pointer 116 using the on-screen pointer 48 superimposed on the display 22, or by manipulating other buttons or controls of the remote control 40.<br>
In one embodiment, the threshold is used to decide whether to jump to the scene whose signature is closest to the current scene signature. This blocks jumping to another scene if the closest scene is substantially dissimilar to the current scene. However, the hop threshold can be used in other ways. For example, rather than examining every other scene in the video stream, the similar scene hop processor 104 can randomly (or pseudo-randomly) compare signatures of other scenes with the current scene signature, and select as the similar scene 106 the first scene encountered in the random sampling whose signature is within the hop threshold of current scene signature. In this approach, the similar .scene 106 may not be the most similar scene, but it is similar within the<br><br>
threshold value. This approach suitably enables the user to expand the hopping to a wider range of scenes, especially if the hop threshold is set close to the hop always setting 114. Optionally, the similar scene hop processor 104 can be configured to perform the hopping using a selected one of two or more modes, such as: (i) checking all scenes and hopping to the closest scene if it is within the hop threshold; (ii) randomly checking scenes and hopping when one is found that is within the hop threshold of the current scene signature; and (iii) hopping to a randomly selected scene. In the latter mode (iii), there is no similarity comparison performed, and purely random or pseudorandom hopping is produced.<br>
Moreover, the hop threshold processor 108 is optionally omitted. This can be done for example by employing a fixed hop threshold, or by not using a hop threshold. If the hop threshold is not used, the scene with the smallest Euclidean distance dscene(ij)&gt; smallest absolute distance, or other optimized signature comparison figure of merit is selected as the similar scene 106, and the scene hop is performed regardless of the Euclidean distance, absolute distance, or other signature comparison figure of merit.<br>
With continuing reference to FIGURE 4 and with further reference to FIGURE 6, rather than using the current scene as a reference for comparison, a selected type of scene can be used for reference. A semantic scene selection processor 120 suitably selects a characteristic scene for the scene comparison. The semantic scene selection processor 120 accesses a semantic scenes table 122 which contains-exemplary scenes or scene signatures for commonly encountered cinematic scenes, such as explosion scenes, action scenes, romance scenes, sports scoring scenes, television show introductions, or the like, along with a semantic label for each scene or scene signature. The semantic scene selection processor 120 displays a semantic scenes selection menu 124 (see FIGURE 6) on the display device 22, and the user employs the on-screen pointer 48 or another selection control to select a scene of interest, such as an action scene. This scene is selected as the current scene 102, and a corresponding similar scene in the video content is selected by the similar scene hop processor 104 as described previously. A semantic scene class could consist of multiple signature (scene) examples, provided by the user or an external service. The most similar scene found is the scene WA th* cmaiiAct Aldan** to one of the examples in the class.<br><br>
With returning reference to FIGURE 1 and with further reference to FIGURE 7, the video stream hop button 46 preferably can also be selected at any time during operation of the video playback component 100, to initiate a hop to a similar video stream. A user operates the video stream hop button 46 of the remote controller 40 to select a video stream hop. Activation of the video stream hop button 46 identifies a current video stream 202 that corresponds to a video stream being played back by the video playback component 100 when the video stream hop button 46 is activated.<br>
A video stream hop processor 204 receives the current video stream 202 and compares the stream with other video streams recorded on the hard disk 12. In one suitable method, two video streams are correlated by computing a similarity for each cross-pair of scene signatures, and averaging or otherwise summarizing the cross-pair similarities. That is, to compute a correlation of video streams A and B, cross-pair similarities are computed between a first scene signature of the video stream A and each scene signature of the video stream B. This is repeated for each scene signature of the video stream A to produce the cross-pairs, which are then averaged.<br>
More specifically, with a current video stream 202 selected, video stream matching is suitably performed by quantitatively comparing streams according to:<br><br>
where Sk is a set of Nk signatures of the current video stream 202, and Sm is a set of signatures of another video stream m. A most similar video stream (nibest) 206 is identified by a minimum stream comparison index dstrcam(k,l) given by:<br><br>
where the index m runs over all video streams recorded on the hard disk 12.<br>
Similarly to the scene hopping of FIGURE 4, the stream hopping of FIGURE 7 optionally incorporates a stream hop threshold. In one suitable approach, a hop to the most similar video stream 206 is not performed if the minimum stream distance value dstream(k,mbest) is greater than the video stream hop-threshold. In another suitable<br><br>
approach, the video stream hop processor 204 selects the first stream whose quantitative video streams comparison figure of merit (such as the exemplary video streams figure of merit dstream(k,m) given in Equation (8)) is below the video stream hop threshold. The video stream hop threshold is suitably selected by a graphical video stream hop threshold scale produced by a video stream hop threshold processor 208 that is generally similar to the scene hop threshold processor 108. The stream hopping is optionally configurable to enable two or more stream hopping modes, such as: (i) checking all streams and hopping to the closest stream if the corresponding distance value is within the stream hop threshold; (ii) randomly checking streams and hopping to the first stream whose corresponding distance value is within the stream hop threshold; and (iii) hopping randomly to another stream. In the latter mode (iii), no similarity comparison is performed, and purely random or pseudo-random stream hopping is performed.<br>
Moreover, the stream hopping of FIGURE 7 optionally incorporates a semantic stream hopping option using a semantic video stream selection processor 220 that selects a characteristic video stream for the comparison. The semantic video stream selection processor 220 accesses a semantic video streams table 222 which contains exemplary semantically labeled video stream classes for commonly encountered cinematic types, such as action movies, romance movies, sports offerings, television comedies, or the like. Preferably, the semantic video stream selection processor 220 employs a video stream selection menu similar to the semantic scenes selection menu 124 of FIGURE 6. The user selects a characteristic video stream class, which is input as the current video stream 202 to the video stream hop processor 204 to search for a similar video stream on the hard disk 12. A suitable semantic stream class could include several signature sequences representative of exemplary video streams matching that class, which are provided by the user or by an external service. The most similar stream found is the stream with the smallest distance to one of the examples in the class.<br>
Embodiments have been described with reference to a personal video recorder. However, similar content-based hopping can be incorporated into a video or multimedia player that does not include record capability. Content-based hopping can also be used with other recording media besides hard disks, such as magnetic tapes, optical disks, or electronic storage units. Moreover, similar content-based hopping can be used with other types of content such as audio streams, electronic documents, computer<br><br>
software, or the like. Content hopping can also be used to monitor a plurality of real time content streams for a selected type of content. For example, a cable, broadcast, or satellite television system can be monitored for a scoring event of a televised sports game. (This can be done, for example, by referencing exemplary scoring event signatures stored in the semantic scenes table 122). Similarly, a broadcast or digital radio system can be monitored for a selected song or type of music. When the selected target content is sensed on one of the monitored streams, the display hops to the stream with the sensed target content.<br>
