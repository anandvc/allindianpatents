The graft copolymer B may be prepared by free-radical polymerization, for example by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass polymerization, preferably by emulsion or mass polymerization.<br>
Suitable monomers B.1 include vinyl monomers such as vinyl aromatic compounds and/or ring-substituted vinyl aromatic compounds (e.g. styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, p-chlorostyrene),<br>
methacrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters (e.g. methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, allyl methacrylate), acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters (e.g. methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate), organic acids (e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid) and/or vinyl cyanides (e.g. acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile) and/or derivatives (e.g. anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. maleic anhydride and N-phenyl-maleimide). These vinyl monomers may be used alone or as mixtures of at least two monomers.<br>
The preferred monomers of B.1 are styrene, cc-methylstyrene, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate and acrylonitrile. Particularly preferred monomer B.1 is methyl methacrylate as the monomer.<br>
The glass transition temperature of the graft base B.2 is lower than 10°C, preferably lower than 0°C, particularly preferably lower than -20°C. The graft base B.2 has a median particle size (d50 value) of from 0.05 to 10 µm, preferably from 0.06 to 5 µm, particularly preferably from 0.08 to 1 µm. The diameter which differentiates between two equal parts by weight of a given sample of particulate matter, one part containing all particles larger than that diameter and the other part containing all grains smaller is the median diameter. It can be determined by means of ultracentrifuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-1796).<br>
Suitable silicone rubbers according to B.2.1 are silicone rubbers having graft-active sites, the preparation method of which is described, for example, in U.S. 2,891,920, U.S. 3,294,725, DE-OS 3 631 540, EP 249964, EP 430134 and U.S. 4,888,388, all incorporated herein by reference. It is preferably prepared by emulsion polymerization, in which siloxane monomeric structural units, crosslinking or branching agents and optionally grafting agents are used.<br>
Suitable siloxane monomeric structural units include dimethyl-siloxane or cyclic organosiloxanes having at least 3 ring members, preferably from 3 to 6 ring members, for example hexamethylcyclotri-<br>
siloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, trimethyl-triphenyl-cyclotrisiloxane, tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-cyclotetrasiloxane, octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane. These organosiloxane monomers may be used alone or as mixtures of two or more monomers. The silicone rubber preferably contains not less than 50 wt.% and particularly preferably not less than 60 wt.% organosiloxane, based on the total weight of the silicone rubber component.<br>
Examples of crosslinking or branching agents include silane-based crosslinking agents having a functionality of 3 or 4, particularly preferably 4. Preferred agents include trimethoxymethylsilane, triethoxyphenylsilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetra-n-propoxysilane and tetrabutoxysilane. Crosslinking agent may be used alone or in a mixture of two or more crosslinking agents. Tetraethoxysilane is particularly preferred.<br>
The crosslinking agent may be used in an amount of 0.1 to 40 wt.%, based on the total weight of the silicone rubber component. The amount of crosslinking agent is selected so that the degree of swelling of the silicone rubber, measured in toluene, is from 3 to 30, preferably from 3 to 25 and particularly preferably from 3 to 15. The degree of swelling is defined as the weight ratio of the amount of toluene absorbed by the silicone rubber when it is saturated with toluene at 25°C, and the amount of silicone rubber in the dry state. The determination of the degree of swelling is described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,877,831, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable grafting agents are compounds that are capable of forming structures having the following formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed ) wherein<br>
R1       is C1-C4-alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl or propyl, or phenyl,<br>
R2      is hydrogen or methyl,<br>
n        is  0, 1 or 2 and<br>
p        is 1 to 6.<br>
Preferred examples include: p-methacryloyloxyethyldimethoxy-methyl-silane, y-methacryloyloxy-propylmethoxydimethyl-silane, y-methacryloyloxy-propyldimethoxymethylsilane, y-methacryloyloxypropyl-trimethoxy-silane, y-methacryloyloxy-propylethoxydiethyl-silane, y-methacryloyloxypropyldiethoxymethyl-silane, 8-methacryloyl-oxy-butyldiethoxymethyl-silane or mixtures thereof.<br>
From 0 to 20 wt% of grafting agent may be used, based on the total weight of the silicone rubber.<br>
The silicone rubber may be prepared by emulsion polymerization, as described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,891,920 and 3,294,725. The silicone rubber is thereby obtained in the form of aqueous latex. To that end, a mixture containing organosiloxane, crosslinking agent and optionally grafting agent is mixed with water, under shear, for example by means of a homogenizer, in the presence of an emulsifier based on sulfonic acid, such as, for example, alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or alkylsulfonic acid, the mixture polymerizing completely to form the silicone rubber latex. An alkylbenzenesulfonic acid is particularly suitable because it acts not only as emulsifier but also as polymerization initiator. In this case, a combination of the sulfonic acid with a metal salt of an<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or with a metal salt of an alkylsulfonic acid is advantageous because the polymer is stabilized thereby during the subsequent graft polymerization.<br>
After the polymerization, the reaction is terminated by neutralizing the reaction mixture by addition of an aqueous alkaline solution, for example by addition of an aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution.<br>
Silicone acrylate rubbers (B.2.2) are also suitable as graft bases B.2. These rubbers are composite rubbers having graft-active sites and containing from 10 to 90 wt.% silicone rubber component and from 90 to 10 wt.% polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component, the two mentioned rubber components in the composite rubber interpenetrating so that they cannot substantially be separated from one another.<br>
Silicone acrylate rubbers are known and are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,807,914, and 4,888,388, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable silicone rubber components therefor are those as already described under B.2.1.<br>
Suitable polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber components of the silicone acrylate rubbers according to B.2.2 may be prepared from methacrylic acid alkyl esters and/or acrylic acid alkyl esters, a crosslinking agent and a grafting agent. Examples of preferred methacrylic acid alkyl esters and/or acrylic acid alkyl esters are C1- to C8-alkyl esters, for example methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-propyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-lauryl and 2-ethylhexyl esters; haloalkyl esters, preferably halo-C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as chloroethyl acrylate, as well as mixtures of these monomers. n-Butyl acrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
As crosslinking agents for the polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component of the silicone acrylate rubber there may be used monomers having more than one polymerizable double bond. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids<br>
having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and unsaturated monohydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, or saturated polyols having from 2 to 4 OH groups and from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate and 1,4-butylene glycol dimethacrylate. The crosslinking agents can be used alone or in mixtures of at least two crosslinking agents.<br>
Examples of preferred grafting agents include allyl methacrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate or mixtures thereof. Allyl methacrylate may also be used as crosslinking agent. The grafting agents may be used alone or in mixtures of at least two grafting agents.<br>
The amount of crosslinking agent and grafting agent is from 0.1 to 20 wt.%, based on the total weight of the polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component of the silicone acrylate rubber.<br>
The silicone acrylate rubber may be produced by first preparing the silicone rubber (B.2.1) as aqueous latex. The latex may subsequently be enriched with the methacrylfc acid alkyl esters and/or acrylic acid alkyl esters, the crosslinking agent and the grafting agent, and polymerization is carried out. Preference is given to emulsion polymerization initiated by free radicals, for example by a peroxide, azo or redox initiator. Particular preference is given to the use of a redox initiator system, in particular a sulfoxylate initiator system prepared by combining iron sulfate, disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, rongalite and hydroperoxide.<br>
The grafting agent used in the preparation of the silicone rubber has the effect that the polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component is bonded covalently to the silicone rubber component. In the polymerization, the two rubber components interpenetrate and thus form the composite rubber, which after the polymerization can no longer be separated into its constituents of silicone rubber component and polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber component.<br>
For the preparation of the silicone (acrylate) graft rubbers the monomers B.1 are grafted onto the rubber base B.2.<br>
The polymerization methods are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 4,877,831 and 4,888,388 and EP 430134, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The graft polymerization may be carried out, for example, according to the following polymerization method: In a single- or multi-step emulsion polymerization initiated by free radicals, the desired vinyl monomers B.1 are polymerized onto the graft base, which is in the form of aqueous latex. The grafting efficiency should be as high as possible and is preferably greater than or equal to 10%. The grafting efficiency is substantially dependent on the grafting agent or used. After polymerization to the silicone (acrylate) graft rubber, the aqueous latex is added to hot water in which metal salts have previously been dissolved, such as, for example, calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate. The silicone (acrylate) graft rubber thereby coagulates and may then be separated off.<br>
The methacrylic acid alkyl ester and acrylic acid alkyl ester graft rubbers mentioned as component B) are commercially available, for example Metablen® SX 005 a product of Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd.<br>
The preferred graft (co)polymer suitable in the context of the invention has core/shell morphology. It may be obtained by graft polymerizing alkyl(meth)acrylate and optionally a copolymerizable vinyl monomer onto a composite rubber core. The composite rubber core that includes interpenetrated and inseparable network (IPN) polyorganosiloxane and poly(meth)alkyl acrylate components is characterized in that its glass transition temperature is below 0°C, preferably below -20°C, especially below -40°C.<br>
The preferred core is polysiloxane-alkyl(meth)acrylate interpenetrating network (IPN) type polymer that contains polysiloxane and butylacrylate. The shell is a rigid phase, preferably polymerized of methylmethacrylate. The weight ratio of polysiloxane/alkyl(meth)acrylate/<br>
rigid shell is 70-90/5-15/5-15, preferably 75-85/7-12/7-12, most preferably 80/10/10.<br>
Component C<br>
Phosphorus-containing compounds suitable as flame retardant in the context of the invention include oligomeric organic phosphoric or phosphonic acid esters conforming structurally to formula (IV)<br>
