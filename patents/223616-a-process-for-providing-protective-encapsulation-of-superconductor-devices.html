				<td>The present Invention relates to a process for providing protective<br>
encapsulation of superconductor devices.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to encapsulation of high Tc<br>
superconductor device.<br>
High-Tc superconductors are newly discovered superconducting materials and<br>
several of these show superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature<br>
whereas the conventional low temperature superconductors show<br>
superconductivity only upto 23 K. This discovery of high-Tc superconductors<br>
provides an opportunity to develop high-Tc devices such as SQUIDs, Microwave<br>
Passive Circuits etc. which can be operated at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K).<br>
High Tc superconductor devices have great potentiality for wide spread<br>
application since liquid nitrogen which is used for cooling these devices are very<br>
less expensive<br>
Characteristics of high-Tc superconductors are found to deteriorate as the<br>
superconductors comes in contact with moisture or if there is a loss of oxygen.<br>
For long term operation of a high-Tc superconductor device its characteristics<br>
should not change with time and even after several thermal cyclings from liquid<br>
nitrogen temperature to room temperature. This requirement necessitates the<br>
use of some sort of protective layer over the device so that the working life of the<br>
device may be increased.<br>
A few methods have been proposed in the prior art disclosures to protect high-<br>
Tc superconductors and devices. Reference may be made to a Japanese<br>
patent (JP 020246608, Feb. 1990) by Kawasaki et. al. wherein preparation of<br>
silicon oxide, Al-oxide or oxides of a metal have been disclosed for use over the<br>
superconductors as the protection layer. In this disclosure the main drawback<br>
is that the use of the overcoat layer as mentioned is done by means of physical<br>
vapour deposition. This will essentially damage the superconducting properties<br>
and will need an additional thermal treatment step to recover the desired<br>
characteristics.<br>
In an another disclosure (WO 9003265, April, 1990) by Weaver et. al., a<br>
method comprising of evaporation of Al, Si, AI-W or CaF2 in activated oxygen is<br>
explained. In this disclosure again, the use of physical vapour deposition is<br>
made and use has been made of oxygen atmosphere to compensate for any loss<br>
of oxygen during the deposition process. This then again has a drawback of the<br>
inability to retain the initial characteristics of the superconductor due to the need<br>
to create the passivation layer for encapsulation in an oxygen atmosphere.<br>
Reference may be made to yet another disclosure (WO 9009683 Aug 1990) by<br>
Lyon et al, wherein the inventors have described a method for encapsulating the<br>
high Tc superconductor with a solution of metal which is capable of being<br>
oxidised by the superconductors to form a passivation layer. This method has<br>
the serious drawback of disturbing the stoichiometry and oxygen content of a<br>
high Tc superconductor due to the necessary reaction with the metal solution.<br>
To be able to recover the desired superconducting properties, the system<br>
necessarily has to be heat treated again.<br>
In another disclosure by Imai Komiko (JP 04124002 April 1992), preparation of a<br>
protective layer, by fusing and applying a metal(alloy) containing Bi, Pb, Cu or<br>
noble metals, has been described. Deposition of metal layer or an alloy are not<br>
very suitable for superconducting devices since it can mess up with contact<br>
pads. Moreover, it can also affect the characteristics of the devices which use<br>
junctions.<br>
In some methods top thin layer of high-Tc superconductors are modified to act as<br>
a passivation layer. For example reference maybe made to a disclosure by<br>
Vasquez Richard (US 54501, Feb. 1991) . In this disclosure, surface of a high-<br>
Tc superconductor such as YBCO is passivated by reacting the native Y, Ba, Cu<br>
metal ions with ions such as sulfate or an oxalate. This passivation treatment is<br>
done by dipping the superconductor in dilute aqueous solution.<br>
In another patent disclosure (US 5130295, August 1992) Labib has disclosed<br>
preparation of thin layer of mixed phase of YBa2Cu3O7 on the top of YBCO. This<br>
essentially means repeating the process of preparation of the high Tc system on<br>
top of already prepared device.<br>
In a patent disclosure by Gorsshkov (SU 1832135, August 1993) formation of a<br>
passivation layer by Argon ion bombardment is described to protect Bi-Sr-Ca-<br>
Cu-O film. These methods of the modification of the thin top layer of high-Tc<br>
superconductors are not suitable for thin film high-Tc devices, since such<br>
modifications can affect the characteristics of the device due to modification of<br>
structure and stoichiometry on the surface.<br>
In an European patent (EP 484010, May 1992) Josefowicz et. al. have revealed<br>
that a passivation layer comprising of a first layer of group II oxides such as<br>
MgO and second layer of polymide can be created on top of the device . In this<br>
process after deposition of MgO heat treatments at elevated temperatures are<br>
needed which again does not guarantee the recovery of the superconducting<br>
properties in a post deposition situation.<br>
Preparation of SrTiO3 (STO) layer on high Tc film has also been disclosed in an<br>
US patent (US 657203, September 2000). In this process also STO layer is<br>
prepared at an elevated temperature which may not suit to some high-Tc devices<br>
in much the same way as has been mentioned above in respect of inventions of<br>
the prior art, as disclosed above.<br>
In several of the above mentioned process heating is done at an elevated<br>
temperature in excess of 800 ° C which does not suit to high-Tc devices such as<br>
SQUIDs, Josephson Junction, where, a fine microbridge is fabricated. This is<br>
due to the fact that high temperature treatment can modify the device<br>
properties. Moreover in the above mentioned process, high-Tc devices along<br>
with the protection layer is in direct contact with the liquid nitrogen during<br>
operation at 77 K. This can affect the life of device. Moreover, there is<br>
deposition of moisture on the protection layer during warming up of the device<br>
from 77 K to room temperature. Several thermal cycling can cause cracks in<br>
the protection layer and can also damage the contacts which can result in the<br>
failure of the device. What is required that once a high-Tc device is made the<br>
passivation/encapsulation process should not change the device characteristics.<br>
In the present invention a simple and novel process is described in which no<br>
change in superconducting properties of the device occurs during the process of<br>
protection and encapsulation and long life of high-Tc device is ensured by<br>
avoiding direct contact with external atmosphere.<br>
Main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for providing<br>
protective encapsulation of superconductor devices which obviates the<br>
drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process of protective<br>
encapsulation of high Tc superconductor devices.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process of protective<br>
encapsulation without the need of any post deposition high temperature<br>
treatment and oxygen treatment.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process of protective<br>
encapsulation to give superconductor device characteristics stable for at least<br>
36 months with multiple thermal cycling between room temperature and liquid<br>
nitrogen temperature .<br>
A process for providing protective encapsulation of high-Tc superconductor<br>
devices is disclosed. This process consists of two steps. In the first step, a<br>
coating by conventional spin coating technique of uniform layer of photoresist on<br>
top of the superconductor device is carried out. The spun coated photoresist<br>
layer is hardened by annealing it at 80-100°C for 30 minutes. In the second<br><br><br>
may be such as helium<br><br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the encapsulated device<br>
obtained may have a stability of at least 36 months with multiple thermal cycling<br>
between room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the stability of the temperature<br>
of the encapsulated device may be achieved in about 1 min.<br>
High-Tc superconductors are very susceptible to moisture and this leads to<br>
deterioration of the characteristics of high-Tc superconductors devices. The<br>
present invention provides a process for protection of high-Tc superconductor<br>
devices which ensures a long life of the device.<br>
The present encapsulation method consist of two steps. In the first step<br>
preferably a photo resist, is coated on the high-Tc superconductor device.<br>
Coating of photo resist is done after the high-Tc device is fabricated and metal<br>
contact pads have been prepared. In order to prepare a uniform layer of photo<br>
resist one drop of photo resist (AZ 1470) is put on the top of the superconducting<br>
film device and is spun using a spinner at a preferred speed of 3000 rpm for<br>
one minute. This leads to a deposition of about one micron thick photo resist<br>
layer on the superconductor device. This device with the photo resist layer is<br>
baked at a temperature in the range of 80-100°C preferably for 30 minutes.<br>
The preferred temperature of baking is 90 °C. This heat treatment hardens the<br>
photo resist layer and also leads to good adherence with the superconducting<br>
device.<br>
During the second step, the device is encapsulated preferably in a copper<br>
cavity in pure Helium gas atmosphere. For the encapsulation, superconducting<br>
device is placed on the bottom of the circular copper cavity (1) of 2 cm diameter<br>
and 1 cm height and contacts are made through vacuum tight feed throughs<br>
which are fixed on the top cover of the cavity box. The cover of the box has two<br>
1" long copper tubes of 2 millimeter diameter. These are used for creating<br>
vacuum in the box and for filling the helium gas respectively. The cover is fixed<br>
on the copper cavity using araldite. The thickness of the araldite is optimally<br>
fixed to give crack free coating for effective sealing. The thickness selected is<br>
critical to avoid any development of cracks during thermal cyclings. The copper<br>
cavity is evacuated through a rotary pump for 30 minutes and helium gas is<br>
flushed in. This process is repeated 2-3 times and finally after filling helium gas<br>
at the pressure of 3 Bar, the copper tubes are sealed by pinching it. The<br>
process described in the present invention do not lead to any change in the<br>
superconducting properties of the encapsulated superconductor device. The<br>
device shows the same characteristics even after several thermal cycling from<br>
room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature for a long period of operation.<br>
Figure 1 shows result of a high-Tc superconducting quantum interference device<br>
(SQUID) which has been encapsulated following the present process and has<br>
been tested over a period of 36 months. After each cooling to liquid nitrogen<br>
temperature (77K), SQUID peak to peak voltage and SQUID noise at 1 Hz are<br>
measured. These two characteristics; SQUID peak -peak voltage and SQUID<br>
noise are very important parameters of a SQUID device and directly related with<br>
the superconducting properties such as critical current, critical temperature etc.<br>
Even a slight change in the superconducting properties will change the peak to<br>
peak voltage or noise of the SQUID. It is evident from figure 1 that the<br>
characteristics of the high-T c SQUID do not change even after several thermal<br>
cycling over a long period. This shows that the present method is very<br>
successful in protecting high-T c device from degradation.<br>
The scientific principle underlying the scheme of passivation is to prevent<br>
interaction of moisture and reactive gases with the superconductor device. It is<br>
the interaction of these environmental parameters which leads to surface level<br>
changes which result in degradation of the properties and long term usability.<br>
Further, the repeated thermal cyclings between croygenic temperatures and<br>
room temperature lead to generation of thermal shocks to the device which<br>
obviously results in micro mechanical damages to the devices and hence<br>
damage the device itself. Thus, in order to prevent the devices from such<br>
harmful conditions the passivation layers are to be used in conjunction with<br>
housing of the device in a suitable enclosure having adequate means of thermal<br>
conduction between the cryogen and the device for effective cooling for the<br>
device to operate. The use of a photo resist or a polymer for that matter serves<br>
this very purpose in conjunction with the copper cavity having a small amount of<br>
helium gas to maintain the device at low temperature during cooling cycle and<br>
subsequent operation.<br>
The novelty of the invention lies in the avoidance of use of any high<br>
temperature processing for providing protective coating and use of any gas for<br>
maintaining the superconductor properties for effecting<br>
passivation/encapsulation as in the prior art.<br>
This novelty is achieved by use of spin coating and baking of a thin layer of a<br>
polymer on the superconducting device and further encapsulating the coated<br>
device in an enclosure capable of providing a non reactive oxygen free<br>
atmosphere provided by the presence of an inert gas at pressure not exceeding<br>
3 bar.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
An Bi2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu 3 O x SQUID device with already made electrical contacts<br>
was taken. The device was kept on a Headway photo resist spinner vacuum<br>
chuck and was held in position by vacuum by means of a rotary vacuum pump. A<br>
drop of positive photo resist ( Shipley AZ 1470 photo resist) was put at the<br>
center of the device and spun. The spinning speed was selected for 3000 rpm<br>
for a time of 60 seconds. After the spinner stopped the device was carefully<br>
removed from the spinner chuck by releasing air in the vacuum line and then put<br>
in an oven set at a temperature of 90° C. The baking was done for a time of one<br>
hour. The device so coated had a hardened overcoat of photo resist.<br>
This coated device was then fixed to the bottom of a copper cavity circular in<br>
nature having a diameter of 2 cm and a height of 1 cm. Next the leads of the<br>
device were soldered to the four electrical vacuum feed throughs in a circular<br>
plate of copper of 2 mm thickness and 2 cms. diameter by carefully<br>
keeping the wires intact. This circular copper plate has two inlet pipes which are<br>
used for feeding helium gas and evacuation, respectively. Next, the circular plate<br>
was set on open portion of the cavity and araldite was applied for two times by<br>
means of fine brush. The sealed structure was then allowed to cure at room<br>
temperature for about 24 hours. After the curing a rotary vacuum pump is<br>
connected to one inlet on the circular plate and the other inlet connected to a<br>
helium gas line without the gas pressure . Evacuation is done for about 1/2<br>
hr and the pump is disconnected for a while. Helium is purged in the cavity. Next<br>
the gas line is closed and the vacuum line is opened again to remove the gas.<br>
This sequential operation is done for 3 times when finally the gas is bled under<br>
throttle under vacuum and as the pressure of helium in the cavity is seen to<br>
stabilise at 3 Bar, the two inlets are simultaneously sealed by pinching. This way<br>
the encapsulation was completed.<br>
Example-2<br>
Peak - peak voltage of the encapsulated SQUID device was used to measure at<br>
a temperature of 77 K. The SQUID Voltage was 5 mV as measured immediately<br>
after the encapsulation. The SQUID voltage was then measured subsequently<br>
after a regular interval of 15 days for seven months. There was no measurable<br>
change in the SQUID voltage of 5 mV.<br>
Example-3<br>
Peak - peak voltage of the encapsulated SQUID device of example -1 was used<br>
to measure the SQUID voltage. The device was stored in ambient atmosphere<br>
at room temperature for twenty months and then the measurements were taken.<br>
The SQUID Voltage observed was 5 mV as that when the device was first<br>
encapsulated.<br>
Example-4<br>
The encapsulated device was taken to measure the flux noise at a frequency of<br>
1 Hz., immediately after encapsulation. The flux noise was 1 x10"3ct&gt;o/V Hz. The<br>
flux noise was measured for six months at an interval of one month. It was<br>
observed that the value remained the same for the period under mention.<br>
The main advantages of the invention are:<br>
1. The device does not come in direct contact with liquid nitrogen thereby<br>
avoiding any affect of boiling nitrogen on the device and its electrical<br>
contacts.<br>
2. During the heating cycle to room temperature there is no moisture<br>
condensation on the device.<br>
3. Since helium gas is filled inside the copper enclosure with a gas tight<br>
sealing the device can be cooled even close to liquid helium temperature.<br>
4. The encapsulated superconductor device attains the temperature of<br>
operation in a short interval of about 1 min.<br>
5. The encapsulated superconductor device is capable of use for long<br>
periods of at least 36 months with multiple thermal cycling between room<br>
temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
