RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]        This application claims priority to USSN 60/878,018, filed December 28,<br>
2006, and USSN 60/941,596, filed June 1, 2007, both of which are hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]        The present invention generally relates to cyclopamine analogs and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods for preparing such analogs and<br>
compositions. These compounds and compositions are useful for the treatment of<br>
disorders mediated by the hedgehog pathway, such as cancer.<br>
[0003]        Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway in certain cancers has been shown to<br>
result in inhibition of tumor growth. For example, anti-hedgehog antibodies have been<br>
shown to antagonize the function of the hedgehog pathway and inhibit the growth of<br>
tumors. Small molecule inhibition of hedgehog pathway activity has also been shown to<br>
result in cell death in a number of cancer types.<br>
[0004]        Research in this area has focused primarily on the elucidation of hedgehog<br>
pathway biology and the discovery of new hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Although<br>
inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway have been identified, there still exists the need to<br>
identify more potent inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway.<br>
[0005]  PCT publication WO 2006/026430 published 9 March 2006 and assigned to<br>
the same assignee as the present application, discloses a wide variety of cyclopamine<br>
analogs, focusing on those with unsaturation in the A or B ring. In the present<br>
application, the surprisingly potent analogs contain completely saturated A and B rings.<br>

fewer. Likewise, certain cycloalkyls have from 3-10 carbon atoms in their ring structure,<br>
and others have 5, 6 or 7 carbons in the ring structure.<br>
[0036]        The term "alkylthio" refers to an alkyl group, as defined above, having a<br>

adjoining rings (the rings are "fused rings") wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic,<br>
e.g., the other cyclic rings may be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or<br>
heterocyclyls.<br>
[0041]        The term "Bronsted acid" refers to any substance that can act as a<br>

on the alkyl portion such as   and its isomers.<br>
[0044]        The term "haloalkyl", as used herein, refers to an alkyl group where<br>
anywhere from 1 to all hydgrogens have been replaced with a halide. A "perhaloalkyl" is<br>
where all of the hydrogens have been replaced with a halide.<br>
[0045]        The term "heteroatom" as used herein means an atom of any element other<br>
man carbon or hydrogen. Examples of heteroatoms include boron, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
phosphorus, sulfur and selenium.<br>
[0046]        The terms "heterocyclyl" or "heterocyclic group" refer to 3- to 10-<br>
membered ring structures, in some instances from 3- to 7-membered rings, whose ring<br>

The heterocyclic ring may be substituted at one or more positions with such substituents<br>
as described above, as for example, halogen, alkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
hydroxyl, amino, nitro, sulfhydryl, imino, amido, phosphonate, phosphinate, carbonyl,<br>
carboxyl, silyl, ether, alkylthio, sulfonyl, ketone, aldehyde, ester, a heterocyclyl, an<br>
aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety, -CF3, -CN, or the like.<br>
[0047]        The term "isolated" in connection with a compound of the present<br>
invention means the compound is not in a cell or organism and the compound is separated<br>
from some or all of the components that typically accompany it in nature.<br>
[0048]        The term "Lewis acid" refers to any substance that can act as an electron<br>
pair acceptor.<br><br>
[0049]        Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower alkyl" as used<br>
herein means an alkyl group, as defined above, but having from one to ten carbons, in<br>
some embodiments from one to six carbon atoms in its backbone structure. Likewise,<br>
"lower alkenyl" and "lower alkynyl" have similar chain lengths. Certain alkyl groups are<br>
lower alkyls. In some embodiments, a substituent designated herein as alkyl is a lower<br>
alkyl.<br>
[0050]        As used herein, the term "nitro" means -NO2; the term "halogen"<br>
designates -F, -Cl, -Br or -I; the term "sulfhydryl" means -SH; the term "hydroxyl" means<br>
-OH; and the term "sulfonyl" means -SO2-.<br>
[0051]       The term "oxo" refers to a carbonyl oxygen (=O).<br>
[0052]        The terms "polycyclyl" or "polycyclic group" refer to two or more rings<br>
(e.g., cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls) in which two<br>
or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings, e.g., the rings are "fused rings".<br>
Rings that are joined through non-adjacent atoms are termed "bridged" rings. Each of the<br>
rings of the polycycle may be substituted with such substituents as described above, as for<br>
example, halogen, alkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxyl, amino, nitro,<br>
sulfhydryl, imino, amido, phosphonate, phosphinate, carbonyl, carboxyl, silyl, ether,<br>

moiety, -CF3, -CN, or the like.<br>
[0053]        The term "epimerically pure" in connection with a compound of the<br>
present invention means that the compound is substantially free of stereoisomers of the<br>
compound wherein the configuration of the stereogenic center that R3 is bonded to is<br>
inverted. For example an epimerically pure compound represented by the following<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R7, R7, R8, and R9 are as defined below, is substantially free of<br>
compounds represented by the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R7, R7, R8, and R9 are as defined below. Epimerically pure<br>
compounds contain less than about 20 % by mass, less than about 15% by mass, less than<br>
about 10% by mass, less than about 5% by mass, or less than about 3% by mass of<br>
stereoisomeric compounds wherein the configuration of the stereogenic center that R3 is<br>
bonded to is inverted relative to the compound.<br>
[0054]        The phrase "protecting group" as used herein means temporary<br>
substituents which protect a potentially reactive functional group from undesired<br>
chemical transformations. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of<br>
carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones,<br>
respectively. The field of protecting group chemistry has been reviewed (Greene, T.W.;<br>
Wuts, P.G.M Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991).<br>
In some cases, the functional group being protected and the protecting group are together<br>
referred to as one moiety. For example, the fragment shown below is sometimes referred<br>
to as a benzyl carbonate; i.e., the protected (underlined) O makes up part of the carbonate.<br><br>
[0055]        Similarly, the fragment shown below, in which the protected N makes up<br>
part of the carbamate, is referred to as a benzyl carbamate.<br><br><br>
[0056]       The term "sugar" as used herein refers to a natural or an unnatural<br>
monosaccharide, disaccharide or oligosaccharide comprising one or more pyranose or<br>
furanose rings. The sugar may be covalently bonded to the steroidal alkaloid of the<br>
present invention through an ether linkage or through an alkyl linkage. In certain<br>
embodiments the saccharide moiety may be covalently bonded to a steroidal alkaloid of<br>
the present invention at an anomeric center of a saccharide ring. Sugars may include, but<br>
are not limited to ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, glucose, mannose,<br>
gulose, idose, galactose, talose, glucose, and trehalose.<br>
[0057]        The term "sulfonamido" or "sulfonamide" as used herein includes a<br>
moiety having either of the following formulae:<br><br>
wherein R50 and R56 are as defined above.<br>
[0058]        The terms "triflyl", "tosyl", "mesyl", and "nonaflyl" refer to<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, methanesulfonyl, and<br>
nonafluorobutanesulfonyl groups, respectively. The terms "triflate", "tosylate",<br>
"mesylate", and "nonaflate" to trifluoromethanesulfonate ester, p-toluenesulfonate ester,<br>
methanesulfonate ester, and nonafluorobutanesulfonate ester functional groups and<br>
molecules that contain the groups, respectively.<br>
[0059]        The term "thioxo" refers to a carbonyl sulfur (=S).<br>
[0060]        It will be understood that "substitution" or "substituted with" includes the<br>
implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the<br>
substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable<br>
compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by<br>
rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc.<br>
[0061]        Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in particular<br>
geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention contemplates all such<br>
compounds, including cis- and frans-isomers, R- and 5-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-<br>
isorners, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling<br><br>
within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in<br>
a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are<br>
intended to be included in this invention.<br>
[0062]        As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds may<br>
contain a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of<br>
forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable acids. The<br>
term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic,<br>
inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These<br>
salts can be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form<br>
manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in<br>
its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus<br>
formed during subsequent purification. Representative salts include the hydrobromide,<br>
hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate,<br>
stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate,<br>
succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and<br>
laurylsulphonate salts and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al. (1977) "Pharmaceutical<br>
Salts", J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19)<br>
[0063]        The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present<br>
invention include the conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the<br>
compounds, e.g., from non-toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example, such<br>
conventional nontoxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the<br>
salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic,<br>
lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic,<br>
glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like.<br>
[0064]        In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or<br>
more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable bases. The term "pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and<br>
organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can<br><br>
likewise be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form<br>
manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid<br>
form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a<br>
pharmaceutieally-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline<br>
earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum<br>
salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base<br>
addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, emylenediamine, ethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al, supra)<br>
Svnmesis of Steroidal Alkaloid Compounds<br>
[0065]        The ring expanded steroidal alkaloid derivatives described above can be<br>
prepared directly from naturally occurring steroidal alkaloids or synthetic analogs thereof.<br>
In certain instances, the steroidal alkaloid starting materials can be cyclopamine or<br>
jervine. These steroidal alkaloids can be purchased commercially or extracted from<br>
Veratrum Californicum. Briefly, the process of the present invention comprises the steps<br>
of cyclopropanating suitable starting steroidal alkaloid derivatives followed by ring<br>
expansion rearrangement of the cyclopropyl derivatives. In some instances, it may be<br>
desirable to suitably protect or otherwise transform reactive functionalities present on the<br>
molecule prior to cyclopropanation. For example, an alcohol present at R1 and a<br>
secondary nitrogen present on the fused furano-piperidine ring can both be protected prior<br>
to cyclopropanation. In certain embodiments, protecting groups that are efficiently added<br>
and removed from the alkaloid, yield intermediates in the synmetic process with<br>
improved handling properties and which allow for the efficient purification of me<br>
synthetic intermediates formed may be preferred.<br>
[0066]        Examples of oxygen protecting groups include, but are not limited to<br>
formate, acetate, chloroacetate, dichloroacetate, trichloroacetate, pivaloate, benzoates,<br>
alkyl carbonate, alkenyl carbonate, aryl carbonates, aralkyl carbonate (e.g., benzyl<br>
carbonate), 2,2,2-trichloroethyl carbonate, alkoxymethyl ether, aralkoxymethyl ether,<br>
alkylthiomethl ether, aralkylthio ether, arylthio ether, trialkylsilyl ether, alkylarylsilyl<br>
ether, benzyl ether, arylmethyl ether, and allyl ether.<br><br>
[0067]        Examples of nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not limited to<br>
formyl, chloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, phenyl acetyl, benzoyls, benzamides,<br>
alkyl carbamates, aralkyl carbamates (e.g., benzyl carbamates), aryl carbamates, allyl,<br>
aralkyl, alkoxymethyl, aralkoxymethyl, N-2-cyanoethyl, diarylphosphinamides,<br>
dialkylphosphinamidates, diarylphosphinamidates, and trialkylsilyl.<br>
[0068]        Additional protecting groups that may be used in the methods of the<br>
present invention are described in Green T.W.; Wuts P.G. Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999.<br>
[0069]        A variety of cyclopropanating agents can be used to cyclopropanate the<br>
steroidal alkaloid. 1,1-haloalkylmetal complexes and reactive species referred to as<br>
carbenoids, are commonly used to cyclopropanate olefins. These reagents are typically<br>
made using a diiodoalkane or diazoalkane and a metal or organometalic species such as<br>
Et2Zn, iBU3Al, samarium, copper, rhodium, or palladium. In certain embodiments, Et2Zn<br>
and diiodomethane are used to generate the 1,1-haloalkylmetal species.<br>
[0070]        The reactivity and the ease of handling of the 1,1-haloalkylzinc complexes<br>
can be modified by the addition of certain reagents, such as acids. It is believed that the<br>
addition of an acid to the 1,1-haloalkylzinc species generates an alkyl zinc mixed salt. In<br>
the examples described below a biarylphosphoric acid is combined with diiodomethane<br>
and diethylzinc to generate a putative haloalkyl zinc phosphate cyclopropanating agent. A<br>
variety of phosphoric acids can be used to generate the putative haloalkylzinc phosphate.<br>
[0071]        Other known cyclopropanation methods such as those utilizing sulfur<br>
ylides to react with an olefin conjugated to a carbonyl to add a CH2 or CH-alkyl or CH-<br>
aryl group, and metal-catalyzed decomposition of diazoalkyl and a-diazo-carbonyl<br>
compounds, such as diazomethane and ethyl diazoacetate, can also be used: these<br>
methods readily provide cyclopropanes having alkyl, aryl, alkoxycarbonyl (-COOR), or<br>
acyl substituents. Additional cyclopropanating agents are described in Masalov et al.,<br>
Organic Letters (2004) Vol. 6, pp. 2365-8 and Hansen et al., Chem. Comm. (2006) 4838-<br>
4O.<br>
[0072]        The cyclopropyl ring may be substituted or unsubstituted. In cases where<br>
the cyclopropyl ring is substituted, the groups attached to the methylene of the<br>
cyclopropane will be installed onto the D ring after rearrangement and ring expansion.<br><br>
[0073]       The cyclopropanation reactions may be conducted in an aprotic solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents include ethers, such as diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diglyme, t-<br>
butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like; halogenated solvents, such as<br>
chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and the like; aliphatic or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvents, such as benzene, xylene, toluene, hexane, pentane and the like;<br>
esters and ketones, such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and 2-butanone; polar aprotic solvents,<br>
such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and the like; or combinations<br>
of two or more solvents. In a certain embodiments, dichloromethane is the solvent used<br>
for me cyclopropanation when a dialkyl zinc and diiodomethane is used.<br>
[0074]        In the examples described below, a solution containing the<br>
cyclopropanating agent is prepared by first adding a solution of a phosphoric acid to a<br>
solution of diethylzinc, followed by addition of diiodomethane to the reaction solution.<br>
The cyclopropanation substrate is then added to this solution. Alternatively, the<br>
cyclopropanation agent can be prepared in the presence of the cyclopropanation substrate<br>
by changing the order of addition of the reagents. In certain embodiments, the<br>
cyclopropanation reaction is conducted by first adding the phosphoric acid to a solution<br>
of dialkylzinc, followed by the addition of the cyclopropanation substrate, and finally the<br>
dihaloalkane is added. Using this method the cyclopropanating agent is generated under<br>
controlled conditions and immediately reacts with the cyclopropanation substrate. The<br>
cyclopropanation methods described herein can also be used to cyclopropanate other<br>
polycyclic compounds, for example, those with steroidal backbones.<br>
[0075]        Following synthesis of the cyclopropanated steroidal alkaloid core, the<br>
compound may be derivatized using a variety of functionalization reactions known in the<br>
art. Representative examples include palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or<br>
aryl halides, oxidations, reductions, reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with<br>
electrophiles, pericyclic reactions, radical reactions, installation of protecting groups,<br>
removal of protecting groups, and the like.<br>
[0076]        In the presence of Lewis or Bronsted acids the cyclopropyl analogs<br>
undergo a rearrangement and ring expansion to afford steroidal alkaloid analogs in which<br>
the D ring has been expanded by one carbon.<br><br>
[0077]        The cyclopropanation and ring expansion can take place in a two-step one<br>
reaction vessel process or in a two-step two reaction vessel process. When the<br>
cyclopropanation and ring expansion are conducted in the same reaction vessel the acid<br>
used to initiate the ring expansion rearrangement is added after completion of the<br>
cyclopropanation reaction. Under certain conditions, the zinc salts that are generated in<br>
the course of cyclopropanating the steroidal alkaloid can themselves act as Lewis acids to<br>
catalyze the ring expansion rearrangement. The reactivity of the zinc salts generated after<br>
the cyclopropanation can be modified by the addition of acids to generate more active<br>
Lewis acids.<br>
[0078]        As described below in the examples section, the methanesulfonic acid is<br>
added to the cyclopropanation reaction vessel after completion of the cyclopropanation.<br>
Additional examples of suitable acids include, but are not limited to zinc salts, boron<br>
compounds, magnesium salts, titanium salts, indium salts, aluminum salts, tin salts,<br>
lanthanum salts, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, diaryloxyphosporic acids, acetic acid, and<br>
HC1. In a certain embodiments of the invention the Lewis acid used is a zinc salt or BF3.<br>
[0079]        These ring expanded analogs may be further functionalized using a variety<br>
of functionalization reactions known in the art. Representative examples include<br>
palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or aryl halides, oxidations, reductions,<br>
reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with electrophiles, pericyclic reactions, radical<br>
reactions, installation of protecting groups, removal of protecting groups, and the like.<br>
Utility of Compounds<br>
[0080]        Hedgehog signaling is essential in many stages of development, especially<br>
in formation of left-right symmetry. Loss or reduction of hedgehog signaling leads to<br>
multiple developmental deficits and malformations, one of the most striking of which is<br>
cyclopia.<br>
[0081]        Many tumors and proliferative conditions have been shown to depend on<br>
the hedgehog pathway. The growth of such cells and survival can be affected by<br>
treatment with the compounds of the present invention. Recently, it has been reported that<br>
activating hedgehog pathway mutations occur in sporadic basal cell carcinoma (Xie et al.<br>
(1998) Nature 391: 9O-2) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous<br><br>
system (Reifenberger et al. (1998) Cancer Res 58: 1798-803). Uncontrolled activation of<br>
the hedgehog pathway has also been shown in numerous cancer types such as GI tract<br>
cancers including pancreatic, esophageal, gastric cancer (Berman et al. (2003) Nature<br>
425: 846-51, Thayer et al. (2003) Nature 425: 851-56) lung cancer (Watkins et al. (2003)<br>
Nature 422: 313-317, prostate cancer (Karhadkar etal (2004) Nature 431: 707-12, Sheng<br>
et al. (2004) Molecular Cancer 3: 29-42, Fan et al. (2004) Endocrinology 145: 3961-70),<br>
breast cancer (Kubo et al. (2004) Cancer Research 64: 6071-74, Lewis et al. (2004)<br>
Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia 2: 165-181) and hepatocellular<br>
cancer (Sicklick et al. (2005) ASCO conference, Mohini et al. (2005) AACR conference).<br>
[0082]        For example, small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog pathway has been<br>
shown to inhibit the growth of basal cell carcinoma (Williams, et ah, 2003 PNAS 100:<br>
4616-21), medulloblastoma (Berman et al, 2002 Science 297: 1559-61), pancreatic<br>
cancer (Berman et al., 2003 Nature 425: 846-51), gastrointestinal cancers (Berman et al.,<br>
2003 Nature 425: 846-51, published PCT application WO 05/013800), esophageal cancer<br>
(Berman et al, 2003 Nature 425: 846-51), lung cancer (Watkins et al., 2003. Nature 422:<br>
313-7), and prostate cancer (Karhadkar et al., 2004. Nature 431: 707-12).<br>
[0083]        In addition, it has been shown that many cancer types have uncontrolled<br>
activation of the hedgehog pathway, for example, breast cancer (Kubo et al., 2004.<br>
Cancer Research 64: 6071-4), heptacellular cancer (Patil et al, 2005. 96th Annual AACR<br>
conference, abstract #2942 Sicklick et al, 2005. ASCO annual meeting, abstract #9610),<br>
hematological malignancies (Watkins and Matsui, unpublished results), basal carcinoma<br>
(Bale &amp; Yu, 2001. Human Molec. Genet. 10:757-762 Xie et al, 1998 Nature 391: 90-92),<br>
medulloblastoma (Pietsch et al, 1997. Cancer Res. 57: 2085-88), and gastric cancer (Ma<br>
et al, 2005 Carcinogenesis May 19, 2005 (Epub)). As shown in the Examples, the<br>
compounds disclosed herein have been shown to modulate the hedgehog pathway, and<br>
selected compounds have been shown to inhibit tumor growth. It is therefore believed<br>
that these compounds can be useful to treat a variety of conditions, such as various<br>
cancers.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0084]        In another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or<br>
more of the compounds described above, formulated together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in<br>
solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration,<br>
for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g.,<br>
those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption, capsules, boluses,<br>
powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for<br>
example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection as, for<br>
example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; (3) topical<br>
application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray<br>
applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or<br>
foam; (5) sublingually; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; (8) pulmonarily, or (9) nasally.<br>
[0085]        Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be<br>
employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol,<br>
polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and<br>
suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters,<br>
such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating<br>
materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of<br>
dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
[0086]        These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives,<br>
wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, lubricants, and/or antioxidants.<br>
Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for<br>
example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be<br>
desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the<br>
compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form<br><br>
may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as<br>
aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[0087]        Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step<br>
of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and,<br>
optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared<br>
by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present<br>
invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if<br>
necessary, shaping the product.<br>
[0088]        When the compounds of the present invention are administered as<br>
pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing, for example, about 0.1 to 99%, or about 10 to 50%, or about 10<br>
to 40%, or about 10 to 30, or about 10 to 20%, or about 10 to 15% of active ingredient in<br>
combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[0089]       Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the<br>
active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a<br>
particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the<br>
patient.<br>
[0090]        The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including<br>
the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester,<br>
salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of<br>
excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent<br>
of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials<br>
used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight,<br>
condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like<br>
factors well known in the medical arts.<br>
[0091]       In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be<br>
that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic<br>
effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above.<br>
Generally, oral, intravenous and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of the present<br>
invention for a patient, when used for the indicated effects, will range from about 0.0001<br><br>
to about 100 mg, or about 0.001 to about 100 rag, or about 0.01 to about 100 mg, or about<br>
0.1 to about 100 mg per, or about 1 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.<br>
[0092]        The subject receiving this treatment is any animal in need, including<br>
primates, in particular humans, and other mammals such as equines, cattle, swine and<br>
sheep; and poultry and pets in general.<br>

under nitrogen, and the filtrate is washed with a 2 % (wt/wt) aqueous solution of<br>
ethylenediamine (125 mL) then water (130 mL), and then dried over sodium sulfate. The<br>
drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated to dryness under<br><br>
vacuum. The solids that remained are chased with toluene (2 x 55 mL) on the rotary<br>
evaporator and the resulting material used without further purification in the next step<br>

(3.0 g).<br><br><br>
[0147] Solid bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl) hydrogenphosphate and 24a are pre-dried and<br>
placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Neat diethyl zinc (722 mg) is charged to an appropriately<br>
sized reaction vessel containing DCM (9.0 g). DCM solutions of the phosphate (1.83 g in 17.9<br>
g) and IPI-332690 (1.34 g in 3.6 g) are added sequentially at or below 25 °C. Diiodomethane<br>

-45°C and a solution of methanesulfonic acid in DCM (566 mg in 1.5 g) is charged. After 15<br>
minutes, morpholine (1.711 g) is added and the mixture is allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature overnight. The organic layer is washed twice with 2N HC1 (2 x 13.6 g) then<br>
sequentially with 4.8 wt % sodium carbonate (aq), 4.8 wt% sodium sulfite (aq), and 4.8 wt%<br>
brine (13.6 g each). The organic layer is dried, filtered, concentrated to 4 g and diluted with<br>
isopropanol (4 g). The product is crystallized from solution by the slow addition of methanol<br>
(9.3 g). Filtration with a methanol rinse (2.6 g) and drying afford 1.o9 g of 24b (79% isolated<br>

[0148] Johnson Matthey Pd/C catalyst A-3o5o38-5 (890 mg) is charged to an<br>
appropriately sized reaction vessel, followed by 24b (2.24 g). The reaction vessel is purged<br>
with N2 and toluene (21.8 g) and 2-propanol (6.7 g) are added sequentially. The system is<br>
degassed and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the process is repeated with hydrogen.<br>
The system is stirred vigorously and the hydrogen blanket is maintained at one atmosphere for<br>
4-5 hours. The reaction is monitor by either TLC or HPLC. If incomplete, the reaction is<br><br>
inerted, additional catalyst (145 mg) is charged, and the hydrogen atmosphere is returned for<br>
another hour. Ethylenediamine (12.9 mg) is charged and the mixture was stirred for 15<br>
minutes. The catalyst is removed by filtration with a toluene:IPA (3:1) rinse. The filtrate and<br>

and the reaction mixture is heated at 75°C with vigorous stirring for 16-18 hours. The<br>
reaction is quenched by the addition of aqueous Rochelle's salt (2.6 g in 10.3 g water) and the<br>
mixture vigorously stirred for one hour at 45 °C. The aqueous and organic layers are<br>
separated. The aqueous layer is back extracted with a mixture of toluene (2.9 g) and EtoAc<br>
(2.9 g). The organic layers are combined and washed with fresh Rochelle's salt solution (2.6 g<br>
in 10.3 g water) and then with water (12.9 g). The resulting organic layer is dried over<br>
sodium sulfate (1.97 g), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The product is crystallized via a<br>
charge and concentration solvent exchange first to IRA (6.5 g) and then Heptane (7.7 g). The<br>

atmospheric pressure for 8 hours. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst is removed by<br>
filtration through o.2 micron media, rinsing with ACN (1.4 ml). The filtrate and rinse are<br>
combined in a clean reaction vessel equipped with mechanical stirring, an internal temperature<br>
probe, and a nitrogen atmosphere. A solution of citric acid (3.7 g) in water (9.2 ml) is charged<br>
to the reaction vessel at or below 30°C, and IPI-335589 is allowed to slowly crystallize from<br>
solution as the citrate salt at 20 and then 0°C. The crystalline product is recovered by suction<br>
filtration and washed with water (3.7 ml). After drying, the citrate salt, 24e, is isolated as a<br>

slowly added to the reaction vessel to control the internal temperature at -65±5°C. The<br>
reaction is stirred for 2 hours and warmed to -20°C over approximately 1 hour and stirred for<br>
an additional hour. The reaction is monitored by HPLC and reactions that are incomplete are<br>
driven to completion with additional K-selectride. The reaction is quenched at low<br>
temperature with MeOH (0.33 g), then 3M NaOH (2.4 g) at -20°C and 15% hydrogen<br>
peroxide in water (1.04 g) at or below 5°C, then stirring overnight at ambient temperatures.<br>

but a lot of starting material remained. The slurry was filtered through 0.2 micron Acrodisc,<br>
washed with 2-propanol. The filtrate solution was re-subjected to the reaction condition by<br>
adding 54 mg of catalyst. The reaction was completed after 3 h. The slurry was filtered<br>

Example 28: Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway in cell culture<br>
[0171] Hedgehog pathway specific cancer cell killing effects may be ascertained using<br>
the following assay. C3H10T1/2 cells differentiate into osteoblasts when contacted with the<br><br>
sonic hedgehog peptide (Shh-N). Upon differentiation; these osteoblasts produce high levels<br>
of alkaline phosphatase (AP) which can be measured in an enzymatic assay (Nakamura et al,<br>
1997 BBRC 237: 465). Compounds that block the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 into<br>
osteoblasts (a Shh dependent event) can therefore be identified by a reduction in AP<br>
production (van der Horst et al, 2003 Bone 33: 899).    The assay details are described below.<br>
The results approximate (EC50 for inhibition) of the differentiation assay is shown below in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Assay Protocol<br>
Cell Culture<br>
[0172] Mouse embryonic mesoderm fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 cells (obtained from<br>
ATCC) were cultured in Basal MEM Media (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat<br>
inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50ug/ml streptomycin<br>
(Gibco/Invitrogen) at 37C with 5% C02 in air atmosphere.<br>
Alkaline Phosphatase Assay<br>
[0173] C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in 96 wells with a density of 8xl03 cells/well.<br>
Cells were grown to confluence (72hrs). After sonic Hedgehog (250ng/ml), and/or compound<br>
treatment, the cells were lysed in 110 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4,0.1%<br>
TritonXl00), plates were sonicated and lysates spun through 0.2 µm PVDF plates (Corning).<br>
40 µL of lysates was assayed for AP activity in alkaline buffer solution (Sigma) containing<br>
l mg/ml p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate. After incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, the plates were read<br>
on an Envision plate reader at 405 nm. Total protein was quantified with a BCA protein assay<br>
kit from Pierce according to manufacturer's instructions. AP activity was normalized against<br>
total protein. Note that "A" indicates that the IC50 is less than 20 nM, "B" indicates that the<br>
IC50is 20-100 nM, "C" indicates that the IC50is &gt; 100 nM.<br><br><br>
Examples 29: Pancreatic Cancer Model<br>
[0174]        The activity of Compound 42 was tested in a human pancreatic model:<br>
BXPC-3 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of the right legs of mice. On day<br>
42 post-tumor implant, the mice were randomized into two groups to receive either Vehicle<br>
(30%HPBCD) or Compound 42. Compound 42 was dosed at 40mg/kg/day. After receiving<br>
25 daily doses, Compound 42 statistically reduced tumor volume growth by 40% when<br>
compared to the vehicle control (p=0.0309). At the end of the study, the tumors were<br>
harvested 4 hours post the last dose to evaluate an on target response by q-RT-PCR analysis<br>
of the HH pathway genes. Analysis of human Gli-1 resulted in no modulation. Analysis of<br>
murine Gli-1 mRNA levels resulted in a robust down-regulation in the Compound treated<br>
group, when compared to the Vehicle treated group.<br>
Example 30: Medulloblastoma Model<br>
[0175]        The activity of Compound 42 was also evaluated in a transgenic mouse<br>
model of medulloblastoma. Mice that are heterozygous for loss of function mutations in the<br>
tumor suppressors Patched 1 (Ptchl) and Hypermethylated in Cancer (Hicl) develop<br><br>
spontaneous medulloblastoma. Similar to human medulloblastoma, these tumors demonstrate<br>
complete promoter hypermethylation of the remaining Hicl allele, as well as loss of<br>
expression of the wild type Ptchl allele. When passaged as subcutaneous allografts, these<br>
tumors grow aggressively and are Hedgehog pathway-dependent. This model was employed<br>
to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered Compound, and to correlate activity with drug<br>
exposure in plasma and tumors.   Oral administration (PO) of a single dose of Compound 42<br>
led to dose-dependent down-regulation of the HH pathway in subcutaneously implanted<br>
tumors, as measured by decreased Gli-1 mRNA expression 8 hours post dose administration.<br>
[0176]        Daily (QD) administration of the Compound PO led to a dose dependent<br>
inhibition of tumor growth, with frank tumor regression seen at higher doses. The<br>
approximate effective daily oral dose for 50% inhibition of tumor growth (ED50) is 4mg/kg.<br>
When animals were treated QD for 21 days, long term survival was observed following<br>
cessation of treatment (&gt;60 days), with little to no tumor re-growth.<br>
Example 31: Lung Cancer Model<br>
[0177]        To test the activity of Compound 42 in a human SCLC tumor model,<br>
LX22 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of the right leg. LX22 is primary<br>
xenograft model of SCLC derived from chemo -naive patients, which has been maintained by<br>
mouse to mouse passaging. This tumor responds to etoposide/carboplatin chemotherapy in<br>
way that closely resembles a clinical setting. LX22 regresses during chemotherapy treatment,<br>
goes through a period of remission, and then begins to recur. In the LX22 model, Compound<br>
single agent activity and its ability to modulate the chemoresistant recurrence was tested. On<br>
day 32 post tumor implant, mice were randomized into three dosing groups to receive Vehicle<br>
(30% HBPCD), Compound, or the chemotherapy combination of etoposide and carboplatin<br>
(E/P). Compound 42 was administered at a dose of 40mg/kg/day, and after 16 consecutive<br>
doses mere was no measurable difference between the treated and vehicle groups. Etoposide<br>
was administered i.v at 12mg/kg on days 34, 35, 36, and 48, while Carboplatin was<br>
administered i.v. at 60mg/kg on days 34, 41, and 48, post tumor implant. On day 50, the E/P<br>
treated mice were further randomized to receive either Vehicle (30%HPBCD) or Compound<br>
follow up treatment. The Compound was administered at the oral multi-dose MTD of<br>
40mg/kg/day, and after 35 consecutive doses there was a substantial delay in tumor recurrence<br>
in the treated group, compared to the vehicle group (p=0.0101).<br><br>
