FUJIFILM IMAGING COLORANTS LIMITED (formerly AVECIA INKJET LIMITED) having a principal place of business at Hexagon Tower, Blackley, Manchester, M9 8ZS, United Kingdom<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
459/MUMNP/2004<br><br>

then added to the mixture to lower its pH to ~1. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at this pH. The precipitate obtained was collected by filtration and washed with 2% HCI . The resultant paste was re-dissolved in distilled water (~2 I) at pH 9 to obtain a solution which was desalinated by reverse osmosis. Water was evaporated from this solution to 5 yield 63g of the title compound. The respective ratio of S03H / SO+NH2 / S02N(C2H2)20 was determined to be 1.3 / 1.2 /1.5.<br>
Example 18 (alternative preparation of Example 7)<br><br>
10	To distilled water (320ml) was added tetrahydofurfurylamine (16.7g) followed by<br>
sufficient internal ice to lower temp to ~0°C. Filter cake [380.3 g - prepared as described in Example 17(a) above] was added to the mixture and the pH adjusted to 8.5 to 9.0 using ammonia solution (SG 0.88). The mixture was stirred at this pH and ~0°C for 4 hours and then heated to 40°C and held at pH 8.5 to 9.0 for 30 minutes.   Concentrated HCI was<br>
15 added to the mixture to lower its pH to ~1, and the mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at this pH. The precipitate obtained was then collected by filtration and washed with 2% HCI.. The resultant paste was re-dissolved in distilled water (-21) at pH 9 to obtain a solution which was desalinated by reverse osmosis. Water was evaporated from the solution to yield 71.6g of the title compound.<br>
20<br>
Example 19 (alternative preparation of Example 3)<br><br><br>
SMC 60308<br>
Copper phthalocyanine (117.6g ) was added to chlorosulphonic acid (307ml, 542.9g) over 1-2 hours whilst maintaining the temperature at 
The solid prepared above (389g) was added to water (1 litre) followed by glycine (20.26 g) and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to ~9 by addition of caustic liquor. The mixture was stirred at this pH and heated to 70 to 80°C for ~4 hours. Then 20% w/v salt was added to the mixture and the pH adjusted to 4 by addition of concentrated HCI. The 2 o precipitate obtained was then collected by filtration, washed well with brine and then re-dissolved in distilled water at pH 9 to obtain a solution which was de-salinated by reverse osmosis. Water removed to yield, as solid, 56g of the title compound. The respective ratio of S03H / S02NH2 / S02NHC2H4NHCH2C02H was determined to be 1.3 /1.2 / 1.5<br>
25        Further, alternative preparations<br>
Examples 4 to 5 and 8 to 15 herein can all also be prepared by an analogous route to that described in Example 19 above by replacing the glycine with an equivalent molar amount of the corresponding amine or thiol.<br>
An alternative route to the preparation of Example 1 above would be to remove 3 0        the glycine stated above and heat at pH 10 to 12 and  90°C for 4 hours which results in hydrolysis of the CI substituent to OH.<br>
Results<br>
35        Chroma<br>
Example 1 herein was compared with the known copper phthalocyanine dye Cyan 1 [= CuPc(S03H)(S02NH2)3] in a conventional ink formulation. The chroma of an IJ print made with an ink of Example 1 was found to be 5% higher at a similar optical density than a comparative print made with Cyan 1 (the optical density of a print, can be conveniently<br><br>
SMC 60308<br>
measured using an X-Rite 938 Spectrodensitometer). Chroma values were obtained in a conventional manner.<br>
Dye	Chroma<br>
Example 1	40.5<br>
Cyan 1 (known dye)	38.5<br>
Examples 2, 6 and 7 were also tested for chroma and performed very similarly to 5        Example 1, (i.e. better than Cyan 1).<br>
Water fastness<br>
Dyes of the present invention also demonstrate a desirable combination of solubility and water fastness compared to prior art dye, as illustrated by the following test.<br>
The water fastness of Example 6 herein was compared with the known dye Cyan<br>
1 in the conventional run down test. Water fastness (denoted herein by WF) was<br>
determined by running water (0.5 ml) down lines of print at an angle of approximately<br>
45°C immediately after the lines had been printed. The prints were given a score of 1 to<br>
10 where 1 indicates poor wet fastness and 10 indicates no detected ink run down (i.e.<br>
100% water fast).		'<br>
Dye	WF<br>
Example 6	6<br>
Cyan 1 (known dye)	3<br>
Examples 5, 6, 9 to 15 herein were also tested in the run down test and showed a comparable WF to Example 6 (i.e. better than Cyan 1).<br>
The aqueous solubility of Example 1 was found to be 29%.  This compares to an<br>
aqueous solubility of 14% for its mono-sulphonic acid substituted analogue.<br>
2 0	Thus contrary to what one would expect, the applicant has found that improved<br>
water solubility in the dyes of the present invention (which equates to greater operability in IJP) does not occur at the expense of poor WF.<br>
Prints made with the dyes of the Examples exhibit a WF comparable to or better than the corresponding zero or mono-sulphonic acid dyes.   Dyes of the invention also 25        exhibit  a   particularly  attractive  cyan  shade with  good  chroma  compared  to  their corresponding zero or mono-sulphonic acid analogues.<br>
The dyes of the present invention are significantly easier than prior art dyes to formulate in UP inks and use in UP and yet they produce prints of comparable or improved quality to prior art dyes.<br>
Salts<br>
30<br>
The exemplified sodium salts (examples 1 to 19) prepared as described above, may be used after suitable purification directly in ink formulations as described below or<br><br>
SMC 60308<br>
may be were converted to other IJP-effective salts as follows. Each example was dissolved in distilled water. The solution was filtered and the volume of the filtrate adjusted to 4 litres. The solution was desalinated by reverse osmosis. The dissolved sodium salt may be converted into other salt [e.g. the potassium salt] by passing the 5 solution through an ion-exchange column comprising Dowex HGRW resin saturated with a suitable solution [e.g. potassium hydroxide solution (5% w/v)]. The solution of the (e.g. potassium) salt thus obtained was then filtered and water was evaporated form the filtrate to yield a purified salt suitable for use directly in an ink as described below.<br>
10        Inks<br>
The effectiveness in ink jet printing of compounds of. Formula (1) was demonstrated as follows. Inks separately comprising each exemplified dye were prepared by dissolving 2 parts of the sodium salt, prepared as described above, in 98 parts of a mixture of water and 2-pyrrolidone (in a respective ratio of 90:10 by volume). 15 The inks were printed onto plain paper (obtained from Felix Schoeller) using a thermal ink-jet printer to give a bright cyan prints which had excellent light fastness.<br>
Further inks comprising the exemplified dyes may be may be prepared as described in the following tables in which the number in the first column (headed Ex. no.) denotes the example number of dye to be used in the ink. The dye may be in its free 20 acid form and/or in the form of any IJP-effective salt (e.g. sodium, potassium, ammonium, or QAC salt). Numbers quoted in the second column onwards refer to the number of parts of the relevant ingredient and all parts are by weight. The inks may be applied to paper by thermal or piezo ink jet printing.<br>
