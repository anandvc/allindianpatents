This invention relates to fluid control valves and in particular to pressure regulators or throttling valves including an elastomeric diaphragm element sealing a regulator orifice for flow control.<br>
  Fluid control regulators, such as gas pressure regulators are in common use in gas pipeline systems to assist in maintaining system pressure within acceptable limits.  As an example, the primary function of a gas pressure regulator is to match the flow of gas through the regulator to the demand for gas placed upon the system. Also, the pressure regulator must maintain the system pressure within acceptable limits.<br>
In one type of such gas pressure regulator, a cage is inserted between the regulator fluid input and output ports with a diaphragm assembly being under a spring load to seat against an orifice at the top of the cage.  Unreliable fluid sealing has been noted occasionally in this configuration  particularly at low fluid flow conditions.<br><br>
In some such prior regulators, the diaphragm assembly contains several elements of complicated structure leading to a larger than desired regulator package which also is expensive to manufacture.  In other such prior regulators, the diaphragm assembly has been reduced to a minimum of components utilizing a flat plate across the top of the cage and over the orifice opening.  However, in such prior regulators the orifice is not substantially open and the flow path is obstructed even when the diaphragm is in the fully opened position above the orifice, thus reducing the regulated flow through the regulator. This undesired configuration leads to lower regulator flow capacity than desired.<br>
It is desired therefore to provide a fluid control regulator having a diaphragm assembly which accommodates a high flow capacity in a small regulator package, and contains few components so as to reduce manufacturing and assembling costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A fluid control regulator including a valve body having a fluid input and a fluid output and a flow passageway therebetween.  A cage element is inserted within the flow passageway and is adapted to permit flow through the cage and a top orifice between the regulator fluid input and output.  A diaphragm assembly<br><br>
is movably mounted above the cage orifice to regulate fluid passing between the regulator input and output.<br>
The diaphragm assembly includes an elastomeric diaphragm ring element circular in shape and having a flat central portion bounded by a formed convolution which in one embodiment is provided by a ridged annular diaphragm portion being joined together by a concave perimeter.  In another embodiment the formed convolution is provided by a raised annular ridge in the diaphragm joining together the flat central portion and a flat mounting perimeter.  The elastomeric diaphragm element is formed of a nitrile type material or other such elastomeric material.<br>
In the regulator closed position the flat central portion of the diaphragm extends across the cage top to close the regulator orifice and prevent the flow of fluid through the passageway and through the regulator input and output.  In response to regulator operation requiring the opening of the orifice, the elastomeric diaphragm element is flexibly moved away from the cage top with the concave perimeter switching to a convex perimeter, or the raised ridge portion straightening out in the second embodiment, and, in both cases, enabling the regulator orifice to be fully opened.  Providing a full opening of the orifice allows the regulator to handle a high capacity of fluid<br><br>
pressure as compared to prior regulator devices of this type.<br>
A diaphragm mounting ring includes an exterior surface matching the annular ridged portion of the diaphragm ring in the seated position.  On the opposite side of the diaphragm, the regulator bonnet includes a diaphragm mounting flange having an interior surface which is contoured to match the diaphragm ring when the ring is flexed to the fully open position and the diaphragm concave perimeter has been switched to a convex perimeter, or the raised annular ridge straightens out.<br>
The improved diaphragm assembly of the present invention is supported at its center with a diaphragm head on one side and a flat diaphragm plate on the other side to provide a seat load through a conventional plug/spring load configuration in for instance an unloading regulator.  The diaphragm head also serves as a flow deflector to prevent diaphragm erosion and to increase capacity.  As an alternative, the center diaphragm support can be drilled to provide a balancing port for a loading/actuated style regulator to provide a balanced plug curtain style valve. Therefore, the pressure regulator with an elastomeric diaphragm assembly of the present invention enables the production of a high capacity, small package, in-line<br><br>
maintenance regulator valve that is adaptable for both loading and unloading actuation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a fluid control valve, such as a throttling valve, includes a valve body having a fluid inlet, a fluid outlet, and a fluid passageway therebetween.  A cage member includes a cage interior receiving fluid at one cage end and a cap at the other cage end having cap openings in fluid communication with the cage interior. The cage member is mounted within the valve body fluid passageway for passing fluid from the valve body fluid inlet through the cage interior, and continuing through the cap openings to exit from the valve body fluid outlet.  A flexible diaphragm is mounted in the valve body and flexibly movable from adjacent the cap openings to move away from the cap openings in controlling the flow of fluid between the valve body fluid inlet and the fluid outlet.  Flow diverter means within the cage interior reduce the separation of the fluid flow which is passing between the cage top end and the cap openings so as to reduce the required flow recovery area as the fluid flow exits the top cage end and then enters the cap openings on the way to the valve body fluid outlet.<br>
In one embodiment, the flow diverter means is provided by a decreasing cage interior volume as viewed by the fluid flow progressing from the cage inlet at<br><br>
the bottom of the cage to the cage outlet, and followed by a substantially constant cage interior volume as the flow continues to exit the top of the cage.  This decreasing cage interior volume followed by a substantially constant cage interior volume portion tends to make the fluid flow curve around the top of the cage with a minimum of flow separation so as to reduce the amount of flow recovery area normally required prior to the fluid entering the cap openings. In another embodiment, a flow diverter is provided by a decreasing cage interior volume portion as the fluid flow progresses from the bottom of the cage towards the top of the cage, followed by a ledge projecting into the cage interior and with the projection continuing to the top cage end, either as a sharp ledge or as a more rounded ledge.  In either event, this alternative flow diverter reduces the fluid flow separation as the fluid passes out the top cage end and goes towards and finally enters the cap openings.  The ledge can also include a substantially constant cage interior volume in continuing to the top of the cage.<br>
A raised seat is provided on the cage cap and is situated between the cage top end where the fluid flow exits the cage and the cap openings.  Preferably, the raised seat is located at a position of low turbulence and of low velocity, in a stagnant flow region.  This enables the sealing of the raised seat by<br><br>
the diaphragm to be more reliable under all flow conditions, including low flow conditions which caused fluid sealing reliability problems in prior regulator valves. In addition, because of the flow diverter means reducing flow separation around the throttling area, the seat can be efficiently located so as to avoid the loss of regulator flow capacity which was required in prior devices.  Furthermore, the flow diverter means enables the location of a desired sharp raised seat or knife edge seat in an area on the cage cap so as to significantly reduce the build-up of contaminants on the seat.<br>
A retaining ring engages the cap for mounting the cage in the valve body.  The retaining ring can be a hollow ring enabling full fluid flow therethrough, or can include flow blocking fingers in the ring interior which fingers can mate with the cap openings to desirably reduce the flow capacity of the regulator. In this manner, one cage can be used with any number of capacity alternatives by simply changing the retainer ring to a respective ring having none or a varying plurality of flow blocking fingers.  Alternatively, the retaining ring could be incorporated with the cage in a single casting.<br>
A center diaphragm support is mounted to the diaphragm central portion and includes a lower diaphragm plug-like head and an upper flat diaphragm<br><br>
plate with the diaphragm central portion sandwiched therebetween.  Aspirator passageways extend through the center diaphragm support for communicating the loading chamber on one side of the diaphragm to the other diaphragm side.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the afore¬mentioned regulator valve may include a noise attenuation device.  The noise attenuation device is provided by a perforated member surrounding the cage and intermediate the fluid flow progressing from the cap openings to the valve body outlet so as to attenuate noise in the fluid flow.  One or more of such perforated members can be mounted into position surrounding the cage to provide flow diffusion so as to reduce noise generated by turbulence, depending upon the level of attenuation desired.<br>
A valve stem is engageably coupled to the center of the diaphragm so as to move the diaphragm towards and away from the cap openings, and passageways in the valve body accommodate and guide the valve stem during such movement.  This guided valve stem configuration permits stabilizing of the diaphragm. Alternatively, instead of stem guiding, the diaphragm assembly can include a skirt portion movably guided within the valve body.  A travel indicator having a scale also may be mounted to the valve body to cooperate with a marker on the valve stem to indicate<br><br>
the valve stem position and therefore the opening position of the valve.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the valve stem actuated diaphragm is attached to a conventional valve actuator wherein the moving forces are supplied through a loading pilot.  Such a valve actuator and regulator combination in accordance with this invention can be reliably used for low differential pressure applications.  In a self-operated version of the actuator/regulator combination, instead of the moving force supplied through a loading pilot, the controlled pressure can be obtained from the down¬stream pressure.<br>
The present invention solves many of the prior problems encountered in prior regulators using an elastomeric diaphragm and throttling cage element.  In addition, the present invention provides many significant advantages, including the following:<br>
