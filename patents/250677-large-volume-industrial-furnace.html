				<td>Refractory wall and refractory bricks for building said wall<br><br>
5	The invention relates to refractory masonry and<br>
	refractory bricks for producing the refractory lining<br>
	of large-volume industrial furnaces in which mineral<br>
	products such as cement, lime, magnesite, dolomite or<br>
	the like are fired under an essentially oxidizing<br>
10	atmosphere at temperatures above 700oC, in particular<br>
	above 900°C.<br>
	In industry, cement, line, magnesite and dolomite are<br>
	mainly fired in rotary tube furnaces or shaft kilns.<br>
15	The firing process is essentially carried out under<br>
	oxidizing conditions.<br>
	The operating life of the furnaces depends, inter alia,<br>
	on the type of refractory masonry lining which,<br>
20	firstly, protects the metal outer wall of the furnace<br>
	from the high temperatures of the material being fired,<br>
	flame temperatures and atmospheric temperatures and,<br>
	secondly, reduces heat losses. In addition, the<br>
	refractory lining can act as a heat exchanger which<br>
25	takes up the heat energy from the hot furnace gases and<br>
	passes it to the material being fired.<br>
	The masonry lining of the furnace is usually subjected<br>
	to high temperature-change stresses and high mechanical<br>
30	and chemical stresses- The temperature-change stresses<br>
	result from the higher temperature of the furnace gases<br>
	compared to the temperature of the material being<br>
	fired. Mechanical stresses are caused by rotary motion<br>
	of the furnace and by movement of the material being<br>
35	fired. The masonry is subjected to chemical stresses by<br><br><br>
- 1a -<br>
	constituents of the material being fired and by<br>
	volatile compounds in the furnace atmosphere which<br>
	deposit in the refractory lining as a result of<br>
	temperature gradients.<br><br>
— 2 —<br>
	These furnaces which are operated under oxidizing<br>
	conditions, e.g. rotary furnaces for cement and lime,<br>
	furnaces for dolomite and magnesite and shaft kilns,<br>
	are lined with fired refractory bricks, in the basic<br>
5	region essentially with refractory bricks based .on Mgo,<br>
	e.g. with magnesia spinel bricks, magnesia chromite<br>
	bricks, magnesia hercynite bricks as magnesia spinel<br>
	mineral bricks, magnesia zirconia bricks, dolomite<br>
	bricks ox the like and in the nonbasic region with<br>
10	chamotte bricks, andalusite bricks, bauxite bricks or<br>
	the like.<br>
	The lining is occasionally also constructed using<br>
	unfired phosphorus- or phosphate-bonded lightweight<br>
15	refractory bricks in some zones.<br>
	For the purposes of constructing the masonry, the<br>
	furnaces are divided into various zones because<br>
	different stresses occur in the zones during operation.<br>
20	In the case of a rotary tube furnace for cement, the<br>
	furnace is divided, going from the feed end for the<br>
	material being fired to the outlet end for the material<br>
	being fired, into, for example, a preheating zone, a<br>
	safety zone, an upper transition zone, a sintering<br>
25	zone, a lower transition zone and an outlet zone. A<br>
	stable accumulation of material being fired is<br>
	generally formed in the sintering zone, and this can<br>
	protect the sintering zone. Detachment of material from<br>
	this accumulation can cause damage, as can cement<br>
30	clinker phase infiltration in the event of overheating.<br>
	If the accumulation is absent or unstable, the<br>
	transition zones are subjected to alkali Infiltration,<br>
	thermal influences and redon influences and also<br>
	temperature changes. In addition, thermomechanical<br>
35	stresses occur, for example, as a result of ovality<br>
	stresses and curvature of the furnace axis. Secondary<br>
	fuels, e.g. automobile tires, also produce additional<br>
	uncontrollable stresses.<br><br>
- 2a -<br>
	The preheating, safety and outlet zones are generally<br>
	lined with bricks which are rich in chamotte and<br>
	alumina, while the other zones are generally lined with<br>
	bricks based on magnesia (MgO) or dolomite (MgO/OaO).<br>
5<br>
	Shaft kilns are generally divided similarly.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	When operating conditions are uniform, the known<br>
	furnace linings provide the prescribed properties and<br>
	protect against premature attrition. However, uniform<br>
	operating conditions can often not be achieved. Changes<br>
5	in furnace operating parameters or materials<br>
	parameters, e.g. in respect of clinker moduli in the<br>
	firing of cement or necessary repair of previous damage<br>
	is not carried out in good time, frequently occur<br>
	within a relatively short time. Changing chemical<br>
10	attacks and changing thermal and thermomechanical<br>
	stresses lead to accelerated attrition and to damage.<br>
	Attempts have been made in the past to counter this<br>
	problem by improving the materials composition of the<br>
15	fired bricks and thus to match them to unfavorable<br>
	operating conditions. This application-oriented<br>
	optimization comprises essentially changing the<br>
	chemical-mineralogical composition of the bricks with<br>
	the aim of, for example, increasing their elastic<br>
20	properties and corrosion resistance. An example is<br>
	provided by magnesia spinel bricks which generally<br>
	ensure a higher elasticity than magnesia chromite<br>
	bricks. In addition, the magnesia chromite bricks are<br>
	subject to higher corrosion due to attack by cement<br>
25	clinker phases. This is countered by means of magnesia<br>
	zirconia bricks which are less stress-sensitive.<br>
	Accordingly, these bricks have been developed further<br>
	and special bricks designed for the respective stress<br>
	case have been produced. However, since the stress<br>
30	cases are varied, this development leads to a dead end<br>
	and is very costly.<br>
	It is an object of the invention to provide refractory<br>
	masonry for furnaces operated using an oxidizing<br>
35	furnace atmosphere, which survives stress changes<br>
	significantly better and whose refractory brick<br>
	material is optimally matched to the normal stresses<br>
	and not to the stress changes.<br><br><br>
- 3a -<br>
	This object is achieved by the features of claim 1,<br>
	Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined<br>
	in the subordinate claims.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	According to the invention, unfired refractory bricks<br>
	composed of customarily used material, e.g. one of the<br>
	abovementioned refractory materials, which have<br>
	customarily used three-dimensional shapes and are<br>
5	phosphorus-bonded or whose binder is a synthetic resin,<br>
	tar or pitch or are bonded by means of another suitable<br>
	material are employed.<br>
	It is important that carbon, particular graphite, is<br>
10	present in the brick material, in particular in the<br>
	pores, on the side of the masons or the bricks facing<br>
	the interior of the furnace. The graphite can be a<br>
	natural or synthetic graphite, e.g. floe graphite. It<br>
	has been found that the graphite together with the<br>
15	material being fired and/or the oxidizing atmosphere in<br>
	all zones obviously produces a type of sealing of the<br>
	surface of the unfired bricks which not only does not<br>
	disturb the desired optimised properties in respect of<br>
	the different stresses in the zones but also ensures<br>
20	the prescribed properties in the case of stress<br>
	changes. The graphite is particularly effective in<br>
	combination with a carbon-containing binder material<br>
	such as synthetic resin, tar or pitch, with the action<br>
	being particularly good when synthetic resin is<br>
25	present. Synthetic resins are used, in particular<br>
	phenolic resins (phenol resol) or phenolic resin-<br>
	novalak solutions.<br>
	It is advantageous to provide a graphite-containing<br>
30	zone of from about 1 to 18 cm, preferably from 2 to<br>
	15 cm, which makes the graphite available for the<br>
	oxidizing surface reaction with the material being<br>
	fired and/or the furnace atmosphere, and may<br>
	additionally provide a reserve stock of graphite and,<br>
35	if appropriate, carbon-containing binders in the<br>
	interior of the brick. The sealing zone obviously<br>
	protects the furnace-side (hot-side) surface region of<br>
	the bricks so that not all of the graphite from the<br>
	graphite-containing zone is consumed and is available<br><br>
- 4a -<br>
	for further sealing in the event of damage to the<br>
	surface.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
	The porosity in the graphite-containing zone, but<br>
	preferably also in the entire unfired brick, is<br>
	advantageously less than 30% by volume, preferably less<br>
	than 14% by volume, in particular, the porosity is in<br>
5	the range from 1 to 8% by volume.<br>
	The graphite content of the graphite-containing zone is<br>
	preferably from 2 to 30% by weight, in particular from<br>
	S to 20* by weight. In the case of carbon-containing<br>
10	binders, the carbon content of binder plus grapftite<br>
	should be within the indicated limits of from 2 to 30%<br>
	by weight, in particular from 5 to 20% by weight. The<br>
	carbon-containing binder is preferably used in amounts<br>
	of from 2 to 5% by weight, in particular from 2-5 to 4%<br>
15	by weight.<br>
	In a particular embodiment of the invention, the<br>
	graphite-containing zone . further comprises<br>
	antioxidants, for example AL, si, mg, sic, Si3N4, B4C or <br>
20	metallic alloys. The antioxidants surprisingly do not<br>
	adversely affect the formation of the soaling zone on<br>
	the surface, but prevent excessively deep penetration<br>
	of the oxidation into the graphite-containing zone, so <br>
	that carbon, reserves remain for future reformation of<br>
25	damage to sealing regions.<br>
	The use of bricks which are completely graphite-<br>
	containing or graphite-containing in their entirety or<br>
	throughout is encompassed by the scope of the<br>
30	invention. It is likewise within the scope of the<br>
	invention, in particular, to use bricks which are<br>
	completely graphite-containing and are bonded by<br>
	carbon-containing binders such as synthetic resin, tar<br>
	or pitch. In this respect, the invention provides for<br>
35	the use of basic, carbon-containing refractory bricks<br>
	known per se which have been designed for use in a<br>
	reducing a-atmosphere, e.g. for use in steel production,<br>
	for the masonry of furnaces operated under oxidizing<br>
	conditions. Such basic refractory bricks are used, for<br><br>
- 5a -<br>
	example, for lining metallurgical vessels such as<br>
	converters, steel pouring ladles or electric are-<br>
	furnaces. These likewise unfired carbon-containing<br>
	bricks, in particular magnesia bricks or dolomite<br><br><br>
- 6 -<br>
	bricks, ensure compatibility with most basic slags and<br>
	the stability of the carbon, in particular the graphite<br>
	too, in the reducing atmosphere which prevails in steel<br>
	production. The bricks are bonded by means of synthetic<br>
5	resin, pitch or tar and are shaped in the cold state<br>
	(phenolic resin-bonded or phenolic resin-novalak-bonded<br>
	bricks) or in the hot state (phenolic resin-novalak It-<br>
	bonded or tar- or pitch-bonded bricks) . In addition,<br>
	the bricks generally further comprise antioxidants<br>
10	which, owing to their higher affinity for oxygen<br>
	compared to carbon, reduce burning away of the carbon.<br>
	The action of the antioxidants is based mainly on their<br>
	making entry of gas more difficult and on an increase<br>
	in the strength- Materials typically used are metals,<br>
15	carbides or nitrides, for example Al, Mg, Si, Sic, B4C,<br>
	si3N4, A1N, BN or else SiAlON.<br>
	Within the scope of the invention, use is made of the<br>
	known technology for the production of such carbon-<br>
20	containing bricks by producing bricks used according to<br>
	the invention by means of the appropriate technology.<br>
	The sealing zone according to the invention prevents,<br>
	in particular in combination with a low porosity of the<br>
25	unfired brick material, infiltration of volatile<br>
	components from the furnace atmosphere, e.g. alkali<br>
	metal compounds, chlorine compounds and sulfur<br>
	compounds, which could damage or destroy the masonry.<br>
30	Furthermore, a high measure of thermochemical<br>
	resistance to attack by, for example, cement clinker<br>
	phases is ensured by the sealing zone according to the<br>
	invention and, in particular, also by a low porosity.<br>
35	In addition, the graphite content effects, in<br><br>
- 6a -<br>
	particular in combination with carbon-containing<br>
	binders, a desirably low modulus of elasticity E and<br>
	correspondingly a desirably low shear modulus G.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	In the case of the raw material components MgO and<br>
	carbon, the graphite-containing zones or the bricks are<br>
	very thermally stable, Even a paxtial or complete-<br>
	replacement of the HgO by other refractory materials<br>
5	such as spinels, a-alumina, bauxite, andalusite,<br>
	mullite, flint clay or chamotte does not impair the<br>
	sealing action.<br>
	The oxidizing atmosphere surprisingly produces only a<br>
10	minimal burning out of carbon on the hot side of the<br>
	masonry, with the resulting ashing likewise<br>
	surprisingly leading to a type of sealing zone on the<br>
	surface of the brick, probably due to sintering<br>
	processes at the brick surface, without other materials<br>
15	properties of the bricks being lost, In the sintering<br>
	zone and possibly also in the transition zones, the<br>
	desired deposits are formed more quickly and are acre<br>
	durable. Detached material is relatively rare even in<br>
	the case of overheating and stress changes.<br>
20<br>
	According to the invention, bricks which can withstand<br>
	the attack of the hot cement clinker phases, e.g.<br>
	bricks based on MgO and graphite, are used for the hot<br>
	furnace zones such as the sintering and transition<br>
25	zones, e.g. of rotary tube furnaces or shaft kilns.<br>
	These advantageously comprise the abovementioned<br>
	antioxidants which control the burning away of the<br>
	carbon. In addition, the antioxidants increase the<br>
	strength of the brick on the use side. The bricks can<br>
30	comprise not only magnesia (sintered magnesia or fused<br>
	magnesia) but also spinel, bauxite or a-alumina, or<br>
	magnesia can be replaced completely by these minerals,<br>
	especially where the thermal conductivity is to be<br>
	reduced.<br>
35<br>
	The bricks of the invention are used not only for the<br>
	hot zones of rotary tube furnaces and shaft kilns, but<br>
	advantageously also for all other zones. For example,<br>
	the safety zone is provided with carbon-containing<br><br><br>
- 7a -<br>
	bricks which comprise, as alumina-containing<br>
	constituent, andalusite or another mineral of the<br>
	sillimanite group, bauxite or an alumina-rich special<br>
	chambtta- The carbon content of the bricks should<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	in this case, too, be in the range from 2 to 30% by<br>
	weight. These bricks, too, can further comprise<br>
	antioxidants for the indicated purpose.<br>
5	The invention also provides for use of carbon-<br>
	containing chamotte bricks which are preferably<br>
	likewise resin-, tar- or pitch-bonded like the other<br>
	bricks for the preheating zone of the furnaces which<br>
	have hitherto usually been, lined with chamotte bricks.<br>
10	However, these carbon-containing bricks can also be<br>
	bonded by means of other organic or inorganic materials<br>
	and can further comprise antioxidants for the<br>
	abovementioned purpose.<br>
15	The furnace outlet, which has hitherto been lined with<br>
	fired bauxite bricks, is, according to the invention,<br>
	preferably lined with carbon-containing alumina-rich<br>
	bricks, for example bauxite bricks or with carbon-<br>
	containing magnesia bricks, which comprise<br>
20	antioxidants, in particular to ensure a higher strength<br>
	because of the abrasive stresses occurring in the<br>
	furnace outlet.<br>
	Should the temperatures on the outside of the firing<br>
25	apparatus, vis. the outer wall of the furnace, become<br>
	too high during use, it is possible to line the furnace<br>
	with a two-layer masonry lining. This masonry comprises<br>
	the carbon-containing bricks described, which comprise<br>
	refractory minerals, graphite and, if appropriate,<br>
30	antioxidants, on the hot side and insulating masonry<br>
	comprising, for example, a commercial chamotte brick or<br>
	another thermally insulating material, for example a<br>
	lightweight chamotte brick, on the side facing the<br>
	outer wall of the furnace.<br>
35<br>
	Bricks according to the invention comprise graphite in<br>
	the hot zone. The cold side of the brick can comprise,<br>
	for example, the same material without graphite or a<br>
	thermally insulating material. Fig. 1 shows such a<br><br>
- 8a -<br>
	structure, with the two-layer brick 1 consisting of the<br>
	graphite-containing zone 2 on the hot side and the<br>
	insulating zone 3 on the cold side. These bricks can be<br>
	produced in one process and have a durable bond between<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	the two zones. Of course, it is also possible for the<br>
	insulating part and the carbon-containing part to be<br>
	manufactured separately and be adhesively bonded<br>
	together by means of an adhesive to aid installation,<br>
5<br>
	Fig. 2 schematically shows an example of the lining of<br>
	a rotary tube furnace for cement. Here, the preheating<br>
	zone is lined with carbon-containing chamotte bricks,<br>
	the safety zone is lined with carbon-containing<br>
10	alumina-rich bricks and/or carbon-containing bauxite-<br>
	bricks, the upper transition zone is lined with carbon-<br>
	containing magnesia bricks and/or carbon-containing<br>
	magnesia spinel bricks, the sintering zone is lined<br>
	with carbon-containing magnesia bricks and/or carbon-<br>
15	containing magnesia spinel bricks and the lower<br>
	transition zone is lined with carbon-containing<br>
	magnesia bricks and/or carbon-containing magnesia<br>
	spinel bricks. Fig. 2 shows the rotary tube 4, the<br>
	firing flame 5 and the burner 6.<br>
20<br>
	The invention is illustrated below with the aid of the<br>
	following examples of a refractory masonry lining.<br>
	Example I: Rotary tube furnace<br>
25<br>
	A rotary tube furnace for cement in which a portland<br>
	cement clinker is fired under typical operating<br>
	conditions is used as a starting point. The length of<br>
	the furnace is 75 m, and the diameter is 4,50 m. The<br>
30	division into zones as shown in fig. 2 is as follows:<br>
	Outlet zone			FP		0 - 5 m<br>
	lower transition zone		FP		5 - 12 m<br>
	Sintering sorts			FP		12 - 30 m<br>
35	Upper transition zone		FP		30 - 43 m<br>
	Safety zone			FP		43 - S2 m<br>
	Preheating zone		FP		52 - 75 m<br>
					FP = point in the rum&amp;ce (in<br>
					cumulative meters)<br><br>
- 9a -<br>
	A lining according to the invention is provided as<br>
	follows:<br><br>
-10 –<br>
	Outlet zone				FP		0-5 m<br>
	Lining is effected by means of a magnesia brick having<br>
	a graphite content of 10% by weight; the composition of<br>
5	this brick is as follows:<br>
	Sintered magnesia grain 0-4 mm 		71% by weight<br>
	Sintered magnesia flour 
	Floc graphite			10% by weight<br>
10	Aluminum powder				3% by weight<br>
	Silicon power					3% by weight<br>
	The binder is a phenolic resol which is addsd in an<br>
	amount of 3.2% by weight to the dry mix. The brick is<br>
15	pressed in the customary formats for the cement<br>
	industry (known as VD2 formats) at a pressing pressure<br>
	of 160 MPa and subsequently heated at a temperature of<br>
	200oC.<br>
