The urethane resin used as a film for providing the coated granular material of the present invention is a urethane resin obtained by reaction of an aromatic polyisocyanate with an alcohol mixture comprising a polyesterpolyol and a C4'C30 alkanol optionally substituted by one or more aryl groups. The polyesterpolyol has 15 wt% or more of an oxycarbonyl structure (■0-C(=0)-) part in the molecule. The molar ratio of the polyesterpolyol to the alkanol is 1^1 to 100^1.<br>
Preferable polyesterpolyol is polylactonepolyol, which means a compound produced by ring-opening-polymerizing a lactone monomer with a low molecular weight polyol. Examples of the lactone monomer include /9 •propiolactone, y -butyrolactone, 6 -valerolactone and i 'caprolactone. Examples of the low molecular weight polyol include divalent alcohol such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,8-octanediol; and trivalent alcohol such as 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol (trimethylolpropane), 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, glycerin and triethanolamine.<br>
Preferable polyesterpolyol is polycaprolactonepolyol, which is a compound produced by ring-opening-polymerizing an e-caprolactone monomer with the above-mentioned low molecular weight polyol. Typical chemical structures of the polycaprolactonepolyol (polycaprolactbnediol or polycaprolactonetriol) having two or three hydroxyl groups in one molecule are shown below. This polycaprolactonepolyol is a polyol having at least one (l-oxohexa-l,6-diyl)oxy structure (-C(=0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH8-CH2-0-) in one molecule.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
[wherein, m represents an integer of 0 or more, n represents an integer of 1 or more and m+n is 2 or more, and R' represents a divalent organic group (for example, ethylene group, tetramethylene group and the like)].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
O—H<br>
H—O'<br>
<br>
[wherein, m and p represent an integer of 0 or more, n represents an integer of 1 or more and m+n+p is 2 or more, and R2 represents a trivalent organic group (for example, propane-l,2,3-triyl group and the like)].<br>
For       example,       a       polycaprolactonepolyol       produced       by ring-opening-polymerizing 6 moles of   £ -caprolactone with one mole of 10     ethylene glycol has the following formula^<br>
H0-[CH2 'CH2 •CH2 -CHz -CHa -C(=0)-0]8 -CHz •CH2 •[0C(=0)-CH2 -CH2 "C H2-CH2-CH2]3-OH<br>
The  polycaprolactonepolyol  has  about  35 wt%  of an  oxycarbonyl<br>
structure (•0-C(=0)-) part in the molecule, namely,<br>
	(44x6)/(62+114X6) = 0.354<br>
wherein, each molecular weight of £ -caprolactone and ethylene glycol is 114 and 62, respectively, and the oxycarbonyl structure has 44 of the molecular weight.<br>
Further,   the   equivalent   weight   of  the   hydroxyl   group   to   the 20     polycaprolactonepolyol is 373, namely, (62+114x6)/2=373 wherein, the molecular weight of the   i -caprolactone is divided by the number of the hydroxyl group.<br>
The molecular weight of the polycaprolactonepolyol is preferably 300 to<br>
 <br>
5000, more preferably 400 to 2500.   Further, the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl group to the polycaprolactonepolyol is usually 200 to 1250.<br>
Another typical polyesterpolyol is a polyesterpolyol obtained by condensing polymerization of a diol with a dicarboxylic acid. Examples of the diol include ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol, and examples of the dicarboxylic acid include succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, decanedicarboxylic acid and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid.<br>
The amount of the polyesterpolyol is usually 10 to 90 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 80 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the aromatic polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture. The C4-C30 alkanol optionally substituted by one or more aryl groups include a C4-C30 alkanol, an alkanol substituted by one or more aryl groups (e.g., phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, methylnaphthyl) having 4 to 30 of the total carbon number, and a mixture thereof. Among them, a C4-C18 n-alkan-1-ol is preferable. Further, 1-butanol, l-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-dodecanol, 2-octyl-l-dodecanol, benzyl alcohol and a mixture thereof are also preferable. The amount of the C4-C30 alkanol optionally substituted by one or more aryl groups is usually 1 to 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the aromatic polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture. The amount of the alkanol is usually set for making the equivalent ratio of the OH group in the alkanol to NCO group in the aromatic polyisocyanate 1:0.01-1:0.4.<br>
Examples of the aromatic polyisocyanate include 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), tolylene diispcyanate (TDI), xylylene diisocyanate (XDI), tolidine diisocyanate (TODI), naphthalene l,5-dii8ocyanate (NDI), tetramethylenexylylene  diisocyanate  (TMXDI), polymethylenepolyphenyl<br>
 <br>
polyisocyanate (polymeric MDI) and derivatives thereof (e.g., modified substances such as isocyanurate, biuret and urethodione). Among them, MDI, TODI and polymeric MDI are preferable. The amount of the aromatic polyisocyanate is usually 5 to 45 parts by weight based on 100 parts by 5 weight of the total amount of the aromatic polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture.<br>
In the present invention, the molar ratio of the isocyanate (NCO) group in the aromatic polyisocyanate to the hydroxyl (OH) group in the polyol mixture is generally 1:0.9 • i:i.5, preferably i:i • i:i.2.<br>
	The  urethane resin is produced usually by reacting the  aromatic<br>
polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture, if necessary in the presence of a catalyst, on the surface of a bioactive substance-containing granule or on a coat film covering a bioactive substance'containing granule.<br>
The reaction of the aromatic polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture is<br>
 not particularly restricted, and can be carried out by, for example, a method in which all aromatic polyisocyanates and alcohol mixture are mixed and hardened. Further, it is also possible that a small amount of organic solvent is mixed with a polyisocyanate and alcohol mixture, and a solvent is removed simultaneously with the reaction.   The reaction conditions thereof<br>
 can be selected arbitrarily, however, when the temperature is raised, the reaction speed of a hydroxyl group and an isocyanate group increases. By adding a catalyst, the reaction speed can be accelerated.<br>
Examples of the catalyst to be used for production of a urethane resin include organometal compounds such as potassium acetate, calcium acetate,<br>
 stannous octoate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dichloride, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutinthiostannic acid, stannous octylate, di-n-octyltin dilaurate, isopropyl    titanate,    bismuth    2-ethyl    hexanoate,    phosphine,    zinc<br>
 <br>
neodecanoate, tetrabutyl titanate, oxyisopropyl vanadate, n-propyl<br>
zirconate and the like, and amine catalysts such as triethylamine,<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine,	triethylenediamine,<br>
N-methylmorpholine, N.N-dimethyldidodecylamine, N-dodecylmorpholine, 5     N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-ethylmorpholine, dimethylethanolamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, 2,4,6-tri8(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol and the like.<br>
A mixture having flowability of an aromatic polyisocyanate and alcohol mixture  (further,  catalyst to be  added if necessary),  before  sufficient<br>
 reaction of the aromatic polyisocyanate and the hydroxyl group in the alcohol mixture, is expressed as an unhardened urethane resin in some cases.<br>
The coated granule of the present invention is a coated granule obtained  by  coating a bioactive  substance-containing  granule  with  a<br>
15 urethane resin, and the coat using a urethane resin suppresses elution of a bioactive substance in the bioactive substance'containing granule. In the present invention, mentioned as the bioactive substance contained in the bioactive substance-containing granule are insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulating agents, repellents, fertilizers and the<br>
20     like.<br>

The coated granule of the present invention can be produced by forming a coat made of the above-mentioned urethane resin around a bioactive substance-containing granule, and the coating method is not particularly<br>
5 restricted. There are mentioned, for example, (l) a method in which a solution or emulsion of a urethane resin prepared separately is sprayed around a bioactive substance-containing granule, then, a solvent is removed to attain coating; (2) a method in which an aromatic polyisocyanate and an alcohol mixture are added simultaneously or subsequently to a bioactive<br>
0 substance-containing granule, and on the surface of the bioactive substance-containing granule, a urethane resin is prepared to attain coating; and other methods.<br>
The reaction temperature of the aromatic polyisocyanate with the alcohol mixture is usually 20 to 200*^, preferably 50 to ISO'C.<br>
5	Desired elution suppressing ability can be obtained even if the use<br>
amount of a resin used for coating is smaller providing a coat film in the coated granule of the present invention is uniform.   Thus, it is preferable<br>
 <br>
18<br>
that the urethane resin is produced by reacting the aromatic polyisocyanate and the alcohol mixture under the condition without solvent on the surface of a granular material containing a bioactive substance.<br>
Examples of the coated granule of the present invention used for<br>
5 applications in the agricultural field include coated granular fertilizers, coated pesticidal granules, solid pesticidal microcapsules, solid pesticidal microspheres and the like.<br>
In obtaining the coated granule of the present invention, coating can be performed without using a solvent in resin molding, if an unhardened<br>
0 urethano rosin has suitable flowability for a suitable period at temperatures in producing a urethane resin.<br>
In the coated granule of the present invention, it is preferable that a urethane resin has a hydrophobic liquid compound having a boiling point of lOCC  or  higher  from  the  standpoint  of bioactive   substance   elution<br>
5 suppressing ability. The hydrophobic liquid compound is usually immersed in a urethane resin or supported on its surface. The hydrophobic liquid compound is liquid at 20°C, and examples thereof include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hquid paraffin, aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenylxylylethane, distyrylxylene, alkylbenzene (Splvesso 150; trade name<br>
0 of Exxon-Mobile Chemical), fatty acid ester compounds such as vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil, cottonseed oil).<br>
In the coated granule of the present invention, it is preferable that the above-mentioned hydrophobic liquid compound is contained in an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt% in the core granule material of the present invention, and in<br>
5 general, it is preferable that the hydrophobic liquid compound is added in an amount to an extent of slight presence of the hydrophobic liquid compound on the surface of the core granule.<br>
 <br>
19<br>
The method for producing a coated granule of the present invention will be illustrated in more detail referring to a method for producing a coated granular fertilizer as an example.<br>
Particles of a granular fertilizer are made into fluidizing condition or<br>
6 tumbling condition in an apparatus such as a jet flow apparatus, rolling pan, rolling drum and the like. The size of the particle is not particularly restricted, and usually 0.1 to 15 mm, and its shape is preferably sphere, and may also be other configuration such as cylinder and the like. The particles under fluidizing or tumbling condition are, if necessary, heated.    Next, an<br>
0 unhardened urethane resin containing an aromatic polyisocyanate, an alcohol mixture and, a catalyst to be added if necessary, is added to the particle under fluidizing or tumbling condition. The addition method may be either a method of mixing components before quick addition, or a method of adding components  separately.     Thereafter,  while  maintaining the<br>
5	fluidizing or tumbling condition of the particles, the reaction of an<br>
isocyanate group in the aromatic polyisocyanate and a hydroxyl group in the<br>
alcohol mixture is progressed, thereby, the surface of the particle is coated<br>
with a urethane resin. It is preferable to control the amount of the<br>
urethane resin to be added so that the thickness of a coat film formed in this<br>
0 one operation is usually 1 to 20iim. Further, when larger thickness of a coat film is necessary, the thickness of a urethane resin coat film can be increased by repeating the above-mentioned operation.<br>
In the coated granule of the present invention, the thickness of an urethane resin coat film is usually 1 to lOOOiim, preferably 8 to 400iim, and<br>
6	the amount thereof is usually 1 to 20 wt% (based on coated granular<br>
material of the present invention), preferably 3 to 16 wt%.<br>
The particle size of the coated granule of the present invention is<br>
 <br>
20<br>
usually in the range of 0.1 to 15 mm.<br>
When a urethane resin has a hydrophobic liquid compound, the coated granular fertilizer of the present invention can be produced by a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer simultaneously with an unhardened urethane resin, a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer before coating with a urethane resin, a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added, after coating with a urethane resin, to the granular fertilizer coated with a urethane resin, and the like, in the above-mentioned method for producing a coated granular fertilizer, and preferably, produced by a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer before coating with a urethane resin.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in more detailed by production examples and test examples mentioned later, but the present invention is not limited to only examples. Reference Example (production of urethane resin film)<br>
A urethane resin film was produced under the following conditions.<br>
Polyesterpolyols and alkanol described in Tables 1 and 2 and 2,4,6-tris (dimethylaminomethyDphenol (catalyst) were mixed uniformly at about 60°C, and then, an aromatic polyisocyanate was added, mixed quickly and drawn into a sheet using an applicator set at a thickness of about 125pm (for degradation test). The drawn resin was allowed to stand at VO'C for 3 hours to cause hardening, obtaining urethane resin films (A) to (F) and (a).<br>

Test Example 2 (film permeability test of urethane resin film)<br>
Using a film permeability experiment apparatus (manufactured by VIDREX, for flat plate film), film permeability of urea in films (A), (B), (C) and (D) were measured.   53ml of a 72% aqueous urea solution was charged<br>
5 in one cell of the film permeability experiment apparatus, and 63 ml of ion-exchanged water was charged in another cell (acceptor side), and the film was sandwiched between these cells and kept at 50°C. During the test, the solution in each cell was being stirred. After given days, the aqueous solution was sampled from the acceptor side, and the amount of urea<br>
.0 permeated through the film was measured. Based on degrees of film permeation calculated by the following calculation formula, relative degrees of film permeation of films of the urethane resin, hypothesizing the degree of film permeation of film (a) is 1, are shown in Table 3.<br>

produced by coating granular urea (large granular urea, particle size: about<br>
 <br>
24<br>
3mm, number of granule per gram: 60) with urethane resins of raw material composition (C) described in Table 1.<br>
In a rotary bath, 1000 parts by weight of granular urea was made into tumbling condition, and the granular urea was heated up to about 70'C by<br>
5 hot air. Next, 15 parts by weight of liquid paraffin was added and tumbling thereof was continued for 10 minutes. Further, 5 parts by weight of an unhardened urethane resin having the composition deecribed in Table 1 was added. The unhardened urethane resin was prepared just before the use by mixing the polyesterpolyol, alkanol and 2,4,6*tri8(dimethylaminomethyl)<br>
10 phenol (catalyst) uniformly at about 70°C, adding the aromatic polyisocyanate thereto and mixing them quickly. After the addition of the unhardened urethane resin, the mixture was kept the tumbling condition under heating for 3 minutes or more. Further, addition of the unhardened urethane resin and keeping of the tumbling condition under heating were<br>
.5     repeated until the total amount of the unhardened urethane resin added reached 100 parts by weight.   Thereafter, the mixture was cooled down to around room temperature, to obtain coated granular urea (C). Production example 2<br>

K.K.), 3 parts by weight of a mixture of 2.5 parts by weight of polyvinyl alcohol (GOHSENOL GL-05 (manufactured by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) and 0.5 parts by weight of PVA 217S (manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd.), 12 parts by weight of bentonite (BENTONITE FUJI,<br>
5	manufactured by Hojun Kogyo K.K.), 2 parts by weight of polyoxyethylene<br>
fityryl phenyl ether (SOLPOL T-20, manufactured by Toho Chemical<br>
Industry Co., Ltd.) and 51.9 parts by weight of a calcium carbonate powder<br>
(TANCAL NN200, manufactured by Nitto Funka Kogyo K.K.) were mixed<br>
sufficiently in a juice mixer, to obtain a powder mixture.   To the powder<br>
0 mixture was added 15 parts by weight of water containing 12,0 parts by weight of granulated sugar and 1.6 parts by weight of urea dissolved therein, and the mixture was kneaded sufficiently. The resultant kneaded material was granulated by a compact extrusion granulation machine equipped with a 0.9mm(|i screen, and the particle size was regulated, then, the granules<br>
6	were dried at eO^C for 16 minutes to obtain an inner core in the form of<br>
cylinder (granule size: 1400 to 850)im, average diameter of cross-section:<br>
0.9mm4»).<br>
In a rotary bath, 100 parts by weight of the above-mentioned inner core was made into tumbling condition, and the inner core was heated up to<br>
!0 about YO^C by hot air. Next, 0.26 parts by weight of an unhardened urethane resin (D) described in Table 1 was added. The unhardened urethane resin (D) was prepared by mixing the polyesterpolyol, alkanol and 4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol (catalyst) described in Table 1 uniformly at about 50°C, adding the aromatic polyisocyanate and mixing<br>
15 quickly just before the use. After addition of the unhardened urethane resin, the tumbling condition was kept under heating for 3 minutes or more. Further, addition of the unhardened urethane resin and keeping of the<br>
 <br>
26<br>
tumbling condition under heating for 3 minutes were repeated until the total amount of the unhardened urethane resin added reached 4.00 parts by weight. Thereafter, the mixture was cooled down to around room temperature, to obtain coated pesticidal granule.<br>
5     Test Example 3<br>
200mg of the coated pesticidal granule obtained in Production Example 2 was placed in a 100ml glass tube, 100ml of ion-exchanged water was added thereto and the mixture was allowed to stand still at 25°C. After one week, a small amount of the mixture was sampled, and the content of H-(l,l,3-<br>
LO     trimethyl'2-oxa-4-indanyl)-5-chloro"l,3-dimethylpyra2ole-4'carboxamide eluted from the coated pesticidal granule was measured.   The elution ratio was 73%.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
L5	In the coated granule containing a bioactive substance, a resin forming<br>
a coat shows degradability in soil, and there is controllability of suitable elution of the bioactive substance.<br>
