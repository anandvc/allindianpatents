Statement Regarding Federally Funded Research<br>
Not Applicable<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cyclic siloxanes, suitable for use in a variety of applications including personal care formulations, perfumes, household products, detergents, rinse additives, automotive, textiles and molding materials, wherein the cyclic siloxane has been chemically modified to release an active ingredient upon hydrolysis. The present invention further relates to such molecules where the rate of active ingredient release is sufficiently slow so that products formulated with the modified cyclic siloxane exhibit the desired effect for long periods of time.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The slow, sustained release of an active ingredient is a highly desirable trait in many personal care, textile, automotive, plastic, laundry and household products. A number of means have been proposed and implemented to achieve this goal. Among these means are dissolving or suspending fragrant compounds in personal care emulsions (US 5,525,588; US 5,525,555; US 5,490,982; US 5,372,806; EP 0334490; WO 0064497), encapsulation of a fragrant compound (US 5,500,223; US 5,324,444; US 5,185,155; US 5,176,903; US 5,130,171; US 6,325,859; US 6,309,715; US 6,325,274; US 6,213,409; US 6,200,949; US 6,042,792; US 5,867,755; US 5,049,182 US 6,624,136; US patent applications<br>
20020187221, 20020009522, and 20010008635; EP 1116515, EP 1061124, EP 1133929; WO 0179303, WO 0173188Al, WO 9815192A1, WO 02076514), dissolving a fragrant compound into a hydrophobic phase such as a silicone (US 5,449,512; US 5,160,494; US 5,234,689; WO 0241709A1), incorporation of a fragrant compound into cross!inked polymers (US 6,435,423; US 5,139,864; US 6,379,689; US 5,387,622; US 5,387,411; WO 03032749; WO 02065858; JP 11047581), incorporation of fragrant compounds into permeable laminates (US 6,500,444; US 5,071,704; US 5,008,115), incorporation of fragrant compounds into matrices that soften at body temperature (US 4,908,208; EP 1178107; WO 0016643), incorporation of fragrant compounds into matrices that biodegrade (US 6,121,343) or are bioactivated (US 5,378,468), incorporation of fragrant compounds into rate controlling membranes (US 6,063,365 and US 4,445,641), and derivatization of silanes with fragrant alcohols to form alkoxy silanes (US 4,524,018 and US 4,500,725), derivatization of fragrances to form photosensitive molecules that release the fragrance upon exposure to light (WO 02083620; JP2002020783A). Derivatization of actives to give hydrolyzable organic (i.e., not containing silicon) molecules has also been well documented in the literature.<br>
The marriage of silicon-containing molecules with active ingredients is of particular interest since many active ingredients are highly functional organics and suffer from incompatibility with the silicones that are found in personal and consumer care products, leading to syneresis and other phase separation phenomena. Derivatization of silanes with long-chain alcoholic skin care actives to give alkoxy trimethysilanes (US 5,847,179) and derivatization of silanes with hydroxycarboxylic acid skin exfoliants to form (triorganosilyl)alkoxycarboxylates (US 6,143,309; US 6,228,380; US 6,267,977) have been described. Direct displacement of an alkoxy leaving group on a silicon atom by a fragrant alcohol was reported by Allen, et al. to give fragrant silicon esters or linear silicate esters (US 3,215,719 and US 3,271,305). Several<br>
others also reported similar alkoxy displacement reaction to form linear fragrant siloxane polymers .or copolymers (GB 2,041,964; GB 2,042,890; EP 273266). Reaction of an alcohol, aldehyde, ketone or lactone with a silyl hydride in the presence of a metal carboxylate salt and a reducing agent to form linear polymers and copolymers was also reported (WO 9628497). Other routes to fragrant silicones using silyl hydrides were disclosed by Anderson, et al. (EP'878497, JP 10330382, US 6,262,287) and Perry, et.al. (US 6,046,156; US 6,077,923; US 6,153,578; US 6,054,547; US 6,075,111; US 6,322,777; US 6,083,901). In these processes, hydrosilylation chemistry was employed to join the active portion of the molecule to the silicone backbone. What is not taught or suggested by the prior art is the formation and use of active ingredient-functional cyclic siloxane compositions for personal care, textile, laundry or plastics applications. Herein we disclose a new composition and method for preparation of active ingredient functional cyclic siloxane articles from cyclic silyl hydrides. The method is the direct reaction of an alcohol- or carbonyl-containing compound with the cyclic silyl hydride in the presence of a catalyst to generate the product and hydrogen gas byproduct.<br>

The compounds of the present invention introduce active ingredients via displacement of a hydride from a cyclic silyl hydride. These siloxane molecules are useful in a variety of personal care compositions. The present invention is directed to new compositions of matter that are cyclic siloxanes that release an alcoholic or enolizable carbonyl-containing active ingredient upon hydrolysis, i.e. an alcohol or carbonyl compound releasing siloxane, where the active ingredient can be illustrated by but not limited to adhesion promoters, adhesives, anti-aging agents, antioxidants, antiperspirants, antistatic agents, biocides, bittering agents, bleaching agents, brighteners,<br>

(Figure Removed) where R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or Ci-C24 monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. The quantity v is greater than or equal to 3, and the quantities w and u are each independently at least 1, with the proviso that w+u must be equal to or greater than 3. R3 and R4 are each independently selected from the group consisting of H or Ci-C24 monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. The cyclic hydride employed may be a mixture of cyclics of various sizes and concentrations.<br>
The following synthetic examples are intended to illustrate the general synthetic reactions schemes that a person having ordinary skill in the art of<br>
siloxane chemistry would typically employ in order to prepare the active-containirtg cyclic siloxanes used by the present invention. These reaction schemes are thus illustrative only and do not represent the only synthetic pathway.is!:that may be utilized.<br>
Reactionjscheme 1(Figure Removed) When the starting active ingredient is an alcohol, as depicted in reaction scheme I, the corresponding alkoxysiloxane is produced, preferably in the presence'tpf a suitable catalyst.<br>
Reaction scheme II:<br>
(Figure Removed) The reaction of a carbonyl-containing active, as depicted in reaction schemes II and III, requires the establishment a carbonyl-enol tautomeric equilibrium, which is assisted by a base such as triethylamine or a silanolate salt.<br>
Tautomerism is the chemical phenomenon of the establishment of an equilibrium between two or more structurally distinct compounds. In nearly all cases, the difference between one tautomeric form of the equilibrium compounds and the other is the isomeric placement of a hydrogen atom. A prevalent form of tautomerism is the tautomeric equilibrium established between a carbonyl compound (i.e. one containing a carbonyl group) and having a hydrogen atom alpha to the carbonyl group, i.e. an a hydrogen:(Figure Removed)eto FormEnol FormGenerally the equilibrium constant favors the keto form and the equilibrium lies well to the left. The extent of enolization is greatly affected by solvent, concentration and temperature. When a strong base is present, both the enol and the keto form can lose a hydrogen ion (a proton), forming an enolate anion:<br>
(Figure Removed)these structures differ only in the placement of electrons, these are canonical forms of the same ion rather than tautomeric isorhers. Because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, the predominate canonical form is the one where the ionic charge is more localized on the oxygen atom. While the tautomeric equilibrium between enols and ketones or aldehydes is not normally a preparative reaction, the equilibrium must occur since ketones and aldehydes often react through their enol forms as they do instantly in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. This keto-enol tautomeric equilibrium is also established for esters or organic acids, i.e. in the structures above when R8 includes an oxygen bound to an appropriate R group, e.g. OR', the compound is an organic ester. For a more detailed explanation of this chemistry see J. March "Advanced Organic Chemistry," John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1985), pp. 66-68 and 527 - 529 and references therein.<br>
Fragrant molecules, alcohols, ketones and aldehydes, may be reacted as the alcohol or enol tautomer to produce silicone or siloxanes bearing fragrant moieties. The reaction involves reaction of the alcoholic or enolic form of the molecule with hydrogen, hydroxyl or halogen directly bonded to a silicon atom to form the fragrant derivative. The reaction involves formation of the conjugate base related to the alcohol or enol tautomeric form of the molecule:<br>
FragOH dissociates to H+ and FragO' (conjugate base);<br>
where FragOH is a fragrant alcohol or the enol form of a fragrant ketone or aldehyde. Aldehydes and ketones react with alcohol(s) R'OH to form<br>
hemiacetals (derived from aldehydes) or hemiketals (derived from ketones):RCH(O) + R'OH -&gt; RCH(OH)(OR') hemiacetal, which has a conjugate base obtained by removing the hydroxyl hydrogen: RCH(O-)(OR') and RC(O)R" + R'OH -&gt; RC(OH)(R'O)R" which has a conjugate base likewise obtained by removing the hydroxyl hydrogen: RC(O)(R'O)R". As used herein the various Frag are fragrant moieties, i.e. monovalent radicals, either as a neutrally charged monovalent radical (Frag or FragO) or as a charged monovalent radical derived from the conjugate bases of fragrant molecules, e.g. Frag+ + O2 -&gt; FragO- , where the monovalent radicals are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having from one to one hundred carbon atoms, preferably four to one hundred carbon atoms, more preferably five to one hundred carbon atoms and most preferably six to one hundred carbon atoms where the radical may also contain heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and the halogens fluorine , chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
While the tautomeric equilibrium between enols and their corresponding carbonyl-containing compounds is not normally a preparative reaction, the equilibrium must occur since carbonyl-containing compounds often react through their enol forms, as they do instantly in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. As the enol form reacts to give the desired product, more of the carbonyl form tautomerizes to the enol form to maintain equilibrium until the entirety of the carbonyl-containing compound has reacted to give the enol-functionalizecl siloxane.<br>
The syntheses described above are preferably performed in the presence of a catalyst. For active-containing siloxanes derived from alcohols, several families of catalysts can be used. These include but are not limited to transition metal catalysts, bases, and Lewis acids.<br>

where R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or Q-C24 rnonovalent hydrocarbon radicals. The quantity v is greater than or equal to 3, and the quantities w and u are each independently at least 1, with the proviso that w+u must be equal to or greater than 3. R3 and R4 are each independently selected from the group consisting of H or d-C24 rnonovalent hydrocarbon radicals. The cyclic hydride employed may be a mixture of cyclics of various sizes and concentrations.<br>
The cyclic silicone hydride is reacted under conditions as outlined above to produce an active-releasing siloxane having formula I or II:<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
where the components and subscripts satisfy the previous definitions and requirements. This siloxane undergoes a slow hydrolysis under most conditions of use whereby the siloxane releases an active ingredient upon hydrolysis. This imparts a desirable effect to many different useful compositions such as cosmetics and household products.<br>
The active-releasing compounds of the present invention are particularly suited to incorporation into personal care products to impart a long-lasting, desirable effect to the products. Suitable uses include but are not limited to deodorants; antiperspirants; skin creams; facial creams; hair care products such as shampoos, mousses, and styling gels; insect repellants; protective creams; shaving creams; after shave; cologne; perfume; color cosmetics such as lipsticks, foundations, blushes, makeup, and mascara; and other cosmetic formulations where other silicon containing components may have been added and where a certain effect is desired.<br>
Incorporation of small amounts of the compositions of the present invention into fragrance products such as shaving lotions, colognes, toilet water, andperfumes can impart a desirable long lasting fragrance to these products. Further, the fragrant cyclic siloxanes of the present invention may be incorporated into other products where it is desirable to mask unpleasant odors with a pleasant fragrance, for example household cleaning products such as waxes and polishes, automobile cleaning products such as waxes and polishes, detergents; textile coatings, paints, and varnishes.<br>
In addition, the active-containing cyclic siloxanes of the present invention may be used in laundry applications such as rinse additives, softeners and the like, subject to the limitation that the active-containing cyclic siloxanes of the present invention be compatible or capable of being rendered compatible with the product in which it is incorporated.<br>

The genial procedure for hydrolysis is as follows:<br>
A 3.3 cm by 3.3 cm swatch of untreated cotton cloth was soaked with each<br>
material such that the molar equivalents of active ingredient were equal<br>
between all of the samples. Each swatch was kept in a small aluminum pan, and all of the pans were kept in an open-top box in the same room at ambient temperature and- and humidity. The samples were smelled at timed intervals and rated for strength of scent (0 = no scent, 5 = same strength as pure active ingredient, from the bottle). Data are presented in Tables 6 and 7. In both example' 15 (Table 6) and 16 (Table 7), it can be seen that the cloth treated with the siloxane derivative of the present invention release a stronger odor for a longer period of time.<br>
