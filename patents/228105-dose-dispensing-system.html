				<td>DOSE DISPENSING SYSTEM AND APPARATUS<br>
This invention relates to a dose dispensing system and<br>
apparatus, particularly though not exclusively for<br>
dispensing doses of drugs and other like medicaments.<br>
It can, however, be used in analogous areas where<br>
controlled dispensing of materials is desired. It is<br>
of particular value for dispensing measured doses of<br>
fluent medication from a storage container containing<br>
a reservoir of such medication, although it can also<br>
be used to dispense unit dosages of solids such as,<br>
for example, tablets.<br>
Pharmaceutical packaging is normally designed to make<br>
access by the patient easy and unrestricted. There<br>
are, however, situations where considerations of<br>
safety and security make it necessary to control and<br>
record the usage of medicines by patients.<br>
Additionally, supervision of dosage by medical,<br>
nursing and care staff is time-consuming and costly,<br>
particularly if the patient is not in a hospital or<br>
other care facility. This is especially the case if<br>
the patient needs to take a combination of medicines<br>
with a strict regime of medication. Also, while in<br>
the case of many medicaments and pharmaceuticals the<br>
dosage regime may be subject to wide variation without<br>
potential danger to the patient on the one hand or<br>
loss of effectiveness of the medication on the other,<br>
it is well understood that medication is desirably<br>
effected using a regular dosage regime. It is found<br>
that this is not always easiest achieved simply by<br>
relying on a patient to follow written instructions.<br>
Attempts have accordingly been made to develop devices<br>
which are themselves essentially "programmed" to<br>
dispense medicament at the correct intervals, but such<br>
systems have tended to be of narrow applicability and<br><br>
complex and, indeed, to be easily defeated. Thus,<br>
suggestions have been made in the case of multiple<br>
pill-based medication regimes, to provide automated<br>
dispensing devices. US-A-5,752,621 and US-A-5,472,113<br>
both disclose apparatus which can be used to dispense,<br>
at appropriate times, various pills in appropriate<br>
combinations. Further prior art dispensing apparatus<br>
is referred to in each of these specifications.<br>
Devices for dispensing fluent materials such as drugs<br>
and medicaments are known in a wide variety of forms.<br>
Generally they consist of a container which is sealed<br>
and from which a suitable dose of material may be<br>
ejected. One particular widespread presentation for<br>
drugs, particularly the treatment of asthma, is that<br>
of a small pressurised canister having a valve at one<br>
end and a dispensing tube fitted with a nozzle. So-<br>
called inhalers are well-known and widely used by<br>
asthmatics. In principle, however, such a<br>
presentation is not in any sense restricted to drugs<br>
for use in treating asthma, but can be used for a wide<br>
variety of medicaments and pharmaceuticals. The mode<br>
of administration additionally does not always have to<br>
be by way of an aerosol spray. For example, it is<br>
entirely conceivable to dispense pasty or creamy<br>
formulations from a canister with some form of pump<br>
valve on it. Even discrete dosage forms such as pills<br>
may be presented in container from which pills may be<br>
released one at a time. This is a particularly<br>
preferred dosage approach presentation for homeopathic<br>
remedies where it is believed highly desirable that<br>
the pill may be taken without being handled by the<br>
person taking it more than strictly necessary.<br>
Alternatively, pills may be incorporated into a strip<br>
or ribbon which may be fed out from a cassette or the<br>
like one by one, and released from the strip for<br>
administration.<br><br>
A separate consideration in connection with the<br>
administration of medicaments arises in the case of<br>
controlled clinical trials, or even, though to a<br>
lesser extent, patient monitoring. It is particularly<br>
important in a controlled clinical trial to ensure not<br>
only that the dosage regime is followed, but that a<br>
positive record is secured which enables that to be<br>
verified. Any such system should, of course, not be<br>
capable of being falsified by the patient.<br>
A further separate consideration which applies in some<br>
cases is the strong desirability of avoiding<br>
overdosing. This can be of particular importance in<br>
the case of medicaments used in diabetes treatment<br>
where they can have extremely adverse effects if not<br>
used in the right quantity at the right time.<br>
Yet a further problem which arises in connection with<br>
the controlled administration of medicaments in<br>
unsupervised conditions is to ensure that the right<br>
medicament is being administered, and in the case of<br>
controlled or prescription medicines, that no<br>
diversion occurs.<br>
We have now found that substantial advantages may be<br>
obtained, but in cost-effective fashion, by providing<br>
improved dispensing systems which enable a dose of<br>
medicament or the like to be dispensed from a sealed<br>
or sealable container in accordance with a programmed<br>
regime and which are so arranged that the regime must<br>
essentially be adhered to.<br>
Our earlier WO 02/32487 discloses a dispensing system<br>
consisting of a programmable dispensing mechanism<br>
adapted to receive a sealed or resealable container<br>
containing multiple doses of material to be dispensed,<br>
and including a mechanical actuation mechanism which,<br><br>
when actuated, causes a measured dose of material to<br>
be dispensed from the material container, and wherein<br>
the mechanism may be inhibited from operation by a<br>
locking mechanism which, when actuated, locks the<br>
device against the further dispensing of a dose of<br>
material until released in accordance with a desired<br>
dispensing programme, and wherein the container and<br>
dispensing mechanism are provided with means enabling<br>
the authenticity of the container placed in the<br>
dispensing mechanism to be checked.<br>
Such release may be effected, for example, merely by<br>
the passage of sufficient time or, and this is<br>
generally preferred, by means of the release of a<br>
suitable latching mechanism which acts to lock the<br>
device against dispensing until such release is<br>
effective. The latching mechanism may be mechanical,<br>
electrical or electromechanical, but, in every case,<br>
must be as a whole programmable with the desired<br>
dosage regime. The release may be effected by<br>
suitable actuation locally or by remote control.<br>
Preferably the container has an identification tag<br>
associated therewith and containing information about<br>
its content, and the dispensing mechanism includes<br>
means for addressing the tag and validating the dosage<br>
regime in accordance with a preset programme. The tag<br>
may take the form of a simple marking on the face of<br>
the container such as a barcode, or it may be a more<br>
sophisticated form of tag including data about the<br>
medicament and how that medicament is made or<br>
information relating to the manufacturing and supply<br>
of the medicament. It may even be in the form of a<br>
"smart card" which enables information not only to be<br>
extracted from the tag but also written to the tag.<br>
Data and power may be transferred by direct physical<br>
contact, or remotely via an RF field.<br><br>
It is particularly preferred to provide a dispensing<br>
system in two parts, one of which can be envisioned as<br>
a hand-held hand-actuated dispensing mechanism and the<br>
other as a base or docking station into which the<br>
hand-held unit may be placed in order to release the<br>
latch. Such a docking or base station may be more or<br>
less sophisticated and may be self-standing, or<br>
alternatively it may operate in cooperation with a<br>
remote overall control system, for example a remote<br>
computer or computers. In one specific aspect of the<br>
present invention, the docking station may contain<br>
transmitter/receiver means for communicating with a<br>
central control computer enabling exchange of<br>
signals/data between the remote computer and the base<br>
or docking station and accordingly, if the dispensing<br>
device is placed in the base or docking station,<br>
between the remote computer and the dispensing device.<br>
In such a system, it is entirely possible to arrange<br>
by means of suitable programming and suitable easily<br>
implemented electronics that the dispensing history of<br>
the hand-held device can be uploaded to a central<br>
remote computer at the same time or adjacent in time<br>
to the remote computer sending the hand-held device<br>
appropriate control signals.<br>
The means of communication between a base or docking<br>
station and a remote computer can be any appropriate<br>
means, for example using cellular telephony<br>
techniques, via the Internet or via any other<br>
appropriate communications mechanism.<br>
It is also possible to provide, in the hand-held<br>
dispensing device, means for communicating with a<br>
separate standard computer device, for example a<br>
personal computer, palm-top, PDA or mobile<br>
communications device. By including an infra-red or<br>
RF communications port in the hand-held device, once<br><br>
communication is established with the docking station<br>
and communication is actuated, a dialogue may be<br>
established between the patient and a host computer or<br>
even with a physician or other adviser. Thus, it is<br>
possible, at the same time as dealing with the basic<br>
reporting of past use of the device, to enable the<br>
patient to fill in a questionnaire, or to enter into<br>
the system a query about their condition or a report<br>
of current state of health. This "telemedicine"<br>
aspect to the dispensing system provides very<br>
substantial flexibility of communication between<br>
patient and doctor, and enhances clinical care<br>
opportunities.<br>
While such a system is extremely beneficial, patient<br>
compliance will be patchy such that a patient may end<br>
up entering data significantly after the event, when<br>
the data may not be as accurate as it would be if it<br>
were entered at the correct time. In the worst case,<br>
the patient can fail to enter the data entirely.<br>
WO 01/93801 discloses an apparatus similar to that<br>
disclosed in WO 02/32487. The device is provided with<br>
input means allowing a user to input certain<br>
information on medication consumption. This<br>
information is primarily required to allow the unit to<br>
compute the desired time at which the medication can<br>
be dispensed. The information is stored locally to<br>
the device and can be read out later if required and<br>
used for research purposes. This goes some way to<br>
overcoming the problems with ensuring that the patient<br>
enters the data correctly.<br>
According to the first aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a dispensing system<br>
comprising a dispenser arranged to dispense a quantity<br>
of material; a locking mechanism on the dispenser to<br><br>
prevent dispensing of the material; a user interface<br>
allowing the user to input data; and a control device<br>
remote from the dispenser, the control device arranged<br>
to receive the input data and to enable release of the<br>
locking mechanism to allow dispensing of the material.<br>
The present invention offers considerable improvement<br>
over the system of WO 01/93801. As the control of the<br>
locking mechanism is carried out remotely this ensures<br>
that the data entered by the patient must be received<br>
remotely prior to the dispenser being released to<br>
provide a further dosage. This ensures that the data<br>
is guaranteed to be received remotely and that it is<br>
received in real time. With WO 01/93801, there is no<br>
such guarantee as the local device memory is only read<br>
out at a later date. Further, as the data is received<br>
remotely in real time, it is possible for a medical<br>
practitioner to read and interpret the data before<br>
allowing a user to take another dosage of the<br>
medicament. Such an option is not available in the<br>
device of WO 01/93801.<br>
By allowing the patient to communicate in this way,<br>
the number of possibilities are opened up. For<br>
example, the device can obtain information from the<br>
patient in order to make a positive identification of<br>
the patient. This may take the form of a number of<br>
predetermined questions to which only the authorised<br>
individual would know the answers. Alternatively,<br>
more sophisticated identification techniques such as<br>
fingerprints and retinal scans can be used.<br>
Alternatively, the patient may be faced with a test to<br>
determine his/her reaction time allowing the system to<br>
determine his/her level of intoxication and regulate<br>
the dosage pattern accordingly.<br><br>
In the case of clinical trials or similar procedures,<br>
the system of the invention enables a substantial<br>
degree of control and monitoring to be easily and<br>
cost-effectively carried out without the ease of use<br>
of the medicament for the user or patient being<br>
compromised.<br>
Under certain circumstance, it may be advantageous to<br>
activate the locking mechanism if the data has not<br>
been entered by a fixed time. The system can be<br>
arranged such that the locking mechanism can then only<br>
be released by the control device.<br>
In its simplest form, the control device may simply<br>
detect that information has been received and release<br>
the locking mechanism accordingly. However, in a more<br>
sophisticated device, the control device may make some<br>
qualitative assessment of the input data, for example<br>
by determining that all of a desired number of<br>
questions have been answered. Alternatively, the<br>
control device may include a display to display the<br>
input data allowing manual assessment of the data<br>
before the locking mechanism is released.<br>
As mentioned previously, the system can dispense any<br>
material, but is particularly designed for medicament.<br>
The medicament may be in the form of tablets, but is<br>
preferably in a fluid form which is dispensable in a<br>
number of measured doses. The invention is applicable<br>
to any type of dispenser with a suitable locking<br>
mechanism. However, it is particularly applicable to<br>
the device of WO 02/32487.<br>
In the broadest sense, with this device, the dispenser<br>
is adapted to receive a sealed or resealable container<br>
of material to be dispensed and includes a mechanical<br>
actuation mechanism which, when actuated, causes a<br>
measured dose of material to be dispensed from the<br><br>
material container, and the actuation mechanism may be<br>
inhibited from operation by the locking mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the container and dispenser are provided<br>
with means enabling the authenticity of the container<br>
placed in the dispenser to be checked.<br>
Preferably, the dispenser is a portable hand-held<br>
device.<br>
The system preferably includes a separate base or<br>
docking station into or near which the hand-held unit<br>
may be placed in order to release the locking<br>
mechanism.<br>
The present invention also aims to provide a system<br>
having a more flexible means of configuring the<br>
dispensing mechanism.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention<br>
there is provided a dispensing system consisting of a<br>
programmable dispensing mechanism adapted to receive a<br>
sealed or resealable container containing multiple<br>
doses of material to be dispensed, and including a<br>
mechanical actuation mechanism which, when actuated,<br>
causes a measured dose of material to be dispensed<br>
from the material container, and wherein the actuator<br>
mechanism may be inhibited from operation by a locking<br>
mechanism which, when actuated, locks the device<br>
against further dispensing of a dose of material until<br>
the release in accordance with a desired dispensing<br>
programme; further comprising a cartridge to be<br>
received in the dispensing mechanism in place of the<br>
container of material to be dispensed, the cartridge<br>
containing user specific data, means in the dispensing<br>
mechanism to read the data, and control means to<br>
control the operation of the dispensing mechanism in<br><br>
accordance with the data.<br>
With this arrangement, the patient can be provided<br>
with a cartridge containing patient specific<br>
information, such as the type of drugs and the<br>
intended dosage regime. This cartridge can be used to<br>
configure a dispenser. If the user has a number of<br>
dispensers, for example one for use at home, one for<br>
use in the car and one for use at work, all of these<br>
dispensers can be configured using the cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the cartridge and the dispensing mechanism<br>
are provided with means enabling the authenticity of<br>
the cartridge placed in the dispensing mechanism to be<br>
checked. In this way, the system can be programmed so<br>
that only those dispensing mechanisms allocated to a<br>
particular user can be configured by the cartridge.<br>
The system can also record if a user has attempted to<br>
use the cartridge to configure an unauthorised<br>
dispensing mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the data in the cartridge can be<br>
reprogrammed. This will allow a medical worker to<br>
reconfigure a patient's cartridge, for example to<br>
change the dosage pattern. Also, a medical worker<br>
would be able to change the information on the device<br>
to override the date from the cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the data on the cartridge includes a user<br>
specific PIN code. If the dispensing mechanism<br>
requires a user to input a PIN code for operation,<br>
this code can also be included in the cartridge. If<br>
the user forgets his code, the cartridge can be<br>
inserted into the mechanism to remind the user of the<br>
code.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention aims to<br><br>
provide an additional degree of control pf the<br>
dispensing operation.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention<br>
there is provided a dispensing system comprising a<br>
dispenser arranged to dispense a quantity of material;<br>
a locking mechanism on the dispenser to prevent<br>
dispensing of the material; a position detector to<br>
detect the position of the dispenser; and a control<br>
means to activate the locking mechanism to prevent<br>
dispensing of the material if the position detector<br>
indicates that the dispenser is not within a fixed<br>
location.<br>
Thus, the invention allows those prescribing<br>
medication to be able to control the location where<br>
the medication is taken. For example, the dispensing<br>
system can be configured such that it will only<br>
dispense medication in a specific clinic or hospital.<br>
In its simplest form, the position detector may be a<br>
means to monitor when the dispensing mechanism is<br>
beyond a given radius from a fixed point. For<br>
example, a docking station may be provided with an RF<br>
link to the dispensing mechanism. In this case, the<br>
position detector is able to determine the distance<br>
between the docking station and the dispensing system<br>
and to actuate the locking mechanism if the dispensing<br>
mechanism is further than a given distance from the<br>
docking station.<br>
For a more sophisticated system the absolute position<br>
of the dispensing mechanism may be detected, for<br>
example using a global positioning (GPS), cellular<br>
positioning (CPS) or triangulation system. This will<br>
provide operators with greater flexibility to limit<br>
the dispensing of material to certain regions.<br><br>
As mentioned previously, the system can dispense any<br>
material, but is particularly designed for medicament.<br>
The medicament may be in the form of tablets, but is<br>
preferably in a fluid form which is dispensable in a<br>
number of measured doses. The invention is applicable<br>
to any type of dispenser with a suitable locking<br>
mechanism. However, it is particularly applicable to<br>
the device of WO 02/32487.<br>
In the broadest sense, with this device, the dispenser<br>
is adapted to receive a sealed or resealable container<br>
of material to be dispensed and includes a mechanical<br>
actuation mechanism which, when actuated, causes a<br>
measured dose of material to be dispensed from the<br>
material container, and the actuation mechanism may be<br>
inhibited from operation by the locking mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the container and dispenser are provided<br>
with means enabling the authenticity of the container<br>
placed in the dispenser to be checked.<br>
Preferably, the dispenser is a portable, hand-held<br>
device. The system preferably includes a separate<br>
base or docking station into or near which the hand-<br>
held unit must be placed in order to release the<br>
locking mechanism.<br>
The three aspects of the invention may be used<br>
independently, or together in any combination.<br>
The preferred medicaments for dispensing using the<br>
system include unlicensed drugs undergoing clinical<br>
trials and controlled drugs such as, drug dependence<br>
drugs, for example, narcotics or opiates including<br>
cocaine, diamorphine, morphine and the synthetic<br>
opioids, amphetamines, flunitrazepam, temazepam,<br>
barbiturates, cannabis (or drugs derived therefrom),<br><br>
and lysergide. Indeed any drug defined under the<br>
Misuse of drugs Act 1971 as a class A, B or C drug or<br>
those defined under the Misuse of drugs regulations<br>
1985 as a schedule 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 drug would be<br>
particularly suited for use with the system of the<br>
invention.<br>
The inventions are illustrated by way of example with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a drug dispensing unit and base station<br>
in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the unit of Figure 1 about to be used;<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram of one aspect of the<br>
operating system;<br>
Figure 4 shows an alternative general view of an<br>
alternative dispensing unit and base station;<br>
Figure 5 shows the unit of Figure 4 in use;<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show in exploded view from front and<br>
back respectively a third embodiment of a drug-<br>
dispensing unit and base station in accordance with<br>
the invention; and<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view of a cartridge for<br>
insertion into the dispenser previously described.<br>
Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a dispensing<br>
unit generally denoted 1 which can be placed on top of<br>
a base unit generally denoted 2. The base unit is<br>
connected via a power and signal cable 3 with<br>
appropriate related apparatus, for example to a<br>
telephone socket or to a PC interface card. The upper<br><br>
face of the docking station 2 carries a row of<br>
connector terminals 5 which can, when the dispensing<br>
unit 1 is placed on the docking station, electrically<br>
contact corresponding members (not shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2) located on the underside of the dispensing unit<br>
1.<br>
The dispensing unit itself is provided with a liquid<br>
crystal display screen 10 and some function buttons<br>
11, and has at its upper end a nozzle actuation cap 12<br>
with a lowerable closure tab 13 which can be used to<br>
cover an aerosol outlet 14 in cap 12, thus preventing<br>
the aerosol outlet being clogged with dust, dirt or<br>
other contamination.<br>
Cap 12 may be releasable from the upper end of the<br>
main body of the dispensing device as shown in the<br>
drawings to enable a canister with a standardised<br>
outlet tube to be located within it, the outlet tube<br>
being registered with an appropriate aerosol nozzle<br>
14. By pressing the cap 12 down into the main body of<br>
dispensing device 1, the aerosol valve may be actuated<br>
and a dose of material expelled, whereafter an<br>
electromechanical latch within the main body of the<br>
dispensing device 1 may act to prevent the cap 12<br>
being pushed into the body of dispensing device 1 a<br>
second time until release occurs. Release may occur<br>
merely following the passing of a given period of<br>
time, but it is highly desirable more positively to<br>
control the ability of the device to dispense. For<br>
this purpose, it is straightforward to arrange that<br>
the latch within the main body of dispensing device 1<br>
will remain locked to prevent a further depression of<br>
cap 12 until appropriate steps are taken to release<br>
it. For example, release may be effected remotely in<br>
accordance with a programmed regime by placing the<br>
dispensing unit 1 on to the base station 2 and<br><br>
thereafter having the dispensing station and the base<br>
station communicate with one another, whereon, if<br>
appropriate, the internal latching may be released.<br>
The status of the dispensing device 1 may be shown on<br>
screen 10, both before and after placing on the base<br>
station. A number of push buttons 11 are provided in<br>
order to control input from the user, for example to<br>
enable the user to set up a communication link with<br>
the remote computer via the base station 2.<br>
Once such a link has been established and e.g. the<br>
latch released so that a second dose may be dispensed,<br>
the dispensing device 1 may be removed from the base<br>
station, held in the hand as shown in Figure 2, and<br>
the cap again depressed in the direction of arrow 30<br>
shown on Figure 2. It is easy to arrange that when<br>
such actuation occurs, the latch within the dispensing<br>
unit 1 re-engages to prevent a second dispensing<br>
action and separately the status of dispensing unit<br>
may change, the change being displayed in window 10.<br>
Alternatively, the device may include suitable control<br>
circuitry internally, such circuitry acting to release<br>
locking and enable a further dose to be dispensed<br>
after a suitable period of time, and preferably<br>
including a rewritable memory store to maintain a<br>
record of when doses were in fact administered and<br>
when and how the device was interacted with by the<br>
user. The content of such a store may be<br>
automatically transferred to a store in the docking<br>
station when the device is docked, or transferred<br>
direct to a remote computer if desired.<br>
It is often desirable to record additional information<br>
from a patient, for example as to their general state<br>
of well being and the effect that the medication has<br>
had on them. This can be a useful diagnostic tool for<br><br>
medical practitioners, and is particularly useful in<br>
the case of clinical trials. The device therefore<br>
includes a means for inputting this information. In<br>
its simplest form, this could take the form of a set<br>
of questions being displayed on the LCD screen 10 with<br>
a set of multiple choice answers which the user<br>
selects using function buttons 11. The function<br>
buttons 11 could also be used to input text. However,<br>
this is likely to be time consuming, and if text input<br>
is required, some further device such as lap top<br>
computer, PDA, or communications device can be<br>
connected to the base station 2 either physically or<br>
remotely. Alternatively the communications devices<br>
and input devices could have their own link<br>
to the remote computer alleviating the need to connect<br>
to the base station 2. Alternatively, for patients<br>
having difficulty with their manual dexterity, the<br>
input device could be a microphone to record the<br>
necessary information orally. This can then be<br>
converted to text using voice recognition software<br>
either locally, or at the remote computer.<br>
Alternatively, the text could be typed manually.<br>
In order to ensure patient compliance with the<br>
requirements to enter this text, the remote computer<br>
is set so as not to release the latch until the<br>
information has been recorded, processed and a<br>
determination as to what course of action should be<br>
taken with respect to the locking or unlocking of the<br>
latch has been made from the recorded information<br>
and/or the other data from the remote system.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the operation of this aspect of the<br>
invention. The patient inputs data through device 1,<br>
or some other device as described above as step 15.<br>
This data is transmitted to a remote hub providing a<br>
control device where it is processed as step 16 and<br><br>
appropriate data is written to a database at step 17.<br>
At step 18, the hub determines whether the received<br>
data necessitates any updating of the device. The<br>
system has a set of rules that will be used to<br>
determine whether or not to update data within the<br>
dispenser which will in turn influence the operation<br>
of the blocking mechanism. Thus, if the hub<br>
determines that the necessary data has been correctly<br>
received and derives from the data that the device<br>
needs to be updated or the locking mechanism state<br>
should be altered, it will update the device at step<br>
19A and will then return to processing at step 19B.<br>
Although this process has been described in relation<br>
to additional data input by the user, it is also<br>
applicable to information received directly from the<br>
device itself relating to the patient usage data.<br>
Thus, for example, the hub can be programmed to<br>
recognise certain unusual dosage patterns and to alert<br>
a medical practitioner, to adjust the dosage regime,<br>
or to lock the device to prevent further usage.<br>
If, for example, a patient has a dosage regime of one<br>
tablet of a drug three times a day, and the control<br>
protocol requires that a patient complete a data entry<br>
in an electronic diary before the next dose can be<br>
taken, the system will automatically restrict the dose<br>
until the diary is completed. An alert can be sent if<br>
the dose is not taken or the diary is not completed<br>
within a prescribed period. This can give a clinical<br>
trial investigator real time information about the<br>
dosing/data recording behaviour of the patient group.<br>
The benefit of this device is that the input data is<br>
clean at source as it must be entered before the next<br>
dose can be dispensed. The system can also be<br>
configured to accept data after the drug has been<br><br>
dispersed.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the closure tab 13 which acts to<br>
shield ingress of dirt into the dispensing outlet 14<br>
has an angled out portion 20 which can be engaged by<br>
the forefinger of the left hand as shown in Figure 2<br>
of the drawings in order to achieve dispensing.<br>
Such an approach is not always desirable, or, indeed,<br>
convenient, and it may be particularly awkward for<br>
people with arthritis. Accordingly, Figures 4 and 5<br>
show an alternative construction where dispensing is<br>
achieved by means of a lateral grip across a generally<br>
oval cross-section elongate housing which covers the<br>
dispensing device. Referring to Figures 4 and 5, the<br>
system consists again basically of a docking station<br>
21 connected via cable 28 and a squeezable dispensing<br>
unit 22. The latter has a display screen 23 in a<br>
slidable central section which can be slid up to<br>
reveal the nozzle of an aerosol dispensing nozzle 24<br>
which is visible in Figure 5, but not in Figure 4.<br>
Likewise visible in Figure 5 but not in Figure 4 is<br>
the set of control buttons 25 which enable the unit to<br>
be controlled by the user.<br>
The mechanical construction enabling a squeezing<br>
movement exerted as shown in Figure 5 to be converted<br>
into an axial compression to release a dose from a<br>
pressurised container via the aerosol nozzle may be<br>
simply effected using appropriate standard mechanical<br>
constructions, and the mechanical arrangements for<br>
latching the device against an immediate second use<br>
can likewise be simply and appropriately constructed.<br>
Located within the housings of the respective<br>
dispensing devices 1 and 22 shown in Figures 1 and 4<br>
respectively are also appropriate electronics and a<br>
power supply or back-up power supply, for example one<br><br>
or more battery cells. If desired, the electronics<br>
may be rechargeable and recharging can take place when<br>
the respective dispensing unit is located on its<br>
docking station 2 or 21. This can obviously be<br>
effected automatically by appropriate design and<br>
programming.<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show a further embodiment of the<br>
dispensing system, in each case in exploded view from<br>
front and back respectively. Referring to these<br>
figures, from which detail has been omitted for the<br>
sake of clarity, the system consists of a base station<br>
50 into which a hand-held dispenser can be set when<br>
needed. A contact pad 51 enables signals to be sent<br>
to and from the hand-held unit when it is placed in<br>
base station 50.<br>
The hand-held unit consists basically of front and<br>
rear casing shells 55, 56 respectively which clip<br>
together round a circuit board 57 and an internal<br>
moulded receptacle unit 58. Shown above unit 58 in<br>
the drawing is a removable cartridge housing 60 which<br>
may be locked into place in the assembled housing or<br>
released therefrom as and when necessary. Cartridge<br>
housing 60 is designed to receive a container of<br>
medicament 62, here in the form of an aerosol spray<br>
canister with a dispensing nozzle 64 which lies in the<br>
upper part of housing 60 having a number of weight<br>
reducing indentations 66, and which is suitably<br>
configured to enable a dose of medicament to be<br>
dispensed sub-lingually via apertures (not shown).<br>
Circuit board 57 bears a latch assembly 70 designed to<br>
interact with portions of housing 60 to enable the<br>
housing to be latched in place or removed upwardly<br>
from the rest of the device. The latching assembly<br>
also allows, at appropriate intervals controlled by<br><br>
programming, the housing 60 to be pushed down in the<br>
upper half of moulding 58 to enable a set of pins 72<br>
to press on the ends of the arms of a spider 74 and so<br>
cause the container 62 to be pressed towards the<br>
nozzle 64, so dispensing a dose of medicament<br>
therefrom. After one (or if programmed appropriately<br>
more) such compressions, the latch assembly may lock<br>
the housing 60 against further such movement until<br>
released when the next dose of medicament is due to be<br>
dispensed. The exact nature of the operation of the<br>
spider 74 and associated components is described in<br>
more detail in our copending application filed on even<br>
date and claiming the priority of GB patent<br>
application 0025811.1<br>
Circuit board 57 carries a display screen 76 visible<br>
through a window 78 in casing front 55. In use of the<br>
device, this screen can carry a message to the user,<br>
for example indicating the state of the device, ready<br>
to dispense or locked. Casing front 55 also has four<br>
apertures 80 which, when the device is assembled, are<br>
filled with rubbery press buttons (not shown in the<br>
drawing), which enable actuation of four switches 82<br>
set in circuit board 57. The upper end 84 of board 57<br>
carries a printed RF antenna which enables the<br>
checking of a so-called RF tag 86 which forms part of<br>
the cartridge assembly. This enables the system to<br>
check just what medicament has been loaded into it<br>
when a fresh container 62 and associated tag 86 are<br>
inserted into the upper housing 60 and that housing<br>
latched into position in moulding 58.<br>
The hand-held unit may be powered by a suitable<br>
battery which can fit in the area denoted 88 in the<br>
drawing.<br>
It will be readily appreciated that using devices as<br><br>
shown in Figures 1, 5 and 6a/6b, the degree of control<br>
of dosage can be very high and the ease of recording<br>
and monitoring of the dosage regime is substantial.<br>
If, for example, the base station 2, 21 or 50 is<br>
connected into the normal telephone system, a central<br>
controlling computer can monitor the operation of the<br>
device by the user remotely, and any anomalous or<br>
undesired administration can be detected rapidly and<br>
appropriate immediate action taken. A further<br>
advantage is that, for example, a sounder is easily<br>
incorporated into the base unit which can be<br>
programmed by the central computer to emit an audible<br>
signal, e.g. to remind a user that dosage is overdue.<br>
The operating rules may provide that if within say 5<br>
minutes of the emission of such an audible signal the<br>
user does not acknowledge having heard it, an<br>
appropriate record can be made of this event.<br>
As noted above, the device may itself include<br>
appropriate control circuitry including a memory<br>
device. In such a case, it is possible to programme<br>
that circuitry (and a remote computer) so that when<br>
the device is first docked, it starts by establishing<br>
a communication link with the remote computer, which<br>
can then initially set-up the device with appropriate<br>
parameters for a patient. These could, for example,<br>
govern the length of a PIN No required to access the<br>
docking station and details of the proposed dosage<br>
regime, for example initially loading an expected<br>
running average based on the prior doctor/patient<br>
experience. This false average could form the<br>
foundation for a continuing running average that is<br>
calculated with time and use. This data would<br>
constitute a benchmark, enabling the device thereafter<br>
to monitor usage levels and to detect any incidence of<br>
deviation. The time and frequency of use, and other<br>
events such as opening of the casing or tampering with<br><br>
it, may be stored and uploaded to a central system as<br>
desired. The system may be programmed to issue<br>
restrictive orders on the patient's medication, or it<br>
may simply be programmed to report data, so as to<br>
highlight areas of concern and alert the appropriate<br>
GP or specialist for attention at the patient's next<br>
appointment.<br>
As noted above with reference to Figures 6a/6b, in<br>
place of or supplementary to the downloading of data<br>
via a remote link, data may be stored with the<br>
container for the material to be dispensed. In some<br>
areas, there is already a requirement for a form of<br>
tagging on medicinal canisters that can be read or<br>
written to. This tag carries information as to the<br>
medication type, use-by dates, etc. and when used with<br>
a device according to the present invention, the tag<br>
may be accessed by the device (and/or via the docking<br>
station), and the device could be programmed to write<br>
to the tag the number of doses left in case of removal<br>
from the device. The tag could have a large memory<br>
capacity free for other uses. On return of the<br>
canister to the pharmacist, the usage data written to<br>
the canister can then be interrogated. Data as to<br>
when the canister was used and by whom, would remain<br>
with the canister of medication that was dispensed.<br>
This method of data management may prove to be more<br>
convenient and effective in some cases than online<br>
monitoring with the device (including the canister)<br>
being mated with the docking station.<br>
The device may be used to dispense medication at fixed<br>
times throughout the day. Alternatively, it can be<br>
programmed in a "free dosing" mode. This caters for<br>
the situation where a daily maximum dosage must be<br>
adhered to, but a specific time when the medication<br>
should be taken cannot be predefined, for example in<br><br>
the case of an analgesic type drug. The device<br>
itself, or the medicinal cannister can be programmed<br>
to set the free dosing mode, i.e. to allow the user to<br>
dose freely during a predefined period until a maximum<br>
allowable number of doses is reached.<br>
In certain circumstances, it may be desirable to<br>
programme the medicinal cannister to a free dosing<br>
mode, but to allow the device to override this mode,<br>
thereby allowing, for example, the free dosing mode to<br>
be manually overridden by a doctor from a remote<br>
location. The device or medicinal cannister can be<br>
programmed with different dispensing regimes for<br>
different days of the week, thereby varying the daily<br>
dosage.<br>
It can be seen that a wide variety of modifications<br>
may be made to the overall general construction and<br>
design described above, many of them easily made<br>
simply by changing computer programmes. Such changes<br>
could be made "online" when the hand-held unit is in<br>
the docking or base station and in communication with<br>
a host computer. The system is of particular value in<br>
the monitoring and analysis of administration during a<br>
controlled trial, enabling it to be highly automated<br>
and reliable. In particular, detection of activity<br>
outside the instructions or constraints of the trial<br>
can be immediately and automatically achieved.<br>
In addition to or instead of configuring the device<br>
remotely from the computer via a communication link,<br>
an alternative means configuration will now be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 7. This discloses a<br>
cartridge 100 designed to fit in a dispenser of Figs.<br>
6a and 6b. Similar arrangements using appropriately<br>
shaped cartridges may be employed with the examples of<br>
the previous figures. The lower half of the cartridge<br><br>
100 is shaped in the same way as the housing 60 so as<br>
to fit into the same socket in the dispenser. The<br>
upper part of the cartridge 100 may be shaped in any<br>
way, and in this case has an aperture 101 for ease of<br>
removal. The cartridge 100 contains no medication,<br>
but has a RF tag 102 sized and positioned similarly to<br>
RF tag 86. This tag 102 contains the patient specific<br>
information used to configure the device.<br>
If the cartridge 100 is configured for a particular<br>
device and is subsequently inserted into that device,<br>
only that device will be configured. If however the<br>
same cartridge is inserted into another device that<br>
the cartridge has not been configured for the<br>
cartridge will not authorise that dispense device. It<br>
will however cause the device that it was inserted<br>
into to log the serial number of the cartridge in its<br>
memory. When the unauthorised dispense device is next<br>
downloaded it will become apparent that the cartridge<br>
has been inserted into the device.<br>
If however a user has a number of dispense devices,<br>
say one in the home another in the car and a further<br>
device in the office, the cartridge 100 could be<br>
configured to authenticate and configure all devices<br>
upon insertion of the cartridge into the relevant<br>
device.<br>
When patients use the device they will have to enter<br>
their secure PIN code to access the drugs. On<br>
occasions the patient may forget the PIN code. In<br>
this event the user can insert the cartridge into the<br>
device which will replay the PIN by way of flashing<br>
the appropriate buttons and prompting the user to<br>
confirm by way of pressing the button indicated.<br>
In order to provide the ability to prevent the<br><br>
dispenser from dispensing when it is not an authorised<br>
location, a number of approaches may be adopted.<br>
Most simply, the dispensing unit 1 and base unit 2 of<br>
the example of Fig. 1 may be provided with an RF<br>
transmission mechanism. Signals received by the base<br>
unit 2 from the dispenser 1 are analysed by the<br>
control circuitry to determine whether or not the<br>
dispensing unit 1 is within an authorised radius of<br>
the docking station. If so, the control circuitry<br>
will release the locking mechanism. If not, the<br>
locking mechanism will remain in place. Similar<br>
considerations apply to the example of Figs. 6a and<br>
6b, where distance from the base station 50 can be<br>
monitored.<br>
The dispensing at an authorised location may be used<br>
in combination with other pre-programmed parameters<br>
referred to above, such as dosage patterns etc. A<br>
user will therefore only be able to access the drugs<br>
when at an authorised location and when it is time to<br>
dispense the dose in accordance with the other pre-<br>
programmed parameters.<br>
Alternatively, the location of a dispenser may be<br>
monitored using global positioning (GPS), cellular<br>
positioning (CPS) or a triangulation system.<br><br>
