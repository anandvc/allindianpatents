NUCLEIC ACID CONSTRUCTS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING ALTERED SEED OIL COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to recombinant nucleic acid molecules, constructs, and other agents associated with the coordinate manipulation of multiple genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. In particular, the agents of the present invention are associated with the simultaneous enhanced expression of certain genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway and suppressed expression of certain other genes in the same pathway. The present invention is also directed to plants incorporating such agents, and in particular to plants incorporating such constructs where the plants exhibit altered seed oil compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Plant oils are used in a variety of applications. Novel vegetable oil compositions and improved approaches to obtain oil compositions, from biosynthetic or natural plant sources, are needed. Depending upon the intended oil use, various different fatty acid compositions are desired. Plants, especially species which synthesize large amounts of oils in seeds, are an important source of oils both for edible and industrial uses. Seed oils are composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols in which fatty acids are esterified to the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.<br>
Soybean oil typically contains about 16-20% saturated fatty acids: 13-16% palmitate and 3-4% stearate. See generally Gunstone et al., The Lipid Handbook, Chapman &amp; Hall, London (1994). Soybean oils have been modified by various breeding methods to create benefits for specific markets. However, a soybean oil that is broadly beneficial to major soybean oil users such as consumers of salad oil, cooking oil and frying oil, and industrial markets such as biodiesel and biolube markets, is not available. Prior soybean oils were either too expensive or lacked an important food quality property such as oxidative stability, good fried food flavor or saturated fat content, or an important biodiesel property such as appropriate nitric oxide emissions or cold tolerance or cold flow.<br>
Higher plants synthesize fatty acids via a common metabolic pathway â€” the fatty acid synthetase (FAS) pathway, which is located in the plastids. (3-ketoacyl-ACP synthases are important rate-limiting enzymes in the FAS of plant cells and exist in several versions, p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I catalyzes chain elongation to palmitoyl-ACP (CI6:0), whereas 0-<br><br>
ketoacyl-ACP synthase II catalyzes chain elongation to stearoyl-ACP (CI8:0). P-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV is a variant of p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, and can also catalyze chain elongation to 18:0-ACP. In soybean, the major products of FAS are 16:0-ACPand 1S:0-ACP. The desaturation of 18:0-ACP to form 1S:1-ACP is catalyzed by a plastid-localized soluble delta-9 desaturase (also referred to as "stearoyl-ACP desaturase"). See Voelker et al., 52 Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 335-61 (2001).<br>
The products of the plastidial FAS and delta-9 desaturase, 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP, and 1S:1-ACP, are hydrolyzed by specific thioesterases (FAT). Plant thioesterases can be classified into two gene families based on sequence homology and substrate preference. The first family, FATA, includes long chain acyl-ACP thioesterases having activity primarily on 18:1-ACP. Enzymes of the second family, FATB, commonly utilize 16:0-ACP (palmitoyl-ACP), 18:0-ACP (stearoyl-ACP), and 18:1-ACP (oleoyl-ACP). Such thioesterases have an important role in determining chain length during de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plants, and thus these enzymes are useful in the provision of various modifications of fatty acyl compositions, particularly with respect to the relative proportions of various fatty acyl groups that are present in seed storage oils.<br>
The products of the FATA and FATB reactions, the free fatty acids, leave the plastids and are converted to their respective acyl-CoA esters. Acyl-CoAs are substrates for the lipid-biosynthesis pathway (Kennedy Pathway), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is responsible for membrane lipid formation as well as the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols, which constitute the seed oil. In the ER there are additional membrane-bound desaturases, which can further desaturate 18:1 to polyunsaturated fatty acids. A delta-12 desaturase (FAD2) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:1, forming linoleic acid (18:2). A delta-15 desaturase (FAD3) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:2, forming linolenic acid (18:3).<br>
Many complex biochemical pathways have now been manipulated genetically, usually by suppression or over-expression of single genes. Further exploitation of the potential for plant genetic manipulation will require the coordinate manipulation of multiple genes in a pathway. A number of approaches have been used to combine transgenes in one plant -including sexual crossing, retransformation, co-transformation, and the use of linked transgenes. A chimeric transgene with linked partial gene sequences can be used to<br><br>
coordinately suppress numerous plant endogenous genes. Constructs modeled on viral polyproteins can be used to simultaneously introduce multiple coding genes into plant cells. For a review, see Halpin et al, Plant Mol Biol. 47:295-310 (2001).<br>
Thus, a desired plant phenotype may require the expression of one or more genes and the concurrent reduction of expression of another gene or genes. Thus, there exists a need to simultaneously over-express one or more genes and suppress, or down-regulate, the expression of a another gene or genes in plants using a single transgenic construct.<br>

A cell or organism can have a family of more than one gene encoding a particular enzyme, and the capital letter that follows the gene terminology (A, B, C) is used to designate the family member, i.e., FAD2-1A is a different gene family member from FAD2-1B.<br>
As used herein, any range set forth is inclusive of the end points of the range unless otherwise stated.<br>
A.        Agents<br>
The agents of the invention will preferably be "biologically active" with respect to either a structural attribute, such as the capacity of a nucleic acid molecule to hybridize to another nucleic acid molecule, or the ability of a protein to be bound by an antibody (or to compete with another molecule for such binding). Alternatively, such an attribute may be catalytic and thus involve the capacity of the agent to mediate a chemical reaction or response. The agents will preferably be "substantially purified." The term "substantially purified," as<br><br>
used herein, refers to a molecule separated from substantially all other molecules normally associated with it in its native environmental conditions. More preferably a substantially purified molecule is the predominant species present in a preparation. A substantially purified molecule may be greater than 60% free, greater than 75% free, preferably greater than 90% free, and most preferably greater than 95% free from the other molecules (exclusive of solvent) present in the natural mixture. The term "substantially purified" is not intended to encompass molecules present in their native environmental conditions.<br>
The agents of the invention may also be recombinant. As used herein, the term "recombinant" means any agent (e.g., including but limited to DNA, peptide), that is, or results, however indirectly, from human manipulation of a nucleic acid molecule. It is also understood that the agents of the invention may be labeled with reagents that facilitate detection of the agent, e.g., fluorescent labels, chemical labels, and/or modified bases.<br>
Agents of the invention include nucleic acid molecules that comprise a DNA sequence which is at least 50%, 60%, or 70% identical over their entire length to a plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region. More preferable are DNA sequences that are, over their entire length, at least 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99% identical; or 100% identical to a plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region.<br>
"Identity," as is well understood in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more nucleic acid molecule sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, "identity" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. "Identity" can be readily calculated by known methods including, but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, ed., Oxford University Press, New York 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, ed., Academic Press, New York 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin and Griffin, eds., Humana Press, New Jersey 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, Academic Press 1987; Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov and Devereux, eds.,<br><br>
Stockton Press, New York 1991; and Carillo and Lipman, SIAM J. Applied Math, 4S.1073 1988.<br>
Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available programs. Computer programs which can be used to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG; a suite of five BLAST programs, three designed for nucleotide sequences queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and TBLASTX) and two designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN). The BLASTX program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources, e.g., BLAST Manual, Altschul et al, NCBINLM NTH, Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et al, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm can also be used to determine identity.<br>
Parameters for polypeptide sequence comparison typically include the following: Algorithm: Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453 (1970); Comparison matrix: BLOSSUM62 from Hentikoff and Hentikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-10919 (1992); Gap Penalty: 12; Gap Length Penalty: 4. A program that can be used with these parameters is publicly available as the "gap" program from Genetics Computer Group ("GCG"), Madison, Wisconsin. The above parameters along with no penalty for end gap are the default parameters for peptide comparisons.<br>
Parameters for nucleic acid molecule sequence comparison include the following: Algorithm: Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Bio. 48:443-453 (1970); Comparison matrix: matches - +10; mismatches = 0; Gap Penalty: 50; Gap Length Penalty: 3. As used herein, "% identity" is determined using the above parameters as the default parameters for nucleic acid molecule sequence comparisons and the "gap" program from GCG, version 10.2.<br>
Subsets of the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention include fragment nucleic acid molecules. "Fragment nucleic acid molecule" refers to a piece of a larger nucleic acid molecule, which may consist of significant portion(s) of, or indeed most of, the larger nucleic acid molecule, or which may comprise a smaller oligonucleotide having from about 15 to about 400 contiguous nucleotides and more preferably, about 15 to about 45 contiguous nucleotides, about 20 to about 45 contiguous nucleotides, about 15 to about 30 contiguous nucleotides, about 21 to about 30 contiguous nucleotides, about 21 to about 25 contiguous nucleotides, about 21 to about 24 contiguous nucleotides, about 19 to about 25 contiguous nucleotides, or<br><br>
about 21 contiguous nucleotides. Fragment nucleic acid molecules may consist of significant portion(s) of, or indeed most of, a plan: coding or non-coding region, or alternatively may comprise smaller oligonucleotides. In a preferred embodiment, a fragment shows 100% identity to the plant coding or non-codmg region. In another preferred embodiment, a fragment comprises a portion of a larger nucleic acid sequence. In another aspect, a fragment nucleic acid molecule has a nucleic acid sequence that has at least 15, 25. 50. or 100 contiguous nucleotides of a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule has a nucleic acid sequence that has at least 15, 25, 50, or 100 contiguous nucleotides of a plant coding or non-coding region.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the DNA sequence of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can comprise sequences that differ from those encoding a polypeptide or fragment of the protein due to conservative amino acid changes in the polypeptide; the nucleic acid sequences coding for the polypeptide can therefore have sequence differences corresponding to the conservative changes. In a further aspect of the present invention, one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention differ in nucleic acid sequence from those for which a specific sequence is provided herein because one or more codons have been replaced with a codon that encodes a conservative substitution of the amino acid originally encoded.<br>
Agents of the invention also include nucleic acid molecules that encode at least about a contiguous 10 amino acid region of a polypeptide of the present invention, more preferably at least about a contiguous 25, 40, 50, 100, or 125 amino acid region of a polypeptide of the present invention. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, different nucleotide codons may be used to code for a particular amino acid. A host cell often displays a preferred pattern of codon usage. Structural nucleic acid sequences are preferably constructed to utilize the codon usage pattern of the particular host cell. This generally enhances the expression of the structural nucleic acid sequence in a transformed host cell. Any of the above-described nucleic acid and amino acid sequences may be modified to reflect the preferred codon usage of a host cell or organism in which they are contained. Therefore, a contiguous 10 amino acid region of a polypeptide of the present invention could be encoded by numerous different nucleic acid sequences. Modification of a structural nucleic acid sequence for optimal codon usage in plants is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,639.052.<br><br>
Agents of the invention include nucleic acid molecules. For example, without limitation, in an aspect of the present invention, the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises an intron sequence of SEQ ID NO:  19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 32, 33, 34, or 35 or fragments thereof or complements thereof. In another aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence, which when introduced into a cell or organism, is capable of suppressing the production of an RNA or protein while simultaneously expressing, coexpressing or coordinately expressing another RNA or protein. In an aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence, which when introduced into a cell or organism is capable of suppressing, at least partially reducing, reducing, substantially reducing, or effectively eliminating the expression of endogenous FAD2, FAD3, and/or FATB RNA while at the same time coexpressing, simultaneously expressing, or coordinately expressing a beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV, delta-9 desaturase, and/or CP4 EPSPS RNA or protein.<br>
By decreasing the amount of FAD2 and/or FAD3 available in a plant cell, a decreased percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleate (C1S:2) and linolenate (C18:3) may be provided. Modifications in the pool of fatty acids available for incorporation into triacylglycerols may likewise affect the composition of oils in the plant cell. Thus, a decrease in expression of FAD2 and/or FAD3 may result in an increased proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (C18:1). When the amount of FATB is decreased in a plant cell, a decreased amount of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate and stearate may be provided. Thus, a decrease in expression of FATB may result in an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (18:1). The simultaneous suppression of FAD2, FAD3, and FATB expression thereby results in driving the FAS pathway toward an overall increase in mono-unsaturated fatty acids of 18-carbon length, such as oleate (CI8:1). See U.S. Patent No. 5,955,650.<br>
By increasing the amount of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS I) and/or beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV (KAS TV) available in a plant cell, a decreased percentage of 16:0-ACP may be provided, leading to an increased percentage of 18:0-ACP. A greater amount of 1S:0-ACP in combination with the simultaneous suppression of one or more of FAD2, FAD3, and FATB, thereby helps drive the oil composition toward an overall increase in oleate (CI 8:1). By increasing the amount of delta-9 desaturase available in a plant cell, an increased<br><br>
percentage of unsaturated fatty aeids may be provided, resulting in an overall lowering of stearate and total saturates.<br>
These combinations of increased and decreased enzyme expression may be manipulated to produce fatty acid compositions, including oils, having an increased oleate level, decreased linoleate. linolenate. siearatc. and/or palmitate levels, and a decreased overall level of saturates. Enhancement of gene expression in plants may occur through the introduction of extra copies of coding sequences of the genes into the plant cell or, preferably, the incorporation of extra copies of coding sequences of the gene into the plant genome. Over-expression may also occur though increasing the activities of the regulatory mechanisms that regulate the expression of genes, i.e., up-regulation of the gene expression.<br>
Production of CP4 EPSPS in a plant cell provides the plant cell with resistance or tolerance to glyphosate, thereby providing a convenient method for identification of successful transformants via glyphosate-tolerant selection.<br>
Suppression of gene expression in plants, also known as gene silencing, occurs at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level. There are various methods for the suppression of expression of endogenous sequences in a host cell, including, but not limited to, antisense suppression, co-suppression, ribozymes, combinations of sense and antisense (double-stranded RNAi), promoter silencing, and DNA binding proteins such as zinc finger proteins. (See, e.g., WO 98/53083 and WO 01/1453S). Certain of these mechanisms are associated with nucleic acid homology at the DNA or RNA level. In plants, double-stranded RNA molecules can induce sequence-specific silencing. Gene silencing is often referred to as double stranded RNA ("dsRNAi") in plants, as RNA interference or RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans and in animals, and as quelling in fungi.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises (a) a first set of DNA sequences, each of which exhibits sufficient homology to one or more coding or non-coding sequences of a plant gene such that when it is expressed, it is capable of effectively eliminating, substantially reducing, or at least partially reducing the level of an mRNA transcript or protein encoded by the gene from which the coding or non-coding sequence was derived, or any gene which has homology to the target non-coding sequence, and (b) a second set of DNA sequences, each of which exhibits sufficient homology to a plant gene<br><br>
so that when it is expressed, it is capable of at least partially enhancing, increasing, enhancing. or substantially enhancing the level of an niRNA transcript or protein encoded by the gene.<br>
As used herein, "a reduction"" of the level or amount of an agent such as a protein or mRNA means that the lcvei or amour/. ;s reduced relative to a ce": or organism lacking a D.\A sequence capable of reducing die ager.;.  For example, "at least a partial reduction"" refers to a reduction of at leas; 25%. "a substantial reduction" refers to a reduction of at least 75%, and "an effective elimination" refers to a reduction of greater than 95%. all of which reductions in the level or amount of the agent are relative to a cell or organism "lacking a DNA sequence capable of reducing the agent.<br>
As used herein, "an enhanced"" or "increased" level or amount of an agent such as a protein or mRNA means that the level or amount is higher than the level or amount of agent present in a cell, tissue or plant with a similar genetic background but lacking an introduced nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein or mRNA. For example, an "at least partially enhanced"7 level refers to an increase of at least 25%, and a "substantially enhanced" level refers to an increase of at least 100%. all of which increases in the level or amount of an agent are relative to the level or amount of agent that is present in a cell, tissue or plant with a similar genetic background but lacking an introduced nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein or mRNA.<br>
When levels of an agent are compared, such a comparison is preferably carried out between organisms with a similar genetic background. Preferably, a similar genetic background is a background where the organisms being compared share 50% or greater, more preferably 75% or greater, and, even more preferably 90% or greater sequence identity of nuclear genetic material. In another preferred aspect, a similar genetic background is a background where the organisms being compared are plants, and the plants are isogenic except for any genetic material originally introduced using plant transformation techniques. Measurement of the level or amount of an agent may be carried out by any suitable method, non-limiting examples of which include comparison of mRNA transcript levels, protein or peptide levels, and'or phenotype, especially oil content. As used herein; mRNA transcripts include processed and non-processed mRNA transcripts, and proteins or peptides include proteins or peptides with or without any post-translational modification.<br><br>
The DNA sequences of the first set of DNA sequences may be coding sequences, intron sequences. 3'UTR sequences, 5'UTR sequences, promoter sequences, other non-coding sequences, or any combination of the foregoing. The first set of DNA sequences encodes one or more sequences which, when expressed, are capable of selectively reducing either or both the protein and the transcript encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2. FADS, and FATB. In a preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences is capable of expressing antisense RNA, in which the individual antisense sequences may be linked in one transcript, or may be in unlinked individual transcripts. In a further preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences are physically linked sequences which are capable of expressing a single dsRNA molecule. In a different preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences is capable of expressing sense cosuppresion RNA, in which the individual sense sequences may be linked in one transcript, or may be in unlinked individual transcripts. Exemplary embodiments of the first set of DNA sequences are described in Part B of the Detailed Description, and in the Examples.<br>
The second set of DNA sequences encodes one or more sequences which, when expressed, are capable of increasing one or both of the protein and transcript encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS /), beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV {KASB% delta-9 desaturase, and CP4 EPSPS. The DNA sequences of the second set of DNA sequences may be physically linked sequences. Exemplary embodiments of the second set of DNA sequences are described below in Parts C and D of the Detailed Description.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides methods for altering the composition of fatty acids<br>
and compounds containing such fatty acids, such as oils, waxes, and fats. The present<br>
invention also provides methods for the production of particular fatty acids in host cell plants.<br>
Such methods employ the use of the expression cassettes described herein for the modification<br>
of the host plant cell' s FAS pathway.<br>

For example the levels of products may be increased or decreased in one or more of the tissues and organs of a plant including without limitation: roots, tubers, stems, leaves, stalks, fruit, berries, nuts, bark, pods, seeds and flowers. A preferred organ is a seed. For example, exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a plant cell and the plant cell regenerated into a whole, fertile or sterile plant or plant part.<br>
"Exogenous genetic material" is any genetic material, whether naturally occurring or otherwise, from any source that is capable of being inserted into any organism. Such<br><br>
exogenous genetic material includes, without limitation, nucleic acid molecules and constructs of the present invention. Exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a host cell by the use of a DNA vector or construct designed for such a purpose. Design of such a vector is generally within the skill of the art (See, e.g.. Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratoiy Manual, Clark (ed.). Springer, New York (1997)).<br>
A construct or vector may include a promoter functional in a plant cell, or a plant promoter, to express a nucleic acid molecule of choice. A number of promoters that are active in plant cells have been described in the literature, and the CaMV 35S and FMV promoters are preferred for use in plants. Preferred promoters are enhanced or duplicated versions of the CaMV 35S and FMV 35S promoters. Odell et al, Nature 313: 810-812 (1985); U.S. Patent No. 5,378,619. Additional promoters that may be utilized are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,37S,619; 5,391,725; 5,428,147; 5,447,858; 5,608,144; 5,608,144; 5,614,399; 5,633,441; 5,633,435; and 4,633,436.

Particularly preferred promoters can also be used to express a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention in seeds or fruits. Indeed, in a preferred embodiment, the promoter used is a seed specific promoter. Examples of such promoters include the 5' regulatory regions from such genes as napin (Kridl et al, Seed Set Res. 1:209-219 (1991)), phaseolin, stearoyl-ACP desaturase, 7Sa, 7sa' (Chen et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., 83:8560-8564 (1986)), USP, arcelin and oleosin. Preferred promoters for expression in the seed are 7Sa, 7sa', napin, and FAD2-1A promoters.<br>

The sequences may include coding sequences, intron sequences, 3'UTR sequences, 5'UTR sequences, other non-coding sequences, or any combination of the foregoing. The first set of DNA sequences may be expressed in any suitable form, including as a dsRNA construct, a sense cosuppression construct, or as an antisense construct.

The first set of DNA sequences depicted in FIG. 1 comprises three non-coding sequences, each of which expresses an RNA sequence (not shown) that exhibits identity to a non-coding region of a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FADS, and FATB genes. The non-coding sequences each express an RNA sequence that exhibits at least 90% identity to a non-coding region of a gene selected from the group consisting ofFAD2, FADS, and FATB genes.

G.	Oil Compositions<br>
For many oil applications, saturated fatty acid levels are preferably less than 8% by weight, and more preferably about 2-3 % by weight. Saturated fatty acids have high melting points which are undesirable in many applications. When used as a feedstock for fuel, saturated fatty acids cause clouding at low temperatures, and confer poor cold flow properties such as pour points and cold filter plugging points to the fuel. Oil products containing low saturated fatty acid levels may be preferred by consumers and the food industry because they are perceived as healthier and/or may be labeled as "saturated fat free" in accordance with FDA guidelines. In addition, low saturate oils reduce or eliminate the need to winterize the oil for food applications such as salad oils. In biodiesel and lubricant applications oils with low<br><br>
saturated fatty acid levels confer improved cold flow properties and do not cloud at low temperatures.<br>
The factors governing the physical properties of a particular oil are complex. Palmitic, stearic and other saturated fatty acids are typically solid at room temperature, in contrast to the unsaturated fatty acids, which remain liquid. Because saturated fatty acids have no double bonds in the acyl chain, they remain stable to oxidation at elevated temperatures. Saturated fatly acids are important components in margarines and chocolate formulations, but for many food applications, reduced levels of saturated fatty acids are desired.<br>
Oleic acid has one double bond, but is still relatively stable at high temperatures, and oils with high levels of oleic acid are suitable for cooking and other processes where heating is required. Recently, increased consumption of high oleic oils has been recommended, because oleic acid appears to lower blood levels of low density lipoproteins ("LDLs") without affecting levels of high density lipoproteins ("HDLs"). However, some limitation of oleic acid levels is desirable, because when oleic acid is degraded at high temperatures, it creates negative flavor compounds and diminishes the positive flavors created by the oxidation of linoleic acid. Neff eta!.,JAOCS, 77 :1303-1313 (2000); Warner et al., J. Agric. FoodChem. 49:899-905 (2001). Preferred oils have oleic acid levels that are 65-85% or less by weight, in order to limit off-flavors in food applications such as frying oil and fried food. Other preferred oils have oleic acid levels that are greater than 55% by weight in order to improve oxidative stability.<br>
Linoleic acid is a major polyunsaturated fatty acid in foods and is an essential nutrient for humans. It is a desirable component for many food applications because it is a major precursor of fried food flavor substances such as 2,4 decadienal, which make fried foods taste good. However, linoleic acid has limited stability when heated. Preferred food oils have linoleic acid levels that are 10% or greater by weight, to enhance the formation of desirable fried food flavor substances, and also are 25% or less by weight, so that the formation of off-flavors is reduced. Linoleic acid also has cholesterol-lowering properties, although dietary excess can reduce the ability of human cells to protect themselves from oxidative damage, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Toborek et al., Am J. Clin. J. 75:119-125 (2002). See generally Flavor Chemistry of Lipid Foods, editors D.B. Min &amp; T.H. Smouse, Am Oil Chem. Soc, Champaign, EL (1989).<br><br>
Linoleic acid, having a lower melting point than oleic acid, further contributes to improved cold flow properties desirable in biodiesel and biolubricant applications. Preferred oils for most applications have linoleic acid levels of 30% or less by weight, because the oxidation of linoleic acid limits the useful storage or use-time of frying oil, food, feed, fuel and lubricant products. See generally, Physical Properties of Fats, Oils, and Etmdsifiers, ed. N. Widlak, AOCS Press (1999); Erhan &amp; Asadauskas, Lubricant Basestocks from Vegetable Oils, Industrial Crops and Products, 11:277-282 (2000). In addition, high linoleic acid levels in cattle feed can lead to undesirably high levels of linoleic acid in the milk of dairy cattle, and therefore poor oxidative stability and flavor. Timmons et ah, J. Dairy Sci. 84:2440-2449 (2001). A broadly useful oil composition has linoleic acid levels of 10-25% by weight.<br>
Linolenic acid is also an important component of the human diet. It is used to synthesize the co-3 family of long-chain fatty acids and the prostaglandins derived therefrom. However, its double bonds are highly susceptible to oxidation, so that oils with high levels of linolenic acid deteriorate rapidly on exposure to air, especially at high temperatures. Partial hydrogenation of such oils is often necessary before they can be used in food products to retard the formation of off-flavors and rancidity when the oil is heated, but hydrogenation creates unhealthy trans fatty acids which can contribute to cardiovascular disease. To achieve improved oxidative stability, and reduce the need to hydrogenate oil, preferred oils have linolenic acid levels that are 8% or less by weight, 6% or less, 4% or less, and more preferably 0.5-2% by weight of the total fatty acids in the oil of the present invention.<br>
The oil of the present invention can be a blended oil, synthesized oil or in a preferred embodiment an oil generated from an oilseed having an appropriate oil composition. In a preferred embodiment, the oil is a soybean oil. The oil can be a crude oil such as crude soybean oil, or can be a processed oil, for example the oil can be refined, bleached, deodorized, and/or winterized. As used herein, "refining" refers to a process of treating natural or processed fat or oil to remove impurities, and may be accomplished by treating fat or oil with caustic soda, followed by centrifugation, washing with water, and heating under vacuum. "Bleaching" refers to a process of treating a fat or oil to remove or reduce the levels of coloring materials in the fat or oil. Bleaching may be accomplished by treating fat or oil with activated charcoal or Fullers (diatomaceous) earth. "Deodorizing" refers to a process of removing components from a fat or oil that contribute objectionable flavors or odors to the end product,<br><br>
and may be accomplished by use of high vacuum and superheated steam washing. "Winterizing" refers to a process of removing saturated glycerides from an oil, and may be accomplished by chilling and removal of solidified portions of fat from an oil.<br>
A preferred oil of the present invention has a low saturate oil composition, or a zero saturate oil composition. In other preferred embodiments, oils of the present invention have increased oleic acid levels, reduced saturated fatty levels, and reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. In a preferred embodiment, the oil is a soybean oil. The percentages of fatty acid content, or fatty acid levels, used herein refer to percentages by weight.<br>
In a first embodiment, an oil of the present invention preferably has an oil composition that is 55 to 80% oleic acid, 10 to 40% linoleic acid, 6% or less linolenic acid, and 2 to 8% saturated fatty acids; more preferably has an oil composition that is 55 to S0% oleic acid, 10 to 39% linoleic acid, 4.5% or less linolenic acid, and 3 to 6% saturated fatty acids; and even more preferably has an oil composition that is 55 to 80% oleic acid, 10 to 39% linoleic acid, 3.0% or less linolenic acid, and 2 to 3.6% saturated fatty acids.<br>
In a second embodiment, an oil of the present invention preferably has an oil composition that is 65 to 80% oleic acid, 10 to 30% linoleic acid, 6% or less linolenic acid, and 2 to 8% saturated fatty acids; more preferably has an oil composition that is 65 to 80% oleic acid, 10 to 29% linoleic acid, 4.5% or less linolenic acid, and 3 to 6% saturated fatty acids; and even more preferably has an oil composition that is 65 to 80% oleic acid, 10 to 29% linoleic acid, 3.0% or less linolenic acid, and 2 to 3.6% saturated fatty acids.<br>
In other embodiments, the percentage of oleic acid is 50% or greater, 55% or greater; 60% or greater; 65% or greater, 70% or greater; 75% or greater; or 80% or greater, or is a range from 50 to 80%; 55 to 80%; 55 to 75%; 55 to 65%; 65 to 80%; 65 to 75%; 65 to 70%; or 69 to 73%. Suitable percentage ranges for oleic acid content in oils of the present invention also include ranges in which the lower limit is selected from the following percentages: 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 61, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80 percent; and the upper limit is selected from the following percentages: 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, S7, 88, 89, or 90 percent.<br>
In these other embodiments, the percentage of linoleic acid in an oil of the present invention is a range from 10 to 40%; 10 to 39%; 10 to 30%; 10 to 29%; 10 to 28%; 10 to 25%;<br><br>
10 to 21%; 10 to 20%; 11 to 30%; 12 to 30%; 15 to 25%; 20 to 25%; 20 to 30%; or 21 to 24%. Suitable percentage ranges for linoleic acid content in oils of the present invention also include ranges in which the lower limit is selected from the following percentages: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, IS, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 percent; and the upper limit is selected from the following percentages: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 percent.<br>
In these other embodiments, the percentage of linolenic acid in an oil of the present invention is 10% or less; 9% or less; 8% or less; 7% or less; 6% or less; 5% or less; 4.5% or less; 4% or less; 3.5% or less; 3% or less; 3.0% or less; 2.5% or less; or 2% or less; or is a range from 0.5 to 2%; 0.5 to 3%; 0.5 to 4.5%; 0.5% to 6%; 3 to 5%; 3 to 6%; 3 to 8%; 1 to 2%; 1 to 3%; or 1 to 4%. In these other embodiments, the percentage of saturated fatty acids in an oil composition of the present invention is 15% or less; 14% or less; 13% or less; 12% or less, 11% or less; 10% or less; 9% or less; 8% or less; 7% or less; 6% or less; 5% or less; 4% or less; or 3.6% or less; or is a range from 2 to 3%; 2 to 3.6%; 2 to 4%; 2 to 8%; 3 to 15%; 3 to 10%; 3 to 8%; 3 to 6%; 3.6 to 7%; 5 to 8%; 7 to 10%; or 10 to 15%.<br>
An oil of the present invention is particularly suited to use as a cooking or frying oil. Because of its reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid content, the oil of the present invention does not require the extensive processing of typical oils because fewer objectionable odorous and colorant compounds are present. In addition, the low saturated fatty acid content of the present oil improves the cold flow properties of the oil, and obviates the need to heat stored oil to prevent it from crystallizing or solidifying. Improved cold flow also enhances drainage of oil from fried food material once it has been removed from frying oil, thereby resulting in a lower fat product See Bouchon et at, J. Food Science 66: 918-923 (2001). The low levels of linolenic acid in the present oil are particularly advantageous in frying to reduce off-flavors.<br>
The present oil is also well-suited for use as a salad oil (an oil that maintains clarity at refrigerator temperatures of 40-50 degrees Fahrenheit). Its improved clarity at refrigerator temperatures, due to its low saturated fatty acid and moderate linoleic acid content, reduces or eliminates the need to winterize the oil before use as a salad oil.<br>
In addition, the moderate linoleic and low linolenic acid content of the present oil make it well-suited for the production of shortening, margarine and other semi-solid vegetable fats used in foodstuffs. Production of these fats typically involves hydrogenation of unsaturated<br><br>
oils such as soybean oil. corn oil, or canola oil. The increased oxidative and flavor stability of the present oil mean that it need not be hydrogenated to the extent that typical vegetable oil is for uses such as margarine and shortening, thereby reducing processing costs and the production of unhealthy i reins isomers.<br>
An oil of the present invention is also suitable tor use as a feedstock' to produce biodiesel. particularly because biodiesel made from such an oil has improved cold flow, improved ignition quality (cetane number), improved oxidative stability, and reduced nitric oxide emissions. Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel typically comprised of methyl esters of samrated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated C16-C2: fatty acids. Cetane number is a measure of ignition quality - the shorter the ignition delay time of fuel in the engine, the higher the cetane number. The ASTM standard specification for biodiesel fuel (D 6751-02) requires a minimum cetane number of 47.<br>
The use of biodiesel in conventional diesel engines results in substantial reductions of pollutants such as sulfates, carbon monoxide, and particulates compared to petroleum diesel fuel, and use in school buses can greatly reduce children's exposure to toxic diesel exhaust. A limitation to the use of 100% conventional biodiesel as fuel is the high cloud point of conventional soy biodiesel (2 degrees C) compared to number 2 diesel (-16 degrees C). Dunn et ai. Recent. Res. Devel. in Oil Chem., 1:31-56 (1997). Biodiesel made from oil of the present invention has an improved (reduced) cloud point and cold filter plugging point, and may also be used in blends to improve the cold-temperature properties of biodiesel made from inexpensive but highly saturated sources of fat such as animal fats (tallow, lard, chicken fat) and palm oil. Biodiesel can also be blended with petroleum diesel at any level.<br>
Biodiesel is typically obtained by extracting, filtering and refining soybean oil to remove free fats and phospholipids, and then transesterifying the oil with methanol to form methyl esters of the fatty acids. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,891,203. The resultant soy methyl esters are commonly referred to as "biodiesel." The oil of the present invention may also be used as a diesel fuel without the formation of methyl esters, such as, for example, by mixing acetals with the oil. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,013,114. Due to its improved cold flow and oxidative stability properties, the oil of the present invention is also useful as a lubricant, and as a diesel fuel additive. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,888,947, 5,454.842 and 4,557,734.<br><br>
Soybeans, and oils of the present invention are also suitable for use in a variety of soyfoods made from whole soybeans, such as soymilk, soy nut butter, natto, and tempeh, and soyfoods made from processed soybeans and soybean oil, including soybean meal, soy flour, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolates, texturized soy protein concentrate, hydrolyzed soy-protein, whipped topping, cooking oil, salad oil, shortening, and lecithin. Whole soybeans are also edible, and are typically sold to consumers raw, roasted, or as edamame. Soymilk. which is typically produced by soaking and grinding whole soybeans, may be consumed as is, spray-dried, or processed to form soy yogurt, soy cheese, tofu, or yuba. The present soybean or oil may be advantageously used in these and other soyfoods because of its improved oxidative stability, the reduction of off-flavor precursors, and its low saturated fatty acid level.<br>

1C.       FatB Constructs<br>
The soybean FATB intron II sequence (SEQ ID NO: 30) is amplified via PCR using a FATB partial genomic clone as a template. PCR amplification is carried out as follows: 1 cycle, 95Â°C for 10 min; 25 cycles, 95Â°C for 30 sec, 62Â°C for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 30 sec; 1 cycle, 72Â°C for 7 min. PCR amplification results in a product that is 854 bp long, including reengineered restriction sites at both ends. The PCR product is cloned directly into the expression cassette pCGN3892 in sense orientation, by way of Xliol sites engineered onto the 5' ends of the PCR primers, to form pMON70674. Vector pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. pMON70674 is then cut with Notl and ligated into pMON41164, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting gene expression construct, pMON70678, is used for transformation of soybean using Agrobacterium methods.<br>
Two other expression constructs containing the soybean FATB intron II sequence (SEQ ID NO: 30) are created. pMON70674 is cut with Notl and ligated into pMON70675 which contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter and the KASIVgene regulated by the napin promoter, resulting in pMON70680. The expression vector pMON70680 is then cut with SnaBl and ligated with a gene fusion of the jojoba delta-9 desaturase gene (SEQ ID NO: 41) in sense orientation regulated by the 7S promoter. The expression constructs pMON70680 and pMON70681 are used for transformation of soybean using Agrobacterium methods.<br><br>
Expression constructs are made containing various permutations of a first set of DNA sequences. The first set of DNA sequences are any of those described, or illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, or any other set of DNA sequences that contain either various combinations of sense and antisense FAD2, FADS, and FATE non-coding regions so that they arc capable of forming dsRNA constructs, sense cosuppression constructs, antisense constructs, or various combinations of the foregoing.<br>
FIGS. 5(a)-(c) depict several first sets of DNA sequences which are capable of expressing sense cosuppression or antisense constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Tables 1 and 2 below. The non-coding sequences may be single sequences, combinations of sequences (e.g., the 5'UTR linked to the 3'UTR), or any combination of the foregoing. To express a sense cosuppression construct, all of the non-coding sequences are sense sequences, and to express an antisense construct, all of the non-coding sequences are antisense sequences. FIG. 5(d) depicts a first set of DNA sequences which is capable of expressing sense and antisense constructs according to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 6(a)-(c) depict several first sets of DNA sequences which are capable of expressing dsRNA constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Tables 1 and 2 below. The first set of DNA sequences depicted in FIG. 6 comprises pairs of related sense and antisense sequences, arranged such that, e.g., the RNA expressed by the first sense sequence is capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with the antisense RNA expressed by the first antisense sequence. For example, referring to FIG. 6(a) and illustrative combination No. 1 (of Table 1), the first set of DNA sequences comprises a sense FAD2-1 sequence, a sense FAD3-1 sequence, an antisense FAD2-1 sequence and an antisense FAD3-J sequence. Both antisense sequences correspond to the sense sequences so that the expression products of the first set of DNA sequences are capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with each other. The sense sequences may be separated from the antisense sequences by a spacer sequence, preferably one that promotes the formation of a dsRNA molecule. Examples of such spacer sequences include those set forth in Wesley et al, supra, and Hamilton et al, Plant J., 15:737-746 (1988). The promoter is any promoter functional in a<br><br>
plant, or any plant promoter. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoters are described in Part D of the Detailed Description.<br>
The first set of DNA sequences is inserted in an expression construct in either the sense or anti-sense orientation using a variety of DNA manipulation techniques.   If convenient restriction sites are present in the DNA sequences, they are inserted into the expression construct by digesting with the restriction endonucleases and ligation into the construct that has been digested at one or more of the available cloning sites. If convenient restriction sites are not available in the DNA sequences, the DNA of either the construct or the DNA sequences is modified in a variety of ways to facilitate cloning of the DNA sequences into the construct. Examples of methods to modify the DNA include by PCR, synthetic linker or adapter ligation, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, filling in or cutting back of overhanging 5' or 3' ends, and the like. These and other methods of manipulating DNA are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br><br><br>

Each coding sequence is associated with a promoter, which can be any promoter functional in a plant, or any plant promoter, and may be an FMV promoter, a napin promoter, a 7S (either 7Sa or 7Sa') promoter, an arcelin promoter, a delta-9 desaturase promoter, or a FAD2-1A promoter.<br>

Example 3        Plant Transformation and Analysis<br>
The constructs of Examples 1 and 2 are stably introduced into soybean (for example, Asgrow variety A4922 or Asgrow variety A3244 or Asgrow variety A3525) by the methods described earlier, including the methods of McCabe et ai, Bio/Technology, 6:923-926 (1988),<br><br>
or Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transformed soybean plants are identified by selection on media containing glyphosate. Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs using gas chromatography. In addition, any of the constructs may contain other sequences of interest, as well as different combinations of promoters.<br>
For some applications, modified fatty acid compositions are detected in developing seeds, whereas in other instances, such as for analysis of oil profile, detection of fatty acid modifications occurring later in the FAS pathway, or for detection of minor modifications to the fatty acid composition, analysis of fatty acid or oil from mature seeds is preferred. Furthermore, analysis of oil and/or fatty acid content of individual seeds may be desirable, especially in detection of oil modification in the segregating Rl seed populations. As used herein, RO indicates the plant and seed arising from transformation/regeneration protocols described herein, and Rl indicates plants and seeds generated from the transgenic RO seed.<br>
Fatty acid compositions are determined for the seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs of Example 2. One to ten seeds of each of the transgenic and control soybean lines are ground individually using a tissue homogenizer (Pro Scientific) for oil extraction. Oil from ground soybean seed is extracted overnight in 1.5 ml heptane containing triheptadecanoin (0.50 mg/ml). Aliquots of 200 pi of the extracted oil are derivatized to methyl esters with the addition of 500 ul sodium methoxide in absolute methanol. The derivatization reaction is allowed to progress for 20 minutes at 50Â°C. The reaction is stopped by the simultaneous addition of 500 ul 10% (w/v) sodium chloride and 400 ul heptane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters extracted in hexane are resolved by gas chromatography (GC) on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 GC (Palo Alto, CA). The GC was fitted with a Supelcowax 250 column (30 m, 0.25 mm id, 0.25 micron film thickness) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Column temperature is 175Â°C at injection and the temperature programmed from 175Â°C to 245Â°C to 175Â°C at 40Â°C/min. Injector and detector temperatures are 250C and 270Â°C, respectively.<br>
Example 4        Synthesized Fuel Oil with Improved Biodiesel Properties<br>
A synthesized fuel oil fatty acid composition is prepared having the following mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters: 73.3% oleic acid, 21.4% linoleic acid, 2.2% palmitic acid, 2.1% linolenic acid and 1.0% stearic acid (all by weight). Purified fatty acid methyl esters are<br><br>
obtained from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN, USA. The cetane number and ignition delay of this composition is determined by the Southwest Research Institute using an Ignition Quality Tester ("IQT") 613 (Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, USA).<br>
An IQT consists of a constant volume combustion chamber that is electrically heated, a fuel injection system, and a computer that is used to control the experiment, record the data and provide interpretation of the data. The fuel injection system includes a fuel injector nozzle that forms an entrance to the combustion chamber. A needle lift sensor in the fuel injector nozzle detects fuel flow into the combustion chamber. A pressure transducer attached to the combustion chamber measures cylinder pressure, the pressure within the combustion chamber. The basic concept of an IQT is measurement of the time from the start of fuel injection into the combustion chamber to the start of combustion. The thermodynamic conditions in the combustion chamber are precisely controlled to provide consistent measurement of the ignition delay time.<br>
For a cetane number and ignition delay test, the test fuel is filtered using a 5-micron filter. The fuel reservoir, injection line, and nozzle are purged with pressurized nitrogen. The fuel reservoir is then cleaned with a lint free cloth. A portion of the test fuel is used to flush the fuel reservoir, injection line, and nozzle. The reservoir is filled with the test fuel and all air is bled from the system. The reservoir is pressurized to 50 psig. The method basically consists of injecting at high pressure a precisely metered quantity of the test fuel into the combustion chamber that is charged with air to the desired pressure and temperature. The measurement consists of determining the time from the start of injection to the onset of combustion, often referred to as the ignition delay time. This determination is based on the measured needle lift and combustion chamber pressures. The normal cetane rating procedure calls for setting the skin temperature at 567.5Â°C. and the air pressure at 2.1 MPa,<br>
A fuel with a known injection delay is run in the IQT combustion bomb at the beginning of the day to make sure the unit is operating within normal parameters. The test synthetic is then run. The known fuel is run again to verify that the system has not changed. Once the fuel reservoir is reconnected to the fuel injection pump, the test procedure is initiated on the PC controller. The computer controls all the procedure, including the air charging, fuel injection, and exhaust events. 32 repeat combustion events are undertaken.<br><br>
The ignition delay is the time from the start of injection to the start of ignition. It is determined from the needle lift and cylinder pressure data. The rise of the injection needle signals start of injection. The cylinder pressure drops slightly due to the cooling effect of the vaporization of the fuel. Start of combustion is defined as the recovery time of the cylinder pressure - increases due to combustion to the pressure it was just prior to fuel injection.<br>
The measured ignition delay times are then used to determine the cetane number based on a calibration curve that is incorporated into the data acquisition and reduction software. The calibration curve, consisting of cetane number as a function of ignition delay time, is generated using blends of the primary reference fuels and NEG check fuels. In the case of test fuels that are liquid at ambient conditions, the calibration curve is checked on a daily basis using at least one check fuel of known cetane number (Ryan, "Correlation of Physical and Chemical Ignition Delay to Cetane Number", SAE Paper 852103 (1985); Ryan, "Diesel Fuel Ignition Quality as Determined in a Constant Volume Combustion Bomb", SAE Paper 870586 (1986); Ryan, "Development of a Portable Fuel Cetane Quality Monitor", Belvoir Fuels and Lubricants Research Facility Report No. 277, May (1992); Ryan, "Engine and Constant Volume Bomb Studies of Diesel Ignition and Combustion", SAE Paper 881616 (1988); and Allard et ah, "Diesel Fuel Ignition Quality as Determined in the Ignition Quality Tester ("IQT")", SAE Paper 961182 (1996)). As shown in Table 3, the synthesized oil composition exhibits cetane numbers and ignition delays that are suitable for use for example, without limitation, as a biodiesel oil.<br><br><br>
The density (ASTM D-4052) cloud point (ASTM D-2500), pour point (ASTM D-97), and cold filter plugging point (EP 309/ASTM D-6371) are determined for the synthesized oil using ASTM D protocols. ASTM D protocols are obtained from ASTM. 100 Barr Harbor Drive. West Conshohocken, PA. USA. The results of these tests are set forth in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the synthesized oil composition exhibits numbers that are suitable for use as, for example without limitation, as a biodiesel oil.<br><br>
Levels of nitric oxide emissions are estimated by evaluating the unsaturation levels of a biologically-based fuel, by measuring the fuel density and indirectly calculating the estimated emissions levels, or by directly measuring . There are also standard protocols available for directly measuring levels of nitric oxide emissions. The synthesized oil is estimated to have lower nitric oxide emissions levels than methyl esters of fatty acids made from conventional soybean oil based on an evaluation of the overall level of unsaturation in the synthesized oil. Oils containing larger numbers of double bonds, i.e., having a higher degree of unsaturation, tend to produce higher nitric oxide emissions. The oil has a total of 123 double bonds, as compared to conventional soybean oil's total of 153 double bonds, as shown in Table 5.<br><br>
