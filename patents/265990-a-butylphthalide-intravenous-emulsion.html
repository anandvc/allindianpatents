				<td>BUTYLPHTHALIDE INTRAVENOUS EMULSION AND APPLICATION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a butylphthalide preparation, and specifically to a butylphthalide intravenous emulsion and application thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
dl-3-n-Butylphthalide	(NBP)	also	called	butylphthalide	is<br>
dl-3-butylisobenzofuran-l(3H)-one, which is a raceme. 1-3-n-Butylphthalid is extracted from celery seeds. NBP acts on multiple steps of cerebral ischemia procedure, such as reducing infarct area after focal cerebral ischemia, increasing cerebral blood flow in ischemic area and improving microcirculation in cerebral ischemic area, protecting mitochondrial function, alleviating damage to nerve function, and improving cerebral energy metabolism after total cerebral ischemia. Chinese Patent Nos. 98125618.X, 03137457.3, 200310100222.2 and 200410001748.X respectively disclose the applications of butylphthalide in anti-thrombus and anti-platelet aggregation, the application of 1-n-butylphthalide in prevention and treatment of dementia, cerebral infarction and in manufacture of medicaments for treatment of cerebral ischemia.<br>
Currently butylphthalide preparations available in market are only soft capsules. Since butylphthalide is of an oily liquid form, it can be dissolved in an oil phase or directly processed to form an emulsion, then can be packaged in hard capsules or soft capsules, or can be orally administered directly. However, butylphthalide has a relatively apparent first pass effect which leads to a relatively low bioavailability. In addition, cerebral ischemia patients usually are companied with dysphagia or coma, so that capsules cannot meet the clinical requirements for these patients. For cerebral ischemia patients, time is life. Therefore, it is vital to develop a new delivery system suitable for clinical application.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since butylphthalide is an oily liquid and hardly dissoluble in water, a specific manufacture technology is employed in the present invention to process butylphthalide into an emulsion for intravenous administration. The butylphthalide intravenous emulsion of the present invention has the following advantages: the drug directly enters into systemic circulation, thus resulting in quick action; the solubility of butylphthalide is improved, resulting in a reduced dosage; and/or the targeting of butylphthalide to brain tissue is improved, thus reducing its toxic side-effects.<br>
The emulsion of the present invention has a particle size of between 10 and 2000 nm, and may be administered via intravenous injection or infusion in order to achieve quick action and brain targeting effect.<br>
The butylphthalide intravenous emulsion of the present invention comprises butylphthalide or derivatives thereof as an active ingredient in an amount of 0.01~50wt%, preferably 0.01~20wt%, more preferably 0.01-10wt%, and an excipient in an amount of 50~99.99wt%, preferably 80~99.9wt%, more preferably 90-99.5%, based on the total weight of the emulsion. The excipient comprises an oil phase, an aqueous phase, an emulsifier, a stabilizer and/or an osmoregulation agent. Butylphthalide or derivatives thereof may be either a raceme of butylphthalide or derivatives thereof, or /-butylphthalide or derivatives thereof.<br>
The excipient may comprise an oil phase in an amount of 0~50wt%, preferably 0.1~40wt%, an aqueous phase in an amount of 50~98wt%, preferably 60~97wt%, an emulsifier in an amount of 0.01~50wt%, preferably 0.5~10wt%, a stabilizer in an amount of 0~50wt%, preferably 0~15wt%, and an osmoregulation agent in an amount of 0~10wt%, all based on the total weight of the excipient.<br>
The process for manufacture of the butylphthalide intravenous emulsion of the present invention comprises the steps of, such as preparing a primary emulsion, homogenizing, sterilizing and quality controlling. The step of preparing the primary emulsion is carried out by utilizing ultrasonic method or high-speed shearing method (FA25 Model High Shear Emulsifying Machine, FLUKO Equipment Shanghai Co., Ltd.). The step of homogenizing is<br><br><br>
carried out by utilizing a two-stage high pressure emulsifying and homogenizing method (Niro-Soavi NS1001L Model High Pressure Homogenizer and Avestin EmulsiFlex-C5 High Pressure Homogenizer) or microfluidizing technology. The step of sterilizing is carried out by using high pressure sterilizing under rotation. The quality controlling is mainly carried out by measuring particle size.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) Selection of oil phase<br>
In the emulsion of the present invention, the oil phase generally has an amount in mass of 0-50% (w/v). It is required in the present invention that a therapeutically effective amount of drug should be dissolved in a relatively small amount of oil phase, no drug precipitate occurs or no layer separation occurs under cryogenic storage condition, and in the meantime a stable emulsion is able to be formed with an aqueous phase in the presence of an emulsifier. The oil phase as used in the present invention may be a natural vegetable oil with long chain fatty acid ester groups or a vegetable oil or fatty acid ester being subjected to structure modification and hydrolysis. The examples of those may be one of or a mixture of soybean oil (especially in injection grade), castor oil, tea-seed oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, rape oil, safflower oil, olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil and cacao oil; or may be a glyceride with a chain length of C6-C12 fatty acid, such as but not limited to Arlacel 80, Arlacel 86, Capmul MCM, Captex 200 (oil), Captex 355 (oil), Miglyol 812 (oil), Myvacet (oil), Myverol 18-92, glyceride oleate, glyceride linoleate, macrogol glyceryl laurate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, caprylocaproyl triglyceride, and a mixture thereof; or may be a mixture of the above long chain fatty acid esters and medium-chain fatty acid esters.<br>
