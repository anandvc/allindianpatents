The invention relates to the field of antiviral therapy and, in paiticular, to non-nucleoside reveerse transcriptase inhibitors for treating Human Immunodeficiency Vims (HIV) mediated diseases. The invention provides novel pyiazole compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods for treatment or prophylaxis of HCV mediated diseases employing said compounds in monotherapy or in combination therapy.<br>
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease cliaracrerized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of the 004"^ T-cell, with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV infection is also associated with a precursor AIDs-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.<br>
In common with other retroviruses, the HIV genome encodes protein precursors known as gag and gag-pol which are processed by the viral protease to afford the protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), endonuclease/inlegrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core, interruption of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus. Considerable efforts have been directed towards the control of HIV by inhibition of idrally encoded enzymes.<br>
Currentiy available chemotherapy targets two crucial viral enzymes: HTV protease and HIV reverse transcriptase. (J. S, G. Montaner et al. Aiiiiretroviral therapy: "Tlie State oftlie Art", Biomed. &amp; Phannacother. 1999 53:63-72; R. W, Shafer and D. A. Vuitton, Highly active ojitiretroviral therapy (HAART)for the treatmeiU of infection with hiwmn immunodeficiency \'ints type 1, Biomed. &amp; Pharmacother.1999 53:73-86; E. De Clercq, New Developments in Anti-HIV CJiemotlierap. Curr. Med. Chein. 2001 S-.i543-1572). Two general classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) have been identified: nucleoside revise transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).<br>
NRTIs typically are 2',3'-dideoxy!iucleoEide (ddN) analogs that must be phosphorylated prior to interacting with viral RT. The corresponding triphosphates function as competitive inhibitors ox altemative substrates for viral RT, After incorpctration into nucleic acids the nucleoside analogs terminate the chain elongation process. HEV reverse transcriptase has DNA editing capabilities<br><br>
which enable resistant strains to overcome the blockade by clea^'mg the nucleoside analog and continuing the elongation. Currently clinically used NRTIs include zido\Tidine (A2T), didanosine (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC). stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TQ and tenofovir (PMPA).<br>
NNRTIs Were first discovCTed in 19S9.NNRTI are allosteric inhibitors wliich bindreversibly at a nonsubstrate binding site on the HIV reverse transcriptase thereby altering the shape of the active site or blocking polymerase activity. (R. W. Bucfcheit, Jr., Non~nucleoside re\'erse transcriptase ifihibitors: perspectives for novel therapeutic compounds and strategies for treatment of HIV infection. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2001 10(8)1423-1442; E. De Qercq The role ofnon-nucleoside reverse trcaiscriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the therapy ofHW-I infection, Antiviral Res. 1998 38:153-179; G. Moyle, Tlie Emerging Roles of Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors iji Antiviral Tlierapy, Drugs 2001 61(l):19-26) Although over thirty structural classes of NNRTIs have been identified in the laboratory, only three compounds have been approved for HIV therapy: efavu-enz, nevirapine and delavirdjne. Although initially viewed as a promising class of compounds, in vitro and in vivo studies quickly revealed the NNRTIs presented a low barrier to the emergence of drug resistant HIV strains when used in monotherapy as well as having and class-specific toxicitjf. Drag resistance frequently develops with only a single point mutation in the RT.<br>
While combination therapy with NRTIs, Pis and NNRTIs has, in many case^, dramatically lowered viral loads and slowed disease progressdon, significant therapeutic problems remain. The cocktails are not effective in all patients, potentiaBy severe adverse reactions often occur and the rapidly reproducing HIV virus has proven adroit at creating mutant drug-resistant variants of wild-type protease and reverse transcriptase.<br>
There remains a need for safer drugs with activity against wild type and commonly occurring resistant strains of HIV.<br>

Compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equihbrimn and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose cheinicai and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equihbrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many ahphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto/enol (-C(=0)-CH- ^ -C(-OH)=CH-), amide/imidic acid (-CC=0)-NH- ^ -C(-OH)=N-) and amidme (-C(=NR}-NH- ^ -C(-NHR)=N-) tautomers.

Alteraati-v'ely, the C-4 aldehyde can be caiverted to an alkene 14 (Scheme 3) or substituted alkene with a Wittig reagent or Emmons-Wadsworth reagent (see J. W. Schulenberger and S. Archer, Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp;. Sons, New York 1965 vol. 14, chapter 1, pp. 1-51; J. March, Advtsiced Organic Oiemistry, 4"' ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pp. 956-963). The olefination reaction is carried out by procedures similar to those described in the hterature, for example in the presence of a strong base such as 7?--butyl lithimn or preferably sodium hydride in an organic solvent such as anhydrous ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, dioxane, preferably anhydrous tetrahydrofiiran under inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon atmosphere at a reaction temperature &amp;om 0°C to 80°C, preferably at a reaction temperature between about 5°C and about 50°C. The olefination affords an efficient method for homologation of the C-i substituent.<br>
Optionally the resulting alkene may be reduced to 15a by catal5^c hydrogenation wi^ standard platinum, paHadimn and ruthenium catalyst on supporting materials such as activated carbon or<br><br>
alumina, or generally as described in textbooks about organic chemistry (e.g. J. March (1992), Advaiiced Organic Chemistry: Reactiom, Mechanisms, and Structure, 4^ ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pp. 771-7S0) under a pressure from 1-40 atmospheres; or, by dissolving metal reduction (Yuon et al., TetraJiedron Lett 1986 27:2409; Hudlicky et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987 28:5287) if desired. Appropriate solvents iar the hydrogenation reaction axe organic solvent such as alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol), ethers (e.g. tetrahydiofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyelhane), esters (e.g. ethyl acstate), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. dichlorometbane) or hydrocarbons {e.g. hexane, cyclohexane and toluene).

Reduction of 15a with diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H), lithium aluminum hydride or lithium triethylborohydride affords the diol I5b.<br>
Introduction of substituents at the C-4 can also be accon5)Iished by an acylation of the hydroxypyrazole (Scheme 4). The acyl derivative 16 (step a) wherein R^^ is alkyl, aryl or aralky! is formed by leacting the correspondiag acid chloride with a 5-hydroxy-pyrazole 2. The reaction is conveniently carried out mider conditions known from acylation reactions for exanqile in an inert solvent, such as ethers e.g. anhydrous tetrahydrofnran, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, dioxane, or a mixture of the mentioned solvents, at a reaction temperature ftom room temperature to boiling ten5)erature of the reaction mixture in the presence of a catalyst such as Ca{0H)2, KjCOs, AlCIs, BF3, FeCh, SnCLi or ZnQ:.<br>
The 5-hydraxy pyrazole 16 is easily converted to a 5-chloropyrazole derivative 17 with a chlorinating agent such as (C0a)2, HCl, PCI5, PQs, S0a2 or POCls. The reaction is conveitiently carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon atmosphere at a reaction temperature from room temperature to boiling lemperatLue of the reaction rmxture. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of phogshorus oxychloride (POCI3) at a reaction temperature between about 5Q°C and about 180°C. Optionally, the reaction can be carried out in an organic solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. dichloromethane or chioroform), hydrocarbons (e.g. cyclohexane, methyl cycJohexane, decaline, benzene, toluene, o-xj'lene. j;i-xylene orp-xylene) or a mixtures of the mentioned solvents.<br><br><br>
deduction of the carbonyl IS to alkane 19 (scheme 4, step d) is accomplished with alkylsilaiie in ie presence of a protic or Lewis acid. The reaction is conveniently caiiied out with trimethylsUane, triethylsilane or tripropylsilane. Trtfluoroacetic acid (IFA) is the preferred protic acid and SnCJ4 is the preferred Lewis acid (D. L. Comins et al, Tetrahedron. Lett., 1986, 27:1869) at a reaction temperature from 0°C to SO^C, preferably at a reaction teaperature between about 5°C and about SO^C. Optionally, the oxo derivative IS is directly reduced to Ihe corresponding methylene 19 using other procedures known in the art, e.g., the Qemmensen reduction, the Wolff-Kischner reduction and hydogenolysis of thioacetals or reduction.<br><br><br>
The C-3 ester or pyrazoles 5 and 25 (Scheme 5) are converted into the corresponding amides 45 by transamidation or by saponification of the ester which can be then be converted to the amide by standard methodology (J. March Advanced Organic Oiemistry. 4'*' Ed J Wiley &amp; Sous: New York 1991; pp 419-424). A pyrazole with a nitrUe 23 is converted to the corresponding imidate 46 by treating the nitrile with an alcohol in the presence of hydrochloric acid. R. Sandler and W. Karo, Organic Functional Group Preparations, 2°^ Ed-, Academic Press, New Yort, vol, m, }S&gt;S6, pp. 314-330). Amidines 47 are prepared by treating an imidate with a ammonia or a substituted amine or, alternatively by sequential treatment of an amide 45 with phosphorus oxychloride and ammonia or a substituted amine.<br>
The C-3 carbinol in 9 (Scheme 6) can be converted to esters (20; R" = C(=0)R^), carbonates (20; R^^ = C(=0)OR^) and carbamates (20; R^^ = C(=0)NHR^) by condensation of 9 with acid chlorides or anhydrides, alfcylchloroformates, and isocyanates respectively (J. Maich. Advanced Organic Chemistry i^ Ed J Wiley &amp; Sons: New Ycdc, 1991; p-p 392-396 and S9I-S92; S. R. Sandler and W. Karo, Organic Functional Group Preparations, 2""* Ed., Academic Press, New York, vol. 1,1983, pp. 299-304; vol. H, 19S6, 260-271). Ethers (20; R'^ = altj'l or aralfcyl) can<br><br>
be prepared by the Williamson ethei synthesis or Mitsunobu reaction (March supra, pp. 386-87; S. R. Sandler and W. Karo, Organic Functioiial Group Preparations, T^ Ed., Academic Press, New York, vol. 1,1983, pp. 129-133). The Williamson ether synthesis may be preferably carried oiit in an organic solvent such as polar aprotic solvents like N,N-dimethylacetarDide or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran using a base such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, potassium hydride, potassium rert-butoxide, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or organic amines such as triethylamine or an N-alkyl morpholine such as N-methylmorpholine ^ a reaction tenqrerature between about -10°C and about 60°C, preferably at room temperature. Alternatively, the carbinol can be conva:ted to an alkyl halide and reacted with an alkali metal phenoxide.<br>
Amines 21 WM'e prepared from the alcohol 9 by the Mitsunobu condensation (March supra^ pp. 414415). Treatment of 21 TOth acylating agents provides amides (22; R" = COR*), carbamates (22; R^^ = COsR^) and ureas (22; R'^ = C(=0)NHR^). Guanidines (22; R^^ = C(=NH)NRV) are prepared from the thiourea (22; R'^ = C(=S)NHR*) by sequential treatment with dimethylsulfate and an amine. (Y. Yamamoto et al. Synthesis arid Chemistry of Guanidines in The Chemistry of Amidines and Imidates, S, Patai and Z. Rappoport (Eds.), Wiley &amp;. Sons, Chichester 1991, Chapter 10, pps.489-492). Condensation of the amine with a sulfonylating agent produces the corresponding sulfonamide (22; R^^ = SO2R*)-<br><br><br>
The homologous amine and carbinol derivatives are prepared by a two-step process comprising conversion of the primaiy alcohol to an alkyl halide and displacement of the halide with sodium cyanide. The resulting nitrile 23 can be reduced to the amine 24 (R}^ = H) by sequential treatment with diisobutylaluminum hydride and sodium borohydride. The resulting amine 24 (B}^ = H) can be treated with acylating, alkylating and sulfonylating agents. Hydrolysis and esterificatjon of 23 )'ielded the corresponding ester 25 (R" = Me) which was reduced to alcohol (26; R'^ = H) and further derivatized with alkylating and acylating agents as described above.<br><br><br>
Introduction of heterocyclylaityl substituents onto the C-3 position of the pyrazole was accomplished by modification of the nitrile 23 or the ester 25. Pyridazinones 28 were prepared by base-catalyzed condensation of the appropriately substituted ester orrutrile and 3,6-dichloropyridazine (Scheme 7). The condensation is accomplished efficientiy with sodium hydride and DMF. Hydrolysis of 27a or 27b under acidic conditions with aqueous hydrochloric acid and acetic acid resulted in hydrolysis, decarboxylation and concomitant hydrolj'sis of the chloropyridazine to produce pyridazinone 28.<br><br>
2-Oxo-2,3-dihydro-l,3,4-oxadiazoles 30a was prepared by cyclization of an acyl hydrazide 29 with phosgene (or equivalents such as carhonyl diimidazole, alkyl chloroformates and the hke) to directly produce the desired oxadiazole. (A. Hetzheim, 1,3,4 Oxadiazoles in Houben-Weyl Metlioden der Orgamschen Chemie, Hetarene EI/Teil 3, Band E8c; Verlag, Stuttgart; 1994, pp531-536) (Scheme 7) 2-Oxo-2,3-dihydro-l,3,4-thiadiazoles 30b are prepared by condensation of an 0-aIkyl imidate 31 and methoxythiocarbonyl hydrazide which produce a 2'methoxy-3,4-thidiazole derivative 32 which was hydrolyzed to the corresponding 2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-l,3,4-   ■ thiadiazole 30b unda- acidic conditions (H. Kristinsson et al. Helv. Chbn. Acta 1982 65:2606). Alternatively, cyclization of N-acyl-N'-aUcoxycarbonyl hydrazides with Lawesson's reagent can dhectly produce the thiadiazole (B, P. Rasmussen et al. Bull. Soc. Chbn. Fr. 1985 62). Triazolones 34 can be prepared by carbamoylation of an acyl hydrazide 29 with ethyl isocyanate to yield an N-acyl-N-carbamoylhydrazide 33 cyclized to the triazolone 34 upon treatment with methanohc potassium hydroxide.<br>
Other heteroaryl-contaioing side chains were accessible by exploiting variations readily accessible at the 3-position which. Halomethyi compounds {see, e.g., 37) are susceptible to nucleophilic displacement by heteroatoms which produced the imidazol-l-ylmethj'l (67), pjTazoI-l-ylmethyl (6S) and N-substituted uracUs (72) compounds, (see exan^les 41 and 42) Linkages to a carbon atom of heteroaryl substituents can be iatroduced by adding an appropriately protected organometallic compound to a pyrazole with aldehyde-containing side chains (e.g. 105) followed by reductive removal of the carbinol moiety and subsequent deprotcction if appropriate (see examples 43-44,46 and 47).   Heteroaryl and heterocycles also can be introduced by [l,3]dipolarcycladditions of 1,3-dipolar compounds and to multiple bonds (see, e.g, J. yi2ach-Advmced Organic Chemistry, 4"" Ed J Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991; pp 836-839). Thus cycloaddition of azides to nitriies affords the tetrazole 73 (example 36).<br>

It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of admiitistration and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the phaimacoldDetics of the present compoimds for maximum beneficial effect in patients.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amoimt required to reduce . symptoms of the disease in an individual. That dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For oral admimstration, adaily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between<br><br>
about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1,0 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the active compound or a salt can be administered in combination with another antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, another non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or HTV protease inhibitor. When the active compound or its derivative or salt are administered in combination with another antiviral ageot the activity may be increased over the parent compound. When the treatment is combination therapy, such administration may be concuirent or sequential with respect to that of the nucleoside derivatives, "Concurrent administration" as used herein thus includes administration of the agents at the same time or at different times.<br>
It will be understood that references herein to treatment extend to prophylaxis as well as to die treatment of existing conditions, and that the treatment of animals includes the treatment of humans as well as other animals. Furthermore, treatment of a HIV infection, as used herein, also includes treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or a condition associated with or mediated by HI\^ infection, or the clinical symptoms thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage fonn can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or anq)Oules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>

Example 53<br>
HIV Reverse Transcriptase Assay: lohibitor IC-ai determination HIV-] RT assay was carried out in 96-well Millipore MidtiScreen MADVNOB50 plates using pniified recombinant enzyme and a poly(rA)/oligo(dT)i6 template-primer in a total volume of 50 pL. The assay constituents were 50 nM Tris/HQ, 50 mM NaCi, 1 mfil EDTA, 6 roM MgQs, 5 ]M dlTP, 0.15 nCi fB] dTTP, 5 jJ-g/ml poly (rA) pre annealed to 2.5 |.ig/ml oligo (dT)i6 and a range of inhibitor concentrations in a final concentration of 10% DMSO. Reactions were initiated by adding 4 nM HI\'-1 RT and after incubation at ST^C for 30 rain, they were stopped by the addition of 50 |il ice cold 20%TCA and allowed to precipitate at 4°C for 30 min. The precipitates were collected by applying vacuum to the plate and sequentially washing with 3 x 200 ^il of 10% TCA and 2 x 200 )xl 70% etbanol. Finally, the plates were dried and radioacti\ity counted in a Packard TopCounter after the addition of 25 jA scintillation fluid per well. ICso's were calculated by plotting % inhibition versus logio inhibitor concentrations. Representative IC5D data has been included in Table 2.<br>
Aativical assay method:<br>
Anti-HIV antiviral activity was assessed using an adaptation of the method of Pauwels et al. {Pauwels et al., 198S, J Virol Methods 20:309-321}. The method is based on the ability of compounds to protect HIV-infected T lymphoblastoid cells (MI4 cells) from cell-death mediated<br><br>
by the infection. The endpoint of the assay was calculated as the concentration of compound at which the ceU viability of the cultuie was preserved by 50% ('50% inhibitory concentration', IC50). The cell viability of a culture was determined by the uptake of soluble, yellow 3-[4,5-dimethylthia2oi-2-yI]-2,5-diphenyltetrazohum bromide (MTT) and its reduction to a purple insoluble foimazan salt. After solubilization, spectrophotometric methods were employed to measure the amount of fonnazan product.<br>
MT4 cells were prepared to be in logarithmic-phase growth and a total of 2 x 10^ cells infected with the HXB2-stram of HEV at a multiplicity of 0.0001 infectious units of vims per cell in a total volume of between 200-500 microliters. The cells were incubated with virus for one hour at 37°C before rem.ovai of virus. The cells are then washed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 before being resuspended in culture medium for incubation in culture with serial dilutions of test compound. The culture medium used was RPMI1640 without phenol red, supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutanune and 10% fetal calf serum (GMIO).<br>
Test compounds were prepared as 2 mM solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Four repUcate, serial 2-fold dilutions in GMIO were then prepared and 50 microliters amounts placed in 96-well plates over a final nanomolar concentration range of 625 - 1.22. Fifty microliters GMIO and 3.5 x 10'^ infected cells were then added to each well. Control cultures containing no cells (blank), iminfected cells (100% viabihty; 4 repUcates) and infected cells without compound (total \Tms-naediated cell death; 4 replicates) were also prepared. The cultures were dien incubated ai 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO; in air for 5 days.<br>
A fresh solution of 5 mg/mL MTT was prepared in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 and 20 microliters added £0 each culture. The cultures wens further incubated as tefore for 2 hours. They were then mixed by pipetting up and down and 170 microliters of Triton X-100 in acidified isopropanol (10% v/v Triton X-100 in 1:250 mixture of concentrated HQ in isopropanol). When the formazan deposit was Mly solubUized by further mixing, the absorbance (OD) of the cultures was measured at 540nm and 690nm wavelength (690 nm readings were used as blanks for artifacts between wells). The percent protection for each treated culture was then calculated from the equation:<br>
% Protection =<br>
(OD drug-treated cultures) - (OD untreated virus control cultures)<br>
X 100%<br>
(OD uninfected cultures) - (OD untreated virus control cultures)<br><br>
The ICso can be obtained fcom graph plots of percent protection versus logio drug concentration.<br>
