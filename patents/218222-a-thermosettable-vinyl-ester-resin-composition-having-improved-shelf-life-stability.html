				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vinyl ester resins are known for their excellent corrosion resistance and physical strength. They are used when reacted with unsaturated monomers, in the manufacture of boats, windmill blades, chemical resistant storage tanks and pipes as well as ducting to handle chemical fumes. Liquid thermosettable vinyl ester resins are known to have a limited shelf life. Typically they must be stored in temperature controlled environments at 25°C (77°F) and must be used up within 3 to 6 months or they will polymerize into a solid in their containers and become unusable. Past efforts have focused on the use of inhibitor additives to improve shelf life without adversely affecting the catalyzed gel times of the vinyl ester. Typical shelf life enhancing inhibitors include phenothiazine (U.S. Patent 3.6S3,045), copper naphthenate (JP 53,111,397), and certain imidizole compounds (U.S. Patent 5,034,437, EP -436,921 and JP 3,103,446). Other shelf life ennancing inhibitors include certain hydroxylamines (U.S. Patent 3,408.442), oxalic acid (U.S. Patent 4,407,991), rnaieic anhydride (JP 1,240.509), and certain chlorinated nitrophenoi compounds (U.S. Patent 4,413.105).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is the discover}' that esterifying a vinyl ester to a very low epoxy value greatly increases its storage life. This invention is also the discovery of a synergistic improvement in shelf life through the addition of small quantities of copper naphthenate to a vinyl ester resin esterified to a very low epoxy value.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Vinyl ester resins are described by Bowen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,066,112 and 3,179,623 wherein monocarboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrviic acid, are reacted with polyepoxide resins. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,367,992 Bearden describes vinyl esters derived from dicarboxylic acid half esters of hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates with polyepoxide resins. Vinyl ester resins based on epoxy novolac resins are described in U.S. Patent number 3.301,740 by Fekete et al. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,256,226 Fekete et al describe vinyl esters prepared from polyepoxides reacted with dicarboxylic acids as well as monofunctional carboxylic acids.<br>
Other multifunctional compounds containing groups which are reactive with an epoxide group, such as an amine, mercaptan. phenolic hydroxyl and the like may be used in addition to or in place of the dicarboxylic acid. .All of the above-described resins, which contain the characteristic linkages<br>
The composition of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the components thereof and is in fact a synergistic mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a thermosettable vinyl ester resin composition having improved shelf life stability comprising:<br>
(d)	a polyepoxide resin of the kind such as herein described having an epoxide equivalent weight of 70 to 2000<br>
(e)	a 0.99 to 25 % excess of unsaturated monocarboxylic acid equivalents to epoxide equivalents, and optionally<br>
(f)	a conventional shelf life stability enhancing inhibitor,<br>
said product having an epoxy value less than or equal to 3 units as measured by ASTM D1652-90, said resin composition optionally comprising copolymerizable monomers selected from vinyl and allyl aromatic compounds.<br>
Polybasic carboxylic acids and anhydrides that may also be employed can be ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid and itaconic acid. In addition, dicarboxylic acids free of ethylenic unsaturation such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and adipic acid may also be employed as reactants with the epoxides.<br>
Vinyl polymerization inhibitors used during processing, such as hydroquinone (HQ), mono-t-butyl hydroquinone (MTBHQ) and t-butyl catechol (TBC) are advantageously added to prevent premature polymerization during the preparation of the vinyl ester resin. Preferably, the vinyl polymerization inhibitor is included in the reaction mixture at a concentration of about 0.005 to about 0.04 percent by weight based on the total weight of the reactants.<br>
In the process of this invention it is advantageous to exclude the shelf life stability inhibitors, like phenothiazine and copper napthenate, during the esterification reaction. These specialized inhibitors can lead to unstable reaction conditions during processing which may cause the vinyl ester resin to gel inside the reactor.<br>
In preparing the vinyl ester resin, the polyepoxide(s) resins are charged to the reactor and may be reacted first with bisphenois or dibasic carboxylic acids. Next the monocarboxylic acid(s) and polymerization inhibitor(s) are charged and the reactants heated to a suitable reaction temperature between room temperature and about 150°C, preferably between 110°C and 130°C. Acid equivalent to epoxide equivalent ratios typically range from 0.99 to 1.25, preferably from 1.01 to 1.15. If desired a diluent may be provided in the reaction mixture. Non-reactive<br>
diluents may be employed such as toluene, x-ylene and the like. Preferably a copolymerizable diluent such as styrene, methyl methacrylate or diallyl phthalate is selected as the diluent since the diluent may be used as the copolymerizable carrier after completion of the esterification reaction. Typically the polyepoxide(s) resins and carboxylic acid(s) are catalytically esterified to a final carboxylic acid content of 1% (on a 100% plastic basis), which corresponds to an acid value of approximately 10 units by standard titration techniques (ASTM method D1639-90).<br>
In the process of this invention the vinyl ester resin is reacted (esterified) until a very low epoxy value is reached, preferably from 0.0001 to 3.0, as measured by standard titiation techniques. It is also advantageous to the process of this invention to provide excess carboxylic acid, preferably 5% to 15% excess acid equivalents to epoxide equivalents. At the epoxy value endpoint, the resin is blended with copolymerizable monomer(s) to 40 to 80 weight percent vinyl ester and from 60 to 20 weight percent of the copolymerizable monomer(s). Suitable monomers include vinyl and allylic aromatic compounds such as styrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene and diallyl phthalate. Other useful monomers include the esters of saturated alcohols and glycols such as methyl, ethyl and isopropyl alcohol, aiong with ethylene glycol, diethyiene giycoi, and hexanediol with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid; vinyl acetate, diallyl maleate, dimethylallyl fumarate; mixtures of the same and all other monomers which are capable of copolymerizing with the vinvl ester resin.<br>
Among the useful shelf life stability inhibitors are copper salts. Copper naphthenate is available commercially as an 8% solution in petroleum distillates and is preferably used as a shelf life stabilizer at a concentration of from 5 to ] 00 parts per million. Higher amounts can be used, but may have a deleterious effect upon the gel time. In the process of this invention the addition of small quantities of copper naphthenate to a vinyl ester resin esterified to a very low epoxy value displayed a synergistic improvement in shelf life stability. The stabilizing agent is usually added to the prepared resin after admixture with the vinyl monomer.<br>
Catalysts that may be used for the curing or polymerization are preferably the peroxide and hydroperoxide catalysts such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) or t-butyl perbenzoate. The amount of the catalyst added can vary, preferably from 0.1 percent to about 5 percent by weight of the resin phase.<br>
Preferably, the cure of the resin can be initiated at room temperature by the addition of accelerating agents or promoters, such as lead, potassium or cobalt naphthenate, N,N-dimethyl aniline or N.N-dimethyl-p-toluidine, usually in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 weight percent. The promoted/catalyzed composition of resin and monomer, when uninhibited, will usually be converted to at least a gel state in a few minutes and cured to a solid state in 30 minutes to one or two hours. That time will vary widely depending upon the particular vinyl ester resins and vinyl monomer used, the catalyst and promoter system employed and its concentration, the temperature and other factors.<br>
It is an advantage of this invention that the shelf life stability of a vinyl ester resin can be dramatically improved through a change in processing techniques; thus precluding the need for adding expensive stabilizing inhibitors to the resin.  Further benefit can be obtained from the addition of stabilizing inhibitors and a synergistic improvement in shelf life stability was noted when small amounts of copper naphthenate were added to a vinyl ester resin esterified to a very low epoxy value.<br>
The benefits and advantages of the invention and the best mode for carrying out the same as illustrated in the following examples wherein all parts and percents are by weight and all units are in the metric system unless otherwise specified. All references mentioned herein are expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
The following vinyl esters thinned in sryrene were used: EXAMPLE A (standard process)<br>
One mole of bisphenol A was catalytically reacted with two moles of diglycidylether of bisphenol A at 150°C for two hours under atmospheric conditions. This yielded a polyepoxide resin having an epoxide equivalent weight of 500 which was subsequently cooled to 130°C. Next, one mole of methacrylic acid and 180 ppm of hydroquinone (based on finished product) were added under an air sparge and esterified at 120°C until an acid value less than 10 units was recorded. The vinyl ester resin was then cooled to 110°C and 0.05 moles of maleic anhydride were added. The vinyl ester resin was allowed to continue esterifying for 15 minutes at these conditions before thinning with styrene monomer to 65% non-volatiles and cooling to room temperature. This product is the control. EXAMPLE B (processed to low epoxy value)<br>
This vinyl ester resin was prepared the same way as Example A, except that 1.13 moles of methacrylic acid were used and the vinyl ester resin was esierified to an epoxy value less than two units before coaling to 110°C and adding maleic anhydride. This product was thinned in styrene monomer to 65% non-volatiles and cooled to room temperature.<br>
-The liquid properties for Examples A and B are listed in Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
1)	Based on ASTM method D 1644-88<br>
2)	Based on ASTM methods D 2393-86 and D 1824-90<br>
3)	Based on ASTM method D 1639-90<br>
4)	Based on ASTM method D 1652-90<br>
An 8% copper naphthenate solution in petroleum spirits was then blended into both vinyl ester resins at 0 ppm, 5 ppm, and 10 ppm. concentrations. These vinyl ester<br>
resins were then compared for ge! time properties at 25°C and 82°C, as well as shelf life stability at 54°C. Sec Tables 2 and 3.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
5) Gel time at 25°C (77°F)<br>
One hundred grams of sample is removed from a jar kept in 2 constant temperature bath and weighed into a 6 oz paper cup.  0.1 grams of dimethyl aniiine and 0.3 grams of 6 percent cobalt naphthenate in petroleum spirits are then mixed in thoroughly.   1.5 grams of 60 percent methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) in dimethyl phthalate is added and mixed thoroughly for one minute before placing<br>
the cup onto a T-cam gelometer. The thermocouple and the spindle are immersed. The gelometer is started at 1.5 minuies after the catalyst addition and the timeAemperaturc recorder is started at 2.0 minutes after the catalyst addition. When the product gels, the T-cam is stopped from oscillating which triggers the gelometer timer to stop. This time plus 1.5 minutes is the gel time. After the cure and exotherm are complete the chart recorder paper is removed and the time is measured off the chart from start to the maximum exotherm temperature. This time plus 2.0 minutes is the peak time, and the peak exotherm temperature is recorded off the chart as well.<br>
6)Gel time at 82°C(180oF)<br>
0.5 grams of benzoyl peroxide are mixed with 0.5 grams of styrene in a 6 oz paper cup. 50 grams of sample are weighed in and mixed for one minute before pouring into two test tubes to a level of 3 inches. The thermocouple probes are inserted into the sample and allowed to stand 10 minutes to remove air bubbles. The test tubes are placed in a constant temperature bath maintained at 82°C (180°F) and the chart recorder started. After the catalyzed sample is cured and the exotherm expired, the chart paper is removed and measured for gel time and peak time as well as the peak exotherm temperature. The ge! time is defined as the time from when the resin has increased in temperature from 66°C (150°F) to 88°C (190°F). The peak time is defined as the time from when the resin has increased from 66°C '1500F) to where the peak exotherm temperature occurred. The peak exotherm :emperature is recorded off the chart as well.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
7) Stability at 54°C(130°F)<br>
100 grams of sample are weighed into 4 oz glass jars, sealed, and placed in an air circulated oven maintained at 54°C (130°F). Sample stability was checked daily by inverting the jars and observing for a layer of solid at the bottom of the jar or whether the sample appears stringy in consistency.<br>
As shown in Table 3 Example A, having an epoxy value of 7.3 units, gelled after 12 days of storage while Example B having an epoxy value of 1.1 units, did not gel until 19 days; a 58% improvement. By comparison, the addition of 5 ppm and 10 ppm of copper naphthenate improved the shelf life by 50% and S3% respectively.<br>
Even more noteable was the synergistic 350% and 375% increase in stability when 5ppm and 10 ppm copper naphthenate were added to Example B, having a 1.1 units epoxy value. With 2 months shelf life stability at 130°F, vinyl ester resins would no longer need to be transported in refrigerated trucks or containers,<br>
nor would the majority of customers need to store their vinyl ester resins in temperature controlled environments.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
