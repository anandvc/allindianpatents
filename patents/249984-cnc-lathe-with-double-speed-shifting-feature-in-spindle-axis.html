				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a CNC lathe with double-<br>
speed shifting feature in spindle axis, and particularly to a CNC lathe<br>
using a screw rod having a positive thread section and a counter<br>
thread section in association with two nuts respectively secured on a<br>
tool holder assembly and a worktable assembly to simultaneously<br>
shift the tool holder assembly and the worktable assembly in<br>
opposite directions along a spindle axis, so as to significantly increase<br>
the relatively shifting speed between the tool holder assembly and<br>
the worktable assembly, to minimize non-cutting time of the CNC<br>
lathe.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Generally, in order to accomplish the purpose for cutting a<br>
workpiece by a tool, a computer numerical control (CNC) tool<br>
machine is equipped with facility for feeding the tool toward the<br><br><br>
workpiece during a cutting operation period and with facility for<br>
changing and adjusting the relative positions between the tool and<br>
the workpiecc during a non-cutting operation period. In the cutting<br>
operation, the speed for feeding the tool toward the workpiece is<br>
determined by the characteristics of the material to be machined, and<br>
thus shall not be changed or increased arbitrarily. However, if the<br>
speed for shifting or adjusting the relative positions between the tool<br>
and the workpiece during the non-cutting operation period is<br>
increased, the overall machining speed and efficiency of the tool<br>
machine will be greatly improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a CNC lathe,<br>
in which the relatively shifting speed along the spindle between the<br>
tool and the workpiece is the double of the relatively shifting speed<br>
of the conventional one of applying a screw rod/nut-mechanism to<br><br><br>
simply shift either the tool or the workptcce. The present invention<br>
applies a screw rod having two sections of opposite threads, namely a<br>
positive thread section and a counter thread section, in association<br>
with two nuts separately secured on a tool holder assembly and a<br>
workable assembly to accomplish the relative movement or shifting<br>
of the tool and the workpiece along the spindle axis, so that the<br>
non-cutting operation time of a CNC lathe is significantly reduced,<br>
and the overall machining speed and efficiency are improved.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a CNC<br>
vertical lathe, in which a tool holder 'assembly and a worktable<br>
assembly are reciprocatably disposed along a vertical spindle axis by<br>
virtue of a screw rod having two sections of opposite threads,<br>
namely a positive thread section and a counter thread section,<br>
respectively, in association with two nuts respectively secured on the<br>
tool holder assembly and the worktable assembly, so that a<br>
servomotor, when rotating the screw rod clockwise or<br>
counterclockwise to shift the relative position along the vertical<br>
spindle axis between the tool holder assembly and the worktable<br>
assembly, is of a substantially identical and constant load, without<br>
using any additional balance weight.<br><br><br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
CNC vertical lathe that can avoid the tool holder to collide with the<br>
workpiece or the machine, when the electric power is unexpectedly<br>
off or the servomotor is not energized.<br>
Futher benefits and advantages, operational principle and<br>
construction of the present invention will become apparent after a<br>
careful reading of the detailed description with appropriate reference-<br>
to the accompanying drawings m which like reference numerals<br>
identify like elements.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT<br>
INVENTION<br>
Fig 1. illustrates a conventional horizontal lathe having a<br>
spmdle S horizontally and rotatably disposed on a stationary base<br>
secured on a frame of the lathe, for gripping a workpiece to be<br>
machined. Since a workpiece to be machined is gripped on one end<br>
of the spindle S pivoted on a stationary base, it is rotatable but not<br>
shiftable. A tool holder B is applied for holding a tool for cutting the<br>
workpiece, and is shiftable relatively to the workpiece. Generally, the<br>
tool holder B is reciprocatable along the spindle axis (e.g., Z axis) by<br>
virtue of a screw rod R rotated by a servomotor M in association<br>
with a nut N secured on the tool holder B, so that the tool can get<br>
closer to or to depart away from the workpiece when the servomotor<br>
M rotates the screw rod R clockwise or counterclockwise. The tool<br><br><br>
holder B is also provided along an axis perpendicular to the spindle<br>
axis with a further screw rod, similar to the one pivotally disposed<br>
along the spindle axis, so that the tool is shiftable along another<br>
direction (e.g., X-axis) relative to the workpiece, when the further<br>
screw rod is rotated.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a conventional CMC vertical lathe, in which a<br>
workpiece to be machined is gripped on a spindle pivotally disposed<br>
on a stationary worktable T. Similar to the conventional horizontal<br>
lathe as described above, a tool secured on a tool holder B of the<br>
conventional vertical lathe is reciprocatable respectively along the<br>
spindle axis (Z-axis) and the X-axis respectively by a screw rod/nut<br>
mechanism, so that the tool can get closer to or depart away from<br>
the workpiece in two-dimensional directions.<br>
Fig.3 illustrates a conventional CNC reverse spindle vertical<br>
lathe having a construction substantially identical with the<br>
conventional vertical lathe, excepting that a tool holder B thereof is<br>
stationarily mounted on the frame, and a workpiece to be machined<br><br><br>
is gripped on a spindle pivotally disposed on a worktable T shiftable<br>
relatively to the tool. Similar to the conventional vertical lathe as<br>
described above, the conventional reverse spindle vertical lathe is<br>
reciprocatable along the spindle axis (Z-axis) and the X-axis<br>
perpendicular to the spindle axis, respectively by a screw rod/nut<br>
mechanism, so that the workpiece is shiftable relatively to the tool in<br>
two dimensions.<br>
Referring to the conventional manner of applying a screw<br>
rod/nut mechanism, e.g., the transmission mechanism including the<br>
screw pair of the screw rod R and the nut N illustrated in Fig. 1, to<br>
change the relative positions between a tool holder and a worktable,<br>
if one intends to increase the speed for the tool holder to get closer<br>
to or to depart away from the worktable, he can only accomplish this<br>
purpose by increasing the rotation of the screw rod by using a higher<br>
speed servo motor. It is, however, found that none of the existing<br>
servomotors available in marketplace would satisfy this need for<br><br><br>
providing a satisfactory shifting speed between the tool holder and<br>
worktable during the non-cutting operation period.<br>
Especially, when the conventional screw rod/nut mechanism is<br>
applied to reciprocate the tool holder along a vertical axis, e.g. when<br>
the tool holder B is reciprocated along vertical Z-axis by the screw<br>
rod R in association with the nut: N of the conventional CNC<br>
vertical lathe illustrated in fig. 2 the load of the servomotor M to<br>
rotate the screw rod R for upwardly shifting the tool holder B is<br>
significandy greater than the load of the servomotor M for<br>
downwardly shifting the tool holder B, due to the weight of the tool<br>
holder B. This not only reduces the service life of the servomotor,<br>
but also is disadvantageous to the control of the operational speed.<br>
To overcome such problem as to the servomotor bearing different<br>
loads when driving a screw rod to upwardly and downwardly shift<br>
the tool holder B, the conventional art applies a chain, wire or the<br>
like to draw a balance weight, Co balance the weight of the tool<br>
holder B, and to avoid the problem that the servomotor has different<br><br><br>
loads when upward and downward shifting the tool holder B.<br>
Though this is feasible and practicable, it makes a lathe complicated<br>
in construction, bulky and cumbersome, and disadvantageous for<br>
manufacture and maintenance.<br>
Referring to the conventional CNC vertical lathe illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2 the tool holder is shifted upward or downward when the<br>
servomotor M clockwise or counterclockwise rotating the screw rod<br>
R Such an operation manner and construction of applying a<br>
servomotor M in association with a screw rod/nut mechanism to<br>
upward and downward shift a tool holder B, when electric power is<br>
unexpectedly off or the servo motor is not energized, the weight of<br>
the tool holder B creates a torque to rotate the freely rotatable screw<br>
rod R, and is gradually moved downward by the weight of the tool<br>
holder B. This would subsequently result in that the tool holder B<br>
collides with and damages the workpiecc, worktable, or the other<br>
parts of the machine.<br><br><br>
Certain terminology may be employed in the following<br>
description for convenience rather than for any limiting purpose. For<br>
example, the terms "forward," "rearward," "right," "left," "upper,"<br>
and "lower" designate directions in the drawings to which reference<br>
is made, with the terms "inward," "inner," or "inboard" and<br>
"outward," "outer," or "outboard referring, respectively, to directions<br>
toward and away from the center for the referenced element, the<br>
terms "radial" and "axial" referring, respectively, to directions or<br>
planes perpendicular and parallel to the longitudinal central axis of<br>
the referenced element. Terminology of similar import other than the<br>
words specifically mentioned above likewise is to be considered<br>
being used for purposes of convenience rather than in any limiting<br>
sense. To facilitate illustration and description, X, Y, and Z axes to<br>
be mentioned hereinafter are referred to three coordinate axes<br>
perpendicular to one another and indicated in the accompanying<br>
drawings. The vertical direction is referred to a direction substantially<br><br><br>
perpendicular to the ground, like reference numerals identify like<br>
elements in the accompanying drawings.<br>
As illustrated in fig. 4 a CNC lathe in accordance with the first<br>
preferable embodiment of the present invention is a CNC horizontal<br>
lathe comprising a frame 1, a worktable assembly 2 and a tool holder<br>
assembly 3; wherein the frame 1 has a lengthwise spindle direction Z<br>
and a widthwise direction X perpendicular to the lengthwise spindle<br>
direction Z. Two parallel rails 11 are provided on the frame 1 along<br>
the lengthwise spindle axis direction Z. A screw rod 12 comprising a<br>
positive thread section 121 and a counter thread section 122 is<br>
pivotally disposed on the frame 1 along the lengthwise spindle axis<br>
direction Z, and driven by a servomotor M to rotate clockwise or<br>
counterclockwise.<br>
The worktable assembly 2 comprises a worktable 21, two<br>
sliders 22 and a nut 23. The worktable 21 is provided with a<br>
machining spindle S rotatably driven by an electric motor (not<br>
shown), for gripping a workpiece to be machined at one end thereof.<br><br><br>
Two sliders 22 are secured at the bottom of the worktable 21 for<br>
separately and slidably engaging the parallel rails 11 for guiding the<br>
worktable assembly 2 to freely move on the frame 1 along the<br>
lengthwise spindle axis direction Z. The nut 23 is secured at the<br>
bottom of the worktable 21 and engages the positive thread section<br>
121 of the screw rod 12, so that when the servomotor M rotates the<br>
screw rod 12, the worktable assembly 2 is reciprocatable on the frame<br>
1 along the lengthwise spindle axis direction Z, by virtue of the nut<br>
23 in association with the positive thread section 121 of the screw<br>
rod 12.<br>
The tool holder assembly 3 comprises a Z-axis shifting seat 31,<br>
an X-axis shifting seat 32 and a tool holder 33; wherein the Z-axis<br>
shifting seat 31 is provided at its bottom two sliders 311 engaging the<br>
parallel rails 11 and a nut 312 engaging the counter thread section 122<br>
of the screw rod 12, so that when the screw rod 12 is rotated, the<br>
Z-axis shifting seat 31 is reciprocatable on the rails 11 of the frame 1<br>
in a direction opposite to the shifting direction of the worktable<br><br><br>
assembly 2 along the lengthwise spindle axis Z. The Z-axis shifting<br>
seat 31 is further provided along the X-axis with two parallel rails 313<br>
and a screw rod 314 pivotally disposed thereon. The X-axis shifting<br>
seat 32 is provided at its bottom two sliders 321 for slidably engaging<br>
the parallel rails 313 and a nut (not shown) for engaging the screw-<br>
rod 314, so that the X-axis shifting seat 32 is reciprocatable along<br>
X-axis when the screw rod 314 is rotated by a servomotor (not<br>
shown). The tool holder 33 is adjustably secured on the X-axis<br>
shifting seat 32.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4, 5 and 6, since the screw rod 12 pivotally<br>
disposed on the frame 1 along the spindle axis Z and comprising the<br>
positive thread section 121 and the counter thread section 122 for<br>
respectively in association with the nuts 23 and 312 respectively<br>
secured on the worktable assembly 2 and the tool holder assembly 3,<br>
when the screw rod 12 is rotated in a direction (e.g., the clockwise<br>
direction) by the servomotor M, the nuts 23 and 312 are<br>
simultaneously moved in opposite directions along the spindle<br><br><br>
direction Z to get closer to each other (see Fig.5), rendering the<br>
worktable assembly 2 and the tool holder assembly 3 are also<br>
simultaneously moved in opposite directions along the Z-axis to get<br>
closer to each other. Referring to Fig. 6, when the screw rod 12 is<br>
rotated in the other direction (e.g., the counterclockwise direction)<br>
by the servomotor M, the nuts 23 and 312 are simultaneously moved<br>
in opposite directions along Z-axis to depart away from each other,<br>
rendering the worktable assembly 2 and the tool holder assembly 3<br>
being also simultaneously moved in opposite directions along the<br>
Z-axis. No matter how a servomotor increases the rotation of a<br>
screw rod, the relatively shifting speed between the tool holder<br>
assembly and the worktable assembly along the spindle axis<br>
accomplished by using a screw rod 12 having a positive thread<br>
section 121 and a counter thread section 122 in association with two<br>
nuts 23 and 312 for simultaneously shifting tool the worktable<br>
assembly 2 and the holder assembly 3 in opposite directions as<br>
suggested by the present invention is the double of the conventional<br><br><br>
one accomplished by using a conventional screw rod having a single<br>
thread in association with a nut for simply shifting either the tool<br>
holder or the worktable. Therefore, the relatively shifting speed<br>
between the worktable assembly and the tool holder assembly along<br>
a pnmarily moving direction, e.g., the spmdle axis, is significantly<br>
increased. Further, since a lathe normally requires that a tool<br>
frequently moves relatively to the workpiece along the spindle axis<br>
for a long distance, the feature of the tool holder assembly and the<br>
worktable assembly simultaneously moving in opposite directions<br>
along the spindle axis significantly reduces the non-cutting time of a<br>
CNC lathe, thereby the overall machining time is shortened and the<br>
efficiency is improved.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a CNC vertical lathe in accordance with the<br>
second preferable embodiment of the present invention having a<br>
construction substantially identical with the CNC horizontal lathe<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4, excepting that the spindle thereof is extending in<br>
a vertical direction rather than in a horizontal direction. The CNC<br><br><br>
vertical lathe of the second embodiment comprises a frame 1', a<br>
worktable assembly 2' and a tool holder assembly 3', wherein the<br>
frame 1' comprises a frame foundation 13 and an upright stand 14<br>
vertically and upward extending from the frame foundation 13. The<br>
upright stand 14 is provided with two parallel rails 11' along the<br>
vertical spindle Z-axis, and a screw rod 12' pivotally disposed along<br>
the upright stand 14. The screw rod 12' comprises a positive thread<br>
section 121' and a counter thread section 122', and is rotated by a<br>
servomotor M.<br>
The worktable assembly 2' comprises a worktable 21', two<br>
sliders 22' and a nut: 23'. The worktable 21' is provided with a<br>
machining spindle S driven by an electric motor (not shown) for<br>
gripping a workpiece to be machined. Two sliders 22' are secured at<br>
one side of the worktable 21' for respectively in association with two<br>
parallel rails 11 for guiding the worktable assembly 2' to upward and<br>
downward reciprocate on the upright stand 14 along the vertical<br>
Z-axis. The nut 23' is secured at one side of the worktable 21' for<br><br><br>
engaging the positive thread section 121' of the screw rod 12', so that<br>
the nut 23' in association with the screw rod 12' reciprocates the<br>
worktable assembly 2' upward or downward along the vertical<br>
spindle Z - axis, when the screw rod 12' is rotated by the servomotor<br>
M.<br>
Tool holder assembly 3' comprises a Z-axis shifting seat 31', an<br>
X-axis shifting seat 32', and a, tool holder 33'; wherein the Z-axis<br>
shifting seat 31' is provided at its one side two sliders 311' slidably<br>
engaging the parallel rails 11' of the upright stand 14 and a nut 312'<br>
engaging the counter thread section 122' of the screw rod 12', so that<br>
the Z-axis shifting seat 31' is reciprocatable upward and downward<br>
along the upright stand 14 along the spindle Z-axis. The Z-axis<br>
shifting seat 31' is provided at the other side thereof two parallel rails<br>
313' extending along X-axis and a screw rod 314'. The X-axis shifting<br>
seat 32' is provided at one side thereof two sliders 321' engaging the<br>
parallel rails 313' of the Z-axis shifting seat 31' and a nut 322'<br>
engaging the screw rod 314', so that the X-axis shifting seat 32' is<br><br><br>
reciprocatable along X-axis on the Z-axis shifting seat 31'. The tool<br>
holder 33' is adjustably secured on the X-axis shifting seat 32' at one<br>
end thereof facing to the worktable assembly 2'.<br>
Since the screw rod 12' is pivotally disposed along the vertical<br>
spindle Z-axis and formed with the positive thread section 121' and<br>
the counter thread section 122' for respectively in association with<br>
the nut 23' of the worktable assembly 2' and the nut 312' of the tool<br>
holder assembly 3', if the worktable assembly 2' is designed to have a<br>
total weight substantially equivalent to a total weight of the tool<br>
holder assembly 3', then a torque created by the weight of the tool<br>
holder assembly 3' to rotate the screw rod 12' in one direction will be<br>
countervailed or neutralized by a counter torque created by the<br>
weight of the worktable assembly 2' to rotate the screw rod 12' in<br>
the other direction. Therefore, the loads for the servomotor M for<br>
rotating the screw rod 12' clockwise and counterclockwise are<br>
substantially identical with each other, and thus it is unnecessary to<br>
provide any additional balance weight to dimmish the load difference<br><br><br>
for the servomotor to rotate the vertical screw rod clockwise and<br>
counterclockwise.<br>
During the operation of the CNC vertical lathe, if it is<br>
unexpectedly power-off when a workpiece is placed on the worktable<br>
assembly 2', since the total weight of the worktable assembly 2' and<br>
the workpiece is slightly greater than the total weight of the tool<br>
holder assembly 3', the worktable assembly 2' moves downward<br>
slowly, and creates a torque to rotate the screw rod 12' to upwardly<br>
and slowly shift the tool holder assembly 3'. As a result, the tool<br>
fixed on the tool holder assembly 3' will never collide the workpiece<br>
placed on the worktable assembly 2', when the vertical lathe is<br>
switched off or unexpectedly power-off.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a CNC reverse spindle vertical lathe in<br>
accordance with the third preferable embodiment of the present<br>
invention having a construction similar to the CNC vertical lathe of<br>
the second embodiment illustrated in Fig. 7, excepting that the<br>
worktable assembly 2" is reversely disposed above the tool holder<br><br>
assembly 3". The worktable assembly 2" and the tool holder<br>
assembly 3" are simultaneously reciprocatable in opposite directions<br>
along the vertical spindle Z-axis driven a positive thread section 121"<br>
and a counter thread section 122" formed on a screw rod 12". In<br>
such CNC reverse spindle vertical lathe, the tool holder assembly 3"<br>
can be designed to have a total weight substantially equivalent to or<br>
slightly greater than a total weight of the worktable assembly 2" and<br>
a workpiece placed thereof, so that the worktable assembly 2" will<br>
never collide with the tool, or tool holder assembly 3".<br>
The above-described embodiment of the present invention is<br>
intended to illustrate only. Numerous alternative embodiments may<br>
be devised by persons skilled in the art without departing from the<br>
scope of the following claims.<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1. A CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis, for simultaneously shifting a worktablc assembly and a<br>
tool holder assembly so that the worktable assembly is shifted<br>
relative to the tool holder with a shifting speed double of a shifting<br>
speed between a worktable assembly and a tool holder assembly<br>
when only one of the worktable assembly and the tool holder<br>
assembly is moved; the CNC lathe comprising:<br>
a frame (1) having a lengthwise spindle axis direction Z and a<br>
widthwise direction X perpendicular to the lengthwise spindle axis<br>
direction Z;<br><br>
a screw rod (12) including two sections of opposite threads,<br>
namely a positive thread section (121) and a counter thread section<br>
(122), and pivotally disposed on the frame (1) in the lengthwise<br>
spindle axis direction Z;<br><br>
a worktable assembly (2) reciprocatably disposed on the frame<br>
(1) in the lengthwise spindle axis direction Z, including a first nut<br>
(312) engaging the counter thread section (122) of the screw rod for<br>
reciprocating the worktable assembly (2) in a shifting direction along<br>
the lengthwise spindle axis direction when the screw rod (12) is<br>
rotated in one direction;<br>
a tool holder assembly (3) reciprocatably disposed on the frame<br><br>
(1) along the lengthwise spindle axis direction Z, including a second<br>
nut (23) engaging the positive thread section (121) of the screw rod<br>
(12) for reciprocating the tool holder assembly (3) in a direction<br>
opposite to the shifting direction of the worktable assembly (2) along<br>
the lengthwise spindle axis Z when the screw rod (12) is rotated.<br>
2. The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 1, wherein the screw rod (12) is<br>
driven by a servomotor M to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise.<br><br><br>
3.	The CNC lathe with double speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lengthwise spindle axis<br>
direction Z is a vertical direction, and wherein the frame (1)<br>
comprises a frame foundation and an upright stand upward and<br>
vertically extending from the frame foundation; and wherein the<br>
screw rod is pivotally disposed on the upright stand along the vertical<br>
length spindle axis direction, so that the tool holder assembly and the<br>
worktable assembly are simultaneously upward or downward<br>
reciprocated in opposite directions along the vertical spindle axis<br>
direction.<br>
4.	The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 3, wherein the tool holder assembly is<br>
disposed above the worktable assembly.<br>
5.	The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 4, wherein the worktable assembly is<br><br><br>
of a weight substantially equivalent to or slightly less than a weight of<br>
the tool holder assembly.<br>
6.	The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 3, wherein the tool holder assembly is<br>
disposed below the worktable assembly.<br>
7.	The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle as claimed in claim 6, wherein the tool holder assembly is of a<br>
weight substantially equivalent to or slightly greater than a weight of<br>
the work-table assembly.<br>
8.	The CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in<br>
spindle axis as claimed in claim 1, wherein the frame further<br>
comprises two parallel rails disposed along the lengthwise spindle<br>
direction, and wherein the tool holder assembly and the worktable<br>
assembly are provided with sliders to associate with the parallel rails<br><br>
for guiding the tool holder assembly and workable assembly to<br>
reciprocate along the lengthwise spindle axis direction.<br><br><br>
A CNC lathe with double-speed shifting feature in spindle axis<br>
comprises a frame, a screw rod pivotally disposed along a lenfthwise<br>
spindle axis of the frame, a worktable assembly and a tool holder assembly;<br>
characterized in that the screw rod includes a positive thread section and a<br>
counter thread section for engaging two nuts respectively secured on the<br>
worktable assembly and the tool holder assembly; thereby when the screw<br>
rod is rotated by a servomotor, the tool holder assembly and worktable<br>
assembly are simultaneously shifted in opposite directions along the spindle<br>
axis for obtaining a relatively shifting speed at the double of conventional<br>
one, so that the non-cutting operation time of a CNC lathe is greatly<br>
reduced, and so that the overall machining speed and efficiency are<br>
improved.<br></td>
