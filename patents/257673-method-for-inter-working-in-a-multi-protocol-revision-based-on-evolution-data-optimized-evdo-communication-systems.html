				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of mobile communication technology. The invention relates to EVDO and its evolved communication systems having multiple protocol revisions. It describes a system and method for efficiently operating in a system in which the access terminal is moving across access networks supporting different protocol revisions. More particularly, the invention relates to a system and method for inter-working in a multi protocol revision based EVDO communication systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The EVDO communication system consists of several protocols and applications which define the procedures to be followed by the access network (AN) and the access terminal (AT) to communicate with each other. Each protocol/application has several subtypes. A subtype of a protocol/application defines a distinct procedure to be used for the operation of that protocol/application. Each subtype of a protocol/application contains several configurable attributes which governs its operation. The EVDO communication system provides procedure to negotiate and configure the protocol/application subtypes and their corresponding attributes between the AT and AN. Configuration Request and Configuration Response messages are exchanged between AT and AN to negotiate protocol/application subtypes and their corresponding attributes.<br><br>
The set of negotiated and configured protocol/application subtypes and the corresponding attributes constitutes an EVDO session. In other words, an EVDO session refers to a shared state between the AT and the AN. This shared state stores the protocols/applications and the protocol/application configurations that were negotiated and are used for communications between the AT and the AN. Session configuration protocol (SCP) defines the procedure to negotiate and configure multiple EVDO sessions. These multiple EVDO sessions negotiated and configured by SCP are also referred to as multiple personalities. Each personality configured is identified by a personality index. At a given point of time only one personality will be in use between AT and AN. The personality index in use is stored in session configuration token (SCT).<br>
Each protocol/application can have two instances, InConfiguration and InUse instances. An InUse instance is the working instance of a protocol/application. At the time of power-up, EVDO session constitutes default set of Protocol and Application subtypes and also default values for attributes of these Protocols and Application subtypes. An InConfiguration instance of each protocol/application is created by SCP when the session negotiation is initiated. Once the session negotiation is complete, the configured values of the InConfiguration instances are stored by AT and AN at a given personality index. After configuring the multiple sessions, AN informs the AT about the session to be used using a configuration complete    or    soft    configuration    complete    message    (personality    index<br><br>
corresponding to the session to be used is encoded in session configuration token which is sent in configuration complete or soft configuration complete message).<br>
Session configuration can be initiated by AT or AN.<br>
A protocol revision defines a default set of protocol/application subtypes, which are used by AT until the session configuration. In the current EVDO system, only one default set of protocol/application subtype exists. At the time of Power Up, AT creates InUse Instances corresponding to this default set of protocol subtypes. AT's InUse instances are changed from the default to non-default subtypes only by session negotiation.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
■	In the current EVDO communication system only one default set of protocol/application subtypes exists. At power up the access terminal creates InUse instances corresponding to the default set of protocol/application subtypes. AT's InUse instances can be changed from default to non-default subtypes only by session negotiation.<br>
■	In a multi-protocol revisions system, there is need to have multiple default sets of protocols. So that the new deployments can directly operate on a system specific to a protocol revision without having to support all previous<br><br>
revisions of the system. Even AT's can be implemented only for some protocol revisions.<br>
■ In the current system there are no defined procedures for interworking in a system in which AT is moving across the ANs supporting different protocol revisions of the system.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art for techniques or mechanisms which will allow AT and AN to operate efficiently in a multi protocol revision system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current approach of configuring session in EVDO communication systems is modified such that in the systems with multiple protocol revisions, AT and AN can start their session negotiation with the subtypes corresponding to the highest protocol revision supported by AT and AN. In the special case of using default values for all the subtypes, session negotiation itself can be avoided. The invention also proposes a method to communicate between AT and AN about the protocol revisions supported by each.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for inter-working in a multi protocol revision based EVDO communication systems comprising the steps of:<br><br>
performing a session configuration by access terminal (AT) and access network (AN);<br>
maintaining a set by AT indicating all the protocol revisions said AT supports; and<br>
AT and AN performing session negotiation with the subtypes corresponding to a maximum protocol revision supported by AT and AN,<br>
wherein AT sends a Unicast Access Terminal Identifier (UATI) request message with protocol revisions using power up and idle handoff procedures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, it should be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore the details disclosed herein are not to be<br><br>
interpreted as limiting but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make or use the invention.<br>
In a system with multiple protocol revisions, the system defines different default sets of protocol/application subtypes corresponding to the each protocol revision that the system supports. This information can be used by AT and AN to perform an efficient session negotiation.<br>
AN transmits the information about the protocol revisions supported by it in a broadcast message. After acquiring the system AT gets the information about the protocol revisions supported by AN from the broadcast message transmitted by AN.<br>
When access terminal supports one or more protocol revisions of the system, it maintains a set indicating all the protocol revisions it supports. AT calculates the maximum protocol revision supported by AT and AN according to the following equation.<br>
max_supported_prev = Maximum ({Set of protocol revisions supported by both AT<br>
and AN})<br>
Where,<br>
{Set of protocol revisions supported by both AT and AN} =<br><br>
{Protocol revisions supported by AT}  (1 {Protocol revisions supported by AN}<br>
Equation 1 Maximum Protocol Revision Supported -<br>
AT also maintains a variable 'prev_in_use' which indicates the protocol revision which is being used by AT to communicate with the AN. During power up procedures AT sets 'prev_in_use' to 'max_supported_prev' and creates the InUse instances of the applications and protocol subtypes meant for the system corresponding to the prev_in_use. Then AT sends an UATI request message by including all the protocol revisions that it supports and the selected prev_in_use. Along with UATI request message AT also sends Session Configuration Token (SCT) being used by AT. SCT indicates whether AT is using a default or configured session. If AN has the knowledge about neighbour networks with different protocol revisions, AN can configure a separate personality for each protocol revision that both AT and AN supports as part of the session negotiation. This negotiation can be used by AT and AN during Handoff to neighbour networks.<br>
When AT receives new SCT after session negotiation/personality switch, it has to update the prev_in_use to a protocol revision corresponding to the personality index received in SCT.<br>
There are two scenarios in which AT sends the UATI request message with protocol revisions during 1.  Power up<br><br>
2.  Idle handoff to a system with different protocol revision<br>
Power Up Procedures-<br>
AT Procedures: When AT powers up it performs the following operations<br>
1.	It sets the 'prev_in_use' to NONE (a predefined value ex., OxFFFF).<br>
2.	It sets the Session Configuration Token to NONE (a predefined value ex., OxFFFF)<br>
3.	Obtains the AN supported protocol revisions by monitoring broadcast messages<br>
4.	AT calculates the max_supported_prev and sets prev_in_use = max_supported_prev<br>
5.	AT creates InUse instances of the protocols corresponding to the default set for 'prev_in_use'<br>
6.	AT sends UATI request message by including AT supported protocol revisions and 'prev_in_use'. As part of UATI request message transmission, SCT and RATI also get transmitted in the MAC header.<br>
AN Procedures:<br>
1. When AN receives UATI request message, it checks the SCT and RATI.<br>
a.	RATI indicates that AT is not having any configured session.<br>
b.	SCT ==  NONE,  indicates that AT is using default protocol set<br>
corresponding to prev_in_use.<br><br>
2. AN will initiate the session configuration.<br>
a.	AN  can configure multiple personalities,  corresponding to each<br>
protocol revision supported by AT<br>
b.	AN sets SCT to the personality to be used.<br>
Idle Handoff Procedures - When AT roams in a network, it performs idle handoffs across the cell boundaries and network boundaries. After idle handoff to a system/network with different protocol revision, AT obtains the protocol revisions supported by AN by monitoring broadcast messages and calculates the max_supported_prev by using Equation 1 above.<br>
There are different scenarios for these procedures. Detailed procedure for each scenario is explained below.<br>
Idle Handoff Scenario 1:<br>
AT has an established session with the old AN and has moved to a new AN. prev_in_use is supported by new AN and prev_in_use is equal to max_supported_prev between AT and new AN.<br>
AT Procedures:<br><br>
1. Send UATI request message with AT supported protocol revisions and prev_in_use. As part of UATI request message transmission, SCT and UATI also get transmitted in the MAC header.<br>

2.	UATI received in MAC header indicates that AT is having a session<br>
3.	SCT!= NONE, indicates that AT is using a personality corresponding to the personality index indicated by SCT.<br>
4.	AN will get the AT's session information from old AN.<br>
5.	AN will store the session information received from old AN<br>
6.	As AT is already using the personality corresponding to 'Max_Supported_Prev\ there is no need to switch personality.<br>
7.	However, AN may do a session configuration<br>
a.	To change some parameters of InUse personality and/or<br>
b.	To create a new personality corresponding to a protocol revision<br>
(supported by both AT and AN) which is not existing.<br>
8.	AN will send a session close and configure a new session if new AN is not<br>
able to retrieve AT's session information from old AN<br>
