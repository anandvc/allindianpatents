The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a printer and a copier utilizing electrophotographic method, and also relates to an image forming  method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In	an	image	forming	apparatus	utilizing<br>
electrophotographic method, an electrostatic latent image is formed on a photosensitive member and is developed by a developing device to form a toner image, which is first transferred to an intermediate transfer body and then transferred second and fixed to a recording medium such as paper. When performing full-color printing with such image forming apparatus, four toners of yellow, magenta, cyan and black are used. The toner images are first transferred to and superposed on an intermediate transfer body by a four-cycle system or a four-tandem system, and then secondly transferred and fixed to a recording medium (refer to the patent document  1-3, for example).<br>
In the four-cycle method, toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan and black are successively formed on one photosensitive member, and then first image transfers of the toner images to an intermediate transfer body are successively performed. Meanwhile, in the four-tandem method, a plurality of photosensitive members are prepared for forming  each  of the  toner  images  on  a  respective  one  of<br><br><br>
the photosensitive members, and first image transfers of the toner images to an intermediate transfer body are successively performed.<br>
However, in the image forming apparatuses utilizing such systems, even after transferring the toner images of the photosensitive members, the toners partly remain on the photosensitive member. The residual toner may be removed by a cleaning device, still, it is difficult to completely remove the toner. When image forming is performed using a photosensitive member with unduly remaining toner, flaws of black spots or image deletion may be caused. Especially when using the image forming apparatus repeatedly, fusion of the residual toner may occur, thereby constantly causing flaws in  images.<br>
Further, by repeatedly using the image forming apparatus, the surface condition (surface free energy) of the photosensitive member may be changed, and thus the adherence (work of adhesion) between the toner and the photosensitive member is changed. As a result, quality of the toner image transferred from the photosensitive member to the intermediate transfer body may get deteriorated with use of the image forming apparatus, so that flaws in images are likely to  be caused.<br>
Flaws in images largely affect the duration of guarantee of an image forming apparatus for forming images of a constant quality. Especially, when performing full-color   printing,    it    is    required   to    have    an    image    property<br><br><br>
higher than when performing black-and-white printing. Thus, the image forming apparatus for full-color printing is highly  required  to  prevent flaws  in  images  for a  long  period.<br>

DISCLOSURE   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to prevent undue adhesion or fusion of toner at a photosensitive member for enhancing quality of an image transferred to a transfer body, so that flaws in images are prevented and images of high quality are obtained for a long  period.<br>
The present invention attains the above object by focusing on the influence on the image property, which is exerted by the order of image transfer of toners to a transfer body as well as by the work of adhesion between toners  and  a  photosensitive  member.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising:<br>
one or a plurality of photosensitive members on which an<br>
electrostatic latent image is formed according to an image<br>
signal; a development mechanism for forming a toner image<br>
by developing the electrostatic latent images; and a<br>
transfer    body     for    transferring     the    toner     image.	The<br>
development mechanism includes a plurality of developing units   holding   different   kinds   of   toners.     A   second   work   of<br><br><br>
adhesion between the photosensitive member and a second toner to be transferred to the transfer body second is larger than a first and a third work of adhesions between the photosensitive member and a first and a third toners to be transferred to the transfer body first and  third.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming method comprising the steps of: forming an electrostatic latent image on one or a plurality of photosensitive members according to an image signal; forming a toner image by developing the electrostatic latent image using different kinds of toners; and transferring the toner image to a transfer body. The different kinds of toners are selected so that a second work of adhesion between the photosensitive member and a second toner to be transferred to the transfer body second is larger than a first and a third work of adhesions between the photosensitive member and a first and a third toners to be transferred to the transfer body first and third.<br>
Preferably, the second work of adhesion is not less than 102.0% and not more than 132.7% of the first work of adhesion. The third work of adhesion is not less than 79.9% and not more than 120.5% of the first work of adhesion.<br>
Preferably, the first work of adhesion is not less than 42.4mN/m and not more than 61.7 mN/m, the second work of adhesion is not less than 52.9 mN/m and not more than 64.5 mN/m,   and   the  third   work  of  adhesion   is   not   less  than  46.2<br><br><br>
mN/m  and  not  more than  61.7  mN/m.<br>
Preferably, the different kinds of toners include yellow, magenta, and cyan toners, and the second toner is one  of the yellow,   magenta,  and  cyan  toners.<br>
Preferably, the different kinds of toners further include a black toner, and the black toner is transferred to the transfer  body fourth.<br>
Preferably, the forming of the toner image on the photosensitive member and the transfer of the toner image to the transfer body are successively performed for each of the different kinds of the toners, and the toner images of the different kinds of the toners being superposed on the transfer body. Accordingly, the present invention may be applied to an image forming apparatus utilizing a multicycle system,  typically a four-cycle system.<br>
Preferably, the forming of the toner image on each of the plurality of photosensitive members is performed by a respective one of the different kinds of the toners, and then the transfer of the toner images of the different kinds of the toners are successively transferred to the transfer body, and the toner images of the different kinds of the toners being superposed on the transfer body. Accordingly, the present invention may be applied to an image forming apparatus utilizing a multi-tandem system, typically a four-tandem  system.<br>
Preferably, the photosensitive member is an amorphous silicon  photosensitive  member.<br><br><br>
In the present invention, the work of adhesion of the second toner to be transferred second (the second work of adhesion) is set to be larger than that of the toners which are to be transferred first and third (the first work of adhesion and the third work of adhesion). With such structure, undue adhesion or fusion of the toner at the electrophotographic photosensitive member is prevented, and thus quality of the toner image transferred to the transfer body is enhanced. As a result, in the present invention, images of high quality without flaws of black spots  or  image  deletion  are obtained  for a   long  period.<br>

BEST  MODE   FOR   CARRYING   OUT  THE   INVENTION <br>
An   image   forming   apparatus   according   to   the   present invention   is   specifically   described   below   with   reference   to the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, a first embodiment of the present invention is described with  reference to  Figs.   1-5.<br>
An image forming apparatus 1 shown in Fig. 1 utilizes<br>
a four-cycle system for full-color printing, and includes an<br>
electrophotographic        photosensitive        member        2,	an<br>
electrification mechanism 3, an exposure mechanism 4, a development mechanism 5, a transfer mechanism 6, a fixing mechanism 7, a cleaning mechanism 8, and a discharging mechan ism 9.<br><br><br>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 forms<br>
an electrostatic latent image or a toner image according to<br>
an image signal, and is rotatable in the direction of an<br>
arrow     A     in     the     figure.	As     shown      in      Fig.      2,     the<br>
electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 includes a cylindrical body 20 having a circumference on which an anti-carrier injection layer 21, a photocond uctive layer 22, and a surface  layer 23 are formed.<br>
Such  cylindrical  body  20  forms the  skeleton  of the electrophotographic  photosensitive  member 2,  and   is conductive  at  least  on  its  surface.    Specifically,  the cylindrical  body 20 may  be made of a conductive  material as a whole,  or may  be made of an  insulating  material  having a conductive  film  formed  thereon.    Preferably,  the  cylindrical body  is  formed  of Al  alloy  material  as  a  whole.    In  this  way, the electrophotographic  photosensitive  member 2   having  a light weight can  be made at a  low cost,  and further,  the adhesion  of the  cylindrical  body to the  anti-carrier  injection layer 21   and  the  photocond uctive  layer 22  is  reliably enhanced when  forming the layers  by amorphous silicon  (a-Si) material.<br>
The anti-carrier injection layer 21 prevents injection of carriers (electrons and electron holes) from the cylindrical body 20 into the ph otocond uctive layer 22, and is made of a-Si material, for example. Specifically, the anti-carrier injection layer 21 is made of a-Si material containing    boron    (B),    nitrogen    (N),    or    oxygen    (O)    as    a<br><br><br>
dopant,   and   has   a   thickness   of   not   less   than   2pm   and   not more-than  10pm.<br>
In forming the anti-carrier injection layer 21 using a-Si material, the material may contain a thirteenth group element or a fifteenth group element of the periodic system in an amount larger than those contained in a-Si material of the photoconductive layer 22 so as to determine the conductivity type. Further, a large amount of C, N, O may be also contained  so as to  have  high  resistivity.<br>
In the photoconductive layer 22, electrons are excited by a laser irradiation from the exposure mechanism 4 (see Fig. 1), and a carrier of free electrons or electron holes is generated. The photoconductive layer is formed of a-Si material or amorphous selenium material (a-Se), for example. As the a-Si material, a-Si, a-SiC, a-SiN, a-SiO, a-SiGe, a-SiCN, a-SiNO, a-SiCO or a-SiCNO may be used, while as the a-Se material, a-Se, Se-Te, and As2Se3 may be used. Especially when the photoconductive layer 22 is made of a-Si, it is able to have high luminous sensitivity, high-speed responsiveness, stable repeatability, high heat resistance, high endurance, and so on, thereby reliably obtaining enhanced electrophotographic property. When the anti-carrier injection layer 21 is made of a-Si material, adhesion of the photoconductive layer to the anti-carrier injection layer 21 is enhanced. In addition, by forming the surface layer 23 using a-SiC:H, conformity of the photoconductive      layer     with      the      surface      layer      23      is<br><br><br>
enhanced. The thickness of the photocon ducti ve layer 22 is set according to the photoconductive material and desired electrophotographic property. When the photoconductive layer 22 is made of a-Si material, the thickness is normally set to not less than 5pm and not more than 100pm, preferably,   not  less than   15pm  and  not  more than  80pm.<br>
The surface layer 23 for protecting the photoconductive layer 22 from friction and wear is laminated on the surface of the photoconductive layer 22. The surface layer 23 is formed of a-Si material such as amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and amorphous nitride silicon (a-SiN) or amorphous carbon (a-C), and has a thickness of not less than 0.2mm and not more than 1.5pm, for example.<br>
The electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 may<br>
include a long-wavelength light absorbing layer in place of<br>
the anti-charge injection layer 21, or in addition to the anti-<br>
charge injection layer 21.	The long-wavelength light<br>
absorbing layer prevents exposure light, which is long-<br>
wavelength light, from reflecting on the surface of the<br>
cylindrical body 20, and thus prevents a fringe pattern from<br>
being generated at a formed	image.	The<br>
electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 may further<br>
include, between the photoconductive layer 22 and the<br>
surface layer 23, a carrier excitation layer for enhancing<br>
luminance.<br>
The    electrification     mechanism     3     shown     in     Fig.     1<br><br><br>
constantly charges the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 positively or negatively, according to types of photocond uctive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2. The electrification potential at the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is normally set to not less than 200V and not more than 1000V.<br>
The  exposure  mechanism  4  forms  an  electrostatic latent image on  the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2,  and  is  capable  of emitting  laser  light,  for example.    The exposure  mechanism 4 forms an  electrostatic latent image on  the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2  by emitting  laser light on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 according to an image signal,  and  lowering the electrical  potential  at the emitted  portion.<br>
The development mechanism 5 forms a toner image by developing the electrostatic latent image formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, and is provided with a rotary holder 50 and developing units 51, 52,  53,   54.<br>
The rotary holder 50 supports the developing units 51, 52, 53, 54, and also selects one to be used from the developing units 51, 52, 53, 54. The rotary holder 50 is rotatable in the direction of an arrow B, and includes spaces 50A, 50B, 50C, 50D for accommodating the developing  units 51,  52,  53,  54.<br><br><br>
Each of the developing units 51, 52, 53, 54 develops (to make visible) an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2. The developing units 51, 52, 53, 54 hold toners 51A, 52A, 53A, 54A, and are provided with sleeves 55, 56, 57, 58, respectively.<br>
The toners 51A-54A are used to form toner images on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively. The toners 51A-54A are frictionally charged in the developing units 51-54. Each of the toners 51A-54A may be a binary developer of magnetic carrier and insulating toner, or a one-component developer of magnetic toner. The colors of the toners 51A-54A are not limited to yellow,   magenta,  cyan,  and  black.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in the development mechanism 5,<br>
by rotating the developing units 51-54 in the rotary holder<br>
50, a desired one of the developing units 51-54 is brought<br>
into contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive<br>
member 2 at a respective one of the sleeves 55-58. In this<br>
way,	the	electrostatic	latent	image	on	the<br>
electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is developed by a desired one of the developing units 51-54 (a toner of a desired  color).<br>
The transfer mechanism 6 transfers the toner image of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 on a recording   paper   P.      The   transfer   mechanism   6   includes   an<br><br><br>
intermediate   transfer   belt   60,   a   first   transfer   roller   61,   a second  transfer  roller 62,  and  a  cleaning  device  63.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 60 transfers the toner image of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, and is moved in the direction of arrows in the figure, by a driving   roller   64,   driven   rollers   65A,   65B,   a   tension   roller<br>
66,	and a  back-up roller 67.<br>
The first transfer roller 61 transfers the toner image of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 to the intermediate transfer belt 60. To the first transfer roller 61, e.g. a direct-current transfer voltage is applied for drawing the toner image on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 toward the first transfer roller 61. The intermediate transfer belt 60 passes through between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the first transfer roller 61, so that the toner image on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60 when a transfer voltage is applied to the first transfer roller 61.<br>
The second transfer roller 62 transfers the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 60 to a recording paper P. The intermediate transfer belt 60 passes through between   the   second   transfer   roller   and   the   back-up   roller<br>
67.	Similarly to the first transfer roller 61, to the second<br>
transfer roller 62 e.g. a direct-current transfer voltage is<br>
applied for drawing the toner image on the intermediate<br>
transfer   belt   60   toward   the   second   transfer   roller   62.     The<br><br><br>
recording paper P passes through between the intermediate transfer belt 60 and the second transfer roller 62, so that the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 60 is transferred to the recording paper P when a transfer voltage is  applied to the  second  transfer  roller 62.<br>
The  cleaning  device  63  removes the  toner  remaining on the  surface  of the  intermediate transfer  belt  60,  and includes a  cleaning  blade  63A.    In  the  cleaning  device  63, the toner remaining on the surface of the  intermediate transfer belt 60  is scraped off by the cleaning  blade 63A and  is collected.    The cleaning device 63  is  reciprocable  in the  direction  of arrows  C1,  C2  in  the  figure.    Except when scraping off the toner remaining  on the  intermediate transfer belt 60,  the cleaning  blade 63A is  retracted  away from the intermediate transfer belt 60.<br>
The fixing   mechanism  7  fixes the  toner  image transferred to the recording  paper P,  and  includes a  pair of fixing  rollers  70,  71.    In  the  fixing  mechanism  7,  the recording paper P passes through  between the fixing  rollers 70,  71,  so that the toner  image transferred  to  the  recording paper P  is fixed  on  the  recording   paper  P  by  heat  or pressure.<br>
The cleaning  mechanism 8  removes the toner remaining on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2,  and  includes a cleaning  blade 80. In the cleaning   mechanism  8,  the  toner  remaining  on  the surface  of the  electrophotographic  photosensitive  member 2<br><br><br>
is  scraped  off by  the  cleaning  blade  80  and  is  collected. The toner collected  in  the  cleaning  mechanism  8  is  recycled at the development  mechanism  5,   if necessary.<br>
The cleaning blade 80 is supported by an engaging means such as a spring in a manner so that its tip end is pressed onto the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2. The cleaning blade 80 is made of a rubber material mainly containing polyurethane resin, and its tip end brought into contact with the surface layer 23 has a thickness of not less than 1.0mm and not more than 1.2mm, a blade linear pressure of not less than 5gf/cm and not more than 30gf/cm, and a hardness of not less than 67 degrees and  not more than 84 degrees  (in  JIS  hardness).<br>
The  discharging  mechanism  9  removes  surface  charge on the  electrophotographic  photosensitive  member  2.    The discharging  mechanism  9  utilizes  e.g.   light  irradiation  for removing the surface charge of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2.<br>
Next, the operation of the image forming apparatus 1, or a method of image forming will  be described  below.<br>
Since the image forming apparatus 1 utilizes a fourcycle system, toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan and black are formed on the intermediate transfer belt 60 in a predetermined order, and these toner images are superposed on the intermediate transfer belt 60. Such superposition of the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt 60  is performed  in the following way.<br><br><br>
First, the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is constantly charged positively or negatively by the electrification mechanism 3, and then, according to an image signal, the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is exposed by the exposure mechanism 4 to form an electrostatic latent image. Next, the rotary holder 50 of the development mechanism 5 is rotated by 90 degrees (or is already rotated by 90 degrees in advance), and a desired one of the sleeves 55-58 of the developing units 51-54 is brought into contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, whereby the electrostatic latent image on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is developed to form a toner image. Subsequently, a transfer voltage is applied to the first transfer roller 61 so as to transfer the toner image of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60. Such electrification, exposure, development and first image transfer at the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is performed for each of the toners of yellow, magenta, cyan and black,  in  a  predetermined order.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in the image transfer to the intermediate transfer belt 60, the toner image of the black toner is transferred finally, while the order of image transfer of the other colors is not particularly limited. However, as can be seen from Fig. 4, the order of image transfer     of     yellow,     magenta,     and     cyan     toners     to     the<br><br><br>
electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is decided such that the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toner to be transferred second to the intermediate transfer belt 60 is larger than the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toners to  be transferred  first  and  third.<br>
Here, the work of adhesion depends on the surface free energy of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toner. In the image forming apparatus 1, the toner images of the yellow, magenta, and cyan toners are formed on the same electrophotographic photosensitive member 2. Thus, in the image forming apparatus 1, the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toners is substantially depends on the surface free energy of the toners. The surface free energy of the toners depends on the compositions of the toners. Therefore, in the image forming apparatus 1, the order of image transfer is decided according to the compositions of the yellow, magenta and cyan toners, or the compositions of the toners are decided according to the order of image transfer, so that the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toner to be transferred second is set to be larger than that between the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the toners to be transferred first and  third.<br><br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toner to be transferred second is not less than 102.0% and not more than 132.7% of that between the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the toner to be transferred first, and is not less than 52.9mN/m and not more than 64.5mN/m, for example. Further, the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the toner transferred to be third is not less than 79.9% and not more than 120.5% of that between the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the toner to be transferred first, and is not less than 46.2mN/m and not more than 61.7mN/m, for example.<br>
The work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the toner to be transferred first is not less than 42.4mN/m and not more than 61.7mN/m, for example, while the work of adhesion between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 and the black toner is not less than 37.7mN/m and not more than 68.5mN/m,  for example.<br>
Next, the operation of the development mechanism 5 will be simply described, taking the case, when the image transfer to the intermediate transfer belt 60 is performed in the order of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (as described at the top of Fig. 4), as an example. In this case, in the development mechanism 5, the cyan toner 51A, the magenta toner   52A,   the   yellow   toner   53A,   and   the   black   toner   54A<br><br><br>
are respectively accommodated in the developing units 51, 52, 53, and 54. First, as shown in Fig. 3A, the sleeve 55 of the developing unit 51 is brought into contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, and after electrification and exposure of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, development is performed by the cyan toner 51A whose toner image is transferred first to the intermediate transfer belt 60. Subsequently, for each of the magenta toner 52A, the yellow toner 53A, and the black toner 54A, in this order, the rotary holder is rotated by 90 degrees in the direction of the arrow B, and electrification, exposure, and development of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, as well as first image transfer to the  intermediate transfer  belt 60  are  performed.<br>
Finally, the toner images of cyan, magenta, yellow and black are superposed on the intermediate transfer belt 60, for forming a color toner image. Such color toner image is transferred to a recording paper P by applying transfer voltage to the second transfer roller 62, and then is fixed on the recording paper P by the fixing mechanism 7. In this way,  a color image  is formed on the  recording  paper P.<br>
In the image forming apparatus 1, the work of adhesion of the toner to be transferred second is set to be larger than that of the toners to be transferred first and third. With such structure, undue adhesion or fusion of the toner at the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is prevented,   and   thus  quality  of the  toner  images  transferred<br><br><br>
to the intermediate transfer belt 60 is enhanced. As a result, as will become apparent from the following embodiment, in the image forming apparatus 1, images of high quality without flaws of black spots or image deletion are obtained for a long period. The work of adhesion of the toners may be adjusted by changing the compositions of the toners.<br>
Of course, the data shown in Fig. 5 (the amounts and relative values of the work of adhesion) is only an example. In the present image forming apparatus 1, it suffices if the work of adhesion of the toner to be transferred second is set to be larger than that of the toners to be transferred first and third.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, the elements similar to those of the image forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1) already described are given the same reference numbers and duplicated description will be omitted.<br>
The image forming apparatus 1' illustrated in Fig. 6<br>
utilizes a four-cycle system, though differs from the image<br>
forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1) already described in the<br>
structure      of      the      development      mechanism      5'.	The<br>
development mechanism 5' utilizes a reverse system, and includes four developing units 51', 52', 53', 54'. The developing units 51'-54' are respectively provided with sleeves  55-58,  and  individually  reciprocable  in  the  direction<br><br><br>
of arrows  B1 ,   B2  in  the  figure.<br>
In the image forming apparatus 1', similarly to the image forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1), the work of adhesion of the toner to be transferred second is set to be larger than that of the toners to be transferred first and third. For example, when forming toner images of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black in this order, the cyan toner 51A, the magenta toner 52A, the yellow toner 53A, and the black toner 54A are respectively accommodated in the developing units 51', 52', 53', and 54'. The developing unit 51' (cyan) is first brought into contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, while the other developing units 52'-54' are retracted, so that a toner image of the cyan toner 51A in the developing unit 51' is formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2. Then, first image transfer of the toner image is performed to the intermediate transfer belt 60. Subsequently, the position of each the developing units 51'-54' is controlled and toner images of the developing units 52' (the magenta toner 52A), 53' (the yellow toner 53A), 54' (the black toner 54A) are formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2, and the toner images are successively transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60. In this way, each toner image of each color is superposed on the intermediate transfer belt 60 to form a color toner image. In second image transfer, this color toner image is transferred to the recording    paper    P,    and    then   fixed   thereon    by   the   fixing<br><br><br>
mechanism 7.<br>
Of course, the colors and compositions of the toners 51A-54A accommodated in the developing units 51'-54' may be changed variously, and the order of image transfer of the toners  may  be  variously  changed  as  shown   in   Fig.   4.<br>
In such image forming apparatus 1' of a four-cycle<br>
system with the development mechanism 5' utilizing a<br>
reverse system, a color toner image is formed on the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 60 by one electrophotographic<br>
photosensitive member 2. By changing the compositions of<br>
the toners, the work of adhesion of the toner to be<br>
transferred second is set to be larger than that of the<br>
toners    to     be     transferred     first     and     third.	With     such<br>
structure, in the image forming apparatus V, similarly to the image forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1), undue adhesion or fusion of the toner at the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 2 is prevented, and thus quality of the toner images transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60 is enhanced. As a result, images of high quality without flaws of black spots or image deletion are obtained for a  long  period.<br>
Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the elements similar to those of the image forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1) already described are given the same reference numbers  and  duplicated  description  will  be  omitted.<br>
The  image  forming  apparatus   1"   utilizes  a  four-tandem<br><br><br>
system. The image forming apparatus 1" is provided with four electrophotographic photosensitive members 24", 25", 26", 27", and the electrophotographic photosensitive members 24 "-27" are respectively provided with exposure mechanisms 41", 42", 43", 44", developing units 51 "-54", and first transfer rollers 61A", 61B", 61C", 61D". Though omitted in the figure, each of the electrophotographic photosensitive members 24 "-27" is also individually provided with an electrification mechanism, a discharge mechanism,  and  a cleaning  mechanism.<br>
In the image forming apparatus 1", each of the<br>
developing units 51 "-54" accommodates a toner of desired<br>
color    and     composition.	The     developing     units     51 "-54"<br>
respectively form toner images on the electrophotographic photosensitive members 24", 25", 26", 27", and the toner images are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60. For example, in the image forming apparatus 1", when toner images are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60 in the order of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, the cyan toner 51A, the magenta toner 52A, the yellow toner 53A, the black toner 54A are respectively accommodated in the developing units 51", 52", 53", and 54". In this case, a cyan toner image, a magenta toner image, a yellow toner image, and a black toner image are respectively formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 24", 25", 2 6",  and  2 7".<br>
Meanwhile,     in     a     first     transfer     area     60"     of     the<br><br><br>
intermediate transfer belt 60, the developing unit 51" (the cyan toner 51A), the developing unit 52" (the magenta toner 52A), the developing unit 53" (the yellow toner 53A), and the developing unit 54" (the black toner 54A) are arranged in this order from the upper stream side of the moving direction of the intermediate transfer belt 60. Thus, in the first transfer area 60", toner images of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are respectively formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 24", 25", 26", and 27"  in the  mentioned  order.<br>
Also     in     such     image     forming     apparatus     1",     when<br>
transferring	images	of	the	electrophotographic<br>
photosensitive members 24"-27" to the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 60, the work of adhesion of the toner to be transferred<br>
second is set to be larger than that of the toners to be<br>
transferred first and third. Further, in the image forming<br>
apparatus 1", since the developing units 51 "-54"<br>
respectively correspond to the electrophotographic<br>
photosensitive members 24"-27", in addition to compositions<br>
of        toners,	the        surface        free        energy        of        the<br>
electrophotographic photosensitive members 24"-27" may be controlled, so that the work of adhesion of the toner to be transferred second is set to be larger than that of the toners to be transferred first and third. The surface free energy of the electrophotographic photosensitive members 24"-27" is controlled by changing the states of irregularities on     the     surfaces     (surface     roughness)     or     the     surface<br><br><br>
compositions     of     the     electrophotographic     photosensitive members 24"-27".<br>
Of course, the colors and compositions of the toners 51A-54A accommodated in the developing units 51 "-54" may be changed variously, and the order of image transfer of the toners  may  be variously  changed  as  shown   in  Fig.  4.<br>
With such image forming apparatus 1" utilizing a four-tandem system, similarly to the image forming apparatus 1 (see Fig. 1), undue adhesion or fusion of the toner at the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive members 24"-27" is prevented, and thus quality of the toner image transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 60 is enhanced. As a result, images of high quality without flaws of black spots  or  image  deletion  are  obtained  for a  long   period.<br>
In the above-described first to third embodiments, the toner images of the electrophotographic photosensitive members 2, 24"-27" of the image forming apparatuses 1 , 1', 1" are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt. However, the present invention may also be applied to an image forming apparatus in which the toner images of the electrophotographic photosensitive members 2, 24"-27" are directly transferred to the  recording  paper P.<br>
[Example  1 ]<br>
In the present example, it was studied how the composition (work of adhesion) of toners and the order of image transfer to an intermediate transfer body affect the image    property    of    images    printed    by    the    image    forming<br><br><br>
apparatus  1   shown   in   Fig.   1.<br>
(Manufacture  of Photosensitive  Member)<br>
As       the        photosensitive        member        2,        an        a-Si<br>
photosensitive     member     was     used.	The     photosensitive<br>
member 2 included a cylindrical body 20 prepared by making a drawn tube of aluminum alloy with outer diameter of 30mma, length of 340mm and thickness of 1.5mm, and then performing mirror finishing on the circumferential outer surface of the drawn tube before cleaning. The cylindrical body was incorporated in a glow discharge decomposition device, and the anti-charge injection layer 21, the photoconductive layer 22, and the surface layer 23 were formed under the film forming conditions shown in the following Table  1 .<br>

The following Table 2 indicates toners used in the example. The work of adhesion was measured by a contact angle meter CX-ROLL and a surface free energy analysis software EG-11 manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co.,  Ltd.      Specifically,   using   the   contact   angle   meter   CX-<br><br><br>
ROLL manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd., a liquid (containing dispersion force component, dipole component, and hydrogen bond component, each with known surface free energy value; such as water, ethylene glycol, and methylene iodide), was dropped, and its contact angle at a toner pellet was measured utilizing drop method, in a room under a controlled temperature of 20-24°C, thereby analyzing the surface free energy of the toner. The toner pellet was formed into a cylinder with a diameter of 5mm and a height of 10mm. Subsequently, using the data of the surface free energy of the toner, the work of adhesion was calculated based on extended Fowkes theory. Table  2<br><br><br>
