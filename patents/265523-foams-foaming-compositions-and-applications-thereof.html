				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
FOAMS, FOAMING COMPOSITIONS AND APPLICATIONS THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to foams, foaming compositions, and applications thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to foams having a low specific gravity, a small compression set (CS) and in a preferred mode a uniform quality, and to applications of the foams. Moreover, the present invention relates to compositions capable of providing foams having a low specific gravity, a small compression set (CS) and preferably a uniform quality.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Crosslinked foams have a low specific gravity, namely are lightweight, and have flexibility and high mechanical strength. They have been widely used for interior and exterior materials of construction, automobile components such as interior materials and aoor glass run channels, packaging materials, and daily necessities. Merely foaming a resin provides lightweight but results in a foam having low mechanical strength. It is thus publicly known that<br>
molecular chains in the foam are linked to each other by crosslinking reaction of the resin to prevent mechanical strength from being decreased. [0003]<br>
Crosslinked foams made of resin find use in footwear and footwear components such as shoe soles (mainly mid soles) of sport shoes and the like. The reason for this use is that footwear and footwear components are required to meet conditions such as lightness in weight, resistance to deformation by long use, and mechanical strength and impact resilience to withstand use under severe conditions. [0004]<br>
It is widely known that crosslinked foams made of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers have been used for shoe soles. However, crosslinked foams molded from compositions of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers have a high specific gravity and a large compression set. In the case in which the crosslinked foam is used for a shoe sole, the shoe sole is heavy and is compressed after long use, and mechanical strength such as impact resilience is decreased disadvantageously. ;0005]<br>
Patent documents 1 and 2 describe a crosslinked foam using an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer and a crosslinked foam using a mixture of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and an ethylene/α-olefin<br>
copolymer, respectively. These inventions improve low specific gravity and compression set. However, a satisfactory performance cannot be obtained. [0006]<br>
Patent document 3 describes an ethylene/α-olefin/specified non-conjugated polyene random copolymer. However, a study by the present inventors has found that there is room for improvement in terms of providing a foam having a low specific gravity, a small compression set (CS) and a uniform quality. [0007]<br>
Patent document 4 describes an olefin crosslinked foam and a composition therefor. However, a study by the present inventors has found that there is room for improvement in terms of providing a foam having a lower specific gravity and a smaller compression set. [0008]<br>
Patent document 5 describes an elastomer composition for a crosslinked foam and applications thereof. However, a study by the present inventors has found that there is room for improvement in terms of providing a foam having a low specific gravity and a small compression set (CS) .<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 0030]<br>
The foams, foaming compositions and applications thereof according to the present invention will be described below in detail. 0031]<br>
The foam according to the present invention can be obtained from an olefin polymer, preferably from a foaming composition. I 0032]<br>
The foam according to the present invention is obtained by at<br>
least foaming an olefin polymer or a foaming composition. The foam is generally crosslinked. However, it is not always necessary that the foam is crosslinked. Hereafter, foams that are crosslinked will be referred to as crosslinked foams, and foams that are not crosslinked will be referred to as non crosslinked foams.<br>
[0033]<br>
The ethylene polymer composition according to the present<br>
invention includes:<br>
(A)	an ethylene polymer and<br>
(B)	an  ethylene/C3-20  a-olefin/non-conjugated  polyene<br>
copolymer, and if necessary:<br>
(C)	a foaming agent,<br>
(D)	a radical generator, and<br>
(E)	a crosslinking assistant.<br>
;0034]<br>
The above component (A) includes: (Al) an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer and (A2) an ethylene/polar monomer copolymer, wherein (Al) 'and (B) satisfy the specified requirements (al), (a2),<br>
(bl), (b2), and (b3) described later.<br>
[0035]<br>
More specifically, the ethylene polymer composition according<br>
to the present invention includes:<br>
(A) an ethylene polymer in an amount of more than 80 mass% to<br>
99 mass%, the ethylene polymer including:<br>
(Al) an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer that satisfies (al) and (a2) described later; and<br>
(A2) an ethylene/polar monomer copolymer in a mass ratio of (A1)/(A2) = 100/0 to 20/80; and<br>
(B) an ethylene/C3-20 α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene copolymer in an amount of 1 mass% to less than 20 mass% (the sum of (A) and (B) is 100mass%), which copolymer satisfies (bl) , (b2) and Jb3) described later. [0036] <foam><br>
The foam according to the present invention satisfies the following (i) and (ii), and preferably (iii) and/or (iv). I 0037]<br>
(i) The specific gravity (d) is in the range of 0.03 to 0.30, preferably in the range of 0. 05 to 0 .20, more preferably in the range of 0.05 to 0.12, further preferably in the range of 0.08 to 0.12. The specific gravity within the upper limit gives good impact resilience and is preferable in terms of weight reduction of the foam. The specific gravity not less than the lower limit promises sufficient strength and good durability of the foam. The uniformity of quality of the foam is measured based on specific gravity at five points of the foam. In the invention, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the five points is preferably not more than 0.08,<br>
more preferably not more than 0.06. [0038]<br>
(ii) It is preferable that the compression set (CS, %) and the specific gravity (d) satisfy the following formula. J0039]<br>
CS 
When CS is not more than -279 x (d) + 95, the foam shows good relaxation of compression stress. Such foam is effective for applications that require permanent set resistance. [0040]<br>
Although the satisfaction of the above formula is desirable, the compression set (CS) of the foam is preferably 10% or higher, more preferably 25% or higher. [0041]<br>
(iii) It is preferable that the impact resilience is 30% or higher, more preferably 40% or higher. The foam with high impact resilience has a soft touch sense and shows excellent cushioning properties when used in footwear. [0042]<br>
(iv) It is preferable that the tearing strength of the foam measured according to ASTM D3574 is from 1.5 N/mm to 5.0 N/mm, more preferably from 2.0 N/mm to 4.5 N/mm. With this tearing strength, the foam may be bonded to other members to achieve sufficient bond strength.<br>
[0043]<br>
Here, the above physical properties are measured as follows. [0044] (i) Specific gravity<br>
The specific gravity was measured according to JIS K7222. In the case of a cube foam, a sample is sampled from an area that is found at least 20 mm inward from the four sides of the largest plane and at least 2.5 mm deep from the surface of the plane and the surface of a plane parallel thereto. This sampling location applies to sample foams with other various shapes. Specifically, a sample is sampled from an area that is found at least 20 mm inward from the edges (sides) of the opposed largest planes as upper and lower surfaces and at least 2.5 mm deep from the upper and lower surfaces. 10045]<br>
In the case in which the foam is used for a mid sole, a sample is prepared from an area found at least 20 mm inward from the edges and at least 2.5 mm deep from the approximately parallel planes. !004 6]<br>
The specific gravity is measured at five points in the foam and the results are averaged. The specific gravity at five points of the foam determines the uniformity of quality of the foam. In the invention, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the five points is preferably not more than 0.08, more preferably not more than 0.06. The difference by more than 0.08 means that the<br>
quality of the product (e.g., hardness, mechanical properties and compression set) is not uniform. Fig. 1 shows five points for measurement. 10047] ;ii) Compression set (CS)<br>
The compression set (CS) is measured according to JIS K6262. A foam is cut in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of at least 15 mm, and a sample is prepared by cutting the cylinder to a thickness of 10 mm by eliminating at least 2.5 mm from the two parallel faces of the cylinder. 0048]<br>
This sample preparation applies to sample foams with other various shapes. Specifically, a foam is cut in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of at least 15 mm, and a sample is prepared by cutting the cylinder to a thickness of 10 mm by eliminating at least 2.5 mm from the two parallel faces of the cylinder. L0049]<br>
A cylindrically hollow dumbbell implement may be used for cutting the foam in a cylindrical shape or for sampling the sample from under the parallel planes of the foam. <br>
[0050]<br>
The sample is left at rest in the environment of 50% compression and 50°C for 6 hours. The thickness is measured 30 minutes after the<br>
sample is released from the compression. The compression set (CS)<br>
is calculated by the following formula.<br>
[0051]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
to: Initial sample thickness (mm)<br>
t1: Thickness (mm) measured 30 minutes after the sample is removed from compression apparatus t2: Spacer thickness (mm) (iii) Impact resilience<br>
The impact resilience was measured according to JIS K6255. A sample is prepared by the same method as used in the above (2) Compression set (CS). The impact resilience was measured in the atmosphere of 23°C. 10052] (iv) Tearing strength<br>
The tearing strength was measured according to ASTM D3574 in the environment of 23°C. A tensile tester is used as a testing machine, and the stress rate is 100 mm/min. The tearing strength Tr (N/mm) is calculated by the following formula. [0053]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
α-tO: Tearing stress (kg) t1: Sample width (mm)<br>
The foam according to the present invention can be obtained<br>
by foaming an olefin polymer. [0054]<br>
The olefin polymer according to the present invention is at least one polymer which includes constitutional units derived from an a-olefin of 2 to 20 carbon atoms. "0055]<br>
The polymer including constitutional units derived from a C2-20 α-olefin is not particularly limited. For instance, the polymer may be an ethylene/C3-20 α-olefin copolymer, or may be an ethylene/C3-20 α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene copolymer. Moreover, the polymer may be a copolymer of a C2-20 α-olefin and a polar monomer. The polymer may be a mixture of a plurality of polymers. 10056]<br>
Preferable examples of the ethylene/C3-20 α-olefin copolymers include the ethylene polymer (Al) . Preferable examples of the C2-20 α-olefin/polar monomer copolymers include the ethylene/polar monomer copolymer (A2). Preferable examples of the ethylene/C3-20 α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene copolymers include the ethylene/polar monomer copolymer (B) . [0057]<br>

When the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (Al) has this molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn), the composition can give a foam excellent in compression set and shaping properties.

[0073]<br>
I Chemical formula 1]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0074]<br>
The Taf3/Taa intensity ratio can be obtained as described below. A 13C-NMR spectrum of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is measured using JEOL-GX270 NMR measuring apparatus manufactured by JEOL, Ltd. The measurement is carried out using a 5 mass% solution of a sample in hexachlorobutadiene/d6-benzene = 2/1 (volume ratio), at 67.8 MHz and 25°C with d6-benzene (128 ppm) as standard. The measured 13C-NMR spectrum is analyzed according to a proposal of Lindemann Adams<br>
Analysis Chemistry 43, pl245 (1971)) and J. C. Randall (Review Macromolecular Chemistry Physics, C29, 201 (1989) ) to obtain a Ta(3/Taa intensity ratio.<br>
10075]<br>
For the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (Al) according to the present invention, (a7) the B value obtained from a 13C-NMR spectrum and the following general formula (1) is generally in the range of 0.9 to 1.5, preferably in the range of 0.95 to 1.2.<br>
[0076]<br>
B value = [POE] / (2 • [PE] [PO])...(l) wherein [PE] represents a mole fraction of the constitutional units derived from ethylene in the copolymer, [PO] represents a mole fraction of the constitutional units derived from the a-olefin in the copolymer, and [POE] represents a proportion of the number of ethylene/α-olefin chains to the total dyad chains in the copolymer. The B value is an index that indicates a distribution state of ethylene and the C3-20 α-olefin in the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, and can be obtained based on the reports of J. C. Randall (Macromolecules, 15, 353 (1982) ) and J. Ray (Macromolecules, 10, 773 (1977)) . 10077]<br>
The B value of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (Al) is generally determined by measuring a 13C-NMR spectrum of a sample in which approximately 200 mg of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is uniformly dissolved in 1 ml of hexachlorobutadiene, in a sample tube with a diameter of 10 mm under the measuring conditions of a measuring temperature of 120°C, a measuring frequency of 25.05 MHz, a spectral bandwidth of 1500 Hz, a pulse repetition period of 4.2 sec, and a pulse width of 6 usee. i0078]<br>
As the B value is larger, block chains of ethylene or the O'-olefin copolymer are shorter, the distribution of ethylene and the c
copolymer rubber is smaller. As the B value is smaller than 1.0, the composition distribution of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is larger, and handling properties are deteriorated in some cases. 0079]<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (Al) described above can be manufactured by a publicly known method using a vanadium catalyst, a titanium catalyst, a metallocene catalyst or the like.

When the ratio (Et/a) is in the above range, the obtainable polymer composition shows excellent processability and weathering resistance and has appropriate flexibility. 10105] (b2) Iodine value<br>
The iodine value used herein refers to a number of grams (g/100 g) of iodine absorbed in 100 g of the<br>
ethylene/α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene random copolymer (B) . The iodine value is an index for the degree of unsaturation of the ethylene/α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene random copolymer (B). A larger iodine value means that the degree of unsaturation is higher. [0106]<br>

aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methanol, ethanol, propane, butane, pentane and hexane;<br>
chlorohydrocarbons such as dichloroethane, dichloromethane and carbon tetrachloride;<br>
organic physical foaming agents such as fluorochlorohydrocarbons such as chlorofluorocarbon; and<br>
inorganic physical foaming agents such as air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon and water. Among them, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon are most preferable because they do not need to be vaporized,<br>
are inexpensive and are very unlikely to cause environmental pollution and ignition. [0113]<br>
The physical foaming agent as the foaming agent (C) does not produce a decomposition residue of the foaming agent, and the composition can be crosslinked and foamed without contamination of a mold. Moreover, the physical foaming agent is not powdery and therefore has excellent kneading properties. The use of the physical foaming agent prevents a foreign odor of the obtainable foam (such as an ammonia odor generated in the decomposition of ADCA). 011.4]<br>
Such foaming agents (C) may be used in combination with the chemical foaming agents without causing adverse effects such as odor and mold contamination. [0115 ]<br>
If the production scale is small, the physical foaming agent such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen may be stored in a cylinder and may be supplied through a pressure reducing valve to an injection molding machine or an extrusion machine. In some cases, the physical foaming agent may be pressurized by a pump or the like and may be supplied to an injection molding machine or an extrusion machine. 0116]<br>
In facility for large scale production of foams, a storage tank of liquefied carbon dioxide or liquefied nitrogen may be installed.<br>
The foaming agent may be vaporized through a heat exchanger and may be supplied through pipes and a pressure reducing valve to an injection molding machine or an extrusion machine. ;0117]<br>
In the case of liquid physical foaming agents, the storage pressure is preferably in the range of 0.13 to 100 MPa. r0118]<br>
The chemical foaming agent (C) is generally used in an amount of 2 to 30 parts by mass, preferably 3 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably 5 to 15 parts by mass relative to the total 100 parts by mass of the olefin polymers. For instance, in the case in which the olefin polymer is the ethylene polymer composition, the chemical foaming agent is generally used in an amount of 2 to 30 parts by mass, preferably 3 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably 5 to 15 parts by mass relative to the total 100 parts by mass of the ethylene polymer (A) and the ethylene/α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene copolymer (B) . The amount of the chemical foaming agent may be increased or decreased as required depending on an objective foaming ratio because the amount of gas generated depends on a kind and a grade of the foaming agent used. [0119]<br>

[0125] <method for manufacturing foam><br>
The foam according to the present invention may be manufactured by, for example, the following method from the olefin polymer optionally together with (C) the foaming agent, (D) the radical generator, (E) the crosslinking assistant and various additives such as a filler, a heat stabilizer, a weathering stabilizer, a flame retardant, a hydrochloric acid absorber and a pigment (these may be added while still achieving the objects of the present invention). (Hereinbelow, the olefin polymer and the optional components may be collectively referred to as the components including the olefin polymer. ) However, the manufacturing method is not restricted to the exemplary method described below. The olefin polymer is preferably the ethylene polymer composition described above. <br>
[0126]<br>
The ethylene polymer composition that is a preferable<br>
embodiment of the olefin polymer according to the present invention includes the ethylene polymer (A) in an amount of more than 80 mass% to 99 mass% which polymer includes the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (A1) that satisfies (a1) and (a2) and the ethylene/polar monomer copolymer (A2) in a mass ratio of (A1)/(A2) = 100/0 to 20/80; and the ethylene/C3-20 α-olef in/non-conjugated polyene copolymer (B) in an amount of 1 mass% to less than 20 mass% (the sum of (A) and (B) is 100 mass%), which copolymer satisfies (b1), (b2) and (b3). [0127]<br>
The olefin polymer, preferably the ethylene polymer composition, used in the invention is in an uncrosslinked and unfoamed state, and may be in a molten state or may be in the form of pellets or sheet solidified by cooling. [0128]<br>
Pellets of the components including the olefin polymer, preferably pellets of the ethylene polymer composition, may be produced as follows. The olefin polymer (preferably the ethylene polymer (A) and the ethylene/α-olefin/non-conjugated polyene copolymer (B)) and optionally the foaming agent (C), the radical generator (D) , the crosslinking assistant (E) and foaming assistant are mixed with a Henschel mixer in the above-mentioned ratio. The mixture is molten and plasticized with a kneading machine such as a Banbury mixer, a roll or an extrusion machine at a temperature at which the foaming agent (C) and/or the radical generator (D) will<br>
not be decomposed. The components are mixed and dispersed uniformly and then pelletized with a pelletizer. Examples of the methods for crosslinking and foaming include crosslinking by heat treatment and crosslinking with an ionizing radiation as will be described later. In the case of crosslinking by heat treatment, the composition preferably includes the radical generator (D) and the crosslinking assistant (E) . In the case of crosslinking with an ionizing radiation, the crosslinking assistant may be added. [0129]<br>
The olefin polymer may be optionally used together with (C) the foaming agent, (D) the radical generator, (E) the crosslinking assistant and, as needed, many kinds of additives such as a filler, a heat stabilizer, a weathering stabilizer, a flame retardant, a hydrochloric acid absorber and a pigment while still achieving the objects of the invention.<br>
In particular, in addition to the above components, many kinds of additives such as a filler, a heat stabilizer, a weathering stabilizer, a flame retardant, a hydrochloric acid absorber and a pigment may be compounded in the ethylene polymer composition as reguired while still achieving the objects of the invention. 10130]<br>
A sheet of the components including the olefin polymer, preferably a sheet of the ethylene polymer composition, may be prepared from the pellets using an extruder or a calendering machine.<br>
Alternatively, the components including the olefin polymer, preferably the components of the ethylene polymer composition, may be kneaded with a Brabender mixer or the like, and the mixture may be formed into a sheet with a calender roll or a press molding machine. Still alternatively, the components may be kneaded with an extruder and the mixture may be formed into a sheet through a T-die or a ring die. By these methods, foamable sheets in an uncrosslinked and unfoamed state can be prepared. ;0131] [Preparation of foam]<br>
Methods for manufacturing the foam (uncrosslinked or crosslinked) according to the present invention are not particularly limited. For example, the foam may be prepared by the following method. [0132]<br>
For instance, a sheet including the olefin polymer may be obtained using a calendering machine, a press molding machine or a T-die extruder. Preferably, a sheet of the ethylene polymer composition may be obtained using a calendering machine, a press molding machine or a T-die extruder. The sheet is preferably formed at temperatures not more than decomposition temperatures of the foaming agent (C) and the organic peroxide (D) as the radical generator. More specifically, it is preferable that the sheet is formed under conditions such that the components including the olefin<br>
polymer in the molten state are at 100 to 130°C. In the case in which the olefin polymer is the ethylene polymer composition, it is also preferable that the sheet is formed under conditions such that the molten ethylene polymer composition is at 100 to 130°C. [0133]<br>
An exemplary method for manufacturing a primary foam from the sheet obtained by the above method will be described. The sheet is cut to a size in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 relative to a volume of a mold, and is inserted in the mold held at 130 to 200°C. A primary foam (an uncrosslinked or crosslinked foam) is prepared under the conditions in which the mold clamping pressure is in the range of 30 to 300 kgf/cm2 and the retention time is in the range of 10 to 90 minutes. That is, the foam (uncrosslinked or crosslinked foam) is prepared by heat treatment. Because the retention time depends on the mold thickness, the retention time may be increased or decreased outside the above range, i0134]<br>
Shapes of the mold for producing the (crosslinked) foam are not particularly limited. The mold usually has a shape such that a sheet will be obtained. It is preferable that the mold has a structure capable of being completely sealed to prevent the leakage of the molten resin and a gas generated by decomposition of the foaming agent The mold preferably has a tapered inner surface to permit easy release of the resin.<br>
[0135]<br>
In addition to the above method, the components including the olefin polymer, preferably the ethylene polymer composition, may be extruded with an extrusion machine and may be foamed as soon as the resin is released in the atmosphere. This extrusion foaming method also produces the foam according to the present invention. That is, the foam can be manufactured by heat treatment. [0136]<br>
Alternatively, the components including the olefin polymer, preferably the ethylene polymer composition, may be injected in a mold at not more than decomposition temperatures of the foaming agent !C) and the radical generator (D) , and the resin may be crosslinked and foamed in the mold at temperatures kept in the range of, for example, about 130 to 200°C (injection foaming method) . That is, the foam may be manufactured by heat treatment. [0137]<br>
The primary foam obtained by the above method is given a predetermined shape by compression molding. As an example of compression molding conditions, the mold temperature is in the range of 130 to 200°C, the mold clamping pressure is in the range of 30 to 300 kgf/cm2, the compression time is in the range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the compression ratio is in the range of 1.1 to 3.0, preferably in the range of 1.3 to 2. [0138]<br>
Production of a crosslinked foam by crosslinking by application of an ionizing radiation will be described. The olefin polymer (preferably the ethylene polymer (A) and the ethylene/α-olef in/non-conjugated polyene copolymer (B) ) , anorganic heat decomposable foaming agent as the foaming agent (C), and additives are melt-kneaded at a temperature less than a decomposition temperature of the organic heat decomposable foaming agent. The resultant kneaded product is then formed into a sheet to give a sheet foam. 10139]<br>
The sheet foam is irradiated with an ionizing radiation at a predetermined dose and is crosslinked. The crosslinked sheet foam is heated to at least the decomposition temperature of the organic heat decomposable foaming agent and the sheet is foamed, giving a crosslinked sheet foam. That is, the foam may be manufactured by heat treatment. :0140]<br>
Examples of the ionizing radiations include a rays, p rays,<br>
Y	rays, electron rays, neutron.rays and X rays. Among them, cobalt-60<br>
Y	rays and electron rays are preferably used.<br>
10141]<br>
Exemplary shapes of the foam include sheets, thick boards, nets and moldable shapes. [0142]<br>
The crosslinked foam obtained as described above is given a predetermined shape by compression molding, and thereby a secondary foam is manufactured. As an example of compression molding conditions, the mold temperature is in the range of 130 to 200°C, the mold clamping pressure is in the range of 30 to 300 kgf/cm2, the compression time is in the range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the compression ratio is in the range of 1.1 to 3.0. [0143]<br>
Among the above manufacturing methods, it is preferable that the foam is obtained by heat treating the components including the olefin polymer (preferably the ethylene polymer composition). j 0144]<br>

In the foam obtained by foaming the ethylene polymer composition, the compression set 'CS, %) and the specific gravity (d) are not particularly limited. However, it is preferable that the compression set (CS, %) and the specific gravity (d) satisfy CS ^ -279 x (d) + 95. The foam satisfying this condition is lightweight and has small compression set. The foam in this embodiment may be suitably used for a laminate, footwear and footwear components described below. [014 5] <laminate><br>
A laminate according to the present invention includes a layer of the foam (uncrosslinked or crosslinked foam) according to the present invention and a layer made of at least one material selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyurethane, rubber, leather and synthetic leather. [0146]<br>
The polyolefin, polyurethane, rubber, leather and synthetic leather are not particularly limited. Known polyolefins, polyurethanes, rubbers, leather and synthetic leather may be used. The laminate is suitable for use in footwear and footwear components m particular. [0147] <footwear and footwear components><br>
Footwear and footwear components according to the present invention include the foam (uncrosslinked or crosslinked foam) or the laminate according to the present invention. Examples of the footwear components include shoe soles, mid soles, inner soles, soles and sandals. [0148]<br>

The density was measured at 23°C according to ASTM D1505. [0151] 12) MFR<br>
MFR was measured at 190°C according to ASTM D1238. A value measured at a load of 2 .16 kg is expressed as MFR2, and a value measured at a load of 10 kg is expressed as MFR10. : 0152] (3) B value and Tap intensity ratio<br>
The B value and the Tap intensity ratio were measured using JEOL-GX270 NMR measuring apparatus manufactured by JEOL, Ltd. The measurement was carried out using a 5 mass% solution of a sample in hexachlorobutadiene/d6-benzene = 2/1 (volume ratio) , at 67 . 8 MHz and 25°C, and with d6-benzene (128 ppm) as standard. The recorded 13C-NMR spectrum was analyzed according to a proposal of Lindemann Adams Analysis Chemistry 43, p145 (1971)) and J. C. Randall (Review<br>

(i) Specific gravity<br>
The specific gravity was measured according to JIS K7222. In<br>
the case of a cube foam, a sample was sampled from an area that was found at least 20 mm inward from the four sides of the largest plane and at least 2.5 mm deep from the surface of the plane and from the surface of a plane parallel thereto. This sampling location applied to sample foams with other various shapes. Specifically, a sample was sampled from an area that was found at least 20 mm inward from the edges (sides) of the opposed largest planes as upper and lower surfaces and at least 2.5 mm deep from the upper and lower surfaces. [0155]<br>
In the case in which the foam was to be used for a mid sole, a sample was prepared from an area found at least 20 mm inward from the edges and at least 2.5 mm deep from the approximately parallel planes. [0156]<br>
The specific gravity was measured at five points in the foam and the results were averaged. The specific gravity at five points of the foam determines the uniformity of quality of the foam. The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the five points is preferably not more than 0.08, more preferably not more than 0.06. The difference by more than 0 . 08 means that the quality of the product (e.g., hardness, mechanical properties and compression set) is not uniform. Fig. 1 shows five points for measurement. [0157] (ii) Compression set (CS)<br>
The compression set (CS) was measured according to JIS K6262. A foam was cut in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of at least 15 mm, and a sample was prepared by cutting the cylinder to a thickness of 10 mm by eliminating at least 2.5 mm from the two parallel faces of the cylinder. [0158]<br>

Specifically, a foam was cut in a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of at least 15 mm, and a sample was prepared by cutting the cylinder to a thickness of 10 mm by eliminating at least 2.5 mm from the two parallel faces of the cylinder. •0159]<br>
A cylindrically hollow dumbbell implement may be used for cutting the foam in a cylindrical shape or for sampling the sample from under the parallel planes of the foam. [0160]<br>
The sample was left at rest in the environment of 50% compression and 50°C for 6 hours. The thickness was measured 30 minutes after the sample was released from the compression. The compression set (CS) was calculated by the following formula. [0161]<br>

 [Preparation of catalyst solution]<br>
Triphenylcarbenium(tetrakispentafluorophenyl) borate (18.4 mg) was dissolved by addition of 5 ml of toluene, and a 0.004 mmol/ml toluene solution was prepared. Separately, 1.8 mg of [dimethyl(t-butylamido)(tetramethyl-n5-cyclopentadienyl) silane]titanium dichloride was dissolved by addition of 5 ml of toluene, and a 0.001 mmol/ml toluene solution was prepared. [0165] [Preparation of ethylene/1-butene copolymer (A-1)]<br>
To a 1.5 L SUS autoclave that was sufficiently purged with nitrogen and was equipped with a stirring blade, 750 ml of heptane and 0.15 ml of a 1.0 mmol/ml hexane solution of triisobutyl aluminum (TIBA) were fed at ordinary temperature. While rotating the stirring blade and cooling the autoclave with ice, 6 g of 1-butene and 150 Nml of hydrogen were fed to the autoclave. The autoclave was then heated to 100 °C and was pressurized with ethylene to a total pressure of 0.6 MPaG. When the internal pressure of the autoclave reached 0.6 MPaG, 0.38 ml of the above-prepared<br>
[dimethyl(t-butylamido)(tetramethyl-n5-cyclopentadienyl) silane]titanium dichloride and 0.38 ml of the above-prepared triphenylcarbenium(tetrakispentafluorophenyl) borate were injected with nitrogen, and the polymerization was initiated. For the following 5 minutes, the temperature was controlled so that the internal temperature of the autoclave was 100°C, and ethylene was<br>
directly supplied to maintain the pressure at 0.6 MPaG. After 5 minutes from the initiation of the polymerization, 5 ml of methanol was introduced with nitrogen to the autoclave to stop the polymerization, and the autoclave was evacuated to atmospheric pressure. To the reaction solution, 3 L of methanol was poured with stirring. The resultant polymer containing the solvent was dried at 130°C under a reduced pressure for 13 hours to give 12 g of an ethylene/but ene copolymer (A-1). These operations were repeated, and the batches of the copolymer were collected and melt-kneaded. The copolymer thus obtained was used in the following examples. Properties of the melt-kneaded ethylene/1-butene copolymer (A-1) are shown in Table 1. The ethylene/1-butene copolymer (A-1) contained 90 mole% of constitutional units derived from ethylene and 10 mole% of constitutional units derived from 1-butene.<br>
