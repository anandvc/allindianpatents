SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE    :      AUTOMATIC ROLLING DRUM GATE FOR USE ON CANAL CROSS REGULATOR.<br>
APPLICANT (S) :       GODBOLE PRABHAKAR DAMODAR. 2/B, BUTY PLOTS, DHARAMPETH, NAGPUR  440 010, MAHARASHTRA STATE, INDIA, AN INDIAN CITIZEN.<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
Every Canal System is designed to handle the maximum possible discharge requirements at any time. However, due to differing requirements of various crops at different times, most canals have to run below their full capacity for considerable periods.<br>
A reduction in discharge causes a fall in the depth of flow in the canal. A reduced depth generally causes a reduced discharge in the off-taking branch canal or field outlet, or its total starvation. So, Cross Regulators near all such off-taking points, are employed to raise the canal water level by partially closing the Cross Regulator gates. The same gates can be completely closed, if no water is to be allowed to flow downstream of Cross Regulator.<br>
Any change in the canal discharge, caused by operation of the Main Head Regulator, necessitates a re-adjustment of Cross Regulator gate openings to maintain the desired depth of water near the off-taking point. Any delay in this can cause starvation of crop or breaching of canal.<br>
Prior Known Art<br>
Figure 1 (sheet No.l) shows a diagrammatic representation of the conventional cross regulator in sectional side elevation, where the gate niarked T is shown in a partially closed position &amp; upstream and downstream water levels at a particular canal discharge. A watchman needs to be posted at all such cross regulators to adjust the gate opening from time to time to suit changes in the canal discharge.<br>
Description Of Present Invention<br>
The present invention comprises of a cylindrical shell (closed at both its ends by circular discs), which automatically rolls forwards &amp; backwards over a pair of inclined rails (fixed on ledges provided on the abutment piers). A concave depression in the canal bed provides the necessary changes in the gate opening as the gate rolls forwards &amp; backwards.<br><br>
Figure 2 (sheet No. 2) shows a diagrammatic representation of the Automatic Rolling Drum Gate (marked 'A') installed over a cross Regulator in sectional side elevation with the gate in partially open position resting over a pair of rails (marked 'B'). A concave depression in the canal bed (marked 'C') provides the necessary waterway marked 'D' for the canal discharge to pass between the lower surface of the gate &amp; upper surface of the depressed canal bed.<br>
Operating principle :-<br>
Again referring the Figure 2, the hydrostatic pressure acting on the cylindrical gate (due to the difference between upstream &amp; downstream water levels) &amp; the hydrodynamic pressure due to flowing water give rise to an opening moment acting on the gate. This moment (marked ml) tends to roll the gate towards downstream side. The buoyant-weight of the gate (marked w) acting through its centre of gravity gives rise to a moment (marked m2), which tends to roll the gate towards the upstream side.<br>
As long as the two moments are equal, the gate remains at rest in that position. As soon as the upstream water level changes due to a change in the canal discharge, the opening moment changes. If its magnitude decreases the gate rolls towards the upstream side thereby, reducing the discharge passing through the gap between it's under surface &amp; upper surface of the concave bed. This causes a rise in the upstream water level. The rolling of the gate stops when the opening &amp; closing moments again become equal.<br>
Similarly, if the opening moment becomes greater than the closing moment, the gate rolls towards its downstream side thereby increasing the discharge that passes through the gap between the gate &amp; canal water level and a fall in the Upstream canal water level. The rolling of the gate stops as soon as the two moments becomes equal.<br><br>
Inspite of wide ranging changes in the canal discharges the difference in upstream &amp; downstream canal water levels is maintained as desired by present invention by automatic backward &amp; forward rolling movements, thus obviating the need for any manual or electrical operating of the gate by a watchman.<br>
Having explained the operating principle, the construction of the gate is now described in detail with help of figure 3, sheet no.3.<br>
Constructional Features<br>
Figure 3 shows the Automatic Rolling Drum Gate in the sectional side elevation, with all the additional components involved, in its closed position. Two curved track plates (marked "H') (whose inner diameter, is equal to outer diameter of the cylindrical  shell) are welded near the two ends of the cylindrical shell.<br>
To ensure rolling of the gate (marked 'A') over the rails (marked'B') without sliding, the gate is connected to the abutment piers through a pair of links (marked 'D'). One eye of the link 'D' is connected to a bracket (marked 'E') fixed in the abutment pier and the other eye is connected to a bracket (marked 'F'), fixed to the cylindrical gate. Two axles (marked 'G') connect the two eyes of the link to the two brackets.<br>
To enable fixing of bottom rubber seals, one vertical plate (marke'd' I) and one horizontal plate (marked 'J') are also welded to the cylindrical shell to form a 'nose'. Rubber seal (marked 'K') is fixed on the bottom edge of the vertical plate of the 'nose' by bolts (not shown). To enable fixing of side seals two rectangular end plates (marked 'L') are also welded near the two ends of the cylindrical shell. Side seals (marked 'M') are bolted to these end plates. Sill beam (marked 'N') is fixed in the canal bed and side seal seats (marked 'O') are fixed in the abutment piers to complete the sealing system.<br>
To enable manual operation of the gate during an emergency, a pair of lever systems is also provided. The lever systems consist of<br>
1.	Actuating lever (marked 'P') rotating over an axle (marked 'Q') fixed in the abutment pier,	. j<br>
2.	Gate bracket (marked 'R') fixed to the gate.<br><br>
3.	A connecting link (marked 'S') and<br>
4.	Connecting axle (marked 'T')<br>
Gun metal bushings (not shown) are provided in the eyes of the links. Rotary dampers (marked 'U') filled with silicone fluid are also mounted on the actuating lever (marked 'P') to prevent possibility of the gate oscillating to &amp; fro in case of development of waves on canal water surface due to wind.<br>
I claim<br>
1.	An automatic rolling drum gate, for use on canal cross regulators<br>
comprising of<br>
i. a cylindrical shell closed at both its ends by circular discs which automatically rolls without sliding over a pair of inclined rails fixed on ledges provided on the abutment piers/ ii. a pair of links connecting the brackets attached to the drum gate and abutment piers through axles fixed in the brackets and rotating freely in the eyes of the links; iii. a pair of lever systems each consisting of an actuating lever, a gate bracket, a connecting link, axle and rotary damper.<br>
2.	An automatic rolling drum gate, for use on canal cross regulators as claimed<br>
in claim 1 wherein rubber seals are clamped on the side end plates and at<br>
the bottom on a nosing formed by two plates welded to the cylindrical<br>
shell, by means of nut bolts for making the gate leak proof in its closed<br>
position.<br><br>
