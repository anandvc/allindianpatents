				<td>Control   pedal   for  controlling   an  actuator  of   a  motor<br>
vehicle,   provided  with  rotation  pin  with  fixing  of<br>
the   electronic   sensor<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a control pedal for controlling an actuator mounted on a motor vehicle, provided with rotation pin with an advanced fixing system in addition to a system for annulling the thrusts normal to the plane of rotation of the arm of the pedal, which can be applied by the foot of the driver of the means and which have an adverse effect on the precision of the electrical/electronic sensor  with  which   the  pedal   as   a  whole   is   equipped.<br>
The known art envisages that, for fixing the rotation pin of a control pedal for controlling an actuator mounted on a motor vehicle, there will be adopted the classic method of forced interference fit or else fixing via screws or bolts, which entails an accurate machining in the former case and long times in the latter case, with consequent increase in costs.<br>
Likewise, the known art envisages that the rotor of   the   sensors   will   be   fitted   directly   to   the   arm   of<br>
the pedal by means of the rotation pin thereof. Said type of transmission of the motion means that any possible lateral thrusts applied to the pedal will be transmitted to the rotor of the sensor with consequent relative movement between the latter and the static part of the sensor itself, consequently introducing errors in the electrical signal at output from  the   sensor.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a device that will enable transmission between the arm of the pedal and the rotor of the sensor of exclusively rotational motion, and at the same time, to provide a fixing system for a control pedal for the electrical or electronic control of an actuator of a motor vehicle that will overcome the aforesaid drawback  and  at   the   same  time  will   have   a   low  cost.<br>
The above and further purposes are achieved by the present invention, the subject of which is a pedal for controlling a device of a motor vehicle provided with a control pedal for electrical or electronic control of an actuator that has the characteristics specified   in  Claim   1.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages will emerge clearly from the ensuing description, with reference to      the      attached     plates      of      drawings,       which      are<br>
provided  purely  by  way  of   non-limiting   example   and   in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a front exploded view of the top<br>
part of a control pedal of a motor vehicle<br>
provided with the pin according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view from above of the pin according to the invention, mounted on the top end of the pedal illustrated in Figure   1;<br>
-	Figure 3 is an enlarged view of the Oldham coupling   illustrated   in  Figure   1;   and<br>
-	Figure 4 is an enlarged view of the pin according  to  the   invention.<br>
With reference to the figures, designated as a whole by 1 is a pedal for controlling an actuator mounted on a motor vehicle and made of plastic material, said pedal being designed to control the actuator via an electrical or electronic control system, i.e., without there being necessary a mechanical   connection,   for  example,   a  Bowden  cable.<br>
The pedal is pivoted at the top end 2 of its arm 3, on a support 4, which is in turn fixed to a fixed point of the vehicle via common fixing means, for example,       screws       (not      represented)  .       The      axis      of<br>
fulcrum is constituted by a cylindrical pin 5 provided with an axial internal cavity 6 and made of plastic material. The cylindrical pin 5 has two flattened portions 7, on the top and bottom walls, and two snap-action couplings 8 on the right-hand-side and left-hand-side walls. The flattened portions 7, in collaboration with corresponding flattened portions (not illustrated) made on the end 2, have the purpose of enabling insertion of the pin 5 in the support 4 and in the end 2 only in two definite positions so that the snap-action couplings, when the pin is in the operative position, will be positioned in areas corresponding to openings 10 made in the end 2 and constituting the point of arrest thereof. The pin 5 moreover has an end of larger diameter and an end of smaller diameter with respect to the central body so as to form two detents for the movement of insertion of the pin 5, one on the outer surface of the end 2 of the pedal, and the other on the inner surface of the body of the support 4, as may be seen in  Figure   2.<br>
Connected to the pin 5 is the rotor 12 of a position sensor 14. In order to transmit, between the arm of the pedal and the rotor of the sensor, exclusively   the   rotational   motion  without   the   thrusts<br>
normal to the plane of rotation thereof, the aforesaid rotor is connected to the pedal via an Oldham coupling 16, which, according to the present embodiment, is made of plastic material but may be made of any suitable material, said Oldham coupling 16 being housed in two slots 17 and 18, one made in the  pin   5   and  the   other   in  the   rotor   12.<br>
The Oldham coupling 16 has on its walls in contact with the slots 17 and 18 elastic elements 20 in the form of laminas, made as a single casting, which enable forced positioning and withholding of the Oldham coupling 16 within said slots. The Oldham coupling 16 has a length such as not to reach the bottom of the slots and consequently such as to be able   to   slide  within  them.<br><br><br><br><br>
