				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel system for measuring dimensions of any circular object having a central bore. The system is adapted to measure all major dimensions of any circular object having a central bore along with profile of the object and eccentricity in the object. More particularly, the invention relates to a system for measuring dimensions of Rail Road Wheel in cold condition. &gt;.<br>
It is presently known to measure dimensions of rail road wheel following the steps discussed hereunder:<br>
i.        After dishing operation, one mobile charger holds the wheel.<br>
ii.        One operator then takes the dimension of the wheel, with Go/No Go<br>
gauges.<br>
iii.       Only few dimensions of the wheel are measurable in this manner, iv.      When wheel becomes cold then other dimensions are taken, v.       Wheel is placed on the floor of the shop, vi.      With the  help of callipers and scale, dimensions of the wheel are<br>
measured, vii.      Dimension in Z-plane is measured with the help of two scales.<br>
It is experienced that the above known art of measuring dimensions of rail road wheel have limitations/drawbacks as discussed hereunder:<br>
i.        Due to variation in process many a times these wheels are eccentric which<br>
could not be measured using the known system. This eccentricity leads to<br>
wash out at different places of the wheels during subsequent process<br>
resulting in rejection of the wheels, ii.        In such known system of dimension measurement, it was very difficult to<br>
measure dimensions in two planes at the same time, iii.       In the known system measured dimensions usually varied from operator to<br>
operator, iv.       In the known system measured dimensions were dependent on operators<br>
eye estimation, v.       Also in such known system there was no provision for display of measured<br>
dimension digitally.<br><br>
 2<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a system whereby eccentricity of wheels could be measured thereby leading to reduction in rejection of wheels in subsequent processing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for measuring dimensions of circular objects whereby the measurement can be taken in two planes at a same time.<br>
Another object is to provide a system for measuring dimensions of circular objects which would provide for more accurate and consistent measurement of dimensions and would avoid variation in measurement due to change of operator. The system of measuring would enable accurate measurement with accuracy of about 0.2 mm which is much improved than the accuracy of 1 mm of the presently known systems.<br>
Further object is directed to provide a measuring system which would measure the dimensions of circular objects and would be adapted to display all the measured dimensions digitally.<br>
Yet further object is to provide a system of measuring dimensions of circular objects which would enable segregation of products differently depending on their dimensions and eccentricity. This would lead to faster rate of production down the line depending on dimensions of the circular objects which was not possible in the previous known systems.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to enable measurement of dimensions and provide information about dimensions quickly so that corrective action may be taken immediately to overcome that defect. It can be adapted to set any point as reference and all the measurement can be done with reference to that point thereby avoiding any mathematical operation to know dimensions.<br><br>
3<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide a system which would provide for measurement of all types of wheels that can be measured at one place and without changing any parameter.<br>
Yet further object is to provide a system of measuring dimensions which apart from wheels can also measure dimensions of other circular objects having a central bore.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a system of measuring dimensions of circular objects which would be robust to withstand the harsh industrial environment would be cheap, easy to operate and provide almost maintenance free dimension measuring system.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a system for measuring dimensions of any circular object having atleast one central bore comprising:<br>
a   centering   device   (CD)   provided   with   collapsible   unit   (CU)   and   supporting<br>
measuring arm (MA) adapted to determine the central axis of the bore;<br>
measuring means (MD) comprising shaft encoder (SE) adapted for measurement of<br>
dimensions in any direction in relation to the central axis of the bore determined by<br>

bolted to the ground using base bolts (BB). The column (CL) rotatably supports the centering device (CD) via a flexible arm (FA). The CD is provided with collapsible unit (CU) and supports a measuring arm (MA) having at its free end the shaft encoders (SE) used for measuring of dimensions. The detailed construction of the various components used in the measuring system are provided hereunder.<br>
The support column:<br>
The column (CL) is preferably fabricated from MS plate and consists of base plate body and<br>
having said cross section.<br>
Collapsible Centering Device :<br>
This system of the invention is adapted to determine centre of the wheel with help of a centering device (CD). The Centering Device is essentially a device which is a central axis of any circular object with relation to its bore. It consists of one collapsible unit and one handle. The centering device is provided with dimensions and shaped to avoid hindrance by the burrs at the bore of the wheels. For deciding centre of the wheel this centering device is inserted in the bore of the wheel with help of handle means (HM2) and then rotated clockwise so that the centering device is expanded with help of handle means (HM1) so that it grips the walls of the bore. When the handle is rotated anti-clockwise, the devise collapses enabling the user to remove the centering device from the bore. In the measuring system of the invention the central bore axis is taken as the centre of the wheel. The axis of centering device is adapted for use in any type of wheels.<br>
The Measuring Arm :<br>
The measuring arm (MA) is also preferably obtained of stainless steel. The measuring arm cross section was selected in such a way so as to withstand the cantilever force due to two nos. of sensing devices (SD) and brackets with pointer. The arm is provided with sufficient rigidity. The measuring arm is attached with the centering device. On the arm of the movable shaft encoders and pointers are fitted and placed in a box. This box is movable on the Measuring Arm; movement is rack and pinion type. The movement of the bracket is on lead screw for smooth and precise movement over the measuring arm. The tip of the pointer is made of carbide to withstand impact and abrasion with the wheel. The shaft encoder reads distance of the central axis from the pointer and this is digitally displayed. Similarly, pointer can be moved up and down and it can be placed to the point. Distance of the point from the central axis as well as vertical distance is digitally displayed. This arm is capable of rotating in horizontal plane perpendicular to the axis of Centering Device.<br><br>
6<br>
Measuring Device/Measasing Means :<br>
Measuring device (MD) consists of two nos. of rotatory shaft encoder (SE) to<br>
measure dimensions in both horizontal and vertical planes. Preferably, it has<br>
supply voltage of 5 volts DC and output pulses as 380 PPR. Supply current is 50<br>
to 70 mA and output frequency is 25 Khz (max.). Shaft of these encoders are<br>
preferably, made of stainless steel having diameter of 6 mm.	:<br>

Its supply voltage is 220 volts and resolution of 0.1 mm. The display unit (DU) can be preferably mounted with respect to the column (CL) as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the system of the invention can also incorporate recording facility and for the purpose a recording means can be provided to record to measured dimensions indicated by the indication means.<br>
The method of carrying out the measurement of bore dimension of wheel using the system of the invention involve the following simple steps:<br>
i.        At first wheel is placed on the measuring platform located in front of the<br>
invention.<br>
ii.        Power of the control panel is switched ON. iii.       Then X and Z axis measurement switches are ON. iv.      Then the centering device is placed over the bore of the wheel and<br>
handwheel of the centering device is rotated to place centering device<br>
inside the bore, v.       Then top hand wheel of the centering device is tightened so that three<br>
jaws open and lock inside the bore at equal distance, vi.       Now knobs of the measuring devices are turned so that pointer is placed<br>
at the required location for measurement. The digital read out gives<br>
directly the vertical and horizontal readings, vii.      The measuring arm now may be rotated to any direction in which further<br>
readings are required.<br><br>
viii.     Once the measurement is complete top and  side  handwheels  are unlocked and centering device is lifted from the wheel.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide a novel system of measurement of dimensions of circular objects with central bore which would be simple to operate and provide for a more accurate measurement of dimensions as compared to presently known system.<br><br>
