				<td>DILUTE FABRIC CARE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THICKENERS AND FABRIC CARE COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN THE PRESENCE OF ANIONIC<br>
CARRY-OVER<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fabric care compositions comprising a thickener. The present invention also relates to fabric care compositions for use in the presence of high anionic carry-over conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fabric care compositions deliver a number of desirable characteristics to fabrics upon treatment, including an improved fabric feel and a perception of freshness. However, in order to secure high consumer acceptance of any fabric care composition, it is essential to provide consumer-desirable product aesthetics, for example not only an appealing neat product odor and a pleasant product color, but especially an appropriate product rheology and satisfactory physical product stability. Controlling the rheology of the fabric care composition becomes increasingly challenging as the concentration of the fabric softening active is lowered (i.e., dilute). There is a continuing need to provide thickeners for fabric care composition comprising a low (e.g., less than 10%) fabric softener active level to achieve commercially acceptable product rheology. As used herein, the term "thickener" means a compound that increases the viscosity of the composition. Although thickeners have been generally disclosed, there is a continuing need to find a combination of fabric softener active(s) and thickeners to provide enhanced deposition.<br>
There is also a continuing need to identify thickeners that are water dispersible. A thickener that is easily water dispersible may reduce the cycle time and costs associated with manufacturing processes. An easily water dispersible polymer allows for the quick incorporation of the thickener in many phases of the manufacturing process.<br>
There is also a continuing need to provide fabric care compositions wherein the fabric softener active forms small sized (e.g., less than 3 microns in diameter) particles. Fabric softening actives formed as small sized particles may provide more uniform softening on fabrics and/or deeper penetration in depositing onto fabric.<br>
See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,271,192; and 6,465,416 both by Daniel Verstrat, et al.; and U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0229769 Al.<br>
The presence of anionic surfactant carry-over (particularly under hand washing conditions) there are additional challenges that must be met by the fabric care composition, including the formation of suds and scum residue during the rinse. See e.g., U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2003/0060390 Al.   It is important to control suds formation in both machine and hand-rinse conditions. In the case of machine-rinse conditions, uncontrolled sudsing can lead to temporary machine failure, known as suds lock. In the case of hand-rinse conditions, sudsing is an undesirable user experience because sudsing is a signal to the user that the laundry has not been effectively rinsed. The user will continue to rinse fabrics until suds are abated thereby wasting both water and time in the laundry process. Therefore, there is a need for a fabric care composition that eliminates suds, especially in a first rinse bath solution.<br>
There is also a continuing need to provide a fabric softening product that can be used in a first rinse bath solution without forming floes. Floe (e.g., scum residue), can be formed by the presence of some cationic fabric softener actives in the presence of anionic surfactant, negatively affecting the softness performance.<br>
There is also a need to provide an inexpensive fabric care product, particularly in hand-rinse and economically developing geographies, that will address one or more the abovementioned needs in a cost effective manner.<br>
The present invention attempts to address these and other needs.<br>

A. FABRIC SOFTNER ACTIVE<br>
Any compound can be used, for purposes of the present invention, as a fabric softer active provided the compound imparts a softening benefit to treated fabric.

In the present invention, the FSA is an ester quaternary ammonium compound. In the present invention, the FSA is formed from a reaction product of a fatty acid and an amine obtaining mixtures of mono-, di-, and even tri-species compounds. <br>

and FSAs with mixed amido and ester linkages as well as the aforementioned diester linkages.<br>
A first type of DEQA ("DEQA (1)") suitable as a FSA in the present compositions includes compounds of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein each R substituent is either hydrogen, a short chain C1-C8, preferably C1-C6 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group, e.g., methyl (most preferred), ethyl, propyl, hydroxyethyl, and the like, poly (£2-3 alkoxy), preferably polyethoxy, group, benzyl, or mixtures<br>

and preferably these are the same; and X" can be any softener-compatible anion, preferably, chloride, bromide, methylsulfate, ethylsulfate, sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate, more preferably chloride or methyl sulfate. Preferred DEQA compounds are typically made by reacting alkanolamines such as MDEA (methyldiethanolamine) and TEA (triethanolamine) with fatty acids. Some materials that typically result from such reactions include N,N-di(acyl-oxyethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride or N,N-di(acyl-oxyethyl)-N,N-methylhydroxyethylammonium methylsulfate wherein the acyl group is derived from animal fats, unsaturated, and polyunsaturated, fatty acids, e.g., oleic acid, and/or partially hydrogenated fatty acids, derived from vegetable oils and/or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as, canola oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, tall oil, rice bran oil, etc. Non-limiting examples of suitable fatty acids are listed in US 5,759,990 at column 4, lines 45-66.<br>
In one embodiment, the fabric softener active is one described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0204337 Al, published Oct. 14,2004 to Corona et al., from paragraphs 30 - 79.<br>
In another embodiment, the fabric softener active is one described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0229769 Al, published Nov. 18,2005, to Smith et al., on paragraphs 26-31; or U.S. Pat. No. 6,494,920, at column 1, line 51 et seq. detailing an "esterquat" or a quaternized fatty acid triethanolamine ester salt.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that active softener materials made from such process can comprise a combination of mono-, di-, and tri-esters depending on the process and the starting materials. Materials from this group for the present invention may include, in one embodiment, those comprising a high level of diester content; typically greater than 40%, preferably greater than 55%, still more preferably greater than 60%, of the total softener active weight (as used herein, the "total softener active weight" includes the mass encompassing all reaction products that comprise one or more R.1 and this weight is used to quantify the individual percentages of mono-, di-, and tri-ester reaction products by dividing the individual masses of mono-, di-, and tri-ester by the hereinabove stated total softener active and multiplying this number by 100 to give a percentage of the total).<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, wherein the composition is used in applications with low anionic carry-over in the rinse bath, it is desired to have the following mole ratios of diester species to monoester species; at least about 2 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester, preferably at least about 3 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester, and most preferably at least about 5 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester. It is acceptable for this aspect of the invention to have no monoester present, but typically there is less than about 40 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester, and preferably less than 20 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester and more preferably less than about 10 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester and most preferably less than about 6 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester. In this aspect of the invention, wherein the composition is used in conditions of low anionic carry-over, it is typical to have at least about 30% and preferably at least about 40% by of total softener active weight contributed by a diester species.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, wherein the composition is used in application having high anionic carry-over in the rinse bath, it is desired to have the following mole ratios of diester to monoester species; typically less than about 2 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester, preferably less than 1.6 moles of diester to about 1 mole of monoester, more preferably about 1.3 mole of diester to about 1 mole of<br>
monoester, and typically more than 0.5 mole of diester for 1 mole of monoester, preferably more than about 1 mole of diester for 1 mole of monoester. In this aspect of the invention, it is typical to have at least about 60% diester, more preferably at least about 65% diester, even more preferably at least about 70% diester of the total softener active weight.<br>
The FSA, in one embodiment, is preferably chosen from at least one of the following: ditallowoyloxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, dihydrogenated-tallowoyloxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, ditallowoyloxyethyl dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, dihydrogenated-tallowoyloxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, dihydrogenated-tallowoyloxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In one embodiment the FSA comprises from at least about 1%, alternatively at least about 2%, alternatively at least about 3%, alternatively at least about 4%, alternatively at least about 5%, alternatively about 6%, alternatively at least about 7%; but not greater than about 14%, alternatively not greater than about 12%, alternatively not greater than 10%, alternatively not greater 9%, alternatively not greater than about 8%, alternatively not greater than about 7%, alternatively not greater than about 6%, alternatively not greater than about 5% by weight of the fabric care composition. 1. Monoester Level in FSA<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a monoester species level in the FSA of at least about 10% but not greater than about 50% by the total softener active weight. As used herein, the "total FSA weight" includes the mass encompassing all reaction products<br>
that comprise one or more R.1 and this weight is used to quantify the individual percentages of mono-, di-, and tri-ester reaction products by dividing the individual masses of mono-, di-, and tri-esters by the hereinabove stated total softener active weight and multiplying this number by 100 to give a percentage of the total.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the monoester may provide up to at least three benefits to the fabric care compositions of the present invention.<br>
Firstly, increasing the monoester species content (at least relative to the diester and/or triester content) of the FSA increases the solubility of the FSA in water (as well as a broad range of solvents). However, too high a level of monoester species content<br>
provides a FSA that does not provide enough softening efficiency. It is the diester species content of the FSA that may most significantly provide the fabric softening benefits.<br>
Secondly, a monoester species level in the FSA in the ranges described herein provides compositions that exhibit excellent resilience to anionic surfactant carry-over conditions. For example, if the composition of the present invention is used as a "single rinse" fabric softener product (e.g., DOWNY Single Rinse), the user will typically bring a considerable amount of anionic surfactant carryover into the rinse bath solution. This may be particularly true in a hand washing conditions. The term "anionic surfactant carrier-over" means the anionic surfactant that may be present either on the fabric or in the wash liquor during the wash cycle of the laundry process and that is carried over with the laundered fabrics into the rinse bath solution. In turn, the term "rinse bath solution" means the solution used to rinse the fabric subsequent to their washing. Users may typically use multiple rinse bath solutions in so-called rinse process. A "first rinse bath solution" means the first solution used to rinse the fabric subsequent to their washing.<br>
Many fabric softening products will instruct the user to at least rinse the laundry in a rinse bath solution at least once, after washing the laundry, to remove the detersive detergent, from the laundry, before rinsing with the softening product. In other words, these products will typically instruct the user to use the product in the last rinse cycle. Many of these products, if used in the first rinse step, will typically result in floe formation in the rinse bath solution from the positively charged cationic fabric softener active reacting with the negatively charged anionic surfactant in anionic surfactant carrier-over. This floe often yields to a particulate or filmy white scum adhering to fabric. The floe formation may result whether the laundry process is conducted manually, automatically, semi-automatically, or combinations thereof.   The term "floes" means the visible precipitates, or flocculated matter which is generally opaque in nature, or scum or residue on the surface rinse bath solution. Although not necessarily solid or compact, such floes are sufficiently large to be noticeable by the unaided eye, typically, not less than about 0.4 mm when measured along its shortest axis. Floes are undesirable because it can deposit on fabric leaving an undesirable appearance often times resulting in the user to re-wash the laundry thereby leading to wasted time, effort, and water.<br>
There are at least two ways to measure resilience of the fabric care composition of the present invention to anionic surfactant carry-over conditions.<br>
(a)	Floe Formation Test Method. One embodiment of the invention provides for<br>
the absence or substantially the absence of floe formation in a first rinse bath solution<br>
under anionic surfactant carry-over conditions. A suitable Floe Formation Test Method is<br>
detailed in U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. US 2003/0060390, to Demeyere, published March<br>
27,2003, at paragraphs 227-228. Notably the test solution is defined as being<br>
"substantially free" from floes if the total number of visible floes retained on the sieve is<br>
less than 50. The test solution is being defined as being "free" from floes if the number<br>
of visible floes retained is less than 10. One embodiment of the invention provides for<br>
the use of a fabric care composition of the present invention to soften fabric in a first rinse<br>
bath solution such that the rinse bath solution is substantially free from floes, preferably<br>
free from floes, in the first rinse bath solution.<br>
(b)	Anionic Carryover Tolerance Test: One embodiment of the invention<br>
provides for a fabric care composition that exhibits superior anionic carryover tolerance<br>
(while preferably still providing commercially acceptable fabric softness). The Anionic<br>
Carryover Tolerance Test is herein defined: The first sign of floe formation to the<br>
unaided eye is considered an end point.  A 0.6% sodium dodecyl benzyne sulfonate<br>
(NaLAS) solution is used as the titrant solution. 0.75g of FSA is placed in about a 225ml<br>
vessel and then filled to about 75g with 14 grains per gallon water (3:1 Ca:Mg hardness).<br>
A mixer (such as a Ika Werke model RW 20 DZM with an impeller having a 4 cm<br>
diameter blade with about a 20° slant) on a slow setting (about 350 rpm) is used to<br>
disperse the FSA in the vessel. The contents of the vessel are titrated with the titrant<br>
solution at rate of about 1 drop per second until floe formation is observed. Data is<br>
averaged over three replicates. The greater the time elapses before floe formation is<br>
observed, the greater the anionic carry-over tolerance of a given fabric care composition.<br>
A third and final reason the monoester levels described herein may provide particularly useful benefits is by providing compositions that may achieve a microstructure in the composition that is substantially unilamellar in appearance when examined by electron microscopy. One embodiment of the invention provides for a FSA that forms particles in the fabric care composition. Without wishing to be bound by<br>
theory, compositions with smaller particle sizes may provide a more uniform softening on fabrics and deeper penetration into the fabric for deposition as compared to those fabric care compositions with larger particle sizes. Additionally, and again without wishing to be bound by theory, when the FSA comprises an ester quaternary ammonium compound, an optimal ratio of monoester species to diester species may contribute, at least in part, to a smaller vesicle size formation. Moreover, an optimized ratio of monoester to diester may also lead to compositions (in addition to having a smaller particle size) that are more resilient to anionic carryover conditions thereby providing improved fabric softness under these conditions.<br>
There are at least two methods of determining particle size for purposes of the present invention.<br>
(a) One method is by the HORIBA™ Light Scattering Technique. The term "HORIB A™ Light Scattering Technique" means a technique where particle-size distribution (as an average particle diameter size) is determined using a HORIBA™ LA-910 Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer equipped with a flow cell. Approximately 0.3 mL of fabric softener composition is added to approximately ISOmLs of deionized water in the sampling chamber (so that the transmission intensity is between 80-95%, as specified by HORIBA). The sample is circulated and analyzed within 1 minute of introduction into the sample chamber. Thereafter, the particle size distribution is measured using Horiba LA-910 Measurement Program, Version 1.30, using the volume distribution base and a relative refractive index of 1.03.  For purposes of clarification, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that FSA formed particles may comprise other ingredients in relatively minor amounts such as, but not limited to, unreacted fatty acids from the manufacture of ester quaternary ammonium compounds or hydrophobic perfume ingredients that have migrated into the particle. In one embodiment, the particles are distributed so less than about 20% of the total number of ester quaternary ammonium compound particles have a diameter greater than about 3 microns, as measured by the HORIBA Light Scattering Technique. In a second embodiment, the particles are distributed so less than about 10% of the total number of ester quaternary ammonium compound particles have a diameter greater than about 1 micron, as measured by the HORIBA Light Scattering Technique.<br>
 (b) A second method of measuring particle size includes by way the Harmonic Intensity Averaged Particle Diameter. The "Harmonic Intensity Averaged Diameter" is described in the article entitled "Particle Sizing by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. Part 2. Average values," by Finsy, R. and Dejaeger, N. in the journal entitled Particle &amp; Particle Systems Characterization, volume 8, issue 3, from pages 187-193 (September 1991). Briefly, Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) 4700 equipment (Malvern, U.K.) is used with a vertically polarized 10 mW He-Ne laser with a wavelength of 633 run. The<br>
scattering angle is 90 °C. Samples are in 75 x 10 mm cylindrical cuvettes. Data is<br>
processed by a multi 8-bit 7032CN digital correlator with 4x16 channels and a dilation factor of 4. The autocorrelation function is accumulated during 60 seconds. The fundamental sampling time is automatically selected by the software. The temperature is at 25 °C and the detector aperture is at 150 um. DLS data analysis is conducted using the CONTIN option in the Malvern Instruments PCS vl.36 software.  Product sample is diluted 500 - 1000 times with de-ionized water to obtain a suitable light scattering intensity. Three measurements are done per sample.<br>

G. PARTICLE SIZE<br>
One aspect of the invention provides for a FSA, in one embodiment the FSA is an ester quaternary compound suitable for softening fabric, to form particles in the fabric care composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, compositions with smaller particle sizes provide a more uniform softening on fabrics and deeper penetration into the fabric for deposition as compared to those fabric care compositions with larger particle sizes. Additionally, and again without wishing to be bound by theory, when the FSA comprises an ester quaternary ammonium compound, an optimal ratio of monoester species to diester species may contribute, at least in part, to a smaller vesicle size formation. Moreover, an optimized ratio of monoester to diester may also lead to compositions (in addition to having a smaller particle size) are more resilient to LAS carry-over when anionic-based detergents are used and provide improved softness in the presence of LAS carry-over.<br>
In one embodiment, the particles are distributed in the composition so that at least 50%, alternatively at least 60%, alternatively at least 70%, alternatively at least 80%, alternatively at least 85%, alternatively at least 90%, by the total number of the FSA particles comprise an average diameter of less than about 3 microns, but greater than 0.05 microns, as measured by the HORIBA™ Light Scattering Technique.  In another embodiment, the particles are distributed in the composition so that at least 50%, alternatively at least 60%, alternatively at least 70%, alternatively at least 80%, alternatively at least 85%, alternatively at least 90%, by the total number of the FSA particles comprise an average diameter of less than about 1 micron, but greater than 0.05 microns, as measured by the HORIBA™ Light Scattering Technique.<br>
The term "HORIBA™ Light Scattering Technique" means a technique where particle-size distribution as an average diameter is determined using a LA-910™ Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer equipped with a flow cell. Approximately 0.3 mLs of fabric softener composition is added to approximately I50mLs of deionized water in the sampling chamber (so that the transmission intensity is between 80-95%, as specified by HORIBA). For best results, the sample is circulated and analyzed within 1 minute of introduction into the sample chamber. Thereafter, the particle size distribution is measured using Horiba LA-910 Measurement Program, Version 1.30, using the volume distribution base and a relative refractive index of 1.03. For purposes of clarification, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that FSA formed particles may comprise other ingredients in relatively minor amounts such as, but not limited to, unreacted fatty acids from the manufacture of ester quaternary ammonium compounds or hydrophobic perfume ingredients that have migrated into the particle.

A ring stand and clamp is used to hold a Mettler-Toledo 8200 Turbidity Probe, which is submersed in the solution. For each sample, a base-line turbidity measurement of the water was recorded and used as the normalization factor. Subsequent turbidity measurements, reported in National Transmittance Units (NTU), of the solution are recorded at 5 second intervals for approximately 1 minute and at 10 second intervals for as long as needed, no longer than approximately 7 minutes, using the Mettler-Toledo 8300 Turbidity Transmitter. Preferred rheology modifiers disperse in solutions that reach steady-state turbidity at or before 40 seconds.  Table III lists the times to reach steady-state turbidity of various preferred rheology modifiers and non-preferred rheology modifiers.<br>

Example X: NaLAS TOLERANCE LEVELS AS MEASURED BY THE SUDS CYLINDER METHOD<br>
The suds reduction performance of currently marketed products and the compositions of the present invention under anionic surfactant carrier over conditions are compared. The Suds Cylinder Method is herein described: a suds cylinder test machine consisting of a rotating frame with space for at least 6 cylinders. The cylinders are made of a hard, clear material, such as PLEXI-glass™ an internal diameter of 9cm and a height of 30cm. The cylinder also has lid made of the same material as the cylinder to allow one to observe inside the cylinder.<br>
Each sample of the fabric care composition is tested in a cylinder, in duplicate, at 3 levels of NaLAS, under the following conditions:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
JDodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, Aldrich<br>
The cylinders are closed with lids and placed on the suds cylinder test machine. The rotation speed is adjusted to 30 rotations per minute (rpm). After 5 minutes, the machine is stopped and the time (in seconds) is measured for suds to collapse completely ("collapse time"). Suds collapse is measured by the unaided eye viewing through the cylinder/cylinder lid.<br>
The "tolerated NaLAS level" is calculated by interpolating the NaLAS level for which the collapse time is 10 seconds. This method is suitable for fabric softeners containing a high level of silicone suds suppressor (0.1-0.15% active by weight of fabric care composition) and FS A level between 7-9% by weight of the fabric care composition.<br>
The FSA dosage and/or NaLAS levels may need to be recalculated when silicone suds suppressor level and/or the FSA level are outside these ranges.<br>
