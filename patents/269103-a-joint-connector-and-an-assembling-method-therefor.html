				<td>A Joint Connector And An Assembling Method Therefor<br>
The present invention relates to a joint connector including sub-housings arranged in a plurality of levels and to an assembling method therefor.<br>
A joint connector disclosed in Publication of Japanese Patent No. 3433797 is, for example, known as the one of this type. The joint connector is constructed such that contact portions and engaging portions are provided on side surfaces in the respective levels and brought into contact with each other at proper assembled positions to assemble a plurality of sub-housings in alignment when the respective sub-housings are properly built up.<br>
In this joint connector, for the reason of, e.g. reducing a mold cost, common sub-housings formed with a plurality of contact portions and engaging portions on side surfaces thereof are prepared and the contact portions and the engaging portions are selectively cut off according to the levels the sub-housings are to be located during a process of building up the sub-housings.<br>
However, since a mating housing, into which the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels are fitted, has a fixed size, if the contact portions and the engaging portions are provided on the side surfaces of the sub-housings, the inner walls of cavities for accommodating terminal fittings are thinned and the connector has a reduced strength as a whole There are also problems such as an increased burden on an operator due to the operation of cutting oft the<br>
contact portions and the engaging portions and the disposal of the sub-housing if the contact portions and the engaging portions are cut off at wrong positions.<br>
Furthermore, as a construction for holding the terminal fittings in the cavities, it may be thought, for example, to form retainer insertion openings communicating with the insides of the cavities in mating surfaces at one side of the respective sub-housings, to provide retainers insertable into the cavities through the retainer insertion openings on mating surfaces on the other side, and to cause the retainers to enter the cavities through the retainer insertion openings and lock the terminal fittings accommodated in the cavities as the sub-housings are built up.<br>
In such a construction, if specified clearances are set between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings and the retainers for the purpose of reducing connection forces exerted at the time of building up the sub-housings, displacements of the built-up sub-housings along plane surfaces of the mating surfaces within the set ranges of the clearances are permitted.<br>
For example, if a connecting operation is performed by pushing only a bottommost sub-housing 100 out of built-up sub-housings as shown in FIG. 33, the respective sub-housings are gradually displaced backward (leftward in FIG. 33) in a connecting direction from the lower levels toward the upper levels. Concerning the uppermost sub-housing 101, the connecting operation couid be completed before the sub-housing 101 reaches a proper connection position. Further, if the uppermost sub-housing 101 is provided with a lock arm 102, a<br><br>
lock projection 103 of the lock arm 102 may not be fitted into a lock hole 201, so that locking is not effected.<br>
Furthermore, as the sub-housings are provided with cavities capable of accommodating terminal fittings, and an end of a wiring harness is connected with the terminal fittings, after the terminal fittings are accommodated into the cavities, each sub-housing before being built up is often mounted in an inspection apparatus and an electrical connection test for the terminal fittings is conducted by bringing conducting probes provided in the inspection apparatus into contact with the terminal fittings.<br>
However, in this electrical connection test, it is possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings are connected with a correct wiring harness, but not possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings are accommodated in proper sub-housings. Thus, the wiring harness is wrongly laid after the sub-housings are built up if the terminal fittings are accommodated in the sub-housings different from the correct ones.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to facilitate a building-up operation by preventing an erroneous buildup of sub-housings, particularly without causing any reduction in strength.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a joint connector, comprising:<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels, one or more cavities provided in the respective sub-housings and capable of at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings, and<br>
one or more projecting pieces provided on outer sides of the respective sub-housings, projecting in a direction intersecting with a build-up direction of the sub-housings, wherein:<br>
one or more identifying projections are provided on mating surfaces at one side of the respective projecting pieces, and one or more identifying recesses for at least partly receiving the identifying projections therein if the sub-housings are properly built up are provided in mating surfaces at the other side.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the one or more projecting pieces form a hand-push portion by building up the sub-housings,<br>
wherein:<br>
as the sub-housings built up in a plurality of levels are at least partly fitted into a mating housing by pushing or operating the hand-push portion toward the mating housing, the terminal fittings are electrically connected with one or more corresponding mating terminal fittings provided in or at the mating housing.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a joint connector, comprising;<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels,<br>
cavities provided in the respective sub-housings and capable of accommodating terminal fittings, and<br>
projecting pieces provided on outer sides of the respective sub-housings, projecting in a direction intersecting with a build-up direction of the sub-housings and forming a hand-push portion by building up the sub-housings,<br>
wherein:<br>
as the sub-housings built up in a plurality of levels are fitted into a mating housing by pushing the hand-push portion toward the mating housing, the terminal fittings are electrically connected with mating terminal fittings provided in the mating housing, and<br>
identifying projections are provided on mating surfaces at one side of the respective projecting pieces, and identifying recesses for receiving the identifying projections therein if the sub-housings are properly built up are provided in mating surfaces at the other sides.<br>
According to such a construction, since the identifying projections are at least partly received into the identifying recesses if the sub-housings are properly built up, an erroneous buildup of the sub-housings can be prevented. Further, since the identifying projections and the identifying recesses are provided utilizing the hand-push portion as an existing structure, the joint connector can be made smaller as compared with the case where the identifying projections and the identifying recesses are separately provided Furthermore, since the projecting pieces forming the hand-push portion are<br>
provided on the outer sides of the sub-housings, the inner walls of the cavities need not be thinned and, hence, there is no likelihood of reducing the strength of the joint connector as a whole.<br>
The present invention is preferably embodied as follows.<br>
The identifying projections and the identifying recesses may be substantially aligned with each other in the build-up direction in a properly built-up state of the sub-housings, the identifying recesses may have hole shapes substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the identifying projections, and the projecting ends of the identifying projections may interfere with the opening edges of the identifying recesses due to different cross-section shapes and/or different orientations of the cross-section shapes and the hole shapes unless the sub-housings are properly built up.<br>
According to such a construction, since the identifying projections are at least partly received into the identifying recesses when the cross-sectionai shapes and/or the orientations of the cross-sectional shapes of the identifying projections and those of the hole shapes of the identifying recesses coincide, an erroneous buildup of the sub-housings can be prevented. For example, if a pair of identifying projections and a pair of identifying recesses are arranged for each sub-housing while being spaced at specified intervals in width direction (direction intersecting with both build-up direction and connecting direction), these identifying projections and identifying recesses can be aligned in the build-up direction with the intervals between the identifying projections and<br>
between the identifying recesses fixed. Therefore, there is no likelihood of enlarging the joint connector in width direction.<br>
A pair of projecting pieces may be provided for each sub-housing, a pair of identifying projections and a pair of identifying recesses may be respectively provided at specified intervals, and the projecting ends of the identifying projections may interfere with the mating surface at the other side due to different intervals between the identifying projections and between the identifying recesses unless the sub-housings are properly built up.<br>
According to such a construction, since the pair of identifying projections are received into the pair of identifying recesses when the interval between the pair of identifying projections and that between the pair of identifying recesses coincide, an erroneous buildup of the sub-housings can be prevented.<br>
The identifying recesses provided in the sub-housing in the bottommost level may be so set as to be able to receive the identifying projections provided on all the sub-housings located above the bottommost level therein.<br>
According to such a construction, the sub-housing in the bottommost level can be used as a common sub-housing even if the number of the levels of the sub-housings is changed.<br>
The projecting pieces may be formed to laterally project at rear parts of the sub-housings.<br>
According to such a construction, since the hand-push portion is formed at the rear part of the joint connector, a pushing operation can be easily performed upon connecting the joint connector with the mating housing.<br>
Accordingly, an erroneous build-up at the time of building up the sub-housings can be easily prevented without causing any reduction in strength.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a joint connector, in particular according to the above invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels,<br>
one or more cavities provided in the sub-housings and capable of at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings therein,<br>
one or more retainer insertion openings formed in mating surfaces at one side of the respective sub-housings and communicating with the insides of the respective cavities, and<br>
one or more retainers projecting from mating surfaces at the other side and at least partly insertable into the cavities through the retainer insertion openings to lock and/or retain the terminal fittings at least partly accommodated in the cavities as the respective sub-housings are built up,<br>
wherein one or more ribs are at least partly provided between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings and the retainers substantially facing the opening edges for preventing the properly built-up sub-housings from being displaced along one or more directions lying in a plane of the mating surfaces.<br>
Accordingly, displacements of built-up sub-housings are prevented while<br>
holding terminal fittings in cavities.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the one or more terminal fittings and one or more mating terminal fittings provided in a mating housing are electrically connected when the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the mating housing.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a joint connector, comprising:<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels,<br>
cavities provided in the sub-housings and capable of accommodating terminal fittings therein,<br>
retainer insertion openings formed in mating surfaces at one side of the respective sub-housings and communicating with the insides of the cavities, and<br>
retainers projecting from mating surfaces at the other side and insertable into the cavities through the retainer insertion openings to lock and retain the terminal fittings accommodated in the cavities as the respective sub-housings are built up,<br>
the terminal fittings and mating terminal fittings provided in a mating housing being electrically connected when the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the mating housing,<br>
wherein ribs are provided between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings and the retainers facing the opening edges for preventing the properly built-up sub-housings from being displaced along plane directions of the mating surfaces.<br><br>
According to such a construction, by building up the respective sub-housings, the retainers enter the cavities through the retainer insertion openings to lock and retain the terminal fittings accommodated in the cavities. Subsequently, upon connecting the built-up sub-housings with the mating housing, displacements of the respective sub-housings along the plane directions of the mating surfaces can be restricted by the ribs provided between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings and the outer circumferential surfaces of the retainers facing the opening edges. For example, even if the connecting operation is performed by pushing only the sub-housing in the bottommost level toward the mating housing, there is no likelihood that the connecting operation is completed before the sub-housing in the uppermost level reaches a proper connection position.<br>
The present invention is preferably embodied as follows.<br>
The sub-housing located at one end in a build-up direction of the sub-housings out of the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels may include at least one lock arm for holding the joint connector and the mating housing connected by being engaged with a lock portion of the mating housing. According to such a construction, the built-up sub-housings and the mating housing can be held properly connected by the engagement of the lock arm with the lock portion. For example, in the case where the uppermost sub-housing includes the lock arm, there is no likelihood that the connecting operation is completed without the lock arm being engaged with the lock portion<br>
even if the connecting operation is performed by pushing only the bottommost sub-housing toward the mating housing.<br>
The one or more retainers may have the one or more ribs formed at or near the base ends thereof, the ribs may come substantially into contact with the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings as the retainers are at least partly inserted into the retainer insertion openings, and specified clearances preferably may be set over the substantially entire circumference between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings and the retainers facing the opening edges before the ribs come substantially into contact with the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings. According to such a construction, small connecting forces at the time of the building-up operation are sufficient before the ribs come into contact with the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings at the time of building up the sub-housings.<br>
At least part of the one or more ribs, preferably each rib may include a slanted guide surface for guiding the sub-housing towards or to a proper position by coming substantially into sliding contact with the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening and/or a holding portion extending substantially in a build-up direction, preferably from the slanted guide surface, and adapted to hold the sub-housing substantially at the proper position by coming into contact with the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening. According to such a construction, the sub-housings can be guided to the proper positions by the slanted guide surfaces and can be held at the proper positions by the holding portions following the guiding operation.<br>
Accordingly, displacements of built-up sub-housings can be prevented while terminal fittings are held in cavities.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a joint connector, in particular according tothe above invention(s) or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels and can at least partly accommodate one or more terminal fittings connected with a wiring harness, and<br>
one or more guide pieces projecting from the sub-housings and at least partly insertable into one or more respective guide grooves formed in a mating housing to guide a connecting operation of the both housings when the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the mating housing,<br>
an electrical connection test as to whether or not the terminal fittings are connected with a correct wiring harness and/or whether or not the terminal fittings are properly arranged within the respective sub-housing being conducted by mounting the sub-housing before being built up in an inspection apparatus and bringing one or more conducting probes provided in or at the inspection apparatus into contact with the terminal fittings,<br>
wherein:<br>
one or more cutouts are formed in or near the leading ends of the guide pieces in different arrangements and/or different shapes for the respective sub-housing, and<br>
a detectable portion is provided to enable the identification of the type of each sub-housing by causing a detector provided separately from the conducting probes to detect the presence or absence of the cutout and/or a different shape of the cutout at the time of an electrical connection test.<br>
Accordingly, an improved operability is achieved, particularly by enabling a wiring harness to be correctly laid after sub-housings are built up.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a joint connector, comprising:<br>
sub-housings which can be built up in a plurality of levels and can accommodate terminal fittings connected with a wiring harness, and<br>
guide pieces projecting from the sub-housings and insertable into guide grooves formed in a mating housing to guide a connecting operation of the both housings when the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the mating housing,<br>
an electrical connection test as to whether or not the terminal fittings are connected with a correct wiring harness being conducted by mounting the sub-housing before being built up in an inspection apparatus and bringing conducting probes provided in the inspection apparatus into contact with the terminal fittings, and the terminal fittings being electrically connected with mating terminal fittings provided in the mating housing as the both housings are connected,<br>
wherein:<br>
cutouts are formed in the leading ends of the guide pieces in different arrangements for the respective sub-housing, and<br>
a detectable portion is provided to enable the identification of the type of each sub-housing by causing a detector provided separately from the conducting probes to detect the presence or absence of the cutout at the time of an electrical connection test.<br>
According to such a construction, the electrical connection test as to whether the terminal fittings are connected with the correct wiring harness is conducted by accommodating the terminal fittings connected with the wiring harness in the sub-housing and bringing the conducting probes into contact with the terminal fittings in the sub-housing before being built up. During this electrical connection test, the type of the sub-housing cen be identified by tne detector detecting the cutout formed in the detectable portion. Accordingly, it is possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings are accommodated in the correct sub-housing in the electrical connection test. Therefore, it can be prevented that the wiring harness is wrongly laid after the sub-housings are built up.<br>
The present invention is preferably embodied as follows.<br>
The detector may be a contact sensor, and the sensor may not be In contact if the cutout is formed while being in contact with the leading end of the guide piece if no cutout is formed. According to such a construction, tha presence or absence of the cutout can be detected using the contact sensor.<br>
The detector and/or the one or more cutouts may be provided in or on or at each of the sub-housings located at intermediate positions excluding those located at the opposite ends in a build-up direction out of the sub-housings built up in the plurality of levels. Normally, in a joint connector, sub-housings located at intermediate positions are often those buiit up and identically shaped in appearance. Thus, it could be that terminal fittings are accommodated in wrong sub-housings. Accordingly, it is not necessary to inspect all the built-up sub-housings. Inspection efficiency is improved by inspecting only the sub-housings located at the intermediate positions.<br>
Accordingly, a wiring harness can be correctly laid after sub-housings are built up.<br>

A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings. <overall construction><br>
Joint connectors 10 according to this embodiment are at least partly finable or insertable into a later-described fitting recess 22 of an intermediate connector 20 as shown in FIG. 1, One or more terminal fittings 40 connected with respective wires and/or wiring harnesses W are or can be at least partly accommodated in the joint connectors 10. If two joint connectors 10 are at least partly fitted into the respective (preferably substantially opposite) sides of the intermediate connector 20, intermediate terminals (examples of "mating terminal fittings") 24 provided in or at the intermediate connector 20 and the terminal fittings 40 are electrically connected, whereby the wires and/or wiring harnesses W connected with the two joint connectors 10 are electrically connected. Here, concerning forward and backward directions, sides to be connected are referred to as front sides based on connecting directions of the joint connectors 10 and the intermediate connector 20.<br>
One or more hand-push portions 13 to be pushed upon at least partly fitting or inserting the joint connector 10 into the intermediate connector 20 are formed at or near the rear part of each joint connector 10. One or more, preferably a pair of hand-push portions 13 are provided to project toward the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) and set to face the opening<br>
edge of the fitting recess 22 of the intermediate connector 20 with the two connectors 10, 20 properly connected as shown in FIG. 2. <construction of the joint connector><br>
Each joint connector 10 includes a built-up housing 11 made e.g. of synthetic resin, which is formed by building up one or more types, e.g. six types of sub-housings S1, S2, S3, S4, 35 and S6 (hereinafter, referred to as the "respective sub-housings S1 to S6" or merely as the sub-housings S). These sub-housings S are successively called the first sub-housing 31, the second sub-housing S2, the third sub-housing S3, the fourth sub-housing S4, the fifth sub-housing S5 and the sixth sub-housing S6 from the uppermost one in a state of being properly built up along a built up direction BUD. Here, concerning vertical direction, a direction toward the sub-housing S1 is referred to as an upward direction based on the build-up direction BUD of the respective sub-housings S.<br>
The first sub-housing S1 is provided with a lock arm 12 for holding the two connectors 10, 20 properly connected. The lock arm 12 includes a base end portion 12A standing up or projecting from (preferably substantially the front end of) the upper surface of the first sub-housing S1 and a (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) arm portion 12B extending substantially backward from the base end portion 12A and resiliency deformable substantially upward and downward. An unlocking portion 12C for unlocking the lock arm 12 is provided at or near the rear end of the arm portion 12B. Further.<br>
a lock projection 12D projecting outward or upward is formed at a position of the arm portion 12B preferably slightly before the unlocking portion 12C. <construction of the intermediate connector><br>
The intermediate connector 20 includes an intermediate housing (an<br>
example of a "mating housing") 21 made e.g. of synthetic resin, and this<br>
intermediate housing 21 is provided with two or more, preferably a pair of fitting<br>
recesses 22 preferably having open front and rear sides. An intermediate wail<br>
23 partitioning  between the  both fitting  recesses 22  is formed  in the<br>
intermediate housing 21. The intermediate terminals 24 are fixed or positioned<br>
by being arranged at least partly in (preferably by being pressed or fitted<br>
through) the intermediate wall 23 from one fitting recess 22 toward the other<br>
fitting recess 22. As shown in FIG. 5, one or more, e.g. three intermediate<br>
terminals   24   are   arranged   preferably   at   specified   (predetermined   or<br>
predeterminable) intervals in width and/or vertical direction. Further, as shown<br>
in FIG. 3, one or more, e.g. five tab-shaped terminals are vertically arranged<br>
substantially in conformity with the respective terminal fittings 40 in the second<br>
to sixth sub-housings S2, S6 at both sides in each intermediate terminal 24,<br>
and/or the vertically adjacent tab-shaped terminals  are  united  by being<br>
connected with each other, it should be understood that the fitting recesses 22<br>
may have any relative orientation, e.g. they may be arranged such as to open<br>
to substantially opposite sides of the intermediate connector 20 or they may be<br>
arranged at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal<br>
to each other thus resulting in an angled intermediate connector 20 connecting wires/wire harnesses under the respective angle..<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lock holes 25 penetrating the fitting recesses 22 in inward and outward directions are formed in the lateral (upper) surface of the intermediate housing 21. The lock projections 12D are at least partly fitted or inserted into the lock holes 25 from the insides of the fitting recesses 22 as the joint connectors 10 are at least partly fitted or inserted into the fitting recesses 22. The lock projections 12D can hold the two properly connected connectors 10, 20 retained by being engaged with the inner circumferential surfaces of the lock holes 25. It should be noted that a fixing portion 26 to be fixed to a mounting stay (not shown) fixed to a device is provided on a side surface of the intermediate housing 21.<br>
One or more guide grooves 27 preferably are formed substantially in forward and backward directions in the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the inner circumferential surface of the fitting recess 22 ot the intermediate connector 21. These one or more guide grooves 27 are formed substantially in conformity with the respective sub-housings S, and one or more guide pieces 36 projecting from the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the main bodies 30 are at least partly insertable thereinto In this way, the connecting operation of the two connectors 10, 20 can be advantageously guided. <construction of each sub-housing><br>
As shown in FIG. 6, each sub-housing S includes a (preferably substantially plate-like or flattened) main body 30 and one or more projecting pieces 31 projecting toward the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) at or near a rear part of the main body 30. Each of the second to sixth sub-housings S2 to S6 is formed with one or more, e.g. three cavities 32 penetrating substantially in forward and backward directions and preferably arranged in width direction, and the one or more terminal fittings 40 can be at least partly accommodated into these one or more cavities 32 from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind. At least one locking lance 33 is so formed at a lateral or side wall of each cavity 32 as to be resiliency deformable in a direction intersecting a direction of insertion of the terminal fitting 40 into the cavity 32 (preferably substantially in width direction), and the terminal fitting 40 can be held retained in the cavity 32 by the engagement of the locking lance 33 with the terminal fitting 40 preferably substantially from the width side.<br>
A retainer insertion opening 34 common to the one or more, e.g. three cavities 32 is formed to penetrate one surface (e.g. the upper surface) of each of the second to sixth sub-housings S2 to S6. The plurality of (e.g. three) cavities 32 communicate with the outside of the cavities 32 through the retainer insertion opening 34. On the other hand, one or more (e.g. three) retainers 35 which at least partly enter the corresponding one or more (e.g. three) cavities 32 through the retainer insertion opening 34 when each sub-housing S is properly placed are formed on or project from the mating (lower) surface of the adjacent housing SVS5 (preferably on each of the first to fifth sub-housings S1<br>
to S5). The retainers 35 can hold the terminal fittings 40 retained in the cavities 32 by being engaged with (preferably Hie rear ends of) the terminal fittings 40 at least partly inserted to substantially proper insertion positions in the cavities 32. In other words, the terminal fittings 40 preferably are held doubly retained through the engagement by the locking lances 33 and the engagement by the retainers 35.<br>
Specified (predetermined or predeterminable) clearances are set between the side walls of the retainers 35 and the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34 to reduce connection forces exerted upon building up the respective sub-housings S. However, due to the presence of these clearances, the respective sub-housings S are displaced substantially in forward and backward directions. As a result, if the two connectors 10, 20 are connected, for example, by pushing only the sixth sub-housing S6 in the bottommost level, there could occur such a situation where the sub-housings are displaced more backward toward the uppermost level and locking by the lock arm 12 cannot be effected in the first sub-housing S1 in the uppermost level. As a countermeasure, one or more ribs 35A for preventing backlash between the retainers 35 and the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34 are provided near the base ends of the retainers 35.<br>
On© or more, preferably a pair of guide pieces 36 project substantially in width direction from the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the main body 30. These guide pieces 36 are formed to be slidably at least partly insertable into one or more guide grooves 27 formed in the (preferably<br>
substantially opposite) widthwise side(s) of the inner circumferential surface of the fitting recess 22 of the intermediate housing 21 so as to be able to guide the connecting operation of the two housings 10, 20. One or more cutouts 36A for identifying the type of the sub-housing S in an inspection process before each sub-housing S is built up in the built up direction BUD preferably are formed at or near the front edges of the guide pieces 36. In this inspection process, whether or not a wiring harness W connected with the respective terminal fittings 40 is properly connected can be inspected and, by detecting the cutouts 36A preferably by using probes (not shown), whether or not the terminal fittings 40 connected with the wiring harness W are at least partly accommodated in a correct sub-housing S can be inspected.<br>
One or more, preferably four resilient locking pieces 37 projecting more upward than the upper surface of the main body 30 are provided on or at the upper surface of the guide pieces 36. The four resilient locking pieces 37 are arranged to substantially face in width direction and/or spaced apart at specified (predetermined or predeterminable) intervals in forward and backward directions. A locking claw 37A projecting substantially inwardly is provided at the projecting end of each resilient locking piece 37, and a side of the resilient locking piece 37 with the locking claw 37A is displaceable. On the other hand, engageable portions 38 engageable with the locking claws 37A of the resilient locking pieces 37 to hold or lock the vertically adjacent main bodies 30 in a built-up state are formed below the respective guide pieces 36 of the first to fifth sub-housings 31 to S5 as shown in FIG. 8.<br><erroneous buildup preventing construction of the respective sub-housings> As shown in FIG. 7, the hand-push portions 13 are formed by closely building up the respective projecting pieces 31 of the respective sub-housings S. Identifying projections A project downward (toward the adjacent sub-housing S) from the lower ones of the mating surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31, and identifying recesses B for at least partly receiving the identifying projections A therein are provided on the upper ones. These identifying projections A and identifying recesses B are substantially aligned in a build-up direction of the respective sub-housings S with the respective sub-housings S properly built up in the built up direction BUD. Therefore, intervals between the respective identifying projections A and those between the respective identifying recesses preferably are both substantially equal.<br>
Next, detailed constructions of the identifying projections A and the identifying recesses B of the respective sub-housings S are successively described from those of the first sub-housing S1. The respective identifying projections A are called first identifying projections A1, second identifying projections A2, third identifying projections A3, fourth identifying projections A4 and fifth identifying projections A5 from the top, and the respective identifying recesses B are called first identifying recesses B1, second identifying recesses B2, third identifying recesses 83, fourth identifying recesses B4 and fifth identifying recesses B5 from the top.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, one or more, preferably a pair of first identifying projections A1 are formed to project downward from the lower surfaces of the<br>
respective projecting pieces 31 of the first sub-housing S1. The first identifying projections A1 preferably have substantially L-shaped cross sections, wherein one sides of the L shapes extend forward and the other sides thereof extend inward in width direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, one or more, preferably a pair of first identifying recesses B1 are so formed in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the second sub-housing S2 as to be recessed downwardly. The respective first identifying recesses B1 have a hole shape substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the first identifying projections A1 so as to be able to at least partly receive the respective first identifying projections A1 therein. On the other hand, a pair of second identifying projections A2 are formed to project downward from the lower surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the second sub-housing S2 as shown in FIG 12. The second identifying projections A2 preferably have substantially L-shaped cross sections similar to the first identifying projections A1, but oriented differently, particularly wherein one sides of the L shapes extend backward and the other sides thereof extend inward in width direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, one or more, preferably a pair of second identifying recesses B2 are so formed in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the third sub-housing S3 as to be recessed downwardly. The respective second identifying recesses B2 have a hole shape substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the second identifying projections A2 so as to be able to at least partly receive the respective second identifying<br>
projections A2 therein. On the other hand, a pair of third identifying projections A3 are formed to project downward from the lower surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the third sub-housing S3 as shown in FIG. 14. The third identifying projections A3 preferably have substantially L-shaped cross sections similar to the first identifying projections A1, but oriented differently, particularly wherein one sides of the L shapes extend forward and the other sides thereof extend outward in width direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, one or more, preferably a pair of third identifying recesses B3 are so formed in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the fourth sub-housing S4 as to be recessed downwardly. The respective third identifying recesses B3 have a hole shape substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the third identifying projections A3 so as to be able to at least partly receive the respective third identifying projections A3 therein, On the other hand, one or more, preferably a pair of fourth identifying projections A4 are formed to project downward from the iower surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the fourth sub-housing S4 as shown in FIG. 16. The fourth identifying projections A4 have substantially L-shaped cross sections similar to the first identifying projections A1, but oriented differently, particularly wherein one sides of the L shapes extend backward and the other sides thereof extend outward in width direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, one or more, preferably a pair of fourth identifying recesses B4 are so formed in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the fifth sub-housing S5 as to be recessed downwardly. The<br>
respective fourth identifying recesses B4 have a hole shape substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the fourth identifying projections A4 so as to be able to at least partly receive the respective fourth identifying projections A4 therein. On the other hand, one or more, preferably a pair of fifth identifying projections A5 are formed to project downward from the lower surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the fifth sub-housing S5 as shown in FIG. 18. The fifth identifying projections A4 have substantially rectangular cross sections.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, one or more, preferably a pair of fifth identifying recesses B5 are so formed in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 of the sixth sub-housing S6. The respective fifth identifying recesses B5 have a hole shape substantially in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the fifth identifying projections A5 so as to be able to at least partly receive the respective fifth identifying projections A5 therein. The lengths of the sides of the fifth identifying recesses B5 preferably are set equal to or substantially larger than the lengths of the respective sides of the L-shapes of the first to fourth identifying recesses A1 to A4. Thus, the respective fifth identifying recesses 85 can at least partly accommodate not only the fifth identifying projections A5, but also any ones of the first to fourth identifying projections A1 to A4. In other words, the sixth sub-housing S6 functions as a common sub-housing that can be used in place of any one of the second to fifth sub-housings S2 to 35.<br>
Specific examples of combination are shown in FIGS. 20 to 23. FIG. 20 is a front view showing a state where the first and sixth sub-housings SI, S6 are built up along the built up direction BUD. FIG. 21 is a front view showing a state where the first, second and sixth sub-housings S1, S2 and S6 are built up. FIG. 22 is a front view showing a state where the first, second, third and sixth sub-housings S1, S2, S3 and 36 are built up. FIG. 23 is a front view showing a state where the first, second, third, fourth and sixth sub-housings S1, 82, S3, S4 and S6 are built up.<br>
Accordingly, as shown in FIGS. 10 to 19, the respective identifying projections A preferably have substantially L-shaped cross sections, and the respective identifying recesses B have hole shapes substantially in conformity with or substantially complementary to the cross-sectional shapes of the corresponding identifying projections A and can at least partly receive the corresponding identifying projections A only when the sub-housings S are properly built up in the built up direction BUD. As shown in FIG. 6, the respective identifying projections A are called first identifying projections A1, second identifying projections A2, third identifying projections A3, fourth identifying projections A4 and fifth identifying projections A5 from the top. Similar to the identifying projections A, the respective identifying recesses B are called first identifying recesses B1, second identifying recesses B2, third identifying recesses B3, fourth identifying recesses B4 and fifth identifying recesses B5 from the top. <functions of this embodiment></functions>
Next, functions of this embodiment constructed as above are described. First of all, the terminal fittings 40 connected with the wiring harness W are at least partly inserted into the specified (predetermined or predeterminable) cavities 32. After the insertion of all the terminal fittings 40 is completed, the sub-housings S are built up or stacked or arranged or placed one on top of each other along the built up direction BUD. When the first and second sub-housings S1, S2 are built up, the respective first identifying projection(s) A1 is/are at least partly accommodated into the corresponding first identifying recess(es) B1, whereby the buildup of the both sub-housings S1, S2 is permitted, Then, when the one or more locking claws 37A move over the engaging portions 38 while the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliency deformed outwardly preferably substantially in width direction, the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliently at least partly restored to engage the locking claws 37A and the engaging portions 38. In this way, the first and second sub-housings S1, S2 are held built up.<br>
Here, a case of trying to build up a wrong combination of sub-housings S is described. For example, if it is tried to build up the first and third sub-housings S1, S3 as shown in FIG. 24, the one or more bottom ends of the one or more respective first identifying projections A1 interfere with the respective opening edges of the respective second identifying recesses B2 as shown in FIG. 25, whereby the building-up operation of the both sub-housings 31, S3 is interrupted. Thus, an operator performing this building-up operation notices an erroneously built-up state, and can stop the building-up operation of the both<br>
sub-housings S1, S3 and resume the building-up operation with a correct combination.<br>
The joint connector 10 is constructed by properly building up the<br>
respective sub-housings S in this way, i.e. by arranging sub-housings S having<br>
the proper combination of identifying projections Ai and identifying recesses Bi<br>
on each other. When the building-up operation is completed and the joint<br>
connector 10 is at least partly inserted into the fitting recess 22 of the<br>
intermediate connector 20, the one or more respective guide pieces 36 are or<br>
can be at least partly inserted into the one or more corresponding guide<br>
grooves 27 to guide the connecting operation of the both connectors 10, 20.<br>
When the lock projection 12D at least partly is fitted or inserted into the lock<br>
hole 25 from the inside of the fitting recess 22 while the lock arm 12 is resiliently<br>
deformed downwardly or towards the sub-housing S1, the lock arm 12 is<br>
resiliently at least partly restored to engage the lock projection 12D with the<br>
inner circumferential surface of the lock hole 25. In this way, the joint connector<br>
10 and the intermediate connector 20 are lockingly or inseparably held.<br>
Simultaneously, the terminal fittings 40 of the joint connector 10 and the<br>
intermediate terminals 24 of the intermediate connector 20 are electrically<br>
connected. By building up and connecting the other joint connector 10 in the<br>
same manner as above, the wiring harnesses W connected with the terminal<br>
fittings 40 of the both joint connectors 10 are electrically connected with each<br>
other.<br>
As described above, the above features of the embodiment fulfil! or achieve the following effects.<br>
1.	If the sub-housings S are properly built up, the orientations of the<br>
cross-sectional shapes of the identifying projections A and those of the hole<br>
shapes of the identifying recesses B substantially coincide, so that the<br>
identifying projections A are received into the identifying recesses B. Thus, an<br>
erroneous buildup of the sub-housings S can be prevented.<br>
2.	Since the identifying projections A and the identifying recesses B<br>
are provided utilizing the hand-push portions 13 as an existing structure, the<br>
joint connector 10 can be made smaller as compared with the case where the<br>
identifying projections A and the identifying recesses B are separately provided.<br>
3.	Since the projecting pieces 31 constituting or forming part of the<br>
hand-push portions 13 are provided at or near the rear part of the sub-housings<br>
S, it is not necessary to thin the inner walls of the cavities 32, resulting in no<br>
likelihood of reducing the intensity of the joint connector 10.<br><br>
4.	Since the identifying projections A and the identifying recesses B<br>
can be substantially aligned in the build-up direction with the intervals between<br>
the respective identifying projections A and those between the respective<br>
identifying recesses B fixed, there is no likelihood of enlarging the joint<br>
connector 10 in width direction.<br>
5.	Since the sixth sub-housing S6 in the bottommost level can be<br>
used as the common sub-housing, it is not necessary to separately provide a<br>
sub-housing in the bottommost level even if the number of the levels of the joint connector 10 is changed as shown in FIGS, 20 to 23.<br>
6. Since the hand-push portions 13 are provided at or near the rear part of the joint connector 10, the joint connector 10 can be steadily pushed until the two connectors 10, 20 are properly connected upon connecting the joint connector 10 with the intermediate connector 20.<br>
Accordingly, to facilitate a building-up operation by preventing an erroneous buildup of sub-housings, a joint connector 10 is provided with a plurality of sub-housings S (S1 to S6) which can be built up in a plurality of ievels, one or more cavities 32 capable of at least partly accommodating terminal fittings 40 and one or more projecting pieces 31 provided on outer sides of the respective sub-housings S, projecting in directions intersecting with a build-up direction of the sub-housings S and forming hand-push portions 13 by building up the sub-housings S. As the sub-housings S built up in a plurality of levels are fitted into the intermediate connector 20 by pushing the hand-push portions 13 toward the intermediate connector 20, the terminal fittings 40 are electrically connected with intermediate terminals 24 provided in the intermediate connector 20. Identifying projections A are provided on the lower ones of mating surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31, and identifying recesses B for receiving the identifying projections A therein if the sub-housings S are properly built up are provided in the upper ones of the mating surfaces. <modified embodiment><br>
Next, a modified preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 26.<br>
A joint connector 50 of this embodiment is mainly differentiated from the joint connector 10 of the first embodiment by partly modifying the constructions of the identifying projections A and the identifying recesses B, and the other repeating or similar constructions, functions and effects are not described.<br>
Identifying projections A of the joint connector 50 are provided on the lower surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 and in the form of columns having substantially rectangular cross sections longer in forward and backward directions. On the other hand, identifying recesses B are respectively provided in the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 and have hole shapes in conformity with the cross-sectional shapes of the identifying projections A. If the respective sub-housings S are properly built up, the respective identifying projections A are received into the respective identifying recesses B since an interval between the respective identifying projections A and that between the respective identifying recesses B coincide. Thus, unless the respective sub-housings S are properly built up, the interval between the respective identifying projections A does not coincide with that between the respective identifying recesses B as shown in FIG. 26, wherefore the sub-housings S cannot be built up. In other words, the bottom ends of the respective identifying projections A interfere with the surface where the respective identifying recesses B are formed (upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31), whereby a building-up operation is interrupted.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, an erroneous buildup of the respective sub-housings S can be easily prevented only by setting such that the interval between the respective identifying projections A does not coincide with that between the respective identifying recesses B unless the respective sub-housings S are properly build up. In other words, unlike the first embodiment, it is not necessary to form the identifying projections A with complicated cross-sectional shapes and to set them in different orientations on the respective mating surfaces. Therefore, the identifying projections A can have simple cross sectional shapes such as substantially rectangular shapes or round shapes. <further modifications><br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiments. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims-<br>
(1)	Although the joint connectors 10, in which the respective sub-<br>
housings are built up in two to six levels, are illustrated in the  above<br>
embodiments, the present invention is also applicable to joint connectors, in<br>
which the respective sub-housings S are built up in three, four, five, seven or<br>
more levels.<br>
(2)	Although the hand-push portions 13 project toward the opposite<br>
widthwise  sides  at the   rear part  of  the  joint  connector   10  in  the  first<br>
embodiment, one hand-push portion may project only to either one of the<br>
opposite widthwise sides according to the present invention.<br>
(3)	Although the hand-push portions 13 project in width direction at<br>
the rear part of the joint connector 10 in the above embodiments, they may<br>
project backward or at any other angle according to the present invention.<br>
(4)	Although the identifying projections A are formed on the lower<br>
surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31 in the above embodiments, they<br>
may be formed on the upper surfaces of the respective projecting pieces 31<br>
according to the present invention. This point similarly applies to the identifying<br>
recesses B. in other words, the identifying projections A may be provide don<br>
one mating surface of one sub-housing and the corresponding identifying<br>
recess B is provided on a mating surface of the sub-housing S to be arranged<br>
adjacently.<br>
(5)	Although  the  identifying  projections  A   are  formed  to  have<br>
substantially L-shaped cross sections in the first embodiment, the cross-<br>
sectional shapes of the identifying projections A are  not limited to the<br>
substantially L shapes provided that they can identify correct combinations. For<br>
example, the identifying projections A may be formed to have substantially T, Z<br>
or X-shaped cross sections.<br><br>
(6)	Although the respective identifying projections A are formed<br>
laterally symmetrical on each mating surface in the above embodiments, they<br>
may be oriented in the same direction according to the present invention.<br>
(7)	Although the sixth sub-housing in the bottommost level is used as<br>
the common sub-housing in the case of changing the number of the levels of<br>
the joint connector 10 in the above embodiments, it is not always necessary to<br>
use the sub-housing in the bottommost level as the common sub-housing<br>
according to the present invention.<br><construction for preventing displacements of the respective sub-housings><br>
Next a construction for preventing displacements of the respective sub-housings S of the preferred embodiment is described with reference to FIGS. 27 to 31.<br>
Specified (predetermined or predeterminable) clearances are set over ai least part of, preferably over the substantially entire circumference between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34 and one or more of the outer peripheral walls of the retainers 35 substantially facing the opening edges to reduce connection forces exerted upon building up the respective sub-housings S. However, if these clearances are provided, the respective sub-housings S may be displaced along one or more directions lying in the plane of mating surfaces of the respective sub housings S. Thus, as shown in FIGS 27 to 31, one or more ribs 35A tor substantially filling up clearances substantially in forward and backward directions to prevent the respective sub-housings S from being displaced in forward and backward directions are provided at or near tho base ends on the front surfaces of the retainers 35.<br>
Since the ribs 35A preferably are substantially identically formed in ths respective sub-housings S, they are described, taking the first sub-housing S1 as an example. As shown in FIG. 27, each rib 35A substantially is in the form ot a vertically extending column (or extending along the build-up direction BUD) preferably substantially with a converging cross section (preferably substantially<br>
triangular cross section) and/or a bottom end corner thereof preferably is obliquely cut forward. More specifically, a slanted guide surface 35B extending obliquely forward and upward is formed at the distal (bottom) end side of the rib 35A, and a part extending upward from the front end (upper end) of the slanted guide surface 35B preferably serves as a holding portion 35C. The slanted guide surfaces 35B can guide each sub-housing S towards or substantially to a proper position by coming substantially into sliding contact with the front side of the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34 at the time of building up the sub-housings S. Further, the holding portions 35C can hold or position each sub-housing S at the substantially proper position by coming substantially into contact with the front side of the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34 following the guiding operation by the slanted guide surfaces 35B.<br>
Although the first to fifth sub-housings S1 to S5 are provided with the one or more ribs 35A and the second to sixth sub-housings S2 to S6 are formed with the one or more retainer insertion openings 34 in this embodiment, the second to sixth sub-housings S2 to S6 may be formed with the one or more ribs 35A and the first to fifth sub-housings S1 to S5 may be formed with the one or more retainer insertion openings 34. Although the ribs 35A preferably are provided on the retainers 35 in this embodiment, they may be provided on the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34 or may be provided on both the ribs 35A and the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34. Further, although the displacements of the sub-housings S substantially in<br>
forward and backward directions are restricted in this embodiment, those in width direction can additionally or alternatively be, of course, restricted. <functions of this embodiment></functions>
Next, functions of this embodiment constructed as above are described.<br>
First of all, the terminal fittings 40 connected with the wiring harness W are at least partly inserted into the specified (predetermined or predeterminable) cavities 32. After the insertion of all the terminal fittings 40 is completed, the sub-housings S are built up along the built-up direction BUD. For example, in the case of building up the first and second sub-housings SI, S2, the respective first identifying projections A1 are at least parity accommodated into or mated with the corresponding first identifying recesses B1, whereby the buildup of the both sub-housings S1, S2 is permitted.<br>
At this time, the retainers 35 of the first sub-housing S1 at least partly enter the cavities 32 through the retainer insertion opening 34 of the second sub-housing 32. Since the specified (predetermined or predeterminable) clearance is set between the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34 and the outer peripheral walls of the retainers 35 facing this opening edge, a connecting force during the building-up operation is reduced. The slanted guide surfaces 35B of the ribs 35A come or can come substantially into sliding contact with the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34, whereby each sub-housing S is guided towards or to the proper position. Subsequently, the holding portions 35C of the ribs 35A preferably come substantially into<br>
contact with the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34, whereby each sub-housing S is held or located or positioned at the proper position.<br>
Substantially in parallel with these operations, the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliency at least partly restored to engage the locking claws 37A and the engaging portions 38 when the locking claws 37A move over the engaging portions 38 while the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliency deformed outwardly preferably substantially in width direction. Thus, the sub-housings S are held or positioned in a built-up state. After being constructed by properly building up the respective sub-housings S in this way, the joint connector 10 is or can be at least partly inserted into the fitting recess 22 of the intermediate connector 20.<br>
At this time, the one or more respective guide pieces 36 are at least partly inserted into the one or more corresponding guide grooves 27 to guide the connecting operation of the two connectors 10, 20. Further, when the lock projection 12D is at least partly fitted into the lock hole 25 (preferably substantially from the inside of the fitting recess 22) while the lock arm 12 iy resiliency deformed inwardly or downwardly, the lock arm 12 is resiliency ai least partly restored to engage the lock projection 12D with the inner circumferential surface of the lock hole 25. In this way, the joint connector 10 and the intermediate connector 20 are inseparably held, and the terminal fittings 40 of the joint connector 10 and the intermediate terminals 24 of the intermediate connector 20 are electrically connected. By building up and connecting the other joint connector 10 in the same manner as above, the<br>
wiring harnesses W connected with the terminal fittings 40 of the both joint connectors 10 are electrically connected with each other.<br>
Accordingly, to prevent displacements of sub-housings, a joint connector is provided with two or more sub-housings S which can be built up in a plurality of levels, one or more cavities 32 provided in the sub-housings S and capable of at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings 40 therein, one or more retainer insertion openings 34 formed in mating surfaces at one side of the respective sub-housings and communicating with the insides of the one or more respective cavities 32, one or more retainers 35 projecting from mating surfaces at the other side and at least partly insertable into the respective cavities 32 through the one or more retainer insertion openings 34 to lock and/or retain the terminal fittings 40 at least partly accommodated in the cavities 32 as the respective sub-housings S are built up, and one or more ribs 35A provided between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34 and the retainers 35 substantially facing the opening edges for preventing the properly built-up sub-housings S from being displaced in one or more directions lying in the plane (or along plane directions) of the mating surfaces.<br>
As described above, the above features of the embodiment fulfill or achieve the following effects.<br>
1. By preferably utilizing the one or more retainers 35 for retaining the terminal fittings 40 and providing the one or more ribs 35A on at least part of these retainers 35, the displacements of the sub-housings S can be restricted. For example, even if the connecting operation is performed by<br>
pushing only the sixth sub-housing 36 toward the intermediate connector 20, since the displacements of the sub-housings S are restricted, there can be prevented a situation where the connecting operation is completed before the lock arm 12 of the first sub-housing S1 reaches the proper connection position and the lock projection 12D is left without being fitted in the lock hole 25.<br>
2.	Before the ribs 35A come into contact with the opening edges of<br>
the   retainer   insertion   openings   34,   the   specified   (predetermined   or<br>
predeterminable) clearances preferably are set between the opening edges of<br>
the retainer insertion openings 34 and the outer peripheral walls of the retainers<br>
35 facing these opening edges. Thus, connection forces exerted upon building<br>
up the respective sub-housings S can be reduced.<br>
3.	The slanted guide surfaces 35B of the ribs 35A preferably come<br>
substantially into sliding contact with the opening edges of the retainer insertion<br>
openings 34 at the time of building up the respective sub-housings S, whereby<br>
the respective sub-housings S can be guided to the proper positions. Following<br>
this guiding operation, the holding portions 35C of the ribs 35A come into<br>
contact with the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34, whereby<br>
the respective sub-housings S can be held at the proper positions.<br><br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
(1)	Although the ribs 35A are provided integral to the sub-housings S<br>
in the above embodiment, they may be provided separately from the sub-<br>
housings S according to the present invention.<br>
(2)	Although the ribs 35A project at the base ends of the retainers 35<br>
in the above embodiment, they may be formed to be longer in the lengthwise<br>
directions of the retainers 35 according to the present invention. In other words,<br>
the specified clearances may not necessarily be provided over the entire<br>
circumference between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34<br>
and the outer peripheral walls of the retainers 35 facing the opening edges.<br>
(3)	Although the ribs 35A include the slanted guide surfaces 35B in<br>
the above embodiment, slanted guide surfaces may be provided on the<br>
opening edges of the retainer insertion openings 34 according to the present<br>
invention or may be provided on both the ribs 35A and the opening edges of<br>
the retainer insertion openings 34.<br><construction for detecting the erroneous mounting of sub-housing><br>
Next a construction for detecting the erroneous mounting of one or more sub-housings S of the preferred embodiment is described with reference to FIGS. 34 to 37.<br>
Before the sub-housings S are built up, an electrical connection test preferably is conducted to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are connected with a correct wiring harness W. This electrical connection test may be conducted by bringing one or more (e.g. three) conducting probes E provided in an inspection apparatus (not shown) into contact with the front ends<br>
of the respective terminal fittings 40 as shown in FIGS. 34 to 37. in this electrical connection test, it is possible to inspect or verify whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are connected with the correct wiring harness W, but not possible to inspect or verify whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are at least partly accommodated in the correct sub-housing S. Accordingly, in the inspection apparatus of this embodiment, at least one pair of contact probes (example of a preferred "detector") C are provided in addition to the conducting probe E in order to detect the erroneous mounting of the sub-housing S.<br>
The inspection apparatus includes an inspection unit as an integral or unitary assembly of the conducting probe E and the contact probes C, a mounting portion in which the sub-housing S before being built up is mounted, and an operation lever for bringing the inspection unit toward and away from the sub-housing S mounted in the mounting portion. Each contact probe C includes a contact sensor, and a detection signal is sent to a controller (not shown) when an object comes into contact with this sensor. The controller judges or determines the presence or absence of the cutout 36A based on the detection signal sent from the contact probe C.<br>
On the other hand, detectable portions to be detected by the contact probes C are located at or near the front ends of the guide pieces 36 of the second to fifth sub-housings 32 to 35. The contact probes C detect the detectable portions to identify the type of the sub-housing S, thereby making it possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are accommodated in the correct sub-housing S.<br>
Here, the constructions of the detectable portions are specifically described for each sub-housing S.<br>
As shown in RG. 34, no cutout 36A is formed at the front ends of the both guide pieces 36 in the second sub-housing S2. Thus, the both contact probes C are in contact with the front ends of the both guide pieces 36, whereby detection signals are sent to the controller.<br>
As shown in FIG, 35, the cutout 36A is formed only in the shown upper guide piece 36 in the third sub-housing S3, Thus, the shown upper contact probe C is not in contact with the surrounding wall where the cutout A is formed, but the shown lower contact probe C is in contact with the front end of the guide piece 36 and a detection signal is sent to the controller.<br>
As shown in FIG. 36, the cutouts 36A are formed in the front ends of the both guide pieces 36 in the fourth sub-housing S4. Thus, the both contact probes C are not in contact with the surrounding wall where the cutouts 36A are<br>
formed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 37, the cutout 36A is formed only in the shown lower guide piece 36 in the fifth sub-housing S5. Thus, the shown lower contact probe C is not in contact with the surrounding wall where the cutout 36A is formed, but the shown upper contact probe C is in contact with the front end of the guide piece 36 and a detection signal is sent to the controller.<br>
The controller includes one or more storage means (not shown) storing the presence or absence and/or position of the cutout 36A and the type of the sub-housing S in correspondence and judging means (not shown) for judging<br>
whether or not the sub-housing is a correct one by referring to the storage means. Thus, at the time of an electrical connection test, it is possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are connected with the correct wiring harness W by the conducting probes E and to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are accommodated in the proper sub-housing S by the contact probes C. Upon conducting an electrical connection test for the sixth sub-housing S6, it is possible to switch to an inspection mode in which the inspection by the contact probes C is not conducted. <functions of this embodiment></functions>
Next, functions of this embodiment constructed as above are described.<br>
First of all, the one or more terminal fittings 40 connected with the wiring harness W are at least partly inserted into the one or more respective cavities 32. After the insertion of all the terminal fittings 40 is completed, electrical connection tests are (separately or in parallel) conducted for the second to sixth sub-housings S2 to S6 before the buildup. When each sub-housing 32 to S6 is mounted in the mounting portion of the inspection apparatus and the operation lever is operated (rotated or displaced), the inspection unit approaches the sub-housing S mounted in the mounting portion and the conducting probe(s) E come into contact with the front ends of the respective terminal fitting(s) 40, thereby inspecting whether or not the terminal fitting(s) 40 are connected w th the correct wiring harness W. Simultaneously, the detectable portions are detected by the contact probes C to judge or determine the presence or absence of the cutout 36A, and whether or not the terminal titting(s) 4C is/are a1.<br>
least partly accommodated in the correct sub-housing S is judged by referring to the storage means.<br>
After the electrical connection tests for part or preferably all the sub-housings S2 to S6 are completed, the sub-housings S are built up. For example, in the case of building up the first and second sub-housings S1, 32, the respective first identifying projections A1 are at least partly accommodated into the corresponding first identifying recesses B1, whereby the buildup of the both sub-housings S1, S2 is permitted. At this time, the one or more retainers 35 of the first sub-housing S1 at least partly enter the one or more cavities 32 through the (respective) retainer insertion opening 34 of the second sub-housing S2. The respective sub-housings S1, S2 preferably are held or positioned at substantially proper positions by the contact of the ribs 35A with the opening edge of the retainer insertion opening 34.<br>
Substantially in parallel with these operations, the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliency at least partly restored to engage the locking claws 37A and the engaging portions 38 when the locking claws 37A move over the engaging portions 38 while the resilient locking pieces 37 are resiliently deformed outwardly in width direction. Thus, the sub-housings S preferably are held or located or positioned in a built-up state. After being constructed by properly building up the respective sub-housings S in this way, the joint connector 10 is inserted into the fitting recess 22 of the intermediate connector 20.<br>
At this time, the one or more respective guide pieces 36 are at least partly inserted into the one or more corresponding guide grooves 27 to guide<br>
the connecting operation of the two connectors 10, 20. Further, when the lock projection 12D preferably is at least partly fitted or inserted into the lock hole 25 (preferably from the inside of the fitting recess 22) while the lock arm 12 is resiliently deformed inwardly or downwardly, the lock arm 12 is resiliently at least partly restored to engage the lock projection 12D with the inner circumferential surface of the lock hole 25. In this way, the joint connector 10 and the intermediate connector 20 preferably are inseparably held, and the terminal fittings 40 of the joint connector 10 and the intermediate terminals 24 of the intermediate connector 20 are electrically connected. By building up and connecting the other joint connector 10 in the same manner as above, the wiring harnesses W connected with the terminal fittings 40 of the both joint connectors 10 are electrically connected with each other.<br>
As described above, this embodiment fulfills or achieves the following effects.<br>
1.	By detecting the type of the sub-housing S utilizing the guide<br>
pieces 36, it is possible to inspect whether or not the terminal fittings 40 are at<br>
least partly accommodated in the correct sub-housing S and/or in the correct<br>
arrangement in the electrical connection test conducted before the building-up<br>
operation. Accordingly, the wiring harness W can be correctly laid after the<br>
buildup of the sub-housings S.<br>
2.	The presence or absence of the cutouts 36A formed in the front<br>
ends of the guide pieces can be easily detected by employing the contact<br>
probes C as contact sensors.<br>
3.       Since the detectable portions preferably are provided only on the second to fifth sub-housings S2 to S5 to conduct the inspection by the contact probes C, the inspection can be more efficient. <further embodiment><br>
Next, a further preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 38 An inspection apparatus of this embodiment is so constructed as to be able to detect one or more detectable portions of sub-housings S by their shapes and/or arrangements. Here, the fourth sub-housing S4 is described as an example. Specifically, the inspection apparatus of this embodiment includes a housing accommodating portion 50 capable of accommodating the sub-housing S4 and one or more, preferably a pair of projections (example of the preferred "detector") provided on the back wall of the housing accommodating portion 50 in conformity with the cutouts 36A. Then, it can be detected that the sub-housing being inspected is the sub-housing S4 if the sub-housing S4 at least partly inserted into the housing accommodating portion 50 can be pushed to the back end of the housing accommodating portion 50. On the other hand, if the detectable portions (front ends of the both guide pieces 36) interfere with the both projections 51 and the sub-housing cannot be pushed to the back end of the housing accommodating portion 50 when an attempt is made to insert the sub-housing S (e.g. second sub-housing S2) other than the fourth sub-housing S4 into this housing accommodating portion 50, it can be detected that this sub-housing is not the fourth sub-housing S4.<br>
Accordingly, to enable a wiring harness to be correctly laid after sub-housings are built up, a joint connector is provided with sub-housings S which can be built up in a plurality of levels and can at least partly accommodate one or more terminal fittings 40 connected with a wiring harness W, one or more guide pieces 36 projecting from the sub-housings S and at least partly msertable into one or more respective guide grooves 27 formed in an intermediate housing 21 to guide a connecting operation of both housings 11, 21 when the sub-housings S built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the intermediate housing 21, one or more cutouts 36A formed in the leading ends of the guide pieces 36 in different arrangements for the respective sub-housings S, and detectable portions for enabling the identification of the type of the sub-housing S by causing one or more contact probes C provided separately from one or more conducting probes E to detect the presence or absence of the cutouts 36A at the time of an electrical connection test.<br><modifications><br>

providing sub-housings (S) which can be built up in a plurality of levels, wherein one or more projecting pieces (31) are provided on outer sides of the respective sub-housings (S), projecting in a direction intersecting with a build-up direction (BUD) of the sub-housings (S),<br>
at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings (40) into one or more respective cavities (32) provided in the respective sub-housings (S), and<br>
building up the plurality of sub-housings (S) along a build-up direction (BUD), wherein the proper building up is accomplished by at least partly receiving one or more identifying projections (A) provided on mating surfaces at one side of the respective projecting pieces (31) in one or more identifying recesses (B) provided in mating surfaces at the other side, while an erroneous building up of the sub-housings (S) is avoided by the interference of the identifying projection(s) (A) and the identifying recess(es) (B).<br>
16.	A  method  of assembling  a joint connector,  comprising  the<br>
following steps:<br>
providing sub-housings (S) which can be built up in a plurality of levels, wherein one or more retainer insertion openings (34) are formed in mating surfaces at one side of the respective sub-housings (S),<br>
at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings (40) into one or more respective cavities (32) provided in the respective sub-housings (S), wherein the cavities (32) communicate the one or more retainer insertion openings (34), and<br>
building up the plurality of sub-housings (S) along a build-up direction (BUD), whereby one or more retainers (35) projecting from mating surfaces at the other side are at least partly inserted into the cavities (32) through the retainer insertion openings (34) to lock and/or retain the terminal fittings (40) at least partly accommodated in the cavities (32),<br>
wherein one or more ribs (35A) are at least partly provided between the opening edges of the retainer insertion openings (34) and the retainers (35) substantially facing the opening edges for preventing the properly built-up sub-housings (S) from being displaced along one or more directions lying in a plane of the mating surfaces.<br>
17. A method of assembling a joint connector, comprising the following steps:<br>
providing sub-housings (S) which can be built up in a plurality of levels,<br>
at least partly accommodating one or more terminal fittings (40) connected with a wiring harness (W) in the respective sub-housing (S), and<br>
building up the plurality of sub-housings (S) along a build-up direction (BUD),<br>
assembling the built up sub-housings (S) with a mating housing (21), whereby one or more guide pieces (36) projecting from the sub-housings (S)<br>
are at least partly inserted into one or more respective guide grooves (27) formed in a mating housing (21) to guide a connecting operation of the both housings when the sub-housings (S) built up in the plurality of levels is connected with the mating housing (21), and<br>
performing an electrical connection test as to whether or not the terminal fittings (40) are connected with a correct wiring harness (W) and/or whether or not the terminal fittings (40) are properly arranged within the respective sub-housing (S) being conducted by mounting the sub-housing (S) before being built up in an inspection apparatus (51) and bringing one or more conducting probes (E) provided in or at the inspection apparatus (C) into contact with the terminal fittings (40),<br>
wherein:<br>
one or more cutouts (36A) are formed in or near the leading ends of the guide pieces (36) in different arrangements and/or different shapes for the respective sub-housing (S), and<br>
a detectable portion is provided to enable the identification of the type of each sub-housing (S) by causing a detector (C) provided separately from the conducting probes (E) to detect the presence or absence of the cutout (3SA) arid/or a different shape of the cutout (36A) at the time of an electrical connection test.<br></modifications></further></construction></construction></further></modified></erroneous></construction></construction></construction></overall></td>
