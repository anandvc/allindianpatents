				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of 2H-1-benzopyrans by converting aliphatic aldehydes with aliphatic alcohols in the presence of a dehydrating compound and an aluminium oxide/silicium oxide catalyst in a first stage into aliphatic acetals and their further reaction in a second stage with phenols in the presence of a base in an inert organic solvent. 2H-l-benzopyrans are important intermediate or final products in the production of pharmaceuticals (North et al., J.O.C., 60.3397, 1995; Bell et al, Synthesis, 707, 1995) for example in the production of pyranylcyanoguanidines, used in the treatment of epilepsy and migraine (EP-A O 629 619).<br>
The 2H-l-benzopyrans which can be produced according to the invention have the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 is hydrogen, a (C1-C4) alkyl group, R2 is hydrogen, a (C1-C6) alkyl group and RJ is hydrogen, a (C1-C4) alkyl group, a (C1-C4) haloalkyl group, a (C2-C4) alkenyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxycarbonyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxymethyl group, a (Cr C4) alkanoyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxy group, a (C1-C4) alkylsulphonyl group, halogen, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, nitril, nitro or hydroxy.<br>
The production of acetals using aluminium oxide/silicium oxide catalysts has been described in the literature on the basis of ketones (Thuy et Matte, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 11. 2558; 1975) and on the basis of paraformaldehyde (Deshmukh et al., Synth. Commun. 25, 3939; 1995). The disadvantage of these methods of synthesis known from the literature is the high proportion of catalyst in relation to the starting products which is used in the synthesis.<br>
Compounds with the general formula I and processes to produce such compounds are listed in the European Patent Application EP-A 0 629 619. For<br>
example this application describes a process where 3-methyl-crotonaldehyde is reacted with an aliphatic alcohol, a dehydrating agent and alternatively sodium hydrogen sulphate, potassium hydrogen sulphate or quartemary ammoaium hydrogen sulphate as the catalyst, and the purified acetal obtained is then condensed with a phenol in the presence of a tertiary amine in an inert organic solvent. The disadvantage of this process is that large quantities of potassium carbonate are needed for the processing of the acetal, and in the second stage large quantities of the catalytic tertiary amine are used, in relation to the educts.<br>
The task of the present invention was therefore to provide an improved process whereby compounds with the general formula I can be produced economically.<br>
Therefore,   the   present  invention   provides   for  a  process   for   the production of 2H- 1-benzopyrans of the general formula<br>
where R1 is hydrogen, a (C1-C4) alkyl group, R2 is hydrogen, a (C1-C6) alkyl group and R3 is hydrogen, a (C1-C4) alkyl group, a (C1-C4) haloalkyl group, a (C2-C4) alkenyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxycarbonyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxymethyl group, a (C1-C4) alkanoyl group, a (C1-C4) alkoxy group, a (C1-C4) alkylsulphonyl group, halogen, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, nitril, nitro or hydroxy, wherein said process comprises the steps of (a)      reacting an aliphatic aldehyde of the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 and R2 have the above-mentioned meaning, with an aliphatic alcohol of the formula R4OH or HOR4OH, where R4 is a (C1-C4) alkyl group or a (C2-C4) alkyldiyl group -40 to 40째C, in the presence of a dehydrating compound of the formula HC(OR5)3, where R5 is a (C1-C4) alkyl group, and an aluminium oxide/silicium oxide catalyst to form an aliphatic acetal of the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 and R2 have the above-mentioned meaning and R4 as stated above is a (C1-C4) alkyl group or the two R4 together are a cyclical (C2-C4) alkyldiyl group, and the compound of formula III is optionally isolated by conventional method; and<br>
(b) condensing the compound of formula III at 90 to 180째C with a phenol of the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R3 has the above-mentioned meaning, in the presence of a base in an inert organic solvent both of the kind such as herein described, to obtain the product of the general formula I.<br>
According to the invention this problem is solved by the process according to patent claim 1. In this in a first stage aliphatic aldehydes with the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 and'R have the meaning stated above, are converted with an aliphatic alcohol with the formula R4OH or HOR4OH, where R4 is a (C1-C4) alkyl group or a (C2-C4) alkyldiyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating compound with the formula HC(OR5)3, where Rs is a (C1-C4) alkyl group, and of an aluminium oxide/silicium oxide catalyst, into an aliphatic acetal with the general formula<br>
