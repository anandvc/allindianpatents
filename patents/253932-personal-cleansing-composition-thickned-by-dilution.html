COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
PERSONAL CLEANSING COMPOSITION THICKENED BY DILUTION<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
PERSONAL  CLEANSING  COMPOSITION  THICKENED  BY  DILUTION<br>
BACKGROUND  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
1.	Field  of  the   Invention<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions suitable for topical application for cleansing the human body, such as the skin and hair. In particular, it relates to dilution thickened personal cleansing compositions.<br>
2.	Background of the Art<br>
Commercially available liquid personal washing compositions, i.e. shower gels, facial and hand cleansers that are low in viscosity are generally applied to the skin with an implement to enable vigorous cleansing.  Such implements include a pouf, sponge, cloth or brush and the like.  These low viscosity products are advantageous since they are easily dispensed and can be easily applied to or with such implements. Frequently however implements are not available for use or are inconvenient to use depending on the circumstances. Surprisingly an easily dispensed, low viscosity cleansing product has been discovered that thickens appreciably with water dilution to create a substantially thickened product with sufficient solubility/dispersibility in water.  This product shows enhanced adhesion to the skin and acts as in-situ implement which obviates the need for a separate implement for the vigorous cleansing of the skin.<br><br>
Dilution thickening cleansers are known that have liquid crystal structure.  PCT publication no. WO 94/16680 discloses the use of an electrolyte and high levels of water and synthetic detergents including ethoxylated alcohols to form a viscous structured liquid crystalline lamellar phase in the undiluted product.  Polaxamers are generally mentioned as optional components.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 6919303 issued to Pham on Jul 19, 2005 discloses a process for making a single phase dilution thickening composition comprising electrolyte and defined associative thickeners including: Rewoderm® LIS75, (PEG-200 glyceryl tallowate); Rheodol® (tristearate modified PEG) and Elfacos® T212 (carbamic acid diester of the polyoxypropylene, polyoxyethylene ether of the fatty alcohols derived from palm kernel oil); ethylene glycol ether of ethylene cellulose (hydroxyethyl ethylcellulose) such as Elfacos® CD481; or ethyl glycol ether of methyl cellulose, such as Methocel® 40-10.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 6617293 issued to Chen on Sep 9, 2003 discloses a concentrated liquid soap composition that readily increases in viscosity upon dilution with water, the concentrated liquid soap composition containing an amine oxide surfactant; an anionic surfactant; an electrolyte; water; and a buffering agent, sufficient to maintain the pH of the composition between about 8 and about 10.<br>

composition is in the range of about 1 Pa●s  to  25,000<br>
Pa●s at 10-1 s-1at 25°C as measured using the Standard<br>
Viscosity Method described below.<br>
Advantageously the inventive cleansing composition has at least one phase with a delta viscosity value of greater than about 10,000 Pa●s (preferably a maximum of about 50K, 75K or 100 000) when blended with an equal amount by weight of water using the Standard Viscosity Method.<br>
Preferably the composition further includes about 0 to 10% by wt. of total hydrophilic emollient(s) and about 0 to 10% by wt. of total hydrophobic emollient(s), wherein the combined concentration of the hydrophilic emollient(s) and hydrophobic emollient(s) is not zero.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the water soluble block copolymer(s) has a mean number average molecular weight range of from about 1,000 to 20,000 (preferably having a minimum of 2,000 or 3,000 and maximum of  7,000 or 8,000). Preferably at least one of the water soluble block copolymer(s) has the structure according to formula I: (I) HO(CH2CH20)x(CH(CH3)CH20)y(CH2CH20)x H (wherein the<br>
average value of x  is 10 or more and the average value of y is 30 or more with a preferred range for x of 15 to 50 and a preferred range of y of 50 to 80.<br>
Advantageously the inventive composition has a ratio of total hydrophobic to total hydrophilic emollient(s) of from 10 to  0.1. (preferably the ratio is in the range of 8 to 0.12 and more preferably in the range of 6 to 0.16). Preferably the hydrophobic emollient(s) (skin conditioning agent(s)) are selected from glyceride oils, mineral oils, silicone oils or blends and derivatives thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the anionic surfactants are selected from the class of surfactants with a Krafft temperature of less than 20°C. Examples include but are not limited to SLES, ALS, Amine Oxides, and betaines and the like.  Preferably the ratio of total amphoteric surfactant to total anionic surfactant can range from 1 to 10.<br>
Advantageously the inventive composition further includes at least 0.1 % by wt. of an active agent.<br><br>
In another aspect of the invention is a prefilled dispenser and packaged product for dispensing a thickened cleansing composition, comprising:<br>
a.	a chamber with at least one outlet; and<br>
b.	the inventive cleansing composition contained within the<br>
chamber.<br>
Advantageously the dispenser further contains an inlet adapted for admitting water into the chamber.<br>
Isotropic solution, microemulsion or emulsion compositions<br>
In contrast to liquid crystal structured surfactant solutions described below, the inventive solution, dispersion, emulsion and microemulsion compositions are substantially isotropic in nature.  In the case where the inventive composition is an emulsions, it is useful to note that emulsions are dispersions of two or more immiscible phases. These phases can be liquid, solid or liquid crystalline in nature, and be isotropic or anisotropic in nature. The inventive composition is further characterized in a preferred embodiment as an isotropic solution but may contain up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 or 50% by volume of dispersed components where only the dispersed components have ordered liquid crystalline structures as measured by the procedure outlined below or its equivalent.<br>
Ordered Liquid Crystalline Compositions:<br>
The rheological behavior of all surfactant solutions, including liquid cleansing solutions, is strongly dependent<br><br>
on the microstructure, i.e., the shape and concentration of micelles or other self-assembled structures in solution. When there is sufficient surfactant to form micelles (concentrations above the critical micelle concentration or CMC), for example, spherical, cylindrical (rod-like) or discoidal micelles may form.  As surfactant concentration increases, ordered liquid crystalline phases such as lamellar phase, hexagonal phase or cubic phase may form. Although not wishing to be bound to the following theory, it is believed that a cubic phase forms when the substantially isotropic composition of the invention is diluted with water, thus causing a significant increase in viscosity for the inventive composition.<br>
Surfactants:<br>
Surfactants are an essential component of the inventive cleansing composition.  They are compounds that have hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions that act to reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solutions they are dissolved in.  Useful surfactants can include anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, and cationic surfactants, and blends thereof.<br>
Anionic Surfactants:<br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention contains one or more anionic detergents.  Anionic surfactants are preferably used at levels as low as 20 or 30% by wt. and at levels as high as 40,   50 or 60% by wt.  The anionic detergent active which may be used may be aliphatic sulfonates, such as<br><br>

At least 75% of the mixed fatty acids have from 12 to 18 carbon atoms and up to 25% have from 6 to 10 carbon atoms.<br><br>
The acyl isethionate may be an alkoxylated isethionate such as is described in Ilardi et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,393,466, titled "Fatty Acid Esters of Polyalkoxylated isethonic acid; issued February 28, 1995; hereby incorporated by reference. This compound has the general formula:<br>

WATER SOLUBLE BLOCK COPOLYMER<br>
An essential component of compositions according to the invention is a water soluble block copolymer. This is a block copolymer based on polyethyleneoxide (EO) and polypropyleneoxide (PO) blocks. The number average molecular weight of the block copolymer is suitably in the range 1000 -20000 unified atomic mass units or more, preferably in the range 1000-10000, more preferably in the range 1000-8000, most preferably in the range 2000-7000.<br>
The mean molecular weight is suitably measured by determining the hydroxyl number for the polymer, then transforming this into molecular weight. This corresponds to a number based mean molecular weight.<br>
Each block of EO in the surface active block copolymer molecule suitably consists of 2 or more of the respective monomer units, preferably of 4 or more, more preferably of 6 or more, even more preferably of 10 or more and most preferably of 15 or more monomer units.  Each block of PO in the surface active block copolymer molecule suitably consists of 10 or more of the respective monomer units, preferably of 20 or more, more preferably of 30 or more, even more preferably of 40 or more and most preferably of 50 or more monomer units.<br>
Suitable EO/PO block copolymers according to formula I have the; CTFA designation Poloxamer. These are commercially<br><br>
available under the trade name "Pluronic" from BASF (New Jersey and Germany).<br>

In formula A, the degree of polymerization, x, is indicated as the same for each polyethyleneoxide block. This is also the case in formula B for a and b for the EO and PO blocks respectively. For the sake of clarity, it should be explained that these degrees of polymerization are mean values and are approximately the same rather than identical for any particular formula. This is a result of the polymerization methods used for production of the compounds and known to those skilled in the art of polymer synthesis.<br><br>
Suitably, the level of water soluble block copolymer is from 1 to 80 % by weight of the composition, preferably from 2, 3, 4 or 5 %, preferably having a maximum concentration of 50, 60 or 70 %.<br>

Amphoteric surfactants are preferably used at levels as low as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5% by wt. and at levels as high as 20, 30 or 40 % by wt.  Such surfactants include at least one acid group.  This may be a carboxylic or a sulphonic acid group.  They include quaternary nitrogen and therefore are quaternary amido acids.  They should generally include an alkyl or alkenyl group of 7 to 18 carbon atoms. They will usually comply with an overall structural formula:<br>
Rl-[-C(O)-NH (CH2)n-]m-N+-(R2) (R3)X-Y<br>

R1   -   CONH(CH2)n-N+-    (R2) (R3)CH2CO2<br>
where  n  is  2  or  3.<br>
In both formulae R1, R2 and R3 are as defined previously.  R1 may in particular be a mixture of C12 and C14 alkyl groups derived from coconut oil so that at least half, preferably at least three quarters of the groups R1 have 10 to 14 carbon atoms.  R2 and R3 are preferably methyl.<br>
A further possibility is that the amphoteric detergent is a sulphobetaine of formula:<br>
R1-N+- (R2) (R3) (CH2)3SO3-<br>
Or<br>
R1 - CONH(CH2)m-N+- (R2) (R3)  (CH2)3SO3-<br>
where m is 2 or 3, or variants of these in which -(CH2)3 SO3-is replaced by<br><br>
-CH2C(OH) (H)CH2SO3-<br>
In these formulae R1, R2 and R3 are as discussed previously.<br>
Amphoacetates and diamphoacetates are also intended to be covered in possible zwitterionic and/or amphoteric compounds which may be used such as e.g., sodium lauroamphoacetate, sodium cocoamphoacetate, and blends thereof, and the like.<br>
The combination of total anionic, nonionic, amphoteric surfactants and water-soluble block co-polymer(s) should preferably be more than 40% in the mixture.<br>
Cationic Skin Conditioning Agents<br>
A useful component in compositions according to the invention is a cationic skin feel agent or polymer, such as for example cationic celluloses. Cationic polymers are preferably used at levels as  low as about 1 to 2 % and at levels as  high as about 4 to 5 % by wt.  Cationic cellulose is available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, NJ, USA) in their Polymer JR (trade mark) and LR (trade mark) series of polymers, as salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with trimethy1 ammonium substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 10. Another type of cationic cellulose includes the polymeric quaternary ammonium salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with lauryl dimethyl ammonium-substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 24. These materials are available from<br><br>
Amerchol Corp. (Edison, NJ, USA) under the tradename Polymer LM-200.<br>

Sample CC with 50% water added (50 grams of the composition and 50 grams water) has a viscosity of 3887 Pa»s at 10-1 s-1at 25 C as measured by an Ares Rheometer, 25 mm parallel plate. Therefore, for sample CC, a delta viscosity (between the pre-dilution viscosity and the highest viscosity phase) at<br>
10-1 s-2at 25 C of 3474 Pa●s was measured.<br>
SAMPLE PREPARATION METHOD:<br>
Examples 1-3 and 5 were prepared as follows:<br>
Respective compositions according to examples 1- 3 and 5 were weighed into a glass beaker and mixed using an overhead mixer at 10 rpm and 2 5C for 5 minutes or until well blended.<br><br>
Methods:<br>
A)	Standard Viscosity  Method<br>
Measure the viscosity of the sample at 10-1s-1at 25 C using the Ares Rheometer, 25 mm parallel plate obtainable from TA Instruments in Delaware, USA or an equivalent thereof.<br>
B)	Delta Viscosity Method:<br>
1.	Measure the pre-dilution viscosity of the sample using the Standard Viscosity Method.<br>
2.	Add 50 gram of water to 50 gram of sample in a 250 ml glass beaker.<br>
3.	Blend the sample and added water for 5 minutes using an overhead mixer at 10 rpm and 25 C.<br>
4.	Measure the post dilution viscosity of the most viscous phase of the sample using the Standard Viscosity Method.<br>
5.	Calculate the delta viscosity by subtracting the pre-dilution viscosity from the post dilution viscosity of the most viscous phase.<br>
C)	Krafft point<br>
The Krafft point of a surfactant is defined as the temperature (or more precisely, the narrow temperature range) above which the solubility of a surfactant rises sharply. At this temperature the solubility of the surfactant becomes equal to the critical micelle concentration, it may be determined by locating the abrupt change in slope of a graph of the logarithm of the<br><br>
solubility against temperature or 1/T or can be rapidly estimated using the rapid estimation procedure described below.<br>
Krafft point determination<br>
Make up a 10 % by wt. solution of surfactant or other sample in water.  If needed, heat the system to dissolve the sample completely.  Transfer the clear solution to a glass test tube.  Place the test tube in a beaker equipped with a stirrer and filled with sufficient water to evenly cool the surfactant or sample solution-  The solution should be cooled with continuous stirring and the temperature should be continuously recorded.  Note the temperature when the crystallization process begins such that the solution becomes turbid.  This temperature is taken as the Krafft point.  If the crystallization temperature is below room temperature, add ice to the beaker to cool the test tube below room temperature to measure the subambient Krafft point.<br>
D)  Determination of volume percent of liquid crystal structured phase.<br>
Place the sample in a 50 ml test tube with volume graduations.<br>
Centrifuge the sample for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm and 25 C. After centrifugation, the volume percent occupied by the separated liquid crystal phase can be calculated by dividing the volume occupied by the separated liquid crystal phase by the total sample volume and multiplying by 100.  If<br><br>
necessary, the separated liquid crystal phase can be identified by optical birefringence techniques or other techniques well known in the art.  This phase is often more dense then the isotropic phase and is therefore usually at the bottom layer.   If particles are present, these will also separate out during centrifugation and this separated particle layer may be separately accounted for in the calculation.<br><br>
