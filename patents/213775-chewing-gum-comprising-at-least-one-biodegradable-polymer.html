				<td>CHEWING GUM COMPRISING AT LEAST ONE BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention  relates to a chewing gum comprising  at least one biodegradable polymer.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A problem of the above described prior art biodegradable chewing gum is that the chewing gum formulations applied typically degrades prior to the chewing of the chewing gum.<br>
It is the object of the invention to obtain a chewing gum in which the degradation of the biodegradable polymer or polymers are minimized prior to the chewing of the chewing gum.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to the invention, it has been realized that even relatively small amounts of water in the chewing gum containing biodegradable polymers affects the degradation of the chewing gumeven before chewing has occurred.<br>
Therefore, a small amount of water or moisture within the chewing gum is highly desired.<br>
Moisture in chewing gum is typically provided by different water containing chewing gum ingredients such as sweeteners. One type of sweetener is carbohydrate syrups, such as conventional corn syrups or sugar alcohol syrups (including sorbitol solutions and hydrogenatcd starch hydroiysate solutions) typically added to chewing gum compositions to improve binding and softness characteristics in the gum.<br><br>
2<br>
A problem of a low moisture chewing gum is however generally, that a lower water content results in a less attractive texture of the chewing gum Therefore, additional softeners typically needs to be added.<br>
This is however a problem, when dealing with biodegradable chewing gum due to the fact that chewing gum made on the basis of biodegradable polymer has turned out to be more vulnerable to softeners than chewing gum made on the basis of     . conventional polymers.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been realized that chewing gum made on the basis of biodegradable polymers, most probably due to the hydrophilic nature of typical biodegradable polymers, exhibits a significantly faster gaining of softness during the initial chew compared to chewing gum made on the basis of conventional hydrophobia polymers.<br>
According to several experiments under different conditions, a chewing gum made on the basis of biodegradable polymers actually having an initial stiffness (the very first chew) greater than conventional chewing gum, actually increases in softness much faster than conventional chewing gum, thereby reaching the initial acceptable texture before the conventional chewing gum. It has moreover been realized that this phenomena is also present when almost no moisture is present in the chewing gum as from the beginning.<br>
Therefore, the "chewing gum comprising at least one biodegradable polymer according to the present invention is not a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregatipn of the properties of the components thereof.<br>
According to the invention, a biodegradable chewing gum having low moisture has been provided. According to the invention, low moisture content has been obtained in combination with an initial acceptable texture.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum contains less than about 2.0 weight percent water of the chewing gum<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum contains from about 0.01 to about 2.0 weight percent water of the chewing gum.<br><br>
3<br>
According to an embodiment of the inventions, degradability tests have revealed that an acceptable chewing gum product having a certain stability with respect to degradation may be obtained when applying for moisture content as high as approximately 1.0 weight percent of water indicating that the water content may be as high as 2.0 weight percent water of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum contains less than 1.0 weight percent water of the chewing gum<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum contains less than 0.75 weight percent water of the chewing gum<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum contains less than 0.2 weight percent water of the chewing gum<br>

Aqueous syrups, such as corn syrup and hydrogenated corn syrup may be used, particularly if their moisture content is reduced. This can preferably be done by coevaporating the aqueous syrup with a plasticizer, such as glycerin or propylene glycol, to a moisture content of less than 10%. Preferred compositions include hydrogenated starch hydrolyzate solids and glycerin. Such syrups and their methods of preparation are discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,967, incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>

Detailed description<br>
In the present context the terms environmentally or biologically degradable polymer compounds refers to chewing gum base components which, after dumping the chewing gum, is capable of undergoing a physical, chemical and/or biological degradation whereby the dumped chewing gum waste becomes more readily<br><br>
13<br>
removable from the site of dumping or is eventually disintegrated to lumps or particles which are no longer recognisable as being chewing gum remnants. The degradation or disintegration of such degradable polymers can be effected or induced by physical factors such as temperature, light, moisture, by chemical factors such as hydrolysis caused by a change in pH or by the action of enzymes capable of degrading the polymers. In other useful embodiments all of the polymer components of the gum base are environmentally degradable or biodegradable polymers.<br>
Preferably, the ultimate degradation products are carbon dioxide, methane and water.<br>
According to a preferred definition of biodegradability according to the invention biodegradability is a property of certain organic molecules whereby, when exposed to the natural environment or placed within a living organism, they react through an enzymatic or microbial process, often in combination with a pure chemical process such as hydrolysis, to form simpler compounds, and ultimately, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and water.<br>
Accordingly, suitable examples of additional environmentally or biologically degradable chewing gum base polymers which can be applied in accordance with the gum base of the present invention include degradable polyesters, polycarbonates, polyester amides, polypeptides, homopolymers of amino acids such as polylysine, and proteins including derivatives hereof such as e.g. protein hydrolysates including a zein hydrolysate. Particularly useful compounds of this type include polyester polymers obtained by the polymerisation of one or more cyclic esters such as lactide, glycolide, trimethylene carbonate, 6-valerolactone, p-propiolactone and e-caprolactone. Such degradable polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers, including block-polymers.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, the term "molecular weight" means number average molecular weight (Mn).<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
14<br>
Preparation of resin<br>
A resin sample was produced using a cylindrical glass, jacketed 10 L pilot reactor equipped with glass stir shaft and Teflon stir blades and bottom outlet. Heating of the reactor contents was accomplished by circulation of silicone oil, thermostated to 130°C, through the outer jacket. D,L-iactide (4.877 kg, 33.84 mol) was charged to the reactor and melted by heating to 140 °C for 6 h. After the D,L-lactide was completely molten, the temperature was reduced to 130 °C, and stannous octoate (1.79 g, 4.42 x 10-3 mol), 1,2-propylene glycol (79.87 g, 1.050 mol), and e-caprolactone (290.76 g, 2.547 mol) were charged to the reactor. After the mixture became homogeneous, stirring was continued for 24 h at 130°C. At the end of this time, the bottom outlet was opened., and molten polymer was allowed to drain into a Teflon-lined paint can.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 5,700 g/mol and Mw = 7,100 g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = 30.7 °C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
15<br>
A LMWE sample was synthesized within a dry N2 glove box, as follows. Into a 500 mL resin kettle equipped with overhead mechanical stirrer, 0.40 g 1,2-propane diol (1.82 mL of a 22.0 % (w/v) solution in MeCl2), and 0.094 g Sn(Oct)2 (2.2 mL of a 4.27 % (w/v) solution of in MeCl2) were charged under dry N2 gas purge. The MeCb was allowed to evaporate under the N2 purge for 15 min. Then e-caprolactone (170 g, 1.49 mol), TMC (76g, 0.74 mol), and 5-valerolactone (74 g, 0.74 mol) were added. The resin kettle was submerged in a 130 °C constant-temperature oil bath and stirred for 14 h. Subsequently the kettle was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 57,960 g/mol and Mw = 85,910 g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = - 59.8°C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of HMWE<br>
A HMWE sample was synthesized in a dry N2 glove box, as follows. Into a 500 mL resin kettle equipped with overhead mechanical stirrer was charged 0.037 g Sn(Oct)2 (2.4 ml of a 1.54% (w/v) solution in methylene chloride) under dry N2 gas purge. The methylene chloride was allowed to evaporate under the N2 purge for 15 min. Then, pentaerythritol (0.068 g, 4.99 x 10'4mol), e-caprolactone (68.0g, 0.596 mol), TMC (7.0 g, 0.069 mol), and 5-valerolactone (33.0 g, 0.33 mol) were added. The resin kettle was then submerged in a 130 °C constant-temperature oil bath and stirred for about 2 - 2.5 h, at which time the mass solidified and could no longer be stirred. The reacting mass was then maintained at 130 °C for an additional 11.5 - 12 h for a total reaction time of 14 h. Subsequently the kettle was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature..<br>

The remaining resin is then added to the kettle and mixed for 10-20 minutes. The<br>
LMWE elastomer is added and mixed for 20-40 minutes until the whole mixture<br>
becomes homogeneous.<br>
The mixture is then discharged into the pan and allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
from the discharged temperature of 60-80 °C, or the gumbase mixture is used<br>
directly for chewing gum by adding all chewing gum components in an appropriate<br>
order under continuous mixing.<br>

The chewing gum products are prepared as follows:<br>
The gum base is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g. horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15 minutes to temperatures of about 60-80 °C. Or the mixing step is continued directly from the gum base preparation i.e. in a one step operation. The mixing process is preformed at a temperatures between 60-80 °C.<br>
One third portion of the sorbitol is added together with the gum base and mixed for 1-2 minutes. Another one third portion of the sorbitol and lycasin are then added to<br><br>
18<br>
the kettle and mixed for 2 minutes. The remaining one third portion of sorbitol, peppermint and menthol are added and mixed for 2 minutes.Then aspartame and acesulfame are added to the kettle and mixed for 3 minutes. Xylitol is added and mixed for 3 minutes. The resulting gum mixture is then discharged and e.g. transferred to a pan at temperature of 40-48 °C. The gum is then rolled and scored into cores, sticks, balls, cubes, and nay other desired shape, optionally followed by coating and polishing processes prior to packaging.<br>
EXAMPLE 6-9<br>
Mint refers to the chewing gum formulation of example 5 with maltitol syrup.<br>
Rheological texture profile of conventional and biodegradable chewing gum containing flavor.<br><br><br>
19<br>
Figure 1 illustrates rheological chewing profiles of the chewing gum corresponding to example 6-9.The gum centres were chewed in a chewing machine (CF Jansson). The chewing frequency was set to 1 Hz, a pH buffer was used as saliva and the temperature was set at 37 °C. The chewing time was set to 15 sec, 30 sec, 60 sec and 120 sec. After chewing, the chewed cud was measured on a rheometer, type AR1000 from TA Instruments in a frequency scan. The results from these measurements can be seen on Fig 1 and 2 wherein the storage modulus (G') and tan(S ) versus chewing time is depicted illustrating the texture changes during chewing.<br>
From figure 1 it can be seen that the biodegradable chewing gums ex. 7-9 are softening faster than the chewing gum ex. 6 being 100% conventional seen as an increased slope jin tan 5 i.e. a faster development of viscous flow. The figure also illustrates that ex. 9 containing 80% of biodegradable polymer is softening faster that the two other chewing gums containing only 40% biodegradable polymer. This figure also states that textures of chewing gum containing biodegradable polymers are comparable to the texture of a conventional chewing gum. In summery, the more biodegradable polymer in the chewing gum the faster it softens.<br>
EXAMPLE 10-11<br>
Rheological texture profile of conventional and biodegradable chewing gum with and without maltitol syrup in the formulation.<br><br><br><br>
20<br>
Mint refers to the chewing gum formulation of example 5.<br>
Figure 2 show the effect on texture when leaving the maltitol syrup out of the formulation as ex. 10 being without maltitol syrup is having a lower tan 8 i.e. a higher stiffness. The texture of ex. 10 approaches ex. 11 fast reaching ex. 10 after approx. 20 seconds of chewing.<br>
In summery, the loss of softness in the initial chew as seen in the chewing gum without maltitol syrup is fast compensated by the fast uptake of saliva in the chewing gum as a result of the hydrophilic nature of the biodegradable polymers used.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Hardness<br>
Table 1: Hardness of biodegradable chewing gum with and without maltitol syrup-<br>
The hardness of the two examples 10 and 11 were measured in order to determine instant hardness i.e. a measure of the chewing resistance in the first few chews in the chewing gums. The hardness of the test samples were tested by an compression load test using a TA-XT2i TEXTURE analyser from Stable Micro Systems with a 4 mm DIA CYLINDER STAINLESS at a speed of 0.4 mm/s using a test distance of 3.5 mm into the chewing gum body. The test result (N) of this experiment is shown in the below Table 1<br><br><br>
21<br>
As can be seen from the above Table 1, the chewing gum samples containing maltitol syrup are softer than the chewing gum without the maltitol syrup in accordance with the result in example 10-11.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Degradation of biodegradable chewing gum with and without maltitol syrup in the formulation.<br>
A panel evaluated the two samples over a period of 4 months every one month. The following rating was used:<br><br>
Rating	Description<br>
1	Very poor<br>
2	Poor<br>
3	Acceptable<br>
4	Good<br>
5	Very good<br>
Table 2: Ratings<br><br>

3 month	4	4	3	3<br>
4 month	4	4	1-2	2<br>
Table 3: Evaluation of degradation<br><br>
22<br>
Experiments by evaluating the texture and the taste as a function of time have shown<br>
that the ex. 10 - without maltitol syrup - has significant improved taste and texture.<br>
Hence, it is thereby indicated that low water content in the chewing gum<br>
formulations improves the biodegradable chewing gum resulting in a prolonged shelf<br>
life.<br>
The degradation rate according to example 11 is regarded as acceptable for certain<br>
