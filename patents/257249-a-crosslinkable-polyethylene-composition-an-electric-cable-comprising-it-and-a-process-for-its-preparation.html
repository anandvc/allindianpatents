A CROSSLINKABLE POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITION, AN ELECTRIC CABLE COMPRISING IT, AND A PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition having a silane content of about 0.1 to 10 % by weight and at least one silanol condensation catalyst. The invention further relates to an insulated electric cable comprising the composition, and a process for the preparation of the composition. Background of the invention<br>
It is known to crosslink different polymers by means of additives. Crosslinking improves such properties of the polymer as its mechanical strength and heat resistance. Polymers normally considered to be thermoplastics, and not crosslinkable, can also be crosslinked by introducing crosslinkable groups in the polymer. An example thereof is the crosslinking of polyolefins, such as polyethylene. A silane compound can be introduced as a crosslinkable group, e.g. by grafting the silane compound onto the prepared polyolefin, or by copolymerisation of the olefin and the silane compound. This technique is previously known, and further details may be obtained from US patent specifications 4 413 066, 4 297 310, 4 351 876, 4 397 981, 4 446 283 and 4 456 704.<br>
The crosslinking of polymers with hydrolysable silane groups is carried out by so-called moisture curing. In a first step, the silane groups are hydrolysed under the influence of water, resulting in the splitting-off of alcohol and the formation of silanol groups. In a second step, the silanol groups are crosslinked by a condensation reaction splitting of water. In both steps, a so-called silanol condensation catalyst is used as a catalyst.<br><br>
Conventional silanol condensation catalysts include carboxylates of metals, such as tin, zinc, iron, lead and cobalt; organic bases; inorganic acids; and organic acids.<br>
As specific examples may be mentioned dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) , dibutyl tin diacetate, dioctyl tin dilaurate, stannous acetate, stannous caprylate, lead naphthenate, zinc caprylate, cobalt naphthenate, ethyl amines, dibutyl amine, hexyl amines, pyridines, inorganic acids, such as sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid, as well as organic acids, such as toluene sulphonic acid, acetic acid, stearic acid and maleic acid. Particularly the tin carboxylates are often used as catalysts.<br>
Crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene compositions are utilized for various purposes and a specific use is as insulation for electric cables. However, prior art crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene compositions exhibit problems with so-called 'frozen layers", i.e. when extruding the polymer on the conductor of the cable the molecules of the polymer composition close to the conductor do not have the possibility to relax when they are brought in contact with the cold conductor and this leads to the formation of a thin layer of highly oriented molecules close to the conductor. This orientation in turn leads to impaired mechanical properties. In particular it is difficult or impossible for the insulation layer to attain a desired tensile strength at break of at least 12.5 MPa and an elongation at break of at least 200 %. Although it is possible to alleviate this problem by preheating the conductor, this requires investment in a preheater which increases the cost. Another solution is to reduce the die pressure by the use of a tube on the die. This solution, however, leads to deterioration of the wetting properties which in turn means reduced adhesion properties between the conductor and the insulation layer.<br><br>
In   view   of   these  disadvantages ' of   the   prior   art   it would  be   an   important  technical   improvement   to   achieve   a crosslinkable   silane   containing  polyethylene   composition which  obtains   the  above mentioned  desired mechanical properties  without  using  measures   such  as   a   preheater   or a  tube  on  the  die. Summary  of  the   invention<br>
It  is   an  object  of  the  present  invention  to eliminate   or  at  least  alleviate  the  above   disadvantages of  the  prior   art  and  obtain   a   Crosslin kable   si lane containing  polyethylene   composition  which   when cros si inked has  a  tensile   strength  at  break  of   at   least 12.5 MPa,   determined  according   to   ISO   527,    and   an elongation   at  break  of   at   least   200  %,   determined according  to   ISO  527,<br>
It   is   a   further  object   to  obtain   such   a   composition which   does   not  need  any  preheating  of   the   cable   conductor or    the  use  of  a  tube  on  the  die  when  extruding   the composition   as  insulation   around  the   conductor   of   an electric  cable.<br>
It  has  been  discovered  at   the  present   invention   that the  above   objects  can be  achieved  by  restricting   the   long chain  branching  of  the  polymer   composition.   More particularly,   the  polymer  composition   should  have   a   long chain  branching  as  defined  by  the  branching  parameter  g' of  at   least   0.65.<br>
It  has   also been discovered  at  the   present   invention that a  crosslinkable  silane  containing polyethylene composition  can be  obtained by  carrying   out  high  pressure polymerisation  at  a peak  temperature  of   at  most   260°C.<br>
Thus,   the present  invention provides   a  crosslinkable silane  containing polyethylene   composition  having  a silane  content  of  about   0.1  to   10   % by  weight,   and  at least  one  silanol  condensation  catalyst,   characterised  in that  the  composition has  a branching  parameter    (g')   value of at  least  0.65.<br><br>
The present invention further provides an insulated electric cable, the insulation of which is derived from a crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition having a silane content of about 0,1 to 10 % by weight, and at least one silanol condensation catalyst, characterised in that the composition has a branching parameter (g') value of at least 0.65.<br>
Further still, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition as defined above, characterised in that the process is a high pressure polymerisation process at a peak temperature of at most 260°C.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear from the appended claims and the following description. Brief description of the drawings<br>
In the attached drawing Figure 1 schematically shows a universal calibration graph;<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a Viscosity Low plot; and Figure 3 schematically shows a combined graph with Viscosity Low plots for linear and branched polymers as well as a graph for gr . Detailed description of the invention<br>
The crosslinkable polymer composition according to the invention generally concerns a crosslinkable ethylene polymer containing hydrolysable silane groups as indicated earlier, and more precisely it relates to olefin copolymers or graft polymers which contain hydrolysable silane groups and which are crosslinked under the influence of water and at least one silanol condensation catalyst. Specifically, the crosslinkable polymer is an ethylene homopolymer or copolymer containing crosslinkable silane groups introduced either by copolymerisation of graft polymerisation.<br><br>
Regarding graft polymerisation reference is made to US 3 646 155 and 4 117 195.<br>
Preferably, the silane-containing polymer is obtained by copolymerisation of ethylene and an unsaturated silane compound. In the following the invention will therefore be described with particular reference to such copolymerisation of ethylene and an unsaturated silane compound.<br>
The unsaturated silane compound is represented by the formula {I)<br>
RiSiR'nYs-n	(I)<br>
wherein<br>
Ri   is   an  ethylenically  unsaturated  hydrocarbyl,<br>
hydrocarbyloxy   or    (meth)acryloxy  hydrocarbyl   group,<br>
R'   is   an  aliphatic   saturated hydrocarbyl  group,<br>
Y  which may be   the   same   or  different,   is   a  hydrolysable<br>
organic  group,   and<br>
n   is   0,   1   or   2.<br>
If there is more than on Y group, these do not have to be<br>
identical.<br>
Specific examples of the unsaturated silane compound are those wherein Ri is vinyl, allyl, isopropenyl, butenyl, cyclohexenyl, or gamma-(meth)acryloxy propyl; Y is methoxy, ethoxy, formyloxy, acetoxy, propionyloxy or an alkyl- or arylamino group; and R' , if present, is a methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl or phenyl group.<br>
A preferred unsaturated silane compound is represented by the formula (II)<br>
CH2=CHSi(OA)3	(II)<br>
wherein A is a hydrocarbyl group having 1-8 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The most preferred compounds are vinyl trimethoxy-silane, vinyl bismethoxyethoxysilane, vinyl triethoxy-silane, gamma-trimethoxysilane, gamma- (meth)acryloxy-triethoxysilane, gamma-(meth)acryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane, gamma- (meth) acryloxypropyltriethoxysilane, and vinyl triacetoxysilane.<br><br>
The copolymerisation of the ethylene and the unsaturated silane compound is carried out under suitable conditions resulting in the copolymerisation of the two monomers. However, the polymerisation should be carried out under conditions such that the resulting polymer composition has a branching parameter (g' ) value of at least 0.65.<br>
The polymer composition according to the invention is preferably a low density polymer made by a high pressure polymerisation process. In addition to the silane component the polymer may contain other comonomers such as alpha-olefine comonomers and a cry late comonomers. Particularly preferred are hydroxy-containing comonomers such as 2-hydroxy ethylmethacrylate (HEMA) , which improve the adhesion of the polymer.<br>
The branching parameter, gr , is a measure of the amount of long chain branches (LCB) . A branching parameter value of g' =1 means that the polymer composition contains no long chain branches, whereas a branching parameter value of g' 
By the expression "long chain branch" or "LCB" used herein is meant a branch on the polymer backbone having at least 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The branching parameter g' is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and calculation from the equation:<br>
gr    =    [Hi branched/ [I")] linear/<br>
where   [rebranched is  the intrinsic viscosity of  the  branched polymer  in  question  and   [nl linear  is   the  intrinsic viscosity of  an  linear   (unbranched)   standard polymer.<br><br>
The procedure for determining the branching parameter g' will be described more extensively below in connection with the examples.<br>
At the present invention it has been discovered that when preparing a crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition by high pressure copolymer! sat ion the required g' value of at least 0.65 is obtained by controlling the polymerisation temperature. More particularly, the maximum temperature or peak temperature in the polymerisation reactor should be at most 260°C. A peak temperature above 260°C gives too much long chain branching and a g' value below 0. 65. Preferably, the peak polymerisation temperature lies in the range 250-260°C. The polymerisation temperature should not be below 180°C as the polymerisation reaction then ceases or proceeds at a very low rate.<br>
As mentioned above the g' value at the present invention is at least 0.65. The theoretical upper limit of the g' value is g' = 1 (no long chain branches), but this value is very difficult, if not impossible to achieve in practice, because if the polymerisation temperature is lowered too much the polymerisation reaction becomes very slow or ceases. In practice the g' value mostly lies in the range from 0.65 to 0.85.<br>
The pressure of the polymerisation reaction does not seem to have any significant effect on the g' value of the polymer composition. Generally, the pressure of the polymerisation reaction is at least 120 MPa, preferably 230-260 MPa or higher.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition of the invention has a silane content of about 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on the composition. Preferably the silane compound constitutes 0.1 to 5 % by weight, and more preferably 0.1 to 3 % by weight, based on the composition.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition of the invention<br><br>
comprises at least one silanol condensation catalyst, The silanol condensation catalyst may be any one   of the conventional silanol condensation catalysts described earlier herein/ or a mixture thereof. Preferably, however, the silanol condensation catalyst is a sulphonic acid such as a compound of the general formula (III)<br>
ArS03H	(III)<br>
or a hydrolysable precursor thereof, Ar being a substituted aryl group, and the compound containing 14-28 carbon atoms in total. Preferably, Ar is an alkyl-substituted benzene or naphthalene ring with the alkyl substituent containing 8-20 carbon atoms in the benzene case and 4-18 carbon atoms in the naphthalene case. Preferably the catalyst of formula (III) is dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid or tetrapropyl benzene sulphonic acid. For more details regarding the catalyst of formula (III) reference is made to WO 95/17463.<br>
The amount of silanol condensation catalyst present in the crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition generally is in the order of about 0.0001-3 % by weight, preferably about 0.001-2 % by weight, and most preferably about 0.005-1 % by weight, based on the amount of silanol-group containing polymers in the composition.<br>
As is usually the case for polymer compositions, the crosslinkable silane containing polyethylene composition may contain various additives, such as antioxidants, stabilisers, lubricants, fillers, and colouring agents.<br>
Having thus described the present invention it will now be further illustrated by way of some non-limiting examples and comparative examples.<br>
The following procedure was used in the examples to determine g!. This procedure should be followed when determining the branching parameter g1 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography is used for determination of molecular weight (M), molecular<br><br>
distribution   (Mw/Mn) ,   intrinsic   viscosity    [r|]   and contents   of  long   chain  branching    (LCB/g') .<br>
Gel   Permeation   Chromatography    (GPC) ,    which   is   also known   as   Size  Exclusion   Chromatography    (SEC),is   an analytical  technique  where   the molecules   are  separated after  their  size.   Large  molecules   elutes   first  and   the smaller   ones  later.<br>
Molecules   elute  after  decreasing  hydrodynamic   volume Vh.   This   can be   described  as  a  product   of   the molecules molecular  weight   (M)   and  its   intrinsic  viscosity   [t|] .<br>
The  principe   of  universal  calibration   in  GPC   states that   for   given   sets   of   solvent   and  temperature   conditions in  which   a polymer   sample  is   separated  by  pure   size mechanism   (no  adsorption  or  other  effects),   the   logarithm of  the  hydrodynamic  volume  of  a  polymer   molecule   as   a function  of  its   elution  volume   (or   time)    is  identical   for all   polymers,   linear   or  branched.   See   the   equation:<br>
Vh =   [TJXM   or   logVh =  log([r)]xM)<br>
The  hydrodynamic  volume  is   defined   as   a  product   of intrinsic viscosity   [r\]   and molecular  weight  M.<br>
Universal   calibration   is  independent   of  the  polymer type   and  possible  branched polymers.<br>
A  serial  of   small   standard  is   used   to   find  the relation  between   retention  time   and molecular  weight.   A plot   of   log Vh  against   retention  time   gives   a  universal calibration graph  as   schematically  shown   in  Figure   1.<br>
Mark-Houwink-Sakurade  equation   relates  a  polymer intrinsic viscosity  to  its  viscosity  average molecular weight Mv<br>
[r|]   = K x  Mav<br>
[r\]   is the-intrinsic viscosity.<br>
Mv is the viscosity average molecular weight.<br>
K and a are Mark-Houwink constants. These constants are dependent of the polymer type, solution and the temperature.<br>
By taking the logarithm on both sides of the equation we will get:<br><br>
log[r)]   =   logK   +   a   x   logMv<br>
A plot of log [rj] verses log [Mv] (narrow standards) gives slope and the intercept K. This is the Viscosity-Low   plot   as   schematically   shown   in   Figure  2.<br>
If  K and  a   are   known   for  both   standards   and  samples, the  molecular  weights   can  be  decided by mean  of   the relation to  their   respective  constants.<br>
GPC uses a Universal Calibration for quantitative evaluation  of   the  molecular  weight   distribution.<br>
The  calibration   is   based  on  narrow  standards   to calculate  a  universal   calibration   curve.   The  retention time   for  each   standard   (the  RI   peak)   is   calculated.   These values,   together   with  the   appurtenant  molecular   weight are   used  to make   a   universal   calibration  curve.<br>
The  software   is   able  to produce   a  plot   of   Log Viscosity versus   Log  Molecular  Weight   for both   the  RI-and   the  viscosity-detector.   Each   detector produces   a universal   calibration   for  each   fraction  within   the polymer  chromatogram.<br>
A  universal   calibration  gives   genuine molecular weight   results.<br>
The  software   can  decide  K  and  a   for  the   standards.<br>
The  following   values   are   recommended to  be   used.<br>
PS:      K  -   9,54*10"5	a   =   0,725<br>
PE:      K =  3, 92*10"4	a   =   0,725<br>
The  equipment   used was  a  Waters   150CVplus   Gel Permeation Chromatograph no.   W-4412   (cf.  Waters   150CVplus Viscometer   Supplement) having   a   differential  Refractive Index   (dRI)   detector  and a  single  capillary viscometer detector,   and  three  HT6E  Styragel   (porous  styrene-divinylbenzene)   columns   from Waters .   Calibration  was  made with  narrow molecular  weight  distribution polystyrene standards with   different molecular  weights   (alll6_05002). The mobile  phase  was   1,2,4-trichlorobenzene   (purity   98.5 %)   with  0.25   g/1  BHT,   2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol  added as   an  antioxidant.   Millennium32  Version  4  software  from Waters  was  used  for  calculation  of   g1    (LCB) .<br><br>
Viscosity Low Plots are determined for the polystyrene standards which have no long chain branching and therefore represent linear (unbranched) polymers, and for the branched polyethylene composition of the invention. The branching parameter is thereafter calculated from the equation:<br>
g'     =     [n] branched/ [ F| ] linear/<br>
where [n] branched is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer in question and [n] linear is the intrinsic viscosity of an linear (unbranched) standard polymer.<br>
The above is illustrated in Figure 3 which shows a combined graph with Viscosity Low Plots for linear,, and branched polymers as well as a graph for g1.<br>
In the examples the mechanical properties were tested on cable samples. The tested cable samples were manufactured in the following way: Cables consisting of an 8 mm2 compact aluminium conductor and an insulation thickness of 0.7 mm were produced in a Nokia-Mailefer 60 mm extruder at a line speed of 75 m/min.<br>
Die: Pressure (wire guide 3.1 mm, die 4.4 mm) .<br>
Conductor temperature: 20°C (non-preheated conductor) .<br>
Cooling bath temperature: 23°C .<br>
Screws:Elise.<br>
Temperature profile:170-18 0-190-190-190-190-190-190°C.<br>
5% of a silanol condensation catalyst master batch (CMB-1) was dry blended into the polymers prior to extrusion. CMB-1 consists of 1.7% dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid crosslinking catalyst, drying agent (HDTMS, hexadodecyl trimethoxysilane) and antioxidant (butylated reaction product of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene) mixed into an ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer. Butyl acrylate content: 17 % by weight, MFR2.16 = 4.5 g/10 min.<br><br>
