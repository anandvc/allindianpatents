Method and sheet metal pack for manufacturing a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels<br>
The subject-matter of the invention relates to a method and to a sheet metal pack for manufacturing a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels.<br>
Metallic honeycomb bodies are known which are used as catalytic converter supporting bodies. Such a honeycomb body is composed of a large number of at least partly structured sheet metal layers. Numerous examples of the configuration of a honeycomb body are known from, for example, US-PS 4,923,109, WO 90/03220, EP 0 322 566 Al and WO 94/01661.<br>
WO 97/00725 deals with the manufacturing of a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels made from a large number of at least partly structured layers. This document proposes that at least one stack of a plurality of at least partly structured sheet metal layers is layered up. Each stack is folded over on itself about a bending line in order to construct a sheet metal pack. Each sheet metal pack is arranged in a mould which has a contour corresponding to the external shape of the honeycomb body to be manufactured. Each stack is held by a looping means arranged in the central area of the mould. All the stacks are subsequently looped into a honeycomb body by rotation of the looping means relative to the mould. The honeycomb body prepared in this manner is subsequently fitted into a jacket tube. A further method for manufacturing a honeycomb body is known from WO 97/00135.<br>
In further manufacturing steps, the honeycomb body is brazed to the jacket tube. With this, it is substantially the end areas of the individual sheet metal layers which are brazed to the jacket tube. With honeycomb bodies manufactured in this way, there is the danger that by folding each stack over on itself and looping the stack<br><br>
2<br>
into a honeycomb body, in the area where the individual sheet metal layers join the jacket tube, some sheet metal layers are brazed to the jacket pipe over a relatively large part of the periphery of the jacket surface of the jacket pipe, while other sheet metal layers are only brazed to the jacket tube over a relatively small section of the periphery. This type of joining of the honeycomb body to the jacket pipe carries the danger that the honeycomb body will be damaged because of its mechanical and thermal stressing. In particular, there is the danger that the brazed connection between individual sheet metal layers will be at least partially destroyed.<br>
Proceeding from this, the object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a honeycomb body which makes more even forming of a brazed connection to the jacket pipe possible. A further object of the invention is to provide a particularly suitable sheet metal pack for forming a honeycomb body.<br>
This object is solved by means of a method for manufacturing a honeycomb body<br>
with the features of claim 1, and respectively by means of a sheet metal pack with<br>
    the features of claim 8. Advantageous further developments and configurations of<br>
   The method and respectively of the sheet metal pack according to the invention are<br>
the subject-matter of the respective dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with the method according to the invention for manufacturing a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels, it is proposed that at least one stack is formed from a plurality of at least partly structured sheet metal layers, which are layered up. Afterwards, each stack is folded over on itself about a bending line to form a sheet metal pack such that the sheet metal pack has a curved first end area and a second end area opposite the first end area. The folding over of the stack on itself to form the sheet metal pack is done such that the second end area is formed by a first end section and a second end section of the stack. The first end section has a first end face. The second end section has a second end face. The first end face and the second end face together form an end face of the second end area of the sheet metal pack.   The end faces are inclined<br><br>
3<br>
relatively towards one another. The first end face forms a first angle ? with a central plane, which is formed for example by means of a central sheet metal layer of the sheet metal pack which is folded over on itself. The second end face forms a second angle ? with the central plane. The angle ? and the angle ? are inclusive angles. The angles are selected such that the first angle ? is smaller than the second angle ?. This is obtained in that during folding the sheet metal layers in the first end section are displaced substantially more greatly relative to one another than the sheet metal layers in the second end section. In principle, the second end area of the stack of sheet metal is configured asymmetrically.<br>
Each sheet metal pack is then held by a looping means arranged in the central area of a mould and looped into a honeycomb body by rotation of the looping means relative to the mould.<br>
Unexpectedly, it has been shown that by means of the implementation of the method according to the invention when forming the honeycomb body, said honeycomb body has relatively evenly distributed sheet metal layer end parts, viewed in the direction of the periphery, so considerably more even brazing of the honeycomb body to the jacket pipe is possible. Because the honeycomb body can be more evenly brazed, a greater degree of operational reliability of the honeycomb body can be obtained.<br>
According to an advantageous further development of the method, it is proposed that during folding of the stack a considerably greater relative displacement of the sheet metal layers is permitted in the first end section than in the second end section. It is proposed in particular that during the folding, the sheet metal layers of the stack of the second end section are substantially stationary. In this way, the second end section of the sheet metal pack substantially retains the original shape of the end section as the stack. Different sheet metal stacks can also be provided with differently configured end sections, according to the number of stacks of sheet metal which are used for forming a honeycomb body, and according to the shape of the<br><br>
4<br>
honeycomb body to be provided. By combination of different sheet metal packs and by appropriate formation of the second end sections during the folding of a stack, the operational reliability of a honeycomb body can be increased.<br>
To simplify the manufacturing of a honeycomb body, it is also proposed that at least during the folding, the stack is held in at least one area between the second end section and the bending line. This can be done, for example, by clamping the stack by the second end section. The clamping can also be such that it allows a certain displacement of the sheet metal layers.<br>
Preferably, a stack is formed in that the sheet metal layers are layered up such that the second end face of the stack of the second end section is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the stack. In particular, three stacks of this type are used for forming a honeycomb body.<br>
According to a further preferred configuration it is proposed that at least one stack is layered up from at least partly structured sheet metal layers, and the sheet metal layers are substantially completely overlapping.<br>
According to a further advantageous implementation of the method it is proposed that at least two sheet metal packs are arranged in a mould. The curved end area of each of the sheet metal packs is arranged in a central area of the mould. Each sheet metal pack is directed radially outwards as is known, for example, from WO 97/00725. The sheet metal packs are held by the looping means. The sheet metal packs are arranged in the mould such that when viewed in a peripheral direction, a first end section alternates with a second end section. This arrangement of the sheet metal packs in the mould has the advantages that bending of each of the sheet metal packs takes place in the same direction. In this way, a more even distribution of the ends of each of the sheet metal layers of a sheet metal pack is also obtained when viewed in the peripheral direction, with each sheet metal pack.<br><br>
According to yet another advantageous implementation of the method, it is proposed that the direction of rotation of the looping means is selected so that each sheet metal pack is bent around a respective axis of bending which is substantially parallel to the bending line and adjacent to a section of an outer sheet metal layer lying between the second end section and the curved end area.<br>
According to a further inventive concept, a sheet metal pack is proposed for manufacturing a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels. The sheet metal pack is composed of a plurality of at least partly structured sheet metal layers which are layered up and are folded over on themselves about a common bending line. The sheet metal pack has a curved first end area and a second end area opposite the first end area. The second end area is formed by a first end section and a second end section. The sheet metal pack is distinguished in that the first end section has a first end face and the second end section has a second end face, wherein the first end face encloses a first angle ? with a central plane, and the second end face encloses a second angle ? with the central plane, wherein the first angle ? is smaller than the second angle ?. A sheet metal pack thus formed is suitable in particular for manufacturing a honeycomb body. The sheet metal pack can be looped according to the implementation of the method known from WO 97/00725 or from WO 97/00135 with other sheet metal packs of suitable configuration to form a honeycomb body, wherein a honeycomb body is obtained which has sheet metal ends which are distributed particularly evenly in the peripheral direction, so that a relatively even brazed connection between the honeycomb body and a jacket tube can be produced. Preferably, the sheet metal pack is configured such that the second angle ? is approximately 90°.<br>
Further details and advantageous of the method according to the invention and of a sheet metal pack according to the invention, will be explained with reference to the embodiment shown in the/drawings. In these is shown, in:<br>

Figure 1 shows schematically, and in a perspective representation, a stack 27. The stack 27 includes a large number of at least partly structured sheet metal layers 28, 29. The stack in the representation according to Figure 1 is formed from both flat sheet metal layers 28 and corrugated sheet metal layers 29. The flat sheet metal layers 28 and the corrugated sheet metal layers 29 are alternating. The flat sheet metal layers 28 and the corrugated sheet metal layers 29 completely overlap in the embodiment shown. They are layered one above another such that they form a prism with a rectangular base. A bending line 21 is shown in Figure 1 by the broken line, about which the stack 27 is folded over on itself. The bending line 21 is substantially in the centre of the stack 27.<br>
By folding the stack 27 over on itself and about the bending line 21, a sheet metal pack 1 is manufactured as is shown in Figure 2 in an exemplary manner. The sheet metal pack 1 has a first end area 30. The end area 30 which is adjacent to the bending line 21 is curved. The sheet metal pack 1 has a second end area 31. The second end area 31 is opposite the first end area 30. The second end area 31 is formed by a first end section 32 and a second end section 33 of the stack 27.<br>
The first end section 32 has a first end face 35. The end face 35 is inclined towards the first end area 30 opposite. The end face 35 forms a first angle ? with a central plane 34. The second end section 33 has a second end face 36. The end face 36 forms a second angle ? with the central plane 34. As is visible from Figure 2, the first angle ? is smaller, in particular substantially smaller, than the second angle ?.<br><br>
7 In the embodiment shown, the second angle ? is approximately 90°.<br>
Figure 3 shows the arrangement of three sheet metal packs 1, 2, 3 in a mould 5 in a plan view. Each sheet metal pack 1, 2, 3 is arranged with its respective curved first end area 30 in a central area 7 of the mould 5. The sheet metal packs 1, 2, 3 extend radially outwards from the central area 7. The sheet metal packs 1, 2, 3 are arranged such that seen in a peripheral direction, a first end section 32 alternates with a second end section 33.<br>
The mould includes a wall 11, the three rectangular passages 8, 9, 10 of which are distributed equidistantly about the periphery in the embodiment shown. The mould can be connected by means of connecting means which are not shown by an outside flange 13 to a base plate 14, as is shown in Figure 8. The base plate 14 is provided with a passage aperture 15, through which a die 16 which is arranged on an actuating rod 17 can be guided. The cross-section of the aperture 15 and of the die 16 corresponds to the light cross-section of the mould 5. The passages 8, 9 and 10 have longitudinal surfaces 11 which are preferably configured convexly in cross-section, as shown in Figure 7. Preferably, the longitudinal surfaces 11, 12 are provided with a sliding layer 18, 19 which is a sliding layer of ceramic material.<br>
For better clarity, in one representation of the looping means which can twist the sheet metal packs 1, 2, 3 about an axis 4 perpendicular to the plane of the drawing, is not shown. The winding means has winding spindles 24, 25, 26 which engage with each of the sheet metal packs 1, 2 and 3 and rotate in the direction of rotation S of the looping means, The winding spindles 24, 25, 26 engage with an area of the sheet metal pack 1, 2, 3 concerned, which is in the area of the bending line 21, 22, 23.<br>
By twisting the winding spindles 24, 25, 26 about the central axis 4 in the direction S the individual sheet metal packs 1, 2 and 3 are looped in the same direction. During the winding procedure; the sheet metal packs 1,2, and 3 slide along the<br><br>
8<br>
sliding layers 18, 19 of each of the passages 8, 9, 10 into the interior of the mould. The individual sheet metal packs are curved about bending axes 37, 38, 39. The respective bending axes 37, 38, 39 are substantially parallel to the bending line 21, 22, 23 and respectively to the winding spindle 24, 25, 26. It is adjacent to a section 40 of an outside sheet metal layer 44 of each of the sheet metal packs 1,2,3 lying between the second end section 33 and the curved end area 30. During the looping procedure, displacement of the bending axes 37, 38, 39 takes place. The position of the bending axes 37, 38, 39 is dependent upon the looped periphery of the sheet metal packs 1, 2, 3.<br>
During the looping procedure a displacement of the sheet metal layers 28, 29 also takes place so that the second end area 31 substantially matches the internal shape of the mould 5. The displacement of the individual sheet metal layers 28, 29 is therefore such that an even distribution of the ends of the respective sheet metal layers 28, 29 occurs on the periphery of the honeycomb body 6.<br>
The presently described device, by means of which the method for manufacturing a honeycomb body with a large number of fluid permeable channels is explained, represent a preferred embodiment. Alternatively, the method can also be carried out by means of the device described in WO 97/00135 and the method described therein. The content of said WO 97/00135 and of DE 195 21 685.7 is adopted in its entirety.<br><br>
