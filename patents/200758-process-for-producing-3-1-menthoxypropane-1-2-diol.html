				<td>This invention relates to a method for producing 3-4-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol useful as^ e.g., a cool-feeling agent or refreshment improving agent, and l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-
In addition, according to the invention, (2S)-3-l-raenthoxypropane-l,2-diol in which configuration of the 2-position of the propane moiety is controlled and which has more excellent refreshing feeling can be obtained with high optical purity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVEHTION<br>
3-
 <br>
influence on the aroma added to the product and can add cool-feeling action to the product. Accordingly^ making use of these characteristics of 3-f-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol, it has been proposed to add 3- , a.s  well  as  aerosol compositions for anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic use (JP-A-63-264522).<br>
Conventionally known methods for producing 3-4-menthoxypropane-l,2-diol include (i) a method in which i-menthol is made into soditun salt with metallic sodium or sodium hydride and then reacted with an allyl halide to produce 3-^-menthoxypropane-l-ene which is subsequently converted into an oxide by oxidizing it using an organic peroxide and then hydrolyzed <jp-b-61-48813 and a method in which is added to benzyl glycidyl ether the presence of lewis acid produce l-benzyloxy-3- then subjected hydrogenolysis palladium-carbon catalyst eliminate group></jp-b-61-48813>
However, in the conventional method (i), sodium salt of I-menthol is prepared using metallic sodium or sodium hydride, it has a problem of causing a danger of explosion<br><br>
and generation of hydrogen gas. What is more, since oxidation of 3-f-menthoxypropane-1-ene as the intermediate is carried out using an organic peroxide, it has a danger of causing explosion also from this point, so that this cannot be said as an industrially advantageous method, and there is room for further improvement from the economic point of view.<br>
Also, since the conventional method (ii) is a production method aimed at synthesizing optically active substances, it is necessary to use expensive benzyl glycidyl ether. What is more, since the finally obtained 3~
Also, in addition to these conventional methods, (iii) it has been proposed a method in which l,2-epoxy-3-f-menthoxypropane as a synthetic intermediate of 3-1-inenthoxypropane-l,2-diol is synthesized by allowing t-menthol to undergo addition reaction with a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane such as epichlorohydrin in an aqueous solution in the presence of a base and a quaternary ammonium salt [French Patent 2,479,822 (1981)].  However, it is known that a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropan© such as<br><br>
epichlorohydrin is unstable and apt to be decomposed in the presence of an acid or base ["Dictionary of Chemistry" p. 292, published by Tokyo Kagaku Oojin (1989)]. Thus, in the case of this method in which a l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane is allowed to undergo the reaction in the presence of a base, the l,2-epoxy-3~halogenopropane is decomposed when the reaction is carried out for a prolonged period of time, so that it is difficult to synthesize l,2-epoxy-3-
In addition, (iv) a method in which l-allyloxy-3-chloro-2-propanol as an optically active glycerol derivative is produced by allowing epichlorohydrin and allyl alcohol to undergo the reaction in the presence of an acidic catalyst has been proposed as the reaction of epichlorohydrin with an alcohol (JP-A-2-221).  However, this conventional method (iv) uses only primary allyl alcohol as the alcohol to be used in the reaction, and it does not report on the application to secondary alcohols, much less on the addition reaction with menthol.<br>
Also, as another conventional method, it has been proposed (v) a method in which epichlorohydrin and alcohols are allowed to undergo the reaction in the presence of an acid catalyst and then subjected to an alkali treatment to effect ring closure, thereby converting into a glycidyl ether which is subsequently hydrolyzed, and then a glycerol<br><br>
ether is produced by heating the reaction mixture at a temperature of from 100 to 230°C in the presence of a salt formed from a strongly basic compound and a weakly acidic compound (JP-A-2000-212114) . However, in the case of this method, it is necessary to heat the reaction mixture at a high temperature of from 100 to 230°C, particularly from 150 to 200°C, in the presence of a salt formed from a strongly basic compound and a weakly acidic compound, in order to decompose the organic halogen contained in the hydrolysa,te of the glycidyX ether, so that this is not an efficient method. What is more, the alcohols used in this method are primary alcohols represented by a general formula: R-(OA)p-OH (wherein R represents a saturated or unsaturated, straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 36 carbon atoms, A represents an alkylene group having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and p is a number of from 0 to 100), and there is no disclosure on the use of secondary alcohols, much less on the use of menthol.<br>

In order to achieve these objects, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies. As a result, they succeeded in producing a l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-l-menthoxypropanes as novel compounds, by producing a 1-halogeno-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol through the addition reaction of {-menthol with a 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane in an organic solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid, and allowing the thus obtained l-halogeno-3-{-menthoxypropan-2-ol to react with an aliphatic carboxylic acid alkali metal salt. After further studies, it was found that these novel l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-
Thereafter, the inventors have found that (2S)-3-
 <br>
position of the propane moiety is controJJed and which has more exceJJent refreshing feeling can be produced with a high optical purity, by the use of an optically active substance as the l-halogeno-3-l-menthoxypropan-2-ol, and have accomplished the invention based on these findings.<br><br><br><br><br>

Among them, l,2-epoxy-3-chloropropane (epichlorohydrin) or l,2-epoxy-3-bromopropane (epibromohydrin) in which the halogen atom X is chlorine atom or bromine atom is suitably used in the invention, and<br><br>

Regarding the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) and i-menthol as the material compounds, commercial products can be used as such.<br>
In carrying out the reaction to add I-menthol to the 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane {I), a method in which a Lewis acid is added to and dissolved in a solution prepared by dissolving j-menthol in an organic solvent, and then a solution prepared by dissolving the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) in an organic solvent is added dropwise thereto to effect the reaction.<br>

(I).<br>
Also, amount of the Lewis acid to be used may be similar to the catalytically effective amount in the usual addition reaction and, generally, is preferably from sJaout 0.01 to 0.1 mol, based on 1 mol of the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I).<br>

Amount of the organic acid to be used is, in general, preferably from about 0.5 to 5 parts by volume, more preferably from about 1 to 3 parts by volume, based on 1 part by volume of t-menthol.<br>
It is desirable to carry out the addition reaction of C-menthol to the 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or argon gas for effecting smooth progress of the addition reaction.<br>
Also, in carrying out the addition reaction by adding an organic solvent solution of the l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I) dropwise to an organic solvent solution of {-menthol and a Lewis acid, the period of time for the<br><br>
dropwise addition of the 1,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I)-dissolved organic solvent solution is generally preferably from about 0.5 to 10 hours, more preferably from about 1.5 to 3 hours.<br>

In the above reaction, configuration of the 2-position of the propane structure can be controlled without racemization by the use of an optically active l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I).  Illustratively, by the use of a (2R)-l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane {I"), it can be easily introduced into a (2S)-l-halogeno-3-*-inenthoxypropan-2-ol (II"). Also, when a (2S)-l,2-epoxy-3-halogenopropane (I") is used, it can be easily introduced into a (2R)-1-halogeno-3-t-menthoxypropan-2-ol {II").<br>

Among them, one or two or more of sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate and potassium acetate are preferably used, and soditun acetate is used more preferably, from the viewpoint of easy handling and economically low price.<br>
When an alkali metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 6 or more carbon atoms or an aromatic carboxylic acid alkali metal salt is used, solid precipitation becomes considerable so that the l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-f-menthoxypropane (III) cannot be produced smoothly.<br>
From the economical point of view, amount of the used alkali metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms is from about 1.0 to 5.0 mol, particularly from about 1.05 to 2.0 mol, based on 1 mol of the l-halogeno-3-f-menthoxypropan-2-ol (II).<br>
It is desirable that the used alkali metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms is in an anhydrous state, because the l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-{-menthoxypropane (III) can be formed with a high yield and the yield becomes stable.<br><br>

A commercially available phase transfer catalyst can be used as such.<br>
Production reaction of the l-acyloxy-2-siibstituted-3-f-menthoxypropane (III) may be carried out in the absence of solvent or using a solvent.<br>
When a solvent is used, any solvent which does not significantly inhibit the production reaction of 1-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-l-menthoxypropane (III) can be used, but an organic solvent is suitably used.  Illustrative examples of the suitably used organic solvent include aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane and octane; alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents such as cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene and xylene; ether solvents such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and 1,3-dioxofuran; amide solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl ace tamide and N-methylpyrrolidotie; and petroleum ether solvents, which may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more. Among them, dimethylformamide is preferably used from the viewpoint of smooth progress of the reaction, good handling and economically low price.<br><br>

Forming ratio of the (III-A) and (III-B) in l-acyloxy-2-substituted-3-{-roenthoxypropane (III) changes depending on the kind and amount of the alkali metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and the presence or absence, kind and amount of the other components which are used as occasion d^aands (e.g., an aliphatic carboxylic acid anhydride and a phase transfer catalyst) . When the reaction is carried out using only an alkali metal salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms without using an aliphatic carboxylic acid anhydride and a phase transfer catalyst, ration of the l-acyloxy-3-t-menthoxypropan-2-ol (III-A) generally becomes 80% or more.  On the other hand, when an aliphatic carboxylic acid anhydride is jointly used, ratio of the l,2-diacyloxy-3-£-menthoxyprcpane (III-BJ increases as the amount of the aliphatic carboxylic acid anhydride increases.<br>
