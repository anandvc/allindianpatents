				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>This invention is based on strong antioxidants which are useful for all age group. The basic composition of ingredients are-EPA 150 mg, DHA 100 mg, Folic Acid 5 mg and Lycopene 50 mg. DHA is a major fatty acid in sperm and brain phospholipids, particularly in the retina. Dietary DHA may reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing the level of blood triglycerides in humans. Low levels of DHA have been associated with Alzheimer&quot;s disease. Vitamin B9 (folic acid and folate inclusive) is essential to numerous bodily functions ranging from nucleotide biosynthesis to the remethylation of homocysteine. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in biological reactions involving folate. It is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and growth. Both children and adults require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia. Folate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word folium (which means &quot;leaf&quot;). Leafy vegetables are a principal source, although in Western diets fortified cereals and bread may be a larger dietary source. EPA has inhibitory effect on CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 hepatic enzymes. At high dose, it may also inhibit the activity of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, important enzymes involved in drug metabolism. EPA improves the response of patients to chemotherapy, possibly by modulating the production of eicosanoid. It might also reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer; including multiple myeloma.Lycopene helps neutralize harmful free radicals, which are implicated in cancer, heart disease, macular degeneration and other age-related illnesses. The evidence for a benefit was strongest for cancers of the prostate, lung, and stomach. Data were also suggestive of a benefit for cancers of the pancreas, colon and rectum, esophagus, oral cavity, breast, and cervix.</td>

India<br>
PREAMBLE OF INVENTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be perform<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION: This invention is based on active antioxidants which are useful for all age group like adult, kids thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
In the existing system as given in IPC8 Class: AA61K4706FI and USPC Class: 424 944twherein A method of providing controlled release of a biologically active substance within a subject's digestive system. The biologically active substance is administered concurrently with one or more soluble fibers in an oral dosage unit. The soluble fibers interact with the biologically active substance within the subject's digestive system to moderate and control the release of the biologically active substances in the subject's bloodstream. This provides more constant blood concentrations of the biologically active substances. The amount of soluble fibers in the oral dosage unit is greater than 40% by weight, and in some case:s greater than 50% by weight of the oral dosage unit. The oral dosage unit typically contains from about 1 to 15g of soluble fiber, and in some cases from about 3 to 5g of soluble fiber. The biologically active substance may contain phytonutrients that promote the subject's cardiovascular system, immune system, or weight manage'ment-<br>
In the existing system as given in United States Patent 6649195 wherein A powerful formulation for preventing and treating macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and other eye discases- and contains over thirty naturally effective vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and amino acids, which have all been found to demonstrate a powerful protective effect on the health of the eye.<br>
In the existing system as given in WO/2009/053824 wherein The preset invention concerns a new composition based on pellets of lipoic acid in a lipophilic medium, if necessary confined with other active ingredients.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION: The main object of the invention is to provide an active antioxidant for the all age group. Prior antioxidants targeted on the particular age group. This is one of the strong antioxidant as comparative to others. Deficiency of antioxidants or low level of the same can cause oxidative stress and hence eventually kill cells. For all this reasons antioxidants are so important for the body metabolism and it also helps in lowering down the cell aging.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION: This invention is based on active antioxidants which are useful for all age group like adult, kids thereof. These are active antioxidants. They work on whole body as well as its metabolism. <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF THE INVENTION: This invention is based on the strong antioxidants which are essential for all age group,<br>
ANTIOXIDANT= An antioxidant is a molecule capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons from a substance to an oxidizing agent. Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which start chain reactions that damage cells. Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions by being oxidized themselves. As a result, antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols, ascorbic acid or polyphenols. Antioxidants are also widely used as ingredients in dietary supplements in the hope of maintaining health and preventing diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease. Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large clinical trials did not detect any benefit and suggested instead that excess supplementation may be harmful. In addition to the uses of natural antioxidants in medicine, oxidation reactions are crucial for life, they can also be damaging; hence, plants and animals maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E as well as enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and various peroxidases.	t<br>
KPA 150 mg DHA 100 mg Folic Acid 5 mg Lycopene 50 mg<br>
EPA- Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or also icosapentaenoic acid) is an omega-3 fatty acid. EPA and its metabolites act in the body largely by their interactions with the metabolites of arachidonic acid; It is obtained in the human diet by eating oily fish or fish oil—cod liver, herring, mackerel, salmon, menhaden and sardine. It is also found in human milk, its beneficial potential in mental conditions, such as schizophrenia.. EPA may affect depression, and importantly, suicidal behavior. EPA has inhibitory effect on CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 hepatic enzymes. At high dose, it may also inhibit the activity of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, important enzymes involved in drug metabolism. EPA improves the response of patients to chemotherapy,..possibly by modulating the production of eicosanoid. It might also reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including multiple myeloma.<br>
DHA=Docosahexaenoic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid. DHA is metabolized to form the docosanoids, which comprise several families of potent hormones. DHA is a major fatty acid in sperm and brain phospholipids, particularly in the retina. Dietary DHA may reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing the level of blood triglycerides in humans. Low levels of DHA have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Folic acid= Folic acid (also known as vitamin B9 or folacin) and folate (the naturally occurring form), as well as pteroyl-L-glutamic acid and pteroyl-L-glutamate, are forms of the water-soluble vitamin B9. Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its biological importance is due to tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives after its conversion to dihydrofolic acid in the liver.<br>
(1)	Human	reproduction- Folate deficiency during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm delivery, infant low birth weight, and fetal growth retardation. Folate deficiency in the mother increases homocysteine<br>
level in the blood which may lead to spontaneous abortion and pregnancy complications such as placental abruption and preeclampsia.<br>
(2)	Heart	disease-Folic acid is a safe and effective supplement that targets large artery stiffness and may prevent isolated systolic hypertension.it may improve the integrity of the vascular endothelium.<br>
(3)	Stroke-Folic	acid appears to reduce the risk of stroke. Folic supplements are inexpensive and relatively safe to use and that is why stroke or hyperhomocysteinemia patients are encouraged to consume daily B vitamins including folid acid.<br>
(4)	Infectious disease-Folate deficiency is linked to anemia causing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in areas such as Colombia where malaria has reached endemic proportions.<br>
(5)	Bone	loss in Parkinson's disease (PD)-Folate lowers homocysteine (Hey) levels which in turn prevents bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients taking levodopa (a psychoactive drug taken to treat Parkinson's disease). Improvements in bone health include increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total femur, and femur shaft.<br>
(6)	Schizophrenia-Folate	deficiency may increase the risk of schizophrenia because by increasing homocysteine levels folate also increases interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels and these two cytokines are involved in the development of schizophrenia.<br>
(7)	Renal	disease-Folic acid supplements may reduce the risk of children developing renal diseases or injuries such as microalbuminuria.<br>
Lycopene -It's a symmetrical tetraterpene assembled from 8 isoprene units. Their antioxidant property, substantial scientific and clinical research has been devoted to a possible correlation between lycopene consumption and general health. Early research suggested some amelioration of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and even male infertility. Lycopene helps neutralize harmful free radicals, which are implicated in cancer, heart disease, macular degeneration and other age-related illnesses. The evidence for a benefit was strongest for cancers of the prostate, lung, and stomach. Data were also suggestive of a benefit for cancers of the pancreas, colon and rectum, esophagus, oral cavity, breast, and cervix i <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
