The invention relates  to a process  for preparing (1R,2S,4R)- (-) -2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicycle [2.2 .1] heptane and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts  thereof.<br>
The 2- (E) -butenedioate   (1   :  1)   salt   (fumarate)   of (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicycle[2.2 .1]heptane of<br>
Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is a known anxiolytic active principle having the INN "deramciclane fumarate".<br>
The compound of Formula I falls under the general Formula I of Hungarian patent No.  179,164 but has not been actually and explicitly disclosed in this patent specification,   nor the preparation thereof has been exemplified.  According to Hungarian patent No.   179,164   the alkanol amine  cycloalkyl ethers of its general Formula  I are prepared by reacting   ( + )-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-<br><br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-one, i. e. (+) -camphor of Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with the corresponding organic metal compound, subjecting the adduct obtained to hydrolysis and introducing onto the hydroxy group of the product obtained the basic side chain by etherification. As organic metal compound a Grignard compound or an organic alkali metal compound, preferably lithium or sodium compound, is used.<br>
The preparation of the compound of Formula I has been actually disclosed in Hungarian patent No. 212,574. The essence of this process is that purification of the product is carried out at a later stage of the synthesis. According to the process (+}-camphor of Formula II is subjected to Grignard reaction with phenyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether to give (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl] --bicyclo [2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
with a yield of 28%   (according to GC).   The compound (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]--bicyclo[2.2.l]heptane-2-ol of Formula III is  in the reaction mixture and is not  isolated.   The complex is decomposed,   the reaction mixture is  converted without purification into  the sodium salt by reaction with sodium amide or sodium hydride and the sodium salt obtained is reacted with anhydrous   (2-{chloro}-ethyl)-dimethylamine in toluene as medium.   The reaction mixture contains beside the base   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy)]-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I   (being present in an<br>
amount of 20  to 30%	a considerable amount of<br>
impurities and starting materials,   e.g.  unreacted   ( + ) -camphor of Formula II,    (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7--tri-[methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol,   1,7,7--tri- [methyl] -bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol  and biphenyl, triphenyl impurities  etc.   The base   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[(2'--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl]-1,7,7-tri -- [methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I  is  separated from said contaminations by extraction with aqueous tartaric acid,   whereupon the base is  set free and the fumarate salt is  formed.  The  total amount of unreacted (+)-camphor of Formula  II and   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]--1,7,7-tri- [methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.l]heptane-2-ol of Formula III remains in the organic phase of the tartaric acid extraction step,   which can be re-used in the Griguard reaction after removing the solvent and water   (i.e.   it can be re-circulated into  the process).  Thus  the   (+)-camphor used can be more efficiently utilized;  without re-circulation only about  16% by weight of  the   ( + ) - camphor used can be utilized,   while in case of a one-fold and three-fold re-circulation this value is  increased to 22% by weight and 25% by weight,   respectively.   Thus  the yields  are too  low,  particularly in the view of  the commercial feasibility.<br><br>
It is  very  important  and is  to be emphasized that a considerable part of   ( + ) -camphor of Formula II used in the Grignard reaction does not react and this  starting material cannot be  technically removed from the desired product because of   the physical properties of   ( + ) -camphor and the lability of   the compound   (1R,2S,4R) -(-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-<br>
-	tri-[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2 .l]heptane-2-ol  of  Formula  III<br>
formed since compound   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III  is<br>
susceptible  to decomposition.  For this reason according to<br>
the process  disclosed in Hungarian patent No.   212,574  the<br>
alkylation  step always  takes place in the presence of   (+)-<br>
-camphor of  Formula  II.<br>
The aforesaid gives  rise to  the drawbacks  of  the process disclosed in Hungarian patent No.   212,574.   The alkali hydrides  and amides used in the first step of  the alkylation reaction form salts not only with the alcohol<br>
(1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III but also with<br>
(+)-camphor of Formula II and other compounds containing an active hydrogen atom being present in the reaction mixture. For this reason beside the desired compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) --2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy}]-2-[phenyl]-l,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1]heptane of Formula I  further<br>
alkylated derivatives  formed,   e.g.   from UPreacted<br>
(+)-camphor,   are obtained and the desired compound (1R,2S,4R)- (-) -2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl]-bicyclo[2.2 .1]heptane of<br>
Formula I  is   to be recovered from a mixture containing such<br>
impurities  and also unreacted compounds   (+) -camphor and<br>
(1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formulae II and III.   The crude compound   (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2' -{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy}] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-<br>
-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of  Formula I  can only be purified, though incompletely,   by means of recrystallization from<br><br>
dimethyl  formamide.  However,  with the aid of said recrystallization only non-basic contaminations can be completely  removed,   which do not form salts.<br>
A further disadvantage of recrystallization from dimethyl  formamide is  that the traces of  the solvent  cannot be removed from the desired pharmaceutical active principle  to  the required extent.<br>
It has been found that in case of the alkylation reaction of   (1R,2S,4R) -(-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of formula III carried out with (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dime thy lamina   (+) -camphor of Formula  II being always present gives rise to the formation of considerable amounts  of by-products,   e.  g.   (1R,3S,4R)-3-- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimetbylamino)-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane-2-one of Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The by-product (1R,3S,4R)-3-[ (2 '-{N,N-dimethylamino}-<br>
-ethyl) ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2 -one of<br>
Formula V is formed as follows: under the conditions used<br>
in the etherif ication reaction ( + ) -camphor of Formula II<br>
forms an alkali salt in position 3 which in turn reacts<br>
with the (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine used as<br>
alkylating agent to yield the compound of Formula V. The<br>
amount of the by-product of Formula V may be as high as 1<br>
to 10%.	The solubility of the fumarate 2-(E)-<br>
-butenedioate (1 : 1) of the compound of (1R,3S,4R)-3-- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyD ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br><br>
-bicyclo [2.2 .1] hep tane-2-one of Formula V is  approximately identical with that of the fumarate of  the desired compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-)-2-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2.1]heptane of<br>
Formula I  and therefore crystallizes   together with the<br>
fumarate of  the compound   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2- [(2'-{N,N-<br>
-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I and contaminates  the<br>
desired end product.   If the etherification is  carried out<br>
in toluene,   as described in Hungarian patent No.   212,574,<br>
the product obtained after salt formation in ethanol<br>
contains  considerable amounts of  the  impurity   (1R,3S,4R)-3-<br>
-	[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2,l]heptane-2-one of Formula V.<br>
The salt is a highly unsoluble compound and can be reerystallized only from dimethyl  formamide.  However,   re-crystallization from dimethyl formamide fails  to provide a compound   (1R,2S,4R) - (-)-2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane of Formula I  in a purity required by the Pharmacopoeias for  the following reasons:<br>
a)	The product obtained after recrystallization from<br>
dimethyl formamide still contains the compound<br>
(lR,3S,4R)-3-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)]-<br>
-1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .l]heptane-2-one<br>
of Formula V in an amount above the threshold<br>
value permitted by Pharmacopoeia   (about  0.5%);<br>
b)	Dimethyl  formamide has  a high boiling point and<br>
cannot be removed from the product in the<br>
required degree because at  the high temperature<br>
decomposition of  the product takes place.<br>
A purification to yield products with a purity sufficient for medicaments  according to  the Pharmacopoeias  could<br><br>
not be attained by usual purification processes, such as recrystallization from solvents or fractional distillation.<br>
Taking into consideration the severe requirements of Pharmacopoeia, impurities being present in too high amounts may endanger the use of the active principle for pharmaceutical purposes. The impurity (1R,3S,4R)-3-[(2 ' --{N,N-dimethylamino&gt;-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-one of Formula V may therefore cause problems in the use of the compound (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-<br>
-	[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of Formula I as  active<br>
principle.<br>
As  a summary,   it can be stated that when purifying the (1R,2S,4R) - (-} -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1]heptane of<br>
Formula I prepared by the known method,   dimethyl  fonnamide<br>
would be the only conceivable solvent.  However,   this<br>
recrystallization method is unsuitable for the preparation<br>
of a pharmaceutical active ingredient meeting the<br>
requirements of the Pharmacopoeias,  because dimethyl<br>
f ormamide has  such a high boiling point that traces   thereof cannot be removed from the product to a sufficient extent. At the high temperature required the compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -(N/N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) 3 -2-<br>
-	[phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane of<br>
Formula I is  subject to decomposition.<br>
As already disclosed above,   (+)-camphor of Formula II is present during the alkylation reaction.   From  (+)-camphor as  further contamination   (1R, 4R) -2- [ (2 ' -(N,N-dimethyl-amino}-ethoxy)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1]heptane of Formula<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is formed. If an alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide<br>
is used as basic salt forming agent, the amount of the<br>
contamination (1R,4R) -2- [ (2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -<br>
-1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane of Formula IV is<br>
1 to 10%.	The compound (1R,4R) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-	dime thy lrnnino}-e thoxyfl -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane of Formula IV has been known from the Prior Art [Yakugaku Zasshi, 7_5, 1377, (1955); Chem., Abstr. 9340 (1956)3. The compound (1R,4R)-2-[(2'-{N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of Formula IV is formed as follows: the alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide used for sodium salt formation in the etherification step reduces 1 to 10%.         of (•«•)-camphor of Formula II to borneol which is converted under the reaction conditions used into the alkali metal salt and said alkali salt enters with (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine into an alkylation reaction. However, the borneol ether (1R,4R) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-<br>
-	dime thy lamino) - ethoscyf)] -1,7,7- tri - [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2.2 .1]heptane of Formula IV can be separated from the desired compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2' -{N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of Formula I in the course of working up the reaction mixture.<br><br>
The problem underlying to  the invention is  to provide a process  for preparing   (1R,2S,4R) - {-) -2- [ (2'-{N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of  Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts  thereof with a higher grade of purity without the necessity of recrystallization purification steps which anyhow would lead only to an insufficient purification and would reduce the yield and moreover would have the drawback that the residual solvent could not be removed from the end product to a sufficient extent  even by complicated methods.<br>
Surprisingly the above has been solved by the present invention.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising recognition  that  if  the reaction between the reaction mixture containing the compound  (1R,2S,4R) -(-) -2- [phenyl] --1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.l]heptane-2-ol of Formula III and   (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine  is  carried out  in tbe presence of an alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide in a medium containing 1 or more compound(s)   having a 5-   or  6-membered saturated heterocyclic ring with 2  oxygen ring atoms as   [a]   solvent (s),  particularly dioxane,   the reaction is directed by far in favour of  the formation of the desired   (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2' -{N,N-dime thylamino }--ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-[methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I and the by-product (lR,3S,4R)-3-[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)]-l,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1]heptane-2-one of Formula V is<br>
formed only in a minimal  amount.  The above recognition<br>
enables  the preparation of  the desired compound   (1R,2S,4R)-<br>
-	(-) -2- [(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-<br>
tri-[methyl]-bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of Formula I  in higher<br>
yields  and with a higher grade of purity,  particularly<br>
considering the impurity   (1R,3S,4R)-3-[(2'-<br>
-{N,N-dime thylamino}-ethyl) ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br><br>
-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-one of Formula V. Thereby a compound (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2.1] heptane of Formula I which directly meets the requirements of Pharmacopoeia as regards the purity and the content of residual solvents can be obtained.<br>
In the entire text the percentages regarding the contents of the compounds of Formulae I an V and of other compounds are the result of gas chromatographic analysis they being the ratio of the area under the given peak and the total area under all the peaks.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" used in the present patent specification means salts formed with inorganic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or organic acids, e.g. acetic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, maleic acid or fumaric acid. The salt formed with fumaric acid possesses particularly useful properties.<br>
The (1R,2S,4R)- (-)-2-[{2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] --2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo[2 .2.1]heptane of Formula I has three asymmetrical centres, namely in positions 1, 2 and 4.<br>
Hence the subject matter of the invention is a process for preparing the (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[(2'--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy) ] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-- [methyl]-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof by converting ( + ) -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .l]heptane-2--one {(+)-camphor} of Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
into   (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-[methyl] -bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
by reacting the  former with a metallo-organic compound,   if necessary carrying out a decomposition,   conveniently hydrolysis,   of  the reaction product,   and reacting the (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2 .1]heptane-2-ol of Formula III thus obtained with a   (2-{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine in the presence of a basic salt  forming agent in an organic solvent and,   if desired,   converting the base   (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [ (2 ' -{N,N--dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane of  Formula I  thus  obtained into a<br><br>
salt, characterised by carrying out the reaction of (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-l,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 .1]heptane-2-ol of Formula III and (2--{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine in a medium containing 1 or more compound(s) having a 5- or 6-membered saturated heterocyclic ring with 2 oxygen ring atoms as [a] solvent (s) . The invention is not limited to the use of 1 or more compound (s) having a 5- or 6-membered saturated heterocyclic ring with 2 oxygen ring atoms, such as dioxane as the sole solvent (s) but also comprises the use of solvents containing at least 50% by weight, preferably 75% by weight, of 1 or more compound (s) having a 5- or 6--membered saturated heterocyclic ring with 2 oxygen ring atoms, such as dioxane.<br>
The essential feature of the process of the present invention is that the alkylation is carried out in a solvent which does not favour the alkylation reaction in position 3 of (+) -camphor of Formula II in the presence of a basic salt forming agent. It has been found that compounds having a 5- or 6-membered saturated heterocyclic ring with 2 oxygen ring atoms, particularly dioxane, can be used advantageously for this purpose.<br>
Particularly preferably as a solvent dioxane is used. Another example is dioxolane.<br>
Conveniently a    phenyl     magnesium halide is  sed as a metallo-organic compound in a Grigmard type reaction. Further examples are phenylalkali compounds, such as phenyl1ithium.<br>
Preferably phenyl magnesium bromide is used. Phenyl magnesium chloride can also be used.<br><br>
Suitably the process according to the invention may be carried out as follows:<br>
In the first step of the process of the present invention ( + ) -camphor of Formula II is subjected to Grignard reaction with, for example, phenyl magnesium bromide. The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se. As reaction medium preferably tetrahydrofurane may be used. Phenyl magnesium bromide may be used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles, preferably about 1.5 mole, related to 1 mole of  (+)-camphor of Formula II. One may proceed preferably by preparing first the Grignard reagent from magnesium and bromo benzene in the solvent used and thereafter adding the solution of the ( +) -camphor of Formula II in an organic solvent at the boiling point of the reaction mixture. It is preferred to use the same solvent for the preparation of the Grignard reagent and the dissolving of the ( + ) -camphor of Formula II. As a solvent advantageously tetrahydrofurane may be used. Advantageously the reaction is carried out at the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture is then cooled and the adduct obtained is hydrolysed. Hydrolysis may be carried out in a known manner, preferably in acidic medium. It is preferred to use hydrochloric acid for this purpose.<br>
The (1R,2S,4R) -(-)-2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ol of Formula III obtained after<br>
decomposition0 of the Grignard complex can be subjected to alkylation without purifying the reaction mixture containing the same. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of unreacted (+)-camphor of Formula II. However, this leads to the formation only of a minor amount of alkylated by-products because according to the process of the present invention the formation of (1R,3S,4R)-3--[(2'-{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethyl)] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2 .l]heptane-2-one of Formula V is suppressed.<br><br>
As already mentioned above,   alkylation is  carried out in a solvent  which does not favour the alkylation reaction in position  3   of   ( + ) -camphor of  Formula II,   i.e.   in which ( + ) -camphor  of  Formula II  is alkylated in position 3  at most only to  a. very small  extent.   It  is particularly preferred to  use dioxane as organic  solvent because in a medium containing dioxane  the alkylation of   ( + ) -camphor of Formula  II  takes place at most only to a very small  extent and consequently  the amount of  the undesired   (1R,3S,4R)-3-<br>

-2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2 .1] heptane of<br>
Formula  I  is   low.<br>

and 4  are derived from the   ( + ) -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -<br>
-bicyclo[2 .2 .1] heptane-2-one  {(+)-camphor) of Formula II.<br>
The alkylation is  carried out in the presence of a basic salt  forming agent.   The term "basic salt forming agent" means  basic compounds which convert the hydroxy group into a  salt.   For this purpose advantageously alkali metal amides,   e.g.   sodium amide,   or alkali metal hydrides, e.g.   sodium hydride,  may be used.   It  is preferred to use sodium amide.<br>
Preferably as  a   (2-{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine (2-{chloro}-ethyl) -dimethylamine is used.<br>
Suitably  the basic  salt forming agent is used in an amount of  1   to  3 moles,   preferably 1.5  to 2 moles,   related to  1 mole of   the   (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[phenyl]-1,7,7-tri-<br>
-	[methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .1] heptane-2-ol  of Formula  III.   The<br>
amount of  the  alkylating agent is advantageously 1.0  to 2.5<br><br>
moles,   preferably 1  to 1.1 mole,   related to  the basic  salt forming agent.   Preferably  the alkylation reaction of (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo [2 .2 . 1] heptane-2-ol of Formula III with the   (2--{halogeno}-ethyl) -dimethylamine is carried out under heating,   particularly at  the boiling point of the reaction mixture.   Suitably  the reaction takes place within about 3 to  5  hours.  An advantageous reaction time is about 4 hours.<br>
The   (1R, 2S, 4R) - (-} -2 - [ (2 ' - (N, N-dime thy lamino} -ethoxy) ] --2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2 .2.1] heptane of Formula I may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,   preferably the fumarate,   optionally without isolation of  the  former.   One may preferably proceed as   follows:   from the  reaction mixture obtained after alkylation  the  inorganic salts are removed by filtration at 0   to 30 °C,   preferably at 20°C,  whereupon the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid,  preferably fumaric acid, is  added to  the  filtrate in an approximately equimolar amount   (1.0  to  1.5 mole).   The crystalline product precipitated  from the medium,   such as  the dioxane medium, is  filtered off.<br>
Since the   (1R,2S,4R) - (-)-2-[ (2 '-{N,N-dimethylamino}--ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri-[methyl]-bicyclo [2.2.1]heptane of Formula  I  or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts   thereof,   particularly the   (1R,2S,4R) - (-) -2-<br>

by the process  according to  the invention contain [s]   at<br>
most  low amounts  of   (1R,3S,4R) -3- [(2 ' -{N,N-dimethylamino}-<br>
-ethyl) ] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] -bicyclo [2.2 .l]heptane-2-one of<br>
Formula V or of  the pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salt  thereof,   respectively,  by the process<br>
according to  the invention it can be worked without<br>
recrystallization from dimethyl formamide anyhow leading<br>
only  to  insufficient purification used by known methods and<br><br>
consequently without removal of traces of dimethyl formamide from the pharmaceutically active principle by methods unsuitable for the given purpose, too. Also this latter is a significant progress in view of the impossibility to remove dimethyl formamide to the necessary extent because of its high boiling temperature at which (1R,2S,4R)-(-)-2-[2'--{N,N-dimethylamino}-ethoxy)] -2- [phenyl] -1,7,7-tri- [methyl] --bicyclo[2.2 .l]heptane of Formula I would be decomposed.<br>
The advantage of the process of the present invention is that it can be carried out with excellent yields and a highly pure product is obtained. Thus the yield of about 46% shown in the Examples is considerably higher than the yields disclosed in the Prior Art which do not surpass 25% even if (+)-camphor is re-circulated several times.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. The melting points given in the Examples are uncorrected values.<br><br>

The mixture is heated to boiling for 2 hours, whereupon 113.0 g (1.05 mole) of (2-{chloro}-ethyl)--dimethylamine are added and the reaction mixture is heated to boiling for a. further period of 4 hours.<br>
