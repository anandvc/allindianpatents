Substituted imidazopyrimidines for the prevention and treatment of cancer<br>
The present invention relates to new compounds, and the use thereof for the chemoprevention and treatment of both precancerous lesions [e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and actinic keratoses (AKs)] and cancer (e.g. colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder or skin cancer).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, with an overall mortality exceeding 40%. About 15% of patients with CRC report a family history of the disease. Hereditary CRC generally develops from two syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). FAP is caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and is characterized by the early development of multiple adenomas in the large intestine. If these lesions are not removed, they may progress to carcinomas.<br>
Approximately 9 0% of all CRC cases and deaths are thought to be .preventable. The objective of chemopreventive strategies is to avoid the formation of adenomatous polyps and their subsequent progression to CRC. Chemopreventive agents can act at various levels, by increasing apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation, and/or decreasing carcinogen-induced DNA damage- A number of pharmacological agents have been studied for the prevention of CRC, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors. The inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity underlies part of the preventative action of these compounds (there is an over expression of COX-2 in. tumour<br><br>
cells), although COX-2-independent mechanisms have also been described- (Hsu A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 11397-403). Some NSAID derivatives that do not inhibit COX, retain their chemopreventive activity on precancerous and cancerous processes, thereby acting through a mechanism independent of COX inhibition (Piazza G.A. Cancer Res. 1997, 57, 2909-15).<br>
Actinic keratosis (AK) and skin cancer are increasingly frequent dermatological diseases in the population.. They appear in regions of chronic sun exposure such as the face and the back of” the hands. Although the exact incidence of AK is unknown, 40-50% of Australians over 40 years of age harbour AK, and the incidence increases with age. There is strong evidence that AK can progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), in fact, approximately 60% of SCC arise from pre-existing AK, The incidence of skin cancer is increasing due to many factors, including greater life expectancy of the population and increases in ambiental ultraviolet radiation. UV light induces molecular signalling pathways and results in specific genetic alterations (i.e. mutation of p53) that are likely critical to skin cancer development. It has been shown that celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, reduces the development of murine UVB-induced skin tumours, although its precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Additionally, recent reports on cyclooxygenase knockout-fibroblasts confirm that some of the antiproliferative and antineoplastic effects of NSAIDs are independent .of the inhibition of either COX-1 or COX-2 (Zhang X. J. Exp. Med. 1999, 190, 451-459).<br>
The development of safe and effective NSAIDs for chemoprevention is complicated by the fact that severe toxicity may counteract the benefits of treatment with these drugs when administered to healthy individuals who have a low probability of developing the disease. Moreover, there is’<br><br>
increasing concern due to the risk of serious gastrointestinal reactions, cardiovascular safety, and the potential for serious skin reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, related to the use of COX-2 inhibitors, that currently limits their clinical application to the prevention • and/or treatment of precancerous lesions and cancer. Thus, the development of new, less toxic, and more efficient therapeutic agents’for these pathologies is essential.<br>
Among the many antiproliferative compounds proposed, there are some that are structurally similar to the present invention, such as those of the following formulae, described in documents WO 99/51590 and US 5700826, that are still in the development phase.<br>
WO 00/08024 discloses some compounds that are ‘structurally similar to those of the present invention. Such compounds are selective COX-2 inhibitors, and as such, are useful for the treatment of inflammation and cancer.<br>
Wang and collaborators (J\ Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 1697-1711) have described 4,5-diphenylimidazo derivatives having potent antitubulin and cytotoxic activity.<br><br><br>
For the aforementioned reasons, ■ it is necessary to provide new compounds for chemoprevention and treatment of both precancerous lesions and cancer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibit the proliferation of, and induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines, through a COX-2 independent pathway, thereby minimizing the toxicity associated with COX-2 inhibition.<br>
The present invention relates to a compound of general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein:<br>
Ai / A2, A3, A4, A5, Bi, B2, B3, B4 y B5 are radi cal s independently selected from the group consisting of H, (C1-C4) -alkyl, (C3-C7) -cycloalkyl, CF3, OCF3/ CN, (CH2)nORl, (CH2)nNRlR2, C0NR1R2, F, Cl”, Br, I, NR1R2, NR2C0R1, 0R1, COR1, COOR1, COSR1, OCOR1, SRI, SOR1, S (0)OH, SO2R1, SO2NR2R3, SO2NHCOR1/ and SCOR1; wherein n is an integer from 1 to 3; Rl is a radical selected from H, CH20C0R2, CF3, (C1-C4) -alkyl, and (C3-C7) -cycloalkylmethyl and (C3-C7) -cycloalkyl; R2 is a radical selected from H, and<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention may have one or more chiral centres. The present invention includes each one of the possible stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, particularly racemic mixtures thereof. A single enantiomer may be prepared by any of the commonly used processes/ for example, by chromatographic separation of the racemic mixture on a stationary chiral phase, by resolution of ‘ the racemic mixture by fractional crystallization techniques of the diastereomeric salts, by•chiral synthesis, by enzymatic resolution or by biotransformation.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, among others, addition salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric and phosphoric, as well as addition salts - of organic acids ‘ such as acetic,<br><br>
benzenesulphonic, benzole, camphorsulphonic, mandelic, methanesulphonic, oxalic, succinic, fumaric, tartaric, and maleic. Likewise, an acid proton in compounds of formula (I)-may be substituted by a metallic ion, for example, ■ an alkaline metal ion, an alkaline-earth metal ion or an aluminium ion; or may be coordinated with an organic or inorganic base. An acceptable organic base includes diethylamine and triethylamine. An acceptable inorganic base includes aluminium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide. There may be more than one cation or anion depending on the number of functions with charge and on the valence of cations and anions.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms such as, for example, hydrates.. The present invention encompasses all such above-mentioned forms that are pharmaceutically active. Some of the compounds of general formula (I) may exhibit polymorphism, encompassing the present invention all the possible polymorphic forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using the methods described below, as well as other processes known in the field of organic synthesis. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, the general processes shown in the attached schemes.<br>
According to Scheme 1, ct-bromodesoxybenzoine (III) may be obtained by bromination of desoxybenzoine (II) by using Br2”/HBr/AcOH, Br2/CCl4, or CuBr2 in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) . The reaction of compound (III) with 2-aminopyrimidine (IV), in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate or an excess of aminopyrimidine, gives a mixture of compounds (la) and (Ib).<br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 2, the starting desoxybenzoine (II) may be prepared at least by one of these four different routes: route 1 consists in a Friedel-Crafts reaction of an aromatic substrate (VI) with a substituted phenacetyl chloride (V) ; route 2 consists in a Perkin condensation between a benzaldehyde (VIII) and a phenylacetic acid derivative (VII) to yield a 2,3-diphenylacrilic acid, followed by Curtius rearrangement, and subsequent hydrolytic treatment; route 3 consists in the addition of a benzylmagnesiane (IX) over benzaldehyde (VIII), and subsequent oxidation of the compound obtained; and route 4 consists in the addition of benzonitrile (X) to the-benzylmagnesiane (IX) .<br><br><br><br><br>
When in compound (I) either one of Ai to A5 or one of Bi to B5 (being the rest of them as defined above) is a methylsulfide, this may be transformed in the corresponding sulfonamide as shown in Scheme 4 (where only the sulfonamide substituent on ring A is represented, although the same applies for ring B7 and where the rest of the positions on A and B ring may be substituted as defined above) . Thus, the methylsulfide (XV) is oxidized with metachloroperbenzoic acid (jnCPBA) to obtain the sulfoxide (XVI), Pummerer reaction of (XVI) affords the acetoxymethylthio (XVII), which can be oxidized with monoperoxyphthalic acid magnesium salt hexahydrate (MMPP) to give compound (XVIII) . The treatment of (XVIII) with NaOH (IN) in MeOH allows to obtain the sulf inate (XIX) . This is first treated with sulfuryl chloride in dichloromethane (DCM) r and then with aqueous ammonium hydroxide in tetrahydrofurane (THF) to yield the sulfonamide (XX).<br><br>
Compound (XVIII) may be also converted in the sulfonamide (XX) by treatment- with NaOAc and K2CO3 followed by reaction with HOSA. (hydroxylamina-O-sulfonic acid) .<br><br>
For purposes of simplicity, the possible substitituents in A and B rings in the scheme 4 above are not shown.<br>
Alternatively, sulfonamide (XX) may be obtained starting from sulfoxide (XVI) by successive reactions with: a) TFAA (trifluoroacetic anhydride); b) triethylamine in MeOH; c) chlorine in acetic acid; and, finally, d) ammonium hydroxide.<br><br>
N-acetylation of sulfamoyl group in (XX) with .acetic anhydride in presence of triethylamine allows to obtain its corresponding acetyl derivative (XXI) . On the other hand, the compound (XX) where B3 is a sulfonamide may also be obtained starting from compound (II) where B3 is H by chlorosulfonation and subsequent amination.<br>
As shown in scheme 5, some substitutions on the pyrimidine ring (i.e. PI, P2 and P3), may be obtained by treatment of hydroxyimidazopyrimidine (XXII) with phosphorous oxychloride to yield the chloroderivative (XXIII), which then can be reacted either with thiourea to give the corresponding mercaptan (XXIV), or with an alcohol or amine to give the corresponding ether (XXV) or aminoderivative (XXVI), respectively.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may induce apoptosis of cancerous and/or precancerous cells. Thus, an aspect of the present invention relates to the use of said compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for the chemoprevention and treatment of both a precancerous lesion (such as, familial adenomatous polyposis, and actinic keratoses) and a cancer (particularly, colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, or skin cancer) . Therefore, this aspect of the invention is related to a method for the prophylactic and/or curative treatment of an animal, including a human, suffering from the above-mentioned pathologies, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) -<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the compound (I), as an active ingredient, together with appropiate amounts of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Preferably, the compound is administered orally, parenterally or topically.<br>

Determination of apoptosis<br>
To stablish whether the antiproliferative activity of the compounds of the present invention is due to an apoptotic process, and not merely to a necrotic process, the generation of DNA fragments associated to histones (mono- and oligonucleosomes) was determined after incubation of the human colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 with the compounds of the present invention at different concentrations. DNA fragmentation into nucleosomes, which is an indicator of apoptosis phenomena, was quantified by a sandwich inmunoassay using monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche Diagnostics, cat #1920685). The quantity of fragmented DNA was expressed with the Enrichment Factor (EF) parameter, which is a coefficient of absorbance of nucleosomes liberated in the cytosol of the cells cultured in the presence of the products’compared with control cells.<br>

The inhibitory capacity of cell proliferation of the compounds was determined in two human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT-116) obtained at the ATCC (American Type Collection). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates and kept at 3 7QC in a CO2 heater for 24 hours to allow cell-substrate-adhesion. Subsequently; cells were treated with the products under study at concentrations comprised between 1 and 10 0 /iM for 48 hours- After the treatment period, the medium was removed and cells were dyed with Sulforodamine B. Finally, decolouration of the dyed cells was carried out with Tris base 10 mM and the plates were read at 493-530 nm in a plate reader. IC50 was calculated as the product concentration inducing a growth inhibition of the 5 0% compared with control cells not treated.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are more potent than celecoxib as antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic agents, but much less potent than celecoxib as COX-2 inhibitory agents. These results and the fact that the human cancer cell line HCT-116 does not express COX-2 isoenzyme show that their mechanism of action is independent of their COX-2 inhibitory properties.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
