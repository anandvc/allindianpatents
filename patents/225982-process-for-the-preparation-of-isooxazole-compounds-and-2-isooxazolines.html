				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ISOOXAZOLE<br>
COMPOUNDS AND 2-ISOOXAZOLINES<br>
This application claims the benefit of the priority of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/328,901, filed October 12, 2001, the disclosure of which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
The present invention relates to substituted isoxazoles and 2-isoxazolines, and<br>
processes for their preparation. In addition the invention relates to compounds that serve<br>
as useful intermediates in the preparation of these heterocycles. Substituted isoxazoles<br>
are useful in the treatment of inflammation and inflammation-related disorders, including<br>
arthritis.<br>
Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) have demonstrated effective<br>
anti-inflammatory activity. Other antiinflammatory agents, e.g., NSAIDs, inhibit both<br>
the constitutive form of cyclooxygenase (COX-1), and the inducible form of the enzyme,<br>
COX-2.<br>
COX-1 is a constitutive cyclooxygenase isoform and is mainly responsible for the<br>
synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the GI tract and the synthesis of<br>
thromboxane which triggers platelet aggregation in blood platelets. COX-2 is inducible<br>
and short-lived except in the case of certain tumors where it is constitutively activated.<br>
COX-2 expression is stimulated in response to endotoxins, cytokines, hormones, growth<br>
factors and mitogens. These observations suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 serve<br>
different physiological and pathophysiological functions. It has been suggested that<br>
COX-2 activity is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where<br>
induction of the enzyme occurs in response to inflammatory agents, hormones, growth<br>
factors and cytokines. United States Patent No. 5,604,253, incorporated herein by<br>
reference, for a discusses the advantages of selective COX-2 inhibition. Principally, a<br>
selective COX-2 inhibitor is expected to possess similar antiinflammatory, antipyretic<br>
and analgesic properties to conventional NSAIDs but with reduced potential for<br>
gastrointestinal toxicity, and a reduced potential for renal side effects.<br>
A particularly effective structural class of selective COX-2 inhibitors are the 3,4-<br>
diaryl-substituted isoxazoles. For example, the compound, 4-[5-methyl-3-phenyl-<br>
isoxazol-l-yl]benzenesulfonamide (also known as Valdecoxib®) is useful for the<br>
treatment of a number of inflammation disorders, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. In addition, the sodium salt of N-[[(5-methyl-3-phenylisoxazol-4-yl)-<br><br>
phenyl]sulfonyl]propanamide (also known as Parecoxib®), a prodrug of Valdecoxib®, is<br>
particularly effective in parenteral compositions for acute pain management.<br><br>
Talley et al. (United States Patent No. 5,932,598 and J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43,<br>
775-777) disclose the preparation of Valdecoxib® and related derivatives from<br>
deoxybenzoin. In the preparation, deoxybenzoin is treated with hydroxylamine, and the<br>
resulting oxime is deprotonated and condensed with an ester, e.g., ethyl acetate, to form<br>
an isoxazoline intermediate. The isoxazoline intermediate is converted to Valdecoxib®<br>
by treatment with chlorosulphonic acid, followed by aqueous ammonia. Parecoxib<br>
sodium® can be prepared by acylation of Valdecoxib® with propionic anhydride (Talley<br>
et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 1661-1663).<br>
Also of interest for their COX-2 inhibitory activity and antiinflammatory activity<br>
are closely related analogs of Valdecoxib®, as well as processes for their preparation.<br>

are provided. In addition the invention provides substituted 2-isoxazolines of the<br>
formula IX<br><br>
and processes for their preparation. The 2-isoxazoline compounds of the formula IX are<br>
structurally similar to the isoxazole compounds of the formula I as the isoxazoline<br>
compounds are 4,5-dihydro analogs of the isoxazole compounds. In addition to their<br>
structural similarity, their synthetic preparations share analogous reaction pathways and<br>
certain common synthetic intermediates. The processes of the invention have been<br>
developed from readily available and inexpensive starting materials. In addition, the<br>
processes provide high yields of substituted isoxazoles and 2-isoxazolines.<br>
Substituted Isoxazoles (Compound of the Formula I)<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of the formula I<br><br>
 Kl<br>
wherein R1, Y and Z are as described above in the summary.<br>
The nitrile oxide is generally generated in situ from the oxime of the formula III<br>
by oxidation with a suitable oxidizing agent, e.g. N-chloro-p-toluenesulfonamide,<br>
sodium salt; alkaline sodium hypochlorite; chlorine; N-bromosuccinimide; lead<br>
tetraacetate, in an alcohol solvent, e.g., methanol. The nitrile oxide (isolated after water<br>
workup) is added directly to the alkyne of the formula IV in an alcohol solvent, e.g.,<br>
ethanol, and the reaction mixture is heated to about 70 °C to about 80 °C for about 30<br>
minutes to about 6 h, preferably about 3 h to give the desired isoxazole. Preferably,<br>
equimolar amounts of the nitrile oxide and the alkyne of the formula IV are used. After<br>
water workup the organic layer is concentrated to isolate the crude substituted isoxazole<br>
of the formula I. The compound of the formula I can be further purified by<br>
recrystallization in suitable solvents such as ethanol.<br>
In certain embodiments, particularly wherein R1 is a group of the formula II<br>
(phenyl or substituted phenyl) in the alkyne of the formula III, the cycloaddition step<br>
may result in mixtures of regioisomers. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, these mixture can be separated by well-known separation techniques, e.g.,<br>
chromatography, recrystallization, and the like, to obtain the desired regioisomer.<br>
Various acid addition salts of the compound of the formula I can be prepared by<br>
treatment with an organic or inorganic acid. Preferably, the acid addition salts formed<br>
are pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as those described in United States Patent No.<br>
5,563,165, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Suitable base<br>
addition salts of the compound of formula I, wherein the phenyl group at the 5-position<br>
of the pyrazole ring incorporates a carboxy or hydroxyl substituent. Base addition salts<br><br>
include metallic addition salts, e.g., sodium, potassium, and organic base addition salts,<br>
e.g, organic amines. Other pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are detailed in<br>
United States Patent No. 5,563,165.<br>
Preparation of Alkvnes of the Formula IV. wherein R1 is Cj-C$ Alkyl or Hydrogen<br>
In embodiments of the invention where R1 is C1-C6 alkylj, the alkyne of the<br>
formula IV<br><br>
can be obtained by deprotonation of a methyl ketone of the formula V<br><br>
wherein Y is as described above, with a strong base, e.g., lithium diisopropylamide, in an<br>
anhydrous ethereal solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature below 5 °C, preferably<br>
about 0 °C. Typically, a slight molar excess of the strong base is used in the<br>
deprotonation step, preferably about 5 to 10% molar excess. The deprotonation is<br>
carried out for a period of about 15 to 45 minutes, preferably about 30 minutes. A<br>
chlorophosphate reagent, preferably diethyl chlorophosphate, is subsequently added to<br>
the reaction mixture to form a phosphonate intermediate that is typically not isolated.<br>
The solution containing the phosphonate intermediate is then treated with at least two<br>
molar equivalents of strong base, e.g., lithium diisopropylamide, at a temperature of<br>
about -10 °C to about 10 °C, preferably about 0 °C. An alkylating agent of the formula<br>
VI<br>
R1-Q (VI)<br>
wherein Q is a leaving group, e.g., halide, mesylate, tosylate and the like, can be added to<br>
the reaction mixture, and the resulting mixture is heated to provide the alkyne of formula<br>
IV. A cosolvent such as hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) can be added to the<br>
reaction mixture to enhance the efficiency of the alkyne formation. The alkyne of the<br>
formula IV is typically used directly in the [3+2] cycloaddition step without isolation. In<br>
preferred embodiments, wherein R1 is methyl, methyl iodide is a preferred alkylating<br>
agent.<br><br>
In embodiments of the process wherein Y is phenyl substituted by a group of the<br>
formula—SO2R2, wherein R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, the methyl ketones of the formula V can be<br>
prepared by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example,<br>
acetophenone can be reacted with alkyl sulfonyl halides e.g., CH3SO2F, in Friedel-Craft<br>
type reactions. Alternatively, methyl ketones containing alkyl sulfonyl substituents can<br>
be prepared by oxidation of phenyl alkyl thioethers.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the process, wherein Y is phenyl substituted<br>
by a group of the formula—SO2R2, wherein R2 is amino, the methyl ketones of the<br>
formula V can be prepared by treating the acetophenone of the formula XV, with<br>
ammonium hydroxide at room temperature as depicted in the preparation of 4-<br>
sulfamylacetophenone (Va) in Scheme 1. The sulfonamido moiety can be acylated with<br>
an acylating agent of the formula XIX, wherein R6 is C1-C5 alkyl, preferably C1-C3 alkyl,<br>
in the presence of a trialkylamine base, e.g. triethylamine, to give the compound of the<br>
formula XXI, wherein R6 is C1-C5 alkyl.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Preparation of Alkynes of the Formula IV. wherein R1 is Trifluoromethyl<br>
The alkyne of the formula IV wherein R1 is trifluoromethyl can be prepared from<br>
a substituted phenyl acetylene of the formula VII<br><br>
wherein Y is as described above, by forming the corresponding acetylide using a strong<br>
base, e.g., n-butyl lithium, in an ethereal solvent, e.g., tetrahydrofuran, and then<br>
alkylating the acetylide with a trifluoromethyl alkylating reagent such as S-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-4-fluorophenyl-3-nitrophenylsulfonium triflate (prepared as<br>
described in Yang et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63,2656) to give the alkyne of the formula<br>
IVb<br><br><br>
The reaction is typically conducted at temperatures of -80 °C to 25 °C, preferably about -<br>
-78 °C for about 2 to about 5 hours.<br>
Preparation of Alkynes of the Formula IV Wherein R1 is a Group of the Formula II<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 are as described above, can be obtained by the method depicted in<br>
Scheme 2. An alkene of the formula Xb (obtained by the method described below) is<br>
first treated with bromine in a suitable inert organic solvent, e.g., chloroform, at room<br>
temperature for a sufficient amount of time to form a dibromo intermediate at about<br>
room temperature. The dibromo intermediate is subsequently treated with a base, such<br>
as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g., potassium, sodium, or lithium hydroxide, in an alcohol<br>
solvent, e.g., ethanol, at temperatures of about 60 to about 100 °C to effect elimination of<br>
HBr and provide the alkyne of formula IVa. The alkyne of the formula IVa can be<br>
further purified by, for example, by recrystallization from suitable solvents, e.g.,<br>
alcohols, when the compound is a solid. Alternatively, the compound of the formula IVa<br>
can be purified by techniques such as chromatography or distillation (in the case of<br>
liquids).<br>
In an alternative procedure, the alkyne of the formula IV, wherein R1 is a group<br>
of the formula II can be obtained by treating a substituted phenyl acetylene of the<br>
formula VII<br><br>
Ul<br><br>
wherein Y is as described above, with a copper (II) salt, and reacting the resulting copper<br>
acetylide with a compound of the formula VIII<br><br>
wherein Q' is chloro, bromo or iodo, preferably iodo. Typically, the corresponding<br>
copper acetylide of the substituted phenyl acetylene of the formula VII is generated by<br>
reaction with the copper II salt, e.g., copper sulfate in the presence of aqueous ammonia<br>
and hydroxylamine.<br>

The compounds of the formula IX contain two chiral carbon atoms at positions 4<br>
and 5 of the isoxazoline nucleus. The present invention is meant to comprehend all<br>
stereoisomers of the compound of the formula IX including isolated optical isomers,<br>
isolated diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof (including pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts thereof). In addition, other chiral carbon atoms may also be present in the<br>
i<br>
compound.<br>
Diastereoisomers can be isolated by well-known techniques including<br>
chromatography and recrystallization techniques. Isolated optical isomers may be<br>
purified from racemic mixtures by well-known chiral separation techniques. According<br>
to one such method, a racemic mixture of a compound having the structure of formula IX<br>
or chiral intermediate thereof, is separated into 99% wt.% pure optical isomers by HPLC<br>
using a suitable chiral column, such as a column containing a packing of chiral phase<br>
material bonded to silica gel.<br>
The compound of the formula IX<br><br><br>
wherein R1, Y and Z are as described above in the summary section, can be obtained by a<br>
[3+2] cycloaddition of a nitrile oxide obtained from the oxidation of the oxime of the<br>
formula III<br>
and an alkene of the formula X <br>
The nitrile oxide is generated from the oxime as described above in the synthesis of the<br>
isoxazole compound of the formula I. The nitrile oxide is typically mixed with the<br>
alkene of the formula X in an alcohol solvent, e.g., ethanol, and the resulting mixture is<br>
heated to about 50 °C to about 100 °C for about 30 minutes to about 6 hours, preferably<br>
about 3 hours to give the desired substituted-2-isoxazoline. Preferably, equimolar<br>
amounts of the nitrile oxide and the alkene of the formula X are used. After water<br>
workup, the organic layer is concentrated to isolate the compound of the formula IX.<br>
The compound of the formula IX can be further purified by recrystallization in suitable<br>
solvents such as methanol.<br>
In certain embodiments, particularly wherein R1 is a group of the formula II<br>
(substituted or unsubstituted phenyl) in the alkene of the formula X, the cycloaddition<br>
step may result in mixtures of regioisomers. As will be apparent to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, these mixtures can be separated by well-known separation techniques,<br>
e.g, chromatography, recrystallization, and the like, to obtain the desired regioisomer.<br>
Various acid addition salts of the compound of the formula IX can be prepared by<br>
treatment with an organic or inorganic acid. Preferably, the acid addition salts formed<br>
are pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as those described in United States Patent No.<br>
5,563,165, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Suitable base<br>
addition salts of the compound of formula I, wherein the phenyl group at the 5-position<br>
of the pyrazole ring incorporates a carboxy or hydroxyl substituent. Base addition salts<br>
include metallic addition salts, e.g, sodium, potassium, and organic base addition salts,<br>
e.g, organic amines. Other pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are detailed in<br>
United States Patent No. 5,563,165.<br><br>
Preparation of Alkenes of the Formula X (General Methods)<br>
The alkene of the formula X<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, trihalomethyl or a group of the formula II can be<br>
prepared by a number of processes known in the art. For example, a Wittig reaction can<br>
be conducted with a substituted phenyl aldehyde of the formula XI<br>
Y-CHO PQ),<br>
wherein Y is as described above, and a compound of the formula XIII<br>
Ph3P-CHR1 (XIII)<br>
to give the alkene of the formula X. The compound of the formula XIII can be generated<br>
from the corresponding phosphonium salt<br>
Ph3P-CH2R1 + I- (or Br-)<br>
by reaction with a strong base, e.g., n-butyllithium, in a suitable organic solvent, e.g.,<br>
diethyl ether. The phosphonium salts, in turn, are either readily commercially available<br>
(e.g., Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI), or can be generated from the<br>
corresponding alkyl iodides or bromides by reaction with triphenylphosphine.<br>
i<br>
Preparation of Alkenes of the Formula X (wherein R1 is C1-C6 alkyl)<br>
In addition to Wittig-type condensations, additional procedures are also useful for<br>
the preparation of certain alkenes of the formula X, wherein R1 is C1-C6 alkyl. For<br>
example, a Knoevenagel-type condensation of an aldehyde of the formula XI<br>
Y-CHO (XI)<br>
with nitromethane yields a nitroalkene of the formula XII<br><br>
(as described in Liu et al. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2001, 42, 6147-6150). Typically, the<br>
condensation is conducted in acetic acid with added ammonium acetate at between about<br>
75-118 °C from about 3 hours to about 24 hours. The resulting nitroalkene is then<br>
treated with at least 3 molar equivalents of triethylborane (preferably about 4<br>
equivalents) to give the alkene of the formula X wherein R1 is ethyl. To prepare alkenes<br>
of the formula X, wherein R1 is other than ethyl, the corresponding alkyl iodide (i.e., R1-<br><br>
1,6-20 equivalents) can be added to the reaction mixture in addition to triethylborane.<br>
The reaction of the nitroalkene with triethylborane or triethylborane / alkyl iodide is<br>
conveniently conducted, for example, as a one-pot process by addition of diethyl ether<br>
and water to the Knoevenagel condensation reaction mixture. Alternatively, the<br>
intermediate nitroalkene can be isolated, and then subjected to the alkylation procedure<br>
in an ethereal solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at about room temperature (Liu et al. J. Org.<br>
Chem. 2001, 42, 6147-6150).<br>
Preparation of Alkenes of the Formula X (wherein R1 is a Group of the Formula II)<br>
In another embodiment, a procedure for preparing an alkene of the formula X,<br>
wherein R1 is a group of the formula II<br><br>
is provided. In the procedure a substituted phenyl aldehyde of the formula XI<br>
Y-CHO (XI),	<br>
wherein Y is as described above, is condensed with a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl<br>
acetic acid of the formula XVII<br><br>
In one typical procedure, the condensation reaction is conducted using a base, e.g.,<br>
piperidine, without added solvent. Alternatively, the condensation can be conducted in<br>
acetic anhydride using triethylamine. The reaction temperatures for the condensations<br>
are about 120 °C to about 140 °C from about 8 to about 12 hours.<br>
Preparation of Alkenes of the Formula X (wherein R1 is Trifluoromethyl)<br><br>
Another procedure provides a method for preparing an alkene of the formula X,<br>
wherein R1 is trifluoromethyl. In this procedure, an alkyne of the formula VII<br><br>
is treated with iodine (about 1 to 1.8 equivalents) to form a diiodo alkene of the formula<br><br>
The diiodo compound of the formula XIV is then reacted with a slight molar<br>
excess of a reagent of the formula<br>
FSO2CF2CO2CH3<br>
in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper iodide in a suitable organic solvent, e.g.,<br>
dimethylformamide, at 60 to about 100 °C, preferably about 75 to 80 °C to give an iodo-<br>
trifluoromethyl substituted alkene intermediate XVI<br>
1<br>
  1<br>
The trifluoromethylating reagent can be prepared according to procedures described in<br>
Wiamers et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986,108, 832. The intermediate XVI can then be<br>
reduced using, for example, about 3 to about 4 equivalents of zinc, a catalytic amount of<br>
silver acetate and acetic acid in dimethylformamide at 15 to about 35 °C for about 1 to<br>
about 24 hours. After water workup, the alkene of the formula Xa<br><br>
is isolated, for example, by distillation or chromatography. This procedure is<br>
exemplified in Duan et al., J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 9486-9489.<br>
Alternatively, an alkene of the formula Xa can be obtained through controlled<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of the alkyne of the formula IVb (prepared as described above)<br><br>
using, for example, a selective hydrogenation catalyst, e.g., Lindlar's catalyst, a nickel-<br>
boride catalyst, to give the alkene in a suitable inert organic solvent, e.g, ethanol.<br><br>
Preparation of N-[[5-Substituted-3-phenvlisoxal-4-yl)phenyl]sulfonvl]alkanamide and<br>
N-[[5-Substituted-3-phenvl-2-isoxalin-4-yl]phenyl]sultbnyl]alkanamides and their Salts<br>
(Compounds of the Formula Ib. Ib'. IXb and IXb'<br>
In another aspect the invention relates to a method of preparing a compound of<br>
the formula Ib <br>
wherein R1 and R5 are as described above and R6 is C1-C5 alkyl, and their corresponding<br>
base addition salts (formed from the deprotonation of the alkanamide moieties). The<br>
process for preparing for the compounds includes the step of preparing the compounds of<br>
the formulas la and IXa using the [3+2] cycloaddition process described above for the<br>
preparation of the compounds of the formula I and IX. The preparation of the isoxazole<br>
compound of the formula Ib and its corresponding base addition salt is shown in Scheme<br>
3. Preferred base addition salts include alkali metal salts (wherein M+ is an alkali metal<br>
cation selected from sodium, potassium and lithium, preferably sodium in Scheme 3)<br><br><br>
After the cycloaddition step, the sulfonamide moiety of the compound of the formula la<br>
is acylated with an acylating agent of the formula XIX, wherein R6 is C1-C5 alkyl,<br>
preferably C1-C3 alkyl, in the presence of a trialkylamine base, e.g. triethylamine, to give<br>
the compound of the formula Ib. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that<br>
alternative acylating reagents can be used for the acylation including acid chlorides,<br>
activated esters, and the like. The corresponding alkali metal salt Ib' can be prepared by<br>
treatment of the compound of the formula Ib with an alkali metal base, e.g., an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide of the formula<br>
M+ OH-,<br>
wherein M+ is an alkali metal cation, preferably sodium cation. Typically the base<br>
treatment is performed using aqueous hydroxide solution.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of the formula Ib can be prepared by preparing an<br>
alkyne of the formula IVd,<br><br><br>
having a sulfonamido moiety already in place, and treating the alkyne with a nitrile oxide<br>
in a [3+2] cycloaddition as described above.<br>
The isoxazoline compound of the formula IXb and its corresponding basic<br>
addition salt can be formed using an analogous synthetic route as depicted in Scheme 4.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
E A<br>
Alternatively, the compound of the formula IXb can be prepared by preparing an<br>
alkene of the formula Xd,<br>
i <br>
having a sulfonamido moiety already in place, and treating the alkene with a nitrile oxide<br>
in a [3+2] cycloaddition as described above.<br>
In embodiments of the above processes wherein the substituted or unsubstituted<br>
i phenyl group Y, the aryl group Z, or a group of the formula II<br><br><br>
bear substituents such as hydroxyl or carboxy that may interfere or decrease the yield of<br>
certain synthetic steps, suitable protecting groups for these substituents that are well<br>
known in the art, can be used. The protecting groups can be then removed at appropriate<br>
points in the synthetic sequence by known methods. Thus, for example, a hydroxyl<br>
moiety can be protected as a methyl or silyl ether. Similarly, a carboxy moiety can be<br>
protected as an ester if necessary, which can be hydrolyzed in a later synthetic step.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but of course,<br>
should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of 3-(4-ChlorophenylV4-Phenyl Isoxazole (Compound of the<br>
Formula I wherein R1=H. Y=4-phenvl and Z=4-chlorophenvl).<br><br>
A solution of phenylacetylene (10 mmol), 4-chlorobenzaldoxime (10 mmol) and<br>
chloramine-T (10 mmol, N-chloro-p-toluenesulfoneamide, sodium salt) were dissolved<br>
in methanol (40 mL) and refluxed for 6 h. The contents of the flask were cooled and the<br>
precipitated material, which was a mixture of isoxazole and 4 -toluenesulfonamide, was<br>
filtered and washed with water. The solid material on boiling in hot water kept the<br>
sulfonamide in solution while precipitating the isoxazole. The precipitated isoxazole<br>
was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol, yield (82%), m.p.: 178-180 °C; 1H NMR<br>
(DMSO-d6) 6.75(s, 1H), 7.49-7.55(m, 5H), 7.77-7.82 (m, 4H).<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of 4-[5-methvl-3-phenvl-isoxazol-l-vl1benzenesulfonamide<br>
(Compound of the Formula I wherein R1=CH3,Y=4-sulfamvlphenyl and Z=phenyl).<br><br><br>
Preparation of 4-sulfamyl acetophenone (Va):<br><br>
To a solution of 4-acetylbenzene sulfonyl chloride (XV, 10 mmol) in ether (120<br>
mL), ammonium hydroxide (4 mL) is added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 h,<br>
the solvent is removed, and the residue is stirred with 3 N HC1 (100 mL) for 1 h and<br>
filtered. The solid obtained is washed with water, ether, and then dried under reduced<br>
pressure. The 4-sulfamyl acetophenone obtained is used in the next step without further<br>
purification.<br>
Preparation of l-(4-sulfamvlphenyl)-1-Propvne (Alkvne of the Formula IV. wherein Y is<br>
4-sulfamylphenyl and R1 is methyl. R2=NH2):<br><br>
A solution of lithium diisopropylamide (5.25 mmol) in THF is charged to a dry<br>
two-necked flask flushed with nitrogen maintained at 0 °C. To this solution, 4-<br>
sulfamylacetophenone (Va, 5 mmol) is added dropwise to the stirred solution with<br>
constant bubbling of the solution with dry nitrogen. The reaction mixture is stirred for<br>
30 min at 0 °C, followed by the addition of diethyl chlorophosphate (5.75 mmol).<br>
A cooled solution of lithium diisopropylamide (12.5 mmol) is added to the stirred<br>
reaction mixture via syringe. To this reaction mixture 3 mL of<br>
hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) is added, and the reaction mixture is warmed to 5<br>
°C followed by the addition of 2.5 mL (37.5 mmol) of iodomethane. At this point, the<br>
nitrogen inlet tube is replaced with a reflux condenser. The reaction mixture is refluxed<br>
for 1 h, followed by the addition of 10 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution.<br>
After 5 minutes of stirring, 20 mL of ether is added. The mixture is shaken, and the ether<br>
layer is separated and evaporated to give l-(4-sulfamylphenyl)-l-propyne.<br><br>
Preparation of 4-f5-methyl-3-phenyl-isoxazol-l-yl]benzenesulfonamide:<br>
A solution of benzaldehyde oxime (5 mmol) in methanol (15 mL) is heated to<br>
30-40 °C. Chloramine-T (5 mmol) is then added and the contents are heated to reflux.<br>
The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue obtained is extracted with<br>
dichloromethane (100 mL), washed with 1 M NaOH, brine and then dried. Removal of<br>
the dichloromethane under reduced pressure yields the nitrile oxide. The nitrile oxide (5<br>
i<br>
mmol) is added to l-(4-sulfamylphenyl)-l-propyne (5 mmol) in ethanol (50 mL) and the<br>
resulting mixture is refluxed for 3 h. The cooled reaction mixture is filtered, washed<br>
with brine and water. Concentration under reduced pressure gives 4-[5-methyl-3-phenyl-<br>
isoxazol-1 -yl]benzenesulfonamide.<br>

added a solution of S-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-4-fluorophenyl-3-nitrophenylsulfonium<br>
triflate (12 mmol) in THF (10 ml). The resulting mixture is stirred under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere for 5 h. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the product is<br>
purified by column chromatography.<br>
Example 4 - Preparation of 2-Isoxazolines (Compounds of the Formula IX).<br><br>
(5 mmol) in methanol (15 ml) is heated to 30-40 °C. Chloramine-T (1.45 g, 5 mmol) is<br>
then added, and the contents are heated to reflux. The solvent is removed in vacuo and<br>
the residue obtained is extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL), washed with 1M<br><br>
NaOH, brine and then dried. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure yields the<br>
nitrile oxide. The nitrile oxide (5 mmol) is added to the alkene of the formula X<br><br>
(5 mmol) in ethanol (50 ml), and the resulting mixture is refluxed for 3 h. Diethyl ether<br>
is added to the cooled reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is washed with brine and<br>
water. Concentration under reduced pressure gives the compound of the formula IX.<br>
The product can be further purified by recrystallization from suitable recrystallization<br>
solvents, e.g., methanol.<br>
Example 5: Cvclooxvgenase Inhibitory Assay<br>
Cyclooxygenase activity of ovine COX-1 (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc.) and<br>
human recombinant COX-2 (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc.) are assayed by a thin<br>
layer chromatography (TLC) method as follows. All inhibitors are dissolved in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide to a stock solution of 5mM. Human recombinant COX-2 (3 units) or ovine<br>
COX-1 (15 units) is incubated with inhibitors at several concentrations in a solution<br>
containing 100 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, 500 uM phenol and hematin for 90 to 120 minutes<br>
at room temperature (24°C). In controls, equal volumes of DMSO without drug are<br>
added to the incubation mixture. After incubation for 90-120 minutes, [1-14C]<br>
arachidonic acid (50uM, 51mCi/mmol) (DuPont NEN) is added and incubated at 37 °C<br>
for 2 minutes. The reaction is terminated by extraction with 1 mL of ethyl acetate. The<br>
ethyl acetate layer is transferred into a fresh tube and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum<br>
dryer. The contents of the tubes are reconstituted in 20 mL of ethyl acetate, spotted on a<br>
TLC plate (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and developed in a mobile phase containing<br>
chloroform/methanol (95:5) at 4°C. Radiolabeled prostanoid compounds (the products<br>
of COX enzymatic reaction with radiolabeled arachidonic acid substrate) are quantitated<br>
with a radioactivity scanner (Fuji, Phosphorimager). The percentage of total products<br>
observed at different inhibitor concentrations is divided by the percentage of the products<br>
observed for protein samples pre incubated for the same time with DMSO.<br><br>
Example 6: Soft Agar Assay<br>
Compounds of the formula IX are assayed for inhibition of growth of DLD-1<br>
cells in soft agar. DLD1 cells are human colorectal carcinoma cells that overexpress<br>
COX-2. DLD-1 cells grow in soft agar and form tumors in nude mice. The soft agar<br>
assay is performed as follows. A layer of bottom agar (8% noble agar) is placed onto 60<br>
mm2 tissue culture dishes. The tumor cells are trypsinized from normal growth flasks<br>
while in exponential growth. The cells are counted by using a hemacytometer and 1.0 x<br>
105 cells are placed into the top agar mixture containing growth medium, 4% noble agar<br>
and various concentrations of drugs. The concentration range is normally between 10<br>
M to 75 M. The cells are not refed during the assay system; therefore, the cells are<br>
treated with one dose of the agents. The plates are stained 20 days later with a 0.05%<br>
(w/v) nitroblue tetrazolium solution (which stains only viable cells) for 48 hours. A<br>
comparison of the percent of cell colonies remaining in the drug treated cells is made<br>
relative to the untreated cells.<br>
