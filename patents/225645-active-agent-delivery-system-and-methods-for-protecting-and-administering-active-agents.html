BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(i) Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The present invention relates to active agent delivery systems and,<br>
more specifically, to compositions that comprise peptides covalently attached to active agents and methods for administering conjugated active agent compositions.<br>
(ii) Background of the Invention<br>
[003] Active agent delivery systems are often critical for the safe effective<br>
administration of a biologically active agent (active agent). Perhaps the importance of these systems is best realized when patient compliance and consistent dosing are taken under consideration. For instance, reducing the dosing requirement for a drug from four-times-a-day (QID) to a single dose per day would have significant value in terms of ensuring patient compliance. Increasing the stability of the active agent, will assure dosage reproducibility and perhaps may also reduce the number of dosages required. Furthermore, any benefit that modulated absorption can confer on an existing drug would certainly improve the safety of the drug. Finally, improving the absorption of drugs should have a significant impact on the safety and efficacy of the drug.<br>
£004] Absorption of an orally administered active agent is often blocked by<br>
the harshly acidic stomach milieu, powerful digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lack of the agent's permeability and transport across lipid bilayers. These systems respond, in part, to the physicochemical properties of the drug molecule itself. Physical constants describing specific physicochemical properties like lipophilicity (log P) and ionizability (pKa) depend on molecular structure of the active agent. Some drugs are poorly absorbed because they are too hydrophilic and do not effectively cross the plasma membranes of cells. Others are too lipophilic and are insoluble in the intestinal lumen and cannot migrate to the mucosa lining. The entire digestion and absorption process is a complex sequence of events, some of which are closely interdependent. There should exist optimum physicochemical properties by which active agent bioavailability is maximized. However, it is often difficult to optimize these properties without losing therapeutic efficacy. [005] Optimization of a drug's bioavailability has many potential benefits.<br>
For patient convenience and enhanced compliance it is generally recognized that less frequent dosing is desirable. By extending the period through which the drug is absorbed, a longer duration of action per dose is expected. This will then lead to an overall improvement of dosing parameters such as taking a drug twice a day where it has previously required four times a day dosing. Many drugs are presently given at a once a day dosing frequency. Yet, not all of these drugs have pharmacokinetic properties that are suitable for dosing intervals of exactly twenty-four hours. Extending the period through which these drugs are absorbed would also be beneficial.<br>
[006] One of the fundamental considerations in drug therapy involves the<br>
relationship between blood levels and therapeutic activity. For most drugs, it is of primary importance that serum levels remain between a minimally effective concentration and a potentially toxic level, m pharmacokinetic terms, the peaks and troughs of a drug's blood levels ideally fit well within the therapeutic window of serum concentrations. For certain therapeutic agents, this window is so narrow that dosage formulation becomes critical. Such is the case with the drug, digoxin, which is used to treat heart failure.<br>
[007] Digoxin therapeutic blood levels include the range between 0.8<br>
ng/mL (below which the desired effects may not be observed) and about 2 ng/mL (above which toxicity may occur). Among adults in whom clinical toxicity has been observed, two thirds have serum concentrations greater than 2 ng/mL. Furthermore, adverse reactions can increase dramatically with small increases above this maximum level. For example, digoxin-induced arrhythmias occur at 10%, 50%, and 90% incidences at serum drug levels of 1.7, 2.5 and 3.3 ng/mL, respectively. [008] After the oral administration of digoxin, an effect will usually be<br>
evident in 1-2 hours with peak effects being observed between 4 and 6 hours. After a sufficient time, the concentration in plasma and the total body store is dependent on the single daily maintenance dose. It is critical that this dose be individualized for each patient. Having a dosage form of digoxin that provides a more consistent serum level between doses is therefore useful.<br>
[009] Another example of the benefit of more consistent dosing is provided<br>
by the 6-blocker atenolol. The duration of effects for this commonly used drug is usually assumed to be 24 hours. However, at the normal dose range of 25-100 mg given once a day, the effect may wear off hours before the next dose begins acting. For patients being treated for angina, hypertension, or for the prevention of a heart attack, this may be particularly risky. One alternative is to give a larger dose than is necessary in order to get the desired level of action when the serum levels are the lowest. But this may cause side effects related to excessive concentrations in the initial hours of the dosing interval. At these higher levels, atenolol loses its potential advantages. 6-1 selectivity and adverse reactions related to the blockade of 6-2 receptors become more significant.<br>
[010] In the case of anti-HIV nucleoside drugs, metering the absorption of<br>
the drug into the bloodstream has sufficient benefit. Drugs like AZT, for example, depend on phosphorylation to occur after absorption and before uptake into a virus in order to be effective. In normal dosing, drug levels increase rapidly after absorption that the phosphorylation reaction pathways can become saturated. Furthermore, the rate of phosphorylation is dependent on serum concentrations. The reactions occur more rapidly when concentrations are lower. Therefore, nucleoside<br>
analogs which retain lower serum concentrations are more efficiently converted to active drugs than other rapidly absorbed anti-viral drugs.<br>
[01l] Whereas the toxicity of digoxin and atenolol can be viewed as<br>
extensions of their desired activities, toxicity associated with the statins, on the other hand, is seemingly unrelated to the therapeutic effect of the drug. The toxic side effects of statins include, amongst other things, liver problems and rhabdomyolysis. Although the exact cause of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis and liver toxicity is not well understood, they have been linked to potent liver enzymes. The therapeutic effect of the statins is a result of the down-regulation of one of the key enzymes responsible for cholesterol production. Statin overdosing, however, can cause the reduced synthesis of non-sterol products that are important for cell growth, in addition to rhabdomyolysis. So with the statins, a case can be made that by modulating the absorption of the drug, the therapeutic effect can be obtained at lower doses thereby minimizing the risk of producing toxic side effects. [012] Finally, increasing the absorption of an active agent can have a<br>
significant impact on its safety. Taking the example of statins, once more, statins are anywhere between 10 and 30% absorbed and dosing is based on the average of this range so for patients that absorb 30% of the statins administered, deleterious side effects can occur. The risk of manifesting these side effects would be greatly diminished if the bioavailability of the drug were more predictable. [013] In an attempt to address the need for improved bioavailability several<br>
drug release modulation technologies have been developed. Enteric coatings have been used as a protector of Pharmaceuticals in the stomach and microencapsulating active agents using protenoid microspheres, liposomes or polysaccharides have been effective in abating enzyme degradation of the active agent. Enzyme inhibiting adjuvants have also been used to prevent enzyme degradation. [014] A wide range of pharmaceutical formulations purportedly provides<br>
sustained release through microencapsulation of the active agent in amides of dicarboxylic acids, modified amino acids or thermally condensed amino acids. Slow release rendering additives can also be intermixed with a large array of active agents in tablet formulations. For example, formulating diazepam with a copolymer of<br>
' glutamic acid and aspartic acid enables a sustained release of the active agent. As another example, copolymers of lactic acid and glutaric acid are used to provide timed release of human growth hormone. The microencapsulation of therapeutics and diagnostic agents is generally described for example in U.S. 5,238,714 to Wallace et al.<br>
[015] While microencapsulation and enteric coating technologies impart<br>
enhanced stability and time-release properties to active agent substances these technologies suffer from several shortcomings. Incorporation of the active agent is often dependent on diffusion into the microencapsulating matrix, which may not be quantitative and may complicate dosage reproducibility. In addition, encapsulated drugs rely on diffusion out of the matrix or degradation of the matrix, which is highly dependant on the water solubility of the active agent. Conversely, water-soluble microspheres swell by an infinite degree and, unfortunately, may release the active agent in bursts with little active agent available for sustained release. Furthermore, in some technologies, control of the degradation process required for active agent release is unreliable. For example, an enterically coated active agent depends on pH to release the active agent and, as such, is difficult to control the rate of release.<br>
[016] Active agents have been covalently attached to the amino acid side<br>
chains of polypeptides as pendant groups. These technologies typically require the use of spacer groups between the amino acid pendant group and the active agent. An example of a timed and targeted release pharmaceutical administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, or intra-arterially includes the linking of nitrogen mustard, via a stabilizing peptide spacer, to a macromolecular carrier, e.g. poly-[N5-(2-hydroxylethyl)-L-glutamine] (PHEG) which has an improved half-life when attached to the carrier and stabilizing unit.<br>
[017] Dexamethasone has been covalently attached directly to the beta<br>
carboxylate of polyaspartic acid as a colon-specific drug delivery system, which is released by bacterial hydrolytic enzymes residing in the large intestines. The dexamethasone active agent was targeted to treat large bowel disorders and was not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Other examples include techniques<br>
for forming peptide-linked biotin, peptide-linked acridine, naphthylacetic acid bonds to LH-RH, and coumarinic acid cyclic bonds to opioid peptides. [018] Several implantable drug delivery systems have utilized polypeptide<br>
attachment to drugs. An example includes the linking of norethindrone, via a hydroxypropyl spacer, to the gamma carboxylate of a large polyglutamic acid polymeric carrier designed to biodegrade over long periods of time after implantation via injection or surgical procedures. Additionally, other large polymeric carriers incorporating drugs into their matrices are used as implants for the gradual release of drug. Examples of implant delivery systems are generally described in U.S. 4,356,166 to Peterson et al. and 4,976,962 to Bichon et al. Yet another technology combines the advantages of covalent drug attachment with liposome formation where the active ingredient is attached to highly ordered lipid films (known as HARs) via a peptide linker. Further description can be found in WO 97/36616 and U.S. 5,851,536 to Yager et al.<br>
[019] Other systems were designed for the delivery of cytotoxic agents with<br>
specific amino acid sequences so that the drug will not be cleaved until the conjugate comes into contact with specific enzymes or receptors. One such example is the binding of oligopeptides directed toward enzymatically active prostrate specific antigen (PSA), to a cytotoxic agent which also typically contains a protecting group to prevent premature release of die conjugate in the blood. Another system designed for delivery via injection relies on specific peptides directly linked to a polymeric carrier, which is, in turn, attached to the cytotoxic moiety to be internalized by the cell. In this case, the polymeric carrier, typically large, will not enter cells lacking receptors for the specific peptide attached. In another example, gastrin receptor directed tetragastrin and pentagastrin amides were attached to cytotoxic drug for testing in vitro. These systems are generally described in U.S. 5,948,750 to Garsky et al.; U.S. 5,087,616 Myers et al.; and Schmidt et al., Peptide Linked l,3-Dialkyl-3-acyltriazenes: Garstrin Receptor Directed Antineoplastic Alkylating Agents, Journal of Medical Chemistry, Vol. 37, No. 22, pp. 3812-17 (1994).<br>
[020] Several systems have been directed to the treatment of tumor cells.<br>
In one case, Daunorubicin bound poly-L-aspartic acid, delivered intravenously or intraperitoneally, demonstrated lower cytotoxic effect. In another example, Daunorubicin was covalently attached via a methylketone side-chain of the drug to both poly-L-aspartic acid and poly-L-lysine The conjugates were prepared for intravenous and intraperitoneal administration. The poly-L-lysine was found to be ineffective, while the poly-L-aspartic acid conjugate showed preferential tumor cell uptake. In another system, a highly substituted polypetide conjugated to the active agent was designed for introduction into blood vessels that further penetrated the interstitium of tumors through long chain lengths. Further discussion of delivery systems targeted at tumor cells are described in Zunino et al., Comparison of Antitumor Effects of Daunorubicin Covalently Linked to Poly-L-Amino Acid Carriers, Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol, Vol. 20, No. 3, pp. 421-425 (1984); Zunino et al., Anti-tumor Activity of Daunorubicin Linked to Poly-L-Aspartic Acid, Int. J. Cancer, 465-470 (1982); and 5,762,909 to Uzgiris.<br>
[021] Several examples relate to the delivery of paclitaxel, an anti-cancer<br>
drug. One delivery system relies on the drug remaining attached to the conjugate for transport into the cell via a membrane transport system. In another example, the paclitaxel is conjugated to a high molecular weight polyglutamic acid, and was delivered via injection. Paclitaxel conjugates have also been used with implants, coatings and injectables. These systems are further described in U.S. Patent 6,306,993; Li et al. Complete Regression of Well-established Tumors Using a Novel Water-soluble Poly(L-Glutamic Acid)-Paclitaxel Conjugate, pp. 2404-2409; and U.S. 5,977,163 to Li et al.<br>
[022] Delivery systems can be designed to utilize attachment to chemical<br>
moieties that are either specifically recognized by a specialized transporters or have enhanced adsorption into target cells through specific polypeptide sequence. There are seven known intestinal transport systems classified according to the physical properties of the transported substrate. They include the amino acid, oligopeptide, glucose, monocarboxic acid, phosphate, bile acid and the P-glycoprotein transport systems and each has its own associated mechanism of transport. Evidence suggests<br>
-that hydrophilic compounds are absorbed through the intestinal epithelia more efficiently through these specialized transporters than by passive diffusion. Active transport mechanisms can depend on hydrogen ions, sodium ions, binding sites or other cofactors. Facilitation of these transporters can also depend on some sort of specialized adjuvant, which can result in localized delivery of an active agent, increased absorption of the active agent or some combination of both. Incorporating adjuvants such as resorcinol, surfactants, polyethylene glycol (PEG) or bile acids enhance permeability of cellular membranes. Increased bioavailability was found when peptides were bound to modified bile acids. Kramer et al., Intestinal Absorption of Peptides by Coupling to Bile Acids, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 269, No. 14, pp. 10621-627 (1994). The use of specific polypeptide sequences to increase absorption is discussed in the literature where attaching the drug to a polypeptide chain enhances the drug's permeability into cells. For example, Paul Wender of Stanford University reported the use of polyarginine tags on cyclosporine and taxol to facilitate diffusion across cell membranes. The penetratin system provides another example. This class of peptides, about 16 residues long, was shown to enhance absorption of oligonucleotides and polypeptides.<br>
[023] It is also important to control the molecular weight, molecular size<br>
and particle size of the active agent delivery system. Variable molecular weights have unpredictable diffusion rates and pharmacokinetics. High molecular weight carriers are digested slowly or late, as in the case of naproxen-linked dextran, which is digested almost exclusively in the colon by bacterial enzymes. High molecular weight microspheres usually have high moisture content which may present a problem with water labile active ingredients. Due to the inherent instability of non-covalent bonds, the bond between the active agent and the microsphere will usually not withstand the vigorous conditions used to reduce the composition's particle size. [024] Thus, there has been no pharmaceutical composition, heretofore<br>
reported, that incorporates the concept of attaching an active agent to a peptide or its pendant group with targeted delivery of the active agent into the general systemic circulation. Furthermore, there has been no pharmaceutical composition that teaches<br>
" fiie release of the active agent from the peptide by enzymatic action in the gastro intestinal tract.<br>
[025] The need still exists for an active agent delivery system that does not<br>
require that the active agent be released within specific cells (e.g. a tumor-promoting cell), but rather results in release of the active agent for general systemic delivery. [026] The need further exists for an active agent delivery system that allows<br>
for the oral delivery of active agents that will survive in the stomach and allow for the release of the reference active agent in the small intestines, the brush border membrane, in the intestinal epithelial cells or by enzymes in the bloodstream. The present invention also addresses the need for an active agent delivery system that is able to deliver active agents as an active agent peptide conjugate so that the molecular mass and physiochemical properties of the conjugate can be readily manipulated to achieve the desired release rate. The need still exists for an active agent delivery system that allows for the active agent to be released over a sustained period of time, which is convenient for patient dosing.<br>
[027] There is a generally recognized need to have an active agent delivery<br>
system that reduces the daily dosing requirement and allows for time released or controlled released absorption of the composition. The present invention accomplishes this by extending the period during which an active agent is absorbed, and providing a longer duration of action per dose than is currently expected. This leads to an overall improvement of dosing parameters such as, for example, taking an active agent twice a day where it has previously required four times a day dosing. Alternatively, many active agents presently given at a once a day dosing frequency lack the pharmacokinetic properties suitable for dosing intervals of exactly, twelve or twenty-four hours. An extended period of active agent adsorption for the current single dose active agents still exists and would be beneficial. [028] Therefore, the need still exists for a drug delivery system that enables<br>
the use of new molecular compositions, which can reduce the technical, regulatory, and financial risks associated with active agents while improving the performance of the active agent in terms of its absorption parameters, as described above, and stability. Further, the need exists for an active agent delivery system targeted to<br>
general systemic circulation wherein the release of the drug from the peptide can occur by enzymatic action on the peptide-drug conjugate in the bloodstream or by enzymatic action on the peptide-drug conjugate in the alimentary tract followed by absorption through the intestines or stomach.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[029] The present invention provides covalent attachment of active agents<br>
to a peptide. The invention may be distinguished from the above mentioned technologies by virtue of covalently attaching the active agent directly, which includes, for example, pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients, to the N-terminus, the C-terminus or to the side chain of an amino acid, an oligopeptide or a polypeptide, also referred to herein as a carrier peptide. In another embodiment, when the active agent is itself an amino acid active agent, then the active agent may be part of the chain at either the C-terminus or N-terminus through a peptide bond, or interspersed in the polypeptide via peptide bonds on both sides of the active agent. [030] In another embodiment, the peptide stabilizes the active agent,<br>
primarily in the stomach, through conformational protection. In this application, delivery of the active agent is controlled, in part, by the kinetics of unfolding of the carrier peptide. Upon entry into the upper intestinal tract, endigenous enzymes release the active ingredient for absorption by the body by hydrolyzing the peptide bonds of the carrier peptide. This enzymatic action introduces the second phase of the sustained release mechanism.<br>
[031] In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition<br>
comprising a peptide and an active agent covalently attached to the peptide. Preferably, the peptide is (i) an oligopeptide, (ii) a homopolymer of one of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iv) a homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (v) a heteropolymer of two or more synthetic amino acids or (vi) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
[032] The invention provides compositions comprising a carrier peptide<br>
and an active agent covalently attached to the carrier peptide. Preferably, the carrier peptide is (i) an amino acid, (ii) a dipeptide, (iii) a tripeptide, (iv) an oligopeptide, or (v) polypeptide. The carrier peptide may also be (i) a homopolymer of a naturally occurring amino acids, (ii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino acids, (iii) a homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (iv) a heteropolymer of two or more synthetic amino acids, or (v) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids. [033] A further embodiment of the carrier and/or conjugate is that the<br>
unattached portion of the carrier/conjugate is in a free and unprotected state. [034] In another embodiment, the invention further provides a composition<br>
comprising an amino acid, a dipeptide or a tripeptide with an active agent covalently attached. Preferably, the amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide are (i) one of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (ii) two or more naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iii) a synthetic amino acid, (iv) two or more synthetic amino acids or (v) one or more naturally occurring amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids. Preferably synthetic amino acids with alkyl side chains are selected from alkyls of C1-C17 in length and more preferably from C1-C6 in length.<br>
[035] In one embodiment the active agent conjugate is attached to a single<br>
amino acid which is either naturally occurring or a synthetic amino acid. In another embodiment the active agent conjugate is attached to a dipeptide or tripeptide, which could be any combination of the naturally occurring amino acids and synthetic amino acids. In another embodiment the amino acids are selected from L-amino acids for digestion by proteases.<br>
[036] In another embodiment, the peptide carrier can be prepared using<br>
conventional techniques. A preferred technique is copolymerization of mixtures of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. In another embodiment, the peptide can be prepared through a fermentation process of recombinant microorganisms followed by harvesting and purification of the appropriate peptide. Alternatively, if a specific<br>
sequence of amino acids is desired, an automated peptide synthesizer can be used to produce a peptide with specific physicochemical properties for specific performance characteristics.<br>
[037] In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is an inorganic acid or a<br>
carboxylic acid and the carboxylate or the acid group is covalently attached to the N-terminus of the peptide. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is a sulfonamide or an amine and the amino group is covalently attached to the C-terminus of the peptide. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is an alcohol and the alcohol group is covalently attached to the C-terminus of the peptide.<br>
[038] In another embodiment, the active agent is itself an amino acid and is<br>
preferably covalently interspersed in the peptide in a peptide-linked manner or covalently attached to a side chain, the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the peptide. In this embodiment when the amino acid active agents are attached to the C-terminus or the N-terminus this results in the active agent being the end amino acid and is considered C-capped or N-capped, respectively.<br>
[039] The active agent can be covalently attached to the side chains of the<br>
polypeptide using conventional techniques. In a preferred embodiment a carboxylic acid containing active agent can be attached to the amine or alcohol group of the peptide side chain to form an amide or ester, respectively. In another preferred embodiment an amine containing active agent can be attached to the carboxylate, carbamide or guanine group of the side chain to form an amide or a new guanine group. In yet another embodiment of the invention, linkers can be selected from the group of all chemical classes of compounds such that virtually any side chain of the peptide can be attached.<br>
[040] In a preferred embodiment the side chain attachment of an active<br>
agent to the polypeptide the amino acids used in either homopolymers or heteropolymers are selected from glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, lysine, cysteine, threonine, asparagine, arginine, tyrosine, and glutamine. Preferred examples of peptides include, Leu-Ser, Leu-Glu, homopolymers of Glu and Leu, and heteropolymers of (Glu)n-Leu-Ser.<br>
[041] In another embodiment, direct attachment of an active agent to the<br>
carrier peptide may not form a stable compound therefore the incorporation of a linker between the active agent and the peptide is required. The linker should have a functional pendant group, such as a carboxylate, an alcohol, thiol, oxime, hydraxone, hydrazide, or an amine group, to covalently attach to the carrier peptide. In one preferred embodiment, the active agent is an alcohol and the alcohol group is covalently attached to the N-terminus of the peptide via a linker. In another preferred embodiment the active agent is a ketone or an aldehyde, which is attached to a linker through the formation of a ketal or acetal, respectively, and the linker has a pendant group that is attached to the carrier peptide. In yet another preferred embodiment the active agent is an amide, an imide, an imidazole or a urea where the nitrogen is attached to the linker and the pendant group of the linker is attached to the carrier peptide.<br>
[042] The invention also provides a method for preparing a composition<br>
comprising a peptide and an active agent covalently attached to the peptide. The method comprises the steps of:<br>
[043] (a) attaching the active agent to a side chain (and/or N-terminus<br>
and/or C-terminus) of an amino acid to form an active agent/amino acid complex; [044] (b) forming an amino acid complex N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) or<br>
forming an active agent/amino acid complex NCA from the active agent/amino acid complex; and<br>
[045] (c) polymerizing the active agent/amino acid complex N-<br>
carboxyanhydride (NCA).<br>
[046] In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is a pharmaceutical agent<br>
or an adjuvant. In another preferred embodiment, steps (a) and (b) are repeated with a second active agent prior to step (c). When steps (a) and (b) are repeated with a second agent prior to step (c), the active agent and second active agent can be copolymerized in step (c). Step (b) can include an amino acid (e.g. Glycine, Alanine, etc.), without an active agent attached, such that the product in step (c) is a copolymer of the active agent/amino acid complex and an amino acid interspersed in a peptide-linked manner.<br>
1047] In a further embodiment of the above method, the amino acid itself<br>
can be an active agent (e.g. Thyroxine or DOPA) such that combining the NCA of<br>
this bioactive amino acid NCA with other amino acid NCA's will produce a product<br>
in (c) of the bioactive amino acid interspersed in the peptide with the generic amino<br>
acid in a peptide-linked manner.<br>
[048] Alternatively, the active agent/amino acid complex can serve as a<br>
synthetic module for solid-phase or solution-phase peptide synthesis. Here, the drug<br>
can be attached to the selected amino acid by the a-amino group, the a-carboxylate<br>
or side chain functionality. Using these adducts in resin mounted peptide synthesis<br>
allows greater control of peptide composition, degree of loading, and relative<br>
positioning of the drug. Thus the uses of these modules represent a unique approach<br>
for incorporating specified drugs at specific locations within peptides.<br>
[049] Thus it is a further embodiment of this invention to expand the scope<br>
of current peptide synthesis technology to include novel amino acids derived from<br>
side-chain modified amino acids, hi addition, the N-terminus of an amino acid can<br>
be modified for N-capped drug-peptide conjugate. Similarly, the C-terminus of an<br>
amino acid can be derivatized with the drug to ultimately produce a C-capped<br>
peptide-drug conjugate.<br>
[050] The present invention provides for the synthesis whereby an active<br>
agent is conjugated to an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide or a<br>
polypeptide. Another embodiment of the present invention is dosage form reliability<br>
and batch-to-batch reproducibility.<br>
[051] In another embodiment the active agent delivery is targeted into<br>
general systemic circulation. The release of the active agent from the peptide can<br>
occur by enzymatic action on the peptide-active agent conjugate in the bloodstream<br>
or by enzymatic action on the peptide-active agent conjugate in the alimentary tract<br>
followed by absorption through the intestines or stomach by the regular route of<br>
entry.<br>
[052] In another embodiment, the invention also provides a method for<br>
delivering an active agent to a patient, the patient being a human or a non-human<br>
animal, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a peptide<br>
and an active agent covalently attached to the peptide. In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is released from the composition by enzyme catalysis. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is released in a time-dependent manner based on the pharmacokinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed release. [053] In another preferred embodiment, the generic amino acid is glutamic<br>
acid and the side chain attached active agent/glutamic acid complex is released from the peptide upon hydrolysis of the peptide and then the active agent is released from the glutamic acid by coincident intramolecular transamination. In another preferred embodiment, the glutamic acid is replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of aspartic acid, arginine, asparagine, cysteine, lysine, threonine, and serine, and wherein the active agent is attached to the side chain of the amino acid to form an amide, a thioester, an ester, an ether, a thioether, a carbonate, ah anhydride, an orthoester, a hydroxamic acid, a hydrazone, sulfonamide, sulfonic esters, other derivatives of sulfur, or a carbamate. In yet another preferred embodiment, the glutamic acid is replaced by a synthetic amino acid with a pendant group comprising an amine, an alcohol, a sulfhydryl, an amide, an urea, or an acid functionality. [054] The composition of the invention can also include one or more<br>
microencapsulating agents, adjuvants and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The active agent can be bound to the microencapsulating agent, the adjuvant or the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient through covalent, ionic, hydrophilic interactions or by some other non-covalent means. The microencapsulating agent can be selected from polyethylene glycol (PEG), amino acids, carbohydrates or salts. If it is desired to delay peptide digestion, the microencapsulating agents can be used to delay protein unfolding. In another embodiment, when an adjuvant is included in the composition, the adjuvant preferably imparts better absorption either through enhancing permeability of the intestinal or stomach membrane or activating an intestinal transporter.<br>
[055] The intestinal wall is coated with a mucosa lining made primarily of<br>
mucin. Many reagents have been identified that can bind to mucin. In another embodiment, the present invention provides the unique capability of binding a mucin-binding adjuvant to the peptide/drug conjugate to bioadhere the entire<br>
complex to the intestinal wall. The intestinal wall is impregnated with receptors for various reagents including many of the vitamins such as vitamin K. Binding vitamin K, for example, to the peptide-active agent conjugate will retain the entire complex in the intestines for a much longer time. It is the further embodiment of the invention wherein the adjuvant can bioadhere to the mucosal lining of the intestine thereby lengthening the transit time of the drug-peptide conjugate in the gut and maximizing peptide digestion and thus drug bioavailability.<br>
[056] In another preferred embodiment, the composition further comprises<br>
a microencapsulating agent and the active agent conjugate is released from the composition by swelling or dissolution of the microencapsulating agent followed by diffusion of the active agent conjugate which must then be acted upon by enzymes to release the active agent. In yet another preferred embodiment, the composition further comprises an adjuvant covalently attached to the peptide and release of the adjuvant from the composition is controlled by the enzymatic action on the peptide. The adjuvant can be microencapsulated into a carrier peptide-active agent conjugate for biphasic release of active agent. In another preferred embodiment, the peptide-active agent conjugate can be microencapsulated wherein the peptide-active agent conjugate is released in a biphasic manner, first through physicochemical means, such as through solvation or swelling, and then the active agent is released from the peptide carrier by enzymatic action. In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the active agent can be covalently attached to the microencapsulating agent via a peptide bond where the active agent is released first by peptidase action followed by migration of the active agent out of the microencapsulating medium. [057] It is another embodiment of the present invention that the active<br>
agents may be combined with peptides of varying amino acid content to impart specific physicochemical properties to the conjugate including, molecular weight, size, functional groups, pH sensitivity, solubility, three dimensional structure and digestibility in order to provide desired performance characteristics. Similarly, a variety of active agents may also be used with specific preferred peptides to impart specific performance characteristics. Significant advantages with respect to the stability, release and/or adsorption characteristics of the active agent that are<br>
imparted through the use of one or more of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids are manifest in the peptide physicochemical properties that impart specific stability, digestibility and release properties to the conjugates formed with active agents. [058] In another embodiment of the invention is the concept that the amino<br>
acids that make up the carrier peptide is a tool set such that the carrier peptide can conform to the pharmacological demand and the chemical structure of the active agent such that maximum stability and optimal performance of the composition are<br>
achieved.<br>
[059] In another preferred embodiment the amino acid chain length can be<br>
varied to suit different delivery criteria. For delivery with increased bioavailability, the active agent may be attached to a single amino acid to eight amino acids, with the range of two to five amino acids being preferred. For modulated delivery or increased bioavailability of active agents, the preferred length of the oligopeptide is between two and 50 amino acids in length. For conformational protection, extended digestion time and sustained release, preferred amino acid lengths may be between 8 and 400 amino acids. In another embodiment, the conjugates of the present invention are also suited for both large and small molecule active agents. In another embodiment of the present invention, the carrier peptide controls the solubility of the active agent-peptide conjugate and is not dependant on the solubility of the active agent. Therefore, the mechanism of sustained or zero-order kinetics afforded by the conjugate-drug composition avoids irregularities of release and cumbersome formulations encountered with typical dissolution controlled sustained release methods.<br>
[060] In another preferred embodiment, the active agent conjugates can<br>
incorporate adjuvants such that the compositions are designed to interact with specific receptors so that targeted delivery may be achieved. These compositions provide targeted delivery in all regions of the gut and at specific sites along the intestinal wall. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is released as the reference active agent from the peptide conjugate prior to entry into a target cell. In another preferred embodiment, the specific amino acid sequences used are not targeted to specific cell receptors or designed for recognition by a specific genetic<br>
sequence. In a more preferred embodiment, the peptide carrier is designed for recognition and/or is not recognized by tumor promoting cells. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent delivery system does not require that the active agent be released within a specific cell or intracellularly. In a preferred embodiment the carrier and/or the conjugate do result is specific recognition in the body. (e.g. by a cancer cell, by primers, for improving chemotactic activity, by sequence for a specific binding cite for serum proteins(e.g. kinins or eicosanoids). [061] In another embodiment the active agent may be attached to an<br>
adjuvant recognized and taken up by an active transporter. In a more preferred example the active transporter is not the bile acid active transporter. In another embodiment, the present invention does not require the attachment of the active agent to an adjuvant recognized and taken up by an active transporter for delivery. [062] While microsphere/capsules may be used in combination with the<br>
compositions of the invention, the compositions are preferably not incorporated with microspheres/capsules and do not require further additives to improve sustained release.<br>
[063] In another preferred embodiment the active agent is not a hormone,<br>
glutamine, methotrexate, daunorubicin, a trypsin-kallikrein inhibitor, insulin, calmodulin, calcitonin, naltrexone, L-dopa, interleukins, gonadoliberin, norethindrone, tolmetin, valacyclovir, taxol, a GABA analog, an L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, a catechol O-methyl transferase inhibitor, a naturally occurring amino acid, a bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine containing nitrogen mustard, a polypeptide, a peptidomimetic derived from a linear oligopeptide with greater the three amino acids, an oligonucleotide, a cyclophane derivative, a diehtylenetriaminopentaacetate derivative, histamine, a steroid or silver sulfadiazine. In a preferred embodiment wherein the active agent is a peptidic active agent it is preferred the active agent is unmodified (e.g. the amino acid structure is not substituted).<br>
[064] In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a carrier and active<br>
agent which are bound to each other but otherwise unmodified in structure. This embodiment may further be described as the carrier having a free carboxy and/or<br>
amine terminal and/or side chain groups other than the location of attachment for the<br>
active agent. In a more preferred embodiment the carrier, whether a single arnino<br>
acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, oligopeptide or polypeptide is comprises only naturally<br>
occurring arnino acids.<br>
[065] In a preferred embodiment the carrier is not a protein transporter (e.g.<br>
histone, insulin, transferrin, IGF, albumin or prolactin), Ala, Gly, Phe-Gly, or Phe-<br>
Phe. In a preferred embodiment the carrier is also preferably not a arnino acid<br>
copolymerized with a non-amino acid substitute such as PVP, a poly(alkylene oxide)<br>
arnino acid copolymer, or an alkyloxycarbonyl (polyaspartate/polyglutamate) or an<br>
aryloxycarbonylmethyl(poryaspartate/polyglutamate).<br>
[066] In a preferred embodiment neither the carrier or the conjugate are<br>
used for assay purification, binding studies or enzyme analysis.<br>
[067] In another embodiment, the carrier peptide allows for multiple active<br>
agents to be attached. The conjugates provide the added benefit of allowing<br>
multiple attachments not only of active agents, but of active agents in combination<br>
with other active agents, or other modified molecules which can further modify<br>
delivery, enhance release, targeted delivery, and/or enhance adsorption. In a further<br>
embodiment, the conjugates may also be combined with adjuvants or be<br>
microencapsulated.<br>
[068] In another embodiment the conjugates provide for a wide range of<br>
pharmaceutical applications including drug delivery, cell targeting, and enhanced<br>
biological responsiveness.<br>
[069] hi another embodiment, the invention can stabilize the active agent<br>
and prevent digestion in the stomach. In addition, the pharmacologic effect can be<br>
prolonged by delayed or sustained release of the active agent. The sustained release<br>
can occur by virtue of the active agent being covalently attached to the peptide<br>
and/or through the additional covalent attachment of an adjuvant that bioadheres to<br>
the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, active agents can be combined to produce<br>
synergistic effects. Also, absorption of the active agent in the intestinal tract can be<br>
enhanced either by virtue of being covalently attached to a peptide or through the<br>
synergistic effect of an added adjuvant.<br>
[070] In another preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention is<br>
in the form of an ingestible tablet or capsule, an intravenous preparation, an intramuscular preparation, a subcutaneous preparation, a depot implant, a transdermal preparation, an oral suspension, a sublingual preparation, an intranasal preparation, inhalers, or anal suppositories. In another embodiment, the peptide is capable of releasing the active agent from the composition in a pH-dependent manner. In another preferred embodiment the active agent is prepared and/or administered through means other than implantation and/or injectables. In a preferred embodiments the active agent conjugate is not bound to an immobilized carrier, rather it is designed for transport and transition through the digestive system. [071] Embodiments of the present invention preferably are not bound to an<br>
adjuvant recognized and/or taken up by active transporters. Preferably, the active agent conjugates of the present invention are not attached to active transporters, or antigenic agents such as receptor recognizing sequences found on cells and tumors. Preferably, the active agent conjugate of the present invention is not connected to or constitutes an implantable polymer, which would not biodegrade in less than 48 hours, preferably between 12 and 24 hours. The active agent conjugates of the present invention are preferably designed to release the active agent into the blood, after absorption from the gut, as the reference active agent.<br>
[072] In another embodiment, following administration of the active agent<br>
conjugate by a method other than oral, first pass metabolism is prevented, by avoiding recognition of liver oxidation enzymes due to its peptidic structure. [073] In another preferred embodiment the active agent is directly attached<br>
to the amino acid without the use of a linker.<br>
[074] The invention also provides a method for protecting an active agent<br>
from degradation comprising covalently attaching the active agent to a peptide such that the peptide will impart conformational protection to the active agent. [075] The invention also provides a method for controlling release of an<br>
active agent from a composition wherein the composition comprises a peptide, the method comprising covalently attaching the active agent to the peptide. It is a further embodiment of the invention that enhancement of the performance of active agents<br>
from a variety of chemical and therapeutic classes is accomplished by extending periods of sustained blood levels within the therapeutic window. For a drug where the standard formulation produces good bioavailability, the serum levels may peak too fast and too quickly for optimal clinical effect as illustrated below. Designing and synthesizing a specific peptide conjugate that releases the active agent upon digestion by intestinal enzymes mediates the release and absorption profile thus maintaining a comparable area under the curve while smoothing out active agent absorption over time.<br>
[076] Conjugate prodrugs may afford sustained or extended release to the<br>
parent compound. Sustained release typically refers to shifting absorption toward slow first-order kinetics. Extended release typically refers to providing zero-order kinetics to the absorption of the compound. Bioavailability may also be affected by factors other than the absorption rate, such as first pass metabolism by the enterocytes and liver, and clearance rate by the kidneys. Mechanisms involving these factors require that the drug-conjugate is intact following absorption. The mechanism for timed release may be due to any or all of a number of factors. These factors include: 1) gradual enzymatic release of the parent drug by luminal digestive<br>
enzymes, 2) gradual release by surface associated enzymes of the intestinal mucosa, 3) gradual release by intacellular enzymes of the intestinal mucosal cells, 4) gradual release by serum enzymes, 5) conversion of a passive mechanism of absorption to an active mechanism of uptake, making drug absorption dependent on the Km for receptor binding as well as receptor density, 6) decreasing the solubility of the parent drug resulting in more gradual dissolution 7) an increase in solubility resulting in a larger amount of drug dissolved and therefore absorption over a longer period of time due to the increased amount available.<br>
[077] The potential advantages of enzyme mediated release technology<br>
extend beyond the examples described above. For those active agents that can benefit from increased absorption, it is the embodiment of this invention that this effect is achieved by covalently bonding those active agents to one or more amino acids of the peptide and administering the drug to the patient as stated earlier. The invention also allows targeting to intestinal epithelial transport systems to facilitate absorption of active agents. Better bioavailability, in turn, may contribute to lower doses being needed. Thus it a further embodiment of the invention that by modulating the release and improving the bioavailability of an active agent in the manner described herein, reduced toxicity of the active agent can be achieved. [078] It is another embodiment of this invention that attachment of an<br>
amino acid, oligopepetide, or polypeptide may enhance absorption/bioavailability of the parent drug by any number of mechanisms, including conversion of the parent drug to a polymer-drug conjugate such that the amino acid-prodrugs may be taken up by amino acid receptors and/or di- and tri-peptide receptors (PEPT transporters). This may also hold true for polymer drug conjugates since by products of enzymatic activity in the intestine may generate prodrugs with 1-3 amino acids attached. Moreover, it is possible that other receptors may be active in binding and uptake of the prodrugs. Adding an additional mechanism(s) for drug absorption may improve its bioavailability, particularly if the additional mechanism is more efficient than the mechanism for absorption of the parent drug. Many drugs are absorbed by passive diffusion. Therefore, attaching an amino acid to the compound may convert the mechanism of absorption from passive to active or in some cases a combination of<br>
active and passive uptake, since the prodrug may be gradually converted to the parent drug by enzymatic activity in the gut lumen.<br>
[079] It is another embodiment of the invention that active agent efficiency<br>
is enhanced by lower active agent serum concentrations. It is yet another embodiment of the invention that conjugating a variety of active agents to a carrier peptide and, thereby sustaining the release and absorption of the active agent, would help achieve true once a day pharmacokinetics. In another embodiment of the invention, peaks and troughs can be ameliorated such as what could be achieved with more constant atenolol levels, for example, following administration of a peptide-atenolol conjugate.<br>
[080] In another embodiment of the present invention the amino acids used<br>
can make the conjugate more or less labile at certain pH's or temperatures depending on the delivery required. Further, in another embodiment, the selection of the amino acids will depend on the physical properties desired. For instance, if increase in bulk or lipophilicity is desired, then the carrier polypeptide will include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Polar amino acids, on the other hand, can be selected to increase the hydrophilicity of the peptide. In another embodiment, the amino acids with reactive side chains (e.g., glutamine, asparagines, glutamic acid, lysine, aspartic acid, serine, threonine and cysteine) can be incorporated for attachment points with multiple active agents or adjuvants to the same carrier peptide. This embodiment is particularly useful to provide a synergistic effect between two or more active agents. [081] In another embodiment, the peptides are hydrolyzed by any one of<br>
several aminopeptidases found in the intestinal lumen or associated with the brush-border membrane and so active agent release and subsequent absorption can occur in the jejunum or the ileum. In another embodiment, the molecular weight of the carrier molecule can be controlled to provide reliable, reproducible and/or increased active agent loading.<br>
[082] In another embodiment, the invention provides methods of testing the<br>
conjugates using Caco-2 cells.<br>
[083] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and<br>
the following detailed description are exemplary, but not restrictive, of the invention. These and other aspects of the invention as well as various advantages and utilities will be more apparent with reference to the detailed description of the preferred embodiments and in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[084] The present invention also addresses the need for non-protected<br>
active agents, which provide for ease of manufacture and delivery. The present invention also addresses the need for an active agent delivery system that is able to deliver active agents through the stomach as active agent peptide conjugates so that the molecular mass and physiochemical properties of the conjugates can be readily manipulated to achieve the desired release rate. The present invention also addresses the need for an active agent delivery system that allows for the active agent to be released over an extended period of time, which is convenient for patient dosing. The present invention also addresses the need for an active agent delivery system that will provide protection through the stomach, but not require that the active agent be released within a specific cell or intracellularly. [085] Embodiments of the present invention preferably do not produce an<br>
antigenic response or otherwise stimulate the immune system in the host. In another preferred embodiment the active agent conjugate attached to the carrier peptide is used to create an immune response when administered.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[091] Throughout this application the use of "peptide" is meant to include a<br>
single amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, a polypeptide, or the carrier peptide. Oligopeptide is meant to include from 2 amino acids to 70 amino acids. Further, at times the invention is described as being an active agent attached to an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, or polypeptide to illustrate specific embodiments for the active agent conjugate. Preferred lengths of the conjugates and other preferred embodiments are described herein. The [092] Modulation is meant to include at least the affecting of<br>
change, or otherwise changing total absorption, rate of adsorption and/or target delivery. Sustained release is at least meant to include an increase in the amount of reference drug in the blood stream for a period up to 36 hours following delivery of the carrier peptide active agent composition as compared to the reference drug delivered alone. Sustained release may further be defined as release of the active agent into systemic blood circulation over a prolonged period of time relative to the release of the active agent in conventional formulations through similar delivery routes.<br>
[093] The active agent is released from the composition by a pH-dependent<br>
unfolding of the carrier peptide or it is released from the composition by enzyme-catalysis. In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is released from the composition by a combination of a pH-dependent unfolding of the carrier peptide and enzyme-catalysis in a time-dependent manner. The active agent is released from the composition in a sustained release manner. In another preferred embodiment, the sustained release of the active agent from the composition has zero order, or nearly zero order, pharmacokinetics.<br>
[094] The present invention provides several benefits for active agent<br>
delivery. First, the invention can stabilize the active agent and prevent digestion in the stomach. In addition, the pharmacologic effect can be prolonged by delayed or<br>
sustained release of the active agent. The sustained release can occur by virtue of the active agent being covalently attached to the peptide and/or through the additional covalent attachment of an adjuvant that bioadheres to the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, active agents can be combined to produce synergistic effects. Also, absorption of the active agent in the intestinal tract can be enhanced either by virtue of being covalently attached to a peptide or through the synergistic effect of an added adjuvant. The invention also allows targeted delivery of active agents to specific sites of action.<br>
[095] A major portion of the enhanced performance imparted to active<br>
agents by the carrier peptide can be explained in terms of the composition's structure. Proteins, oligopeptides, and polypeptides are polymers of amino acids that have primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. The secondary structure of the peptide is the local conformation of the peptide chain and consists of helices, pleated sheets, and turns. The peptide's amino acid sequence and the structural constraints on the conformations of the chain determine the spatial arrangement of the molecule. The folding of the secondary structure and the spatial arrangement of the side chains constitute the tertiary structure.<br>
[096] Peptides fold because of the dynamics associated between<br>
neighboring atoms on the peptide and solvent molecules. The thermodynamics of peptide folding and unfolding are defined by the free energy of a particular condition of the peptide that relies on a particular model. The process of peptide folding involves, amongst other things, amino acid residues packing into a hydrophobic core. The amino acid side chains inside the peptide core occupy the same volume as they do in amino acid crystals. The folded peptide interior is therefore more like a crystalline solid than an oil drop and so the best model for determining forces contributing to peptide stability is the solid reference state.<br>
[097] The major forces contributing to the thermodynamics of peptide<br>
folding are Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, configurational entropy, and the hydrophobic effect. Considering peptide stability, the hydrophobic effect refers to the energetic consequences of removing apolar groups from the peptide interior and exposing them to water. Comparing the energy<br>
of amino acid hydrolysis with peptide unfolding in the solid reference state, the hydrophobic effect is the dominant force. Hydrogen bonds are established during the peptide fold process and intramolecular bonds are formed at the expense of hydrogen bonds with water. Water molecules are "pushed out" of the packed, hydrophobic peptide core. All of these forces combine and contribute to the overall stability of the folded peptide where the degree to which ideal packing occurs determines the degree of relative stability of the peptide. The result of maximum packing is to produce a center of residues or hydrophobic core that has maximum shielding from solvent.<br>
[098] Since it is likely that a hydrophobic active agent would reside in the<br>
hydrophobic core of a peptide, it would require energy to unfold the peptide before the active agent can be released. The unfolding process requires overcoming the hydrophobic effect by hydrating the amino acids or achieving the melting temperature of the peptide. The heat of hydration is a destabilization of a peptide. Typically, the folded state of a peptide is favored by only 5-15 kcal/mole over the unfolded state. Nonetheless, peptide unfolding at neutral pH and at room temperature requires chemical reagents. In fact, partial unfolding of a peptide is often observed prior to the onset of irreversible chemical or conformation processes. Moreover, peptide conformation generally controls the rate and extent of deleterious chemical reactions.<br>
[099] Conformational protection of active agents by peptides depends on<br>
the stability of the peptide's folded state and the thermodynamics associated with the agent's decomposition. Conditions necessary for the agent's decomposition should be different than for peptide unfolding.<br>
[0100] Selection of the amino acids will depend on the physical properties<br>
desired. For instance, if increase in bulk or lipophilicity is desired, then the carrier peptide will be enriched in the amino acids that have bulky, lipophilic side chains. Polar amino acids, on the other hand, can be selected to increase the hydrophilicity of the peptide.<br>
[100] Ionizing amino acids can be selected for pH controlled peptide<br>
unfolding. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and tyrosine carry a neutral charge in the<br>
stomach, but will ionize upon entry into the intestine. Conversely, basic amino acids, such as histidine, lysine, and arginine, ionize in the stomach and are neutral in an alkaline environment.<br>
[101] Other factors such as K-n interactions between aromatic residues,<br>
kinking of the peptide chain by addition of proline, disulfide crosslinking, and hydrogen bonding can all be used to select the optimum amino acid sequence for a desired performance parameter. Ordering of the linear sequence can influence how these interactions can be maximized and is important in directing the secondary and tertiary structures of the polypeptide.<br>
[102] Variable molecular weights of the carrier peptide can have profound<br>
effects on the active agent release kinetics. As a result, low molecular weight active agent delivery systems are preferred. An advantage of this invention is that chain length and molecular weight of the peptide can be optimized depending on the level of conformational protection desired. This property can be optimized in concert with the kinetics of the first phase of the release mechanism. Thus, another advantage of this invention is that prolonged release time can be imparted by increasing the molecular weight of the carrier peptide.<br>
[103] Another, significant advantage of the invention is that the kinetics of<br>
active agent release is primarily controlled by the enzymatic hydrolysis of the key bond between the carrier peptide and the active agent. The enzymes encountered in the lumen of the intestines, on the intestinal cell surface, and within the cells lining the intestine may completely remove the drug from the carrier peptide before it reaches the bloodstream. Accordingly, concerns about the safety of the novel composition are eliminated.<br>
[104] Dextran has been explored as a macromolecular carrier for the<br>
covalent binding of drug for colon specific drug delivery. Generally, it was only possible to load up to 1/10 of the total drug-dextran conjugate weight with drug. As stated earlier, polysaccharides are digested mainly in the colon and drug absorption is mainly limited to the colon. As compared to dextran, this invention has at least two major advantages. First, peptides are hydrolyzed by any one of several aminopeptidases found in the intestinal lumen or associated with the brush-border<br>
membrane and so active agent release and subsequent absorption can occur in the jejunum or the ileum. Second, the molecular weight of the carrier molecule can be controlled and, thus, active agent loading can also be controlled. [105] As a practical example, the Table 1 below lists the molecular weights<br>
of lipophilic amino acids (less one water molecule) and selected analgesics and vitamins.<br>
[106] Lipophilic amino acids are preferred because confonnational<br>
protection through the stomach is important for the selected active agents, which were selected based on ease of covalent attachment to an oligopeptide. Eighteen was subtracted from the amino acid's molecular weight so that their condensation into a peptide is considered. For example, a decamer of glycine (MW=588) linked to aspirin would have a total molecular weight of 750 and aspirin would represent 24% of the total weight of the active agent delivery composition or over two times the maximum drug loading for dextran. This is only for an N- or C- terminus application, for those active agents attached to pendant groups of decaglutamic acid, for instance, a drug with a molecular weight of 180 could conceivably have a loading of 58%, although this may not be entirely practical.<br>
[107] In one embodiment the active agent is attached to a peptide that<br>
ranges between a single amino acid and 450 amino acids in length. In another embodiment two to 50 amino acids are preferred, with the range of one to 12 amino acids being more preferred, and one to 8 amino acids being most preferred. In another embodiment the number of amino acids is selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7<br>
amino acids. In another embodiment of the invention the molecular weight of the carrier portion of the conjugate is below about 2,500, more preferably below about 1,000 and most preferably below about 500.<br>
[108] In another embodiment the active agent conjugate is a dimer, of an<br>
active agent and a single amino acid. In another embodiment the active agent conjugate is attached to a dipeptide or tripeptide.<br>
[109] Compositions of the invention comprise four essential types of<br>
attachment. These types of attachment are termed: C-capped, N-capped, side-chain attached, and interspersed. C-capped comprises the covalent attachment of an active agent to the C-terminus of a peptide either directly or through a linker. N-capped comprises the covalent attachment of an active agent to the N-terminus of a peptide either directly or through a linker. Side-chain attachment comprises the covalent attachment of an active agent to the functional sidechain of a peptide either directly or through a linker. Interspersed comprises the attachment of active agents which themselves are amino acids. In this case the active agent would constitute a portion of the amino acid chain. Interspersed is herein meant to include the amino acid active agent (drug) being at the C-terminus, N-terminus, or interspersed throughout the peptide. When amino acid active agents are attached to the C-terminus or the N-terminus this results in the active agent being the end amino and is considered C-capped or N-capped respectively. Furthermore, amino acids with reactive side chains (e.g., glutamic acid, lysine, aspartic acid, serine, threonine and cysteine) can be incorporated for attaching multiple active agents or adjuvants to the same carrier peptide. This is particularly useful if a synergistic effect between two or more active agents is desired. The present invention also envisions the use of multiple active agents or multiple attachment sites of active agents along a peptide chain. Further embodiments of the invention will become clear from the following disclosure. [110] The alcohol, amine or carboxylic acid group of the active agent is<br>
covalently attached to the N-terminus, the C-terminus or the side chain of the peptide. The location of attachment depends somewhat on the functional group selection. For instance, if the active drug is a carboxylic acid (e.g., aspirin) then the N-terminus of the oligopeptide is the preferred point of attachment. If the active<br>
agent is an amine (e.g., ampicillin), then the C-terminus is the preferred point of attachment in order to achieve a stable peptide linked active agent. In both, the C-and N-terminus examples, one monomeric unit forming a new peptide bond in essence, adds a molecule to the end of the peptide.<br>
[Ill] If the active agent is an amine, an alternate method of attaching the<br>
amine to the C-terminus of the peptide is to allow the amine to initiate polymerization of the amino acid NCA's. If the active agent is an alcohol, then either the C-terminus or the N-terminus is the preferred point of attachment in order to achieve a stable composition. For example, when the active agent is an alcohol, the alcohol can be converted into an alkylchloroformate with phosgene or triphosgene. This intermediate is then reacted with the N-terminus of the peptide carrier to produce an active agent peptide composition linked via a carbamate. The carbamate active ingredient may then be released from the peptide carrier by intestinal peptidases, amidases, or esterases.<br>
[112] Alternatively, an alcohol active agent can be selectively bound to the<br>
gamma carboxylate of glutamic acid and then this conjugate covalently attached to the C-terminus of the peptide carrier. Because the glutamic acid-drug conjugate can be considered a dimer, this product adds two monomeric units to the C-terminus of the peptide carrier where the glutamic acid moiety serves as a spacer between the peptide and the drug. Intestinal enzymatic hydrolysis of the key peptide bond releases the glutamic acid-drug moiety from the peptide carrier. The newly formed free amine of the glutamic acid residue will then undergo an intramolecular transamination reaction, thereby, releasing the active agent with coincident formation of pyroglutamic acid as shown in Figure 1.<br>
[113] Alternatively, the glutamic acid-drug dimer can be converted into the<br>
gamma ester of glutamic acid N-carboxyanhydride. This intermediate can then be polymerized, as described above, using any suitable initiator. The product of this polymerization is polyglutamic acid with active ingredients attached to multiple pendant groups. Hence, maximum drug loading of the carrier peptide can be achieved. In addition, other amino acid-NCA's can be copolymerized with the<br>
gamma ester glutamic acid NCA to impart specific properties to the drug delivery system.<br>
[114] Alternatively, the alcohol can be added to the chloroformate of the<br>
side chain of polyserine as shown in section III of the Examples. The product is a carbonate, which upon hydrolysis of the peptide bond an intramolecular rearrangement occurs releasing the drug much of the same was as described above. [115] If the active agent is a ketone or an aldehyde than a ketal is formed<br>
with a linker that has a pendant group suitable for attachment to the N-terminus, C-terminus or side chain of the peptide. For example, a ketal can be formed by the reaction of methylribofuranoside or glucose with methylnaltrexone as shown in example of glucose reacting with methylnaltrexone. The remaining free hydroxyl from the sugar moiety can then be treated as an alcohol for attachment to the C-terminus or a suitable side chain of the carrier peptide.<br>
[116] The invention also provides a method of imparting the same<br>
mechanism of action for other peptides containing functional side chains. Examples include, but are not limited to, polylysine, polyasparagine, polyarginine, polyserine, polycysteine, polytyrosine, polythreonine and polyglutamine. The mechanism can translate to these peptides through a spacer or linker on the pendant group, which is terminated, preferably, by the glutamic acid-active agent dimer. The side-chain attached carrier peptide-active agent conjugate is preferably releases the active agent moiety through peptidase and not necessarily esterase activity. Alternatively, the active agent can be attached directly to the pendant group where some other indigenous enzymes in the alimentary tract can affect release. [117] If the active agent is an amide or an imide then the nitrogen of the<br>
active agent can add in a Michael fashion to the dihydopyran carboxylic acid alkyl ester as shown in section VII:D of the Examples. The R group can either be an electron-withdrawing group such that transesterification with the side chain of the peptide can occur or the R group can be part of the side chain of the peptide. The release of the active agent from the linker is imparted by hydrolysis of the peptide carboxylate bond followed by a concerted decarboxylation/elimination reaction.<br>
[118] The active agent can be covalently attached to the N-terminus, the C-<br>
terminus or the side chain of the peptide using known techniques. In the case where the active agent is an amino acid (e.g. Thyroxine, Triiodothyronine, DOPA, etc.) the active agent can be interspersed within the peptide chain in a peptide linked manner in addition to be covalently attached to the N-terminus, C-terrninus or the side chains as described above. It is the preferred embodiment of the invention that the interspersed copolymer of the amino acid active agent and neutral amino acid be produced by polymerizing a mixture of the respective amino acid NCA's. [119] The composition of the invention comprises a peptide and an active<br>
agent covalently attached to the peptide. Examples of active agents that may be used with the present invention include, but are not limited to, those active agents listed in Table 2, either alone or in combination with other agents contained within Table 2. As one of skill in the art would readily understand, the active agents listed within Table 2 may exist in modified form to facilitate bioavailability and/or activity (e.g., a Sodium salt, halide-containing derivatives or HC1 forms of an active agent listed in Table 2). Accordingly, the invention encompasses variants (i.e., salts, halide derivatives, HC1 forms) of the active agents listed in Table 2.<br>
[120] The present invention allows for the combination of different active<br>
agents with a variety of peptides to impart specific characteristics according to the desired solubility, pH or folding. Similarly, the variety of peptides may be used to impart specific physicochemical properties to produce specific performance characteristics. The present invention provides significant advantages with respect to the stability and release and/or adsorption characteristics of the active agent(s). The conjugates of the present invention are also suited for delivery of both large and small molecules.<br>
[121] In another embodiment, the use of one or more of the 20 naturally<br>
occurring amino acids as individual amino acids, in oligopeptides, or in polypeptides impart specific stability, digestibility and release characteristics to the conjugates formed with active agents.<br>
[122] In another embodiment, the active agent conjugates are designed to<br>
interact with specific indigenous enzymes so that targeted delivery may be achieved. These conjugates provide targeted delivery in all regions of the gut and at specific sites along the intestinal wall. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent conjugates can incorporate adjuvants such that the compositions are designed to interact with specific receptors so that targeted delivery may be achieved. These compositions provide targeted delivery in all regions of the gut and at specific sites along the intestinal wall. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is released as the reference active agent from the peptide conjugate prior to entry into a target cell. In another preferred embodiment, the specific amino acid sequences used are not targeted to specific cell receptors or designed for recognition by a specific genetic sequence. In a more preferred embodiment, the peptide carrier is designed for recognition and/or is not recognized by tumor promoting cells. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent delivery system does not require that the active agent be released within a specific cell or intracellularly. [123] In another embodiment, the active agent conjugate allows for<br>
multiple active agents to be attached. The conjugates provide the added benefit of allowing multiple attachment not only of active agents, but of active agents in combination with other active agents, or other modified molecules which can further<br>
modify delivery, enhance release, target delivery, and/or enhance adsorption. By way of example, the conjugates may also be combined with adjuvants or can be microencapsulated.<br>
[124] In another embodiment of the invention, the composition includes<br>
one or more adjuvants to enhance the bioavailability of the active agent. Addition of an adjuvant is particularly preferred when using an otherwise poorly absorbed active agent. Suitable adjuvants, for example, include: papain, which is a potent enzyme for releasing the catalytic domain of aminopeptidase-N into the lumen; glycorecognizers, which activate enzymes in the brush border membrane (BBM); and bile acids, which have been attached to peptides to enhance absorption of the peptides.<br>
[125] In another embodiment absorption may be improved by increasing<br>
the solubility of the parent drug through selective attachment of an amino acid, oligopeptide, or polypeptide. Increasing solubility results in an increase in the dissolution rate. Consequently, there is an increase in the total amount of drug that is available for absorption; since the drug must be in solution for absorption to occur, bioavailability is increased.<br>
[126] In another embodiment the compositions provide for a wide range of<br>
pharmaceutical applications including active agent delivery, cell targeting, and enhanced biological responsiveness.<br>
[127] The present invention provides several benefits for active agent<br>
delivery. First, the invention can stabilize the active agent and prevent digestion in the stomach. In addition, the pharmacologic effect can be prolonged by delayed or sustained release of the active agent. The sustained release can occur by virtue of the active agent being covalently attached to the peptide and/or through the additional covalent attachment of an adjuvant that bioadheres to the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, active agents can be combined to produce synergistic effects. [128] Absorption of the active agent in the intestinal tract can be enhanced<br>
either by virtue of being covalently attached to a peptide or through the synergistic effect of an added adjuvant. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the absorption of the active agent is increased due to its covalent attachment to a<br>
peptide, hereafter to be referred to as a transporter peptide, which is a specialized example of a carrier peptide. In a further embodiment, the transporter peptide activates a specific peptide transporter. In yet another embodiment the peptide transporter is either the PepTl or the PepT2 transporters. In a preferred embodiment the transporter peptide contains two amino acids. In another preferred embodiment the transporter dipeptide is selected from the list of AlaSer, CysSer, AspSer, GluSer, PheSer, GlySer, HisSer, EeSer, LysSer, LeuSer, MetSer, AsnSer, ProSer, GlnSer, ArgSer, SerSer, ThrSer, ValSer, TrpSer, TyrSer.<br>
[129] In another embodiment, the present invention does not require the<br>
attachment of the active agent to an adjuvant that recognizes or is taken up by an active transporter. The invention also allows targeted delivery of active agents to specifics sites of action.<br>
[130] In another preferred embodiment the chain length of amino acid can<br>
be varied to suit different delivery criteria. In one embodiment, the present invention allows for the delivery of active agents with sustained release. [131] The invention may further be characterized by the following<br>
embodiments wherein the active agent is released as the reference active agent from the amino acid conjugate prior to entry into the target cell for the active agent. In another preferred embodiment the active agent is prepared and/or administered through means other than implantation and/or injectibles. Embodiments of the present invention preferably do not produce and antigenic response or otherwise stimulate the immune system in the host.<br>
[132] Another embodiment of the present invention, for compositions<br>
administered by methods outside the alimentary tract, the intact conjugate may be less susceptible to first pass metabolism by the enterocytes, including biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and efflux by transporter P-glycoprotein. Immunogenicity and metabolic effects are avoided through maintenance of the three dimensional structure of the composition, maintaining blood levels below the threshold value for expression of these metabolic factors or some other means.<br>
[133] In another preferred embodiment the active agent is directly attached<br>
to the amino acid without the use of a linker.<br>
[134] To predict the absorption of orally delivered drugs monolayers of<br>
Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells are increasingly being used. Caco-2 cells are grown on the surface of collagen-coated wells in a 24 well format to form confluent monolayers that represent small segments of the intestine. The wells are removable and contain a top chamber representing the apical side (facing the lumen of the intestine) and a bottom chamber representing the basolateral side (site of serosal drug absorption). Testing the electrical resistance across the monolayer monitors the integrity of the epithelial barrier. Absorption of drugs can be studied by adding sample to the apical side and assaying the concentration of the drug in the basolateral chamber following incubation.<br>
[135] The small intestine has an extremely large surface area covered with<br>
highly specialized epithelial cells that produce both extracellular and intracellular enzymes. The Caco-2 cells also release enzymes similar to the epithelial cells of the small intestine. There is not much precedent for using the Caco-2 cells as models for digesting synthetic peptides. However, drug release from peptides on the apical side of Caco-2 transwell monolayers can be measured. The copolymer of glutamic acid and thyroxine enhanced the absorption of thyroxine across the Caco-2 monolayers.<br>
[136] In another embodiment, the invention provides methods of testing the<br>
conjugates using Caco-2 cells.<br>
[137] The Table 3 provides a list of active agents that have been covalently<br>
attached to a peptide. The table also provides a list of typical areas of use for the active agent conjugate.<br>
A=Alanine, D=Aspartic Acid, E=Glutamic Acid, F=Phenyalanine, G=Glycine, I=Isoleucine, K=Lysine, M=Methionine, S=Serine, T=Threonine, V=Valine<br>
[138] The compositions of the invention can be formulated in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions by combining the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient known in the art. The conjugates may be employed in powder or crystalline form, in liquid solution, or in suspension. The conjugates of the present invention may be administered by a variety of means, including but not limited to: topically, orally, parenterally by injection (intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously), as a depot implant, an intranasal preparation, an inhaler, or as an anal suppository. The injectable compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain various formulating agents. Alternatively, the conjugate may be in powder form for reconstitution at the time of delivery with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. In injectable compositions, the carrier is typically comprised of sterile water, saline or another injectable liquid, e.g., peanut oil for intramuscular injections. Also, various buffering agents, preservatives and the like can be included. Topical applications may be formulated in carriers such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases to form ointments, creams, lotions, in aqueous, oleaginous or in dry diluents to form powders. Oral compositions may take such forms as tablets, capsules, oral suspensions and oral solutions. The oral compositions may utilize carriers such as conventional formulating agents, and may include sustained release properties as well as rapid delivery forms. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated, the route and<br>
" frequency of administration. One embodiment of the methods of administration of the conjugates includes oral and parenteral methods, e.g., i.v. infusion, i.v. bolus and i.m. injection. In a further embodiment of the invention, the composition incorporates a microencapsulating agent. Preferably, the composition of the invention is in the form of an ingestible tablet or capsule, an implantable device, a skin patch, a sublingual preparation, a subcutaneous preparation, an intravenous preparation, an intraperitoneal preparation, an intramuscular preparation or an oral suspension. Most preferably the compositions are formulated for oral delivery. [139] Throughout the applications the figures are meant to describe the<br>
general scheme of attaching active agents through different functional groups to a variety of peptide conjugates resulting in different embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art would recognize other reagents, conditions, and properties necessary to conjugate other active agents to other peptides from the schemes, which are meant to be non-limiting examples. The figures further represent the different embodiments of the present invention with regard to length of the active agent conjugate wherein the amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, oligopeptide and peptide active agent conjugates can be respectively represented by n=0 for an amino acid, and n&gt;l for other peptide embodiments.<br>
I N-Terminus Attachment of an Active Agents to a Peptide<br>
[140] The N-terminus attachment of active agent to a peptide can be formed<br>
through a plurality of active agent functional groups. Non-limiting examples of active agent functional groups include an alcohol group, a carboxylic acid group, an amine group or other reactive substiuents. The preferred active agent attaching functionalities for N-terminus attachment to a peptide include carboxylic acids, ketones and aldehydes. When the attachment at the N-terminus is to be made with an alcohol or its equivalent, or an amine or its equivalent an insertion of a linker between the functional group and the active agent is typically required. [141] Any amino acid may be used as the N-terminus of the peptide/active<br>
agent conjugate. Preferred amino acids for attachment include glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and lysine.<br>
[142] Specific examples of an active agent attached to the N-terminus<br>
below are meant for example purposes only and are not meant to limit the invention to either specific active agents, amino acids or combinations thereof. Preferred drugs for N-terminus attachment typically provide a carboxylic acid or an inorganic functional group for conjugation. By way of example, ibuprofen, furosemide, gemfibrozil, naproxen may be attached to the N-terminus.<br>
[143] The below schemes depict methods of attaching active agents to the<br>
N-terminus. These figures and procedures describe the general scheme of attaching active agents to the N-terminus of a peptide.<br>
(i) General Mechanism and Description of Conjugation of Acid Drug Attachment to the N-Terminus<br>
- Acid Drug/N-Terminus Scheme -<br>
[144] As depicted an acid bioactive agent can be dissolved in DMF under<br>
nitrogen and cooled to 0 °C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the amine peptide carrier. The reaction can then be stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered off, and the product precipitated out in ether and purified using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or dialysis.<br>
(ii) General Mechanism and Description of Conjugation of Alcohol Drug Attachment to the N-Terminus<br>
- Alcohol Drug/N-Terminus Scheme -<br>
[145] As depicted above the combination of the alcohol with triphosgene<br>
produces a chloroformate, which when reacted with the N-terminus of the peptide produces a carbamate. Pursuant to this, an alcohol bioactive agent can be treated with triphosgene in dry DMF under nitrogen. The suitably protected peptide carrier is then added slowly and the solution stirred at room temperature for several hours.<br>
The product is then precipitated out in ether. The crude product is suitably deprotected and purified using GPC.<br>
[146] Other solvents, activating agents, co-catalysts and bases can be used.<br>
Examples of other solvents include dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethers such as tetrahydrofuran(THF) or chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3). Examples of other activating agents include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or thionyl chloride. An example of another co-catalyst is N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Examples of bases include pyrrolidinopyridine, dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine (Et3N) or tributylamine.<br>
I:A - Example: Attachment of Furosemide via Carboxvlic Acid to the N-terminus of PoIvfSerine)<br>
[147] The below example describes the attachment of an amino acid active<br>
agent to the N-terminus of a peptide. The example uses polySer attached to Furosemide.<br><br>
[148] To a solution of pSer(OtBu) in N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) was<br>
added Furosemide-OSu and N-methyl morpholine (NMM). The reaction was stirred<br>
overnight at room temperature. Solid material remained so reaction was stirred overnight at 60°C. After cooling, reaction was placed in water (50 mL), solid was collected by filtration and solid was dried (0.480 g, 86% yield).<br>
[149] Deprotection of pSer(OtBu) proceeded by adding 95%TFA/H2O to<br>
the above material. The resulting dark solution was stirred overnight. Solvent was then removed, NaHCO3 (saturated solution) added and the crude product was purified using ultrafiltration (YM1) to obtain Furosemide-pSer (O.lOlg) as a dark green solid.<br>
I:B - Example: Attachment of Enalipril via Carboxylic Acid to the N-terminus of GluGlu.<br>
Synthesis of Enalipril-Glu-Glu<br>
[150] To enalipril maleate (0.200 g, 406 umol), hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(0.164 g, 1217 umol), Glu(OtBu)Glu(OtBu)OtBu (0.560 g, 1217 umol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.210 ml, 1217 umol) in 7 ml dry DMF was added O-(1H-benzotriazol-lyl)N,N,N',N' tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (0.461 g, 1217 umol). After stirring for 16 h under Argon, 40 ml of saturated NaCl (aq) was added to the black solution. The reaction was extracted 2x10 ml EtOAc (dark colored stayed with the organics). The organics were dried with anhyd. MgSO4, filtered and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2 1:0-60:1-40:1-30:1-20:1-10:1 ) to provide Enalipril-Glu(OtBu)Glu(OtBu)OtBu as a yellowish gum (0.231 g, 54%): Rf 0.43 (9:1 CHCl3:MeOH + 1 drop HOAc); 1H-NMR (DMSO/CDC13) 7.13 (m, 5H), 4.43-4.09 (m, 5H), 2.20 (m, 7H), 1.97-1.80 (m, 13H), 1.35 (m, 27H), 1.22 (m, 6H); ESMS 803.<br>
[151] Enalipril-Glu(OtBu)Glu(OtBu)OtBu (0.172 g, 214 umol) was stirred<br>
for 7.5 h with 9.5 ml trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5 ml H2O. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the residue dried in vacuum. 'H-NMR (DMSO) 7.13 (m, 5H), 4.43-4.09 (m, 5H), 2.20 (m, 7H), 1.97-1.80 (m, 13H), 1.42 (m, 3H), 1.22 (m, 3H); FABMS calc 635.293, ob 635.490.<br>
II C-Terminus Attachment of Active Agents to a Peptide<br>
[152] The C-terminus attachment of an active agent to a peptide can be<br>
formed through a plurality of active agent functional groups. The functional groups include amines and their equivalents and alcohols and their equivalents. While any amino acid may be used to connect the active agent to the C-terminus, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine and lysine are preferred amino acids. Preferred active agents for C-terminus attachment are active agents with alcohol and amino functional groups. More preferred active agents include atenolol, metropolol, propanolol, methylphenidate and sertraline.<br>
[153] The below scheme depicts methods of attaching active agents to the<br>
C-terminus. One skilled in the art would recognize other reagents, conditions, and properties necessary to conjugate other active agents from the schemes, which are meant to be non-limiting examples.<br>
[154] This figure and procedure describe the general scheme of attaching<br>
an amine active agent to the C-terminus of a peptide. In the below scheme the peptide carrier can be dissolved in DMF under nitrogen and cooled to 0 °C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the amine bioactive agent. The reaction can then be stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered off, and the product precipitated out in ether and purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>
[155] Specific examples of active agent attached to the C-terminus below<br>
are meant for example purposes only and are not meant to limit the invention to either specific active agents, amino acids or combinations thereof.<br>
II;A - Example; Amine-Initiated Polymerization of L-Glutamic Acid NCA<br>
[156] This example can be used to genetically describe the process of an<br>
amine active agent initiating polymerization of an amino acid NCA. The following procedure was successfully used to synthesize the polyglutamic acid conjugate of atenolol through its amine functionality. It should also be noted that atenolol is also an alcohol active agent and can also initiate polymerization of amino acid NCA's. This procedure can readily be applied to other amine drugs described herein.<br>
[157] Table 4 describes the relative proportions that would be used in a<br>
typical atenolol preparation. Other amine drugs that would be used to initiate polymerization of an amino acid NCA would be expected to utilize similar proportions.<br>
[158] The procedure is further described below, although those skilled in<br>
the art would recognize other solvents, proportions and reaction conditions that could be utilzed to achieve the desired results. DMF is dimethylformamide, anhydrous, and was purchased from Aldrich. The glassware was oven-dried prior to use. Glu-NCA (500 mg, 2.89 mmoles) was dissolved in 4 mL of DMF and stirred under argon in a 15 mL round bottom flask equipped with a gas inlet tube. Atenolol, dissolved in 1 mL of DMF, was added to this solution of Glu-NCA and allowed to stir at room temperature for 72 h. In general, the reactions can be run until there is no free amine initiator by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). For this reaction, TLC was run using silica plates and eluting with 20% methanol in ethyl acetate. The reaction was quenched by pouring into 20 mL of 10% sodium bicarbonate in water (pH = 8). The water was washed with 3 x 20 mL of methylene chloride and 3 x 20 mL of ethyl acetate. Combined aqueous layers were brought to a pH of 6 with 6N hydrochloric acid (HC1) and reduced to a volume of about 20 mL by rotary evaporation.<br>
[159] This solution was then cooled in the refrigerator for &gt; 3 hours. To<br>
precipitate the polymeric product, the aqueous solution was then acidified to a pH of<br>
about 2 using 6N HC1 and placed back in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours. The suspension was poured by portions into a 10 mL test tube and centrifuged for 15 minutes until the precipitate formed a solid pack at the bottom of the tube from which the water could be decanted. (At this point in the general procedure, it is preferable that the solid be filtered through a filter funnel and washed with acidic water. The centrifuge was used for atenolol because the solid was too thin to filter.) The solid was then resuspended in acidic water (pH about 2) and vortexed before being centrifuged again and the water decanted. This procedure was repeated once more for a total of three washes. The solid was then dried by high vacuum overnight yielding 262 mg (59%) of polymer. NMR analysis indicated that the Glu/Atenolol ratio was about 30/1.<br>
II:B - Example: Preparation of (Glu)n-Cephalexin via an Amine Bond<br>
[160] The below example describes the attachment of an ammo acid active<br>
agent to the C-terminus of a peptide. The example uses glutamic acid NCA to produce a polyGlu attached to Cephalexin. Cephalexin attached to a single amino acid may be produced via the below method if an excess amount of Cephalexin is added to the procedure.<br>
[161] Glu(OtBu)NCA (1.000 g, 4.4 mmol) and Cephalexin»HCl (0.106 g,<br>
0.3 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5 mL). The reaction was then allowed to stir at room temperature under argon. After 3 days, the solvent was removed by rotary-evaporation under vacuum. The resulting solid was then placed under argon and then dissolved in 4N HC1 in Dioxane (2mL) and then allowed to stir at room temperature under a blanket of argon. After 1 hour, the dioxane and HC1 were removed by rotary-evaporation under vacuum. The solid was then suspended in methanol (2 mL) and once more brought to dryness by rotary-evaporation in order to remove residual HC1 and dioxane. This material was then resuspended in methanol (2 mL) and precipitated by the addition of water (20 mL). The aqueous suspension was then stored at 4°C for 4 hours, and the solid isolated by centrifugation. The pelleted material was then allowed to dry under vacuum over night. This process afforded a mixture of (Glu)n and (Glu)n-cephalexin (464mg) as<br>
determined by MALDI MALDI indicates a mixture of polymers (Glu)7-13<br>
 and (Glu)5_14-cephalexin. Other chain-lengths may be present but they are not clearly visible in the MALDI spectra. Reversed-phase HPLC (265nm detection, C18 column, 16%MeOH/4%THF/80%water mobile phase) indicated that no free cephalexin was present in the isolated material. "Water" in the HPLC actually refers to an aqueous buffer of 0.1% heptanesulfonic acid and 1.5% triethylamine.<br>
II:C -Example: Synthesis of PolyGlu-Atenolol<br>
[162] The following procedure was successfully used to synthesize the<br>
polyglutamic acid conjugate of atenolol.<br>
DMF is dimethylformamide, anhydrous, and was purchased from Aldrich. Glassware was oven-dried, prior to use.<br>
[163] Glu-NCA (2 g, 11.56 mmoles) was dissolved in 8 mL of DMF and<br>
stirred under Ar in a 25 mL roundbottom flask equipped with a gas inlet tube. Atenolol, dissolved in 2 mL of DMF, was added to this solution of Glu-NCA and allowed to stir at room temperature for 93 h. Bubbles were observed at the beginning of the reaction. The DMF was reduced by rotary evaporation and the oil was transferred into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer, rinsing the round bottom well with water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 3 with 1 N HC1. This solution (60 mL total volume) was then cooled in the refrigerator for &gt; 3 hours. The suspension was filtered through a sintered glass funnel and washed with 3 X 30 mL of 1% AcOH in methanol followed by 3 X 30 mL of ethanol. The solid was then dried by high vacuum overnight yielding 892 mg (68%) of polymer. NMR analysis indicated<br>
that the Glu/Atenolol ratio was about 15/1. This is based on the relative integrations of the methyl groups on the N-isopropyl substituent of atenolol (6 protons) and the p and ? protons of the Glu (2 each).<br>
H;D - Example; Synthesis of [Glu]15-Carbadopa<br>
[164] To 50 mg of Carbadopa (0.22 mmoles) dissolved in 4 mL of dry<br>
dimethylformamide, add 573 mg (3.3 mmoles) of GluNCA. Stir overnight under Argon. After the addition of 12 mL of H2O, pH = 2.0, the solution was ultrafiltered (regenerated cellulose, Millipore, YM1, NMWL = 1000) with an additional 100 mL of H20, pH = 2. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with 30 mL of H2O and dried in a vacuum at room temperature to yield 268 mg of a light brown powder. The Carbadopa to Glu ratio was determined by 1H NMR to be 1:4. 1H NMR (500MHz, DMSO) peak assignments are as follows: 86.61-6.58 (aromatic, Carbadopa), 6.47-6.41 (aromatic, Carbadopa), 4.25 (a, Glu), 2.25 (?, Glu), 2.00-1.65 (p\ Glu), 1.11 (CH3, Carbadopa).<br>
II:E - Example: Preparation of Drug-Glu Conjugate as a starting svnthon for polymerization<br>
[165] The example below is a description C-terminus attachment. The<br>
example describes how to attach a single amino acid to an active agent, one of the preferred embodiments. The example also provides an active agent/amino acid conjugate to which additional amino acids can be added resulting in the desired peptide. Preferred embodiments of the peptide include copolymers of glutamic acid<br>
and N-acetylcysteine.<br>
[166] With non-primary amine drug candidates, formation of the active<br>
agent-poly-Glu conjugate may require the formation of the activate agent/amino acid synthon prior to polymerization. The following scheme was used, wherein the active agent is first conjugated to Glu, and this synthon is then used to initiate<br>
coupling. Examples of this protocol are further described as applied to sertraline, propranolol and metoprolol.<br>
11:F - Protocol for coupling Boc-Glu(OtBu)-OH to Sertraline<br>
[167] Boc-Glu(OtBu)-OH (0.44 g, 1.46 mmol) and PyBOP (0.84 g, 1.60<br>
mmol) were dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL) with stirring. DIEA (0.31 mL, 1.75 mmol) was added and the amino acid derivative was allowed to activate for 15 minutes. Sertraline hydrochloride (0.50 g, 1.46 mmol) was added to the stirring mixture followed by an additional 0.31 mL DIEA. The mixture was allowed to stir for 16 hours. The solution was stripped yielding brown oil. The oil was dissolved in EtOAc (100 mL) and the resulting solution was washed with 10 % HC1 (3 x 30 mL), saturated NaHCO3, 4M NaHSO4, and brine (2 x 30 mL, respectively). The solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, yielding light brown oil. The oil was dried on the vacuum manifold and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/Hexanes 1:5 to 1:4 solvent system. The product fractions were pooled and solvent was again removed by rotary evaporation yielding 0.85 g (99%) of the final product, Sertraline-NH-C(O)-Glu-NH3+. The preparation was dried on the vacuum manifold.<br>

(i) Protocol for coupling Boc-Glu(OtBu)-OH to Propranolol<br>
[168] Boc-Glu(OtBu)-OH (0.44 g, 1.46 mmol) and PyBOP (0.84 g, 1.60<br>
mmol) were dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL) with stirring. DIEA (0.31 mL, 1.75 mmol) was added and the amino acid derivative was allowed to activate for 15 minutes. Propranolol hydrochloride (0.43 g, 1.46 mmol) was added to the stirring mixture followed by an additional 0.31 mL DIEA. The mixture was allowed to stir for 16 h. The solution was stripped yielding a brown oil. The oil was dissolved in EtOAc (100 mL) and the resulting solution was washed with 10 % HC1 (3 x 30 mL), saturated NaHCO3, 4M NaHSO4, and brine (2 x 30 mL, respectively). The solution was dried over MgSO/t, filtered and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, yielding light brown oil. The oil was dried on the vacuum manifold and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/Hexanes 1:5 to 1:4 solvent system. The product fractions were pooled<br>
and solvent was again removed by rotary evaporation the final product, Propranolol-NH-C(0)-Glu-NH3+. The preparation was dried on the vacuum manifold.<br>

Glu(21-Prednisone) (0.045 g, 92 pmol). After stirring for 68 h under Ar, 30 mL<br>
H2O was added. The reaction was acidified to pH 4 with 1 N HC1 and concentrated<br>
under vacuum. *H NMR (DMSO) analysis indicated 13:1 Glu:Prednisone ratio.<br>

III Side-chain attachment of drugs to a Peptide<br>
[183] The attachment of active agents to the side-chain of a peptide can be<br>
formed through a plurality of a combination of functional groups that can be selected from the active agent or amino acid used for conjugation. Unlike, when the active agent is conjugated to the N-terminus or C-terminus, where the functional group of the amino acid is restricted to either an amine or carboxylate group respectively, side-chain attachment allows for variability in the selection of specific amino acid side-chain functionalities. Additionally, where applicable the active agent functional group can be selected to conform to the amino acid side-chain utilized for attachment. The functional groups depend on the functionality on the side chain of a peptide utilized for conjugation. The diversity of side-chain attachment allows any active agent to be directly attached to the side chain of amino acids with appropriate functional groups. Active agents containing alcohols, amines and/or carboxylic acids are directly amenable to attachment through and may dictate the side-chain of the amino acid selected. For active agents that lack these functional groups it is preferred that the incorporation of a linker contain an alcohol, amine, or carboxylic group.<br>
[184] More preferred amino acids used to create the attachment and/or the<br>
peptide are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, lysine, cysteine, threonine, and glutamine. While homopolymers are often used, heteropolymers may be utilized to impart specific performance parameters. These heteropolymers may be of various chain length and degree of heterogeneity. Preferred examples include, but are not limited to, dipetides including Leu-Ser, Leu-Glu, homopolyers of Glu and Leu and heteropolymers of (Glu)n-Leu-Ser.<br>
[185] An example of side-chain attachment conjugation to an acid drug is<br>
depicted in the scheme below:<br>
[186] The below example is a depiction of a side-chain attachment of an<br>
acid drug. In this case the amino acid depicted is lysine:<br>

[188] An example of side-chain attachment conjugation to an alcohol drug<br>

[189] The below examples describe the general procedure for attachment of<br>
an araino acid active agent to the side-chain of a peptide. Examples IE: A - HI:G<br>
) describe the attachment of active agents to a peptide through the alcohol group. One of the examples describes the attachment of Naltrexone to aspartic acid, while the others show different active agents attached to glutamic acid. Examples DI:H - H[:I are illustrative of the conversion of one of the naturally occurring amino acids, in this case Glu, to a glutamic acid derivative for subsequent incorporation into a<br>
5 peptide either through the NCA method or through the use of a peptide synthesizer. Example EQ:J is further illustrative of the conversion of one of the naturally<br>
occurring amino acids, in this case Glu, to a glutamic acid derivative which can be further incorporated into a linear or dendritic peptide either through the NCA method or through the use of a peptide synthesizer. Examples ELK - ELN show a carboxylic acid attached to the side chain of an amino acid. In the present examples, the active agent is attached to Polylysine through the amino group. Example HI:O is describes a sulfonamide attached to the side-chain of a Polyglutamic acid. [190] Specific examples of active agent attached to the side-chain<br>
attachment below are meant for example purposes only and are not meant to limit the invention to either specific active agents, amino acids or combinations thereof. Those skilled in the art would recognize from the present disclosure other active agents, which can be attached to the side-chain of a peptide.<br>
III:A - Attachment of an Active Agent via an Alcohol Group to the Sidechain of Peptide<br><br>
[191] To a solution of poly(glutamic acid) in DMF was added N-methyl<br>
morpholine and bromo-fm-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP). The resulting mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. After this time, N-methyl morpholine and DMAP followed by drug were added. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature or at 60° C for 24 to<br>
48 hours. Solvent and excess base were then removed using reduced pressure evaporation. Water, methanol or i-propanol was then added and the resulting solid was collected and dissolved in NaHCO3(sat.). The crude product was purified using ultrafiltration. Product was then collected from ultrafiltration using acid precipitation, methanol precipitation, acetone precipitation or removal of water under reduced pressure.<br>

[192] The following examples describe the attachment of different alcohol<br>
active agents to the side chain of glutamic acid to produce a new ester bond. [193] The solids Boc-Glu-OtBu (0.96 g, 3.18 mmol), naltrexone (1.00 g,<br>
2.65 mmol) and PyBrop (1.73 g, 3.71 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of anhydrous<br>
DMF and stirred at room temperature under argon. Dry N-methylmorpholine (1.08 mL, 9.81 mmol) was added and the reaction allowed to continue stirring at room temperature under argon. After two days additional Boc-Glu-OtBu (0.096 g, 0.32 mmol), PyBrop (0.173 g, 0.37 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine (0.10 mL, 0.981 mmol) were added. After 2 more days, the solvent was removed by rotary-evaporation under high vacuum. The resulting residue was then dissolved in CHCI3, and the resulting organic solution extracted with 2 x 20 mL of saturated NaCl, 3 x 20 mL of 10% Na2CO3 and a final wash with 20 mL of saturated aqueous NaCl. The organic solution was collected, dried over sodium sulfate and then adsorbed onto silica. Pure naltrexone conjugated amino acid (0.486 g, 0.78 mmol, 29%) was then isolated by flash chromatography and a gradient of 0-1.5% CH3OH in CHCI3. The purity of the isolated material was determined by TLC (6:1 CH3OH:CHC13), and 1H NMR confirmed the presence of both the amino acid moiety and the naltrexone.

IV Amino Acid Active Agents and their Attachment to a Peptide<br>
[268] Amino acid active agents allow for a distinct embodiment of the<br>
present invention. This embodiment occurs when the active agent itself is an amino acid and thus capable of both amine and carboxylate bonding allowing for the interspersement of the active agent into the peptide chain. Amino acid drugs can be C-capped, N-capped and sidechain attached according to the procedures and mechanisms described above. As a unique aspect to amino acid drugs, the active agent may be interspersed within the peptide chain through a peptide bond at both ends of the active agent.<br>
[269] Most preferred drug conjugates for the interspersed attachment of<br>
amino acid active agents include amoxicillin; amoxicillin and clavulanate; baclofen; benazepril hydrochloride; candoxatril; captopril; carbidopa/Levodapa; cefaclor; cefadroxil; cephalexin; cilastatin sodium and imipenem; ciprofloxacin; diclofenac sodium; diclofenac sodium and misoprostol; enalapril; enapril maleate; gabapentin; levothyroxine; lisinopril; lisinopril and hydroichlorothiazide; loracarbef; mesalamine; pregabalin; quinapril hydrochloride; sitafloxacin; tirofiban hydrochloride; trandolapril; and trovafloxacin mesylate.<br>
IV: A - Preparation of Active Agent Conjugates (N-terminus)<br>
[271] In the following examples the amino acid active agent is attached to<br>
the N-terminus of different amino acids. These examples do not only describe an N-terminus attachment, but also represent the peptide linkage of the amino acid active agent as an amino acid to form either a dipeptide or a peptide conjugate. [272] T4 conjugated to amino acid polymers were either prepared by<br>
coupling (protected) T4 to commercially available amino acid homopolymers or incorporated by addition of T4-NCA to the corresponding polypeptide in situ.<br>
(i) T4 Conjugation to a Commercial Polyglycine<br>
[273] To N-TeocT4 (0.017 g, 17 umol) in 1 mL dry DMF was added<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.004 g, 18 umol). After stirring for 30 minutes N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.004 g, 36 umol) and Glyi8 (0.017 g, 17 umol) were added and the reaction stirred overnight. The cloudy solution was poured into 20<br>
mL H2O and extracted twice with 10 mL CH2C12. The aqueous component was<br>
acidified to pH 3 with 1 N HC1 and chilled to 4°C. The material was isolated by<br>
centrifugation and the pellet washed 3 times with 8 mL H2O. The pellet was dried in<br>
vacuum to yield dicyclohexylurea and N-TeocT4-Glyig.<br>
[274] 'H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 8 7.8 (T4 aromatic), 7.1 (T4<br>

removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL DMF and the<br>
insoluble material removed by filtration. The DMF was removed by rotary<br>
evaporation and dried in vacuum to yield a white material (.012 g, 40%).<br>

[279] To the L-amino acid (1.5 g) in 100 mL dry THF was added<br>
triphosgene (0.8 eqv). The reaction was vessel was equipped with a reflux condenser and NaOH trap and heated to reflux for 3 h. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the residue washed with hexane to yield the amino acid NCA as white residue.<br>

(iv) T4 Conjugation to Preformed Homopolymer in situ<br>
T4-Aspn<br>
[280] The below example depicts the attachment of T4 to the N-terminus of<br>
peptide conjugate poly Asp in situ. Polyserine and Polythreonine were also prepared using this protocol. The serine reaction mixture contained N-methylmorpholine (1.1 equivalents).<br>
[281] Polyaspartic acid: Asp(Otfiu) (13 mg, 0.07 mmol) and Asp(OtBu)-<br>
NCA (200 mg, 0.93 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5 mL), and the solution allowed to stir over night at room temperature under argon. The following morning, 2.5 mL of the reaction mixture was transferred to separate flask (Flask B). T4-NCA (27 mg, 0.03 mmol) was added to the original flask (Flask A), and both solutions were allowed to continue stirring under argon for an additional 24 hours. Polymer was then precipitated by the addition of water (50 mL) to each flask. The resulting solids were collected by filtration and dried over night under vacuum. [282] The dried Asp(OtBu)n (Flask B) and T4-Asp(OtBu)n (Flask A) were<br>
then dissolved in 95% trifluoroacetic acid in water (3 mL) and allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 hours. The deprotected polymers were then precipitated by the addition of ethyl ether (10 mL) and then storing the suspension at 4 °C for 2 hours. The respective polymers were then collected by filtration and the solids dried over night under vacuum. This afforded 48 mg of Aspn (Flask B) and 12 mg of T4-Aspn (Flask A). MALDI indicated that T4-Aspn (Flask A) consisted of a mixture of polymers of varying lengths: T4-Asp3.12.<br>
(3): The percent yield was estimated based on the total amino acid content in the original reaction prior to splitting the reaction. The Mass Range was determined from MALDI. The yield over 100% could reflect either the presence of salts or uneven distribution when the reaction mixture was split.<br>

(u) Deprotection of mPEG-Teoc-T3<br>
[311] The dried product from part A was stirred in 3 mL of TFA at room<br>
temperature for one hour. The TFA was removed by rotary evaporation of the azeotrope with hexane. The residue was dissolved in 3 mL of DMF and this solution was poured into 50 mL of ether. This suspension was cooled to 4°C, filtered and dried by high vacuum for 5 hours. This material was further purified by<br>
utrafiltxation (3,000 MW) filter using saturated sodium bicarbonate as a diluent. The product was dissolved in 10 mL of diluent and passed through the filter at 40 psi the rinsed in a similar manner 4 times. The residue was taken up in 3 mL of water and the filter was rinsed two additional times with 3 mL of water. The combined solution was frozen and lyophilized resulting in 162 mg (55%) of a fluffy white powder. T3 quantity present in conjugate by UV potency (?320, 1 M NaOH) was determined to 5.3% of total mass.<br>
IV:F - Preparation of Triiodothyronine Cvclodextrin Ester<br>

After stirring the suspension for 26 h under Ar 20 mL H2O was added. The cloudy white solution was filtered through glasswool and washed with 20 mL EtOAc. The water was removed by lyophilization and the off white residue purified by flash chromatography (C18 CH3OH) to provide roughly a 1:1 mixture of TeocT3-(3-CD (Rf 7:7:5:4 EtOAc:2-propanol:NH40H:H20) 0.64) and unmodified |}-CD (Rf 0.28) as an off-white solid (0.098 g).<br>

The ?-alkayl glutamate product can be precipitated out in acetone, filtered, dried and recrystallized from hot water.<br>
(ii) Preparation of y-Alkyl Glutamate-NCA<br>
[315] y-Alkyl glutamate can be suspended in dry THF where triphosgene is<br>

(iii) Preparation of Poly[y-Alkyl Glutamate]<br>
[316] y-Alkyl glutamate-NCA can be dissolved in dry DMF where a<br>
catalytic amount of a primary amine can be added to the solution until it becomes viscous (typically overnight). The product can be isolated from the solution by pouring it into water and filtering. The product can be purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>
(iv) ?-AIkyl GIutamate/C-Terminus Conjugation<br>
[317] Again in reference to the above scheme, the peptide carrier can be<br>
dissolved in DMF under nitrogen and cooled to 0 °C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the y-alkyl glutamate bioactive agent. The reaction can then be stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered off, and the product precipitated out in ether and purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>

[318] Benzylglutamic acid (25 grams) was suspended in 400 mL anhydrous<br>
ethyl acetate under nitrogen. The mixture was heated to reflux where 30 grams of triphosgene was added in six (6) equal portions. The reaction was refluxed for three (3) hours until homogenous. The solution was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The white powder was recrystallized from 50 mL of hot anhydrous ethyl acetate to yield 17.4 grams (63%) of a white powder.<br>

[319] Benzylglutamic acid (17.4 grams) was dissolved in anhydrous<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) under nitrogen where 238 mg of sodium methoxide was added portion wise. The solution was stirred for two (2) days with a marked increase in viscosity. The solution was poured into 1.5 L of petroleum ether with stirring. The petroleum ether was decanted off and an additional 1L of petroleum ether was added back. The mixture was stirred by hand, the petroleum ether was decanted off and the process repeated with 500 mL of petroleum ether. The white solid was air-dried and then vacuum dried to yield 14.7 (95%) of a white fluffy paper-like solid.<br>

VI Mulitple Attachment of Active Agent to a Peptide<br>
[330] In another preferred embodiment of the invention, more than one<br>
active agent may be attached to a peptide. In the case of oligopeptides and polypeptides, the active agents may be distributed randomly or at set intervals along the chain through side-chain attachments, as well as, terminate in either C-capped and/or N-capped active agents. Additionally, in the case of amino acid active agents the amino acid active agent may be interspersed similar to the side-chain distribution. The distribution may further be grouped intervals of active agents at the ends of the chain or throughout the peptide.<br>
[331] The below example provides a description of the attachment of an<br>
active agent to the side chain and C-terminus of a peptide. In the below example, the peptide chain comprises PolyGlu. Additionally, in the below example the active agent is attached through a carboxylate group.<br>
[332] One skilled in the art will appreciate that other peptides can be<br>
substituted depending on the active agent selected. Likewise, one skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the attachment of the active agent can be from different functional groups.<br>
[333] The general scheme for attaching an acitive agent to the N-terminus<br>
and the side chain of an amino acid is further illustrated below through the preparation of furosemide conjugated to serine.<br>
VI;A - Preparation of Furosemide Conjugated to Serine<br>
[334] The example below describes the attachment of Furosemide to the<br>
side-chain and N-terminus of Polyserine.<br><br>
[335] To a solution of pSer in NMP was added Furosemide-OSu and N-<br>
methyl morpholine (NMM). The reaction was stirred overnight at 70°C. After cooling, reaction was placed in ether and solid was collected by filtration. Solid was<br>
suspended in pH 8 water and purified using ultrafiltration. Product was filtered and dried.<br>
[336] The following examples produce an active agent peptide conjugate<br>
which results in the attachment of mevastatin, prednisone and pravastatin to the carboxylate side-chain and C-terminus of the peptide. In these examples the amino acid peptide is a polyGlu peptide.<br>
[337] Through the use of protection/deprotection techniques, one skilled in<br>
the art would appreciate that the drug could be attached only to the side-chain or only to the C-terminus of the amino acid. Additionally, one skilled in the art would appreciate that the drug could be attached to a single amino acid at both the C-terminus and side-chain, provided the amino acid had the require functional groups, as with Glu.<br>
VT;B - Preparation of PolyGlu Mevastatin (i) AcNGluis(3-mevastatin)2<br>
[338] To polyGlu 15 (0.116 g, 69 umol) in 3 mL dry DMF was added 1 mL<br>
pyridine and acetic anhydride (20 ul, 207 umol). After stirring for 21 hours the mixture was acidified with 6 N HC1 until pH 1 and then cooled to 4°C. The white precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with H2O and then dried under vacuum to yield 11 mg of N-acetylated polyGlms. [339] To N-acetylated polyGlui5 (0.011 g, 7 a mol) in 4.8 mL dry DMF<br>
was added dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.022 g, 108 umol). After stirring twenty minutes the heterogeneous solution was filtered to remove insoluble dicyclohexylurea and combined with mevastatin (0.042 g, 108 urnol) and N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.013 g, 108 nmol). The mixture stirred for 23 h whereupon the reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mL H2O. The solution was extracted twice with 10 mL CHCI3. The aqueous component was adjusted to pH 3 with 1 N HC1 and cooled to 4°C. The resultant white precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with 8 mL H2O. The solid was dissolved in 1 mL H2O and washed with 1 mL CH2C12 and twice with 2 mL EtOAc. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3 with 1 N HC1, cooled to 4°C, the precipitate<br>
isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with 2 mL H2O. The dried conjugate (2<br>
mg) was shown by lH NMR to contain fifteen Glu for every two mevastatin<br>
molecules.<br>

(ii) Glu15(3-mevastatin) (160)<br>
[341] To Glu 15 (0.151 g, 77 pmol) in 3 mL dry DMF was added<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.239 g, 1.159 mmol) and the reaction stirred for 4 hours under argon. The white precipitate was removed and N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.141 g, 1.159 mmol) and mevastatin (0.222 g, 0.569 mmol) were added dissolved in 10 mL CHCl3. The reaction stirred for 21 hours under argon whereupon the precipitate was removed. The solution was concentrated by rotary evaporation and added to 40 mL saturated NaCl (aq) adjusted to pH 8. The homogeneous solution was extracted three times with 20 mL CHCl3 and then ultrafiltered (Amicon regenerated cellulose, YM1, NMWL 1,000). The retentate was dried in vacuum to yield 8 mg of a white residue which showed a ratio of 15 Glutamic acids to one mevastatin by 1H NMR.<br>

[343] To BocGlu(OSu)O-tBu (0.181 g, 453 nmol) and mevastatin (0.177 g,<br>
453 umol) in 40 mL CHCl3 was added N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.055 g, 453 umol). The reaction was heated to reflux for 7 hours under argon and then allowed to stir at 20° C for 8 hours. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the<br>
Residue purified by flash chromatography (8:1-1:1 hexane:EtOAc) to provide the conjugate as a clear film (0.038 g, 11%).<br>

VI:C - Preparation of PolvGIu Prednisone<br>
[345] To GIU15 (0.350 g) in 30 mL of DMF was added bromo-tris-<br>
pyrrolindinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (0.510 g, 1.1 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine (1 mL, 9.3 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 30 min under Ar whereupon N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.067 g, 0.5 mmol) and prednisone (0.489 g, 1.4 mmol) were added. After stirring for 14 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 50 mL H2O and acidified with 6 N HC1 to pH 3. The precipitate was filtered and washed with 30 mL CHCl3. The solid was then dissolved in 70 mL H2O pH 8 and extracted twice with 40 mL CHCl3. The aqueous layer was ultrafiltered (Amicon regenerated cellulose, YM1, NMWL 1,000) with 150 mL H2O and the retentate dried in vacuum to provide a white residue. 1H NMR (DMSO) analysis indicated 4:1 Glu:Prednisone ratio.<br>
VI;D - Preparation of Gh15GIv-Pravastatin)<br>
[346] This example describes the C-terrninus attachment of an alcohol to a<br>
single amino acid (glycine) with subsequent attachment to the C-terminus and side-chain of polyglutamic acid.<br>
[347] To N-Boc-Glycine (0.247 g, 1.41 mmol) in 5 mL dry DMF was<br>
added dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.138 g, 0.67 mmol). After stirring for 1 h under Ar the solution was filtered through glass wool to remove insoluble urea. Pravastatin sodium (0.300 g, 0.67 mmol) was added followed by N-methylmorpholine (147 \il, 1.34 mmol). The mixture was stirred for an additional 23 hours under argon whereupon the solution was filtered through glass wool and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by flash<br>
"ohromatography (30:1-8:1 CHC13:CH3OH) to provide the peracylated statin as a white solid (0.118 g).<br>
[348] Rf = 0.23 (6:1 CHC13:CH3OH); !H NMR (500 MHz, CDC13): 8 5.97<br>
(m, 1H, 5'), 5.89 (m, 1H, 3'), 5.58 (bs, 1H, 6'), 5.40 (bs, 1H, 4'), 5.16 (bs, 1H, 8'), 3.92 (m, 6H, a), 2.69-2.34 (4H, 2, 2, 2\ 2"), 1.43 (s, 18H, t-Bu), 1.09 (d, 3H), 0.87 (m, 6H).<br>
VII General Description of Linker for Attachment to Peptide<br>
[349] For those drugs which are not amenable to attachment through the C-<br>
terminus, N-terminus or side-chain, a linker is required for a stable covalent attachment. For example, direct covalent attachment of an amino acid to a ketone would not produce a stable entity. However, the insertion of a carbonyl between the active agent and the carrier peptide should provide enhanced stability of the Active Agent/Peptide Conjugate. Furthermore, the formation of a ketal using a reagent with the appropriate functionality in the agent provides a link between the active agent and the amino acid conjugate with the desired stability. Another example of this type of linker is the DHP linker. Ideally, these linkers should be removable in vivo. From the below examples one skilled in the art would appreciate how to derive other linkers and attachment functionalities.<br>
[350] Naltrexone-hydrochloride (520 mg, 1.37 mmol) and l-l'-carbonyl-<br>
diimidazole (CDI) (202 mg, 1.25 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5 mL). The reaction was then allowed to stir for 1 hour at room temperature under argon. Glutamic acid-lysine copolymer (GlunLysm , 2.5 mmol of free lysine sidechains*) was then added as a suspension in 15 mL DMF, and the reaction allowed to continue stirring under argon at room temperature for 2 days. The solvent, DMF, was then removed by rotary evaporation under high vacuum, leaving a green solid. The solid was dissolved in water (20 mL), and the aqueous solution filtered/concentrated using ultrafiltration (1000 mw cutoff) to remove small molecular weight starting materials and byproducts. Two aliquots of water (10 mL each) were added and the solution filtered/concentrated after each addition to a final volume of ~2 mL. The remaining solution was freed of solvent by rotary evaporation and the resulting solid dried over night in a vacuum chamber at room temperature. This afforded the carbamate conjugate (642 mg, 43% yield assuming saturation of available lysine sidechains) with an approximate loading of 1:4 (naltrexone/amino acid residue) as estimated by ^-NMR.<br>
[351] 1H NMR (360 MHz, DMSO-d6): 5 6.78 and 6.61 (bs, 1H each,<br>
naltrexone-aromatic); 2.74 (bs, ~8H, ?-Glu); 2.20 (bs, -8H, ß-Glu), 0.50 (bs, 2H, naltrexone-cyclopropyl) and 0.16 (bs, 2H, naltrexone-cyclopropyl). [352] (* mmol of Lysine sidechains is estimated based on a 1:1 Glu/Lys<br>
ratio as previously determined by NMR. This copolymer was prepared from Lys(Boc)-NCA and Glu(OtBu)-NCA using standard NCA polymerization methods. The resulting polymer (1.00 g, 2.5 mmol Lys) was deprotected using 4N HC1 in Dioxane)<br>
[353] CDI (0.522 g, 3.2 mmol) was dissolved at room temperature in 20<br>
mL of dry methylene chloride in a flask charged with argon. The naltrexone (1.00 g, 2.9 mmol) dissolved in mehtylene chloride (20 mL) was then added drop wise to the CDI solution. An additional 10 mL of methylene chloride was used to rinse the vessel that had contained the naltrexone, and the wash added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was heated to 50°C, and allowed to stir over night under argon at a temperature between 40 and 50°C. The solvent was then removed by rotary evaporation under high vacuum. 1H-NMR indicated that the tacky solid contained a mixture of imidazole, the adduct 1 and unreacted starting materials. Imidazole and compound 1 were the dominant components.<br>
[354] 1H NMR (360 MHz, dg-DMSO): 5 8.27 (bm, 1H, 1); 7.74 (bs, 2 H,<br>
imidazole); 7.53 (t, 1H, 1); 7.24 (bs, 1H, imidazole); 7.14 (bm, 1H, 1); 6.95 (d, 1H, 1) and 6.73 (d, 1H, 1).<br>
[355] The solid from step 1 was dissolved in anhydrous N-<br>
methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), and solid Sern (0.51 g, 5.9 mmol) added to the solution. The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C under argon, and allowed to stir under argon, over night at a temperature between 50 and 60°C. The organic solution was then diluted into 100 mL of water. Precipitate formed immediately, and the solid (A) was collected by centrifuge, and the pellets then dried over night in a vacuum chamber. The water in the supernatant was removed by rotary evaporation, and the NMP solution that remained was diluted into ether (100 mL). Again, precipitate formed immediately. This solid (B) was collected by filtration and then dried over night in a vacuum chamber. Both solids were hygroscopic and appeared similar in composition by TLC (3:1 CHCI3/CH3OH). Therefore, solids A and B were combined and dissolved/suspended in -50 mL water. Ultrafiltration (1000 mw cutoff) was used to remove impurities such as unreacted naltrexone and imidazole, leaving the Sern and the naltrexone conjugate, Sern.m [Ser(Nal)]m. The suspended material was washed with 5 aliquots of water (10 mL each), and then pelletted by centrifugation. The polymer conjugate was then dried over night in a vacuum chamber. This afforded 80 mg (-5% yield) of material with an estimated loading of 1:19 naltrexone/serine (based on 1H-NMR).<br>
[356] 1H NMR (360 MHz, DMSO-d6): 5 5.03 (bs, ~19H, a-Ser); 0.59 (bs,<br>
2H, naltrexone-cyclopropyl) and 0.34 (bs, 2H, naltrexone-cyclopropyl).<br>
(i) Preparation of 3-Methyl Naltrexone<br>
[357] Naltrexone (6.0 g, 16.5 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL distilled<br>
water. The solution was titrated with IN NaOH to a final pH of 11.8. In the course of the titration, neutral naltrexone precipitated from solution and then went back into solution. Upon reaching pH 11.8, the solvent was removed by rotary-evaporation under high vacuum, and the resulting solid stored under vacuum over night at room temperature. The solid was then suspended/dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and allowed to stir at room temperature under argon. A solution of iodomethane (2.1 mg, 33 mmol) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise over the course 30 minutes. The reaction was then allowed to stir an additional 3 hours at room temperature under argon. The solvent was then removed by rotary-evaporation under reduced pressure. The residual solid was then dissolved in 40 mL of CHC13 and the organic solution washed with 30 mL of saturated NaCl, 3 x 30 mL of IN NaOH and finally twice more with 30 mL saturated aqueous NaCl. The organic solution was collected and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent by rotary-evaporation and drying over night under vacuum afforded pure<br>

[358] !H NMR (360 MHz, CDC13): 5 6.677 (d, 1H, naltrexone aromatic),<br>

(20 mL) was added D-a-glucose (2.02 g, 11.2 mmol), triflic acid (0.05 mL, 0.62 mmol), and CuSO4 (1-00 g). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperatures for 4 days. Reaction was then filtered, neutralized with saturated NaHCO3 and filtered again. Dioxane and water were removed and the residue was taken up in CHCI3 and extracted with water (3 x lOOmL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Crude product was purified over silica gel (0-10% MeOH in CHCI3) to obtain the ketal conjugate (0.010 g) in a 1:1 mixture with free methyl naltrexone.

VIII In Vitro Performance Studies of Various Active Agents and Amino Acids Conjugates<br>
VIII:A - Materials and Methods of the In Vitro Performance Studies for Peptide Conjugated Active Agents Testing<br>
[365] Esterase (EC 3.1.1.1; from porcine liver), lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; from<br>
porcine pancreas), amidase (EC 3.5.1.4; from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), protease (EC 3.4.24.31; type XIV, bacterial from Streptomyces griseus; also known as pronase), pancreatin (EC 232-468-9; from porcine pancreas), pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1; from porcine stomach mucosa), tris-HCl, methimazole were all purchased from Sigma. Buffers used in the digestive assays were prepared as follows: reducing buffer [110mM sodium chloride, NaCl, 50mM methimazole, 40mM tris-HCl, adjust pH to 8.4 with IN sodium hydroxide, NaOH], Intestinal Simulator (IS) buffer [lOOmM monobasic potassium phosphate, adjust pH to 7.5 with IN NaOH], Gastric Simulator (GS) buffer [69mM NaCl, adjust pH to 1.2 with HC1], esterase buffer<br>
[10mM borate buffer pH to 8 with NaOH], lipase and amidase buffer [100mM monobasic potassium phosphate pH to 7.5 with NaOH].<br>
[366] The proteolytic release of the active agent from the peptide<br>
conjugates was determined in different assays. Peptide conjugates were shaken at 37°C in the presence of pronase, pancreatin, esterase, lipase, or amidase for 24 hours or pepsin for 4 hours. Stock solutions of each conjugate (0.5-2.0 mg/mL) and enzymes (protease, reducing buffer, 6mg/mL; pancreatin, IS buffer, 20 mg/mL; pepsin, GS buffer, 6.40 mg/mL; esterase, esterase buffer, 1.02 mg/mL; lipase, lipase buffer, 0.10 mg/mL; amidase, amidase buffer, 0.10 µl/mL) were prepared. For protease, pancreatin, and pepsin digestion, conjugate and enzyme were diluted 2-fold in the assay in a final volume of 2 mL. After the indicated incubation time for each assay, 2 mL of acetonitrile, MeCN, containing 1% of phosphoric acid, H3PO4, was added to each sample to stop digestion, and samples were centrifuged to remove gross particulate matter. Any remaining paniculate was filtered with a 0.2 urn nylon syringe filter (Whatman) prior to HPLC analysis.<br>
[367] Enzyme digested conjugates were analyzed for the presence of<br>
unconjugated active agent by reversed phase HPLC (C18, 4.6 x 250mm, 5µm, 300A) using the following conditions: mobile phase - Lotus buffer (4.5 mL of H3PO4, 8.8 mL triethylamine, pH = 3.5)/ THF/ MeCN [68.6/4.5/26.9] or TBA-phosphate buffer (lOmM tetrabutyl ammonium chloride, lOmM monobasic sodium phosphate, pH = 6.0)/ MeCN [65/35]; injection volume - 20 µl; flow rate - 1 mL/min; UV - 230 nm. Retention times of active agent were determined from standards in a calibration curve which was used to calculate the concentrations of enzymatically released active agent.<br>
VIII:B -In Vitro Performance Studies Results<br>
[368] The Table 8 below depicts active agent conjugates that were tested<br>
with the stomach, inestine, and pronase simulator.<br>
VIII;C - Caco-2 Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells Studies<br>
[369] Monolayers of Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells are<br>
increasingly being used to predict the absorption of orally delivered drugs. The Caco-2 transwell system and other in vitro assays were used to evaluate the performance of Polythroid. Findings indicated that Polythroid enhance oral delivery of thyroid hormones for the treatment of hypothyroid disorders.<br>
(i) Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell assay<br>
[370] Caco-2 cells were grown on the surface of collagen coated wells in a<br>
24 well format to form confluent monolayers that represent small segments of the intestine. The wells were removable and contain a top chamber representing the apical side (facing the lumen of the intestine) and a bottom chamber representing the basolateral side (site of serosal drug absorption). The integrity of the epithelial barrier was monitored by testing the electrical resistance across the monolayer.<br>
Absorption of drugs was studied by adding sample to the apical side and assaying the concentration of the drug in the basolateral chamber following incubation.<br>
(ii) Intestinal epithelial cell proteases digest Polythroid<br>
[371] Polythroid is a synthetic polymer of glutamic acid with T4 and T3<br>
covalently attached by a peptide bond linkage. The polymer is the delivery vehicle for the thyroid hormones and is not designed to cross the intestinal barrier itself. Rather, it was designed to release T4 and T3 in a time dependent manner. Release of the thyroid hormones is dependent on the enzymatic cleavage of the glutamic acid polymer. In theory, this will result from Polythroid encountering proteolytic enzymes as it descends the intestinal tract. Proteins are digested into small peptides by gastric pepsin and pancreatic enzymes secreted into the small intestine. Intestinal epithelial cells then function to further breakdown the small peptides. They accomplish this with proteolytic enzymes referred to as brush border proteases that are attached to the cell surface.<br>
[372] Monitoring the effect of brush border peptidases on Polythroid<br>
required development of an assay to specifically distinguish Polythroid from polyglutamic acid and the thyroid hormones. Therefore, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that specifically recognizes Polythroid. The assay employs antibodies against the glutamic acid polymer to capture Polythroid and antibodies to T4 or T3 to detect the presence of Polythroid. The assay has no cross-reactivity with polyglutamic acid or the thyroid hormones themselves. Consequently, proteolytic degradation of Polythroid results in T4 and T3 release from the polymer and a corresponding decrease in ELISA reactivity. The Polythroid specific ELISA can, therefore, be used to monitor the breakdown of Polythroid. [373] The Polythroid specific assay was used to analyze in situ digestion of<br>
Polythroid in Caco-2 cell cultures. Different concentrations of Polythroid were added to the apical side of Caco-2 cells and incubated for 4 hours in PBS at 37°C (n = 4). The apical side Polythroid concentration was measured by Polythroid specific ELISA before and after the 4 hour incubation (Figure 2). At the relatively high concentration of 100 micrograms, 26% of Polythroid was degraded, whereas at a 10-<br>
-'fold lower concentration 84% of the Polythroid was degraded. When a concentration of 0.5 micrograms was added (closer to the concentrations that would be encountered by the intestine in a normal human dose) the amount of Polythroid remaining after 4 hours of incubation was below the limit of detection for the ELIS A (10 ng) indicating essentially complete digestion. The loss of Polymer in the apical chamber was not due to absorption of Polythroid across the monolayer since the basolateral chamber contained no detectable Polythroid in any of the experiments (see below). We cannot rule out cellular uptake of Polythroid, however, enzymatic digestion is likely to account for most, if not all, of the decrease in Polythroid concentration on the apical side. At the higher concentrations, it would be difficult for cellular uptake to account for such a large difference in the remaining Polythroid.<br>
(iii) PolyT4 enhances absorption of T4 across Caco-2 monolayers<br>
[374] Absorption of T4 was monitored in the Caco-2 transwell system (n =<br>
4). PolyT4 (10 micrograms) was added to the apical side of the transwells. T4 was added to the apical side at a concentration equal to the T4 content of PolyT4. A commercial ELIS A for T4 was used to determine the level of T4 in the basolateral chamber following incubation for 4 hours at 37°C (Figure 3). A significantly higher amount of T4 was absorbed from PolyT4 as compared to CaCo-2 cells incubated with the amount of T4 equivalent to that contained in the polymer.<br>
(iv) Polythroid Does Not Cross Caco-2 Monolayers<br>
[375] In order to determine if Polythroid itself crosses the Caco-2<br>
monolayer we used the Polythroid specific ELISA to measure the amount of polymer in the basolateral chamber after incubation with Polythroid at a high concentration (100 micrograms). After 4 hours incubation, samples (n = 4) from the basolateral side showed no reactivity in the ELISA (Figure 4). The limit of detection for Polythroid is 10 ng, therefore, less than 1/10,000 of the Polythroid was absorbed. In conclusion, within the limits of ELISA detection, Polythroid does not cross the Caco-2 monolayer.<br>
(v) Conclusions and Summary<br>
[376] The following discussion recites in vitro performance studies<br>
conducted with regard to specific embodiments of the present invention. Although these performance studies describe specific embodiments of the present invention, it is not limited to these embodiments. Alternative embodiments and modifications which would still be encompassed by the invention may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. Therefore, this invention is intended to cover any alternative embodiments, modifications or equivalents which may be within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
[377] The in vitro performance assays provide the following conclusions.<br>
Active agents are released from peptide conjugates by pancreatic and intestinal cell proteases. T4 and T3 released from Polythroid are absorbed across intestinal monolayers. PolyT4 enhances absorption of T4 across intestinal epithelium in vitro. Polythroid itself does not cross the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro. The kinetics of time release may be controlled by the method of Polythroid synthesis. [378] Data from the in vitro intestinal epithelial model suggests that<br>
attachment of T4 to polymers of glutamic acid may enhance absorption of the thyroid hormones, perhaps by providing a second mechanism of uptake and/or enhancing solubility of the hormones. Polythroid itself does not cross the intestinal epithelial barrier in the in vitro Caco-2 model. Thus, any concerns about systemic effects of the polymer are minimized since it should not be absorbed into the bloodstream.<br>
IX: In Vivo Performance Studies of Various Active Agents and Amino Acids Conjugates<br>
IX:A - In Vivo Performance Studies of Polymer-Drug Conjugates<br>
[379] Pharmacokinetics of various parent drugs and amino acid polymer<br>
drug conjugates containing an equivalent dose were tested in vivo by oral gavage of female Sprague Dawley rats. Doses (mg/kg) were given as solutions in water or sodium bicarbonate buffer. Serum was collected under anesthesia by jugular<br>
venipuncture for the first bleed and cardiac puncture for the second bleed. Collections were taken from 5 animals/set predose (jugular) and at 6 hours (cardiac); 1 hour (jugular) and 9 hours (cardiac); and 3 hours (jugular) and 12 hours (cardiac). Serum drug levels were determined by LC/MS/MS or ELIS A.<br>
[380] Study 6856-120 shows the serum concentration levels of Furosemide<br>
vs. PolySer (Furosemide) conjugate containing an equivalent amount of Furosemide. Furosemide had an (AUC) of 21,174 as compared to the conjugate which had an AUC of 8,269 (39.1 % relative to the parent drug). The figure above shows the serum concentration curves of the parent drug vs. PolySer (Furosemide) conjugate. The 9 hour serum level of the PolySer(Furosemide) conjugate was 95.5% of its 3 hour level, whereas the 9 hour serum level of the parent drug was only 59.8% of its 3 hour level. This and the relative flatness of the PolySer (Furosemide) conjugate serum concentration curve between 3 and 9 hours, as compared to that of the curve for the parent drug, illustrate sustained release by the PolySer (Furosemide) conjugate.<br>
[382] The relative percent of area under the serum concentration curves<br>
(AUCs) of various amino acid polymer drug conjugates compared to parent drug AUCs is shown in Table 9. The relative percents ranged from 9.4% to 42.6% and<br>
varied depending on the amino acid content of the polymer drug conjugate. These examples illustrate the ability to covalently bond various drugs to polymers of various amino acids and affect release and absorption of the bound drug into the sera when given as an oral dose to an animal.<br>
IX In vitro and In vivo performance of Polvserine-Naltrexone conjugate (carbonate linked)<br>
X: A - In Vivo performance of Polvserine-Naltrexone conjugate (rat model)<br>
(Lot no. BB-272,1:6 naltrexone:serine ratio)<br>
[383] Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates were tested in male Sprague<br>
Dawley rats (~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in gelatin capsules containing purified dry powder polyserine-naltrexone conjugates or naltrexone. No excipients were added to the capsules.<br>
[384] Content of naltrexone in the PolySerine-Naltrexone conjugate was<br>
estimated to be 30% as based on the 1:6 ratio of naltrexone:serine determined by NMR. Polyserine-naltrexone conjugate was given to four rats at a dose of 12 mg which contained 3.6 mg of naltrexone. Doses of naltrexone (3.6 mg) equivalent to the naltrexone content of the conjugate were also given to four rats. Capsules were delivered orally to rats at time-zero using a capsule dosing syringe. Serum was collected from rats 2,4, 6, 9, and 12 hours after capsule delivery. Serum naltrexone concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (Nalbuphine, product #102819, Neogen Corporation, Lansing MI).<br>
Table 10. Serum Concentrations (ng/rnL) of Individual Rats Fed; PolySerine-Naltrexone Conjugate vs. Naltrexone -<br>
[385] Serum levels of individual animals are shown in Table 10. Mean<br>
serum levels are shown in Table 11. As shown in the figure above, serum levels spiked earlier for naltrexone (2 hours) than for the drug administered as a polyserine-naltrexone conjugate (4 hours). Serum levels of naltrexone for the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate remained elevated considerably longer than for naltrexone. Additionally, the peak level was significantly lower for the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate. It should be noted that the 2 hour time point was the first measurement of naltrexone serum levels. Since this was the peak level measured for naltexone it can not be determined whether or not levels peaked at a higher concentration earlier. Consequently, it was not possible to accurately determine the Ctnax or area under serum concentration curve (AUC) for naltrexone in this experiment.<br>
X:B - In Vivo performance of PoIySerine-Naltrexone conjugate<br>
(Lot no. BB-301,1:10 naltrexonerserine ratio)<br>
[386] Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates were tested in Sprague-dawley rats<br>
(~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in gelatin capsules containing purified dry powder polyserine-naltrexone conjugates or naltrexone. No excipients were added to the capsules.<br>
[387] Content of naltrexone in the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate BB-272<br>
was estimated to be 30% as based on the 1:6 ratio of naltrexone:serine determined by NMR. Polyserine-naltrexone conjugate was given to five rats at a dose of 12.9 mg which contained 3.6 mg of naltrexone. Doses equivalent to the naltrexone contained in the batch of polyserine-naltrexone (BB-301) were also given to five rats. Additionally, half the equivalent dose (1.8 mg) was given at time-zero, followed by a second half-dose at 6.5 hours to five rats.<br>
[388] Capsules were delivered orally to rats at time-zero using a capsule<br>
delivery syringe. Serum was collected at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15 and 24 hours after capsule delivery for the polyserine-naltrexone (BB-301) and equivalent naltrexone dosed rats. Serum was collected at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 11.5, 14.5 and 24 hours after capsule delivery for rats dosed with half-equivalent doses at 0 and 6.5 hours. Serum naltrexone concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (Nalbuphine, product #102819, Neogen Corporation, Lansing MI).<br>
[389] Serum levels of individual animals are shown in Table 12. Mean<br>
serum levels are shown in Table 13. As shown in the figure above, naltrexone serum levels spiked earlier (0.5 hours) for naltrexone than for the drug administed as a polyserine-naltexone conjugate (5 hours). Serum levels of naltrexone for the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate remained elevated considerably longer (&gt; 12 hours) than for the monomeric naltrexone control (
"concentration (Cmax) was significantly lower for the conjugated naltrexone (Table 14). Further, the mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) was significantly longer for the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate (Table 14). The mean AUC of the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate was approximately 75% of the naltrexone mean AUC (Table 5). Statistically the mean AUCs were not significantly different (P
X:C - In Situ Performance of Polvserine-Naltrexone - Caco-2 Cell Digestion<br>
[390] Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates BB-272 and BB-301 were<br>
incubated with monolayers of Caco-2 cells for 4 hours in phosphate buffered saline. Buffer was removed from the monlayers and concentrated on SP-18 columns. Concentrated samples were analyzed for the presence of naltexone by reverse phase HPLC. Each Polyserine-naltrexone conjugate showed significant release of free naltrexone from the polymer conjugate in three separate samples. In conclusion, Caco-2 cellular enzymes affected release of naltrexone from Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates BB-272 and BB-301. Release of carbonate linked drug from a conjugate by intestinal cellular enzymes affords a mechanism for drug absorption following oral administration.<br>
X:D - Treatment of Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates with intestinal enzymes<br>
[391] Polyserine-naltrexone (BB-272 and BB-301) were treated with<br>
enzymes found in the stomach and lumen of the small intestines. The enzymes<br>
1Htested, which included pepsin, pancreatic lipase, and pancreatin were ineffective in releasing naltrexone from the polyserine-naltrexone conjugates. Other enzymes, including protease and amidase, also did not affect drug release. These results suggest that polyserine-naltrexone is resistant to enzymes found in the stomach and lumen of the intestine.<br>
X:E - Conclusion<br>
[392] In conclusion, conjugation of naltrexone to a polymer of serine via<br>
carbonate linkage comprised a pharmaceutical composition that afforded extended release when administered orally. The said conjugates were resistant to a number of enzymes found in the luminal fluids of the intestinal tract. In contrast, incubation of the compositions with Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells affected release of naltrexone. In a specific embodiment of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a drug covalently bound to a carrier that are resistant to luminal enzymes and depend on intestinal cell associated enzymes for drug release afford extended release characteristics to the bound drug.<br>
XI. In vivo performance of polyglutamic acid-azidothymidine (AZT) conjugate (ester linked)<br>
XI:A - In vivo performance of polyglutamic acid-azidothymidine (AZT) conjugate<br>
(lot no. TM-113,41% AZT content)<br>
[393] Polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugates were tested in male Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats (~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in sodium bicarbonate solution containing polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugates or AZT. [394] Content of AZT in the conjugate TM-113 was estimated to be 41 % as<br>
based on UV spectrophotometric assay. Polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugate was given to five rats at a dose containing 15 mg/kg of AZT. Doses of AZT equivalent to the AZT contained in polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-113) were also given to five rats.<br>
[395] Doses were delivered orally to rats at time-zero using an intragastric<br>
delivery syringe. Plasma was collected at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 24 hours after delivery of polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-113) and equivalent AZT dosed rats. Plasma AZT concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (AZT ELISA, Product #400110, Neogen Corporation, Lexington, KY).<br>
[396] Plasma levels of individual animals are shown in Table 15. Mean<br>
plasma levels are shown in Table 16. As shown the figure above, AZT plasma levels spiked at 0.5 hours and rapidly droped by 1.5 hours, whereas levels of AZT for the polyglutamic acid-AZT where significantly lower at 0.5 hours and did not drop off rapidly by 0.5 hours. Plasma levels of AZT for the polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugate remained elevated longer (&gt; 3 hours) than for the monomeric AZT control<br>

XI:B - In vivo performance of polyglutamic acid-azidothymidine (AZT) conjugate (rat model)<br>
(lot no. TM-248,43% AZT content)<br>
[397] Polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugates were tested in male Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats (~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in sodium bicarbonate solution containing polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugates or AZT. [398] Content of AZT in the conjugate TM-248 was estimated to be 43 %<br>
as based on UV spectrophotometric assay. Polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugate was given to five rats at a dose containing 7.5 mg/kg of AZT. Doses of AZT equivalent to the AZT contained in polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-248) were also given to five rats.<br>
[399] Doses were delivered orally to rats at time-zero using an oral gavage<br>
syringe. Plasma was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 hours after delivery of polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-248) and equivalent AZT dosed rats. Plasma AZT concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (AZT ELISA, Product #400110, Neogen Corporation, Lexington, KY).<br>
[400] Plasma levels of individual animals are shown in Table 18. Mean<br>
plasma levels are shown in Table 19. As shown the figure above, AZT plasma levels spiked at 0.5 hours and rapidly dropped by 1 hour, whereas levels of AZT for the polyglutamic acid-AZT remained elevated until 4 hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 20. Cmax of polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-248) was increased by 149% over AZT. The mean AUC of polyglutamic acid-AZT (TM-248) was increased 598% over AZT. Further, the mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) was substantially longer for the polyglutamic acid-AZT conjugate. This example clearly illustrates that both enhanced absorption and sustained release can be afforded to AZT by covalent attachment to a polymer of glutamic acid.<br>

Interleukin-12<br>
[838] Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by phagocytic<br>
cells, professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and skin Langerhans cells, and B cells. Interleukin-12 production is induced by bacteria, intracellular pathogens, fungi, viruses, or their products in a T-cell-independent pathway or a T-cell-dependent pathway, the latter mediated through CD40 ligand-CD40 interaction. Interleukin-12 is produced rapidly after infection and acts as a proinflammatory cytokine eliciting production of interferon gamma, by T and natural killer cells, which activates phagocytic cells. The production of interleukin-12 is strictly regulated by positive and negative feedback mechanisms. If interleukin-12 and interleukin-12-induced interferon gamma are present during early T-cell expansion in response to antigen, T-helper type-1 cell generation is favored and generation of T-helper type-2 cells is inhibited. Thus interleukin-12 is also a potent immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes T-helper type-1 differentiation and is instrumental in the T-helper type-1-dependent resistance to infections by bacteria, intracellular parasites, fungi, and certain viruses. By inhibiting T-helper type-2 cell response, interleukin-12 has a suppressive effect on allergic reactions; by promoting T-helper type-1 responses it participates in the immunopathology responsible for several organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Viruses inducing a permanent or transient immunodepression, such as HIV and measles, may act, in part, by<br>
suppressing interleukin-12 production. Because of its ability to enhance resistance to several infectious diseases and to act as an adjuvant in vaccination, and because of its powerful antitumor effect in vivo, interleukin-12 is currently in clinical trials in cancer patients and HIV-infected patients, and it is being considered for therapeutic use in other diseases. The carrier peptide attached to proteins are typically formed using typical peptide chemistry.<br>
