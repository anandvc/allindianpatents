Indole-3-Carboxamides as Glucokinase (GK). Activators<br>
[0001] Glucokinase (GK) is one of four hexokinases that are found in mammals [Colowick, S.P., in The Enzymes, Vol. 9 (P. Boyer, ed.) Academic Press, New â€¢<br>
. York, NY, pages 1-48, 1973]. The hexokinases catalyze the first step in the metabolism of glucose, i.e., the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase has a limited cellular distribution, being found principally in pancreatic P-cells and liver parenchymal cells. In addition, GK is a rate-controlling enzyme for glucose metabolism in these two cell types that are known to play critical roles in whole-body glucose homeostasis [Chipkin, S.R., Kelly, K.L., and Ruderman, N.B. in Joslin's Diabetes (C.R. Khan and G.C. Wier, eds.), Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, PA, pages 97-115, 1994]. The concentration of glucose at which GK demonstrates half-maximal activity is approximately 8 raM. The other three hexokinases are saturated with glucose at much lower concentrations (
 <br>
[0002] The finding that type II maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY-2) is caused by loss of function mutations in the GK gene suggests that GK also functions as a glucose sensor in humans (Liang, Y., Kesavan, P., Wang, L. et al., Biochem. J. 309, 167-173, 1995). Additional evidence supporting an important role for GK in the regulation of glucose metabolism in humans was provided by the identification of patients that express a mutant form of GK with increased enzymatic activity. These patients exhibit a fasting hypoglycemia associated with an inappropriately elevated level of plasma insulin (Glaser, B.5 Kesavan, P., Heyman, M. et al., New England! Med. 338, 226-230, 1998). While mutations of the GK gene are not found in the majority of patients with type II diabetes, compounds that activate GK, and thereby increase the sensitivity of the GK sensor system, will still be useful in the treatment of the hyperglycemia characteristic of all type II diabetes. Glucokinase activators will increase the flux of glucose metabolism in p-cells and hepatocytes, which will be coupled to increased insulin secretion. Such agents would be useful for treating type II diabetes.<br>

This reaction can be carried out by any conventional means of N-alkylation of an indole. The preferred conditions for N-alkylation of the 3-trifluoroacetylindole compound of formula III include deprotonation of the indole-NH with excess potassium carbonate in 'N,N-dimethylfonnamide followed by treatment with the desired alkyl halide and then subsequent heating of the reaction mixture at high temperatures, from 60Â°C to 75Â°C being preferred.<br><br>
[038] The N-alkylated 3-trifluoroacetylindole compound of formula V can then be converted to the N-alkylated indole-3-carboxylic acid compound of formula VI. The compound of formula V readily undergoes a haloform cleavage reaction with 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide under refluxing conditions to afford the desired indole-3-carboxylic acid compound of formula VI {J, Chem. Soc. 1954, 1651-1653; Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1970, 2, 297-303).<br>
[039] The compound of formula VI is then condensed with the compound of formula VII via conventional peptide coupling to produce the desired compound of formula I. In carrying out this reaction, any conventional method of condensing a primary amine with a carboxylic acid can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[040]   The indoles of formula II wherein R1 is chloro [6-chloroindole], fluoro [6-fluoroindole], bromo [6-bromoindole], nitro [6-nitroindole], amino [6-aminoindole], cyano [6-cyanoindole], methyl [6-methylindole], trifluoromethyl [6-(trifluoro~methyl)indole], hydroxy [6-hydroxyindole], methoxy [6-methoxyindole], and benzyloxy [6-benxyloxyindole] are commercially available.<br>
[041] The indoles of formula II wherein R1 is trifluoromethoxy, methylthio, and iodo can be prepared from those skilled in the art by using synthetic transformations reported in the chemical literature: (a) 6-(trifluoromethoxy)indole, J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41(10), 1598-1612; (b) 6-<methylthio pct int. appl. wo al and heterocycles></methylthio>
[042] The indoles of formula II wherein R1 is amino and hydroxy must be protected before carrying out the Reaction Scheme. The amino group and hydroxy group can be protected with any conventional acid removable group. The protecting groups are then removed from the amine and hydroxy groups after the step of coupling the compound of formula VI with the amine of formula VII to produce the desired compounds of formula L<br>
[043] Once the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is methyithio are available, they can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein Rl is<br><br>
methylsulfinyl. Any conventional method of oxidizing a methylthio substituent to a methylsulfinyl substituent (sulfoxide) can be utilized to effect this conversion. On the otherhand, if it is desired to produce compounds of formula I wherein R1 is methylsulfonyl,.the compounds of formula I wherein R1 is methylthio can also be used as starting materials. Any conventional method of oxidizing a methylthio substituent to methylsulfonyl substituent can be utilized to effect, this conversion.<br>
[044] The amino heteroaromatic compounds of formula VII are commercially available, or are known in the chemical literature, or can be prepared from those skilled in the art by using adaptations of standard synthetic transformations reported in the chemical literature. To produce the compounds of formula I, the synthetic conversions described herein to produce the desired R3 substituents can take place either before or after the compounds of formula VII are converted to the compounds of formula I.<br>
[045] For example, the amino heteroaromatic compounds of formula VII, wherein one of the substitutions is -(CH2)nCOOR and where n = 0 or 1 and R is hydrogen or lower alkyl, can be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acids -(CH2)nCOOR5 (n = 0 and R5 is hydrogen). Any conventional carbon homologation method can be utilized to convert a lower carboxylic acid to its higher homologs (see for example, Skeean, R. W.; Goel, O. P. Synthesis, 1990, 628), which in turn can then can be converted to the corresponding lower alkyl esters using any conventional esterification methods. The amino heteroaromatic compounds of formula VII, wherein one of the substitutions is -(CH2)nC(=0)NHR5 and where n = 0 or 1 and R5 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, can in turn be made by the above mentioned carboxylic acids. Any conventional means of converting carboxylic acids to the corresponding amides may be utilized to effect this conversion. In turn, the lower alkyl amides can be converted to the corresponding amines of formula VII, wherein one of the substitutions is -(CH2)nNHR5 and where n=l, by any conventional amide reduction method. The amino heteroaromatic compounds of formula VII, wherein one of the claimed substitutions is -(CH2)nOR5 and where n = 1, can be prepared from the above said corresponding lower alkyl esters. The lower alkyl esters can be converted to the corresponding alcohols using any conventional ester reduction method.<br><br>
[046] Such amines and alcohols described above would have to be selectively protected before carrying out the condensation step. The amino group and alcohol group can be protected with any conventional acid removable group. The protecting groups are then removed from the amine and alcohol groups after the coupling step to produce the desired compounds of formula I.<br>
(047J If it is desired to produce the amino heteroaromatic compounds of formula VII wherein one of the substituents is cyano or the compound of formula I wherein one of the substituents on the five- or six-membered heteroaromatic ring is cyano, then the corresponding halogen (especially bromo) can be utilized as the starting material. Any conventional method of converting a halogen to a cyanide may be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>

Biological Activity Examples<br>
Biological Activity Example A:       In Vitro Glucokinase Activity<br>
[0176] Glucokinase In Vitro Assay Protocol: Glucokinase (GK) was assayed by coupling the production of glucose-6-phosphate to the generation of NADH with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, 075-1 kunits/mg; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides as the coupling enzyme (Scheme 2).<br><br>
[0177] Recombinant human liver GK1 was expressed in Â£. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-GK) [Liang et aL, 1995] and was purified by chromatography over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column using the procedure provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic properties of native GK and GST-GK are essentially identical (Liang et al., 1995; NeetetaL, 1990).<br>
[0178] The assay was conducted at 25Â°C in a flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plate from Costar (Cambridge, MA) with a final incubation volume of 120pL. The incubation mixture contained the following: 25 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.1), 25 mM KC1, 5 mM D-glucose, ImM ATP, 1.8 mM NAD, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 nM sorbitol-6-phosphate3 1 mM dithiothreitol, test drug or 10% DMSO, 1.8 unit/ml G6PDH, and GK (see below). All organic reagents were &gt;98% pure and were from Boehringer Mannheim with the exceptions of D-glucose and Hepes which were from Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and were added to the incubation mixture minus GST-GK in a volume of 12jiL to yield a final DMSO concentration of 10%. This mix was pre-incubated in the temperature controlled chamber of a SPECTRAmax 250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corporation,  Sunnyvale,  CA) for   10<br><br>
minutes to allow temperature equilibrium and then the reaction was started by the addition of 20|iL GST-GK.<br>
[0179] After addition of enzyme, the increase in optical density (OD) at 340nm was monitored over a 10 minute incubation period as a measure of GK activity. Sufficient GST-GK was added to produce an increase in OD340 of 0.08 to 0.1 units over the 10 minute incubation period in wells containing 10% DMSO but no test compound. Preliminary experiments established that the GK reaction was linear over this period of time even in the presence of activators that produced a 5-fold increase in GK activity. The GK activity in control wells was compared with the activity in wells containing test GK activators. The concentration of activator that produced a 50% increase in the activity of GK was calculated and expressed as SCi.5, the stimulatory concentration of activator required to activate the GK en2yme by 50%. All of the compounds described in the Examples had an SCu less than or equal to IOOJIM.<br>
