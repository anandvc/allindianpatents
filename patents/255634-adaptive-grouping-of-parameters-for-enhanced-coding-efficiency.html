				<td>Adaptive Grouping of Parameters for Enhanced Coding<br>
Efficiency<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to lossless encoding of<br>
parameters, and, in particular, to the generation and use<br>
of an encoding rule for efficient compression of<br>
parameters.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction<br>
technique is becoming more and more important. This may be<br>
due to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques<br>
such as the well-known mp3 technique have made it possible<br>
to distribute audio records via the Internet or other<br>
transmission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3<br>
coding technique has become so famous because of the fact<br>
that it allows distribution of all the records in a stereo<br>
format, i.e., a digital representation of the audio record<br>
including a first or left stereo channel and a second or<br>
right stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround<br>
technique has been developed. A recommended multi-channel-<br>
surround representation includes, in addition to the two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br>
front channels and two surround channels. Generally, five<br>
transmission channels are required. In a playback<br>
environment, at least five speakers at five decent places<br>
are needed to get an optimum sweet spot in a certain<br>
distance of the five well-placed loudspeakers.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. Such techniques are called joint stereo<br>
techniques. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 9, which<br>
shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a device<br>
implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural cue<br>
coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an<br>
input - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and<br>
outputs at least a single carrier channel and parametric<br>
data. The parametric data are defined such that, in a<br>
decoder, an approximation of an original channel (CH1, CH2,<br>
... CHn) can be calculated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc., which<br>
provide a comparatively fine representation of the<br>
underlying signal, while the parametric data do not include<br>
such samples of spectral coefficients but include control<br>
parameters for controlling a certain reconstruction<br>
algorithm such as weighting by multiplication, time<br>
shifting, frequency shifting, phase shifting, etc. . The<br>
parametric data, therefore, include only a comparatively<br>
coarse representation of the signal or the associated<br>
channel. Stated in numbers, the amount of data required by<br>
a carrier channel will be in the range of 60 - 70 kbit/s,<br>
while the amount of data required by parametric side<br>
information for one channel will typically be in the range<br>
of 1,5 - 2,5 kbit/s. An example for parametric data are the<br>
well-known scale factors, intensity stereo information or<br>
binaural cue parameters as will be described below.<br>
The BCC Technique is for example described in the AES<br>
convention paper 5574, "Binaural Cue Coding applied to<br>
Stereo and Multi-Channel Audio Compression", C. Faller,<br>
F. Baumgarte, May 2002, Munich, in the IEEE WASPAA Paper<br>
"Efficient representation of spatial audio using perceptual<br>
parametrization", October 2001, Mohonk, NY, in "Binaural<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
cue coding applied to audio compression with flexible<br>
rendering", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, AES 113th<br>
Convention, Los Angeles, Preprint 5686, October 2002 and in<br>
"Binaural cue coding - Part II: Schemes and applications",<br>
C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans, on Speech and Audio<br>
Proc, volume level. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003.<br>
In BCC encoding, a number of audio input channels are<br>
converted to a spectral representation using a DFT<br>
(Discrete Fourier Transform) based transform with<br>
overlapping windows. The resulting uniform spectrum is<br>
divided into non-overlapping partitions. Each partition<br>
approximately has a bandwidth proportional to the<br>
equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB). The BCC parameters<br>
are then estimated between two channels for each partition.<br>
These BCC parameters are normally given for each channel<br>
with respect to a reference channel and are furthermore<br>
quantized. The transmitted parameters are finally<br>
calculated in accordance with prescribed formulas<br>
(encoded), which may also depend on the specific partitions<br>
of the signal to be processed.<br>
A number of BCC parameters do exist. The ICLD parameter,<br>
for example, describes the difference (ratio) of the<br>
energies contained in 2 compared channels. The ICC<br>
parameter (inter-channel coherence/correlation) describes<br>
the correlation between the two channels, which can be<br>
understood as the similarity of the waveforms of the two<br>
channels. The ICTD parameter (inter-channel time<br>
difference) describes a global time shift between the 2<br>
channels whereas the IPD parameter (inter-channel phase<br>
difference) describes the same with respect to the phases<br>
of the signals.<br>
One should be aware that, in a frame-wise processing of an<br>
audio signal, the BCC analysis is also performed frame-<br>
wise, i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This<br>
means that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
individually obtained. This further means that, in case a<br>
audio filter bank decomposes the input signal into for<br>
example 32 band pass signals, a BCC analysis block obtains<br>
a set of BCC parameters for each of the 32 bands.<br>
A related technique, also known as parametric stereo, is<br>
described in J. Breebaart, S. van de Par, A. Kohlrausch, E.<br>
Schuijers, "High-Quality Parametric Spatial Audio Coding at<br>
Low Bitrates", AES 116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6072,<br>
May 2004, and E. Schuijers, J. Breebaart, H. Purnhagen, J.<br>
Engdegard, "Low Complexity Parametric Stereo Coding", AES<br>
116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6073, May 2004.<br>
Summarizing, recent approaches for parametric coding of<br>
multi-channel audio signals ("Spatial Audio Coding",<br>
"Binaural Cue Coding" (BCC) etc.) represent a multi-channel<br>
audio signal by means of a downmix signal (could be<br>
monophonic or comprise several channels) and parametric<br>
side information ("spatial cues") characterizing its<br>
perceived spatial sound stage. It is desirable to keep the<br>
rate of side information as low as possible in order to<br>
minimize overhead information and leave as much of the<br>
available transmission capacity for the coding of the<br>
downmix signals.<br>
One way to keep the bit rate of the side information low is<br>
to losslessly encode the side information of a spatial<br>
audio scheme by applying, for example, entropy coding<br>
algorithms to the side information.<br>
Lossless coding has been extensively applied in general<br>
audio coding in order to ensure an optimally compact<br>
representation for quantized spectral coefficients and<br>
other side information. Examples for appropriate encoding<br>
schemes and methods are given within the ISO/IEC standards<br>
MPEG1 part 3, MPEG2 part 7 and MPEG4 part 3.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
These standards and, for example also the IEEE paper<br>
"Noiseless Coding of Quantized Spectral Coefficients in<br>
MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding", S. R. Quackenbush, J. D.<br>
Johnston, IEEE WASPAA, Mohonk, NY, October 1997 describe<br>
state of the art techniques that include the following<br>
measures to losslessly encode quantized parameters:<br>
•	Multi-dimensional Huffman Coding of quantized spectral<br>
coefficients<br>
•	Using a common (multi-dimensional) Huffman Codebook for<br>
sets of coefficients<br>
•	Coding the value either as a hole or coding sign<br>
information and magnitude information separately (i.e.<br>
have only Huffman codebook entries for a given absolute<br>
value which reduces the necessary codebook size,<br>
"signed" vs. "unsigned" codebooks)<br>
•	Using alternative codebooks of different largest<br>
absolute values (LAVs), i.e. different maximum absolute<br>
values within the parameters to be encoded<br>
•	Using alternative codebooks of different statistical<br>
distribution for each LAV<br>
•	Transmitting the choice of Huffman codebook as side<br>
information to the decoder<br>
•	Using "sections" to define the range of application of<br>
each selected Huffman codebook<br>
•	Differential encoding of scalefactors over frequency<br>
and subsequent Huffman coding of the result<br>
Another technique for the lossless encoding of coarsely<br>
quantized values into a single PCM code is proposed within<br>
the MPEG1 audio standard (called grouping within the<br><br>
6<br>
standard and used for layer 2) . This is explained in more<br>
detail within the standard ISO/IEC 11172-3:93.<br>
The publication "Binaural cue coding - Part II: Schemes and<br>
applications", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans, on<br>
Speech and Audio Proc, volume level. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003<br>
gives some information on coding of BCC parameters. It is<br>
proposed, that quantized ICLD parameters are differentially<br>
encoded<br>
•	over frequency and the result is subsequently Huffman<br>
encoded (with a one-dimensional Huffman code)<br>
•	over time and the result is subsequently Huffman<br>
encoded (with a one-dimensional Huffman code),<br>
and that finally, the more efficient variant is selected as<br>
the representation of an original audio signal.<br>
Bosi M. et al.: "ISO/IEC MPEG-2 Advanced audio coding"<br>
Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, vol. 45, no. 10,<br>
pages 789-812 propose grouping and interleaving of<br>
parameters, prior to their Huffman encoding.<br>
The US application US 5,528,628 relates to variable-length<br>
coding of input symbols using a plurality of variable<br>
length-code tables. The same sequence of symbols is encoded<br>
using different variable length coders or Huffman coders<br>
having different code tables. The decision, which encoded<br>
representation is to be transmitted is finally made,<br>
depending on the resulting code length.<br>
The European patent application 1 047 198 A3 proposes a<br>
similar approach, additionally using only absolute-valued<br>
codebooks.<br>
Shen-Chuan Tai et al.: "An adaptive 3-D discrete cosine<br>

dimensional image data using a coding algorithm, originally<br>
developed to encode three-dimensional information. In the<br>
proposed method, a segmentation technique based on the<br>
local energy magnitude is used to segment subblocks of the<br>
image into different energy levels. Those subblocks with<br>
the same energy level are then gathered to form a three-<br>
dimensional cuboid. Then, a three-DCT is employed to<br>
compress the three-dimensional cuboid individually.<br>
Faller C et al.: "Binaural Cue Coding - Part II: Schemes<br>
and Applications", IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio<br>
Processing, Vol. 11, no. 6, 6 October 2003, pages 520-531,<br>
propose a differential coding in the time and the frequency<br>
direction prior to Huffman coding. Finally, the<br>
differential representation resulting in the lower bit rate<br>
is chosen.<br>
As mentioned above, it has been proposed to optimize<br>
compression performance by applying differential coding<br>
over frequency and, alternatively, over time and select the<br>
more efficient variant. The selected variant is then<br>
signaled to a decoder via some side information.<br>
There has been quite some effort made to reduce the size of<br>
a downmix audio channel and the corresponding side<br>
information. Nonetheless the achievable bit rates are still<br>
too high to allow for every possible application. For<br>
example, streaming of audio and video content to mobile<br>
phones requires the least possible bit rates and therefore<br>
a more efficient encoding of the content.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved coding concept achieving a lossless compression of<br>
parameter values with higher efficiency.<br><br>

In accordance with the third aspect of the present<br>

including a second set of parameters including a<br>
representation of a second portion of the original signal,<br>
the second portion neighboring the first portion, and for<br>

In accordance with the sixth aspect of the present<br>
invention, this object is achieved by a computer program<br>
implementing the above method, when running on a computer.<br>
In accordance with the seventh aspect of the present<br>
invention, this object is achieved by a compressed<br>
representation of parameters, the parameters including a<br><br>
-11-<br>
first set of parameters including a representation of a<br>
first portion of an original signal, the parameters further<br>
including a second set of parameters including a<br>
representation of a second portion of the original signal,<br>
the second portion neighboring the first portion of the<br>
original signal, comprising: an encoded block of parameters<br>
representing a used sequence of tuples; and a sequence<br>
indication indicating the used sequence of tuples of a<br>
first or a second sequence underlying the encoded block of<br>
parameters, where the first sequence includes a first tuple<br>
having two parameters from the first set of parameters and<br>
where the second sequence includes a second tuple having<br>
one parameter from the first set of parameters and one<br>
parameter from the second set of parameters.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that<br>
parameters including a first set of parameters of a<br>
representation of a first portion of an original signal and<br>
including a second set of parameters of a representation of<br>
a second portion of the original signal can be efficiently<br>
encoded, when the parameters are arranged in a first<br>
sequence of tuples and in a second sequence of tuples,<br>
wherein the first sequence of tuples comprises tuples of<br>
parameters having two parameters from a single portion of<br>
the original signal and wherein the second sequence of<br>
tuples comprises tuples of parameters having one parameter<br>
from the first portion and one parameter from the second<br>
portion of the original signal. An efficient encoding can<br>
be achieved using a bit estimator to estimate the number of<br>
necessary bits to encode the first and the second sequence<br>
of tuples, wherein only the sequence of tuples is encoded,<br>
that results in the lower number of bits.<br>
The basic principle therefore is, that one rearranges the<br>
parameters to be encoded, for example in time and in<br>
frequency, and finally uses the one arrangement( sequence<br>
of tuples) of the parameters for the compression, that<br><br>
-12-<br>
results in the lower number of bits for the compressed<br>
parameters.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, two sets of<br>
spectral parameters, describing the spectral representation<br>
of two consecutive time portions of an original signal are<br>
adaptively grouped in pairs of two parameters to enhance<br>
the coding efficiency. Therefore, on the one hand a<br>
sequence of tuples is generated using tuples of parameters<br>
consisting of two neighboring frequency parameters from the<br>
same time portion. On the other hand, a second sequence of<br>
tuples is generated using tuples, that are built using a<br>
first parameter from the first time portion and the<br>
corresponding parameter from the second time portion of the<br>
original signal. Then, both sequences of tuples are encoded<br>
using a two-dimensional Huffman code. The two encoded<br>
sequences of tuples are compared in their sizes and the<br>
tuple resulting in the lower number of bits is finally<br>
selected to be transmitted. The information, which kind of<br>
tuples has been used to build the encoded data is<br>
transmitted to a decoder as additional side information.<br>
One advantage of the previously described inventive encoder<br>
is, that due to the grouping of parameters into tuples<br>
consisting of two parameters, a two-dimensional Huffman<br>
code can be applied for the compression, which generally<br>
results in a lower bit rate.<br>
A second advantage is, that the adaptive grouping, i.e. the<br>
concept to dynamically decide between two possible grouping<br>
strategies during the encoding process, yields a further<br>
decrease in the bit rate of the side information.<br>
Deciding between the two grouping strategies only once for<br>
a set of two consecutive frames additionally reduces the<br>
amount of required side information, since the indication,<br>
which grouping strategy has been used during the encoding,<br><br>
-13-<br>
has to be transmitted only once for a set of two complete<br>
consecutive time frames.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention an<br>
inventive compression unit additionally comprises a<br>
differential encoder, that differentially encodes the<br>
parameters either in time or in frequency prior to the<br>
adaptive grouping. That differential encoding together with<br>
the adaptive grouping and an appropriate Huffman codebook<br>
further reduces the size of the side information to be<br>
transmitted. The two differential encoding possibilities<br>
together with the two grouping strategies result in a total<br>
number of four possible combinations, further increasing<br>
the probability of finding an encoding rule, that results<br>
in a low side information bit rate.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inventive concept is used for a decompression unit,<br>
allowing to decode encoded blocks of parameters and to<br>
rebuild the original frames based on a side information<br>
signaling the grouping scheme underlying the encoded blocks<br>
of parameters. In an advantageous modification the<br>
inventive decoder also allows the decoding of data that has<br>
not been adaptively grouped, therefore a compatibility of<br>
the inventive decoder with existing equipment can be<br>
achieved.<br>

result from applying an encoding rule to the two tuples<br>
106a and 106b. The bit estimator 102 chooses the tuple<br>
resulting in the lower number of bits and signals via a<br>
signaling output 112a, whether the tuple 106a or 106b will<br>
result in the lower number of bits.<br>
Based on the decision of the bit estimator 102, the tuple<br>
resulting in the lower number of bits is finally encoded<br>
into encoded blocks 118, that are provided via output 120a<br>
of the provider 104, wherein the provider further signals a<br>
sequence indication at his signaling line 120b, indicating<br>
what original sequence of tuples (106a or 106b) was encoded<br>
to derive the encoded blocks 118.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the same functionality can be<br>
achieved, when the dashed connections 122a and 122b between<br>
the supplier 100 and the provider 104 are omitted. In this<br><br>
-15-<br>
alternative scenario the bit estimator 102 would encode the<br>
sequence of tuples 106a and 106b, and would transfer two<br>
different encoded blocks 124a and 124b to the provider 104,<br>
where the provider additionally signals from which of the<br>
original sequences of tuples 106a and 106b the encoded<br>
blocks 124a and 124b are derived. To this end, the<br>
signaling output 112a of the bit estimator 102 can be used<br>
or the signaling can be derived by the provider 104<br>
implicitly.<br>
In this alternative embodiment the provider 104 would<br>
simply forward the encoded block with the lower number of<br>
bits to its output 120a, additionally providing the<br>
sequence indication.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of two adaptive grouping schemes<br>
that are used to derive a sequence of tuples to be encoded.<br>
To explain the principle of the inventive adaptive<br>
grouping, four subsequent time frames 130a to 130d of an<br>
original signal are shown, wherein each of the frames is<br>
having a set of five spectral parameters 132a to 132e.<br>
According to the present invention, the spectral parameters<br>
of two consecutive frames are grouped either in frequency,<br>
as illustrated by the tuples 134a and 134b or in time, as<br>
illustrated by the tuples 136a and 136b to build the<br>
sequences of tuples. The grouping in time results in a<br>
first sequence of tuples 138, whereas the grouping in<br>
frequency results in the second sequence of tuples 140.<br>
The sequences of tuples 138 and 140 are encoded using for<br>
example a Huffman codebook, resulting into two different<br>
sequences of code words 142 and 144. According to the<br>
present invention, the sequence of code words requiring the<br>
fewer number of bits, is finally transmitted to a decoder,<br>
that has to additionally receive a sequence indication,<br>
signaling whether time grouping or frequency grouping is<br>
underlying the sequence of code words. As can be seen in<br><br>
-16-<br>
Fig. 2, for the shown example of adaptive grouping of pairs<br>
of parameters (2-dimensional) , the sequence indication can<br>
consist of only one single bit.<br>
Fig. 3 shows some alternative grouping strategies, that can<br>
be used to implement the inventive adaptive grouping,<br>
allowing for Huffman codes with dimensions bigger than 2.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a grouping strategy for a two-dimensional<br>
Huffman code 146a, for a three-dimensional Huffman code<br>
146b and a for a four-dimensional Huffman code 146c. For<br>
each of the strategies two consecutive time frames are<br>
illustrated, wherein the parameters belonging to the same<br>
tuple are represented by the same capital letters.<br>
In the case of the two-dimensional Huffman code the<br>
grouping is done as already illustrated in Fig. 2, building<br>
two-dimensional tuples in frequency 148a and in time 148b.<br>
In case of building tuples consisting of three parameters,<br>
the frequency tuples 158a are such, that three neighboring<br>
frequency parameters within one frame are grouped together<br>
to form a tuple. The time tuples 150b can be built such,<br>
that two neighboring parameters from one frame are combined<br>
with one parameter from the other frame, as is shown in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
Four-dimensional frequency grouped tuples 152a are built<br>
corresponding to the other frequency tuples by grouping<br>
four neighboring parameters of one frame into one tuple.<br>
The time grouping tuples 152b are built such, that two<br>
neighboring parameters of one frame are combined with two<br>
neighboring parameters of the other frame, wherein the<br>
parameter pairs of the single frames are describing the<br>
same spectral property of the two consecutive time frames.<br>
Allowing different grouping schemes, as illustrated in Fig.<br>
3, one can significantly reduce the bit rate of the side<br>
information, for example if one uses a variety of<br><br>
17<br>
predefined Huffman codebooks of different dimensions, the<br>
dimension of the grouping can be varied within the encoding<br>
process such, that the representation resulting in the<br>
lowest bit rate can be used at any time within the encoding<br>
process.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, how an inventive compression unit, that<br>
additionally comprises a differential encoder, can be used<br>
to further decrease the side information, by applying some<br>
differential encoding before the Huffman encoding process.<br>
To illustrate the differential encoding in time and<br>
frequency or in time and frequency, the same absolute<br>
representation of parameters 160, that was already shown in<br>
Fig. 2, is used as a basis for the various differential<br>
encoding steps. The first possibility is to differentially<br>
encode the parameters of the absolute representation 160 in<br>
frequency, resulting in the differentially encoded<br>
parameters 162. As can be seen in Fig. 4, to differentially<br>
encode the absolute representation 160, the first parameter<br>
of each frame is left unchanged, whereas the second<br>
parameter is replaced by the difference of the second<br>
parameter and the first parameter of the absolute<br>
representation 160. The other parameters within the<br>
differentially encoded representation are built following<br>
the same rule.<br>
Another possibility is the differential coding in time,<br>
yielding the representation 164. This representation is<br>
built by leaving the complete first frame unchanged,<br>
whereas the parameters of the following frames are replaced<br>
by the difference of the parameter of the absolute<br>
representation and the same parameter of the previous<br>
frame, as can be seen in Fig. 4.<br>
A third possibility is to first encode differentially in<br>
frequency, followed by a differential encoding in time or<br>
vice versa, both resulting in the same encoded<br><br>
- 18-<br>
representation 166, that is differentially encoded in time<br>
and frequency.<br>
It is to be noted, that one has the chance to use those<br>
four different representations of the original signal as<br>
input to the adaptive grouping. Having a look at the<br>
different representations 160 to 166 of the given example<br>
of parameters, one can clearly see how the differential<br>
encoding has impact on the transmitted rate of side<br>
information. Looking at the absolute representation 160,<br>
one recognizes, that neither a grouping in time nor in<br>
frequency would result in tuples having the same content.<br>
Therefore no appropriate Huffman codebook is constructable,<br>
that would assign the shortest code words to the tuples<br>
occurring most.<br>
The case is different looking at the differentially in<br>
frequency encoded representation 162, where one could<br>
construct a Huffman codebook that only needs to have four<br>
entries to cover the full representation, and where either<br>
the tuple (1, 1) or the tuple (2, 2) would be assigned the<br>
code word with minimum length, to achieve a compact side<br>
information.<br>
The advantage is less obvious in the representation being<br>
differentially encoded in time 164. Nonetheless one can<br>
gain also here, grouping in frequency and making use of the<br>
numerous tuples (5, 5) and (10, 10).<br>
For the representation that is differentially encoded in<br>
time and in frequency 166, one would even achieve a further<br>
reduction of the side information bit rate than in the<br>
representation 162, since a grouping in time would result<br>
in a high multiplicity of the tuple (1, 0), as indicated in<br>
the figure, allowing to construct a Huffman codebook, that<br>
would assign the shortest code word to the previous tuple.<br><br>
-19-<br>
As can be clearly seen in Fig. 4, the high flexibility of<br>
the inventive concept making use of adaptive grouping and<br>
of differential encoding allows to choose the strategy that<br>
fits the original audio signal most, thus allowing to keep<br>
the side information bit rate low.<br>
To summarize, in one preferred embodiment the quantized<br>
parameter values are first differentially encoded over time<br>
(variant 1) and differentially over frequency (variant 2) .<br>
The resulting parameters can then be grouped adaptively<br>
over time (variant a) and frequency (variant b) . As a<br>
result, four combinations are available (la, lb, 2a, 2b)<br>
from which the best is selected and signaled to the<br>
decoder. This could be done by a 2 bit information only,<br>
representing the variants la, lb, 2a, 2b by, for example,<br>
the bit combination 00, 01, 10, 11.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a decoder according to the current invention,<br>
to decode encoded blocks of parameters, wherein the block<br>
of parameters includes a first frame having a set of first<br>
spectral parameters and a second frame having a set of<br>
second spectral parameters.<br>
The decoder 200 comprises a decompressor 202 and a frame<br>
builder 204. The decompressor receives on an input an<br>
encoded block of parameters 206. The decompressor derives,<br>
using a decoding rule, a sequence of tuples of parameters<br>
208 from the encoded block of parameters 206. This sequence<br>
of tuples of parameters 208 is input into the frame builder<br>
204.<br>
The frame builder additionally receives a sequence<br>
indication 210, indicating what sequence of tuples have<br>
been used by the encoder to build the encoded block of<br>
parameters.<br>
The frame builder 204 then reorders the sequence of tuples<br>
208 steered by the sequence indication 210 to reconstruct<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
the first frame 112a and the second frame 112b from the<br>
sequence of tuples of parameters 208.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention described<br>
above achieve a further enhancement of the coding<br>
efficiency by introducing adaptive grouping of values to be<br>
coded using a multi-dimensional Huffman code. As an<br>
example, both, two-dimensional grouping of values over<br>
frequency can be done as well as two-dimensional grouping<br>
of values over time. The encoding scheme would then do both<br>
types of encoding and choose the more advantageous one<br>
(i.e. the variant which requires less bits). This decision<br>
is signaled to the decoder via side information.<br>
In further examples, as illustrated in Fig. 3, it is also<br>
possible to build higher-dimensional Huffman codes,<br>
applying different grouping strategies to build the tuples.<br>
The given examples show grouping strategies that build the<br>
tuples by grouping together parameters from two consecutive<br>
frames only. It is also possible to do the grouping using<br>
parameters from three or more consecutive frames, doing the<br>
grouping in a straight forward way.<br>
In a modification of the inventive encoder, it is also<br>
possible to combine the differential grouping and the<br>
differential encoding strategies with the use of different<br>
Huffman codebooks to derive the shortest possible<br>
representation of the side information. This could further<br>
reduce the side information bit rate of an encoded audio<br>
signal at the cost of having additional side information<br>
parameters, signaling the Huffman codebook used for the<br>
encoding.<br>
The described preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention show the inventive concept for examples, where<br>
the grouping strategy does not change within two<br>
consecutive time frames. In a modification of the present<br>
invention it is of course also possible, to have multiple<br><br><br>
-21-<br>
changes between the grouping in time and in frequency<br>
within a set of two frames, which would imply that the<br>
sequence indication is also supplied within the frames, to<br>
signal the change of grouping strategy.<br>
In the given examples, the parameters are differentially<br>
encoded before being Huffman encoded. Of course every other<br>
lossless encoding rule is also possible prior to the<br>
Huffman encoding of the parameters, the aim of the encoding<br>
being to derive as much tuples with the same content as<br>
possible.<br>
There are four different possible parameter representations<br>
given in Fig. 4, namely the absolute representation, the<br>
differential representation in frequency, the differential<br>
representation in time and the differential representation<br>
in time and frequency. To choose between four<br>
representations, the side information signaling which<br>
representation has been used, has to be at least two bits<br>
in size, as indicated in Fig. 4. To balance the win of a<br>
possible efficiency gain of the coding versus the<br>
additional spectral representation indication, one could of<br>
course also decide to principally allow only two possible<br>
representations, reducing the spectral representation<br>
indication to the length of a single bit.<br>
As an example of an inventive decoder, Fig. 5 shows a<br>
decoder 200 that receives in addition to the encoded block<br>
of parameters 206 some side information. The side<br>
information steering the frame builder 204 only comprises a<br>
sequence indication 210 in the given example. A decoder<br>
according to the present invention can of course process<br>
any other side information required, especially a spectral<br>
representation indication, indicating the spectral<br>
representation that has been used to encode original<br>
frames.<br><br>

of a first portion of an original signal, the<br>
parameters further including a second set of<br>
parameters including a representation of a second<br>
portion of the original signal, the second portion<br>
neighboring the first portion, and for processing a<br>
sequence indication, the method comprising:<br>
decompressing, using a decoding rule depending on an<br>
encoding rule used for encoding sequences of tuples,<br>
the encoded block of parameters to derive a sequence<br>
of tuples of parameters, each tuple having the same<br>
length and at least two parameters;<br>
receiving the sequence indication, the sequence<br>
indication indicating a used sequence of tuples from a<br>
number of different sequences underlying the encoded<br>
block; and<br>

of the used sequence of tuples.<br>
33.	Compressed representation of parameters, the<br>
parameters including a first set of parameters<br>
including a representation of a first portion of an<br>
original signal, the parameters further including a<br>
second set of parameters including a representation of<br>
a second portion of the original signal, the second<br>
portion neighboring the first portion of the original<br>
signal, comprising:<br><br>
-34-<br>
an encoded block of parameters representing a used<br>
sequence of tuples of equal length; and<br>
a sequence indication indicating the used sequence of<br>
tuples of a first or a second sequence underlying the<br>
encoded block of parameters, where the first sequence<br>
includes a first tuple having two parameters from the<br>
first set of parameters and where the second sequence<br>
includes a second tuple having one parameter from the<br>
first set of parameters and one parameter from the<br>
second set of parameters, wherein the first tuple only<br>
has parameters from the first set of parameters.<br>
34. Compressed representation of parameters in accordance<br>
with claim 33, which is stored on a computer readable<br>
media.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that parameters including a first set of parameters of a representation of a first portion of an original signal and including a second set of parameters of a representation of<br>
a second portion of the original signal can be efficiently encoded, when the parameters are arranged in a first sequence of tuples and in a second sequence of tuples, wherein the first sequence of tuples comprises tuples of<br>
parameters having two parameters from a single portion of the original signal and wherein the second sequence of tuples comprises tuples of parameters having one parameter from the first portion and one parameter from the second<br>
portion of the original signal. An efficient encoding can be achieved using a bit estimator to estimate the number of necessary bits to encode the first and the second sequence<br>
of tuples, wherein only the sequence of tuples is encoded, that results in the lower number of bits.<br></td>
