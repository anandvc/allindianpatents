METHODS AND APPARATUS RELATED TO POWER CONTROL AND/OR<br>
INTERFERENCE MANAGEMENT IN A MIXED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM SUPPORTING WAN SIGNALING AND PEER<br>
TO PEER SIGNALING<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent AppJication S.N, 60/845.053 filed on September 35, 2006, titled "BEACONS IN A MIXED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM" and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application S.N. 11/764,332 filed June 18, 2007 titled "METHODS AND APPARATUS RELATED TO PEER TO PEER DEVICE CONTROL" both of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference and both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present application.<br>
FIELD<br>
(0002] Various embodiments are directed to methods and apparatus for wireless communications, and more particularly to methods and apparatus related to peer to peer communications.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]     Wireless spectrum is an expensive and valuable resource. In wide area network systems, e.g., cellular systems, wireless spectrum allocated to the WAN is, at times, less than fully utilized. It would be advantageous if methods and apparatus were developed which recognized and/or utilized such underutilized air link resources. It would be beneficial if such methods and apparatus were adaptive such that interference to the WAN communications generated from the additional usage of the air link resource could be managed. Methods and apparatus that share bandwidth between WAN communications and peer to peer communications while causing minimal disruption and/or modification to a WAN system would be beneficial.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004]     Methods and apparatus related to the sharing of wide area network (WAN) uplink bandwidth with peer to peer communication signaling usage are described. A base station transmits a signal into a base station downlink frequency band, e.g., a beacon signal or non-beacon broadcast chaimel signal serving as a reference and/or control information signal, to be used by a peer to peer wireless terminal in controlling its peer to peer transmit power level in a corresponding base station uplink frequency band. The peer to peer wireless terminal receives and evaluates the base station signal. The evaluation, e.g., a received signal power measurement and/or decoding operation, obtains information used by the peer to peer wireless terminal in determining whether or not peer to peer signal transmission is permitted and/or in determining a peer to peer transmission power level. In some embodiments, current service level information and/or other encoded information, e.g., an interference level indicator value, conveyed by the received base station signal are utilized by the peer to peer wireless terminal in determining a peer to peer transmission power level.<br>
[0005]     In various embodiments, the base station varies the transmission power level of a signal being tr^msmitted and/or varies the information being communicated by the signal. In this way, the base station can dynamically regulate interference being generated by the peer to peer wireless terminals which is impacting its reception of WAN uplink signals.<br>
[0006]     Since the reference and/or control signal transmitted by the base station, which is Intended for the peer to peer wireless terminals, is communicated in the base station's downlink frequency band, the base station can simply incorporate this signal into its downlink transmission structure. If such a signal had instead been designated to be transmitted in the base station's uplink band, the base station would need to restrict WAN uplink signaling from cellular communications devices during such a time interval since it is not practical for (he base station to be transmitting and receiving in the same band concurrently due to interference considerations. Thus this approach of communicating the peer to peer reference/control signal in a base station downlink band is advantageous from the perspective of base station design considerations and/or impact to WAN uplink signaling.<br>
 <br>
[0007]     An exemplary method of operating a wireless communications device supporting peer to peer communications in a base station uplink frequency band comprises: receiving a first signal from a base station in a downlink frequency band; performing an evaluation on the received signal; and confrolling peer to peer transmission power for at least some peer to peer signal transmissions in said uplink fi-equency band as a function of the result of the evaluation of said first received signal. An exempiary wireless communications device supporting peer to peer communications in a base station uph'nk frequency band comprises: a receiver module for receiving a first signal from a base station in a downlink fi-equency band; a signal processing module for performing an evaluation on the received signal; and a peer to peer transmission power control module for controlling peer to peer transmission power for at least some peer to peer signal transmissions in said uplink frequency band as a function of the result of the evaluation of said first received signal.<br>
[0008]     An exemplary method of operating a base station to control interference from peer to peer commiznications in a first communications band compnses: generating a peer to peer fransmission power control signal; and transmitting said peer to peer transmission power control signal in a second communications band, said second communications band being different from said first communications band. An exemplary base station which controls interference from peer to peer communications in a first communications band, the base station comprises; a peer to peer transmission power control signal generation module for generating a peer to peer transmission power control signaj; and a fransmitter module for transmitfing said peer to peer transmission power control signal in a second communications band, said second communications band being different from said first communications band. In some embodiments the base stadon generates and transmits different distinct control signals to control power transmission levels for wide area network uplink transmission power control and for peer to peer transmission power confrol.<br>

[00351     Figure 1 is a flowchart 100 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless communications device supporting peer to peer communications in a base station uplink frequency band. Operation starts in step 102, where the wireless communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 104. In step ] 04, the wireless communications device receives a first signal from a base station in a downlink frequency band. The first signal is, in some embodiments, a beacon signal. In some such embodiments, the beacon signal includes at most three OFDM tones, and the tones of the beacon signal have a per tone transmission power level that is at least 1 OdBs higher than the average per tone transmission power level of a non-null tone of a peer to peer signal. In some embodiments, the first signal is a broadcast channel signal. In some such embodiments, the broadcast channel signal includes a set of OFDM tones, and the tones of the broadcast channel signal have a per tone transmission power level that is at least 3dBs higher than the average per tone transmission power level of a non-nuii tone of a peer to peer signal. In another embodiment, the first signal is a CDMA pilot signal.<br>
[0036]     In some embodiments, the uplink and downlink frequency bands correspond to different non-overlapping frequency division duplex (FDD) wide area network (WAN) base station communications bands.    In some other embodiments, the uplink frequency band corresponds to a base station time division duplex (TDD) band during uplink time slots and the downlink frequency band corresponds to the same base station TDD band during downlink time slots. Figure 24 illustrates an exemplary WAN FDD spectrum deployment including air link resource sharing with peer to peer signaling. Figure 23 illusfrates an exemplary WAN TDD spectrum deployment including air link resource sharing with peer to peer signaling.<br>
[0037]     Operation proceeds from step 104 to step 106. In step 106, the wireless communications device performs an evaluation of the received signal. In some<br>
 <br>
embodiments, the evaluation is a signal power measurement. In some embodiments the evaluation is an extraction of encoded information conveyed in the received signal. In various embodiments, the evaluation includes obtaining information fi"0m both the received power level of the received signal and extracted encoded information conveyed in the received signal.   Operation proceeds from step 106 to step 108.<br>
[0038]     In step ! 08, the wireless communications device controls peer to peer transmission power for at least some peer to peer signal transmissions in said uplink frequency band as aresult of the evaluation of said first received signal. In some embodiments, controlling peer to peer transmission power includes using a first function which limits peer to peer transmission power to a lower level for a first received signal power level than for a second received signal power level, which is higher than the first received signal power level. In various embodiments, the first function determines a maximum permitted peer to peer transmission power level. Operation proceeds from step 108 to step 110.<br>
[0039]     In step 110, the v/ireless communications device receives a second signal from said base station in the downlink frequency band at a time which is different from the time at which said first signal is received. Then, in step 112, the wireless communications device performs an evaluation on the second received signal. Operation proceeds from step 112 to step 114.<br>
[0040]     In step 114, the wireless communications device determines whether it should refrain from transmitting peer to peer signals. If in step 114, the wireless communications device determines that it should refrain from transmitting peer to peer signals then, operation proceeds from step 114 to step 120. If in step 114 the wireless communications device determines that it is permitted to transmit peer to peer signals, operation proceeds from step 114 to step 116.<br>
[0041]     In step 116 the wireless communications device determines a peer to peer transmission power level as a function of information derived from the evaluation of the second received signal. Operation proceeds from step 116 to step 118 in which the wireless communications device transmits peer to peer signals in accordance with the determined peer to peer transmission power level.<br>
[0042]     Retuming to step 120, in step 120 the wireless communications device refrains from transmitting peer to peer communications in the uplink frequency band until determining from evaluating another signal from the base station that the wireless<br>
 <br>
communications device is permitted to transmit peer to peer signals. Operation proceeds from step 118 or step !20 to step 110 where the wireless communications device receives another signal from the base station.<br>
[0043]     Figure 2 is a flowchart 200 of an exemplary method of operating a base station to control interference from peer to peer communications in a first communications band. The first communications band is utilized for both: (i) wide area network uplink signaling directed from a wide area network wireless terminal to the base station and (ii) peer to peer communications signaling between two peer to peer wireless terminals. Operation starts in step 202 where the exemplary base station is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 204. In step 204, the base station measures interference to wide area network uplink signaling. Operation proceeds from step 204 to step 206. In step 206, the base station estimates the interference contribution sourced irom peer to peer devices. Then, in step 208, the base station generates a first peer to peer transmission power control signal and in step 210 the base station generates a wide area network uplink transmission power control signal. Operation proceeds from step 210 to step 212.<br>
[0044]     In step 212 the base station transmits the generated first peer to peer transmission power control signal in a second communications band, said second communicadons band being different from said first communications band, and in step 214, the base station transmits the generated wide area network uplink transmission power control signal in said second communications band to a wide area network wireless terminal or terminals. The second communications band is utilized for conveying both: (i) a downlink signal firom the base station directed to a wide area network wireless lemiinal and (ii) a peer to peer transmission power control signal to a peer to peer wireless terminal.<br>
[0045]     In some embodiments, the first communications band is a frequency division duplex (FDD) wide area network (WAN) uplink frequency band and the second communications band is a frequency division duplex (FDD) wide area network (WAN) downlink frequency band. In some such embodiments, the uplink frequency band and downlink frequency band are non-overlapping and form a corresponding pair. In some other embodiments, the first communications band is a base station time division duplex (TDD) band during uplink time slots and the second communications band is the same base station time division duplex (TDD) band during downlink time<br>
 <br>
slots. Figure 24 illustrates an exemplary WAN FDD spectrum deployment including air link resource sharing with peer to peer signaling. Figure 23 illustrates an exemplary WAN TDD spectrum deployment including air link resource sharing with peer to peer signaling.<br>
[0046]     In some embodiments, the peer to peer transmission power control signal is a beacon signal. In some such embodiments, the beacon signal includes at most three OFDM tones and the tones of the beacon signal have a per tone transmission power level that is at least lOdBs higher than the average per tone transmission power level of a non-null tone of a peer to peer signal.<br>
[0047]     In some embodiments, the peer to peer transmission power control signal is a broadcast channel signal. In some such embodiments, the broadcast channel signal includes a set of OFDM tones and the tones of the broadcast channel signal have a per tone transmission power level at least 3dBs higher than the average per tone transmission power level of anon-null tone of a peer to peer signal.<br>
[0048]     In some other embodiments, the peer to peer transmission power control signal is a CDMA pilot signal.<br>
[0049]     Operation proceeds from step 214 to step 2 ] 6. In step 2 ] 6, the base station measures interference to WAN uplink signaling and in step 218 the base station estimates the interference contribution sourced from peer to peer devices. Operation proceeds from step 218 to step 220. In step 220 the base station determines whether to command peer to peer wireless terminal or terminals to alter fransmission power levels. Operation proceeds from step 220 to step 222. In step 222, if the base station decides to command a peer to peer transmission power alteration, operation proceeds from step 222 to step 224; otherwise, operation proceeds from step 222 to step 226.<br>
[OOSO]     Returning to step 224, in step 224, ihe base station generates a second peer to peer transmission power control signal. In some embodiments, step 224 includes sub-step 228 in which the base station encodes different control information in said second peer to peer transmission power control signal than in the previous peer to peer transmission power control signal. In some such embodiments, the encoded information is to be used by a peer to peer wireless terminal in regulating its peer to peer transmission power level, e.g., in determining a maximum permitted peer to peer transmission power level. Operation proceeds from step 224 to step 230. In step 230, the base station transmits the generated second peer to peer transmission power control<br>
 <br>
signal. In some embodiments, step 230 includes sub-step 232 in which the base station transmits said second peer to peer transmission power control signal at a different transmission power level than the power level at which the previous peer to peer transmission power control signal was transmitted at. In some such embodiments, the received power level of a peer to peer transmission power control signal is to be used by a peer to peer wireless terminal in regulating its peer to peer transmission power level, e.g., in determining a maximum permitted peer to peer transmission power level.<br>
[OOSl]     Returning to step 226, in step 226, the base station retransmits the previously transmitted peer to peer transmission power control signal. Operation proceeds from step 230 or step 226 to step 216, where interference to WAN uplink signaling is measured.<br>
[0052]     Figure 3 is a drawing of an exemplary wireless communications device 2300, e.g., a wireless terminal such as a mobile node, supporting peer to peer communications in a base station's WAN uplink band in accordance with various embodiments.

Receiver module 2302 also receives peer to peer communications signals in an uplink frequency<br>
 <br>
band of the base station. In some embodiments, during some times, receiver module 2302 receives downlink signals, e.g., assignment signals and traffic signals, from a base station that the wireless communications device is using as a point of attachment in a wide area network, with the communications device 2300 functioning as a cellular communications device,<br>
[0056|     Transmitter module 2304, e.g., an OFDM transmitter, is coupled to transmit antenna 2316, via which the wireless communications device 2300 transmits peer to peer signals to other wireless communications devices using a base station uplink frequency band. In some embodiments, during some time intervals, the transmitter module 2304 transmits uplink signals to a base station, with the wireless communications device functioning in a WAN mode of operation, e.g., a cellular mode of operation,<br>
(0057)     User I/O devices 2308 include, e.g., microphone, keyboard, keypad, mouse, camera, switches, speaker, display, etc. User I/O devices 2308 allow a user of wireless communications device 2300 to input data/information, access output data;'infonnation, and control at least some functions of the wireless communications device 2300, e.g., attempt to initiate a peer to peer communications session.<br>

[0090J     Figure 5 is a flowchart 700 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless communications device which supports peer to peer signaling in an uplink frequency band in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 702, where the wireless communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 704, where the wireless communications device receives a first signal, e.g., a reference and/or control signal, from a base station in a downlink frequency band used by said base station. This approach of using the downlink band of tlie base station to convey a reference and/or control signal is simple from the base station's perspective as the base station can easily include the first signal intended for peer to peer wireless terminals as part or its set of broadcast signals. The first signal is, in some embodiments, a beacon signal. In other embodiments, the first signal is a non-beacon broadcast channel signal. The peer to peer wireless communications device monitors the base station downlink band for the first signal and uses the base station's uplink band to exchange peer to peer signals with other peer nodes. In some embodiments, the peer to peer wireless communications device includes receiver capabilities to be tuned concurrently to multiple bands, so as to receive signals from both (i) the base stadon's downlink band for receiving the reference and/or control signal from the base station and (ii) the base station's uplink band for receiving peer to peer signals from other peer to peer wireless communications devices. In some embodiments, the peer to peer wireless communications device supports reception from only a single band at a given time, and the peer to peer device's receiver is switched between the base station's downlink band and the base station's uplink band as a function of whether a downlink broadcast reference and/or control signal is to be received from the base station or<br>
 <br>
whether a peer to peer communications signa! is to be received from a peer communications device.<br>
[0091]     Operation proceeds from step 704 to step 706. In step 706, the wireless communications device performs a measurement on the received signal, e.g., a signal power measurement. Operation proceeds to one or more of steps 708 and 722. In some embodiments, the wireless communications device supports peer to peer signaling, but does not support uplink signaling to the base station, e.g., as part of a cellular network, and in such embodiments, step 722 is not an option. In some embodiments, the wireless communications device supports, at any given time one of a peer to peer mode and a cellular mode of operation, and for a given lime, operation can proceed to one of step 70S and step 722. In some embodiments, the wireless communications device supports concurrent peer to peer signaling and cellular signaling and operation may proceed from step 706 to steps 708 and step 722.<br>
[0092]     Operation proceeds from step 706 to step 708 for peer to peer signaling, while operation proceeds from step 706 to step 722 for uplink signals to the base station. In step 708, the wireless communications device controls peer to peer transmission power for at least some peer to peer signal transmissions as a ftinction of the result of the measurement of the first signal. Step 708 includes sub-steps 710 and 712. In sub-step 710, the wireless communications device uses a first funcfion, which limits peer to peer transmission power to a lower level for a first received signal power level than for a second received signal power level which is higher than said first received signal power level, to determine a maximum transmission permitted peer to peer transmission power level. Then, in sub-step 712, the wireless communications device detennines an actual peer to peer transmission power level as a funcfion of the determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level and a peer to peer signal received fi-om a second peer to peer communications device. The second peer to peer cormnunications device is, e.g., the peer device with which the communicafions device performing the operadons of flowchart 700 is having a peer to peer communications session. Thus, the peer to peer transmission power level, in some embodiments, is influenced by both a received base station signal and a peer to peer signal. The peer to peer signal, in some embodiments, communicates and/or is used to derive at least one of: peer to peer channel condifion informafion, peer to peer data rate information, peer to peer data backlog information, peer to peer latency informafion, noise information, error rate<br>
 <br>
information, service level information and peer to peer power control information. In some embodiments, the actual peer to peer transmission power is restricted to be equal to or below the determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level. In some embodiments, for at least some conditions, e.g., a high priority user or a certain service level, the actual peer to peer transmission levei can sometimes exceed, e.g., override, the determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level which is based on the received base station signal, Operation proceeds from step 708 to step 714.<br>
|0093]     In step 714, the wireless communications device receives a second signal from the base station in the downlink frequency band at a time which is different from the time at which said first signal is received.   Then, in step 716, the wireless communications device performs a measurement of the received second signal, e.g., a power measurement of the received second signal. Operation proceeds from step 716 to step 718, in which the wireless communications device determines from the measured power of the second received signal that the wireless communications device should refrain from transmitting peer to peer communications signals into the uplink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 718 to step 720. In step 720, the wireless communications device refrains from transmitting peer to peer communications signals into the uplink frequency band after determining that the communications device should refrain from transmitting peer to peer communications signals until detennining from measuring the power of another signal from the base station that the wireless communications device is permitted to transmit peer to peer signals into the uplink frequency band.<br>
[0094|     Returning to step 722, in step 722, the wireless communications device controls transmission power of a signal transmitted to a transmission power level which is greater than said peer to peer transmission power level used for at least some peer to peer signal transmissions. Step 722 includes sub-step 724. In sub-step 724, the wireless communications device uses a second function when controlling transmission power to said base station to determined the transmission power of said signal transmitted to said base station based on the measured power of the received first signal, said second function being different from said first fiinction. In some embodiments, the peer to peer transmission signal power level is at least 1 OdBs below the transmission power level of the said signal transmitted to the base station.<br>

Actual peer to peer transmission power level sub-module 2932 determines an actual peer to peer signal transmission power level as a function of said maximum peer to peer transmission power level and a peer to peer signal received irom a second peer to peer communications device. In various embodiments, sub-module 2932 controls the actual determined peer to peer transmission power level to be less than or equal to the maximum peer to peer transmission power level.<br>
[00107]     Wide area network transmission power control module 2936 controls transmission power of a signal transmitted to the base station to a transmission power level which is greater than said peer to peer transmission power level used for at least some peer to peer signal transmission. WAN transmission power control module 2936 includes a second function 2938 which is different irom the first function 2934.

 <br>
[00108]     For example, received base station signal N 2944 which was communicated in a base station downlink band is measured by measurement module 2926 obtaining signal N measurement information 2948 which is input to both peer to peer transmission power control module 2928 and WAN transmission power control module 2936. Peer to peer module 2928 uses first function 2934 to process input 2948 and obtains a determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level 2952, while WAN module 2936 processes the same input 2948 using the second function 2938 and obtains a determined maximum WAN transmission power level 2956 which is a higher level than the determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level 2952.<br>
[00109]     In various embodiments, the peer to peer transmission signal power ievei is at least lOdBs below the transmission power level of the signal transmitted to the base station. For example, determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level 2952 is a least lOdBs below determined maximum WAN transmission power level 2956 for the same value of measured base station signal. As another example, in some embodiments, if a wireless temiinal is at a location and has determined peer to peer transmission power level infonnation and WAN transmission power level information based on the same received base station signal measurement, the determined actual peer to peer transmission power level 2954 is at least 1 OdBs below the determined actual WAN transmission power level 2958,<br>

Data/information 2920 also includes peer to peer transmission authorization status information 2950 which indicates whether or not the wireless communications device 2900 is currently allowed to transmit peer to peer signals.   Data/information 2920 also includes a determined maximum peer to peer transmission power level 2952 which is the output of sub-module 2930 and a determined actual peer to peer transmission power level 2954 which is the output of sub-module 2932.<br>
[00111]     Timing/frequency structure information 2960, included as part of data/information 2920, includes uplink frequency band information 2962, e.g., WAN<br>

In this exemplary embodiment peer to peer communications signaling uses a WAN uplink frequency band being used by a base station with the peer to peer signals acting as interference to the WAN uplink signals directed to the base station. The reference and/or control signal, which is received in a downlink frequency band by wireless communications device 2900, is measured, and the measurement is utilized to control wireless communications device peer to peer transmission power level in an uplink frequency band. Information 2966 identifies which WAN downlink band carries this signal, and in some embodiments, identifies more specific information corresponding to the signal, e.g., a point in a recurring timing structure and/or specific tone information used to identify the signal.<br>
[00112]     In various embodiments in which the wireless communications device 2900 supports WAN communications, e.g., cellular communications, data/information 2920 also includes determined maximum WAN transmission power level information 2956 and determined actual WAN transmission power level information 2958, which are outputs of WAN traismission power control module 2936.<br>
[00113]     Figure 7 comprising the combination of Figure 7A and Figure 7B is a flowchart SOO of an exemplary method of operating a wireless communications device supporting peer to peer communications in a base station's WAN uphnk band in accordance with various embodiments.

[00114]     Operation proceeds from step 804 to step 806. In step 806, the vnreless communications device performs a measurement on the received signal, e.g., a signal power measurement. Operation proceeds from step 806 to step 808.<br>
[00115]     In step 808 the wireless communications device determines a transmission power level control parameter. In one exemplary embodiment step 808 includes sub-steps 810 and 812. In another exemplary embodiment step 808 includes<br>

[00116]     In sub-step 810, the wireless communications device accesses memory, including stored transmission power level control parameters corresponding to different service levels, and then in sub-step 812 the wireless communications device retrieves a stored transmission power corresponding to a service level corresponding to said wireless communications device.<br>
[00U7]     In sub-step 814, the wireless communications device recovers a control value from a signal received by said wireless communications device from said base station. In some embodiments, the signal from which Che control value is recovered is the first signal which was received in a downlink frequency band in step 804. Operation proceeds from sub-step 814 to one of sub-steps 816 and 818, In sub-step 816, the wireless communications device uses the recovered control value as the transmission power level control parameter. Alternatively, in sub-step 818, the wireless communications device calculates the transmission power level control parameter based on the recovered controJ value and a sen'ice level corresponding to the wireless terminal.<br>
[00118]     Operation proceeds from step 808 to step 820.

Operation proceeds from step 820 via connecting node A 822 to step 824.<br>
[00119]     In step 824, the wireless communications device receives a second signal from the base station, e.g., a second beacon signal or a second non-beacon broadcast chaimel signal, in said downlink frequency band at a time which is different from the time at which said first signal is received. Then, in step 826, the wireless communications device performs a measurement of the received second signal, e.g., a power measurement of the received second signal. Operation proceeds from step 826 to step 828, in which the wireless communications device determines from the measured<br>
 <br>
power of the second received signal that the wireless communications device should refrain from transmitting peer to peer communications signals in said uplink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 828 to step 830. In step 830, the wireless communications device refrains from transmitting peer to peer communications signals in said uplink frequency band afler determimng that the communications device should refrain from transmitting peer to peer communications signals until determining from measuring the power of another signal from the base station that the wireless communications device is permitted to transmit peer to peer signals.<br>

station with the peer to peer signals acting as interference to the WAN uplink signals directed to the base station, A signal which is received by wireless communications device 3000 in a base station WAN downlink frequency band is measured and the measurement utilized to control wireless communications device 3000 peer to peer transmission power level.   In some embodiments a signal which is received by wireless communications device 3000 and decoded recovery infonnation, e.g., recovering an interference indicator value, is also utilized to control wireless communications device 3000 peer to peer transmission power level.

Exemplary communications system 302 includes a base station 308 with a corresponding cellular coverage area represented by cell 310. The base station 308 is coupled to other network nodes, e.g., other base stations, routers, AAA nodes, home agent nodes, control nodes, etc., and/or the Internet via network link 309, e.g., a fiber optic link. In communications system 302 there are also a plurality of wireless terminals supporting cellular communications (WT 1 312, ,.., WTN314). Cellular WTs(312, 314) are coupled to base station 308 via wireless links (316,318), respectively.<br>
[00142]     In communications system 302 there are also apfurality of wireless terminals supporting peer to peer communications (WT 1', WT 2' 328, WT 3', WT 4'<br>
 <br>
340). WTT is shown at two points in time and is represented as element 324 at time tO and as element 326 at time tl. WT 1' motion is indicated by arrow 334. WT3' is shown at two points in time and is represented as element 336 at time tO and as element 338 at timetl. WT 3'motion is indicated by arrow 346. Peer to peer communications between WTT and WT2' 328 are indicated by arrows 330 and 332. Peer to peer communications between WT3' and WT4' 340 are indicated by arrows 342 and 344.<br>
[00343]     The base station transmits a broadcast signal 320, e.g., a beacon signal or a non-beacon broadcast channel signal, into a downlink WAN frequency band of the base station. The broadcast signal, e.g., beacon signal, is detected and measured by the peer to peer wireless terminals. A power measurement of the received broadcast signal, e.g., beacon signal, is used by a peer to peer wireless terminal to determine whether the wireless terminal is allowed to transmit peer to peer signals into a corresponding WAN uplink frequency band and to control the transmission power level, e.g., the maximum transmission power level, when transmission is permitted into the corresponding uplink frequency band. Dotted arrow circle 322 around base station 308 indicates an exemplary peer to peer restricted region, where a peer to peer wireless terminal is restricted from transmitting signals. In the region close to the base station 308, transmissions from peer to peer wireless terminals at levels utilized in the peer to peer signaling can produce too much interference from the perspective of the base station receiver attempting to recover and decode uplink signals from wireless terminals operatifig in a cellular mode (312,... 314), and thus peer to peer wireless terminal transmissions are not permitted.<br>

First column 348 indicates that frequency band A is used as; (i) a cellular downlink band for signals transmitted from the base station intended to be received by cellular wireless terminals and (ii) for communicating a broadcast reference and/or control signal intended to be used by peer to peer wireless terminals, e.g., a beacon signal intended for control of peer to peer communications, e.g., power control of peer to peer communications in a corresponding uplink frequency band. Second column 350 indicates that frequency band B is used as: (i) a cellular uplink band for signals transmitted from cellular wireless terminals intended to be received by the base stations; and (ii) as a peer to peer band intended to be used for signals transmitted from and intended to be received by peer to peer wireless terminals.<br>

[00145]     Peer to peer wireless terminal power information table 306 will now be described. First column 352 identifies the exemplary peer to peer wireless terminals (WT r, WT 2', WT 3', WT 4') being described. Second column 354 identifies points in time, either tO or tl. Third column 356 identifies transmission power level information corresponding to the wireless terminal on the same row corresponding to the time indicated on the same row. The information of table 306 indicates that the transmission power level for WTl' increases from timetO to timetl. It may be observed that WTl' moves away from the base station 308 during this time and that the measured power level of beacon signal 320 from WTl' s perspective can be expected to decre&amp;se during this time. It may also be observed that WT 1' remains outside the restricted zone 322 during this time. The information of table 306 also indicates that the transmission power level for WT3' decreases from time tO to time tl. It may be observed that WT3' moves toward the base station 308 during this time and that the measured power level of beacon signal 320 from WT3' s perspective can be expected to increase during this time. It may also be observed that WT 3' remains outside the restricted zone 322 during this time. The power level described in table 306 can be a maximum allowable transmission power level for the wireless terminal. Alternatively, the power level described in table 306 can be an actual transmission power level.<br>

In various embodiments, the second function determines a higher transmission power level than the first function for a given value of the measured received signal power. In some such embodiments, the difference in dBs between tlie transmission power determined by the first and second function for a given value of the measured received signal power is at least 10 dBs.<br>
[00152]     Wireless teni^inal 3 408 includes a yeceived signal power measurement module 436, a peer to peer signal transmission power control module 438, and a wide area network signal transmission power control module 440. Received signal power measurement module 436 measures the power level of a signal received from a base station, in a downlink frequency band. Peer to peer signal transmission power control module 438 controls a peer to peer signal transmission power level in a base station uplink frequency band as a function of the measured power of the signal from a base station in accordance with a first function. Wide area network signal transmission power control module 440 controls wide area signal transmission power level in a base station uplink frequency band as a function of the measured power of a signal from the base station in accordance with a second function, said second function being different from said first function. In various embodiments, the second function used by module 440 determines a higher transmission power level than the first function used by module 438 for a given value of the measured received signal power. In some such embodiments, the difference in dBs between the transmission power determined by the first and second function for a given value of the measured received signal power is at least 10 dBs.   In some embodiments, the first function used by module 438 of WT 3 408 is the same as the first function used by module 424 of WT 1 404. In some embodiments, the second function used by module 440 of WT 3 408 is the same as the second function used by module 434 of WT 2 406.<br>
[00153]     Figure 1! is a flowchart 500 of an exemplary method of operating abase station in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 502 and proceeds to step 504. In step 504, the base stafion stores interference budget information. Operation proceeds from step 504 to steps 506 and step 508.<br>
100154)     In step 508, which is performed on an ongoing basis, the base station is operated to maintain synchronization with at least one adjacent base station to maintain<br>
 <br>
synchronization of uplink nuU time periods between adjacent base stations. In various embodiments, an uplink null time period is a period of time in which at least a fraction of uplink bandwidth used by the base station is intentionally not used for transmitting upJink signals to the base station.<br>
[00155]     Returning to step 506, in step 506, the base station measures during an uplink null time period background interference. Then, in step 510, the base station determines a first uplink transmission power control value as a function of the measured background interference. Step 510 includes sub-step 512. In sub-step 512, the base station uses the stored interference budget information in combination with said measured background interference to generate the first uplink transmission power control value. Sub-step 512 includes sub-steps 514, 516, 518, and 520. In sub-step 514, the base station determines if the measured background interference exceeds an interference budget limit indicated by the stored interference budget information. If the budget limit is exceeded, then operation proceeds from sub-step 514 to sub-step 516; otherwise operation proceeds from sub-step 514 to sub-step 518.<br>
[00156]     In sub-step 516, the base station modifies a previous upVink transmission power control value, said modified transmission power control value limiting peer to peer transmission power levels more than the previous uplink transmission power control value. Returning to sub-step 5! 8, in sub-step 518, the base stadon determines if the measured background interference is below said interference budget limit indicated by stored interference budget information, e.g., lower by at least a predeCennined threshold value. If it is determined in sub-step 518, tliat the measured background interference is below the interference budget limit such as to sadsfy the test criteria, then operation proceeds from sub-step 518 to sub-step 520. In sub-step 520, the base station modifies the previous uplink transmission power control value, said modified transmission power control value increasing peer to peer transmission power levels to a level higher than the levels controlled by the previous transmission power control value.<br>
[00157]     Operation proceeds from step 510 to step 522, in which the base station transmits said determined first uplink transmission power control value into a downlink frequency band.<br>
[00158]     Figure 12 is a flowchart 600 of an exemplary method of operating abase station in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 6D2 and proceeds to step 604. In step 604, the base station stores<br>
 <br>
interference budget information. Operation proceeds from step 604 to steps 606 and step 608.<br>
[00159]     In step 608, which is performed on an ongoing basis, the base station is operated to maintain synchronization with at least one adjacent base station to maintain synchronization of uplink null time periods between adjacent base stations. In various embodiments, an uplink null time period is a period of time in which at least a fraction of uplink bandwidth used by the base station is intentionally not used for transmitting uplink signals to the base station.<br>
[00160]     Returning to step 606, in step 606, the base station measures during a first uplink null time period background interference. Then, in step 610, the base station determines a first uplink transmission power control value as a function of the measured background interference. Operation proceeds from step 610 to step 612. In step 612, the base station transmits said determined first uplink transmission power control value into a downlink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 612 to step 614.<br>
[00161]     In step 614, the base station measures during a second uplink null time period background interference, and then in step 616, the base station determines a change in the measured background interference from the measurements corresponding to the first upUnk null period and the second uplink null period. Operation proceeds from step 616 to step 618.<br>
[00162]     In step 618, the base station determines a second uplink transmission power control value as a function of the measured background interference corresponding to the second uplink null period and the determined change in measured background interference, and then in step 620, the base station fransmits the determined second uplink transmission power control value into the downlink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 620 to step 622.<br>
[00163J     In step 622, the base station measures, during a third uplink null period, background interference, and in step 624 the base station determines a change in the measured background interference from the measurements corresponding to the second uplink null period and the third uplink null period. Operation proceeds from step 624 to step 626, in which the base station determines a difference between the first uplink transmission power control value and the second uplink transmission power control value. Operation proceeds from step 626 to step 628.<br>
 <br>
[00164]     In step 628, the base station determines a third uplink transmission power control value as a function of the measured background interference corresponding to the third uplink null period, the determined change in measured background interference between the second and third uplink null periods, and the determined difference between the two previously transmitted power control values. Operation proceeds from step 628 to step 630, in which the base station transmits the determined third uplink transmission power control value into the downlink frequency band.<br>
[00165]     Figure 13 is a drawing of an exemplary base station 2800 in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary base station 2800 manages reception interference from peer to peer wireless terminals transmitting into the same air link resources used for its wide area network uplink communications. Exemplary base station 2800 determines and transmits into a downlink frequency band an uplink power control signal utilized by peer to peer wireless terminals in determining their transmission power level. In some embodiments, the uplink power control signal transmitted into the downlink frequency band by the base station 2800 is also utilized by wireless terminals, using the base station as a point of network attachment and transmitting uplink signals to the base station, to control transmission power levels.<br>
[00166]     Exemplary base station 280O includes a receiver module 2802, a transmitter module 2804, a processor 2806. an I/O interface 2808, and a memory 2810 coupled together via a bus 2812 over which the various elements may interchange data and information.<br>
[00167] Receiver module 2802, e.g., an OFDM receiver, is coupled to receive antenna 2814 via which the base station 2800 receives uplink signals from wireless terminals, e.g., wireless terminals functioning in a cellular mode and using the base station 2800 as a point of network attachment. Receiver module 2802 also receives interference from peer to peer communications devices operating in the local vicinity, in some embodiments, receiver module 2802 also receives interference from uplink signaling from cellular devices in adjacent cells.<br>
[00168]     Transmitter module 2804, e.g., an OFDM transmitter, is coupled to transmit antenna 2816, via which the base station 2800 transmits downlink signals to wireless terminals using base station 2800 as a point of network attachment. Transmitter module 2804 also transmits, into a base station downhnk band, uplink transmission power control value signals to be used by peer to peer wireless terminals to<br>
 <br>
control their transmission power level, the peer to peer wireless terminals using the base station's uplink band for peer to peer signaling and thus producing interference from the perspective of the base station receiver module 2802,<br>
[00169]     Memory 2810 includes routines 2818 and data/information 2820. The processor 2806, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 2818 and uses the data/information 2820 in memory 2810 to control the operation of the base station 2800 and implement methods. Routines 2818 include a communications routine 2822, an interference measurement module 2824, a wireless terminal power control module 2826, and a wireless terminal power control signal transmission module 2830. In some embodiments, routines 2818 include one or more of wide area network synchronization module 2828 and interference type separation module 2832.<br>
[00170]     Communications routine 2822 implements various communications protocols used by the base station 2800. Interference measurement module 2824 measures during uplink null time periods background interference. Wireless terminal power control module 2826 determines uplink transmission power control values as a function of measured background interference. In various embodiments, the wireless terminal power control module 2826 determines an uphnk power control value using stored interference budget information in combination with the measured background interference to generate the uplink transmission power control value. Wireless terminal power control signal transmission control module 2830 controls the transmitter module 2804 to transmit a generated uplink transmission power control signal, e.g., first uplink transmission power control value 2850, In some embodiments, the control module 2830 controls the transmitter module 2804 to transmit, into a base station downlink frequency band, a generated uplink transmission power control value in accordance with a recurring schedule. In some embodiments, the control module 2830 controls transmission as a function of interference level information. In some embodiments, wireless tenninal power control module 2826 determines an uplink transmission power control value as a function of the measured background interference and a change in the measiu-ed background interference from a previous measurement. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal power control module 2826 determines an uplink transmission power control value as a function of the difference between two previously transmitted power control values.<br>
 <br>
[00171]     In some embodiments, the wireless terminal power control module 2826 determines an uplink transmission power control value by operations including modifying a previous uplink transmission power control value when the measured background interference exceeds an interference budget limit indicated by the stored interference budget information, the modified transmission power control value limiting peer to peer transmission power levels more than the previous uplink transmission power control value. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal power control module 2826 determines an uplink transmission power control value by operations including modifying a previous uplink transmission power control value when the measured background interference is below an interference budget limit indicated by the stored interference budget information, the modified transmission power control value increasing peer to peer transmission power levels more than the previous uplink transmission power control value. In various embodiments, the changing to a higher level is performed when said measured interference is below said interference budget limit by at least a predetermined threshold,<br>
[00172]     Thus the value of the uplink transmission power control value is used by base station 2800 to regulate the transmission power level of peer to peer communications, thereby impacting interference to uplink signals being directed to base station 2800 in a base station uplink frequency band.<br>
[00173]     Wide area network synchronization module 2828 is used for maintaining synchronization with at least one adjacent base station to maintain synchronization of uplink nu]l time periods between adjacent base stations.<br>
[00174]     Interference type separation module 2832 is used to obtain an estimate of the amount of uplink interference contribution sourced from peer to peer communications. In some embodiments, the interference type separation module 2832 intentionally inputs a controlled change level in the uplink transmission power control value and calculates an observed effect in the interference measurement during a subsequent upUnk null period as part of separating the peer to peer interference from other interference sources, e.g., cellular communications devices transmitting uplink signals in an adjacent cell which is not synchronized with respect to base station 2800.<br>
[00175] Data/information 2820 includes time/frequency structure information 2834, stored interference budget information 2840, a plurality of sets of interference measurement information (uplink interference measurement information 1 2846,...,<br>
 <br>
uplink interference measurement information N 2848), and a plurality of generated uplink transmission power control values (first uplink transmission power control value 2850,..,, Mth uplink transmission power control value 2852).<br>
[001761     Timing/irequency structure information 2834 includes recurring time structure information 2836, The recurring time structure information 2836 includes information identifying uplink null time periods 2838. In some embodiments, an uplink null time period corresponds to a period of time in which at least a fraction of uplink bandwidth used by said base station is intentionally not used for transmitting uplink signals to the base station. In some embodiments, an uplink null time period is a time period during which wireless terminals, e.g., cellular communications devices, using the base station 2800 attachment point intentionally refrain from sending uplink signals to the base station 2S00. During this time period peer to peer wireless terminal signaling continues using the uplink frequency band. Thus, the base station 2800 can measure background interference during this period. If adjacent base stations are synchronized such that uplink null periods are concurrent, then the measured noise during these periods can be associated with peer to peer signaling. However, if adjacent base stations are not synclironized. and the same uplink band is used, then the measured interference during such an uplink null period includes interference from both peer to peer wireless terminals and cellular communications devices corresponding to adjacent base stations.<br>
[00177]     Stored interference budget information 2840 includes background interference limit information 2842 and threshold information 2844,<br>
[00178]     Figure 14 is a drawing 900 including an exemplary cormnunications system 902 and a frequency band usage table 904 in accordance with various embodiments. In the exemplary communications system 900 a wide area network shares bandwidth with peer to peer communications. In various embodiments, the wide area network corresponds to a deployed system and the peer to peer capabilities involve add on and/or upgrade features. In some embodiments, the exemplary communications system 902 is initially deployed including both WAN and peer to peer capabilities. Frequency band usage table 904 indicates two types of embodiments which can correspond to exemplary system 902, In the first type of embodiment, type A embodiments, the wide area network uses frequency division duplex (FDD), the wide area frequency division duplex uplink band shares bandwidth with peer to peer<br>
 <br>
communications activities, and the WAN FDD downlink band communicates WAN downlink signals and a broadcast signal used for peer to peer device control. In the second type of embodiment, type B embodiments, the wide area network uses time division duplex (TDD) with the same frequency band being used for uplink and downlink with respect to the WAN signaling, the wide area band shares an uplink time slot with peer to peer communications activities, and the wide area network shares a downlink time slot to communicate a broadcast signal for peer to peer device control. Thus, in both types of embodiments, uplink signaling from the wide area network communications devices can interfere with reception of peer to peer communications signals by a peer lo peer communications device, and the peer to peer communications signals directed between peer to peer communications devices can interfere with the reception of wide area network uplink signals at the base station, in addition, the contro] signal transmitted from Ihe base station intended to be used by peer to peer devices is communicated using resources typically reserved for downlink WAN signaling.<br>
[00] 79]     Exemplai-y communications system 902 includes a base station 906, a wide area network wireless terminal 908, e.g., a cellular mobile node, a first peer to peer wireless terminal 910, and a second peer to peer wireless terminal 912. For the purposes of illustration consider that wide area network wireless terminal 908 transmits uplink signal 914 to base station 906. Base station 906 receives this signal and measures the received signal as Pci- The signal 914 from the perspective of peer to peer wireless terminal 2 912 is viewed as interference 916 from the wide area network wireless terminal 908. Now consider that the first peer to peer wireless terminal 910 transmits peer to peer signal 918 to peer to peer wireless terminal 2 912. The signal 918 from the perspective of base station 906 is viewed as interference 920 from first peer to peer wireless terminal 910. Base station 906 receives this interference and measures the received signal as Ppi-<br>
|00180]     In accordance with various embodiments, priority is given to the wide area system, and interference is managed at the base station. For example, a power control value a is chosen to achieve a goal such as (Pp|/Pci) 
 <br>
terminal uplink signaling, it is to be understood that there may be, and sometimes are, a pluralit)' of peer to peer wireless terminals transmitting and contributing to the interference, and there may be, and sometimes are, a plurality of wide area network wireless terminals transmitting uplink signals to the base station, which the base station is attempting to recover. Thus, the control factor a, determined by the base station to manage interference can be, and sometimes is, dependent upon multiple users. In some embodiments, the control factor a depends on the number of users, e.g., the number of active wide area network users and/or the number of active peer to peer users.<br>
[001811     Figure 15 is a drawing 1002 illustrating a feature of various embodiments, in which a wide area network has a silent period in which the base station monitors for and measures peer to peer noise. Exemplary drawing 1002 includes a base station 1004 having a corresponding cellular coverage area 1006. In some embodiments the cellular coverage area has a radius of at least 1 kilometer. Within the cell, there is a plurality of wireless terminals functioning in a cellular mode of operation (WT A 1008, WTBIOIO, WTC1012,WTD1014). These wireless terminals (1008,1010, 1012, 1014) receive downlink signals from base station 1004 and transmit uplink signals to base station 1004. However, this point in time corresponds to an intentional wide area network uplink silent period where the wide area network wireless terminals (1008, 1010, 1012, 1014) do not transmh any uplink signals.<br>
[00182]     The cell 1006 also includes aplurality of wireless terminals functioning in the peer to peer mode of operation (WTl I0I6, WT2 iOI8, WT3 1020, WT4 1022). Peer to peer communications are not restricted during this time period. Peer to peer WT 11016 happens to be transmitting a peer to peer signal 1024 to peer to peer wireless terminal 2 1018. This transmitted peer to peer signal 1024 is viewed as peer to peer noise interference signal 1026 from the perspective of the receiver in base station 1004. Peer to peer WT 3 1020 happens to be transmitting a peer to peer signal 1028 to peer to peer wireless terminal 4 1022. This transmitted peer to peer signal 1028 is viewed as peer to peer noise interference signal 1030 from the perspective of the receiver in base station 1004,<br>
[00183]     Figure 16 is a drawing 1102 illustrating several features of various embodiments, and is a continuation of the example of Figure 15. In cell 1006, the base station 1004 determines a power control value a as a fimction of the measured peer to peer interference. The base station then broadcasts, using WAN downlink air link<br>
 <br>
resources, this control value a via signal 1104 to be used by the wireless terminals. In this exemplary embodiment, the base station broadcasts a single value for control value a; however, the value a. can be, and sometimes is, used differently by the different wireless communications devices receiving the broadcast signal ] ] 04. In this example, the set of wireless terminals operating in the cellular mode (WT A 1008, WT B 1010, WT C 1012, WT D 1014) uses a first power control function, fi(a) 1106, to determine a transmission power level control parameter; while the set of wireless terminals operating in the peer to peer mode (WT 1 1016, WT2 1018, WT 3 1020, WT 4 1022) use a second power control flmction, fzio.) 1108, to determine a transmission power control parameter.<br>
[00184]     Figure 17 is a drawing of an exemplary look-up table for control values 1200 illustrating a feature of various embodiments. In some embodiments, a wireless tenninal receives a broadcast power control value from a base station in a downhnk frequency band and determines its own power control value to use as a function of the received value and a corresponding service level. Different service levels may, and sometimes do, correspond to different traftic types, different types of services, and/or to different users of the service, and map to different service levels. For example, exemplary different priorities, in some embodiments, are associated with different traffic types, e.g., voice, latency critical data, and best effort type data. Exemplary different types of service include, e.g., emergency corrmiunications services and ordinary communications. Different types of users include, e.g., high priority users such as pohce, fire, emergency services, medium priority users having subscribed to a high service level plan, and low priority users having subscribed to a low service level plan. Thus in some embodiments, a recovered power control value is modified as a function of priority level.<br>
[00185]     In exemplary table 1200, first column 1202 indicates exemplary received control values a, second colurrm 1204 indicates exemplary corresponding service level 1 control values Oi, third column 1206 indicates exemplary corresponding service level 2 control values a2, and fourth column 1208 indicates exemplary corresponding service level 3 control values a^. First row 1210 indicates that if a wireless terminal using look¬up table 1200 receives a broadcast power control value from a base station which indicates -10 dB and its corresponding service level is (service level 1, service level 2, service level 3), then it uses (-lOdB, -15 dB, -20 dB), respectively, for its power control<br>
 <br>
value. Second row 1212 indicates that if a wireless terminal using look-up table 1200 receives a broadcast power control value from a base station which indicates -20dB and its corresponding service level is {service ievei I, service level 2, service level 3), then it uses (-20 dB, -25 dB, -30 dB), respectively, for its power control value. Third row 1214 indicates that if a wireless terminal using look-up table 1200 receives a broadcast power control value from a base station which indicates -30dB and its corresponding service level is (service level 1, service level 2, service level 3), then it uses (-30dB, -35 dB, -40 dB), respectively, for its power control value.<br>
[00186]     Figure 18 is a flowchart 1300 of an exemplary method of operating a base station in accordance with various embodiments, e.g., a base station in which its uplink bandwidth is also utilized for peer to peer signaling. The base station is, e.g., a base station, operating as part of a cellular communications system in which operations are synchronized between adjacent base stations. Synchronization between adjacent base stations facilitates the implementation of universal uplink null periods, in which wide area network wireless terminal cell uplink signaling can be controlled to universally stop. These null periods are utilized for the measurement of background interference. In such an embodiment, the background interference W can be approximated by W = thermal noise + peer to peer noise. The base station desires to control interference, and determines and broadcasts, into a downlink frequency band, a power control factor a, to be received by the wireless terminals in its vicinity.<br>
[00187]     Operation starts in step 1302, where the base station is powered on and initialized. In some embodiments, the initialization includes the use of a default value for power control factor a, which is broadcast, in a downlink frequency band, to the wireless terminals. Operation proceeds from start step 1302 to step 1304. In step 1304, the base station measures background interference, W, during a null interval, e.g., an uplink null interval in which WAN wireless terminals are controlled to refrain from signaling.<br>
[001881     Operation proceeds from step 1304 to step 1306. In step 1306, the base station detemiines a power control factor a as a function of the measured background interference. In various embodiments, the function used is such that as W increases, a increases for at least some non-null range of W. In some embodiments, the determination of step 1306 includes a comparison with stored interference budget information. Operation proceeds from step 1306 to step 1308.<br>
 <br>
[00189]     In step 1308, the base station broadcasts the determined power control factor a into a downlink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 1308 to step 1304, where another measurement of background interference is performed.<br>
[00190]     In some embodiments, multiple measurements of background interference are performed and used corresponding to multiple null intervals in generating a determined power control factor which is broadcast. Thus in some embodiments, the base station performs a set of background measurements, e.g., multiple iterations of step 1304, corresponding to a set of null intervals before broadcasting a determined power control factor in step 1308.<br>
(00191J     Figure ] 9 is a flowchart 1400 of an exemplary method of operating a base station in accordance with various embodiments, e.g., a base station in which its uplink bandwidth is also utilized for peer to peer signaling. The base station is, e.g., a base station, operating as part of a cellular communications system in which operations are not synchronized between adjacent base stations. In the uplink timing structure used by the base station uplink null periods are utilized by the base station to measure background interference. However, since operations in neighboring cells are not synchronized, the interference levels from the neighboring cells may vary over time making it more difficuh to extract the peer to peer component of background interference, than would be the case if the adjacent base stations were synchronized and were also controlled to have intentional uplink nulls occurring concurrently. The base station desires to control interference, and determines and broadcasts a power control factor a, to be received by the wireless terminals in its vicinity. In accordance with a feature of this embodiment, the base station intentionally varies the broadcast power control factor which it broadcasts, as a controlled input, in order to measure response.<br>
[00192]     Operation starts in step 1402, where the base station is powered on and initialized, and proceeds to step 1404. In step ! 404, the base station broadcasts a power control factor ai into a downlink frequency band. At this point ai is a default value obtained from initialization. Then, in step 1406, the base station measures background interference Wi during a null interval, e.g., an uplink WAN null interval in which wireless communications devices using the base station are intentionally restricted from transmitting uplink signals. Operation proceeds from step 1406 to step 1408.<br>
[00193]     In step 1408, the base station adjusts the power control factor to determine a second power control factor a;. For example, a; = ai + Aa, where Aa is a<br>
 <br>
non-zero value and can be positive or negative. Typically Aa has a magnitude which is a small fraction of the magnitude of aj, e.g., less than or equal to 25% of a:. Operation proceeds from step 1408 to step 1410, in which the base station transmits the new power control factor a: into the downlink frequency band. Operation proceeds from step 1410 to step 1412.<br>
[00194]     In step 1412, the base station measures background interference Wi during a null interval. Operation proceeds from step 1412 to step 1414. In step 1414, the base station determines power control factor a^ as a function of the change in the measured background interference and the change in the power control factors which were transmitted. For example 03 is determined as a function of AW and Aa, where AW = W2 -Wi. In one exemplary embodiment, 03 is one of; ctj = 02 + Aa and aj = ai - Aa. Operation proceeds from step 1414 to step 1416, where the base station sets ai =03. Then operation proceeds to step 1404, where the base station broadcasts the power control factor ai into the downlink frequency band.<br>
[00195]     Figure 20 is a drawing of a plot 1500 of noise W on vertical axis 1502 vs a on horizontal axis 1504. Noise W, which represents receive noise at a base station attempting to recover uplink signals, inckfdes peer to peer noise and other ceJl interference. The variable a is a power control factor. Curve 1506 is a characteristic curve of W vs a corresponding to other cell interference level 1508. During an intentional uplink null time inierva! corresponding to a first base station, the first base station intentionally controls wireless terminals using it as a point of network attaeliment to refrain from uplink signaling. During this intentional uplink nuU time interval, peer to peer activity within the cell is allowed to continue. 71ius the peer to peer activity is treated by the first base station receiver as noise and contributes to the measured noise W.<br>
[00196J     Now consider that an adjacent base station is operating asynchronously with respect to the first base station. Since the adjacent base station is asynchronous with respect to the first base station, intentional uplink null time intervals of the adjacent base station do not necessary overlap intentional null time intervals of the first base station. Thus uplink signaling of the adjacent base station also contributes to the measured noise W measured by the first base station during intenfional uplink null periods of the first base station.<br>
 <br>
[00197]     Characteristic W vs a curve 1506 corresponds to a given level of other cell interference 1508, which represents a minimum level of interference. If operating on a point of the curve 1506 near saturation, then increases in a do not give significant improvement in reduction in noise W. An increase in a corresponds to a limiting of transmission power for peer to peer signaling. Thus, under such conditions, additionally restricting peer to peer transmission power levels does not significantly improve reception of the uplink signals from cellular wireless terminals. However; if operating on a point of curve 1506 having a high value for slope, a small increase in a can give a significant change decrease in the level of noise W. Under such condhions, at times, it may be beneficial to decrease a such as to improve recovery of the uplink signals from cell based wireless terminals. For example, a small throttling back of peer to peer transmission power levels, can, under such conditions, result in a significant improvement in uplink signaling recovery and/or throughput.<br>
[00198]     In general, in various embodiments, good wide area, e.g., cellular, based communications reception is given priority over the peer to peer signaling. However, it is desirable that the peer to peer communications throughput be maximized given a particular Isval of desired cell based uplink reception quality. It may be observed that W vs a characteristic curve will change as a flinction of the other cell interference. The other cell interference may, and sometimes does, change independently of the first cell operation. For example, due to: conditions, the number of cellular based wireless terminal users in the adjacent cell, adjacent cell uplink traffic load, etc., the other cell interference experienced by the first base station may change to a different level. Plot 1600 of Figure 21 illush-ates a different level of other cell interference 1608 as compared to other cell interference level 1508 of Figure 20. In addition Figure 21 illustrates a different characteristic curve 1606 as compared to characteristic curve 1506.<br>
[00199]     Figure 22 illustrates an exemplary method of adjusting Che selection of power control factor a used in various embodiments in response to noise measurements. Figure 22 is a plot 1700 of noise W on vertical axis 1502 vs a on horizontal axis 1504 corresponding to characteristic curve 1506. At the time of operation, the first base station may be unaware that the first base station is operating on characteristic curve 1506 corresponding to other cell interference level 1508 of Figure 20, with curve 1506 being one of a family of curves including curve i506 and curve 1606 of Figure 21.<br>
 <br>
[00200]     The first base station sets a to an initial value a, 1702, which is broadcast into a downlink frequency band. The value ai 1702 is used by the peer to peer wireless terminals in the first base station's cell to control their peer to peer transmission power in a corresponding uplink frequency band. During an intentional uplink null period of the first base station, the first base station measures the receive noise level W as Wi 1706. Then, the first base station intentionally changes the value of ai by an amount Aa 1708, to obtain aj 1710. This represents a controlled input used to intentionally drive the receive noise level to a different point (from 1704 to 1712) on the characteristic cur\e 1506. The first base station broadcasts the parameter ai 1710 into the downlink frequency band. The value a^ 1710 is used by the peer to peer wireless terminals in the first base station's cell to control their peer to peer transmission power in the uplink frequency band. During an inlentiona] uplink nul) period of the first base station, the first base station measures the receive noise level W as W2 1714. The first base station measures the change in W, AW 1716. The first base station then decides upon a new value for a as a function of the input driving value Aa 1708, the measured response AW 1716, and some stored interference budget information. In some embodiments, the first base station decides upon the new value for a as a function of at (east one noise measurement point, e.g., Wj or W2. In this example, the first base station sets the new value for a, 03 to aa = oi - Aa if AW is small as indicated by point 1718; while, the first base station sets the new value for a, 03 to ai=ci2 + Aa if AW is large as indicated by point 1720, e.g., with the small and large determination being with respect to predetermined stored interference budget information. The power control factor ay is then broadcast into the downlink frequency band by the first base station to be used by the peer 10 peer wireless terminals in the cell to control their transmission power levels into the uplink frequency band.<br>
[00201]     Figure 23 is a drawing 1800 illustrating exemplary bandwidth usage in some embodiments utilizing a time division duplex (TDD) for the wide area network, e.g., for the cellular communications. With respect to the wide area network, e.g., corresponding to a base station, the same frequency band is shared, e.g., in an alternating pattern between uphnk and downlink. For example, the TDD band used for the wide area, e.g., cellular communications, is used for (uplink, downlink, uplink, downlink) as indicated by blocks (1804, 1806,1808, 1810), respectively, along time line 1802, In addition to typical cellular based activities, the base station transmits a<br>
 <br>
peer to peer reference and/or control broadcast signal(s), e.g., a beacon signal and/or other broadcast signals, during an interval typically reserved for wide area downlink signaling. This is represented by signals (1812, 1814) corresponding to time intervals for blocks (1806, 1810), respectively. In addition, time intervals designated to be used for wide area network, e.g., cellular uplink, are also used for peer to peer signaling, with the same TDD band being used, as indicated by cellular uplink blocks (1804, 1808) being concurrent with peer to peer blocks (1816, 1818), respectively,<br>

[00203]     In addition to the typical cellular based uplink signaling in the FDD wide area uplink band, the band is used for other activities related to peer to peer signaling. In Figure 24, the FDD wide area downlink band 1906 is also used by the base station to transmit peer-peer broadcast reference and/or control signa!(s) 1908, e.g., a beacon signal and'or other broadcast signals are transmitted by the base station to be used by peer to peer wireless terminals. Peer to peer wireless terminals also use the same band for peer to peer signaling as indicated by block 1910 located on frequency axis 1902 corresponding to FDD wide area uplink band 1904.<br>
