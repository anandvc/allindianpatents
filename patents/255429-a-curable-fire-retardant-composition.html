				<td>The present invention relates to a curable fire retardant composition. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fire retardant composition and to the use of this composition in the production of a cured laminate having self-extinguishing properties and good mechanical properties.<br>
Background of the Invention The demand for plastic materials continues to grow in diverse industries such as automotive, aerospace, civilian, military and manufacturing, with applications such as home and office furniture and wall coverings, auto, rail, marine, and airplane interiors, cabinetry and casing, supports for electronic and computer systems and various components for machines and cookware. As a result of this growth, there is an increasing demand for fire retardant, smoke repressant plastic materials since accidental fires continue to extract a heavy toll on life and property. Unfortunately, thermoplastic and thermosetting resins, being organic in nature, are inherently combustible. This deficit has been addressed in the past, most notably by incorporating various halogen or phosphorous fire retardant additives into the plastic composition.<br>
A fire retardant composition is a composition containing at least one component/compound/additive able to diminish or delay the combustion of the cured composition. A Fire retardant object can delay or diminish the flame (flame retardant), smoke (smoke repressant) and/or transmission of the combustion (fire screening). Preferably, a fire retardant composition adresses at least the aspect of flame retardancy.<br>
However, the addition of such fire retardant additives generally detracts from the desirable mechanical properties of the plastic materials. For example, it is known that phosphorus-based fire retardant additives enhance the fire retardant character of various plastics when incorporated therein, but it has been found that the amounts of additive required severely degrade the strength and impact resistance of the compositions relative to virgin resins.<br>
In addition, the toxicity of traditional fire retardant additives is a major concern. Prepregs, resin coated conductive foils, reinforced cores, and other substrates used in the manufacture of circuit boards typically include flammable resin components. Halogenated flame-retardants, such as bromine compounds, are added to these resins prior to use to produce flame retardant circuit board substrates and laminates. However, the use of halogen containing flame-retardant compounds in circuit board substrate resin formulations produces hazardous problems when used circuit board components are disposed of in landfills since there is the possibility that the halogens may leach from the circuit board components into the environment.<br>
As a result, global initiatives are banning the use of many commercially-available flame-retardant resin systems that contain halogenated compounds, such as pentabromodiphenyl ether, since it is classified as a persistent (bioaccumulating) organic pollutant. Similarly, the use of antimony<br>
compounds such as antimony trioxide, often used synergistically with halogenated flame retardants,<br>
is being restricted due to toxicity concerns.<br>
It has been reported that silicone resins may be combined with fillers to produce low<br>
flammability composite materials. Chao et al., "Development of Silicone Resins for Use in<br>
Fabricating Low Flammability Composite Materials," 42nd International SAMPE Symposium, May<br>
4-8, 1997. However, in contrast to well known organic resin-based composites, silicone composites<br>
are expensive and would be expected to have less desirable mechanical properties. In general,<br>
silicones are not readily compatible with organic resins. Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to<br>
find silicone resins that are compatible with low viscosity engineering resins for use in the production<br>
of composite materials.<br>
WO 03/072656 relates to moulding composition which uses a mixture of silicone resins characterised<br>
by low melt viscosity [eg less than 10,000 mPasec-1 at 100C]. These are still paste like materials<br>
which require excessive heat to cause flow.<br>
US6177489 relates to melt mixed moulding compositions comprising epoxies, phenolic cure agent,<br>
silica and organosiloxane .<br>
EP1188794 relates to melt mixed mouldable composition comprising a thermoplastic resin, metal<br>
hydroxide, and a mixture of organosiloxanes.<br>
EP0918073 , and EP 1026204 likewise relates to melt kneaded mouldable composition comprising a<br>
synthetic resin having an aromatic group and 01 to 10 parts by wt siloxane compound.<br>
There exists a need in the art for plastic materials and adhesive resin formulations that have a<br>
high degree of fire retardancy while still being easily processed and that retain good mechanical<br>
properties without placing any reliance on the above mentioned conventional means to achieve fire<br>
retardant properties. By 'easily processed' is meant formulating liquid compositions which have low<br>
viscosities for machine dispensation of vacuum induced wetting. For example: best viscosity ranges<br>
for use in laminating and fiber wetting systems (low surface energy liquid spreading on higher<br>
surface energy fibers) is 500-10,000 cps, most preferably 1000-5000 cps at ambient temperatures, eg<br>
25C or 50C. Higher viscosities as described in prior art , eg from compositions which require melt<br>
mixing, for example, would undoubtedly give greater freedom in formulating fire retardant<br>
compositions , as high levels of oligomeric/polymeric materials, with or without aromatic character,<br>
could be used, including inorganic materials. However such pasty or liquid, high viscosity<br>
compositions are not always suitable for applications such as prepregs or laminating resins where the<br>
manufacturing process involve use of a curable composition which is fluid at room temperature.<br>
Moreover, pasty compositions require a time and energy consuming, melt mixing step at elevated<br>
temperature to ensure proper mixing of the components. We have found that suitable low viscosity<br>
mixture can be usefully achieved preferably with high level of siloxanes compounds provided these<br>
have compatibility with the cure-able part of the compositions.<br>
Furthermore, there is need for a fire resistant, halogen-free adhesive resin composition that produces<br>
circuit board substrate materials with high Tg's (glass transition temperatures), low Dk's (dielectric<br>
constants) and low moisture absorption properties.<br>
The present invention relates to a fire retardant composition that is especially useful for<br>
producing cured laminates that are flame retardant, smoke repressant and have good mechanical<br>
performance without the use of halogen or antimony additives.<br>

In another aspect, there is provided a process of producing a fire retardant laminate, the<br>
process comprising the steps of applying the fire retardant compositions described above to a<br>

An object of the present invention is to provide a fire retardant composition that produces or<br>
can be cured to produce polymers or polymer-based materials, for example, polyamides, nylons,<br>
polyesters, epoxy resins, phenoxy resins, ABS combinations, polyethylenes, polypropylenes,<br>
polyurethanes, polyureas, polyacrylates/polymethacrylates (homo- and copolymers), polystyrenes,<br>

laminar composites (e.g. for auto, rail, aerospace, and certain architectural applications).<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The composition of the present invention may be used to produce fire retardant materials<br>
with self-extinguishing properties and good mechanical properties.<br>
MONOMER, OLIGOMER OR POLYMER, OR ANY MIXTURE THEREOF<br>
Any desired monomer, oligomer or polymer, or any mixture thereof, is suitable for the<br>
present invention. Preferably, the monomer, oligomer or polymer, or any mixture thereof, will be one<br>
that is useful in the manufacture of adhesive resin coated metal foils. Preferably, the monomer,<br>
oligomer or polymer is organic and has a molecular weight greater than about 300. The fire retardant<br>
composition may include a combination of two or more monomers, oligomers or polymers having the<br>
same or different molecular weights and degrees of functionality. Such combinations can be<br>
advantageously combined in a formulation that results in a cured resin having a high Tg (glass<br>
transition temperature) and low Dk (dielectric constant).<br>
The monomer, oligomer or polymer (hereinafter referred to as "the base resin") preferably<br>
comprises functional groups selected from the group consisting of epoxy, acrylic, methacrylic, amine,<br>
hydroxyl, carboxyl, anhydride, olefinic, styrene, acetoxy, methoxy, ester, cyano, amide, imide,<br>
lactone, isocyanate, urethane and urea.<br>
Preferably, the base resin is liquid at 25C. This permits to form fire retardant curable<br>
composition at room temperature.<br>
Preferably, the composition does not contain a base resin in solid form, such as, for example,<br>
crystalline epoxies. Indeed these are not as easy to process by requiring melt mixing and tend to<br>
provide pasty-like or solid curable compositions.<br>
The monomer, oligomer or polymer, or mixture thereof preferably has a viscosity range from<br>
about 900 to 20,000 centipoise, more preferably from about 1200 to about 12,000 centipoise. All<br>
viscosity values given in the specification are measured at 25C unless another temperature is<br>
specifically mentioned.<br>
Examples of useful monomers, oligomers or polymers include bistriazine resins, phenoxy<br>
resins, bis-phenol epoxy resins, phenolic novolac resins, epoxidised phenolic novolac resins, urethane<br>
resins, polyvinyl acetate resins, and any other resins that alone or in combination are within the<br>
knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art as useful in adhesive resin compositions. Further<br>
examples of useful resins are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,611, 5,629,098, and 5,874,009, the<br>
specifications of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
More preferably, the monomer, oligomer or polymer contains aromatic groups.<br>
Most preferably, the monomer, oligomer or polymer is epoxy functional, particularly of<br>
viscosity less than 20,000 cps, most preferably less than 10,000 cps. Preferably, it has a low<br>
molecular weight (300-1000).<br>
Highly preferred is a mixture of low viscosity epoxies with two or more epoxy groups per<br>
molecule, as exemplified by bis-glycidyl bisphenol A, hydrogenated bisphenol A, bis-glycidyl<br>
bisphenol F, hydrogenated bisphenol F, epoxy novolac, cycloaliphatic epoxies, and tri- and terrafunctional<br>
glycidyl functional tertiary amines.<br>
The most highly preferred is a mixture of low viscosity bis-glycidyl epoxies of bisphenol A<br>
and bisphenol F, without reactive-epoxy diluents, for maximum cured laminate strength.<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention comprises about 40 to about 85<br>
percent by weight of the monomer, oligomer or polymer, or mixture thereof.<br>
COMPATIBLE SILOXANE<br>
The compatible siloxane of the present invention is a siloxane that is thoroughly miscible<br>
with the above-described the base resin or within a liquid solution of the base resin. Compatible<br>
siloxane can be solid or liquid at room temperature. In one embodiment, compatible siloxane in solid<br>
form is mixed within a liquid base resin. Preferably, siloxanes are so thoroughly miscible if, when<br>
mixed with the base resin, they produce a transparent mixture. Transparent mixtures preferably have<br>
a single Tg.<br>
Compatible siloxanes may be of low or high molecular weight. Low molecular weight<br>
siloxanes are more easily miscible with the base resin, however high molecular weight siloxanes tend<br>
to give better fire retardant properties. High molecular weight compatible siloxanes may be selected<br>
on the basis of functional groups that aid in making the molecule thoroughly miscible with the base<br>
resin. For example, it has been discovered that phenyl rings or epoxy-containing side chains on the<br>
silicon atoms of the siloxane backbone tend to increase its compatibility with aromatic monomers<br>
such as bisphenol A epoxies, bisphenol F epoxies and blends thereof. Examples of epoxy-compatible<br>
siloxanes are those in which the silicon atom of the repeating unit(s) is mono- or di-substituted by a<br>
phenyl group(s), or is methyl, phenyl di-substituted, or methyl substituted, phenyl di-substituted (e.g.<br>
glycidylpropopylphenyl), or methyl, glycidyl-propyl, di-substituted, provided in the latter case that<br>
the siloxane oligomer is not too high in molecular weight to be compatible with the base resin.<br>
Specific examples of epoxy-compatible siloxanes are aliphatic pendant epoxy-functional<br>
siloxanes (e.g. GP-611), which are compatible with bisphenol A epoxy resin (e.g. DER 330) and<br>
cycloaliphatic epoxy (e.g. ERL 4221). Diepoxy silicone (e.g. SIB 1115), oligomeric<br>
phenylsilsesquioxane siloxane (e.g. Dow Corning 217 flake), and oligomeric<br>
phenyl/methylsilsesquioxane siloxane (e.g. 3074) are compatible with bisphenol A epoxy (e.g. DER<br>
330). Table A provides descriptive information for the above-mentioned epoxy-compatible<br>
3074 flake is similar to the structures<br>
above, but contains both phenyl and<br>
methyl substitution on the Si atoms,<br>
and again is an oligomeric mixture, not<br>
fully crosslinked.<br>
In addition, when the compatible siloxane/base resin composition is used to make composite<br>
materials having a fibrous or other suitable substrate, the composition will be selected so that <br>
readily wets out the desired substrate. For example, it has been discovered that the presence of<br>
hydroxy groups on the compatible siloxane yields particularly good wetting and mechanical coupling<br>
to fiber-glass reinforcing fabric, which leads to superior mechanical strength in a cured laminate.<br>
Preferably, when aromatic base resins are used in the present invention, the compatible<br>
siloxane will be a polyphenylsiloxane. This is a polysiloxane in which the silicon atom of the<br>
repeating unit(s) is mono- or di-substituted by a phenyl group(s).<br>
Furthermore, the polyphenylsiloxane of the present invention may be epoxy functional.<br>
Preferably, when glass fiber composites are contemplated, the polyphenyl or epoxy-functional<br>
polyphenyl siloxane of the present invention will be hydroxy functional. Most preferably, in these<br>
applications, the siloxane of the present invention is hydroxy functional polyphenylsiloxane.<br>
Also preferred is a hydroxy functional polyphenylsiloxane that is at least 40 mol percent<br>
mono-substituted by phenyl groups or substituted phenyl groups and comprises about 30 to about 70<br>
percent by weight of silicon dioxide and silanol hydroxy groups. Preferably, the silanol hydroxy is<br>
greater than about 2 percent. Particularly preferred is a hydroxy functional polyphenylsiloxane that<br>
comprises about 50 percent by weight of silicon dioxide and silanol hydroxy groups. Highly<br>
preferred is a hydroxy functional polyphenylsiloxane that comprises 100 mol percent of<br>
monophenylsiloxane and about 47 percent by weight of silicon dioxide and about 6 percent by weight<br>
of silanol hydroxy groups.<br>
8"The most highly preferred hydroxy functional polyphenylsiloxane is an oligomeric<br>
phenylsilsesquioxane siloxane, e.g. Flake 217 manufactured by Dow Corning. Flake 217 comprises<br>
an oligomerized 8-membered, alterating Si-O-Si-O atom ring structure, and some 20-membered cage<br>
structures, with phenyl or substituted phenyl groups and hydroxy groups on the silicon atoms <br>
addition to the two oxygen atoms to which each silicon atom is bonded in the rings and cages, as well<br>
as further and less polymerized straight chain siloxane oligomers (see Table A).<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention comprises about 2 to about 50 percent<br>
by weight of the compatible siloxane.<br>
FIRE RETARDANT ADDITIVE<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention preferably comprises an additional<br>
fire retardant additive other than siloxane. The additive may be a phosphorus compound, silica nano<br>
particles, or any other traditional fire retardant additive other than halogenated or antimony<br>
compounds. Preferably the fire retardant composition does not comprise more than trace amounts of<br>
halogenated resin components, halogenated additives or antimony trioxid<br>
Conventional phosphorus-based fire retardant compounds having a boiling point, or<br>
decomposition point, of at least about 180° C are suitable for the present invention. The<br>
decomposition point of at least about 180° C is required for applications where heat curing is used,<br>
since the phosphorus compound must be thoroughly compounded with the monomer, oligomer or<br>
polymer, or any mixture thereof, and must not volatilize or degrade at process temperatures.<br>
The phosphorus compound of the present invention may be selected from such compounds as<br>
red phosphorus; ammonium polyphosphates; oligomeric alkyl or aryl phosphonates (e.g. of dihydric<br>
phenols); triaryl phosphates, such as tricresyl phosphate; alkyl diphenyl phosphates, such as isodecyl<br>
diphenyl phosphate and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate; triphenyl phosphates, such as triphenyl<br>
phosphate; phosphonitrilics; phosphonium bromides; phosphine oxides; reactive organophosphorus<br>
monomers, and various phosphorus-containing diols and polyols. Further details relating to these<br>
materials may be found in the section by E. D. Weil in The Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,<br>
vol. 10, 3rd Edition, pages 396-419 (1980), herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferably, the phosphorus compound is a liquid organo phosphate or phosphonate<br>
compound. Most preferably, the phosphorus compound of the present invention is a liquid<br>
phosphonate ester compound comprising greater than about 20 percent by weight of phosphorus and<br>
greater than about 50 percent by weight of phosphorus oxide.<br>
Alternatively, the fire retardant additive may be silica nano particles. An exemplary silica<br>
nano particle is Nanopox XP 22/0525, manufactured by Hanse Chemie.<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention does not comprise more than trace<br>
amounts of halogenated resin components, which may be residual from the original epoxy synthesis<br>
process.<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention may comprise up to about 40 percent<br>
by weight of an additional fire retardant additive other than siloxane.<br>
OTHER COMPONENTS<br>
The fire retardant composition of the present invention may further comprise a curing agent<br>
such as an amine hardener, e.g. aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines and adducts, adducts with<br>
bisphenol or other hydroxy functional catalysts, amidoamines, imidazoline adducts, an anhydride,<br>
cyanoguanidine, polyamides and mixtures thereof. It is highly preferred that the fire retardant<br>
composition be curable at room temperature with work life/gel time controlled by the choice of<br>
hardener. Heat curing may also be used, at preferably less than 100°C.<br>
Other additives include a mixture of a polyisocyanate having at least two isocyanate groups<br>
with a polyol having at least two hydroxyl groups or a carboxylic acid, and a mixture of acrylates or<br>
methacrylates with an appropriate initiator. Additives having functionalities equal to 2 are highly<br>
preferred mixed with smaller amounts of additives having a functionality that is greater than 2.<br>
Tougheners such as polytetrahydrofuran-diol or -triol and related polyglycol-diols can also be used<br>
with isocyanates to create flexible urethane segments in order to impart toughness in the laminated<br>
products made from the compositions described herein.<br>
Preferably, the fire retardant composition of the present invention will include from about 10<br>
to 40 wt % of a halogen- and antimony-free flame retardant additive and from about 60 to 90 wt % of<br>
one or more monomers, oligomers, or polymers, or any mixtures thereof. More preferably, the fire<br>
retardant composition of the present invention will include from about 10 to about 25 wt %, most<br>
preferably from about 15 to about 25 wt %, of one or more halogen- and antimony-free flame<br>
retardant additives with the remainder being one or more monomers, oligomers, or polymers, or any<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
COMPOSITE METHODS<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a fire retardant composite comprising<br>
the steps of applying the fire retardant composition to a substrate and curing or setting the<br>
composition and substrate to form a composite.<br>
A method of producing a fire retardant laminate comprises the steps of (1) mixing the fire<br>
retardant composition of the present invention with an appropriate amount of a hardener; (2)<br>
assembling multiple plies of a substrate by (a) laying down one ply; (b) applying component (1) onto<br>
the surface of the ply and spreading it over the entire area; (c) placing another ply on top of the<br>
preceding ply; (d) repeating steps (a)-(c) until all plies have been laid down; and (3) curing the multiply<br>
laminate.<br>
A second method of producing a fire retardant laminate comprises the steps of (1) mixing the<br>
fire retardant composition of the present invention with an appropriate amount of a hardener; (2)<br>
assembling multiple plies of a substrate into a stack; (b) applying component (1) to the stack; (c)<br>
allowing component (1) to spread throughout the stack using vacuum and/or autoclave pressure; and<br>
(3) curing the multi-ply laminate.<br>
Other fabric/resin infusion methods such as vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding<br>
(VARTM) can be used with the fire retardant composition of the present invention. In the VARTM<br>
process, the fire retardant composition of the present invention is mixed with an appropriate amount<br>
of a hardener. A stack of dry fibreglass or other fabric is placed in a mold fitted with a flexible,<br>
vacuum tight top, a vacuum valve on one end, and a liquid resin reservoir valve on the other. The<br>
mold is evacuated prior to opening the resin valve. After the resin valve is opened and the resin is<br>
allowed to flow into the evacuated fiber stack-filled cavity, vacuum pumping is continued to 'assist<br>
transfer of the liquid resin' through the evacuated fiber stack. Pumping is continued for a time after<br>
closing the resin valve to compact the fiber/resin structure to a maximum, void-free fiber content.<br>
The multi-ply laminate is thereafter cured.<br>
The substrate in the foregoing methods, composites and laminates may be any substrate<br>
known in the art of composite materials. For example, the substrate may be fiberglass, carbon fibers,<br>
or carbon nanotubes. The method of laminating is usually carried out with the assistance of vacuum,<br>
although with low enough viscosity liquids, gravity and 'surface-tension'-only assisted lamination<br>
may be possible. The best viscosity ranges for use in laminating and fiber wetting systems (low<br>
surface energy liquid spreading on higher surface energy fibers) is 500-10,000 cps, most preferably<br>
1000-5000 cps.<br>
The present invention is directed to fire retardant compositions able to provide selfextinguishing<br>
properties for applications requiring low viscosity as laminating resins, adhesives,<br>
sealants, coatings, printed wiring boards, prepregs, composites with combustible or non combustible<br>
fibers such as glass fibers, Aluminium borate whiskers, granite fibers etc, and other fibers such as<br>
textile and carbon fibers. These compositions comprise a base resin and a compatible siloxane and,<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Table 1 lists the components of Compositions 1-6. The numbers in Table 1 refer to the<br>
weight percent of each component based on the total weight of the fire retardant composition, which<br>
is cured with an amine hardener at ratios in the range of 100 parts of the fire retardant composition to<br>
13-16 parts of the amine hardener. Compositions 3, 4 and 6 were prepared by first heating bisphenol<br>
A epoxy to about 95°C (203°F) while stirring. While high shear mixing, 217 flake was added slowly.<br>
Bisphenol A epoxy and 217 flake were mixed while heating until the 217 flake was completely<br>
dissolved, fonning a liquid intermediate. The intermediate and all other components were then mixed<br>
at room temperature, or up to about 150°F, until a uniform mixture was obtained. All of the starting<br>
components of compositions 1, 2 and 5 were liquids and were simply mixed at ambient temperature,<br>
or up to about 150°F, until a uniform mixture was obtained.<br>
Composition 1 (the control) contains pentabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE), a brominated flame<br>
retardant. It has the following structure:<br>
COMPOSITIONS 3, 4 AND 6<br>
Compositions 3, 4 and 6, shown above, comprise bisphenol A and bisphenol F epoxies and a<br>
siloxane having 100 mol percent of a monophenylsiloxane having about 47 percent by weight of<br>
silicon dioxide groups and 6 percent by weight of silanol hydroxy groups.<br>
COMPOSITION 4<br>
Composition 4 is a low viscosity epoxy laminating resin. It comprises a phosphonate ester<br>
compound and an epoxy-compatible, fiberglass- and filler-wetting polyphenylsiloxane in order to<br>
achieve high compressive strength and flame retarding properties in a room-temperature curing,<br>
laminating resin blend. Composition 4 does not contain typical flame retardant additives, such as a<br>
brominated and/or chlorinated compound or antimony trioxide.<br>
Table 2 lists the components of Composition 4 and some descriptive information regarding<br>
each component. The numbers in Table 2 refer to the weight percent of each component based on the<br>
total weight of the fire retardant composition. Table 3 provides further descriptive information for<br>
COMPOSITION 6<br>
Composition 6 comprises a nano-silica dispersion in epoxy and an epoxy-compatible,<br>
fiberglass- and filler-wetting polyphenylsiloxane in order to achieve high compressive strength and<br>
flame retarding properties in a room-temperature curing, laminating epoxy resin blend. Composition<br>
6 does not contain typical flame retardant additives, such as a brominated and/or chlorinated<br>
compound or antimony trioxide. Additionally, composition 6 does not contain phosphorous<br>
compounds and is therefore the most environmentally 'green' technology.<br>
Table 4 lists the components of Composition 6 and some descriptive information regarding<br>
each component. The numbers in Table 4 refer to the weight percent of each component based on the<br>
total weight of the fire retardant composition. Table 5 provides further descriptive information for<br>
the components of Composition 6.<br>

Laminate Preparation<br>
The glass cloth used had the following properties: style 1581 or 7781, 8-shaft satin weave,<br>
57/54 warp/filling, a thickness of 0.008-0.012 for style 1581 or 0.008-0.011 for style 7781, and a<br>
Volan coating.<br>
To determine the compressive strength, flammability and lap shear strength of a cured<br>
laminate made from curing compositions 1-6 with an amine hardener, the amine hardener was added<br>
to the compositions in a resin/hardener ratio of 100/13-15. Specifically, the resin/hardener ratio for<br>
compositions 1, 2 and 6 was 100/15, 100/13 for compositions 3 and 5 and 100/14 for composition 4.<br>
Compressive strength test<br>
Compositions 1 -6 were each used individually to produce laminates that were subsequently<br>
tested for compressive strength.<br>
Twelve plies of glass cloth were cut to the appropriate dimensions. Compositions 1-6 were<br>
mixed with Epocast Hardener 9816 (supplied by Huntsman Advanced Materials Americas Inc.) in the<br>
resin/hardener ratios listed above. A 12-ply laminate was assembled by laying down one ply at a<br>
time, applying one of the compositions to the surface of the glass cloth, and then spreading the<br>
composition over the entire area. The next ply of glass cloth was placed on top of the first ply and<br>
the process above repeated until all 12 plies had been laid down. Another set of laminates was made<br>
using compositions 1-6 with Epocast Hardener 946 according to the protocol described above. The<br>
cured data reported in Table 7 is an average from the two laminate sets.<br>
Initial curing was done in a vacuum bag in order to remove air and excess resin using 20<br>
inches of vacuum bag pressure. Cure time in the vacuum bag was 16 to 24 hours. The laminate was<br>
removed from the vacuum bag and placed in a 25°C incubator for 7 days to complete the cure. The<br>
fiber content was verified at 67±3% by weight prior to testing.<br>
The laminate was tested according to the Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties<br>
for Rigid Plastics (ASTM D695).<br>
Flammability test<br>
Compositions 1-6 were each used individually to produce a laminate that was subsequently<br>
tested for flammability.<br>
Two plies of glass cloth were cut to the appropriate dimensions. Compositions 1-6 were<br>
mixed with Epocast Hardener 9816 in the resin/hardener ratios listed above. The 2-ply laminate was<br>
assembled by laying down one ply, applying one of the compositions to the surface of the ply,<br>
spreading the composition over the entire area, and placing the second ply on top. Another set of<br>
laminates was made using compositions 1-6 with Epocast Hardener 946 according to the protocol<br>
described above. The cured data reported in Table 7 is an average from the two laminate sets.<br>
Initial curing was done in a vacuum bag in order to remove air and excess resin using 20<br>
inches of vacuum bag pressure. Cure time in the vacuum bag was 16 to 24 hours. The laminate was<br>
removed from the vacuum bag and placed in a 25°C incubator for 7 days to complete the cure. The<br>
fiber content was verified at 67±3% by weight prior to testing.<br>
A determination of flammability properties for the 2-ply laminates was made by the 60-<br>
Second Vertical Ignition Test specified by the Boeing Company in BSS7230, which references CFR<br>
25.853.<br>
Lap Shear Strength<br>
Compositions 1, 2, 4 and 6 were used to prepare laminates that were subsequently tested for<br>
lap shear strength.<br>
Compositions 1, 2, 4 and 6 were mixed with Epocast Hardener 9816 in the resin/hardener<br>
ratios listed above. Six-ply laminates were assembled by laying down one ply at a time, applying one<br>
of the compositions to the surface of the ply, and then spreading the composition over the entire area.<br>
The next ply of glass cloth was placed on top of the first ply and the process above repeated until all<br>
6 plies had been laid down. This process of producing a laminate was repeated using each<br>
composition 1, 2, 4 and 6.<br>
Initial curing was done in a vacuum bag in order to remove air and excess resin using 20<br>
inches of vacuum bag pressure. Cure time in the vacuum bag was 16 to 24 hours. The laminate was<br>
removed from the vacuum bag and placed in a 25°C incubator for 7 days to complete the cure. The<br>
fiber content was verified at 67±3% by weight prior to testing.<br>
To determine lap shear strength, the cured 6-ply laminate was bonded to another cured 6-ply<br>
laminate at room temperature, using as the bonding adhesive the same laminating resin that was used<br>
to prepare the laminates from compositions 1, 2, 4 and 6. The specimens were allowed to cure at<br>
room temperature and were measured for tensile shear strength, according to ASTM D1002, after<br>
temperature/humidity conditioning. Cohesive failure within the bonding layer or laminate is desired<br>
to indicate that the adhesive bond strength is higher than the cohesive strength of the cured<br>
laminating resin.<br>
TEST RESULTS<br>
Table 6 shows the active components of Compositions 1-6. Table 7 shows the test results for<br>
Compositions 1-6. Unexpectedly superior test results include an uncured viscosity of less than 5000<br>
cps, a laminate-compressive strength of greater than 45,000 psi following curing, and all cured<br>
compositions were transparent. Other desirable test results include certain flame properties such as<br>
self-extinction, a burn length of less than 4 inches, no drip, and low smoke emission.<br>
As noted above, Composition 1 comprises pentabromodiphenylether as the flame retardant.<br>
It does not comprise phosphonate or siloxane components. Composition 2 comprises a phosphonate<br>
ester as the flame retardant. It does not comprise any halogenated flame retardant additives or<br>
siloxanes. Composition 3 comprises a siloxane as the flame retardant. It does not comprise a<br>
phosphonate ester or halogenated flame retardant additives. Composition 4 comprises both a<br>
phosphonate ester and a siloxane. It does not comprise a halogenated flame retardant additive.<br>
