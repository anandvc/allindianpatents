ROTATING VALVE ASSEMBLY<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to Nsw Zealand Provisional Patent Application.<br>
Serial No. 526158, filedMay 29,2003, entitled "Rotating Scaling Mechanism" and<br>
U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 6S,	__„""   ""October 31,2003,<br>
entitled "Valve Assembly for Surgical Actors Device", the disclosures of each arc<br>
herein incorporated "by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVKNTIOfr<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
ThesubjectinventLon relates genenilly to the field of sealing mechanisms, and<br>
more particularly to, a compact valve assembly for use in a variety of applications,<br>
which, includes a valve member that is readily actuated between, the open and lie<br>
closed position by a camming mechanism.<br>
2.	Background of the Related Art<br>
Ball valves are well inown to those skilled in fee art and are commonly used<br>
mavari^ofapplicatibnsaiidindustri,es. Typically, in applications mat concern<br>
controlling the flow of a fluid, an apertured ball valve is selected. In an apertiired ball<br>
valve, a generally spherical valve member that has a flow aperture or passage formed<br>
therethrough is positioned for rotational movement wiHun a valve housing. The valve<br>
operation ox functionis broken down, into irwo separate stages. First, the ball moves<br>
between an open and a closed position by rotating through. 90 degrees, such that the.<br>
aperture or fiow passage moves from an orientation coaxial with the flow .direction,<br>
te. when the valve is open, to apoaitionv^hereby the ball aperture is normal or<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2004/106782	PCT/US2004/017177<br>
perpendicular to "the flow direction. Second, the valve seals in. the dosed position to<br>
prevent flowthrou^L the aperture across the "ball valve. Therefore, the on -off control<br>
of flow through the valve is achieved by relating the ball through 90 degrees within,<br>
the valve housing.<br>
In-prior art ball valves; the rotation, of the ball (Le., valve member) is typically<br>
effectuated by an actuator mechanism that protrudes from the valve housing and is<br>
configirred to rotate about m axis pcipendi^^	Suciha<br>
valve is disclosed in. U.S. PatentNo- 6,695,285 to Hotton et aL<br>
Several disadvantages are associated with this type of ball valve. For<br>
example, the extension of an actuator feom the sLdewall of the valve is cumbersome<br>
and not desirable for applications where space limitatioris and physical access to the<br>
actuator are a concern. Still further, the ac'uaior in these valves mnstbe rotated or<br>
turned through at least 90 degrees in order for the valve to move between, the folly<br>
open and fully closed positions-<br>
Tnerefore, it would be beneficial therefore, to provide a valve/seal mechanism<br>
thatls compact, reliable and readily actuated between the open and closed position<br>
and actuated with a tn^i™^ amount of rotational movement<br>
STBJMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tne subject application is directed to a valve/seal assembly that is adapted for.<br>
use in a variety of applications, such, as for example, medical, consumer beverage,<br>
pharmaceutical containers, automobile, hcfusehold appliance and marine, The<br>
disclosed valve includeSj inter alia, a valve housing liaving aniippcr body portion and<br>
 a. lower body portion and a generally spherical valve member. Ite upper and lower<br>
body portions of the housing define an internal chamber for accommodating the Yalve<br>

WO 2004/106782	PCT/US2004/017177<br>
member and a central axis for the valve. Tiic housing also has azially aligned inlet<br>
and outlet ports formed in the upper and lower body portions, respectively.<br>
The generally spherical vah^ member is seated within the internal chamber of<br>
the valve housing and has an. axM bore extiading therethron^L Tne valve member is<br>
mounted for movement between an open position; wherein the axial bore of the valve<br>
member is axiadly aligaed with the inlet ami outlet ports of-the valve housing, and a.<br>
closed position; whercii the anal bore of tiie valve member is out of alignment writi<br>
the inlet and outlet ports of the valve housing. Preferably, the valve member moves<br>
between me open position and the closed position when the upper body po rtion of the<br>
housing is rotated about the central axis between about 57 degrees and about 77<br>
degrees with respect to the lower body portion. It is presently envisioned that the<br>
valve member is mounted for axial rotation within, the interior chsrober about an axis<br>
extending perpendicular to the central axis; defined by fee upper and lower body<br>
portion of the valve housing.<br>
Preferably, the valve member includes a sealing surface adapted for sealing<br>
engagement with, a valve seat formed in the housing when the val ve is in the closed<br>
position. In applications where a pressure is applied to the fluid or air metered by the<br>
valve, the scaling surface of the valve member is adapted to include an n-ntinlar recess<br>
having an o-ring disposed therein.<br>
The valve assembly further includes a mechanism that is operatively<br>
associated with the valve housing and the valve member for moving the valve<br>
member between the open position and QLB closed position wnen the upper body<br>
portion of the housing is rotated about the; central axis with respect to the lower body<br>
portion. In a preferred embodiment, lie mechanism for actuating the valve assembly<br>

Valve assembly 500 is similar m structure and function to valve assembly 100.<br>
However, unlike valve assembly 100, valve assembly 500 includes actuator arms<br>
528a through 528d that facilitate the relative rotation of the upps: body portion 520 of<br>
the valve assembly 500 with respect to tie "lower body portion. 530 thereby moving<br>

Referdng now to Fig. 13, ihere is illustrated showerhead -whack includes a<br>
valve assembly constructed in accordance with, an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention and designated by referenc e numeral 700. Again, valve assembly<br>
700 is similar in structure and operation to ttie previously disclosed valves, but unlike<br>
the prior valves, valve assembly 700 has a plurality of flow passages 753 formed m<br>
the valve member 750.<br>
The flow passages 753 extend, along an axis that is perpendicular to the axial<br>
bore 752 such, thai when, the valve member is m the closed position, fluid traverses the<br>
valve through the plurality of flow passages 753. Hence when me valve assembly<br>
700 is in the open position, a single jet of water is emitted from the showerhead<br>
assembly and when it is in me closed position, water streams from me flow passages<br>
753. O-ring seals 755a, 755b and 757a, 757b ace provided aibotii ends of me axial<br>

Referring now to Fig. 14 which illustrates a valve assembly (designated by<br>
reference numeral 800) constructed in accordance with the present invention<br>
positioned within the inlet 862 of fuel tank, The use of valve assembly 800 in this<br>
application allows for the elimination of a removable gas cap and only requires an<br>
approximately 67 degrees rotation of drive ring 890 to open the valve. The axial bore<br>
852 of the valve member would be adapted for receiving a standard foci pump nozzle<br>

Minimally invasive surgical procedures are commonly performed by passing<br>
surgical instruments through a narrow tubs or cannula inserted through a small<br>
entrance incisicn formed in a patient's bocly using a trocar or obturator. For example,<br>
laparoscopic surgical procedures are performed within the abdannnal cavity through<br>
small incision^ farmed in the abdominal wall. During a laparoscopio procedure,<br>
insufflating gases are introduced into the; abdominal cavity to raise the abdominal wall<br>
or peritoneum away from the vital organs within the abdominal cavity, thereby<br>
providing an adequate region in "which to operate.<br>
