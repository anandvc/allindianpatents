				<td>AN OBJECT OF VALUE WITH A SECURITY ELEMENT, AND A<br>
SECURITY ELEMENT THEREFOR<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a security element for protecting objects of value,<br>
which has a liquid-crystalline material. Furthermore, the invention relates to an object<br>
of value, a transfer material and method for producing such security elements and<br>
objects of value as well as a method for checking such a security element or object of<br>
value.<br>
[0002] An object of value within the terms of the invention can be any object to be<br>
protected, such as for example trademarked products or documents of value. Objects<br>
of value within the terms of the present invention are, in particular, security documents<br>
such as bank notes, but also share certificates, deeds, stamps, checks, check cards,<br>
credit cards, identity documents, passports, admission tickets, tickets, flight tickets and<br>
the like as well as labels, seals, packagings, security paper or other elements for the<br>
product protection. The simplifying term ,,object of value or ,,security element"<br>
therefore in the following always includes documents of the mentioned type.<br>
[0003] From DE 199 41 295 Ala security element with liquid-crystalline material<br>
is known, which has thermochromic properties. Upon heating the thermochromic<br>
liquid-crystalline material changes its color or becomes transparent, so that the<br>
security element can be recognized as such by a viewer.<br>
[0004] One problem with such security elements with liquid-crystalline<br>
thermochromic material is, that for obtaining the thermochromic effect a certain<br>
difference in temperature is required. But, however, not in every situation it is possible<br>
to produce a sufficiently great difference in temperature, which is why the expected<br>
color change does not occur.<br>
[0005] It is therefore the problem of the present invention to create an object of<br>
value, a transfer element and a security element, the check of which can be effected<br>
independently of temperature and can be easily carried out both visually and by<br>
machine. In addition, the manufacturing of the object of value, transfer element and<br>
security element shall be especially simple, and they shall guarantee a high degree of<br>
protection from forgery.<br>
[0006] It is further the problem of the invention to provide methods for producing<br>
such a security element and object of value as well as a method for checking the<br>
security element or object of value.<br>
[0007] These problems are solved by the features of the independent claims.<br>
Developments are subject of the subclaims.<br>
[0008] According to the invention the security element has at least one liquid-<br>
crystalline material, the material effecting a linear polarization of light.<br>
[0009] By checking whether the light diffusely reflected and/ or transmitted by the<br>
security element is polarized, the authenticity of the security element is checked with<br>
a high degree of reliability and independently of the surrounding temperature or of<br>
differences in temperature to be produced. The improvement of the forgery-proofness<br>
in particular results from the use of polarizing liquid-crystalline materials, since such "<br>
materials either are elaborately to produce or cannot readily be commercially obtained,*<br>
but can be adjusted, in contrast to normal, to thick and rigid polarization foils, to the<br>
objects to be protected and be processed with methods, which are similar to those as<br>
already used with security prints.<br>
[0010] Preferably, lyotropic liquid crystals are used as a liquid-crystalline material.<br>
Here a solution containing lyotropic liquid crystals is applied onto at least one surface<br>
of the security element, while shearing forces are exerted. Preferably, a layer with a<br>
thickness of some microns is applied, which after the evaporation of the solvent leads<br>
to a remaining layer thickness of 100 to 1000 nanometer. Conventional polarization<br>
foils have thicknesses of at least 0.1 millimeter.<br>
[0011] For the liquid-crystalline materials according to the invention within the<br>
framework of the invention numerous variation possibilities are expedient. The liquid-<br>
crystalline material can be provided all-over or preferably only in certain areas, in<br>
particular in the form of characters or patterns.<br>
[0012] The security element can either be produced directly on the object of value or<br>
prepared on a separate substrate. With respect to the material used, the object of value<br>
or the separate substrate, on which the security element is located, is in no way<br>
restricted. But preferably it is paper or plastic, also in the form of foils. In the case of a<br>
separate substrate the security element can be formed, for example, as a self-supporting<br>
label, preferably on a plastic substrate. In particular, the security element has the form<br>
of a security thread, especially preferred a window thread. The latter allows an<br>
especially striking visual testing by comparing areas with polarized light to such with<br>
unpolarized light.<br>
[0013] In some cases it may be difficult to provide the respective layer sequence<br>
directly on the object of value, therefore, alternatively, it may be expedient, to prepare<br>
the layer structure of the security element at least partially on a transfer material.<br>
[0014] If the entire layer sequence of the security element is prepared on a transfer<br>
material, attention will have to be paid to the fact that the layer structure shown in the<br>
respective Figures has to be prepared in the reverse order on the carrier tape of the<br>
transfer material. The layer structure of the security element can be prepared in an .<br>
endless form on the carrier tape. The fastening as a security element on an object of<br>
value to be protected is effected with the aid of an adhesive layer, which either is<br>
applied onto the object of value or onto the topmost layer of the transfer material.<br>
Preferably, for this a hot-melt adhesive is used. In order to determine the outline form<br>
of the security element, there either can be provided an adhesive layer only in the areas<br>
to be transferred, or the adhesive, such as for example a hot-melt adhesive, is activated<br>
only in the areas to be transferred. After the transfer the carrier tape of the transfer<br>
material is stripped off and merely the shown layer structure of the security element<br>
remains on the object of value to be secured.<br>
[0015] The object of value, onto which the security element is applied, can be, for<br>
example, a security paper, a security document, but also product packagings. Other<br>
objects of value, for which a protection in terms of security is required, of course can<br>
also be provided with the security element according to the invention.<br>
[0016] Preferably, the security element is disposed as a whole on the surface of the<br>
object to be secured. When the security element is completely disposed on the surface<br>
of the object, it can be designed to have a substantially larger surface, so that the<br>
optical effect of the liquid-crystalline material due to the larger area is much more<br>
striking.<br>
[0017] Further advantages and embodiments of the invention are explained in more<br>
detail with reference to the Figures. The proportions (in particular layer thicknesses)<br>
shown in the Figures do not necessarily correspond to the dimensions present in reality<br>
and primarily serve for the improvement of clarity.<br>
[0018] For clarity's sake the invention is explained in more detail only with<br>
reference to a bank note. But it is obvious, that the invention can be used without any<br>
problems for the above-mentioned objects of value.<br>
[0019] Figure 1 shows a bank note with a security element according to the<br>
invention,<br>
[0020] Figures 2,3 show various embodiments of the security element<br>
according to Figure 1 in cross section,<br>
[0021] Figure 4 shows an embodiment of the security element according to<br>
Figure 1 in top view,<br>
[0022] Figures 5,6 show various embodiments of the security element<br>
according to Figure 4 in cross section,<br>
[0023] Figure 7 , shows an embodiment of a bank note with a security<br>
element according to the invention, and<br>
[0024] Figures 8,9,10 show apparatuses for checking bank notes with security<br>
element according to the invention.<br>
[0025] Figure 1 shows a bank note 1 made of paper or plastic, which is provided<br>
with a security element 2 in the form of a strip extending over the entire width of the<br>
bank note 1. The bank note 1 of course can have further security features, such as<br>
watermark, steel gravure print, security thread, luminescent and/ or magnetic prints<br>
etc.<br>
[0026] The security element 2 has a liquid-crystalline layer. The liquid-crystalline<br>
layer of the security element 2 has at least one liquid-crystalline material, which<br>
effects a linear polarization of light. The security element 2 is completely disposed<br>
on the surface of the bank note 1, so that the light-polarizing effect of the liquid-<br>
crystalline layer preferably applied in the form of patterns and/ or characters is very<br>
well recognizable. The patterns and/ or characters can effect linear polarizations,<br>
which have different orientation, i.e. the polarization direction of the security<br>
element 2 is locally different. By checking whether and in which direction light<br>
diffusely reflected and/or transmitted by the security element 2 is polarized, the<br>
authenticity of the security element 2 can be checked with a high degree of<br>
reliability.<br>
[0027] Preferably, lyotropic liquid crystals are used as a liquid-crystalline material.<br>
Lyotropic liquid crystals are liquid crystals formed by organic material, which have<br>
liquid-crystalline properties both in a for example aqueous solution and after the<br>
removal of the solvent. Advantageously, a solution containing lyotropic liquid<br>
crystals is applied onto at least one surface of the security element, while shearing<br>
forces are exerted. Preferably, a layer thickness of some micron is applied, which,<br>
after the evaporation of the solvent, leads to remaining layer thicknesses of 100 to<br>
1000 nanometer. The layer remaining after the evaporation of the solvent has plies of<br>
the organic material ordered in supramolecular complexes, for example polymers.<br>
The surfaces of the molecules as well as their dipole moments of the optical<br>
transmission are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the macroscopic orientation of<br>
the remaining layer. The polarization direction of the remaining layer therefore<br>
corresponds to the direction of the shearing force applied during the application of<br>
the solution containing the lyotropic liquid crystals.<br>
[0028] Such lyotropic liquid crystals partly have polarization spectra which do not<br>
have a polarization and for this reason even with a, in relation to the polarization<br>
direction of the liquid crystals, crossed analyzer they transmit a certain spectral<br>
portion, so that light, with which the security element 2 is irradiated, after the<br>
transmission through the layer of the lyotropic liquid crystals, beside a linear<br>
polarization has a certain color, e.g. red, violet or blue. Further colors are possible,<br>
e.g. even in the not visible area of light. In particular, a polarization of infrared or<br>
ultraviolet light can also be achieved. The polarization or non-polarization of certain<br>
wavelength ranges (colors) thus can be effected selectively. By analyzing both the<br>
polarization and the residual color with crossed polarizers an especially reliable<br>
determination of the security element is possible.<br>
[0029] Detailed specifications for producing and applying the lyotropic liquid<br>
crystals can be inferred from US 5,739,296, US 6,049,428 and WO 02/087782 Al.<br>
[0030] The described color effect on the light, which is transmitted through the<br>
security element 2, can be perceived particularly well, when for viewing as an<br>
analyzer a linear polarizer is used, the polarization direction of which in relation to the<br>
polarization direction of the liquid-crystalline layer of the security element 2 is turned<br>
by 90 degrees. The same effect can be achieved, when already the light used for the<br>
illumination of the security element 2 is linearly polarized with the help of a linear<br>
polarizer, the polarization direction of which is turned by 90 degrees in relation to the<br>
polarization direction of the liquid-crystalline layer of the security element 2. The<br>
above-described polarizers used for the proving, advantageously can also be produced<br>
with the lyotropic liquid crystals used for the security element 2.<br>
[0031] As the described color effect is based on the absorption of the light, which<br>
is linearly polarized in a certain spectral region and coming from the security element,<br>
in the analyzer, when embedding the security element in a scattering substrate such as<br>
bank note paper or disposing it on the back of the substrate, the polarization is<br>
cancelled and thus the color effect. By partially embedding the security element in the<br>
substrate, as with a so-called window security thread, with a parallel orientation of the<br>
polarization direction of the analyzer the difference in brightness and color between<br>
the embedded areas and the bare areas of the security element is only small, and with<br>
an orientation turned by 90 degrees the difference is very striking.<br>
[0032] Beside the described liquid-crystalline layer the security element 2 can have<br>
further layers, which alone or in combination with other layers of the security<br>
element 2 produce further striking optical effects.<br>
[0033] Some preferred embodiments are explained in more detail with reference to<br>
the Figures 2 and 3, which show the bank note 1 in cross section along the dash-<br>
dotted line A - A, so as to illustrate the layer structure of the security element 2.<br>
[0034] According to Figure 2 the paper substrate or plastic substrate 3 of the bank<br>
note 1, which has a white or bright inherent color, is provided with a lyotropic liquid-<br>
crystalline layer 4 in the form of characters or patterns. In order to improve the<br>
applying of the lyotropic liquid-crystalline layer 4, in particular for a paper substrate<br>
3 it can be provided, that a so-called primer layer is applied onto the paper substrate<br>
3. The primer layer can be, for example, a colorless plastic layer or an ink layer, the<br>
surface of which has an only low roughness.<br>
[0035] With certain embodiments, e.g. security elements which when used are<br>
subject to a heavy mechanical or chemical load, it is expedient to cover the liquid-<br>
crystalline materials with a protection layer 5. The protection layer 5 can be a foil<br>
laminated over the security element 2 or a protective lacquer layer. The protective<br>
lacquer layer can be applied all-over or in partial areas. For this purpose e.g. UV<br>
lacquers, hybrid lacquers, oil-based lacquers or dispersion lacquers of the one- or<br>
two-component type can be used. The protective lacquer layer preferably is printed,<br>
e.g. by flexographic printing or offset printing.<br>
[0036] Likewise, the security element 2 can be a separate element, which is<br>
adapted to be applied onto the bank note. The separate security element 2 can have a<br>
structure, which corresponds to the structure described with reference to Figure 2. In<br>
this case the substrate 3, e.g. a transparent plastic foil, of the security element 2 is<br>
adhesively bonded to the bank note 1. For this purpose the plastic forming the<br>
substrate 3 can be a hot-melt adhesive.<br>
[0037] In Figure 3 a variant of the separate security element 2 is shown. Onto a<br>
substrate 3, e.g. a transparent plastic foil, a lyotropic liquid-crystalline layer 4 is<br>
applied. Onto the liquid-crystalline layer 4 then an adhesive layer 6 is applied, with<br>
the help of which the security element 2 is fastened to the bank note 1. The adhesive<br>
used for this purpose can be a hot-melt adhesive. Instead of onto the security element<br>
2 the adhesive can also be applied onto the bank note 1 in order to fasten the security<br>
element 2 to the bank note 1.<br>
[0038] If the foil 3 consists of birefringent material (e.g. expanded polymer foil)<br>
with the right orientation and predetermined phase shift (e.g. quarter-wave or half-<br>
wave plate), the compound according to Figure 2 or 3 depending on the layer<br>
sequence acts as a linear- or as a circular- (general elliptic) polarizer for transmitted<br>
light. The results (e.g. when used as a lookthrough register) are different<br>
polarizations and testing possibilities in the two possible transmission or viewing<br>
directions.<br>
[0039] The Figures 4 to 6 show further preferred embodiments, wherein Figure 4<br>
shows a security element 2 in plan view, whereas the Figures 5 and 6 show the<br>
security element in cross section along the dash-dotted line A - A, so as to illustrate<br>
the layer structure of the security element 2.<br>
[0040] Figure 4 shows a security element 2 with pieces of information 8. These<br>
pieces of information can be present, for example, in the form of plain text, e.g.<br>
alphanumeric characters.<br>
[0041] From Figure 5 is apparent, that the security element 2 comprises a substrate<br>
3, e.g. a transparent plastic foil, of a metal layer 7, which can be e.g. sputtered,<br>
vapor-deposited, adhesively bonded etc. onto the substrate 3 and does not have any<br>
metal in the areas containing the pieces of information 8, as well as of a lyotropic<br>
liquid-crystalline layer 4 applied onto the metal layer. The gaps formed in the metal<br>
layer 7 by the pieces of information 8 can be filled in with the help of a filling<br>
material, e.g. transparent plastic material.<br>
[0042] Figure 6 shows a variant of the security element 2 represented in Figure 5,<br>
wherein on the substrate 3 at first the lyotropic liquid-crystalline layer 4 is applied.<br>
Thereon the metal layer 7 is disposed.<br>
[0043] The embodiments of the security element 2 described in the Figures 5 and 6<br>
can have further components, e.g. the above-described protection layer, adhesive<br>
layer etc. Likewise, it is possible to produce the security element 2 directly on a bank<br>
note 1, then the substrate of the bank note 1 forms the substrate of the security<br>
element.<br>
[0044] In a security element 2 according to Figure 5 the above-described optical<br>
effects be viewed on transmission only in the area of the pieces of information 8. In a<br>
security element according to Figure 6 the described optical effects can be viewed<br>
both on transmission as well a on diffuse reflection only in the area of the pieces of<br>
information 8.<br>
[0045] A further embodiment of a bank note 1 with security element 2 is shown in<br>
Figure 7. The security element 2 at least partially is embedded in the substrate of the<br>
bank note 1, so that the security element 2, which e.g. is a security thread, is visible<br>
only in certain areas 2a, so-called ,,windows". The above-described optical effects<br>
then are only visible in the areas 2a.<br>
[0046] The security element can also be designed as a transfer material, with a<br>
structure such as described with reference to the Figures 1 to 6. In this case the layti<br>
structure is applied in reverse order onto a transfer material. The security element is<br>
applied onto the bank note with the help of the transfer material and the transfer<br>
material thereafter is entirely or partially removed.<br>
[0047] As already mentioned, the security element can have further layers or<br>
components, the additional layers can be used separately or in combination, the<br>
layers can cover the entire security element or only parts thereof.<br>
[0048] For example, underneath the polarizing liquid-crystalline layer can be<br>
disposed a fluorescent layer or fluorescent areas. Radiated fluorescent light then is<br>
linearly polarized.<br>
[0049] Likewise, interference layers can be disposed above or underneath the<br>
polarizing liquid-crystalline layer.<br>
[0050] Furthermore, it is possible to prpduce interference pigments. For this purpose<br>
onto one side or on both sides of such interference layers are applied liquid-crystalline<br>
layers. The layer compound formed in such a way is broken into pigments, which are<br>
polarizing. The polarizing interference pigments formed in such a way can be used,<br>
also in a mixture with not polarizing interference pigments, for producing security<br>
elements and can be for example printed onto these. These then show, beside the<br>
directional dependence of the color, also a polarization of the backscattered light.<br>
[0051] Furthermore, the security element can have further polarizing layers, as well<br>
as diffraction structures which for example can form holograms.<br>
[0052] Likewise, the security element can have a phase-shifting layer, the proving of<br>
which can be effected with the help of a phase plate.<br>
[0053] The security element can also be formed as a so-called planchet, which<br>
preferably is incorporated in the surface of the bank note substrate, and on one side or<br>
on both sides is provided with polarizing layers.<br>
[0054] According to the invention it can also be provided to attach at least one<br>
lyotropic liquid-crystalline layer onto a lookthrough register. Lookthrough register<br>
within the terms of the invention means an area in a bank note that is transparent. The<br>
lookthrough register can be formed, for example, by the substrate of the bank note itself,<br>
if it is made of plastic. But it is also possible to incorporate a respectively designed<br>
lookthrough register, e.g. a plastic foil, in the paper substrate of a bank note. Here it<br>
is especially advantageous, when on both surfaces of the lookthrough register a<br>
lyotropic liquid-crystalline layer is applied, these being disposed such that their<br>
polarizations are turned by 90 degrees. Thereby the above-described color effect is<br>
maximized.<br>
[0055] In a different embodiment the foil of the lookthrough register can be<br>
birefringent. Then, depending on whether the irradiation is effected from the layer<br>
side or from the foil side, the above-described direction-dependent linear or circular<br>
polarization of the transmitted light is the result.<br>
[0056] The lookthrough register can also have diffraction structures, which e.g.<br>
form a semitransparent hologram.<br>
[0057] As described above the security element 2 can be produced directly on the<br>
bank note 1 or provided as a separate security element 2 and fastened to the bank<br>
note 1. But it can also be provided to provide a separate security element 2, the<br>
structure of which is not completed until the security element 2 has been fastened to<br>
the bank note 1, e.g. is provided with a polarizing layer or a protection layer.<br>
[0058] Figures 8 to 10 show apparatuses for the check of bank notes having<br>
security element according to the invention.<br>
[0059] Figure 8 shows an arrangement consisting of a light source 10, a detector<br>
11 and a bank note 1 having a security element 2, for checking the bank note 1 with<br>
the help of light diffusely reflected by the bank note 1. The light of the light source<br>
10 passes through the linearly polarizing layer of the security element 2 and thereby<br>
is linearly polarized. This light is scattered by the substrate of the bank note 1 and in<br>
this way depolarized. The scattered light passes through the linearly polarizing layer<br>
of the security element and again is linearly polarized. With the help of the detector<br>
11 the presence of the security element 2 can be proven, if the detected light is<br>
linearly polarized. If the security element 2 has regions of different polarization, then<br>
perceivable light/dark contrasts will be the result. Instead of or additionally to the<br>
polarization, the above-described color effect of the light coming from the security<br>
element 2, which is determined by the type of the lyotropic liquid crystal used, can<br>
be evaluated by the detector 11. If in front of the light source 10 and/or in front of the<br>
detector 11 is placed a polarizer 12 or 12', which has a linear polarization, which in<br>
relation to the linear polarization of the security element 2 is turned by 90 degrees,<br>
the color effect or the light/dark contrast for the light coming from the security<br>
element 2 will become more intensive. Ideally, the polarizers 12 or 12' have a<br>
linearly polarizing layer, which consists of the same lyotropic liquid crystal as the<br>
polarizing layer of the security element 2.<br>
[0060] Figure 9a shows an arrangement consisting of a light source 10, a detector<br>
11 and a bank note 1 having a security element 2, for checking the bank note 1 with<br>
the help of light transmitted through the bank note 1. The light of the light source 10<br>
passes through the substrate of the bank note 1 and the linearly polarizing layer of<br>
the security element 2. Thereby the light is linearly polarized. With the help of the<br>
detector 11 the presence of the security element 2 can be proven, if the detected light<br>
is linearly polarized. Instead of or additionally to the polarization, the above-<br>
described color effect of the light coming from the security element 2, which is<br>
determined by the type of the lyotropic liquid crystal used, can be evaluated by the<br>
detector 11. If in front of the detector 11 is placed a polarizer 12, which effects a<br>
linear polarization, which in relation to the linear polarization of the security element<br>
2 is turned by 90 degrees, the color effect of the light coming from the security<br>
element 2 will become more intensive. Ideally, the polarizer 12 has a linearly<br>
polarizing layer, which consists of the same lyotropic liquid crystal as the polarizing<br>
layer of the security element 2.<br>
[0061] In Figure 9b the security element 2 is located on the side of the bank note 1<br>
facing the light source 10. The light passing through is depolarized by scattering in <br>
the substrate of the bank note 1; in the detector 11 one observes no polarization and <br>
no color effect. This is the case, for example, in the window security thread at those<br>
places, where it is embedded in the substrate.<br>
[0062] In Figure 10 light source 10 and detector 11 have been interchanged<br>
compared to Figure 9. Figure 10a shows the case, wherein the security element 2 is<br>
illuminated with polarized light and at least the color effect can be viewed also<br>
through the scattering bank note substrate 1, while the transmitted light is<br>
depolarized by the scattering at the substrate of the bank note. Figure 10b shows the<br>
case, wherein in transmitted light no effect occurs, since the light illuminating the<br>
security element 2 is unpolarized, and the linear polarization effected by the<br>
polarizing layer is depolarized by scattering in the bank note substrate.<br>
[0063] Instead of by a detector 11 the check of the security element 2 in diffuse<br>
reflection as well as in transmitted light can be effected also visually by a person,<br>
who checks whether the described color effect occurs.<br>
[0064] By turning the polarizer 12 or 12' or the bank note relative to the<br>
polarization direction, which is given by the illumination or the viewing, moreover,<br>
an increase and decrease of the described color effect can be viewed. When visually<br>
viewing window security threads or other security elements partially embedded in<br>
the bank note substrate, moreover, as a reference a blank effect will always be there,<br>
i.e. places without the described effect.<br>
[0065] The visual testing by a person can be effected especially advantageous and<br>
simple, when the above-described lookthrough register according to the invention is<br>
provided with a polarizing liquid crystal layer. In this case the lookthrough register<br>
can replace the polarizer 12 or 12'. The lookthrough register then can be used for<br>
checking further security elements located on the same bank note, e.g. by folding the<br>
bank note such that the lookthrough register comes to lie above the further security<br>
element. With the lookthrough register the security elements of other bank notes can<br>
also be checked.<br>
[0066] The color changes described above in connection with the polarizing<br>
interference pigments can also be viewed especially well when turning the polarizer <br>
12 or 12'.<br>
[0067] Of course it is also possible to place a polarizer as an analyzer in front of<br>
both the light source 10 and the detector 11 in the Figures 9 and 10. In this case at<br>
least the color effect can always be viewed, independently of the position of the<br>
security element 2.<br>
[0068] The check of a security element according to the invention described with<br>
reference to the Figures 9 and 10 was explained with respect to a security element<br>
applied onto the surface of the substrate of a bank note. It is obvious, that other<br>
designs are possible. For example, a substrate can be used for the bank note, which<br>
does not cause a scattering, e.g. a plastic substrate. Likewise, the security element, as<br>
described above, can be formed as a lookthrough register. In these cases the<br>
depolarization by the substrate as explained in connection with the description of the<br>
Figures 9 and 10 does not Occur.<br>
[0069] The light source 10 can be a light source, which produces white light, e.g.<br>
an incandescent lamp or a gas discharge lamp. The light source 10 can already be<br>
provided with a linear polarizer. However, the light source 10 also may produce light<br>
with a certain, limited spectrum, e.g. when the light source 10 is formed by a light-<br>
emitting diode. If, moreover, the light is to be already linearly polarized, a polarizing<br>
laser diode of low power can be used or for visual viewing a laser pointer can be<br>
used as a light source.<br>
[0070] With the help of the apparatuses for checking bank notes with security<br>
element 2 according to the invention described in the Figures 9 and 10, or when<br>
carrying out the described visual check, the light/dark effects described in connection<br>
with Figure 8 can also be perceived.<br>
