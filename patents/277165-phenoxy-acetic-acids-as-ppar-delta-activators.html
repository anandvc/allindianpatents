				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to novel phenoxy-acetic acids, Pharmaceuticals comprising the same, and methods of using the same. The phenoxy-acetic acids are activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-5.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]   Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of death in Type 2 diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients (i.e., patients that fall within the 'deadly quartet' category of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridaemia and/or obesity). [0003]   The hypolipidaemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones separately display moderately effective triglyceride-lowering activities, although they are neither potent nor efficacious enough to be a single therapy of choice for the dyslipidaemia often observed in Type 2 diabetic or metabolic syndrome patients. The thiazolidinediones also potently lower circulating glucose levels of Type 2 diabetic animal models and humans. However, the fibrate class of compounds are without beneficial effects on glycaemia. Studies on the molecular actions of these compounds indicate that thiazolidinediones and fibrates exert their action by activating distinct transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, resulting in increased and decreased expression of specific enzymes and apol-ipoproteins respectively, both key-players in regulation of plasma triglyceride content. [0004] PPAR-5 activation was initially reported not to be involved in modulation of glucose or triglyceride levels. (Berger et al., JBiol. Chem. 1999,274, 6718-6725). Later it was shown that PPAR-8 activation leads to increased levels of HDL cholesterol in db/db mice (Leibowitz et al., FEBS letters 2000,473, 333-336). Further, a PPAR-5 agonist when dosed to insulin-resistant middle-aged obese rhesus monkeys caused a dramitic dose-dependent rise in serum HDL cholesterol while lowering the levels of small dense LDL, fasting triglycerides and fasting insulin (Oliver et al., PNAS 2001, 98,5306-5311). The same paper also showed that PPAR-8 activation increased the reverse cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette Al and induced apolipoprotein Al-specific cholesterol efflux. The involvement of PPAR-5 in<br>
fatty acid oxidation in muscles was further substantiated in PPAR-a knock-out mice. Muoio et a\. (J. Biol. Chem. 2002,277,26089-26097) showed that the high levels of PPAR-8 in skeletal muscle can compensate for deficiency in PPAR-a. In addition to the effects on cholesterol homeostasis, PPAR5 treatment was observed to lower plasma glucose and insulin and improve insulin sensitivity in diabetic ob/ob and db/db mice and high fat diet induced insulin resistant mice (PNAS 2003, 700,15924-15929; PNAS 2006,103, 3444-3449).Taken together these observations suggest that PPAR-8 activation is useful in the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and conditions including atherosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and mixed dyslipidaemia (WO 01/00603).<br>
A number of PPAR-8 compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (WO 02/59098, WO 01/603, WO 01/25181, WO 02/14291, WO 01/79197, WO 99/4815, WO 97/28149, WO 98/27974, WO 97/28115, WO 97/27857, WO 97/28137, and WO 97/27847). WO 2004093879, WO 2004092117, WO 2004080947, WO 2004080943, WO 2004073606.WO 2004063166, WO 2004063165, WO 2003072100, WO 2004060871, WO 2004005253, WO 2003097607, WO 2003035603, WO 2004000315, WO 2004000762, WO 2003074495, WO 2002070011, WO 2003084916, US 20040209936, WO 2003074050, WO 2003074051, WO 2003074052, JP 2003171275, WO 2003033493, WO 2003016291, WO 2002076957, WO 2002046154, WO 2002014291, WO 2001079197, WO 2003024395, WO 2002059098, WO 2002062774, WO 2002050048, WO 2002028434, WO 2001000603, WO 2001060807, WO 9728149, WO 2001034200, WO 9904815, WO 200125226, WO 2005097098; WO 2005097762; WO 2005097763.<br>
[0005]   Glucose lowering as a single approach does not overcome the macrovascular complications associated with Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Novel treatments of Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome must therefore aim at lowering both the overt hypertriglyc-eridaemia associated with these syndromes as well as alleviation of hyperglycaemia. This indicates that research for compounds displaying various degree of PPAR-8 activation should lead to the discovery of efficacious triglyceride and/or cholesterol and/or glucose lowering drugs that have great potential in the treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipide-<br>
mia, syndrome X (including the metabolic syndrome, i.e., impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertrigyceridaemia and/or obesity), cardiovascular diseases (including atherosclerosis) and hypercholesteremia.<br>

[00397] Typical compositions include a compound of the present invention a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, which may be a carrier or a diluent or be diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier, which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. In making the compositions, conventional techniques for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions may be used. For example, the active compound will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a ampoule, capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be solid, semi-solid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active compound. The active compound can be adsorbed on a granular solid container for example in a sachet. Some examples of suitable carriers are water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, peanut oil, olive oil, gelatine, lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, ac?.cia, stearic acid or lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, silicic acid, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene, hydroxymethylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. The formulations may also include wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavouring agents. The formulations of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures well known in the art.<br>
[00398] The pharmaceutical compositions can be sterilized and mixed, if desired, with auxiliary agents, emulsifiers, salt for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers and/or colouring substances and the like, which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. [00399] The route of administration may be any route, which effectively transports the active compound to the appropriate or desired site of action, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, trans-dermal or parenteral e.g. rectal, depot, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraurethral, intramuscular, intranasal, ophthalmic solution or an ointment, the oral route being preferred. [00400] If a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it can be in the form of a troche or lozenge. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution.<br>
[00401] For nasal administration, the preparation may contain a compound of formula I dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier, in particular an aqueous carrier, for aerosol application. The carrier may contain additives such as solubilizing agents, e.g. propylene glycol, surfactants, absorption enhancers such as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or cyclodextrin, or preservatives such as parabenes.<br>
[00402] For parenteral application, particularly suitable are injectable solutions or suspensions, preferably aqueous solutions with the active compound dissolved in polyhydroxyiated castor oil.<br>
[00403] Tablets, dragees, or capsules having talc and/or a carbohydrate carrier or binder or the like are particularly suitable for oral application. Preferable carriers for tablets, dragees, or capsules include lactose, corn starch, and/or potato starch. A syrup or elixir can be used in cases where a sweetened vehicle can be employed.<br>
[00404] If desired, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a compound of the present invention in combination with further pharmacologically active substances such as those described in the foregoing.<br>
[00405] The compounds of the invention may be administered to a mammal, especially a human in need of such treatment, prevention, elimination, alleviation or amelioration of diseases related to the regulation of blood sugar. Mammals also include animals, both domestic animals, e.g. household pets, and non-domestic animals such as wildlife. [00406] The compounds of the present invention are expected to be effective over a wide dosage range. A typical oral dosage is hi the range of from about 0.001 to about 100 ifig/kg body weight per day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day, and more preferred from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day administered in one or more dosages such as 1 to 3 dosages. The exact dosage will depend upon the frequency and mode of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the subject treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated and any concomitant diseases to be treated and other factors evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00407] The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known to those skilled in the art. A typical unit dosage form for oral administration one or more times per day such as 1 to 3 times per day may contain of from 0.05 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 0.1 to about 500 mg, and more preferred from about 0.5 mg to about 200 mg.<br>

Some of the preferred methods include use of microbial resolution, enzymatic resolution, resolving the diastereo-meric salts formed with chiral acids such as mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, and lactic acid wherever applicable or chiral bases such as brucine, (R$)- or (S)-phenyl-ethylamine, cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives. Commonly used methods are compiled by Jaques et al in "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution" (Wiley Interscience, 1981). More specifically a compound of the present invention may be converted to a 1:1 mixture of diastereomeric amides by treating with chiral amines, aminoacids, aminoalcohols derived from aminoacids; conventional reaction conditions may be employed to convert acid into an amide; the diastereomers may be separated either by fractional crystallization or chromatog-raphy and the stereoisomers of compound of formula I may be prepared by hydrolysincr the pure diastereomeric amide.<br>
[00429] The invention also encompasses prodrugs of the present compounds, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological substances. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present compounds, which are readily convertible in vivo into a compound of the present invention. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>

 (scheme Removed)<br>
 [00435] The synthetic intermediate of formula I with Rl = H, R2 =Br and a carboxylic ester group e.g. [4-(3-Bromo-5-hydroxy-phenylsulfanyl)-2-methyl-phenoxy]-acetic acid ethyl acetate can be converted via a classical Mitsunobu reaction or a reaction can be performed between the phenol and an alkyl halides (or an alkyle mesylate, triflate, tosylate or alike) to a new intermediate of formula I where X1-R1 forms a ether or thioether group and R = Br. The new intermediate can be converted via a classical Sonogashira, Heck or Suzuki coupling protocol to a new intermediate where R2 is -OC-R2", -CH=CH-R2a or a substituted or non substituted aryl or heteroaryl. It is also possible to perform the reaction in the opposite way by first performing the Sonogashira, Heck or Suzuki coupling followed by the ether forming reaction as described above. The claimed compounds can also be performed as described for [4-(3-Bromo-5-cyclopropylmethoxy-phenylsulfanyl)-2-methyl-phenoxy]-acetic acid ethyl ester by condensing e.g. l,3-dibromo-5-cyclopropylmethoxy-benzene or another substituted dibromo • phenyle ether with (4-Mercapto-2-methyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid ethyl ester or another substituted mercaptobezene. The intermediates formed can be converted to the claimed compounds by a classical ester hydrolyses reaction from the respective esters of I (scheme 1-3).<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS IN VITRO PPAR-8 ACTIVATION ACTIVITY<br>
[00808] The PPAR transient transactivation assay is based on transient transfection into human HEK293 cells of two plasmids encoding a chimeric test protein and a reporter protein respectively. The chimeric test protein is a fusion of the DNA binding domain (DBD) from the yeast GAL4 transcription factor to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the human PPAR proteins. The PPAR-LBD moiety harbored in addition to the ligand binding pocket also the native activation domain (activating function 2 = AF2) allowing the fusion protein to function as a PPAR ligand dependent transcription factor. The GAL4 DBD will direct the chimeric protein to bind only to Gal4 enhancers (of which none existed in HEK293 cells). The reporter plasmid contained a Gal4 enhancer driving the expression of the firefly luciferase protein. After transfection, HEK293 cells expressed the GAL4-DBD-PPAR-LBD fusion protein. The fusion protein will in turn bind to the Gal4 enhancer controlling the luciferase expression, and do nothing in the absence of ligand. Upon addition to the cells of a PPAR ligand luciferase protein will be produced in amounts corresponding to the activation of the PPAR protein. The amount of luciferase protein is measured by light emission after addition of the appropriate substrate.<br>
CELL CULTURE AND TRANSFECTION<br>
[00809] HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM + 10% PCS. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates the day before transfection to give a confluency of 50-80 % at transfection. A total of 0,8 ng DNA containing 0,64 ug pMlo/LBD, 0,1 ug pCMVßGal, 0,08 ug pGL2(Ga!4)5 and 0,02 ug pADVANTAGE was transfected per well using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Roche). Cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h followed by addition of compound.<br>
[00810] Plasmids: Human PPAR-8 was obtained by PCR amplification using cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription of mRNA from human liver, adipose tissue and plancenta respectively. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The ligand binding domain (LBD) of each PPAR isoform was generated by PCR (PPAR6: aa 128 - C-terminus) and fused to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 by sub-<br>
cloning fragments in frame into the vector pMl (Sadowski et al. (1992), Gene 118,137) generating the plasmids pMlaLBD, pMlyLBD and pM18. Ensuing fusions were verified by sequencing. The reporter was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding five repeats of the GAL4 recognition sequence (5 x CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG(AG)) (Webster et al. (1988), Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 8192) into the vector pGL2 promoter (Promega) generating the plasmid pGL2(GAL4)5. pCMVßGal was purchased from Clontech and pADVANTAGE was purchased from Promega.<br>
IN VITRO TRANSACTIVATION ASSAY<br>
[00811] Compounds: All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 upon addition to the cells. Compounds were tested in quadruple in concentrations ranging from O.OO1 to 300 uM. Cells were treated with compound for 24 h followed by luciferase assay. Each compound was tested in at least two separate experiments.<br>
[00812] Luciferase assay: Medium including test compound was aspirated and 100 µl PBS incl.1mM Mg++ and Ca++ were added to each well. The luciferase assay was performed using the LucLite kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Packard Instruments). Light emission was quantified by counting on a Packard LumiCounter. To measure 0-galactosidase activity 25µl supernatant from each transfection lysate was transferred to a new microplate. ß-Galactosidase assays were performed in the microwell plates using a kit from Promega and read in a Labsystems Ascent Multiscan reader. The p-galactosidase data were used to normalize (transfection efficiency, cell growth etc.) the luciferase data.<br>
STATISTICAL METHODS<br>
[00813] The activity of a compound is calculated as fold induction compared to an untreated sample. For each compound the efficacy (maximal activity) is given as a relative activity compared to Wy 14,643 for PPARa, Rosiglitazone for PPAR and Carbacyclin for PPAR8. The EC50 is the concentration giving 50% of maximal observed activity. EC50 values were calculated via non-linear regression using GraphPad PRISM 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Ca).<br>
