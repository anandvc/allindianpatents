The   invention   relates   to   a  device    for<br>
attaching an electrical component to a mounting base and for connecting it galvanically to a terminal block connected to the mounting base. The arrangement of the invention is particularly suitable for use with components carrying higher currents, for example inductive  components  such  as  measuring  transformers.<br>
If the mounting base is a printed board, various soldering techniques are typically employed for attaching electrical components mechanically to the mounting base and for connecting them electrically to the terminal block connected to the mounting base. However, such techniques cannot be employed with higher currents, since the cross-sectional area of copper foil strips on conventional printed boards is not sufficient for conducting such currents. A typical example of a component carrying higher currents is a measuring transformer. In the following, known solutions will be dealt with particularly in the case of measuring transformers.<br>
Transformers implemented as laminated core transformers are typically attached to the mounting base by iron binders which are secured to the base either by screws or other mechanical fasteners, such as rivets, or by bending the ends of the iron binders so that they attach the transformer mechanically to the base. The terminals for the primary and secondary winding in the transformers are provided by unfixed conductors. This conventional securing technique involves the laborious step of securing the iron binders. Providing the terminals in the transformers by unfixed conductors, in turn,    entails   the   possibility   of   faulty   coupling;    in<br><br>
addition, it is very difficult to check the coupling visually, particularly if the there are several measuring transformers on the base, which is often the case.<br>
In the same way as a laminated core transÂ¬former, it is possible to attach a toroidal transformer mechanically to the base either from its case or by a fastening means screwed through its centre. Even in this case, the terminals for the primary and secondary winding are provided by unfixed conductors. A toroidal transformer is thus not different from a laminated core transformer as regards the problems associated with the securing  and  coupling.<br>
One alternative is to attach the transformer to a printed board from solder-tags and to provide the wiring by means of copper foil strips on the printed board. This printed board solution is, however, often uneconomic, since the copper foil strips must be made thicker than usual in order to provide conductors with a sufficient cross-sectional area. Moreover, the requirements set by the norms for the current-carrying capacity  are  not  met   if   soft   soldering   is   used.<br>
Transformers which are moulded in plastic and in which terminals are soldered to the ends of the primary windings are also used to some extent in the field. However, moulding transformers in plastic requires large series, and because of the many different combinations, the production control and storage incur extra costs. The more there are transformers, the more difficult it is to mount them on a base and to provide a  compact   construction.<br>
It should also be noted that in the case of measuring transformers it is necessary to apply the norm DIN 57435, concerning static measuring and protection relays.    According   to   this   norm,    the    requirement    for<br><br>
continuous current-carrying capacity is a quadruple nominal current, the requirement for continuous thermal current-carrying capacity for one second is a hundredfold nominal current, and the requirement for dynamic current-carrying capacity is 2,5-fold thermal current-carrying capacity for one half-cycle. If the nominal current is, for example, 5 A, the requirement for continuous thermal current-carrying capacity grows to 500 A for 1 s, and the requirement for dynamic current-carrying   capacity  grows   to   1250  A.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a new type of solution for attaching electrical components, particularly inductive components such as measuring transformers, to a mounting base, and for wiring their primary circuit rapidly and without the possibility of faulty coupling. This is achieved with an arrangement of the invention, which is characterized in that the terminal block comprises a first contact piece of a plug-in connector, and the component comprises a second contact piece of the plug-iu connector, and that the com;ponent and the mounting base comprise interlocking parts for attaching the component to the base, whereby when the component is locked to the base, the contact pieces of the plug-in connector provide a galvanic contact between the component and the terminal  block.<br>
When the arrangement of the invention is applied, the transformers are thus locked mechanically to the base by means of snap-in-type locking means, as the transformers and the mounting base are provided with elements which interlock with each other. Such a mechanical locking also provides an electrical contact between     the     contact     piece     of     the     terminal     block<br>
connected   to   the	mounting   base   and   the   complementary<br>
contact  piece  attached  to  the  electrical  component.   The<br><br>
terminal block preferably comprises the male contact piece of the plug-in connector, whereas the electrical component comprises its female contact piece. It is thus possible to encase the female contact piece neatly in the frame of the component. The male contact piece can be easily shaped as a bus bar, which is guided to a groove reserved for it when the terminal block module is  mounted.<br>
When a plurality of electrical components are attached to a mounting base in the arrangement of the invention, the components are preferably arranged on the mounting base in two or more rows so that the components in these rows are interposed with respect to each other, and each terminal block preferably comprises two contact pieces: a first one at the first row of components and a second one at the second row of components. This arrangement makes the construction compact and eliminates the possibility of faulty coupling. In addition, electrical coupling to a component in either the first or the second row can be performed by means of a similar terminal block. It is therefore necessary to have terminal blocks of only one kind, which is clearly  an  advantage  in  view  of  rationalization.<br>
When the electrical component is a measuring transformer, the galvanic contact between the terminal block and the component preferably comprises a contact with the primary winding of the measuring transformer. The primary winding is the part of the measuring transformer where the strength of the current is several amperes, and thus the current cannot be conducted through copper foil strips of conventional printed boards, especially if the above-mentioned requirements set by DIN 57435 for the current-carrying capacity are taken   into  account.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for attaching an electrical component to a mounting base and for connecting it galvanically to a terminal block connected to the mounting base, characterized in that the terminal block comprises a first contact piece of a plug-in connector, and the component comprises a second contact piece of the plug-in connector, and that the component and the mounting base comprise interlocking parts for attaching the component to the base, whereby when the component is locked to the base, the contact pieces of the plug-in connector provide a galvanic contact between the component and the terminal block.<br>
In the following, the arrangement of the<br><br>
invention    will    be    described    in    greater    detail    with reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings,   in  which<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of a base suitable for use in the arrangement of the invention and of an illustrative embodiment   of  a  terminal   block  to  be  connected  to   it,<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-section of the terminal block  shown   in   Figure   1,<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of the arrangement of Figure 1 when the terminal blocks have been attached to the mounting base and the electrical components   are  being  attached  thereto,   and<br>
Figure 4 is a more detailed view of the electrical component and its electrical coupling to the contact  piece  of  the   terminal  block.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an 1 1 lust rat j ve embodiment- of a mounting base suitable for use in the arrangement of the invention. The mounting base comprises a plurality of compartments or recesses into which the electrical componenLs can be pressed so-that the shape of the mounting base guides each component to its correct place. The base is provided with a plurality of locking tongues or the-like 9, by means of which the components are locked in place after being pressed into their final positions on the base. To enable such a snap-in-type locking, the electrical component is naturally provided with a suitable counterpart for receiving the locking tongues. The mounting base 1 and the electrical component are also provided with other cooperating parts which guide the component to its correct position on the mounting base. In this application, such cooperating parts and the snap-in-type locking tongues or corresponding locking means provided in them will be called interlocking parts.     Interlocking    parts    of    this     kind,     which    are<br><br>
indicated in the drawings by way of an example by reference numerals 8 and 9, also guide the component when it is pressed into its place and lock ir in its desired final position. The purpose of the interlocking parts and the locking means is to support the components and to lock them onto the mounting base so firmly that the components are not detached under any mechanical stresses.<br>
Figure 1 further shows an illustrative embodiment of terminal blocks 2 to be connected to the edge of the mounting base 1. In Figure 1, the terminal blocks 2 form a terminal block module intended for a plurality of electrical components. The terminal block module illustrated in Figure 1 is suitable for connecting five measuring transformers, since one measuring transformer requires three terminal blocks. To facilitate the mounting, the terminal blocks have, however, been combined to form larger terminal block modules (com.prising e.g. 15 terminals as in Figure 1), which are also locked to the edge of the^ mounting base by means of snap-in-type locking tongues. These locking tongues can be seen in Figure 1, where they are indicated by reference numerals 11. Locking tongues are provided both above and below the terminal blocks for locking the terminal block module reliably in its place. For connections to be made at its end facing the base, the terminal block 2, shown in cross-section in Figure 2, comprises a bus bar 5 with two flat male contacts 4 and 6. When the terminal block of Figure 2 is pushed into its place at the edge of the mounting base 1, the bus bar 5 is placed in a groove provided in the mounting base so that the contact pieces 4, 6 remain visible to allow an electrical connection to be made to one of them. The conductor which carries the signal to be   measured   to   the   terminal   block   2   is   connected   in   a<br><br>
conventional manner by means of a connection screw to a contact strip 12 disposed within the case of the terminal block. A current or voltage signal to be measured  is   thus   applied  to  these   terminal  blocks.<br>
In the case illustrated in Figure 3, the terminal block module is inserted in its place at the edge of the mounting base 1, and the other end of the space reserved for terminal blocks is covered with a covering plate 13. Figure 3 also shows a number of measuring transformers 3 to be attached to the mounting base. As stated above, the terminal block module shown in the figure is sufficient for connecting only five measuring transformers; in practice, these would be the five transformers farthest on the left in Figure 3, three of them in the front row, i.e. the row closer to the front panel, and two in the back row. As shown in Figure 3, a measuring transformer is attached to the mounting base 1 by bringing it at first to the correct position above the mounting base and by press-^ncf it then into the correct place on the mounting base so that the cooperating parts of the mounting base and the measuring transformer interlock with each other. Thereafter the measuring transformer 3 is pushed towards the terminal block 2, whereby the locking means lock the measuring transformer 3 in its place; at the same time, an electrical contact is formed between the contact piece 7 of the measuring transformer 3 and the contact piece 4 or 6 of the terminal block 2. This is illustrated in greater  detail   in   Figure   4.<br>
Figure 4 shows an illustrative embodiment of a measuring transformer suitable for use with a mounting base of the invention. The coil former illustrated differs from a conventional one in that it comprises parts, or attachment lugs 8, interlocking with the mounting  base   1  for  attaching  the  transformer  thereto.<br><br>
The  manufacture  of  a  measuring,  transformer  according  to<br>
Figure   4    comprises    the   steps   of   winding   a   secondary<br>
winding   onto   a   coil   former,   and   soldering   its   ends   14<br>
to   solder   lugs   15   positioned   at   the   end   of   the   coil<br>
former  opposite  to  the  attachment  lugs.   In  order  to  wind<br>
the  two  primary  windings  of  the  transformer,   the  wires<br>
needed   for  each  primary  winding   are   at   first   cut,    and<br>
their  ends  are  provided  with  crimp  terminals   7   in   such<br>
a  way  that  one  end  of  each  wire  is  inserted  into  a  crimp<br>
terminal  7  common  to  all  the  windings.   Subsequently,   the<br>
first   terminal   is  pushed  into   a   space  provided   for   it<br>
in   the   coil   former,    and   is   snappingly   locked   in   its<br>
place.   The   first  winding  portion   is   thereafter  wound,<br>
,nd   the   contact    connecting   the   first   and   the    second<br>
'inding  portion  is  positioned  in  the  space  provided  for<br>
t.   The   second  winding   portion   is   then   wound,    and   the<br>
hird  contact   is   inserted   in   its  place   in   the   same  way<br>
s     the    two    preceding    ones.     Subsequently,     the     E/I<br>
ransformer  plates  16  are  piled  up,   ana  the  transformer<br>
s  varnished.   At  this  stage,   the  transformer  is   in   the<br>
orm  shown  in   Figure   4   and  ready  to  be   inserted  in   its<br>
lace  on  the  mounting  base.<br>
When a transformer is inserted in its place, he attachment lugs of the coil former are pressed into orresponding grooves on the mounting base, and the ransformer is moved a few millimetres tov.'ards the erminal block 2, whereby an electrical contact is ormed between the female contacts 7 in the transformer nd the contacts 6 connected to the bus bars 5 of the Brminal blocks. In this case, the transformer is Dnnected to the second row, i.e. to the row further trom  the  front  panel.   If  the  transformer  were  positioned<br>
1	the  row  which  is  closer  to  the  front  panel,   it  would<br>
2	connected to   the   contact   piece   4   of   the   terminal<br>
Lock  2.<br><br>
Ah can be seen from Figure 3, the transformers in the first and the second row are interposed with respect to each other. This saves room on the mounting base, and in addition, helps to avoid faulty conÂ¬nections, as it is not possible to connect a transformer to both contact pieces 4 and 6 of the terminal block 2 at   the   same  time.<br>
Of measuring transformers, current transformers are those whose primary windings carry a higher current, wherefore they are mounted using the arrangement of the invention. They must therefore be mounted either in the first or in the second row from the front panel. Voltage transformers, in turn, can be mounted in any row, i.e. in the first or second row, or in the third row, which is not connected to the term.inal blocks 2. The connections of both the primary and the secondary windinas of the vnJtane transformers to be mounted in the third row are made through solder peaks 17 which can be seen en top of the transformers. In practice, this isvperformed in such a way that after the transformers have been locked onto the base, a printed board with through holes for the solder peaks is placed on top of the transformers 3, and the solder peaks are soldered in a conventional manner to the copper foil strips on the printed board. This procedure is followed with the connections of the secondary windings of the voltage and current transformers in both the first and the second row, and with the connections of both the primary and the secondary windings of voltage transformers in the third row, since the currents in these windings are so low that they can be conducted through copper foil strips  of  the  printed  board.<br>
The arrangement of the invention allows a combination of measuring transformers needed for each specific    case    to    be    manufactured    extremely    simply.<br><br>
reliably and rapidly. The correct mounting of the measuring transformers can be easily ensured by providing the measuring transformers with clearly visible indications of their type. No other information is needed, as the terminals of both the primary and the secondary winding are located in their fixed places in the  coil   former.<br>
In the above, the arrangement of the invention has been described by way of an example with reference to only one embodiment. It will be understood that, as regards the appearance, the invention can be modified even significantly according to the electrical component to be used without departing from the scope of protection defined by the appended claims or from the basic idea of the invention, according to v;hich components  are   locked  to  a  mounting  base  by  mechanical<br><br>
mechanical locking takes place, an electrical contact is also formed between a first contact piece in the component and a second contact piece on the mounting base.<br><br><br>
