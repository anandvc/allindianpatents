The present invention relates to a Steckel mill or coiler rolling mill with at least one reversing stand and drivers and coiler furnaces arranged on the entry side and the exit side of the reversing stand  wherein the reversing stand, the drivers and the coiler furnaces are connected to one another through roller conveyors  for  the  strip  to  be  rolled.<br>
Steckel mills of the adobe-described type have long been known in the art. They operate as follows. The prerolled strip is introduced into the reversing stand under the coiler furnace on the entry side and through the driver on the entry side. After the first pass, the rolling stock is introduced into the coiler furnace on the exit side. After the start of coiling of the strip in the coiler furnace on. the exit side, a predetermined strip tension is applied between the coiler furnace and the reversing stand cud the strip is rolled at the appropriate speed. When the strip end enters the Steckel mill, the plant is decelerated to such an extent that  the  strip  end comes  to a  standstill  behind the  roll  gap  of  the<br><br>
reversing stand but in front of the driver on the exit side. During the reversing operation, the roll gap is adjusted for the next pass. The driver on the exit side introduces the strip into the reversing stand for beginning the next pass. After the beginning of the second pass, the strip is introduced into the coiler furnace on the entry side. At the end of the second pass, the strip beginning comes to a standstill between the driver on the entry  side  and  the  reversing  stand.<br>
During the reversing operation which, as described above, includes the steps of decelerating the strip, run out of the strip from the coiler furnace, reversing the strip, beginning the next pass and introducing the strip into the coiler furnace, the strip end as well as the strip beginning are cooled to a greater extent as compared to the middle portion of the strip. The increased cooling is caused by the fact that these strip portions are bleatingly not maintained at a high temperature in the coiler furnaces during the reversing operation. At least during the first passes, an additional cooling occurs at the strip beginning and at the strip end when these strip portions are wound onto a cooled mandrel of the coiler furnace which is adjusted to a certain temperature.<br><br>
Due to the cold portions at the beginning and the end of the strip, the rolling force increases substantially during the pass as compared to the middle portion of the strip. Accordingly, the reversing stand must be designed for the high rolling forces occurring as a result. Because of extreme peaks of the rolling force at the cold portions at the beginning and end of the strip, changes in thickness and/or planeness of the strip can occur over the length of the strip. Accordingly, the rolling stock has a lower quality or relatively large quantities of  scrap are produced.<br><br>
SUMMARY  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to further develop a Steckel mill of the above-described type in such a way that no significant variations in the rolling force occur over the length of the strip, and that the strip is rolled with  uniform  quality  and  scrap  is  avoided.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, at least one heating unit is provided in at least one of the sections formed between the coiler furnaces and the reversing stand, wherein the heating unit covers  at  least  a  portion  of  the  respective  section.<br>
The solution proposed in accordance with the present invention provides the result that especially that portion of the strip which is not located within the heated coiler furnace can be raised to a temperature corresponding to the temperature of the remaining strip, so that the rolling force is not subject to large variations at least with respect to the temperature pattern over the length of the  strip.<br>
In accordance with a further development of the present invention, a heating uppity is provided on each side of the reversing stand,   so   that   not   only   the   temperature   of   the   strip   beginning<br><br>
coming to a standstill in front of the reversing stand can be maintained at the desired level, but also the temperature of the strip  end  coming  to  a  standstill  behind  the  reversing  stand.<br>
As a rule, the drivers on the entry side and the exit side are arranged very closely to the respective coiler furnaces, so that the arrangement of the heating units between the drivers and the reversing  stand  is  completely  sufficient.<br>
For quickly and reliquary heating the strip beginning and the strip end, heating units can be provided above the roller conveyors as well as below the roller conveyors. If heating units are provided above and below the roller conveyors, it is advantageous to use the heating units individually as required or to use all heating  units  together  for  heating  the  strip.<br>
The heating processes can be controlled particularly sin5&gt;ly and accurately if, in accordance with either proposal, the heating unit  is  an  induction  heating  unit.<br>
In  accordance  with  another  feature  of  the  present  invention, the  heating  unit  includes  a  control  device  which  is  provided  with the  desired  values  of  the  strip  temperature  and  the  actual  values of  the  strip temperature.    This  heating unit  has  the advantage  that<br><br>
not only the strip beginning and the strip end can be heated as required, but also cold portions within the strip can be recognized and heated if the temperature thereof is below the predetermined desired value of the strip temperature. As is conventional in control technology, it is useful to permit a certain band width of the actual values of the strip temperature, so that the heating unit does continuously switch on and off already at very small strip  temperature  variations.<br>
In accordance with another feature, a position-dependent heating of the strip, as well as a combination of the control of the heating unit in dependence on the strip position and the strip temperature  is  possible.<br>
If a switching device is provided which activates only that heating unit which is arranged in the respective strip travel direction in front of the reversing stamd, it is ensured that the strip is appropriately heated prior to the pass in the reversing stem, while the strip emerging from the reversing stand is not subjected  to  a  heating  process.<br>
The various features of novelty which characterize the<br>
invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed<br>
to    and    forming    a    part    of    the    disclosure.	For    a    better<br><br>
understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to the drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a Steckel mill comprising at least one reversing stand having an entry side and an exit side for strip to be rolled, drivers and coiler furnaces arranged on the entry side and the exit side of the reversing stand, and a roller conveyor for the strip to be rolled for connecting the reversing stand with the drivers and the coiler furnaces, further comprising at least one heating unit in at least one section between the coiler furnaces and the reversing stand, wherein the heating unit covers at least a portion of the section.<br>
