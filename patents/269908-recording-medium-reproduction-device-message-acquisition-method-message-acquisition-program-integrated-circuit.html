				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RECORDING MEDIUM, REPRODUCTION DEVICE, MESSAGE ACQUISITION METHOD,<br>
MESSAGE ACQUISITION PROGRAM, INTEGRATED CIRCUIT<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for displaying a<br>
message to the user during content playback, especially to a technology<br>
for displaying a message reflecting an intention of a content provider.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
A widely prevailing system, along with the development of higher-<br>
capacity recording media in recent years, is one to digitize content<br>
data of copyrighted works, such as movies, and distribute the digitaized<br>
data stored in digital optical disks or other recording media. With the<br>
use of such a system, copyright protection of the content data is<br>
necessary, and playback and duplication of the content data must be<br>
conducted only within the limits to which the copyright holders have<br>
consented. A common system used for protecting copyrighted works from<br>
being illegally copied without consent of the copyright holders has a<br>
mechanism in which content data is encrypted using a content key that is<br>
managed by the copyright holder and then stored in a disk, and only<br>
terminals having a corresponding content key can decrypt the encrypted<br>
content data in the disk. Here, in order to obtain the content key, an<br>
agreement with the copyright holder on provisions regarding copyright<br>
protection must be made.<br>
[0003]<br>
1<br><br>
This kind of system has means for informing the user of a<br>
playback anomaly in the case when a playback anomaly caused by some<br>
reasons during playback is determined on a terminal apparatus that plays<br>
back content data read from a recording medium, as disclosed in Patent<br>
Reference 1.<br><patent reference> Japanese Laid-ppen Patent Application H08-<br>
186795<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the conventional technology, messages used for<br>
informing the user of anomalies are decided by the manufacturer of the<br>
playback apparatus, and the problem therefore remains that the content<br>
provider cannot control the messages.<br>
Therefore, the present invention aims at offering a recording<br>
medium, a playback apparatus, a message acquisition method, a message<br>
acquisition program, and an integrated circuit of the playback apparatus,<br>
all of which allow the content provider to control messages.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problem]<br>
[0005]<br>
In order to achieve the object above, the present invention is a<br>
recording medium provided by content provider and recording thereon<br>
content and a program which is executed during playback of the content<br>
by a playback apparatus. The program causes the playback apparatus to<br>
execute: an interacting step of interacting with a different program<br>
that is prestored in the playback apparatus and executed during the<br>
playback of the content; and an output step of transmitting, to the<br>
2<br><br>
different program, a message determined according to the result of the<br>
interaction.<br>
[Advantageous Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0006]<br>
According to the structure above, since the recording medium<br>
records thereon a program including an output step of transmitting a<br>
message in accordance with the result of the interaction, the playback<br>
apparatus can receive a message in accordance with the result of the<br>
interaction with the recording medium. Herewith, the content provider<br>
is capable of controlling messages to be output to the playback<br>
apparatus by recording the program on the recording medium.<br>
[0007]<br>
In this case, the interaction step may acquire apparatus unique<br>
information unique to the playback apparatus by interacting with the<br>
different program, and the output step may output, to the different<br>
program, a message determined according to the apparatus unique<br>
information.<br>
According to the structure above, since the output step of the<br>
program recorded on the recording medium outputs a message in accordance<br>
with the apparatus unique information, the content provider is capable<br>
of controlling messages to be output according to the apparatus unique<br>
information.<br>
[0008]<br>
In this case, the output step may include: an acquisition step<br>
of acquiring, according to the apparatus unique information, a message<br>
which the playback apparatus is capable of displaying; and a<br>
transmission step of transmitting the acquired message to the different<br>
program.<br>
3<br><br>
According to the structure above, the program recorded on the<br>
recording medium acquires a message which the playback apparatus is<br>
capable of displaying according to the apparatus unique information, and<br>
transmits the acquired message to a different program in the playback<br>
apparatus. Herewith, the content provider is capable of causing the<br>
playback apparatus to display messages to be output according to the<br>
apparatus unique information.<br>
[0009]<br>
In this case, the acquisition step may acquire, in the case where<br>
the apparatus unique information indicates that the playback apparatus<br>
is unauthorized or anomalous, a message indicating that the playback<br>
apparatus is unauthorized or anomalous.<br>
According to the structure above, in the case where the playback<br>
apparatus is unauthorized or anomalous, the acquisition step of the<br>
program recorded on the recording medium acquires a message indicating<br>
accordingly. Herewith, the content provider is capable of notifying the<br>
user that the playback apparatus is an unauthorized or anomalous<br>
apparatus.<br>
[0010]<br>
In this case, the interacting step may acquire apparatus state<br>
information indicating an operating state of the playback apparatus by<br>
interacting with the different program, and the output step may transmit,<br>
to the different program, a message determined according to the<br>
apparatus state information.<br>
According to the structure above, since the output step of the<br>
program recorded on the recording medium outputs a message in accordance<br>
with the apparatus state information, the content provider is capable of<br>
4<br><br>
controlling messages to be output according to the apparatus state<br>
information.<br>
[0011]<br>
In this case, the output step may include: an acquisition step<br>
of acquiring, according to the apparatus state information, a message<br>
which the playback apparatus is capable of displaying; and a<br>
transmission step of transmitting the acquired message to the different<br>
program.<br>
According to the structure above, the program recorded on the<br>
recording medium acquires a message which the playback apparatus is<br>
capable of displaying according to the apparatus state information, and<br>
transmits the acquired message to a different program in the playback<br>
apparatus. Herewith, the content provider is capable of causing the<br>
playback apparatus to display messages to be output according to the<br>
apparatus state information.<br>
[0012]<br>

recording medium includes the process selection step, it can cause the<br>
playback apparatus to perform either inhibition of the playback of the<br>
content or overlay display of a message based on an instruction of the<br>
user.<br>
In this case, the program may include control information<br>
indicating performing one of (1) an operation of inhibiting the playback<br>
of the content and (2) an operation of displaying the message over an<br>
image of the content being played back, and the output step may further<br>
transmit the control information to the different program.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0029]<br>
The following explains the best modes for implementing the<br>
present invention with reference to drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT 1<br>
FIG. 1 shows structures of a recording medium 101 and a content<br>
playback apparatus 102 of one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
On the recording medium 101, playback control information 111, a<br>
bytecode 112, protected content data 113, an encrypted content key 114,<br>
and revocation information 115 are recorded. As the recording medium<br>
101, a BD (Blu-ray Disc) is, for example, assumed here; however, other<br>
types of recording media may also be used.<br>
[0030]<br>
Embodiment 1 assumes that one content is composed of multiple<br>
pieces of MPEG2-TS (Motion Picture Expert Group 2-Transport Stream) data.<br>
It is the playback control information 111 that specifies the playback<br>
order of the protected content data 113 when the content is played back.<br>
A JAVA (registered trademark) bytecode is an example of the<br>
bytecode 112, which is an executable code composed of fixed-length<br>
instruction sets. Some process, such as obfuscation of bytecode, may be<br>
performed so that confidential information and detailed processes<br>
included in the software are not revealed by analytical techniques. In<br>
this case, the bytecode execution unit 124 has a function of removing<br>
the obfuscation or the like. Details on the execution performed by the<br>
bytecode 112 are described later. Note that the present embodiment is<br>
14<br><br>
described using a JAVA, byte code as an example; however, an execution<br>
program other than that can be employed.<br>
[0031]<br>
The protected content data 113 is data created by performing an<br>
encryption process on MPEG2-TS data using a content key. Here, MPEG2-TS<br>
data is the data in plaintext which can output image using a decoder.<br>
Therefore, in order to play back the protected content data 113, a<br>
decryption process using the content key needs to be performed on the<br>
protected content data 113 to thereby restore the plain-text MPEG2-TS<br>
data.<br>
The encrypted content key 114 is data created by, with the use of<br>
a media key, encrypting the content key used for decrypting the<br>
protected content data. The media key is explained later.<br>
[0032]<br>
Next, the revocation information 115 is described. The key<br>
management authority has a group of multiple device keys and multiple<br>
media keys. The key management authority assigns one device key and a<br>
key ID number of the device key to each content playback apparatus 102,<br>
and gives the assigned device key and key ID number to the content<br>
playback apparatus 102. Also, the key management authority assigns one<br>
media key to the recording medium 101. Next, the key management<br>
authority creates an encrypted media key by encrypting a media key using<br>
the device key assigned to each content playback apparatus 102, and<br>
creates a list itemizing encrypted media keys and key ID numbers for all<br>
device keys.<br>
[0033]<br>
This list is the revocation information 115. Note however that<br>
this simple method has a shortcoming that, as the number of the content<br>
15<br><br>
playback apparatuses 102 becomes large, the data size of the revocation<br>
information 115 becomes unrealistically large. Therefore, a method<br>
disclosed in "Digital Content Hogo-you Kagi Kanri Houshiki (Key<br>
Management Method for Protecting Digital Contents)" (Nakano, Ohmori and<br>
Tatebayashi, Symposium on Cryptography and Information Security,<br>
SCIS2001 5A-5, Jan. 2001) can be used to compress the revocation<br>
information 115 to thereby reduce the data size. The data compression<br>
method is not limited to this, and a different method may also be<br>
adopted.<br>
[0034]<br>
The content playback apparatus 102 comprises: a disk reading<br>
unit 121; a playback control unit 122; a user operation reception unit<br>
123; a bytecode execution unit 124; a decryption unit 125; a<br>
demultiplexing unit 127; a video decoder 128; an audio decoder 129; a<br>
content key generation unit 130; a revocation information processing<br>
unit 131; a device key storage unit 132; an apparatus unique information<br>
storage unit 133; a display control unit 134; and a display unit 135.<br>
[0035]<br>
A computer system composed of a CPU, a work memory, a flash<br>
memory, a BD drive and a remote controller is a practical embodiment of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102. The disk reading unit 121 is the BD<br>
drive; the device key storage unit 132 and apparatus unique information<br>
storage unit 133 are the flash memory; and the user operation reception<br>
unit 123 is the remote controller. The playback control unit 122, byte<br>
code execution unit 124, decryption unit 125, demultiplexing unit 127,<br>
video decoder 128, audio decoder 129, content key generation unit 130,<br>
revocation information processing unit 131, display control unit 134,<br>
and display unit 135 can be configured by software operating with the<br>
16<br><br>
use of the CPU and work memory; however, these units can be realized by<br>
hardware implementation, and the present invention is not limited to the<br>
software implementation.<br>
[0036]<br>
Thus concludes the descriptions on the structures of the<br>
recording medium and the content playback apparatus, which are one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Content Playback Process<br>
The following describes a content playback process with reference<br>
to FIG. 2.<br>
First, the content playback process starts when a user's request<br>
for content playback start is received by the user operation reception<br>
unit 123.<br>
[0037]<br>
When the user operation reception unit 123 receives a content<br>
playback request, the content playback apparatus 102 reads the bytecode<br>
112 from the recording medium 101, and the bytecode 112 is executed by<br>
the bytecode execution unit 124 (Step S201). The detailed description<br>
of the process performed by the bytecode execution unit 124 is given<br>
later.<br>
In the case where the content playback process is continued as<br>
result of Step S201, the following steps are carried out.<br>
The revocation information processing unit 131 performs the<br>
revocation confirmation process of the content playback apparatus 102<br>
(S202). The detail of the revocation confirmation process is described<br>
later.<br>
[0038]<br>
17<br><br>
The subsequent process branches depending on whether the<br>
generation of the media key in the revocation confirmation process S202<br>
is successful or not (S203).<br>
When the generation of the media key in the revocation<br>
confirmation process S202 is successful, the content playback apparatus<br>
102 reads the encrypted content key 114 from the recording medium 101<br>
and generates a content key (S204) . The detail of the content key<br>
generation is described later.<br>
[0039]<br>
If the generation of the media key in the revocation confirmation<br>
process S202 fails, the content playback apparatus 102 aborts the<br>
process.<br>
After the completion of S204, in order to play back a content<br>
requested by the user, the playback control unit 122 instructs start of<br>
reading the protected content data 113, which is to be a playback target,<br>
in accordance with the playback control information 111 (S205) .<br>
Until all the protected content data 113 is read, the following<br>
process is repeated (S206) .<br>
[0040]<br>
Using the content key generated by the content key generation<br>
unit 130, the decryption unit 125 performs a decryption process on the<br>
protected content data 113 read from the recording medium 101 (S207) .<br>
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for the encryption of the<br>
protected content data; however, the present invention is not limited to<br>
this. The decrypted content data is MPEG2-TS data in plain text, which<br>
is then demultiplexed into video and audio streams by the demultiplexing<br>
unit 127. These video and audio streams are sent to the video decoder<br>
128 and audio decoder 129, respectively, and subsequently output to a<br>
18<br><br>
video-audio apparatus, such as a TV (S208) . During the playback of the<br>
content, the decryption of the protected content data 113 (S207) is<br>
performed in parallel.<br>
[0041]<br>
At the completion of reading all the protected content data 113<br>
corresponding to the content requested by the user, the content playback<br>
process ends (S206).<br>
Thus concludes the description of the content playback process.<br>
Note that the procedure of the content playback process shown<br>
here is merely one example; the present invention is not limited to this.<br>
[0042]<br>
Bytecode Execution Process<br>
The bytecode 112 stored in the recording medium 101 includes an<br>
anomalous-apparatus table listing therein (i) apparatus unique<br>
information of, for example, apparatuses where bugs have been found,<br>
apparatuses that have been identified as unauthorized, and/or emulators<br>
(all of such apparatuses are hereinafter referred to as "anomalous<br>
apparatus") and (ii) messages to these apparatuses.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an example of the anomalous-apparatus table. As<br>
shown in FIG. 3, the apparatus unique information is information unique<br>
to each content playback apparatus 102, and is composed of, for example,<br>
an apparatus maker ID, a model number of the playback apparatus, a<br>
manufacturing serial number of the playback apparatus, and a version<br>
number of playback process firmware of the playback apparatus. As to<br>
the messages, besides messages informing the user that the playback<br>
process cannot be carried out, messages can also be set that indicate<br>
reasons for why the playback process cannot be performed and how to deal<br>
with the problems (e.g. directing the user to update the firmware).<br>
19<br><br>
[0043]<br>
The bytecode 112 stored in the recording medium 101 further<br>
includes: an acquisition step of acquiring apparatus unique information<br>
from the apparatus unique information storage unit 133 of the content<br>
playback apparatus 102; a judging step of judging whether the acquired<br>
apparatus unique information is included in the anomalous-apparatus<br>
table described above; and a display request step of, when the acquired<br>
apparatus unique information is judged, in the judging step, to be<br>
included in the anomalous-apparatus table, requesting the content<br>
playback apparatus 102 to display a message for the apparatus, which is<br>
set in the anomalous-apparatus table.<br>
[0044]<br>
The following describes the bytecode execution process with<br>
reference to FIG. 4. Note that this process is the detail of S201 in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124 reads the bytecode 112 from the<br>
recording medium 101 (S401).<br>
Next, the bytecode execution unit 124 acquires apparatus unique<br>
information from the apparatus unique information storage unit 133 of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102 (S402). Here, the apparatus unique<br>
information is information unique to each content playback apparatus 102,<br>
and is composed of, for example, an apparatus maker ID, a model number<br>
of the playback apparatus, a manufacturing serial number of the playback<br>
apparatus, and a version number of playback process firmware of the<br>
playback apparatus. Individual apparatus unique information is assigned<br>
to each content playback apparatus 102. That is, with apparatus unique<br>
information, each content playback apparatus 102 can be identified.<br>
[0045]<br>
20<br><br>
Next, the bytecode is started (S403).<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124 executes the acquired bytecode<br>
112 to thereby judge whether the apparatus unique information acquired<br>
in S402 is included in the anomalous-apparatus table (S404) .<br>
In the case of FIG. 3, if the apparatus unique information<br>
acquired in S402 matches the apparatus unique information of (1) in the<br>
anomalous-apparatus table of FIG. 3-i.e. if the apparatus unique<br>
information acquired in S402 includes "APPARATUS MAKER ID = A", a<br>
request for displaying the message of (1) is made.<br>
[0046]<br>
Then, when judging in S404 that the apparatus unique information<br>
is included in the anomalous-apparatus table, the bytecode execution<br>
unit 124 transmits a request for displaying a message aimed for the<br>
apparatus together with the message to the display control unit 134 of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102; when judging that the apparatus<br>
unique information is not included in the anomalous-apparatus table, the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124 refrains from transmitting the request for<br>
displaying a message aimed for the apparatus (S405).<br>
Next, when receiving a request for displaying a message from the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124, the display control unit 134 of the content<br>
playback apparatus 102 indicates the display unit 135 to display the<br>
message and ends the content playback process (S406) . The display unit<br>
135 displays the message (S407).<br>
[0047]<br>
On the other hand, when not receiving a request for displaying a<br>
message from the bytecode execution unit 124, the display control unit<br>
134 of the content playback apparatus 102 carries on the content<br>
playback process (to S202).<br>
21<br><br>
It is a copyright holder of the content that selects the bytecode<br>
112 to be stored in the recording medium 101. Thereby, the copyright<br>
holder is capable of having control of displaying a specified message<br>
aimed for a specific content playback apparatus having a problem.<br>
[0048]<br>
Thus concludes the description of the bytecode execution process.<br>
Revocation Confirmation Process of Content Playback Apparatus 102<br>
The following describes the revocation confirmation process of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102 with reference to FIG. 5. Note that<br>
this process is the detail of S202 in FIG. 2.<br>
The. revocation confirmation process is a process performed before<br>
the content playback for checking, based on the revocation information<br>
recorded on the recording medium 101, whether the content playback<br>
apparatus 102 has been revoked.<br>
[0049]<br>
The revocation information processing unit 131 reads the device<br>
key acquired from the device key storage unit 132 (S501) . The device<br>
key is information unique to each content playback apparatus, therefore<br>
being capable of identifying a particular content playback apparatus 102.<br>
Next, the revocation information processing unit 131 reads the<br>
revocation information 115 stored in the recording medium 101 (S502) ,<br>
and generates a media key using the read device key and revocation<br>
information 115 (S503).<br>
[0050]<br>
In the case where the content playback apparatus 102 has been<br>
revoked, a media key cannot be generated. The generation of the media<br>
key using the device key and revocation information 115 is described in<br>
detail in "National Technical Report, Volume 43, Number 3, pp. 118-122<br>
22<br><br>
("Gijyutsu Somu" (technological general administration) Center,<br>
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., issued on June 18, 1997).<br>
Thus concludes the description of the revocation confirmation<br>
process of the content playback apparatus 102.<br>
[0051]<br>
Content Key Generation Process<br>
The following describes the content key generation process with<br>
reference to FIG. 6. Note that this process is the detail of S204 in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
The content key generation unit 130 acquires the media key<br>
generated in S202 from the revocation information processing unit 131<br>
(S601) . Next, the content key generation unit 130 reads the encrypted<br>
content key 114 from the recording medium 101, and decrypts the<br>
encrypted content key 114 using the media key acquired in S401 (S602) .<br>
AES is used for encrypting and decrypting the content key; however, the<br>
present invention is not limited to this.<br>
[0052]<br>
Thus concludes the description of the content key generation<br>
process.<br>
EMBODIMENT 2<br>
FIG. 7 shows structures of a recording medium 101A and a content<br>
playback apparatus 102A of one embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
following describes the present embodiment, focusing on its differences<br>
from Embodiment 1.<br>
On the recording medium 101A, a bytecode 112A, protected content<br>
data 113A, an encrypted content key 114A, and revocation information<br>
115A are recorded. As the recording medium 101A, exactly the same<br>
recording medium as that of Embodiment 1 can be used, and the detailed<br>
23<br><br>
explanation for the recording medium 101A is therefore not given here.<br>
As to data recorded on the recording medium 101A, it is essentially the<br>
same as that of Embodiment 1, except for details of the content of the<br>
bytecode, and the detailed explanation for the recorded data is<br>
therefore omitted here. Note that the details of the content of the<br>
bytecode are described later.<br>
[0053]<br>
The content playback apparatus 102A comprises: a disk reading<br>
unit 121A; a playback control unit 122A; a user operation reception unit<br>
123A; a bytecode execution unit 124A; a decryption unit 125A; a<br>
demultiplexing unit 127A; a video decoder 128A; an audio decoder 129A; a<br>
content key generation unit 130A; a revocation information processing<br>
unit 131A; a device key storage unit 132A; a display control unit 134A;<br>
a display unit 135A; and an apparatus state information acquisition unit<br>
13 6A.<br>
[0054]<br>
A computer system composed of a CPU, a work memory, a flash<br>
memory, a BD drive and a remote controller is a practical embodiment of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102A. The disk reading unit 121A is the<br>
BD drive,- the device key storage unit 132A is the flash memory; and the<br>
user operation reception unit 123A is a remote controller. The playback<br>
control unit 122A, bytecode execution unit 124A, decryption unit 125A,<br>
demultiplexing unit 127A, video decoder 128A, audio decoder 129A,<br>
content key generation unit 130A, revocation information processing unit<br>
131A, display control unit 134A, display unit 135A, and apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 13 6A can be configured by software<br>
operating with the use of the CPU and work memory; however, these units<br>
24<br><br>
can be realized by hardware implementation, and the present invention is<br>
not limited to the software implementation.<br>
[0055]<br>
Thus concludes the descriptions on the structures of. the<br>
recording medium and the content playback apparatus of one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Content Playback Process<br>
The following describes a content playback process with reference<br>
to FIG. 8.<br>
First, the content playback process starts when a user's request<br>
for content playback start is received at the user operation reception<br>
unit 123A.<br>
[0056]<br>
When the user operation reception unit 123A receives a content<br>
playback request, the content playback apparatus 102A reads the bytecode<br>
112A from the recording medium 101A, and the bytecode 112A is started by<br>
the bytecode execution unit 124A (Step S201A) . The detailed description<br>
of the process performed by the bytecode execution unit 124A is given<br>
later.<br>
The revocation information processing unit 131A performs the<br>
revocation confirmation process of the content playback apparatus 102A<br>
(S202A) . The detail of the revocation confirmation process is described<br>
later.<br>
[0057]<br>
The subsequent process branches depending on whether the<br>
generation of the media key in the revocation confirmation process S202A<br>
is successful or not (S203A) .<br>
25<br><br>
When the generation of the media key in the revocation<br>
confirmation process S202A is successful, the content playback apparatus<br>
102A reads the encrypted content key 114A from the recording medium 101A<br>
and generates a content key (S204A) . The detail ..of the content key<br>
generation is described later.<br>
[0058]<br>
If the generation of the media key in the revocation confirmation<br>
process S202A fails, apparatus state information (1A) indicating revoked<br>
state due to the failure in the acquisition of the media key is notified<br>
to the apparatus state information acquisition unit 13 6A as apparatus<br>
state information. When notified of the apparatus state information<br>
(1A) , the apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A notifies the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A of the apparatus state information (1A)<br>
(S209A) . The process performed by the bytecode execution unit 124A<br>
after the notification of the apparatus state information (1A) is<br>
described later.<br>
[0059]<br>
After the completion of S204A, in order to play back a content<br>
requested by the user, the playback control unit 122A instructs a start<br>
of reading the protected content data 113A, which is to be a playback<br>
target, in accordance with the playback control information 111A (S205A).<br>
Until all the protected content data 113A is read, the following<br>
process is repeated (S206A) .<br>
[0060]<br>
Using the content key generated by the content key generation<br>
unit 130A, the decryption unit 125A performs a decryption process on the<br>
protected content data 113A read from the recording medium 101A (S207A) .<br>
26<br><br>
At this point, if the decryption is not properly performed for<br>
some reason (for example, a right content key was not generated by the<br>
content key generation unit 13OA) , apparatus state information (2A)<br>
indicating decryption anomalous state due to the failure in the<br>
acquisition of the content key is notified to the apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A as apparatus state information. When<br>
notified of the apparatus state information (2A) , the apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A notifies the bytecode execution unit<br>
124A of the apparatus state information (2A) (S209A) . The process<br>
performed by the bytecode execution unit 124A after the notification of<br>
the apparatus state information (2A) is described later.<br>
[0061]<br>
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for the encryption of<br>
the protected content data 113A; however, the present invention is not<br>
limited to this. The decrypted content data is MPEG2-TS data in plain<br>
text, which is then demultiplexed into video and audio streams by the<br>
demultiplexing unit 127A. These video and audio streams are sent to the<br>
video decoder 12 8A and audio decoder 12 9A, respectively, and<br>
subsequently output to a video-audio apparatus, such as a TV (S208A) .<br>
[0062]<br>
During the playback of the content, the decryption of the<br>
protected content data 113A (S207A) is performed in parallel.<br>
At the completion of reading all the protected content data 113A<br>
corresponding to the content requested by the user, the content playback<br>
process ends (S206A) .<br>
Thus concludes the description of the content playback process.<br>
[0063]<br>
27<br><br>
Note that the procedure of the content playback process shown<br>
here is merely one example; the present invention is not limited to this.<br>
ByteCode Execution Process<br>
The bytecode stored in the recording medium includes an<br>
anomalous-state table listing therein apparatus state information and<br>
messages for respective apparatus states.<br>
[0064]<br>
FIG. 9 shows an example of the anomalous-state table. As shown in<br>
FIG. 9, the apparatus state information includes: apparatus state<br>
information (1A) indicating revoked state due to failure in acquisition<br>
of the media key; apparatus state information (IB) indicating revoked<br>
state due to other failure-i.e. anomaly in acquisition of information<br>
that indicates it is a legitimate playback apparatus; apparatus state<br>
information (2A) indicating decryption anomalous state due to anomaly in<br>
acquisition of the content key; and apparatus state information (2B)<br>
indicating decryption anomalous state due to other failure-i.e. anomaly<br>
in acquisition of information required for content playback. In the<br>
anomalous-state table, messages can be set that inform the user of the<br>
state of the playback apparatus and/or what action for playback should<br>
be taken.<br>
[0065]<br>
The bytecode 112A stored in the recording medium 101A further<br>
includes: an acquisition step of acquiring apparatus state information<br>
from the apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A of the<br>
content playback apparatus 102A; a judging step of judging whether the<br>
acquired apparatus state information is included in the anomalous-state<br>
table described above; and a display request step of, when the acquired<br>
apparatus state information is judged, in the judging step, to be<br>
28<br><br>
included in the anomalous-state table, requesting the content playback<br>
apparatus 102A to display a message for the state of the apparatus,<br>
which is set in the anomalous-state table.<br>
[0066]<br>
The following describes the bytecode startup process with<br>
reference to FIG. 10. Note that this process is the detail of S201A in<br>
FIG. 8.<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124A reads the bytecode 112A from the<br>
recording medium 101A (S401A) . Then, the bytecode execution unit 124A<br>
starts the bytecode 112A (S402A) .<br>
[0067]<br>
The following describes the bytecode execution process with<br>
reference to FIG. 11. Note that this process is the detail of S209A in<br>
FIG. 8.<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124A acquires apparatus state<br>
information from the apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A<br>
of the content playback apparatus 102A (S403A) .<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124A executes the acquired bytecode<br>
112A to thereby judge whether the apparatus state information acquired<br>
in S403A is included in the anomalous-state table (S404A) .<br>
[0068]<br>
In the case of FIG. 9, if the apparatus state information<br>
acquired in S403A matches the apparatus state information of (1) in the<br>
anomalous-state table of FIG. 9-i.e. if the apparatus state information<br>
acquired in S403A corresponds to (1A) "the revoked state due to failure<br>
in acquisition of the media key," a request for displaying the message<br>
of (1) is made.<br>
29<br><br>
Then, when judging in S404A that the apparatus state information<br>
is included in the anomalous-state table, the bytecode execution unit<br>
124A transmits a request for displaying a message for the state of the<br>
apparatus together with the message to the display control unit 134A of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102A; when judging that the apparatus<br>
state information is not included in the anomalous-state table, the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A refrains from transmitting the request for<br>
displaying a message for the state of the apparatus (S405A) .<br>
[0069]<br>
Next, when receiving a request for displaying a message from the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A, the display control unit 134A of the<br>
playback apparatus 102A indicates the display unit 135A to display the<br>
message and ends the content playback process (S406A) . The display unit<br>
135A displays the message (S407A) .<br>
On the other hand, when not receiving a request for displaying a<br>
message from the bytecode execution unit 124A, the display control unit<br>
134A of the content playback apparatus 102A carries on the content<br>
playback process (to S203A, S206A) .<br>
[0070]<br>
It is a copyright holder of the content that selects the bytecode<br>
112A to be stored in the recording medium 101A. Thereby, the copyright<br>
holder is capable of having control of displaying a predetermined<br>
message for a playback apparatus in specific anomalous state.<br>
Thus concludes the description of the bytecode execution process.<br>
Revocation Confirmation Process of Content Playback Apparatus<br>
102A<br>
30<br><br>
Since the revocation confirmation process of the content playback<br>
apparatus 102A is the same as that of the content playback apparatus 102<br>
of Embodiment 1, the description is omitted here.<br>
[0071]<br>
Content Key Generation Process<br>
Since the content key generation process is the same as that of<br>
Embodiment 1, the description is omitted here.<br>
Other Modifications<br>
The present invention has been described based on the above<br>
embodiments; it is however a matter of course that the present invention<br>
is not limited to these embodiments. The following cases are also<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0072]<br>
(1) Embodiment 1 has a structure that stops, when the playback<br>
apparatus is judged as an anomalous apparatus, the playback of the<br>
content and displays only a message; however, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this structure. For example, in the case where the user<br>
has no malicious intent-e.g. the playback apparatus has been<br>
manufactured by a manufacturer with malicious intent, or in the case<br>
where a message to be displayed is firmware update notification, a<br>
message may be displayed over the content being played back in the case<br>
when the playback apparatus is judged as an anomalous apparatus.<br>
Alternatively, the bytecode may be made to also include control<br>
information that indicates whether to stop the content playback or to<br>
display a message over the content being played back, and the playback<br>
apparatus switches, based on the control information, between stopping<br>
the content playback and displaying a message over the content being<br>
played back.<br>
31<br><br>
[0073]<br>
Similarly, Embodiment 2 has a structure that stops, when the<br>
playback apparatus is judged as an anomalous state, the playback of the<br>
content and displays only a message; however, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this structure. For example, in the case where the user<br>
has no malicious intent, a message may be displayed over the content<br>
being played back in the case when the playback apparatus is judged as<br>
being in anomalous state. Alternatively, the bytecode may be made to<br>
also include control information that indicates whether to stop the<br>
content playback or to display a message over the content being played<br>
back, and the playback apparatus switches, based on the control<br>
information, between stopping the content playback and displaying a<br>
message over the content being played back.<br>
[0074]<br>
(2) Embodiment 1 has a structure in which the judgment of<br>
whether an anomalous apparatus or not is made based on the apparatus<br>
unique information and a message is displayed accordingly; however, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the apparatus unique information.<br>
Also, Embodiment 2 has a structure in which the judgment of<br>
whether anomalous state or not is made based on the apparatus state<br>
information and a message is displayed accordingly; however, the present<br>
invention is not limited to the apparatus state information.<br>
For example, the bytecode may be structured in such a way as to<br>
request the playback apparatus to display a predetermined message if<br>
other information received from the playback apparatus-e.g. content<br>
associated information (including license information) and/or user<br>
information (including user input information)-satisfies a<br>
predetermined condition. This structure produces an effect that the<br>
32<br><br>
message to be displayed can be dynamically changed according to the<br>
absence or presence of the license information of the content and<br>
attributes of the user.<br>
[0075]<br>
(3)	Embodiment 2 has a structure in which an appropriate message<br>
is displayed in the case where acquisition of the media key is failed;<br>
however, the present invention is not limited to this structure. For<br>
example, an appropriate message may be displayed in the case where<br>
acquisition of another information indicating that it is a compliant<br>
playback apparatus is failed (the case of the apparatus state<br>
information (IB) of FIG. 9).<br>
Also, Embodiment 2 has a structure in which an appropriate<br>
message is displayed in the case where generation of the decrypted data<br>
is failed; however, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
structure. For example, in the case where the protected content has<br>
been generated by performing some conversion process on the content and<br>
then encrypting the converted content with the use of a content key, the<br>
decryption unit 125A of the playback apparatus first decrypts the<br>
protected content using the content key, and then an inverse conversion<br>
process which is inverse to the above conversion process is performed<br>
the decrypted content. In this case, an appropriate message may be<br>
displayed if the inverse conversion process is not properly performed<br>
due to failure in acquisition of information necessary for the inverse<br>
conversion process (the case of the apparatus state information (2B) of<br>
FIG. 9).<br>

(8) The present invention includes a structure in which two or<br>
more of the above embodiments and modifications are combined.<br><additional particulars><br>
(1) Structure of Recording Medium 101<br>
35<br><br>
The following presents a supplementary description of the<br>
structure of the recording medium 101 of Embodiment 1.<br>
[0082]<br>
The recording medium 101 includes, as shown in FIG. 1: the<br>
playback control information 111; the bytecode 112; the protected<br>
content data 113; the encrypted content key 114; and the revocation<br>
information 115.<br>
(1.1) Bytecode 112<br>
The bytecode 112 includes, for example, a JAVA (registered<br>
trademark) byte code, and an executable code composed of fixed-length<br>
instruction sets.<br>
[0083]<br>
As described above, the bytecode 112 includes: an anomalous-<br>
apparatus table shown in FIG. 3; an acquisition step of acquiring<br>
apparatus unique information from the apparatus unique information<br>
storage unit 133 of the content playback apparatus 102; a judging step<br>
of judging whether the acquired apparatus unique information is included<br>
in the anomalous-apparatus table described above; and a display request<br>
step of, when the acquired apparatus unique information is judged, in<br>
the judging step, to be included in the anomalous-apparatus table,<br>
requesting the content playback apparatus 102 to display a message for<br>
the apparatus, which is set in the anomalous-apparatus table.<br>
[0084]<br>
Here, the acquisition step acquires apparatus unique information<br>
by interacting the content playback apparatus 102. Note that<br>
"interacting the content playback apparatus 102" means information<br>
interaction between the bytecode 112 and a program different from the<br>
bytecode 112 executed by the bytecode execution unit 124 of the content<br>
36<br><br>
playback apparatus 102-e.g. a program including Steps S401-403, 406,<br>
and 407 of FIG. 4.<br>
[0085]<br>
(1.2)	Protected Content Data 113<br>
The protected content data 113 is data created by performing,<br>
with the use of a content key, an encryption process on MPEG2-TS data in<br>
plain-text which is able to output video using a decoder. An encryption<br>
method used here is secret key cryptography.<br>
(1.3)	Encrypted Content Key 114<br>
The encrypted content key 114 is data created by, with the use of<br>
a media key, encrypting the content key used for decrypting the<br>
protected content data. An encryption method used here is secret key<br>
cryptography.<br>
[0086]<br>
(1.4)	Revocation Information 115<br>
The revocation information 115 is, as described above, a list<br>
itemizing encrypted media keys, each of which corresponds to a device<br>
key assigned to an individual content playback apparatus, and key ID<br>
numbers.<br>
Here, encrypted media keys and key ID numbers corresponding to<br>
device keys assigned to revoked content playback apparatuses have been<br>
removed from the list.<br>
[0087]<br>
Herewith, only a legitimate content playback apparatus (i.e. a<br>
content playback apparatus having not been revoked) is capable of<br>
decrypting the encrypted media key using the revocation information 115<br>
and the device key assigned to the apparatus and acquiring the media key.<br>
37<br><br>
An encryption method used here is secret key cryptography. FIG.<br>
12 shows a specific example of the revocation information 115.<br>
[0088]<br>
Here, device keys are denoted as DK1, DK2, ..., and DKn; key IDs as<br>
Kl, K2, ..., and Kn; and a media key as MK. Enc(x, y) means information<br>
generated by encrypting "y" using secret key cryptography and "x".<br>
In FIG. 12, a content playback apparatus to which a key 3D "K3"<br>
has been assigned has been revoked. A content playback apparatus to<br>
which a key ID "Kl" is a legitimate apparatus (i.e. unrevoked apparatus),<br>
and therefore is able to decrypt an encrypted media key "Enc (DK1, MK)"<br>
using the device key "DK1" corresponding to the key ID "Kl" .<br>
[0089]<br>
(1.5) Playback Control Information 111<br>
The playback control information 111 is information specifying a<br>
playback order of the protected content data 113 for the time when the<br>
content is played back.<br>
(2) Structure of Content Playback Apparatus 102<br>

that manufactured the content playback apparatus 102.<br>
The model number is a number for identifying a type of the<br>
content playback apparatus 102 among one or more types of content<br>
playback apparatuses manufactured by the maker identified by the<br>
apparatus maker ID.<br>
The manufacturing serial number is a number for identifying each<br>
of one or more content playback apparatuses having the same model number.<br>
[0093]<br>
The firm version number is a number indicating a version of the<br>
playback process firmware incorporated in the content playback apparatus<br>
102.<br>
(2.2)	Device Key Storage Unit 132<br>
The device key storage unit 132 stores a device key assigned to<br>
the content playback apparatus 102 and a key ID number.<br>
[0094]<br>
(2.3)	User Operation Reception Unit 123<br>
39<br><br>
The user operation reception unit 123 receives a request for<br>
starting the content playback (a content playback start request) from<br>
the user, and outputs the received content playback start request to the<br>
playback control unit 122.<br>
(2.4) Playback Control Unit 122<br>
The playback control unit 122 controls the content playback.<br>
[0095]<br>
When receiving a content playback start request from the user<br>
operation reception unit 123, the playback control unit 122 outputs, to<br>
the bytecode execution unit 124, a bytecode execution instruction that<br>
instructs execution of the bytecode.<br>
When receiving, from the bytecode execution unit 124, a playback<br>
continuation instruction that instructs continuation of the content<br>
playback, the playback control unit 122 outputs, to the revocation<br>
information processing unit 131, a revocation check instruction that<br>
instructs to check whether the content playback apparatus 102 has been<br>
revoked or not.<br>
[0096]<br>
When receiving, from the display control unit 134, a playback<br>
prohibition instruction indicating that the content playback is not<br>
allowed, the playback control unit 122 ends the content playback. This<br>
operation corresponds to the playback inhibiting unit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
When receiving, from the revocation information processing unit<br>
131, an apparatus revocation instruction indicating that the content<br>
playback apparatus 102 has been revoked, the playback control unit 122<br>
ends the content playback.<br>
[0097]<br>
40<br><br>
When receiving, from the decryption unit 125, a playback abort<br>
instruction indicating to abort the content playback, the playback<br>
control unit 122 aborts the content playback.<br>
(2.5) Bytecode Execution Unit 124<br>
When receiving a bytecode execution instruction from the playback<br>
control unit 122, the bytecode execution unit 124 reads the bytecode 112<br>
from the recording medium 101 via the disk reading unit 121. This<br>
operation corresponds to the reading unit of the present invention.<br>
[0098]<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124 acquires the apparatus maker ID,<br>
model number, manufacturing serial number, and firm version number<br>
stored in the apparatus unique information storage unit 133.<br>
Hereinafter, a set of the apparatus maker ID, model number,<br>
manufacturing serial number, and firm version number is referred to as<br>
apparatus unique information.<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124 starts the read bytecode 112, and<br>
thereby checks whether the content playback apparatus 102 is an<br>
anomalous apparatus or not. At this point, the bytecode execution unit<br>
124 interacts with the bytecode 112 in execution, and whereby notifies<br>
the bytecode 112 of the acquired apparatus unique information. Note<br>
that "interacts with the bytecode 112" means information interaction<br>
between the bytecode 112 and a program different from the bytecode 112<br>
executed by the bytecode execution unit 124-e.g. a program including<br>
Steps S401-403, 406, and 407 of FIG. 4, as described above. Here, the<br>
operation that the content playback apparatus starts the bytecode 112<br>
corresponds to the startup unit of the present invention. Also, the<br>
operation that the content playback apparatus 102 interacts with the<br>
bytecode 112 and thereby notifies the bytecode 112 of the apparatus<br>
41<br><br>
unique information corresponds to the interaction unit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0099]<br>
When receiving a display request for a message from the bytecode<br>
112 and a message determined in the bytecode 112, the bytecode execution<br>
unit 124 outputs the received display request and message to the display<br>
control unit 134.<br>
When not receiving a display request and a message from the<br>
bytecode 112, the bytecode execution unit 124 outputs a playback<br>
continuation instruction to the playback control unit 122.<br>
[0100]<br>
(2.6)	Display Control Unit 134<br>
When receiving a display request and a message from the bytecode<br>
execution unit 124, the display control unit 134 outputs a playback<br>
prohibition instruction to the playback control unit 122.<br>
The display control unit 134 displays the received message on the<br>
monitor via the display unit 135.<br>
[0101]<br>
(2.7)	Display Unit 135<br>
The display unit 135 displays, on the monitor, a message received<br>
from the display control unit 134. The operation of the display unit<br>
135 corresponds to an example of the processing unit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
(2.8)	Revocation Information Processing Unit 131<br>
When receiving a revocation check instruction from the playback<br>
control unit 122, the revocation information processing unit 131<br>
acquires the device key and key ID number from the device key storage<br>
unit 132.<br>
42<br><br>
[0102]<br>
The revocation information processing unit 131 reads the<br>
revocation information 115 from the recording medium 101 via the disk<br>
reading unit 121, and checks, using the read revocation information 115<br>
and the acquired key ID number, whether the content playback apparatus<br>
102 has been revoked.<br>
When judging that it has been revoked, the revocation information<br>
processing unit 131 outputs an apparatus revocation instruction to the<br>
playback control unit 122.<br>
[0103]<br>
When judging that it has not been revoked, the revocation<br>
information processing unit 131 generates a media key by decrypting the<br>
encrypted media key using the read revocation information 115 and the<br>
acquired device key and key ID number. The revocation information<br>
processing unit 131 outputs the generated media key to the content key<br>
generation unit 130.<br>
(2.9)	Content Key Generation Unit 130<br>
When receiving a media key from the revocation information<br>
processing unit 131, the content key generation unit 130 reads the<br>
encrypted content key 114 from the recording medium 101 via the disk<br>
reading unit 121.<br>
[0104]<br>
The content key generation unit 130 decrypts the read encrypted<br>
content key using the media key to thereby generate a content key.<br>
The content key generation unit 130 outputs the generated content<br>
key to the decryption unit 125.<br>
(2.10)	Decryption Unit 125<br>
43<br><br>
When receiving a content key from the content key generation unit<br>
130, the decryption unit 125 sequentially reads the protected content<br>
data 113 from the recording medium 101 via the disk reading unit 121,<br>
based on the playback control information 111.<br>
[0105]<br>
The decryption unit 125 decrypts the read protected content data<br>
113 using the content key, generates content data, and outputs the<br>
generated content data to the demultiplexing unit 127.<br>
When reading of all protected content data to be played back is<br>
completed, the decryption unit 125 outputs a playback end instruction to<br>
the playback control unit 122.<br>
[0106]<br>
(2.11)	Demultiplexing Unit 127<br>
When receiving content data from the decryption unit 125, the<br>
demultiplexing unit 127 demultiplex the content data into video and<br>
audio streams, and outputs the video stream to the video decoder 128 and<br>
the audio stream to the audio decoder 129.<br>
(2.12)	Video Decoder 128<br>
When receiving a video stream from the demultiplexing unit 127,<br>
the video decoder 128 decodes the received video stream to thereby<br>
generate video data, and outputs the generated video data to the monitor.<br>
[0107]<br>
(2.13)	Audio Decoder 129<br>
When receiving an audio stream from the demultiplexing unit 127,<br>
the audio decoder 129 decodes the received audio stream to thereby<br>
generate audio data, and outputs the generated audio data to the<br>
speakers.<br>
(2.14) Disk Reading Unit 121<br>
44<br><br>
The disk reading unit 121 is able to access the recording medium<br>
101, and reads data recorded on the recording medium 101.<br>
[0108]<br>
(3) Operation of Content Playback Apparatus 102<br>
The following presents a supplementary description of the<br>
bytecode execution process shown in FIG. 4.<br>
(3.1)	Details of Step S404<br>
Detailed operations of Step S404 shown in FIG. 4 are described<br>
with the use of the flowchart of FIG. 13.<br>
[0109]<br>
The bytecode 112 acquires apparatus unique information by<br>
interacting with the content playback apparatus 102 (Step S500). This<br>
operation corresponds to the acquisition step included in the bytecode<br>
112. At this point, the bytecode execution unit 124 notifies the<br>
acquired apparatus unique information to the bytecode 112. Here, the<br>
interaction between the bytecode 112 and the content playback apparatus<br>
102 means information interaction between the bytecode 112 and a program<br>
different from the bytecode 112 executed by the bytecode execution unit<br>
124-e.g. a program including Steps S401-403, 406, and 407 of FIG. 4, as<br>
described above. At this point also, the content playback apparatus 102<br>
notifies the apparatus unique information to the bytecode 112 by the<br>
interaction, and this operation corresponds to the interaction step of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0110]<br>
The bytecode 112 searches the anomalous-apparatus table for a<br>
message corresponding to the acquired apparatus unique information (Step<br>
S505).<br>
(3.2)	Details of Step S405<br>
45<br><br>
Detailed operations of Step S405 shown in FIG. 4 are described<br>
with the use of the flowchart of FIG. 14.<br>
[0111]<br>
According to the result of the search of Step S505, the bytecode<br>
112 judges whether the message is present (Step S550). This operation<br>
corresponds to the judging step included in the bytecode 112. Note that<br>
the operation composed of Steps S505 and S550 may be the judging step,<br>
instead.<br>
When determining that the message is present ("YES" in Step S550),<br>
the bytecode 112 acquires the message corresponding to the acquired<br>
apparatus unique information (Step S555). The bytecode 112 outputs the<br>
acquired message and a display request to the bytecode execution unit<br>
124 of the content playback apparatus 102 (Step S560). This operation<br>
corresponds to the display request step included in the bytecode 112.<br>
Note that the operation composed of Steps S555 and S560 may be the<br>
display request step, instead.<br>
[0112]<br>
When determining that the message is absent ("NO" in Step S550) ,<br>
the bytecode 112 ends the process, and thereby the bytecode execution<br>
unit 124 of the content playback apparatus 102 outputs a playback<br>
continuation instruction to the playback control unit 122. Herewith,<br>
the content playback apparatus 102 moves to Step S202.<br>
As to operations after Step S560, when receiving a message and a<br>
display request from the bytecode 112, the bytecode execution unit 124<br>
of the content playback apparatus 102 outputs the received message and<br>
display request to the display control unit 134. Herewith, the content<br>
playback apparatus performs Step S406 and the subsequent process.<br>
[0113]<br>
46<br><br>
(4) Structure of Recording Medium 101A<br>
The following presents a supplementary description of the<br>
structure of the recording medium 101A of Embodiment 2.<br>
The recording medium 101A includes, as shown in FIG. 7: the<br>
playback control information 111A; the bytecode 112A; the protected<br>
content data 113A; the encrypted content key 114A; and the revocation<br>
information 115A.<br>
[0114]<br>
The playback control information 111A, protected content data<br>
113A, encrypted content key 114A, and revocation information 115A are<br>
the same as the playback control information 111, protected content data<br>
113, encrypted content key 114, and revocation information 115,<br>
respectively, and therefore, their descriptions are omitted here.<br>
The following explains the bytecode 112A.<br>
[0115]<br>
As described above, the bytecode 112A stored in the recording<br>
medium 101A includes: an anomalous-state table shown in FIG. 9; an<br>
acquisition step of acquiring apparatus state information from the<br>
apparatus state information acquisition unit 13 6A of the content<br>
playback apparatus 102A; a judging step of judging whether the acquired<br>
apparatus state information is included in the anomalous-state table<br>
described above; and a display request step of, when in the judging step<br>
the acquired apparatus state information is judged to be included in the<br>
anomalous-state table, requesting the content playback apparatus 102A to<br>
display a message for the state of the apparatus which is set in the<br>
anomalous-state table.<br>
[0116]<br>
47<br><br>
Here, the acquisition step acquires apparatus state information<br>
by interacting the content playback apparatus 102A. Note that<br>
"interacting the content playback apparatus 102A" means information<br>
interaction between the bytecode 112A and a program different from the<br>
bytecode 112A executed by the bytecode execution unit 124A of the<br>
content playback apparatus 102A-e.g. a program including Steps 403A,<br>
406A, and 407A of FIG. 11.<br>

(5) Content Playback Apparatus 102A<br>
The content playback apparatus 102A, as shown in FIG. 7,<br>
comprises: a disk reading unit 121A; a playback control unit 122A; a<br>
user operation reception unit 123A; a bytecode execution unit 124A; a<br>
decryption unit 125A; a demultiplexing unit 127A; a video decoder 128A;<br>
an audio decoder 129A; a content key generation unit 130A; a revocation<br>
information processing unit 131A; a device key storage unit 132A; a<br>
display control unit 134A; a display unit 135A; and an apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A.<br>
[0118]<br>
(5.1)	Device Key Storage Unit 132A<br>
Since the device key storage unit 13 2A is the same as the device<br>
key storage unit 132, the description is omitted here.<br>
(5.2)	User Operation Reception Unit 123A<br>
Since the user operation reception unit 123A is the same as the<br>
user operation reception unit 123, the description is omitted here.<br>
[0119]<br>
(5.3)	Playback Control Unit 122A<br>
The playback control unit 122A controls the content playback.<br>
48<br><br>
When receiving a content playback start request from the user<br>
operation reception unit 123A, the playback control unit 122A outputs,<br>
to the bytecode execution unit 124A, a bytecode startup instruction that<br>
instructs startup of the bytecode.<br>
[0120]<br>
When receiving a startup completion instruction that indicates<br>
completion of startup of the bytecode 112A, the playback control unit<br>
122A outputs, to the revocation information processing unit 131A, a<br>
revocation check instruction that instructs to check whether the content<br>
playback apparatus 102A has been revoked or not.<br>
When receiving, from the display control unit 134A, a playback<br>
canceling instruction indicating to cancel the content playback, the<br>
playback control unit 122A ends the content playback. This operation<br>
corresponds to the playback inhibiting unit of the present invention.<br>
[0121]<br>
When receiving a playback end instruction from the decryption<br>
unit 125A, the playback control unit 122A ends the content playback.<br>
(5.4) Apparatus state information Acquisition Unit 136A<br>
The apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A acquires,<br>
as apparatus state information, result of the process performed by the<br>
revocation information processing unit 131A. The apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A stores the acquired apparatus state<br>
information. The result of the process performed by the revocation<br>
information processing unit 131A is, for example, a code indicating<br>
whether the process ended normally, and also indicating, in the case<br>
where the process ended abnormally, the type of the trouble. "1A" and<br>
"IB" of FIG. 9 represent codes for abnormal ends.<br>
[0122]<br>
49<br><br>
The apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A acquires,<br>
as apparatus state information, result of the process performed by the<br>
decryption unit 125A. The apparatus state information acquisition unit<br>
136A stores the acquired apparatus state information. The result of the<br>
process performed by the revocation information processing unit 131A is,<br>
for example, a code indicating whether the process ended normally (an<br>
error code), and also indicating, in the case where the process ended<br>
abnormally, the type of the trouble. "2A" and "2B" of FIG. 9 represent<br>
codes for abnormal ends.<br>
[0123]<br>
Here, the apparatus state information acquisition unit 13 6A<br>
stores therein only the latest apparatus state information, discarding<br>
other apparatus state information. That is, when acquiring one piece of<br>
apparatus state information, the apparatus state information acquisition<br>
unit 136A deletes apparatus state information having been stored therein<br>
up to that point.<br>
(5.5) Bytecode Execution Unit 124A<br>
When receiving a bytecode execution instruction from the playback<br>
control unit 122A, the bytecode execution unit 124A reads the bytecode<br>
112 from the recording medium 101A via the disk reading unit 121A. This<br>
operation corresponds to the reading unit of the present invention.<br>
[0124]<br>
The bytecode execution unit 124A starts the read bytecode 112A.<br>
At this point, the bytecode 112A is in a state of waiting an input.<br>
When startup of the bytecode 112A is completed, the bytecode<br>
execution unit 124A outputs a startup completion instruction to the<br>
playback control unit 122A.<br>
50<br><br>
When receiving, from the revocation information processing unit<br>
131A, an apparatus revocation instruction indicating that the content<br>
playback apparatus 102A has been revoked, the bytecode execution unit<br>
124A acquires apparatus state information from the apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A. The bytecode execution unit 124A<br>
provides, as information, the acquired apparatus state information to<br>
the running bytecode 112A, and thereby checks whether the content<br>
playback apparatus 102A is in an anomalous state. At this point, the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A interacts with the bytecode 112A in<br>
execution, and whereby notifies the acquired apparatus state information<br>
to the bytecode 112A. Note that "interacts with the bytecode 112A"<br>
means information interaction between the bytecode 112A and a program<br>
different from the bytecode 112A executed by the bytecode execution unit<br>
124A of the content playback apparatus 102A-e.g. a program including<br>
Steps S403A, 406A, and 407A of FIG. 11, as described above. Here, the<br>
operation that the content playback apparatus starts the bytecode 112A<br>
corresponds to the startup unit of the present invention. Also, the<br>
operation that the content playback apparatus 102A interacts with the<br>
bytecode 112A and thereby notifies the apparatus state information to<br>
the bytecode 112A corresponds to the interaction unit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0125]<br>
Also, when receiving, from the decryption unit 125A a decryption<br>
failure instruction indicating that decryption of the protected content<br>
data has been failed, the bytecode execution unit 124A acquires<br>
apparatus state information from the apparatus state information<br>
acquisition unit 136A. The bytecode execution unit 124A provides, as<br>
information, the acquired apparatus state information to the running<br>
51<br><br>
bytecode 112A, and thereby checks whether the content playback apparatus<br>
102A is in an anomalous state.<br>
[0126]<br>
When receiving a display request for a message from the bytecode<br>
112A and a message determined in the bytecode 112, the bytecode<br>
execution unit 124A outputs the received display request and message to<br>
the display control unit 134A.<br>
When not receiving a display request and a message from the<br>
bytecode 112, the bytecode execution unit 124A outputs a process<br>
continuation instruction indicating to continue the process to a source<br>
that has output the instruction (i.e. the revocation information<br>
processing unit 131A or the decryption unit 125A).<br>
[0127]<br>
(5.6)	Display Control Unit 134A<br>
When receiving a display request and a message from the bytecode<br>
execution unit 124A, the display control unit 134A outputs a playback<br>
prohibition instruction to the playback control unit 122A.<br>
The display control unit 134A displays the received message on<br>
the monitor via the display unit 13 5A.<br>
[0128]<br>
(5.7)	Display Unit 135A<br>
The display unit 135A displays, on the monitor, a message<br>
received from the display control unit 134A. The operation of the<br>
display unit 135A corresponds to an example of the processing unit of<br>
the present invention.<br>
(5.8)	Revocation Information Processing Unit 131A<br>
When receiving a revocation check instruction from the playback<br>
control unit 122A, the revocation information processing unit 131A<br>
52<br><br>
acquires the device key and key ID number from the device key storage<br>
unit 132A.<br>
[0129]<br>
The revocation information processing unit 131A reads the<br>
revocation information 115A from the recording medium 101A via the disk<br>
reading unit 121A, and checks, using the read revocation information<br>
115A and the acquired key ID number, whether the content playback<br>
apparatus 102A has been revoked.<br>
When judging that it has been revoked, the revocation information<br>
processing unit 131 issues error code indicating the type of the trouble<br>
that led to the abnormal end, and outputs the issued error code to the<br>
apparatus state information acquisition unit 136A. The revocation<br>
information processing unit 131A outputs an apparatus revocation<br>
instruction to the bytecode execution unit 124A.<br>
[0130]<br>
When judging that it has not been revoked, the revocation<br>
information processing unit 131A issues a code indicating that the<br>
process has ended normally, and outputs the issued code to the apparatus<br>
state information acquisition unit 136A. The revocation information<br>
processing unit 131A decrypts the encrypted media key using the read<br>
revocation information 115A and the acquired device key and key ID<br>
number to generate a media key. The revocation information processing<br>
unit 131A outputs the generated media key to the content key generation<br>
unit 130A.<br>
[0131]<br>
When receiving a process continuation instruction from the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A, the revocation information processing unit<br>
131A continues the process.<br>
53<br><br>
(5.9)	Content Key Generation Unit 130A<br>
The content key generation unit 130A is the same as the content<br>
key generation unit 130, the description is omitted here.<br>
[0132]<br>
(5.10)	Decryption Unit 125A<br>
When receiving a content key from the content key generation unit<br>
130A, the decryption unit 125A sequentially reads the protected content<br>
data 113A from the recording medium 101A via the disk reading unit 121A,<br>
based on the playback control information 111A.<br>
The decryption unit 125A decrypts the read protected content data<br>
113A using the content key, generates content data, and outputs the<br>
generated content data to the demultiplexing unit 127A. Here, if<br>
failing decryption of the protected content data 113A, the decryption<br>
unit 125A outputs an appropriate error code to the apparatus state<br>
information acquisition unit 136A and outputs a decryption failure<br>
instruction to the bytecode execution unit 124A. When succeeding the<br>
decryption of the protected content data 113A, the decryption unit 125A<br>
outputs an appropriate code to the apparatus state information<br>
acquisition unit 136A and continue the process.<br>
[0133]<br>
When reading of all protected content data to be played back is<br>
completed, the decryption unit 125A outputs a playback end instruction<br>
to the playback control unit 122A.<br>
When receiving a process continuation instruction from the<br>
bytecode execution unit 124A, the decryption unit 125A continues the<br>
process.<br>
(5.11)	Demultiplexing Unit 127<br>
54<br><br>
Since the demultiplexing unit 12 7A is the same as the<br>
demultiplexing unit 127, the description is omitted here.<br>
[0134]<br>
(5.12)	Video Decoder 128A<br>
Since the video decoder 128A is the same as the video decoder 128,<br>
the description is omitted here.<br>
(5.13)	Audio Decoder 129A<br>
Since the audio decoder 12 9A is the same as the audio decoder 129,<br>
the description is omitted here.<br>
[0135]<br>
(5.14)	Disk Reading Unit 121A<br>
Since the demultiplexing unit 12 7A is the same as the<br>
demultiplexing unit 127, the description is omitted here.<br>
(6) Operation of Content Playback Apparatus 102A<br>
The following presents a supplementary description of the<br>
bytecode execution process shown in FIG. 11.<br>
[0136]<br>
(6.1) Details of Step S404A<br>
Detailed operations of Step S404 shown in FIG. 11 are described<br>
with the use of the flowchart of FIG. 15.<br>
The bytecode 112A acquires apparatus state information by<br>
interacting with the content playback apparatus 102A (Step S500A) . This<br>
operation corresponds to the acquisition step included in the bytecode<br>
112A. At this point, the bytecode execution unit 124A notifies the<br>
acquired apparatus state information to the bytecode 112A. Here, the<br>
interaction between the bytecode 112A and the content playback apparatus<br>
102A means information interaction between the bytecode 112A and a<br>
program different from the bytecode 112A executed by the bytecode<br>
55<br><br>
execution unit 124A-e.g. a program including Steps S403A, 406A, and<br>
407A of FIG. 11, as described above. At this point also, the content<br>
playback apparatus 102A notifies the apparatus state information to the<br>
bytecode 112A by the interaction, and this operation corresponds to the<br>
interaction step of the present invention.<br>
[0137]<br>
The bytecode 112A searches the anomalous-state table for a<br>
message corresponding to the acquired apparatus state information (Step<br>
S505A) .<br>
(6.2) Details of Step S405A<br>
Detailed operations of Step S405A shown in FIG. 11 are described<br>
with the use of the flowchart of FIG. 16.<br>
[0138]<br>
According to the result of the search of Step S505A, the bytecode<br>
112A judges whether the message is present (Step S550A) . This operation<br>
corresponds to the judging step included in the bytecode 112A. Note<br>
that the operation composed of Steps S505A and S550A may be the judging<br>
step, instead.<br>
When determining that the message is present ("YES" in Step<br>
S550A) , the bytecode 112A acquires the message corresponding to the<br>
acquired apparatus state information (Step S555A) . The bytecode 112A<br>
outputs the acquired message and a display request to the bytecode<br>
execution unit 124A of the content playback apparatus 102A (Step S560A) .<br>
This operation corresponds to the display request step included in the<br>
bytecode 112A. Note that the operation composed of Steps S555A and<br>
S560A may be the display request step, instead.<br>
[0139]<br>
56<br><br>
When determining that the message is absent ("NO" in Step S550A),<br>
the bytecode 112A ends the process. The byteccde execution unit 124A of<br>
the content playback apparatus 102A then outputs a process continuation<br>
instruction indicating continuation of the process to a source of<br>
calling the bytecode execution process (i.e. the revocation information<br>
processing unit 131A or the decryption unit 125A). Herewith, the<br>
content playback apparatus 102 moves to Step S203A or Step S206A.<br>
[0140]<br>
As to operations after Step S560A, when receiving a message and a<br>
display request from the bytecode 112A, the bytecode execution unit 124A<br>
of the content playback apparatus 102A outputs the received message and<br>
display request to the display control unit 134A. Herewith, the content<br>
playback apparatus performs Step S406A and the subsequent process.<br>
(7) Modifications<br>
(7.1) In Embodiment 2, the messages for display are associated<br>
with error codes; however, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
case.<br>
[0141]<br>
The error codes may be associated with state identification<br>
information that identifies events taking place when the content<br>
playback apparatus is in operation.<br>
Accordingly, if an event that was not envisioned at the time of<br>
manufacture occurs during the operation, it is possible to treat the<br>
event as an error even after the shipment of the content playback<br>
apparatus.<br>
Such an event occurring during the operation is, for example, the<br>
speed of fast-forwarding during the playback reaches its performance<br>
limit. Another example is an event of decryption failure. In<br>
57<br><br>
Embodiment 2, the content playback apparatus performs a two-stage<br>
decryption (decryption of the encrypted content key, and decryption of<br>
the protected content data) on the content. Here, if a three-stage<br>
encryption has been performed on the content of the recording medium,<br>
the two-stage decryption cannot be performed on it.<br>
[0142]<br>
(7.2) In Embodiment 1 above, in the case of displaying a message<br>
corresponding to apparatus unique information of the content playback<br>
apparatus, the playback control unit of the content playback apparatus<br>
stops (aborts) the content playback; however, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this.<br>
A playback stop step for stopping '(aborting) the content playback<br>
may be included in the bytecode in the case of displaying a message.<br>
Here, the content playback apparatus can inhibit the content playback by<br>
executing the playback stop step during the execution of the bytecode.<br>
Herewith, the bytecode is capable of having the content playback<br>
apparatus inhibit the content playback.<br>
[0143]<br>
Similarly, in the case of overlay display of a message, an<br>
overlay display step for displaying a message over the content being<br>
played back may be included in the bytecode. Here, the bytecode<br>
execution unit of the content playback apparatus executes the overlay<br>
display step during the execution of the bytecode, and thereby the<br>
display unit is capable of displaying a message over the content being<br>
played back.<br>
[0144]<br>
In addition, in the case of switching between stopping the<br>
content playback and realizing overlay display, a switching step may be<br>
58<br><br>
included in the byteccde. In the switching step, a user instruction is<br>
received, and either inhibiting of the content playback or overlay<br>
display of a message is performed in accordance with the received<br>
instruction. Here, the content playback apparatus executes the<br>
switching step during the execution of the byteccde, and thereby<br>
receives an instruction from the user and performs either inhibition of<br>
the content playback or overlay display of a message in accordance with<br>
the received instruction. Herewith, the byteccde is capable of having<br>
the content playback apparatus take control to perform either inhibition<br>
of the content playback or overlay display of a message.<br>
[0145]<br>
In the case of including control information in the byteccde as<br>
described in (1) under Other Modifications, the content playback<br>
apparatus is capable of reading the control information and performing<br>
either inhibition of the content playback or overlay display of a<br>
message based on the read control information. Alternatively, the<br>
byteccde may output the control information to the byteccde execution<br>
unit of the content playback apparatus by interacting with the content<br>
playback apparatus and perform the process based on the control<br>
information received by the byteccde execution unit. Note that<br>
"interacting with the content playback apparatus" means interaction of<br>
information between the byteccde and a program different from the<br>
bytecode 112 executed by the bytecode execution unit 124 of the content<br>
playback apparatus.<br>
[0146]<br>
The content playback apparatus may include in advance a process<br>
control unit that takes control to perform either inhibition of the<br>
content playback or overlay display of a message. The content playback<br>
59<br><br>
apparatus executes the operation of the process control unit in the case<br>
of receiving a message indicating that the apparatus is in an anomalous<br>
state by the interaction with the bytecode. The operation of the<br>
process control unit includes, for example, receiving from the user<br>
either an instruction for inhibiting the playback or an instruction for<br>
overlay display of a message and performing either one of them according<br>
to the received instruction. As another example, in the case where<br>
control information is recorded on the recording medium, the process<br>
control unit reads control information from the recording medium, and<br>
performs either inhibition of the content playback or overlay display of<br>
a message, based on the read control information.<br>
[0147]<br>
Note that, similarly in Embodiment 2, the step of stopping<br>
(aborting) the content playback may be included in the bytecode. In<br>
addition, the step of displaying a message over the content being played<br>
back may be included in the bytecode. In addition, the switching step<br>
may be included in the bytecode.<br>
Alternatively, the content playback apparatus may include in<br>
advance a process control unit that takes control to perform either<br>
inhibition of the content playback or overlay display of a message. The<br>
content playback apparatus executes the operation of the process control<br>
unit in the case of receiving a message indicating that the apparatus is<br>
in an anomalous state by the interaction with the bytecode.<br>
[0148]<br>
(7.3) In Embodiment 1, the anomalous-apparatus table is included<br>
in the bytecode; however, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
case.<br>
60<br><br>
The anomalous-apparatus table may be recorded, on the recording<br>
medium, in an area different from the area recording the bytecode.<br>
Similarly, in Embodiment 2, the anomalous-state table may be<br>
recorded, on the recording medium, in an area different from the area<br>
recording the bytecode.<br>
[0149]<br>
(7.4)	The apparatus unique information of the present invention<br>
is information including at least one of the apparatus maker ID, model<br>
number, manufacturing serial number, and firm version number stored in<br>
the apparatus unique information storage unit 133.<br>
(7.5)	The present invention includes a structure in which two or<br>
more of the above embodiments and modifications are combined.<br>
(8) Summary<br>
Conventional technology is able to determine an anomalous state<br>
that has been anticipated in advance (i.e. an anomalous state<br>
anticipated at the time of manufacture of a terminal apparatus, such as<br>
a content playback apparatus) and provide the user with a message<br>
corresponding to the anomalous state. However, as to an anomaly that<br>
has not been anticipated in advance (an anomalous state identified after<br>
the shipment) , such as an anomalous state due to bugs, it cannot<br>
determine the anomalous state and provide the user with a message<br>
corresponding to the anomalous state.<br>
[0150]<br>
Additionally, in the conventional technology, how to notify the<br>
user for what kind of anomalous state is generally an implementation<br>
matter specified by the terminal apparatus manufacturer. It is<br>
therefore difficult to reflect the intention of the content's copyright<br>
holder, and/or to allow the copyright holder to control such messages.<br>
61<br><br>
Especially, the conventional technology is not capable of determining,<br>
on a terminal apparatus manufactured by a manufacturer with malicious<br>
intent, an anomalous state that has been predetermined in accordance<br>
with the desire of the copyright holder, and providing the user with a<br>
message corresponding to the anomalous state.<br>
[0151]<br>
Contrarily, the present invention is capable of determining an<br>
anomalous state that has not been anticipated in advance and providing<br>
the user of a message corresponding to the anomalous state. Also, it is<br>
able to determine an anomalous state that has been predetermined in<br>
accordance with the desire of the content's copyright holder and provide<br>
a message corresponding to the anomalous state.<br>
In addition, the recording medium, data processing apparatus (e.g.<br>
the content playback apparatus mentioned above), and data processing<br>
method of the present invention are useful in the field where content<br>
data that is a copyrighted work, such as a movie, is stored on a<br>
recording medium and the content data on the recording medium is played<br>
back.<br>
[0152]<br>
(8.1) The present invention is a recording medium recording<br>
thereon a program which is read and executed by a data processing<br>
apparatus. This recording medium is characterized by the program<br>
recorded thereon which comprises the steps of: receiving information<br>
stored or acquire by the data processing apparatus; acquiring a message<br>
corresponding to the received information; and presenting a display<br>
request for the acquired message to the data processing apparatus.<br>
[0153]<br>
62<br><br>
(8.2)	Here, as to the recording medium of (8.1) above, the<br>
information may be apparatus unique information used for identifying an<br>
unauthorized or anomalous data processing apparatus, and the message may<br>
be a message notifying the user of the data processing apparatus that<br>
the data processing apparatus is an unauthorized or anomalous one.<br>
(8.3)	Here, as to the recording medium of (8.1) above, the<br>
information may be apparatus state information indicating that the data<br>
processing apparatus is in an unauthorized or anomalous data processing<br>
state, and the message may be a message notifying the user of the data<br>
processing apparatus that the data processing apparatus is in an<br>
unauthorized or anomalous data processing state.<br>
[0154]<br>
(8.4)	The present invention is also a data processing apparatus<br>
for executing a program read from the recording medium of one of (8.1)<br>
to (8.3) above. The data processing apparatus is characterized by<br>
comprising: a reading unit operable to reading the program from the<br>
recording medium; a program executing unit operable to execute the read<br>
program; a notifying unit operable to notify stored or acquired<br>
information; and a display unit operable to display a message in<br>
accordance with a message display request received from the program.<br>
[0155]<br>
(8.5)	Here, as to the data processing apparatus of (8.4) above,<br>
the information may be apparatus unique information used for identifying<br>
an unauthorized or anomalous data processing apparatus, and the message<br>
may be a message notifying the user of the data processing apparatus<br>
that the data processing apparatus is an unauthorized or anomalous one.<br>
(8.6)	Here, as to the data processing apparatus of (8.4) above,<br>
the information may be apparatus state information indicating that the<br>
63<br><br>
data processing apparatus is in an unauthorized or anomalous data<br>
processing state, and the message may be a message notifying the user of<br>
the data processing apparatus that the data processing apparatus is in<br>
an unauthorized or anomalous data processing state.<br>
[0156]<br>
(8.7) The present invention is also a data processing method used<br>
on a data processing apparatus that executes a program read from a<br>
recording medium. The data processing method is characterized by<br>
comprising: a reading step in which the data processing apparatus reads<br>
the program from the recording medium; an execution step in which the<br>
data processing apparatus executes the read program; a 1st notifying step<br>
in which the data processing apparatus notifies stored or acquired<br>
information to the executed program; a receiving step in which the<br>
program receives the information notified from the data processing<br>
apparatus; an acquisition step in which the program acquires a message<br>
nci <br>
corresponding to the received information; a 2 notifying step in which<br>
the program notifies a display request for the acquired message; and a<br>
display step in which the data processing apparatus displays the message<br>
in accordance with the display request notified from the program.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0157]<br>
