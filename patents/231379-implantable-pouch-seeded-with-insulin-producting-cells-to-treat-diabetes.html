				<td>IMPLANTABLE POUCH SEEDED WITH INSULIN-PRODUCING<br>
CELLS TO TREAT DIABETES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an implantable<br>
pouch seeded vith insulin releasing cells to treat<br>
diabetes. More specifically, the present invention<br>
provides an implantable porous pouch containing an opening<br>
for loading insulin releasing cells? to treat diabetes<br>
mellitus and which opening may thereafter be closed and,<br>
if desired, sealed shut.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pancreatic tissue consists of three parts: exocrine,<br>
endocrine, and ducts. The endocrine pancreas contains<br>
islet cells responsible for release; of four distinct<br>
hormones, and such islets consist of four separate cell<br>
types: δαβ and polypeptide cells that produce the<br>
hormones glucagons, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic<br>
polypeptide, respectively. As established in the prior art<br>
relating to the identification of endocrine cells, several<br>
key transcription factors have been identified which are<br>
essential in the development of beta cells including Pdxl,<br>
Ngn3, Hlxb9, Xkx6, Isll, P*x6, Neurod, Hnfla, Hnf6 and<br>
others. See, for example. Nature Reviews Genetics, Vol3,<br>
524-632, 2002.<br>
A common disease of the endocrine pancreas, diabetes<br>
mellitus (DM), results from the destruction of beta cells<br>
(Type I DM) or from insensitivity of muscle or adipose<br>
tissues to the hormone insulin (Type II DM). Current<br>
methods of treatment of both Type 1 and Type II DM<br>
includes diet and exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents,<br><br>
insulin injections, insulin pump therapy, and whole<br>
pancreas or islet transplantation.<br>
The most common treatment involves daily injections<br>
of an endogenous Bource of insulin such as porcine,<br>
bovine, or hurtan insulin. The patient will usually follow<br>
a regime involving self-monitoring of blood glucose levels<br>
where insulin will be injected according to a prescribed<br>
plan based on the results of such blood analysis.<br>
Another, less common, treatment approach has been<br>
transplantation of the whole pancreas organ. Such<br>
transplants of a whole, adult pancreas are major,<br>
technically complex operations which also require<br>
aggressive treatment with immunosuppressive drugs to avoid<br>
rejection of the newly transplanted organ. Such organs<br>
are typically obtained from deceased, human donors, and<br>
the limited availability of such cadaver pancreas<br>
restricts the widespread use of this approach.<br>
In the transplant field, many have suggested that it<br>
would be advantageous to separate the insulin-producing<br>
islets from the remainder of the pancreas tissue. Such<br>
advantages include less invasive surgery due to the lower<br>
tissue mass being transplanted. In addition there would<br>
be increased access to immunomanipulation, and engineering<br>
of the graft cbmposition.<br>
Until recantly, islet grafting has been generally<br>
unsuccessful due to aggressive immune rejection of islets.<br>
Recent reports {N. Eng, J. Med. 343:230-238, 2000;<br>
Diabetes, 50:710-719, 2001) indicate that a<br>
glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimen can<br>
significantly benefit the patients with brittle type I<br>
diabetes. However, the patients using this treatment are<br>
prone to renal complications, mouth ulcers, and require<br>
large number of islets (-9000 islet equivalents/kg of<br><br>
patient weight) required to induce normoglycemia. Thus,<br>
there has been an intense effort to devise islet cell<br>
transplantation strategies that avoid the large doses of<br>
immunosuppressive drugs and use a commercially viable<br>
islet cell souirce. This has led to the concept of<br>
immunoisolation (Diabetologia, 45:159-173, 2002) which<br>
involves shielding of the islets with a selectively<br>
permeable membrane. The membrane allows passage of small<br>
molecules, sucih as nutrients, oxygen, glucose, and<br>
insulin, while restricting the passage of larger humoral<br>
immune molecules and immune cells. In theory, one could<br>
use an immunoisolation device with an abundant animal<br>
islet cell source, such as porcine, to treat DM. However,<br>
in practice this approach has had little success in large<br>
animal models or in clinic due to fibrosis of the device,<br>
limited oxyger. supply within the device, and passage of<br>
small humoral immune molecules which lead.to islet loss.<br>
An alterr.ative approach to immunoisolation is the<br>
creation of ar. immunologically privileged site by<br>
transplanting Sertoli cells into a nontesticular site in a<br>
mammal (US 5,649,265, US 6,149,907,, US 5,958,404). This<br>
site allows fcr subsequent transplantation of islets that<br>
produce insulin. The immune privileged site would allow<br>
transplantaticn of either human or animal derived islets.<br>
One of the drawbacks of this approach is that the<br>
transplanted Sertoli and islet cells are not physically<br>
restricted to site of transplantation. This-can lead to<br>
migration of these cells to unwanted tissue sites. If the<br>
islets migrate away from the Sertoli cells, it could<br>
ultimately lead to the loss of islets through loss of the<br>
immunosuppressive effect of. the Sertoli cells as the<br>
immune-privileged environment created by Sertoli cells is<br>
most effective when the islets are in close proximity.<br><br>
The recent emergence of tissue engineering offers<br>
alternative approaches to treat diabetes. Tissue<br>
engineering st rategies have explored the use of various<br>
biomateriale in combination with cells and/or growth<br>
factors to develop biological substitutes that ultimately<br>
can restore or improve tissue function. For example,<br>
scaffold materials have been extensively studied as tissue<br>
templates, corduits, barriers, and reservoirs useful for<br>
tissue repair. In particular, synthetic and natural<br>
materials in the form of foams, sponges, gels, hydrogels,<br>
textiles, and nonwovens have been used in vitro and in<br>
vivo to reconstruct and/or regenerate biological tissue,<br>
as well as deliver chemotactic agents for inducing tissue<br>
growth (US5770417, US6022743, US5567612, US5759830).<br>
One of the key requirements for a scaffold is the<br>
retention of cells following seeding onto the scaffold.<br>
Until now, scaffolds have been constructed as a substrate<br>
material upon which cells, such as islets, are seeded.<br>
Traditional porous matrices, such as polygycolic acid<br>
nonwovens or polylactic acid foams, though, have a pore<br>
size that is either too large or too small to sufficiently<br>
retain pancreatic islets or islet-like structures.<br>
Another key requirement for a scaffold loaded with<br>
insulin secreting cells is the availability of a<br>
functional microvascular bed that s.llows for exchange of<br>
essential nutrients and maintenance of high oxygen<br>
tension. Therefore, there remains a need for a three-<br>
dimensional construct that can be seeded with a large<br>
number of insulin-producing cells, retain the majority of<br>
the cells following implantation, and provide a vascular<br>
milieu for cell survival. The biodegradable construct of<br>
the present invention provides such a three-dimensional<br>
porous matrix.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THIS INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an implantable<br>
pouch that is suitable for use in seeding and subsequent<br>
implantation of plurality of mammalian cells including<br>
ineulin-producing cells. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
walls of the pouch are biocompatible and composed of a<br>
foam matrix reinforced with a biocompatible mesh, in use,<br>
the lumen of the pouch is loaded with an insulin-secreting<br>
cell suspension. The biocompatible matrix encapsulating<br>
the mesh is preferably porous, polymeric foam, preferably<br>
formed using a, lyophilization process. The construct may<br>
also be used to provide a vascular bed prior to<br>
introduction cf insulin secreting cells. The lumen of the<br>
pouch may be filled with a biocompatible plug, to restrict<br>
tissue growth into the lumen, and implanted into a<br>
clinically relevant site followed by removal of the plug<br>
at a later tine and injection of the insulin-secreting<br>
cells into the lumen of the pouch. The pouch may be<br>
optionally loaded with one or more biologically active<br>
compounds or hydrogels. The wall of the pouch preferably<br>
is made from a polymer whose glass transition temperature<br>
is below physiologic temperature so that the pouch will<br>
minimize irritation when implanted in soft tissues.<br>
The construct of the present invention can also act<br>
as a vehicle to deliver cell-secreted biological factors<br>
or synthetic pharmaceuticals. Such agents may direct up-<br>
regulation or down-regulation of growth factors, proteins,<br>
cytokines or proliferation of other cell types. A number<br>
of cells may ke seeded on such a pouch before or after<br>
implantation into a diseased mammal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An implantable tissue scaffold pouch is disclosed<br>
herein which is used in treatment of diabetes. A<br>
perspective view of the implantable tissue scaffold pouch<br>
is provided ir. Figure 1. The implantable pouch l consists<br>
of a wall 2 surrounding an interior lumen 5. The wall 2<br>
is preferably composed of a porous foam matrix 3<br>
reinforced with, most preferably, a mesh 4. The interior<br>
lumen will have a volume of at least 1 x 10"3 cm3.<br>
Preferably it will be at least 0.1 cm3. The number and<br>
size of the irsulin-producing cells* along with site of<br>
implantation will dictate the dimensions of the pouch 1.<br>
The porous pouch 1 will generally have a longitudinal axis<br>
and a cross-section that may be circular, oval or<br>
polygonal. Preferred for ease of manufacture is an oval<br>
shaped cross-section.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a pouch constructed from two<br>
rectangular shsets sealed on three sides and open at one<br><br>
necessary ie a lumen to be formed by the wall 2 euch that<br>
a cavity ia fcrmed sufficient for placement of islets or<br>
islet-like cells. Thus, the pouch could be constructed<br>
from one sheet or from multiple sh«ets and sealed in some<br>
appropriate manner together.<br>
The walle 2 of the pouch 1 contain pores 6 that may<br>
range from abcut 0.1 to about 500 microns and preferably<br>
in the range cf from about 5 to about 400 microns. The<br>
lumen 5 of implantable pouch 1 may be filled with a<br>
hydrogel or a matrix containing a cell suspension or with<br>
a non-porous slab of nondegradable material that may be<br>
removed at a later time following transplantation and<br>
replaced with a cell suspension.<br>
The foam component 3 of the wall 2 is preferably<br>
elastomeric, with pore size in the range of 5-400 m. The<br>
foam 3 may be loaded with biologically active or<br>
pharmaceutically active compounds (e.g. cytokines (e.g.<br>
interlukine 1-18; interferons α β, and y; growth factors;<br>
colony stimulating factors, chemok:i.nes, etc.), non-<br>
cytokine leukccyte chemotactic agents (e.g. C5a, LTB4,<br>
etc.), attachment factors, genes, peptides, proteins,<br>
nucleotides, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-apoptotic<br>
agents, carbohydrates or synthetic molecules.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the reinforcing<br>
component 4 of the wall 2 can be comprised of any<br>
absorbable or non-absorbable biocompatible material,<br>
including textiles with woven, knitted, warped knitted<br>
(i.e., lace-like), non-woven, and braided structures. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the reinforcing component 4 has a<br>
mesh-like strvcture.<br>
In any oi the above structures, mechanical properties<br>
of the material can be altered by changing the density or<br><br>
texture of the material, or by embedding particles in the<br>
material. The fibers used to make the reinforcing<br>
component 4 can be monofilaments, yarns, threads, braids,<br>
or bundles of fibers. These fibers can be made of any<br>
biocompatible material including bioabsorbable materials<br>
such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA),<br>
polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDO), trimethylene<br>
carbonate (TMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) , copolymers or<br>
blends thereof. In one embodiment, the fibers are formed<br>
of a polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid copolymer at a<br>
95:5 mole ratib. In another embodiment, the fibers are<br>
formed from a 100% PDO polymer.<br>
The wall 2 of the implantable pouch 1 will be made<br>
with a biocompatible material that may be absorbable or<br>
non-absorbable. The wall 2 will preferably be made from<br>
biocompatible materials that are flexible and thereby<br>
minimizing irritation to the patient. Preferably the wall<br>
2 will be made from polymers or polymer blends having<br>
glass transition temperature below physiologic<br>
temperature. Alternatively the pouch can be made with a<br>
polymer blended with a plasticizer that makes it flexible.<br>
Numerous biocompatible absorbable and nonabsorbable<br>
materials can be used to make the foam component 3.<br>
Suitable nonabsorbable materials include, but are not<br>
limited to, polyamides, polyesters (e.g. polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polybutyl terphthalate, copolymers and<br>
blends thereof), fluoropolymers (e.g.<br>
polytetrafluoromethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride,<br>
copolymers and blends thereof), polyolefins, polyvinyl<br>
resins (e.g. polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc.) and<br>
blends thereof.<br>
A variety of bioabsorbable polymers can be used to<br>
make the wall 2 of the present invention. Examples of<br><br>
suitable biocompatible and bioabsorbable polymers include<br>
but are not lsmited to polymers selected from the group<br>
consisting of aliphatic polyesters, poly(amino acids),<br>
copoly(ether-esters) , polyalkylene3 oxalates, polyamides,<br>
tyrosine derived polycarbonates, poly(iminocarbonates),<br>
polyorthoestere, polyoxaesters, polyamidoesters,<br>
polyoxaesters containing amine groups, poly(anhydrides),<br>
polyphosphazenes, biomolecules (i.e., biopolymers such as<br>
collagen, elastin, bioabsorbable starches, etc.) and<br>
blends thereof.<br>
Particulerly well suited for use in the present<br>
invention are biocompatible absorbable polymers selected<br>
from the group consisting of aliphatic polyesters,<br>
copolymers and blends which include but are not limited to<br>
homopolymers and copolymers of lactide (which includes D<br>
L-, lactic acid and D-, L- and meso lactide), glycolide<br>
(including glycolic acid), oxaesters, epsilon-<br>
caprolactone, p-dioxanone, alkyl substituted derivatives<br>
of p-dioxanone (i.e. 6,6-dimethyl-l,4-dioxan-2-one,<br>
trimethylene carbonate (l,3-dioxan-2-one), alkyl<br>
substituted derivatives of 1,3-dioxanone, delta-<br>
valerolactone, beta-butyrolactone, gamma-butyrolactone,<br>
epsilon-decalaatone, hydroxybutyrate, hydroxyvalerate,<br>
l,4-dioxepan-2-one and its dimer 1,5,8,12-<br>
tetraoxacyclotetradecane-7,l4-dione, 1,5-dioxepan-2-one,<br>
and polymer blends thereof.<br>
The reinforcing component 4 of the wall 2 is<br>
preferably composed from lactide and glycolide sometimes<br>
referred to herein as simply homopolymers and copolymers<br>
of lactide and glycolide and copolymers of glycolide and<br>
epsilon-caprolactone, most preferred for use as a mesh is<br>
a copolymer that is from about 80 weight percent to about<br>
100.weight percent glycolide with the remainder being<br><br>
laetide. More preferred are copolymers of from about 85<br>
to about 95 weight percent glycolide with the remainder<br>
being laetide Another preferred polymer is 100% PDO.<br>
Preferred foam component 3 is composed of<br>
homopolymers, copolymers, or blends of glycolide, laetide,<br>
polydioxanone, and epBilon-caproloactone. More preferred<br>
are copolymers of glycolide and caprolactone. Most<br>
preferred is a 65:35 glycolide:caprolactone copolymer.<br>
As used herein, the term "glycolide" is understood to<br>
include polyglycolic acid. Further, the term "laetide" is<br>
understood to include L-lactide, D-lactide, blends<br>
thereof, and lactic acid polymers and copolymers.<br>
A particularly desirable composition includes an<br>
elastomeric ccpolymer of from about: 35 to about 45 weight<br>
percent epsilcn-caprolactone and from about 55 to about 65<br>
weight percent glycolide, laetide (or lactic acid) and<br>
mixtures thereof. Another particularly desirable<br>
composition includes para-dioxanon€! homopolymer or<br>
copolymers containing from about 0 to about 80 weight<br>
percent para-dioxanone and from about 0 to about 20 weight<br>
percent of eitiier laetide, glycolide and combinations<br>
thereof. The iegradation time for the membrane in-vivo is<br>
preferably longer than 1 month but is shorter than 6<br>
months and mora preferably is longer than 1 month but less<br>
than 4 months.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymers used in the<br>
present invention can be varied as is well know in the art<br>
to provide the desired performance characteristics.<br>
However, it is preferred to have aliphatic polyesters<br>
having a molecular weight that provides an inherent<br>
viscosity between about 0.5 to about 5.0 deciliters per<br>
gram (dl/g) as measured in a 0.1 g/dl solution of<br><br>
hexafluoroisooropanol at 25 °C, and preferably between<br>
about 0,7 and 3.5 deciliters per gram (dl/g).<br>
Alternat Lvely, the reinforcing component 4 of the<br>
wall 2 can be a nonwoven scaffold. The nonwoven scaffold<br>
can be fabricated using wet-lay or dry-lay fabrication<br>
techniques. Fusing the fibers of the nonwoven scaffold of<br>
the tissue scaffold pouch 1 with another biodegradable<br>
polymer, usincj a thermal process, can further enhance the<br>
structural integrity of the fibrous nonwoven scaffold of<br>
the tissue scsiffold pouch 1. For example, bioabsorbable<br>
thermoplastic polymer or copolymer, such as<br>
polycaprolactone (PCL) in powder form, may be added to the<br>
nonwoven scaffold followed by a mild heat treatment that<br>
melts the PCL particles while not affecting the structure<br>
of the fibers. This powder possesses a low melting<br>
temperature and acts as a binding agent later in the<br>
process to increase the tensile strength and shear<br>
strength of the nonwoven scaffold. The preferred<br>
particulate powder size of PCL is in the range of 10-500<br>
Jim in diameter, and more preferably 10-150 |im in diameter<br>
Additional binding agents include a biodegradable<br>
polymeric bindsrs selected from the group consisting of<br>
polylactic acii, polydioxanone and polyglycolic acid or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the fibers in the nonwoven scaffold<br>
may be fused together by spraying cr dip coating the<br>
nonwoven scaffold in a solution of another biodegradable<br>
polymer.<br>
The foam :5 surrounding the lumen 5 of the present<br>
pouch 1 may be formed by a variety of techniques well<br>
known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For<br>
example, the polymeric starting materials may be foamed by<br>
lyophilization. supercritical solvent foaming, gas<br><br>
injection extrusion, gas injection molding or casting with<br>
ah extractable material (e.g., salts, sugar or similar<br>
suitable materials).<br>
In one embodiment, the foam portion 3 of the pouch l<br>
may be made by a polymer-solvent phase separation<br>
technique, suoh as lyophilization. Generally, however, a<br>
polymer solution can be separated into two phases by any<br>
one of the four techniques: (a) thermally induced<br>
gelation/crystallization; (b) non-solvent induced<br>
separation of solvent and polymer phases; (c) chemically<br>
induced phase separation, and (d) thermally induced<br>
spinodal decomposition. The polymer solution is separated<br>
in a controlled manner into either two distinct phases or<br>
two bicontinuous phases. Subsequent removal of the<br>
solvent phase usually leaves a porous structure of density<br>
less than the bulk polymer and pores in the micrometer<br>
ranges.<br>
The steps involved in the preparation of the foam<br>
component 3 of the wall 2 include choosing the appropriate<br>
solvents for the polymers to be lyophilized and preparing<br>
a homogeneous solution of the polymer in the solution.<br>
The polymer solution then is subjected to a freezing and a<br>
vacuum drying cycle. The freezing step phase-separates the<br>
polymer solution and the vacuum drying step removes the<br>
solvent by sublimation and/or drying, thus leaving a<br>
porous polymer structure, or an interconnected open-cell<br>
porous foam.<br>
Suitable solvents that may be used in the preparation<br>
of the foam scaffold component 3 include, but are not<br>
limited to, te :rahydrofuran (THF), dimethylene fluoride<br>
(DMF), and polydioxanone (PDO), p-xylene, N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, chloroform, 1,2-<br>
dichloromethan
 <br>
Among these solvents, a preferred sblvent is 1,4-dioxane.<br>
A homogeneous solution of the polytrmer in the solvent is'<br>
prepared using standard techniques.<br>
The applicable polymer concent ration or amount of<br>
solvent that may be utilized will vary with each system.<br>
Generally, the amount of polymer in the solution can vary<br>
from about 0.01% to about 90% by we; ght and, preferably,<br>
will vary from about 0.05% to about 30% by weight,<br>
depending on factors such as the so ubility of the polymer<br>
in a given solvent and the final properties desired in the<br>
foam scaffolding.<br>
When a mesh reinforcing material 4 will be used, it<br>
will be positioned between two thir (e.g., 0,4 mm) shims;<br>
it should be positioned in a substc ntially flat<br>
orientation at a desired depth in the mold. A metal or<br>
Teflon insert that has a cross sect ional area<br>
corresponding to that required for the pouch 1 is placed<br>
between two stretched layers of meah. The polymer<br>
solution is poured in a way that a. lows air bubbles to<br>
escape from between the layers of he mesh component.<br>
Preferably, the mold is tilted at desired angle and<br>
pouring is effected at a controllei rate to best prevent<br>
bubble formation. One of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that a number of variab es will control the.<br>
tilt angle and pour rate. General y, the mold should be<br>
tilted at an angle of greater than about 1 degree to avoid<br>
bubble formation. Ir. addition, th rate of pouring should<br>
be slow enough to enable any air b .bbles to escape from<br>
the mold, rather than to be trappe in the mold.<br>
If a mesh material is used as :he reinforcing<br>
component 4, the density of the men openings is an<br>
important factor in the formation of a resulting tissue<br>
implant with the desired mechanica] properties. A low<br><br>
density, or opsn knitted mesh material, is preferred. One<br>
particularly preferred material is a 90/10 copolymer of<br>
PGA/PLA, sold under the tradename VICRYL (Ethicon, Inc.,<br>
Somervilie, NJ). One exemplary low density, open knitted<br>
mesh is Knitted VICRYL VKM-M, available from Ethicon, Inc.,<br>
Somerville, NJ. Other knitted or woven mesh material that<br>
may be used in the pouch are 95/5 copolymer of PLA/PGA,<br>
sold under th€ tradename PANACRYL (Ethicon, Inc.,<br>
Somerville, NO, or 100% PDO polymer.<br>
The mammalian cells loaded into the lumen 5 of the<br>
pouch 1 may be isolated from pancreatic tissue including<br>
the exocrine, endocrine, and ductal components of the<br>
pancreas. Alternatively, minced pancreatic tissue or<br>
ductal fragments may be loaded into the lumen 5 of the<br>
pouch 1. Furthermore, the cells may be cultured under<br>
standard culture conditions to expand the number of cells<br>
followed by removal of the cells from culture plates and<br>
administerinc into the device prior to implantation.<br>
Alternatively, the isolated cells may be injected directly<br>
into the pouch 1 and then cultured under conditions which<br>
promote proliferation and deposition of the appropriate<br>
biological matrix prior to in vivo implantation. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the isolated cells are injected<br>
directly into the pouch l with no further in vitro<br>
culturing prSor to in vivo implantation. In another<br>
embodiment, Uhe cells are seeded into another porous<br>
biocompatible matrix, such as a nonwoven mat, a hydrogel,<br>
or combination thereof, followed by placement into the<br>
lumen 5 of the pouch.<br>
Cells that can be seeded or cultured on the construct<br>
of the current invention include, but are not limited to<br>
cells expressing at least one characteristic marker of a<br>
pancreatic beta cell. The cells can be seeded into the<br><br>
lumen 5 of the pouch of the present: invention for a short<br>
period of time (
cultured for longer {&gt; 1 day) period to allow for cell<br>
proliferation and matrix synthesis within the pouch 1<br>
prior to implantation.<br>
For treatment of a disease such as diabetes mellitus<br>
(DM), the cel.-seeded scaffold pouch 1 may be placed in a<br>
clinically convenient site such as the subcutaneous space,<br>
the mesentery, or the omentum. In this particular case,<br>
the pouch 1 of the present invention will act as a vehicle<br>
to entrap the administered cells in place after in vivo<br>
transplantation into an ectopic site.<br>
Previous attempts in direct transplantation of islets<br>
through injection into the portal circulation has proven<br>
inadequate in long-term treatment of diabetes.<br>
Furthermore, numerous methods of encapsulation of<br>
allogeneic ox xenogeneic beta cells with biodegradable or<br>
nondegradable microspheres have failed to sustain long-<br>
term control of blood glucose levels. These failures have<br>
been attributed to inadequate vasculature and/or immune<br>
rejection of transplanted islets.<br>
The failures can be circumvented by administering<br>
xenogeneic or allogeneic insulin-producing cells in<br>
combination with allogeneic or xenogeneic Sertoli cells<br>
which may aid in the survival of the islets and prevention<br>
of an immune response to the transplanted islets.<br>
Xenogeneic, allogeneic, or transformed Sertoli cells can<br>
protect themselves in the kidney capsule while<br>
immunoprotecting allogeneic or xenogeneic islets.<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the invention,<br>
the wall 2 of the pouch l may be modified either through<br>
physical or chemical means to contain biological or<br>
synthetic factors that promote attachment, proliferation,<br><br>
differentiation, and matrix synthesis of targeted cell<br>
types. Furthermore, the bioactive factors may also<br>
comprise part of the matrix for controlled release of the<br>
factor to elicit a desired biological function. Another<br>
embodiment would include delivery of small molecules that<br>
affect the up or down regulation of endogenous growth<br>
factors. Growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins,<br>
and biologically relevant peptide fragments that can be<br>
used with the matrices of the current invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, members of TGF~β family, including<br>
TGF-Pl, 2, ani 3, bone morphogenic proteins (BMP-2, -4, 6,<br>
-12, -13 and -14), fibroblast growth factors-1 and -2,<br>
platelet-derived growth factor-AA, and -BB, platelet rich<br>
plasma, insulin growth factor (IGF-I, II) growth<br>
differentiation factor (GDF-5, -6, -8, -10), angiogen,<br>
erythropoietin, placenta growth factor, angiogenic<br>
factors such as vascular endothelial cell-derived growth<br>
factor (VEGF), cathelicidins, defensins, glucacgon-like<br>
peptide I, exendin~4, pleiotrophin, endothelin,<br>
parathyroid hormone, stem cell factor, colony stimulating<br>
factor, tenascin-C, tropoelastin, thrombin-derived<br>
peptides, anti-rejection agents; analgesics, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents such as acetoaminophen, anti-apoptotic<br>
agents, statins, cytostatic agents such as Rapamycin and<br>
biological peptides containing cell- and heparin-bindlng<br>
domains of adhesive extracellular matrix proteins such as<br>
fibronectin and vitronectin. The biological factors may<br>
be obtained cither through a commercial source, isolated<br>
and purified from a tissue or chemically synthesized.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The folLowing examples illustrate the construction of<br>
a pouch for implanting cells and cellular matter in<br><br>
mammals. Those skilled in the art will realize that these<br>
specific examples do not limit the scope of this invention<br>
and many alternative forms of a pouch 1 could also be<br>
generated within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1; Fabrication of an Implantable Pouch<br>
A solution of the polymer to be lyophilized into a<br>
pouch was prepared. The polymer used to manufacture the<br>
foam component was a copolymer of 35% PCL and 65% PGA<br>
(35/65 PCL/PGA) produced by Birmingham Polymers Inc.<br>
(Birmingham, AL) with an I,V. of 1.79 dL/g, as measured in<br>
HFIP at 30 °C. A 95/5 weight ratio of 1,4-dioxane/(35/65<br>
PCL/PGA) was weighed out. The polymer and solvent were<br>
placed into a flask, which in turn was put into a water<br>
bath and stirred at 70°C for 5 hrs. The solution was<br>
filtered usirg an extraction thimble (extra coarse<br>
porosity, type ASTM 170-220 (EC)) and stored in a flask.<br>
Reinforcing mesh material formed of a 90/10 copolymer<br>
of polyglycolic/polylactic acid (PGA/PLA) knitted (Code<br>
VKM-M) mesh sold under the tradename VICRYL were rendered<br>
flat by ironing, using a compression molder at 80 °C/2<br>
min. After preparing the meshes, 0.4-mm shims were<br>
placed at each end of a 15.3 xl5.3 cm aluminum mold, and<br>
two meshes wore sized to fabricate the desired pouch size.<br>
The two mesh layers were stretched on top of each other<br>
between frame A and B as indicated in Figure 3 and the<br>
complex was shen positioned on the shims allowing the<br>
meshes to be suspended in solution to be added. A metal or<br>
a Teflon insert that has a cross sectional area<br>
corresponding to that of the opening of the required pouch<br>
(0.4x8.0 or 0.4x4.0 mm2) is placed between two stretched<br>
layers of mesh. The polymer solution heated to 50PC is<br>
poured slowly from the side until the top mesh layer is<br><br>
completely covered. Approximately 60 ml of the polymer<br>
solution was sldowly transferred into the mold, ensuring<br>
that the solution was well dispersed in the mold. The<br>
mold was then placed on a shelf in a Virtis, Freeze Mobile<br>
G freeze dryer The freeze dry sequence used in this<br>
example was: I) -17°C for 60 minutes; 2) -5°C for 60<br>
minutes under vacuum 100 mT; 3) 5°C for 60 minutes under<br>
vacuum 20 mT; 4) 20°C for 60 minutes under vacuum 20 mT.<br>
Figure 1 shows the resulting pouch containing the<br>
reinforced foam 3 surrounding the lumen of the pouch<br>
following the removal of the insert. Figure 2 depicts<br>
scanning electron micrograph (SEMs) of the cross-section<br>
of the pouch. The SEM clearly shows the lyophilized<br>
reinforced foam scaffold inside the pouch. The mold<br>
assembly was then removed from the freezer and placed in a<br>
nitrogen box overnight. Following the completion of this<br>
process the resulting construct was carefully peeled out<br>
of the mold in the form of a foam/mesh sheet containing a<br>
removable insert. The insert may be removed prior to<br>
loading of cells and in vivo implantation or removed at a<br>
later time following transplantation. In the latter case,<br>
cells are loaded into the lumen of the pouch upon removal<br>
of the insert.<br>
EXAMPLE 2; Fabrication of an Implantable Pouch<br>
A biodegradable pouch was fabricated following the process<br>
of Example 1, except a woven Vicryl (Code VWM-M5,<br>
reinforcing nesh material formed of a 90/10 copolymer of<br>
polyglycolic/polylactic acid (PGA/PLA) was used.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 s Fabrication of an Implantable Pouch<br>
A biodegradable pouch was fabricated following the process<br>
of Example 1, except a knitted reinforcing mesh material<br>
formed of 100% PDS was used.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4: IMPLANTABLE TISSUE SCAFFOLDS WITH MAMMALIAN<br>
CELLS<br>
This example illustrates seeding of murine islets<br>
within the lumen of the pouch described in this invention.<br>
Murine Islets were isolated from Balb/c mice by<br>
collagenase digestion of the pancreas and Ficoll density<br>
gradient centrifugation followed by hand picking of<br>
islets,<br>
Pouches were prepared as described in Example 1 and<br>
seeded with 5 00 fresh islets and cultured for 1 week in<br>
Hams-FlO (Gikco Life Technologies, Rockville, MD)<br>
supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.5%),<br>
nicotinamide (10 mM) , D-glucose (10 mM), L-glutamine (2<br>
mM) , IBMX (3-Isobutyl-l-methylxant:hine, 50 mM) , and<br>
penicillin/Streptomycin. Following 1 week, the islets<br>
residing in the pouches were stained with calcein and<br>
ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes, Oregon) to assay for<br>
viability of the seeded cells. Majority of the islets<br>
stained positive for calcein indicating viable cells<br>
within the lumen of the pouch.<br><br>
