				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to methods of, and apparatus for. determining which of a group of<br>
formats has been applied to an encoded signal that is capable of being decoded using the<br>
Viterbi algorithm. The Viterbi algorithm can be used to decode signals that have been<br>
encoded using, for example, a convolutional encoding scheme (recursive or non-recursive),<br>
a trellis code modulation (TCM) scheme or a multi-level coded modulation (MCM)<br>
scheme.<br>
One of the major applications of the Viterbi algorithm is in the Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (UMTS) to decode signals that have been encoded to protect<br>
transmitted bits against errors.<br>
In UMTS, a signal to be transmitted, comprising a stream of data bits, is formatted<br>
according to a transport format selected from amongst a group of available transport<br>
formats defined under the UMTS standard. When a signal is to be transmitted, it is<br>
transmitted as a series of blocks, each block being formatted in accordance with the<br>
selected transport format. Each transport format will accommodate a number of bits of the<br>
signal to be transmitted plus, amongst other things, a certain number of error checking bits.<br>
The identity of the transport format being employed may or may not be signalled to a unit<br>
receiving a transmitted signal. If no indication of the transport format is supplied to a unit<br>
receiving a transmitted signal, then the unit must determine the employed format itself in<br>
order to correctly decode the received signal.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a useful way of determining the format of a<br>
received communication signal, when said format is not explicitly signalled.<br>
According to one aspect the invention provides a method of assessing an encoded signal to<br>
determine whether a candidate format was used to arrange the signal into blocks before the<br>
encoding was done, the method comprising: using the Viterbi algorithm to determine trellis<br>
metrics for a point in said signal that would be an end point of a candidate block according<br>
to the candidate format; determining from said metrics the likelihood of occupation at said<br>
point of a termination state of an encoding scheme used to create the encoded signal;<br>
decoding a part of said signal ending at said point; and performing a check using said<br>
decoded part to determine whether the candidate block satisfies an error protection scheme<br>
of the candidate format.<br>
The invention also consists in apparatus for assessing an encoded signal to determine<br>
whether a candidate format was used to arrange the signal into blocks before the encoding<br>
was done, the apparatus comprising: calculating means applying the Viterbi algorithm to<br>
determine trellis metrics for a point in said signal that would be an end point of a candidate<br>
block according to the candidate format; assessing means for determining from said metrics<br>
the likelihood of occupation at said point of a termination state of an encoding scheme used<br>
to create the encoded signal; decoding means for decoding a part of said signal ending at<br>
said point; and checking means for performing a check using said decoded part to<br>
determine whether the candidate block satisfies an error protection scheme of the candidate<br>
format.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a way of determining if a candidate format has been applied to<br>
an encoded signal.<br>
In one embodiment, the determination of the likelihood of occupation of the termination<br>
state comprises comparing the metrics for the Viterbi trellis stage representing the<br>
candidate end point. Preferably, the likelihood of occupation is determined by way of<br>
comparing the maximum metric at the trellis stage representing the end point with the<br>
termination state metric at the same trellis stage. For example, the comparison of the<br>
maximum metric and the termination state metric can be carried out by normalising the<br>
termination state metric and the maximum metric relative to the minimum metric at the<br>
Viterbi trellis stage representing the end point specified by the candidate format, and then<br>
comparing the normalised maximum metric to a quantity formed by multiplying the<br>
normalised termination state metric by a factor.<br>
In one embodiment, the decoding of a part of the encoded signal finishing at the candidate<br>
end point is carried out only if there is sufficient likelihood of occupation of the encoding<br>
Scheme's termination state at the candidate end point. In another embodiment, the<br>
decoding operation proceeds irrespective of the assessed likelihood of termination state<br>
occupation.<br>
The invention involves checking to determine if a candidate block satisfies an error<br>
protection scheme used by the candidate format. In one embodiment, the candidate format<br>
comprises a data part and a checksum and the checking operation involves generating a<br>
corroborative checksum from the data part of the candidate block and also involves a<br>
comparison of the corroborative checksum with the checksum part of the candidate block.<br>
Preferably, the checksums are cyclic redundancy checksums, known as a CRCs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment where the candidate block is expected to conform to a candidate<br>
format comprising a data part and a checksum part containing a checksum established on<br>
the data part, the extent of the decoded part of the encoded signal has an effect on how the<br>
check is done to determine whether the candidate block satisfies the error protection<br>
scheme of the candidate format. Where the decoded part contains the entirety of what<br>
should be the data part of the candidate block according to the candidate format, then a<br>
corroborative checksum is generated from the data part of the candidate block that is<br>
provided by the decoded part and the corroborative checksum is compared with the<br>
checksum part of the candidate block. Where the decoded part of the signal contains a<br>
portion only of the data part of the candidate block then a corroborative checksum is<br>
generated from the decoded portion of the data part using an intermediate checksum value<br>
as a starting point. The intermediate checksum value may be, for example, a value<br>
obtained by generating a checksum on the basis of a part of the encoded signal that was<br>
decoded at an earlier time in an assessment of whether another candidate format was the<br>
true format being used for the signal.<br>
Amongst other tilings, the invention extends to format detection of received signals in<br>
basestations and subscriber units of wireless telecommunications networks.<br>
By way of example only, some embodiments of the invention will now be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, schematically, a number of UMTS transport formats;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates, schematically, a mobile telephone, showing primarily the processes<br>
involved in transport format detection;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates, schematically, an alternative arrangement for performing transport<br>
format detection within a mobile telephone; and<br>
Figure 4 illustrates, schematically, the operations performed by the arrangement shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
In a UMTS network, a transmitted signal is arranged according to a transport format<br>
selected from a group of predetermined transport formats. Figure 1 illustrates,<br>
schematically, three transport formats TF1, TF2 and TF3. Each transport format comprises<br>
a block of data bits D1, D2, D3, some tail bits T1, T2, T3 and a cyclic redundancy<br>
checksum (CRC) C1, C2. C3 established on the respective data block. The (main)<br>
difference between the transport formats is in the lengths of the data blocks D1, D2, D3.<br>
The data in the data blocks is not necessarily just information bits that can be used directly<br>
by a receiver. For example, a data block might comprise a mixture of control bits and<br>
encoded information.<br>
A signal to be transmitted is formatted in accordance with the selected transport format.<br>
Sufficient bits are taken from the signal to be transmitted to fill the data block of the<br>
selected transport format. A CRC is then generated on the data block. The CRC is<br>
attached to an end of the data block to produce, with an appropriate number of tail bits, a<br>
composite block which then undergoes convolutional encoding and is transmitted. The<br>
convolutional encoding scheme employed is "terminated", i.e. the encoding scheme<br>
commences operation in the all zero state and concludes encoding the composite block by<br>
returning to the all zero state. The all zero state is termed the "termination state". The tail<br>
bits, which are all set to state zero, are provided to achieve the termination. Of course, if<br>
the termination state of the encoding scheme were something other than the all zero state,<br>
then the tail bits would follow a different pattern. If there are further bits of the signal<br>
awaiting transmission, then these are used to produce farther convolutionally encoded<br>
composite blocks, with the process repeating as often as is necessary to transmit all of the<br>
data that is required to be sent.<br>
The process of determining the transport format of a received signal transmitted in such a<br>
manner will now be discussed with reference to Figure 2. which shows a mobile telephone<br>
10 and provides a schematic illustration of the processes involved in transport format<br>
detection. Signals arriving at the antenna 12 of the mobile telephone 10 are processed<br>
(indicated at 14) to recover the received signal in the form of a stream of soft decisions.<br>
The soft decisions are supplied to a Viterbi decoder 16 which undoes the effect of the<br>
convolutional encoding performed by the transmitter which supplied the received signal.<br>
The Viterbi decoder 16 decodes the received signal by using a trellis having a number of<br>
stages, each stage corresponding to the arrival of a number of soft decisions (dependent<br>
upon the rate of the encoder used on the signal being received) and comprehending a group<br>
of possible states that the Viterbi decoder can assume. At each stage of the trellis, a metric<br>
is calculated for each of the possible states. The metrics are then used to make decisions on<br>
the most likely transitions between states in neighbouring stages of the trellis. The<br>
decisions are recorded in a decision history 18.<br>
The telephone 10 is provided with information specifying the transport formats that could<br>
have been applied to the received signal when it was prepared for transmission to the<br>
telephone 10. The telephone 10 initially chooses the smallest transport format to be a<br>
candidate transport format for testing against the received signal.<br>
When the metrics for the stage of the trellis that would be the end stage if a composite<br>
block had been sent using the candidate format are produced by the Viterbi decoder 16,<br>
they are supplied to a metric test until 20 which analyses the metrics to assess the<br>
likelihood that the all zero state is the state that is occupied at this stage of the trellis. The<br>
all zero state is the termination state of the convolutional encoding scheme being<br>
employed, so occupancy of the all zero state potentially indicates that the end of a<br>
transmitted composite block has been reached. The test performed by the metric test unit<br>
20 is:<br>
(M0-Mmin) &gt; 0.625 (Mmax-Mmin)<br>
M0 is the metric of the all zero state at the candidate end stage of the trellis.<br>
Mmax is the largest metric at the candidate end stage of the trellis.<br>
Mmin is the smallest metric at the candidate end stage of the trellis.<br>
Of course, factors other than 0.625 could be used and such factors could be determined on<br>
the basis of simulation.<br>
If the condition specified above is satisfied by the metrics of the candidate end stage of the<br>
trellis, a trace-back is performed through the decision history 18 starting at the all zero state<br>
of the candidate end stage. The path that is followed through the decision history yields a<br>
Viterbi-decoded candidate block of the received signal. The candidate block then needs to<br>
be tested to determine if it concurs with the error protection scheme of the candidate<br>
transport format. This test is performed at CRC test unit 22.<br>
At CRC test unit 22, the candidate block is divided into a data block and a CRC in<br>
accordance with the candidate transport format. The data block portion of the candidate<br>
block is then passed through a CRC generation process in the CRC test unit 20. If the CRC<br>
produced by the data block portion of the candidate block agrees with the CRC portion of<br>
the candidate block then the candidate transport format is recorded as the true transport<br>
format in a transport format indication 24.<br>
If the CRC derived from the data block of the candidate block does not agree with the CRC<br>
portion of the candidate block, then the candidate transport format is determined to be<br>
incorrect. In this case, the transport format that is the next largest in the group of possible<br>
transport formats becomes the new candidate transport format and the Viterbi decoder then<br>
continues processing the trellis, accumulating further decisions in the decision history 18.<br>
Once the Viterbi decoder 16 has processed the trellis stage corresponding to the end<br>
position of a candidate block arranged according to the new candidate transport format, the<br>
metrics for that stage are supplied to the metric test unit 20. If the metrics of this stage pass<br>
the test condition, then a trace-back is performed through the decision history to generate a<br>
new candidate block for assessment by the CRC test unit 20.<br>
Thus, as the Viterbi decoder continues to process the stages of the trellis, the end positions<br>
of the possible transport formats are tested in turn, beginning with the smallest candidate<br>
format and ending, if the true format is not identified along the way, with the largest<br>
candidate format.<br>
It is not an absolute requirement that candidate formats are tested in the particular order of<br>
smallest to largest, although adopting this order allows another embodiment of the<br>
invention to operate in an efficient manner, as will now be described.<br>
Figure 3 shows another embodiment of a transport format detection scheme within a<br>
mobile telephone 30. In Figure 3, elements carried over from Figure 2 retain the same<br>
reference numerals and will not be described again in detail. The system shown in Figure 3<br>
includes a Viterbi decoder 40, a decision history 42, a metric test unit 44 and a CRC test<br>
unit 46. Whilst these elements fulfil similar functions to the corresponding elements in<br>
Figure 2, the order of the operations that are performed using these elements is different in<br>
Figure 3 and operation of these elements will now be described in more detail.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a situation where a signal to be decoded has one of three possible<br>
transport formats, each of the general type indicated in Figure 1. Figure 4 depicts the soft<br>
decisions of the received signal along the X axis. Position L0 denotes the start of the next<br>
block to be decoded. The positions L2, L4 and L6 denote the possible end positions of the<br>
next block to be decoded. Position L2 denotes the end position of a candidate block for the<br>
shortest of the three possible transport formats. Position L4 denotes the end of a candidate<br>
block conforming to the intermediate one of the three transport formats. Position L6<br>
denotes the end position of a candidate block conforming to the longest of the three<br>
transport formats. As mentioned above, this embodiment assesses the candidate formats in<br>
order of smallest to largest, i.e. a candidate block of length L2 is processed first, then a<br>
candidate block having length L4 is processed and finally a candidate block having length<br>
L6 is processed.<br>
The first candidate format to be assessed is the one which would result in a candidate block<br>
extending from LO to L2 and is hereinafter called the L2 format.<br>
The Viterbi decoder 40 processes the soft decisions from position LO to position L2 as<br>
indicated by arrow Ml. The decisions that the Viterbi decoder 40 makes in moving<br>
between the stages of the trellis representing the received signal are stored in decision<br>
history 42. Once the Viterbi decoder 40 has produced metrics for the trellis stage<br>
corresponding to position L2 within the received signal, the metric test unit 44 performs the<br>
same test as used by metric test unit 20 in Figure 2 in order to determine the likelihood that<br>
the all zero state is the state that is occupied at the trellis stage corresponding to position<br>
L2. Once the trellis decoder 40 has processed the signal up to the point L2, a trace back is<br>
performed through the decision history 42, commencing with the all zero state at the trellis<br>
stage for position L2. The trace back step is indicated by arrow TB1 in Figure 4.<br>
The decoded candidate block produced by the trace back step is then supplied to CRC test<br>
unit 46. The CRC test unit 46 uses the data block of the decoded candidate block in order<br>
to generate a CRC which is compared with the section of the decoded candidate block<br>
which is a CRC according to the candidate transport format. The process of generating a<br>
CRC on the basis of the data portion of the decoded candidate block is indicated by arrow<br>
E1 in Figure 4. It will be noticed that arrow E1 does not reach position L2 in the received<br>
signal. This is because the data block of the decoded candidate block ends before position<br>
L2 is reached, due to the inclusion of a CRC and tail bits in the candidate transport format.<br>
During the CRC generation process indicated by arrow E1, the CRC code that has been<br>
generated upon reaching position L1 within the received signal is stored for future use as<br>
will be explained later. If the CRC now generated from the data block of the decoded<br>
candidate block matches the CRC contained in the decoded candidate block, then the<br>
candidate block is deemed to pass the CRC test.<br>
If the L2 format passes the tests performed by metric test unit 44 and CRC test unit 46 then<br>
the L2 format is recorded as the true transport format in transport format indication 48. If<br>
the L2 format fails one or both of the metric and CRC tests, then the system proceeds to<br>
assess whether the second candidate transport format is the correct one. The second<br>
candidate transport format is the format which would result in a candidate block extending<br>
from position L0 to position L4 and is hereinafter called the L4 format.<br>
To begin assessing the L4 format, the content of the decision history 42 relating to the part<br>
of the signal extending between L0 and L1 is relinquished and the metrics for the trellis<br>
stages corresponding to the portion of the signal extending from position L2 to position L4<br>
are produced by the Viterbi decoder 40 as indicated by arrow M2. The decisions made by<br>
the Viterbi decoder 40 in moving from stage to stage within the trellis are logged in<br>
decision history 42. Upon production of metric values for the trellis stage corresponding to<br>
position L4, the metric test unit 44 can perform its test on the metrics for the trellis stage<br>
corresponding to position L4 and a trace back can be performed through the decision<br>
history 42 as indicated by arrow TB2. The trace back commences from the all-zero state of<br>
the trellis stage corresponding to position L4. It will be noted that the decision history 42<br>
only contains data for the section of the signal extending from L4 to L1 so the trace back is<br>
performed only as far as position L1. which is the point at which the CRC code was stored<br>
in the CRC test performed during the assessment of the L2 format.<br>
This stored CRC code is now retrieved by CRC test unit 46 and is used as a starting value<br>
for performing the CRC test on the candidate block extending from L0 to L4. Only the<br>
latter part of the data block of this candidate block was recovered during the TB2 trace<br>
back process and this section of the data block is now applied to the retrieved CRC code<br>
value in a CRC generation process to evolve a final CRC code value for the entire data<br>
block of the candidate block conforming to L4 format. The process of generating the final<br>
CRC code value is indicated by arrow E2 in Figure 4. Arrow E2 does not reach position<br>
L4 because the data block portion of the candidate block does not finish at the end of the<br>
candidate block due to the presence of a CRC code and tail bits at the end of the candidate<br>
block. During the CRC generation process indicated by arrow E2, the value of the CRC<br>
code generated upon reaching position L3 is saved for future use. The CRC value<br>
produced at the end of the process indicated by arrow E2 is compared by the CRC test unit<br>
46 with the CRC contained in the decoded candidate block. If these CRC values agree,<br>
then the decoded candidate block is considered to pass the CRC test.<br>
If the L4 format passes the test conducted by metric test unit 44 and the CRC test,<br>
conducted by unit 46, then the candidate transport format is recorded as the true transport<br>
format in the transport format indication 48. If the L4 candidate block fails one or both of<br>
the tests performed by the metric test unit 44 and the CRC test unit 46, then the system<br>
moves on to test the largest of the three available transport formats. The largest candidate<br>
format is the one which would result in a candidate block extending from position L0 to<br>
position L6 and is hereinafter called the L6 format.<br>
To assess the L6 format, the content of the decision history 42 relating to the part of the<br>
signal extending between L1 and L3 is purged and the Viterbi decoder 40 then proceeds to<br>
calculate metrics for the trellis stages extending from position L4 within the received signal<br>
to position L6, as indicated by arrow M3. The decisions made by the Viterbi decoder 40 in<br>
moving from stage to stage within the trellis are recorded in the decision history 42. Once<br>
the metrics of the trellis stage corresponding to position L6 have been calculated, the metric<br>
test unit 44 can assess the metrics of that stage and a trace back can be performed through<br>
the decision histoiy 42 as indicated by arrow TB3. The trace back is performed from the<br>
all zero state of the trellis stage corresponding to position L6. It will be noted that the<br>
decision history 42 only contains data for the section of the signal extending from L6 to L3<br>
so the trace back TB3 is only performed as far as position L3.<br>
The metric test unit 44 assesses whether the metrics for the trellis stage corresponding to<br>
position L6 satisfy the inequality mentioned earlier. If the metrics satisfy the inequality<br>
then the metrics of the L6 stage are judged to have passed the metric test and the all zero<br>
state of the trellis stage at position L6 is considered the state that is likely to be occupied.<br>
The CRC test unit 46 uses the information decoded during the trace back process indicated<br>
by TB3 to perform a CRC test on the L6 candidate block. At the start of the CRC test, the<br>
CRC test unit 46 retrieves the CRC code value that was stored for position L3 during the<br>
CRC test performed on the L4 candidate block. The retrieved CRC value is then used as<br>
the starting value for a CRC generation process. The part of the data block of the candidate<br>
block under the L6 format that extends forward from position L3 and which was decoded<br>
during the TB3 trace back operation is now applied to the retrieved CRC value for position<br>
L3 in a CRC generation process as indicated by arrow E3. As shown, arrow E3 ends at<br>
position L5, corresponding to the- end of the data block of the candidate block under the L6<br>
format. The final CRC value produced at the end of the CRC generation process is then<br>
compared with the CRC contained in the candidate block, decoded from the soft decisions<br>
in the portion of the signal lying between points L6 and L5. If these two CRC values<br>
coincide, then the L6 format is considered to pass the CRC test.<br>
If the L6 candidate format passes both the metric test and the CRC test, then the L6<br>
transport format is recorded as the true transport format in the transport format indication<br>
24.<br>
In the operation of the Figure 3 system as described above, the position L1 determines the<br>
CRC value that is stored during CRC generation process E1 and also the end point of trace<br>
back process TB2 and the start point of CRC generation process E2. Similarly, position L3<br>
determines the CRC value that is stored during CRC generation process E2 and also sets<br>
the end point of the trace back process TB3 and the start point of the CRC generation<br>
process E3. The position of point L1 relative to the end of the shortest candidate block at<br>
L2 and the position of L3 relative to the end of the intermediate length candidate block at<br>
L4 are chosen such that process TB3 overlaps process TB2 which in turn overlaps TB1.<br>
The purpose of these overlaps is to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in the decoded<br>
information obtained by the trace back operations. For example, the overlap between TB2<br>
and TB1 eliminates in CRC generation process E2 the effect of the trace back data<br>
generated during the part of process TB1 extending from point L2 to point L1. The<br>
purpose of excluding this data from the CRC generation process is to avoid using the least<br>
accurate part of the information provided by operation TB1.<br>
The advantages of the Figure 3 arrangement over the Figure 2 embodiment are that, with<br>
the exception of the overlaps between the trace back operations, there is no need to perform<br>
multiple trace back operations over the same data thus saving processing time. Moreover,<br>
the size of the decision history can now be reduced since there is no longer any need to<br>
perform a trace back over a decision history corresponding to the entire length of the largest<br>
possible candidate block. For example, in the situation shown in Figure 4, the decision<br>
history no longer needs to accommodate a trace back from L6 to L0 but only needs to be<br>
large enough to accommodate whichever of the three trace back processes TB1, TB2, TB3<br>
is the largest.<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A method of assessing an encoded signal to locate a format in a plurality<br>
of candidate formats (TF1-TF3) that was likely used to arrange the signal<br>
into blocks before the encoding was done, the method comprising<br>
performing a test on candidate formats in turn but refraining from testing<br>
further candidate formats once a candidate format passes the test, wherein<br>
the test determines whether or not a candidate format is likely to be the<br>
format used on the signal and the test, for a given candidate format,<br>
comprises using a Viterbi algorithm to determine trellis metrics for a<br>
point in said signal that would be an end point of a candidate block<br>
according to the given candidate format, determining from said metrics<br>
the likelihood of occupation at said point of an end state of an encoding<br>
scheme used to create the encoded signal, decoding a part of said signal<br>
ending at said point and performing a check using said decoded part to<br>
determine whether the candidate block satisfies an error protection<br>
scheme of the given candidate format.<br>
