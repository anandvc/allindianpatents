The invention relates to a false twist texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic yams.<br>
It is known to use false twist texturing machines of this type for crimping melt spun multifilament yams and, thus, to reproduce yarns having, if possible, a construction and appearance of natural fibers. To this end, the false twist texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations, with the yam in each processing station being treated by a plurality of processing units for purposes of improving it. In essence, the yarn is drawn and crimped in a false twist zone, and wound to a package after the crimping. To this end, the processing unhs of the station, such as, for example, feed roll systems, a heater, cooling device, and false twist unit, are mounted in a machine frame, so as to result in a predetermined yam path. A false twist texturing machine of this type is disclosed, for example, in NP 0 641 877. These types of false twist texturing machines are constructed such that a yarn is optimally crimped in each processing station with a defined yam path and predetermined yam treatment.<br>
New tendencies in the development of improving yam by false twist texturing, as are known, for example, from EP \ 103 641 Al and NP I 101 848 Al, show an increased interest in so-called novelty yams, which can be produced by a false twist texturing process. In the path of the yam, this requires additional treatment steps, which cannot be easily realized with the known false twist texturing machine.<br>
Accordingly, h is an object of the invention to further develop the false twist texturing machine of the described type such that it enables a flexible use for producing crimped standard yarns or for producing crimped novelty yams.<br>
The object of the present invention is accomplished by a false twist texturing machine with the characterizing features.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention is based on the recognifion that in the production of crimped standard yams and crimped novelty yams, it is possible to determine the different yarn treatments substantially in the feed portion of the process. To this end, the false twist texturing machine of the invention comprises a feed module for accommodating a withdrawal roll system. The feed module mounts a plurality of receiving devices for<br><br>
additional processing units for guiding and treating a yam or a plurality of yams. Thus, the feed module ensures a flexible arrangement of additional processing unhs. which are needed in comparison with a standard process for producing special novelty yams. The invention has the special advantage that it permits selecting for each producible yam type an assigned and already predetermined yam path by a corresponding arrangement of the processing units in the feed module.<br>
According to an advantageous further development of the invention as defined, the additional processing units are exchangeably connected with the feed module by means of the receiving devices. This makes h possible to perform a rapid process change, for example, from the production of a standard yam to the production of a novelty yarn.<br>
An advantageous further development of the invention especially suited for permanently connecting the receiving devices with the feed module. As a function of the production process, only those processing units are activated, which are required for the particular process.<br>
As additional processing units, it would be possible to provide seiecdveiy for each processing station additional feed roll systems, a draw pin, an entanglement device, and/or a package feed device. Thus, for example, the package feed device on the feed module permits feeding a second yarn to the process for producing a combinadon yam in the processing station. A draw pin or an entanglement device would make it possible to treat a yarn that is unwound by the feed roll system, in addition before it is false twist textured.<br>
To enable the operability of the processing units on the feed and processing modules within the false twist texturing machine in a simple manner, an advantageous further development of the invention provides for a servicing aisle, which is formed between the feed and processing modules. In this development, the processing module mounts at least one portion of the processing units, such as, for example, the false twist unit and the feed roll systems. From the servicing aisle, an operator is able to operate the processing units of both the feed module and the processing module.<br>
The further development of the invention ensures that the yam does not cross its path in the false twist texturing machine. The barely deflected yam path permits<br><br>
guiding the yam, irrespective of the yam type, in a very stable threadline. The arrangement of the heater and cooling device above the servicing aisle has the further advantage that an adequate length is realizable for heat treating and cooling the false twist yam. Furthermore, the modules joined to one frame section make it possible to realize a compact construction of the false twist texturing machine.<br>
For the production of so-called set yams or for a heat after treatment of the yarn, an advantageous further development of the invention provides for a second heater on the underside of the frame section, which mounts the processing module and the takeup module, Preferably the heater is arranged in a horizontally inclined position for generating by contact a uniform heating of the yam.<br>
For increasing flexibility, it is further proposed to form each of the feed roll systems by a godet that is looped by the yam several times, with a guide roll associated therewith. The godet is driven independently of adjacent feed roll systems by an individual drive. In particular, the godet is also advantageously suited for changing the yam course, so that no further yam guide elements are needed in the inlet region and outlet region of the second heater.<br>
The advantageous further development of the invention according to claim 10 is especially suited for producing combination yams of, for example, a crimped yarn and an elastic yarn, which are combined by an entanglement device directly after the crimping. To this end, an entanglement device is arranged on the processing module in the path of the yarn downstream of the false twist unit.<br>
In the following, the invention is described in greater detail with reference to an embodiment and the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figure I is a schemadc view of an embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention;<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are schematic views of some embodiments of a feed module of the false twist texturing machine of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of a further embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention.<br>
Figure I schematically illustrates a first embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention. The false twist texturing machine comprises a<br><br>
feed module 3, a processing module 2, and a takeup module 1, which are arranged in a machine frame with frame sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. The feed module 3 is supported by frame section 4.1, and the processing module 2 and takeup module 3 by frame section 4.3. The frame section 4.1 and frame section 4.3 are interconnected by frame section 4.2, which is arranged above feed module 3 and processing module 2. Between processing module 2 and feed module 3, a servicing aisle 5 is formed below frame section 4.2.<br>
In frame section 4 the processing module 2 is arranged on the side facing servicing aisle 5, and the takeup module 1 on the side opposite thereto. Along the takeup module 1, a doffing aisle 6 is provided. Associated with the doffmg aisle 6 is a second takeup module 1 of a second false twist texturing machine, which is arranged in mirror- symmetric relationship with the first false twist texturing machine. With that it is possible to transfer packages from two machines to a removal device and remove them through the doffmg aisle.<br>
In its longitudinal direction - in Figure 1, the drawing plane corresponds to the transverse plane - the false '.wist texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations, one for each yam. The takeup devices 18 occupy a width of three processing stations. For this reason, as will be described further below, the takeup module accommodates three takeup devices 18 one arranged above the other in a column.<br>
Each processing station includes a withdrawal roll system 10, which is attached to feed module 3. The design of feed module 3 will be described further below.<br>
Associated with each withdrawal roll system 10 of adjacent processing stations is a creel 7, which holds a plurality of feed yarn packages 8 for withdrawing yams 36. Each withdrawal roll system 10 is associated with one feed yam package 8. The withdrawal roll system 10 withdraws yam the 36 via a plurality of deflecting yam<br>
guides 9.<br>
With reference to the path of yam 36, additional processing units of the processing module are described in the following. In the direction of the advancing yam. downstream of withdrawal roll system 10, an elongate heater U extends, through which the yam advances. In so doing, the yarn is heated to a certain<br><br>
temperature. The heater could be constructed as a high-temperature heater, in which the temperature of the heating surface is above 300°C.<br>
In the direction of the advancing yam, downstream of heater U, a cooling device 12 is provided. The heater 11 and cooling device 12 are successively arranged in one plane, and supported by frame section 4.2 above servicing aisle 5. In the inlet region of heater II, a deflection roll 9.3 is provided, so that the yam 36 crosses servicing aisle 5 along a V-shaped path. To this end, it would also be possible to arrange the heater 1! and the cooling device 12 in two planes that extend relative to each other in the shape of a roof.<br>
On the side of servicing aisle 5 that faces feed module 3, the processing module 2 is arranged on frame section 4.3. In the direction of the advancing yam, the processing module 2 mounts, one below the other, a false twist unit 13, a draw roll system 14, and a set roll system 15. From the outlet end of cooling device 12, which is formed preferably by a cooling rail, the yam 36 advances to false twist unh !3. The false twist unit 13, which may be formed, for example, by a plurality of overlapping friction disks, is driven by a drive 26. As a false twist drive 26, h is preferred to use an electric motor, which is likewise arranged on processing module 2.<br>
The draw roll system 14 withdraws the yam 36 from the false twist zone, which forms between false twist unit 13 and withdrawal roll system 10. The draw roll system 14 and withdrawal roll system 10 are driven at different speeds for drawing the yam 36 in the false twist zone.<br>
Arranged downstream of draw roll system 14 is a set roll system 15, which advances the yam 36 directly into a second heater 16. To this end, the second heater 16 is arranged on the underside of frame section 4.3 and, thus, below processing module 2 and takeup module I. The second heater 16 forms a yam passageway from processing module 2 to takeup module I. As a result of integrating processing module 2, second heater 16, and takeup module 1 in frame section 4.3, a very short yarn path is realized, which is substantially U-shaped. To this end, the underside of takeup module 1 mounts a feed roll system 17, which withdraws the yam 36 directly from the second heater 16, and advances it to a takeup device 18 after a deflection of yam 36. The set roll system 15 and feed roll system 17 are driven at such a differential speed<br><br>
that they enable a shrinkage treatment of the yam 36 within the second heater 16. For this purpose, the second lieater 16 is a biphenyl-heated contact heater, which is inclined relative a horizontal by an angle alpha o. The angle ranges from 5° to 45°. This ensures that within the heating channel of second heater 16, the yam 36 undergoes a uniform heating that is caused by contact.<br>
In the case that no heat treatment of the yam is desired in the set zone, the second heater 16 is shut down or replaced with a guide tube.<br>
In the present embodiment, the takeup device 18 is schematically illustrated by a yam traversing device 20, a drive roll 19, and a package 21. The takeup device 18 also includes a tube magazine 22 for performing an automatic package doff. Auxiliary devices as are required for doffing full packages are not shown in greater detail.<br>
The feed roll systems 10, 14, 15, and 17 are identical in their construction, so that same is described below in greater detail with reference to the example of withdrawal roll system 10. Each feed roll system is formed by a godet 23 and a guide roll 24 associated therewith. The godet 23 is driven via a godet drive 25. Preferably, the godet drive 25 is an electric motor. The guide roll 24 is supported for free rotation, with the yam being guided by looping the godet 23 and guide roll 24 several times.<br>
The embodiment of the false twist texturing machine shown in Figure 1 comprises no additional processing units on feed module 3. Thus, each processing station is provided with processing units for drawing and texturing a fed yarn by a basic method. To this end, the withdrawal roll system 10 withdraws the yam 36 from a feed yam package 8 and t\dv'ances it into the false twist zone. Within the false twist zone, which is formed essentially between false twist unit 13 and deflection roll 9.3, the heater 11 and cooling device 12 are successively arranged in one plane. In this arrangement, a false twist that is produced in the yam 36 by false twist unit 13 is returned as far back as the heater 11, which leads to a permanent crimp in the multifilament yam. This crimp is subsequently set in cooling device 12. The draw roll system H withdraws the yarn 36 from the false twist zone and draws it. To this end, the draw roll system 14 is driven at a higher speed than the withdrawal roll system 10. After crimping the yam 36, a heat aftertreatment occurs, during which the yam is<br><br>
advanced by set rol! system 15 and feed roll system 17 downstream of the second heater. Subsequently, the yam 36 is wound to a package 21.<br>
It is thus possible to crimp a flat feed yarn by the basic method.<br>
To produce a novelty yam, the feed module 3 may optionally be equipped with additional processing units, as are scliematically shown, for example, in Figure 2. In this connection, Figure 2.1 shows the feed module without additional processing units, and Figure 2.2 the feed module 3 with addhional processing units. The feed module 3, which can be formed, for example, by a support plate 27, mounts withdrawal roll system 10. To this end, the guide roll 24.1 is rotatably mounted on support plate 27. In spaced relationship with guide roll 24, the support plate 27 mounts godet 23T with a godet drive 25 arranged on the opposite side thereof The godet drive 25, which may be, for example, an electric motor, drives godet 23.1, with the yarn being guided by looping godet 23.1 and guide roll 24.1 several times. The support plate 27 includes a plurality of receiving devices 28.1, 28.2, and 28.3. Figure 2.1 shows receiving devices 28.1-28.? without processing units, which corresponds to the state of the feed module 3 for producing a standard yam, and Figure 2.2 with additional processing units for producing a no'velty yam. As additional processing units, the receiving devices 28.1-28.3 in the support plate 27 of feed module 3 accommodate a feed roll system 29 and a draw pin 32. A guide roll 30 and a godet 31 form the feed roll system 29. The godet 31 connects to a godet drive not shown. Preferably, the draw pin 32 is heated, but may also be used unheated.<br>
The arrangement of feed module 3 as shown in Figure 2.2 illustrates the path of yarn 36, In this cormection. the yarn path of the false twist texturing machine of Figure 1 could be composed, as follows: The withdrawal roll system 10 withdraws the yam 36 from feed yam package 8. From withdrawal roll system 10, the yam 36 advances into a first draw zone, which extends between godet 23.1 of withdrawal roll system 10 and godet 30 of feed roll system 29. Within the draw zone, a heated draw pin 32 is arranged. This draw pin 32 could be heated to a surface temperature from 80°C to 160°C. The yam loops about draw pin 32, and is withdrawn by feed roll system 29. In the case that the yarn is to loop draw pin 32 only partially, the draw pin<br><br>
32 could be associated with a yam guide, which would be variable in its position for adjusting a certain looping angle on draw pin 32.<br>
From feed roll system 29, the thus predrawn yam advances into the false twist zone. The further yam path corresponds to that of the false twist texturing machine that has been described above with reference to Figure 1. A corresponding adjustment of the yam tension in the draw zone makes it possible to produce advantageous effects in the yarn, which show as thin/thick places after the crimping.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates further embodiments of a feed module 3, as could be used in the false twist texturing machine shown in Figure 1.<br>
In Figure 3.1, the feed module 3 comprises for each processing station, a withdrawal roll system 10, a further feed roll system 29 and a package feed device 33 with a yam guide 34. Each of the additional processing units is likewise held in a receiving device on support plate 27. For further processing units, the support plate 27 includes receiving devices 28.4 and 28.5<br>
The embodiment of feed module 3 as shown in Figure 3.1 is especially suited for producing a combination yam, for example, from a crimped yam and an elastic yam. To this end, the withdrawal roll system 10 withdraws the yam 36 and advances it to the false twist zone. Tlie feed roil system 29 withdraws a second yarn 37 from a feed yarn package 35 via yarn guide 34. To this end, the feed yam package 35 is arranged on package feed device 34. Subsequently, the yam 37 could be guided outside the false twist zone as far as an entanglement device, which could be arranged preferably downstream of the draw roll system 14 of the false twist texturing machine shown in Figure 1. Once the yam 37 is combined with the crimped yam 36, the thus-formed combination yam is wound to a package. Before that, it would be possible co advance the combination yam through the second heater for a heat treatment.<br>
Figure 3.2 shows a further embodiment of a feed module 3, which comprises the withdrawal roll system 10 and a further feed roll system 29. Both feed roll systems comprise each a guide roll and a godet. Between the feed roll systems 10 and 29, a receiving device in the support plate 27 of feed module 3 supports an entanglement device 38. The entanglement device 38 connects to a source of compressed air (not shown), so that a compressed air current entangles the yarn 36 as it advances through<br><br>
a yam channel. This pretreatment of the yam 36 prior to the false twist crimping leads to an improvement in the buikiness of the yam in its crimped state.<br>
It is possible to combine the embodiments of the feed modules shown in Figures 2 and 3 in any form. In this connection, there exists the possibility of arranging all processing in the therefor provided receiving devices, whereas only a part of the additional processing units are needed on the feed module 3. However, it is also possible that the feed module 3 is provided only with the processing units, which are needed for producing the particular yam. In this cormection, it is also possible that the feed module 3 is exchangeably connected to the machine frame.<br>
The false twist texturing machine of the present invention may also be further developed in such a manner that the processing module 2, which faces feed module 3, also mounts receiving devices for additional processing units. In this cormection, it would be possible that in each processing station, a processing module 2 mounts, for example, an additional false twist unit for joining two crimped yams to a combination yam.<br>
Figure 4 schematically illustrates a further embodiment of a false twist texturing machine according to the invention. Both the setup of the machine frame and the arrangement of the processing units of the processing module are substantially identical with the foregoing embodiment of Figure I. To this extent, the foregoing description with reference to Figure 1 is herewith incorporated by reference, and at this point reference is made only to the differences.<br>
In the false twist texturing machine shown in Figure 4, a feed module 3 is used, which is constructed according the embodiment of Figure 3.1. Besides withdrawal roll system 10, the feed module 3 mounts package feed device 33 with a feed yam package 35, on which a yam 37 is wound. From feed yarn package 35, a feed roll system 29 unwinds the yarn 37 via yam guide 34. The feed roll system 29 comprises a godet31 and a guide roll not shown. Thegodet 31 is driven via the godet drive 25.<br>
The withdrawal roll system 10 on feed module 3 withdraws a further yam 36 from one of the feed yam packages 8 and advances it into a texturing zone. After false twist texturing the yam 36 by false twist umt 13, the two yarns 36 and 37 are combined in an entangling device downstream of false twist unit 13. To this end, the<br><br>
entangling device 38 is arranged on processing module 2 between draw roll system 14 and an additional feed roll system 39 upstream of set roll system 15. The additional feed roll system 39 is advantageously used to adjust yarn tensions, which are required for combining the two yarns 36 and 37.<br>
Subsequently, the combination yarn formed of yarns 36 and 37 advances via the set roll system 15 through secondary heater 16 and by means of feed roll system 17 to the takeup device 18.<br>
However, the embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention as shown in Figure 4 may also be used for false twist texturing a yam without providing a second yam. To this end, the feed roll system 29 and package feed device 33 on feed module 3 could be omitted, whereas it is not necessary to exchange the entangling device 38 and the second feed roll system 39 on processing module 2. In this process, the yam 36 is entangled before the second heat treatment.<br>
The embodiments of the false twist texturing machine shown in Figures 1 and 2 are exemplary in their construction and setup. Basically, it is possible to drive the feed roll systems each individually or in groups. Instead of the godets, it is also possible to use convendonal nip-type feed roll systems. Essential is the arrangement of the additional processing units in the feed module in the inlet region of the false twist texturing machine. The flexible configuration and construction of the feed module with additional processing units increases the use of such false twist texturing machines considerably. Costly conversion measures are no longer needed.<br><br>
