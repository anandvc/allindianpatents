				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>GLAZING ASSEMBLY PROVIDED WITH A THIN-FILM MULTILAYER<br>
THAT REFLECTS INFRARED RADIATION AND/OR SOLAR RADIATION<br>
The invention relates to transparent substrates, preferably rigid substrates<br>
of the glass type, which are provided with thin-film multilayers that include at least<br>
one layer of metallic behavior that can act on solar radiation and/or long-<br>
wavelength infrared radiation for the purpose of forming glazing assemblies.<br>
The invention relates to multilayers, comprising alternations of silver-based<br>
layers and layers made of a transparent dielectric material of the oxide or metal or<br>
nitride compound type, allowing the glazing assemblies to have solar-protection or<br>
low-emissivity properties (double glazing for buildings, laminated windshields for<br>
vehicles, etc.). It relates more particularly to glass substrates that are provided<br>
with such multilayers and have to undergo conversion operations involving a heat<br>
treatment at 500°C or higher: these may especially be a toughening treatment, an<br>
annealing treatment or a bending treatment.<br>
Rather than deposit the layers on the glass after its heat treatment (which<br>
poses problems that increase the manufacturing costs), it was firstly sought to<br>
adapt the multilayers so that they are able to undergo such treatments while still<br>
maintaining most of their thermal properties. The object was therefore to prevent<br>
the functional layers, especially the silver layers, from deteriorating. One solution,<br>
disclosed in patent EP-506 507, consists in protecting the silver layers by flanking<br>
them with metal layers for protecting the silver layers adjacent the dielectric oxide<br>
layers. This therefore is a bendable or toughable multilayer insofar as it is just as<br>
effective in reflecting infrared or solar radiation after the bending treatment or<br>
toughening treatment as before said treatment. However, oxidation and<br>
modification of the layers that have protected the silver layers from the effect of<br>
heat, result in the optical properties of the multilayer being substantially modified,<br>
especially resulting in an increase in light transmission and a change in the<br>
colorimetric response in reflection. Furthermore, this heating also tends to create<br>
optical defects, namely pits and/or various small impairments resulting in a<br>
significant level of haze (the expression "small impairments" is generally<br>
understood to mean defects having a size of less than 5 microns, whereas "pits"<br>
are understood to mean defects larger in size than 50 microns, especially between<br>
50 and 100 microns, with the possibility, of course, of also having defects of<br>
intermediate size, i.e. between 5 and 50 microns).<br>
Secondly, it was therefore attempted to develop such thin-film multilayers<br>
that are capable of preserving both their thermal properties and their optical<br>
properties after heat treatment, while still minimizing the appearance of optical<br>
defects. The challenge was thus to produce thin-film multilayers of fixed<br>
optical/thermal properties, whether or not they are to undergo heat treatments.<br>
A first solution was proposed in patent EP-718 250. It recommends using,<br>
on top of the silver-based functional layer or layers, oxygen barrier diffusion layers,<br>
especially those based on silicon nitride, and placing the silver layers directly on<br>
the subjacent dielectric coating, without interposition of priming layers or protective<br>
metal layers. It proposes multilayers of the Si3N4/ZnO/Ag/Nb/ZnO/Si3N4 or<br>
SnO2/ZnO/Ag/Nb/Si3N4 type. An Si3N4/Nb/Ag/Nb/Si3N4 multilayer is also described<br>
in that document.<br>
A second solution was proposed in patent EP-847 965; this is directed more<br>
toward multilayers that include two silver layers, and it describes the use both of a<br>
barrier layer on top of the silver layers (as previously) and of an absorbent or<br>
stabilizing layer that is adjacent said silver layers and allows them to be stabilized.<br>
It describes multilayers of the following type:<br>
SnO2/ZnO/Ag/Nb/Si3N4/ZnO/Ag/Nb/WO3 or ZnO or SnO2/Si3N4.<br>
It should be noted in both solutions that there is a metal layer, in this case<br>
made of niobium, on the silver layers, preventing the silver layers from coming into<br>
contact with an oxidizing or nitriding reactive atmosphere during deposition by<br>
reactive sputtering of the ZnO layer or Si3N4 layer, respectively.<br>
Another publication relating to multilayers containing one or two silver<br>
layers, with adjusted optical properties without a major change in the optical<br>
behavior in the event of heat treatment is the document WO-02/48065. This<br>
describes multilayers in which at least one layer absorbent in the visible is inserted<br>
between two dielectric layers, for example of the following type:<br>
Si3N4 / ZnO / Ag / ZnO / Si3N4 / TiN or NbN / Si3N4 / ZnO / Ag / ZnO / Si3N4<br>
or<br>
Si3N4 / ZnO / Ag / Ti / ZnO / TiN / Si3N4 / ZnO / Ag / Ti / ZnO / TiN / Si3N4.<br>
Document WO 01/40131 describes laminated glazing assemblies or<br>
insulating glazing units of the low-emissivity type, that are capable of withstanding<br>
a heat treatment in such a way that the treated glazing has an appearance similar<br>
to or compatible with the untreated glazing: the treated and untreated glazing<br>
assemblies may be fitted together in a glazed system forming a homogeneous unit<br>
relatively uniform to the naked eye (what is called "matchable" glazing). This<br>
relatively small change in property of the multilayer as a result of the heat<br>
treatment is characterized by a change in colorimetric response in reflection, AE,<br>
of less than about 5 (where ?E = (?L*2 + ?a*2 + ?b*2)½) and a change ?a* of less<br>
than about 0.8.<br>
Such glazing assemblies are provided with a multilayer comprising, starting<br>
from the glass, a silicon nitride layer, an essentially thin metal layer based on<br>
nickel or nickel alloy (1 to 2 nm in thickness), a silver layer, a thin essentially<br>
metallic layer (1-2 nm) based on nickel or nickel alloy, and a silicon nitride layer.<br>
However, the relatively small change in colorimetric response is<br>
accompanied by an increase of at least 4% in the light transmission (change in<br>
light transmission ?TL = 4%, especially 5%) with in particular a TL initially within the<br>
63 to 73% range, but after heat treatment within the 68 to 78% range. A change in<br>
light transmission of this order of magnitude is far from being an advantage from<br>
the standpoint of combining, side by side, an untreated glazing assembly with a<br>
thermally treated glazing assembly, since the difference in appearance between<br>
the two is clearly detectable by the naked eye.<br>
Document WO 97/48649 also describes a multilayer of the above type that<br>
can be toughened, with two thin metal "blocking" layers, this time based on<br>
niobium, with a thickness of 0.7 to 2 nm.<br>
When this glazing assembly is connected to a toughening heat treatment,<br>
the appearance of an intense uniform haze, and also corrosion spots, are<br>
observed.<br>
These two prior solutions, which rely on the use of a metal "blocking"<br>
underlayer and overlayer, made from the same metal, therefore have significant<br>
drawbacks.<br>
The object of the invention is to alleviate these drawbacks by seeking to<br>
improve the thin-film multilayers described above, especially by seeking to<br>
improve their behavior with regard to heat treatments of the bending and/or<br>
toughening type, in particular as regards optical changes and the appearance of<br>
optical defects.<br>
The subject of the invention is a glazing assembly comprising at least one<br>
transparent substrate, especially made of glass, provided with a thin-film multilayer<br>
comprising, in the following order starting from the substrate, at least:<br>
(a) a first dielectric layer;<br>
(b) a lower stabilizing layer made of a metal or metal alloy X;<br>
(c) a functional layer having reflection properties in the infrared and/or in the solar<br>
radiation, especially a metal layer;<br>
(d) an upper metal blocking layer made of a metal or metal alloy Y;<br>
(e) a second dielectric layer; and<br>
(f) optionally, a protective oxide layer;<br>
in which multilayer the metal or alloy X of the lower stabilizing layer is different<br>
from the metal or alloy Y of the upper blocking layer.<br>
Although the prior art teaches, unambiguously, how to protect the functional<br>
layer by flanking it between two metal layers b and d of identical nature, the<br>
inventors of the present invention have demonstrated a very substantial<br>
improvement in the resistance to heat treatment as regards the optical properties<br>
of the glazing assembly when two different metals are chosen to form said layers b<br>
and d.<br>
According to the present invention, it is considered that an alloy of two or<br>
more metals is a different material from each of the constituent metals in the pure<br>
state. However, it may be preferable for an alloy layer to contain only metals<br>
different from the associated second metal layer. Moreover, it will be considered<br>
that two alloys are different if they do not have the same quantitative or qualitative<br>
composition; however, it will be preferable for at least one metal to differ between<br>
these alloys, or even for each alloy to be based on different metals.<br>
The improvement obtained according to the invention is a slight optical<br>
variation characterized by a change in light transmission ?TL of at most 3% and/or<br>
a change in the colorimetric response in external reflection ?E* between the case<br>
before heat treatment and the case after heat treatment of at most 3, with neither<br>
haze nor pitting.<br>
The combination of good optical quality and of limited optical changes is<br>
obtained by the judicious choice of different metal layers. One explanatory<br>
hypothesis is based on the observation that the wetting of a metal drop A on a<br>
metal layer X will be different from the wetting of X on A. This effect is due to<br>
different surface energies in the case of A and X. It is therefore judicious to choose<br>
the metals X and Y so as to obtain the best wetting on either side of the silver (or<br>
other) functional layer so as to have the best adhesion and to obtain maximum<br>
protection during the heat treatment.<br>
The first dielectric layer (a) comprises an oxygen diffusion barrier layer<br>
chosen from silicon nitrides, optionally containing at least one other metal, such as<br>
aluminum.<br>
This dielectric layer essentially has the function of blocking the diffusion of<br>
oxygen into the multilayer, including at high temperature. Since nitrides are largely<br>
inert when exposed to an oxidizing attack, they undergo no appreciable structural<br>
modification or chemical modification (of the oxidative type) during a heat<br>
treatment of the toughening type, and therefore cause virtually no optical<br>
modification of the multilayer in the event of heat treatment, especially in terms of<br>
light transmission level. This layer may also act as a diffusion barrier preventing<br>
species from migrating from the glass, especially alkali metals. Furthermore,<br>
thanks to its refractive index of about 2, it is readily placed in a multilayer of the<br>
low-emissivity type.<br>
This layer may generally be deposited with a thickness of at least 5 nm,<br>
especially at least 10 nm, for example between 15 and 70 nm, especially around<br>
30 to 60 nm.<br>
The lower metal layer (b) may be made of a metal X chosen from titanium,<br>
nickel, chromium, niobium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum or a metal alloy<br>
containing at least one of these metals. Among such choices, a nickel chromium<br>
alloy proves to be particularly satisfactory.<br>
Advantageously, the thickness of the layer (b) is chosen with a sufficient<br>
value for the metal layer to oxidize only partly during a heat treatment, such as the<br>
toughening treatment. Preferably, this thickness is less than or equal to 6 nm,<br>
between 1 and 6 nm and preferably at least 1.5 nm.<br>
A lower metal chosen from metals that have a low affinity for oxygen makes<br>
it possible to limit the diffusion of residual oxygen through the silver layer and<br>
helps to prevent the appearance of defects of the haze or pitting type. Since the<br>
lower metal barely oxidizes at all during the heat treatment, its thickness is<br>
advantageously chosen in such a way that most of the light absorption by the<br>
multilayer is provided by this metal.<br>
The functional layer (c) is typically a silver layer, but the invention applies in<br>
the same way to other layers of reflective metals, such as silver alloys, especially<br>
those containing titanium or palladium, or layers based on gold or copper. Its<br>
thickness is especially from 5 to 13 nm, preferably around 6 to 12 nm.<br>
The upper metal layer (d) may be made of a metal Y chosen from titanium,<br>
nickel, chromium, niobium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum and metal alloys<br>
containing at least one of these metals, different from the metal or alloy X of the<br>
layer (b). Advantageously, the metal Y is chosen from titanium, niobium, aluminum<br>
and zirconium; it is preferably titanium.<br>
Advantageously, the thickness of the layer (d) is chosen with a value<br>
sufficient for the metal layer to oxidize only partly during a heat treatment, such as<br>
toughening. Preferably, this thickness is less than or equal to 6 nm, it may be as<br>
thin as about 0.4 nm and in particular lies within the range of around 0.4 to 4 nm.<br>
An upper metal chosen from metals with a high affinity for oxygen<br>
furthermore makes it possible to block the diffusion of oxygen through the<br>
multilayer and therefore to provide effective protection of the functional silver layer.<br>
However, this oxidation of the upper metal causes a change in the light<br>
transmission ATl, and the maximum thickness of the upper metal layer (d) may be<br>
chosen so as to limit this change.<br>
When the lower layer (b) is made of a barely oxidizable metal, such as<br>
nickel-chromium, and the upper layer (d) is made of a metal with a high affinity for<br>
oxygen, such as titanium, niobium or zirconium, the thickness of the lower metal<br>
layer (b) is advantageously chosen so as to be greater than that of the overlayer<br>
(d). Choosing the thicknesses of the metal layers in this way makes it possible to<br>
reduce the change in light transmission even more effectively.<br>
Advantageously, the functional layer (c), typically made of silver, is in direct<br>
contact with the metal coatings (d) and (b) placed above and below it.<br>
The second dielectric layer (e) has a function similar to that of the layer (a).<br>
It comprises an oxygen diffusion barrier layer chosen from silicon nitrides,<br>
optionally containing at least one other metal such as aluminum, etc.<br>
This layer may generally be deposited with a thickness of at least 5 nm,<br>
especially at least 10 nm, for example between 15 and 70 nm. especially around<br>
30 to 60 nm. It may in particular have a thickness greater than that of the first<br>
dielectric layer (a).<br>
Advantageously, at least one (in particular each) of the dielectric coatings<br>
may comprise a layer based on one or more metal oxides. In particular, the upper<br>
dielectric layer (e) may comprise, on its outer surface, an oxide layer (f) that<br>
improves the scratch resistance of the multilayer.<br>
It may be a layer based on zinc oxide or on a mixed oxide consisting of zinc<br>
and another metal (of the Al type). It may also be based on oxides comprising at<br>
least one of the following metals: Al, Ti, Sn, Zr, Nb, W, Ta. An example of a zinc-<br>
based mixed oxide which can be deposited as a thin film according to the<br>
invention is a mixed zinc tin oxide containing an additional element such as<br>
antimony, as described in WO 00/24686.<br>
The thickness of this oxide layer may be from 0.5 to 6 nm.<br>
One nonlimiting embodiment of the invention consists in providing a<br>
multilayer comprising, on glass, the following sequence:<br>
.../silicon nitride/nickel chromium/Ag/titanium/silicon nitride/...<br>
(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)<br>
the silicon nitride possibly containing another element, of the Al type, in a minor<br>
amount relative to Si.<br>
In particular, the multilayer may comprise the double sequence<br>
(a)/(b)/(c)/(d)/(e)/(a')/(b')/(c')/(d')/(e'), where a' is identical to or different from a, and<br>
likewise in the case of b, b' c, c' d, d' and e, e', and in which the intermediate<br>
dielectric layers (e) and (a') may merge as a single layer of the same dielectric.<br>
This variant is illustrated by the multilayer, on glass: .../silicon nitride/nickel-<br>
chromium/silver/titanium/silicon nitride/ nickel-chromium/silver/titanium/silicon<br>
nitride.<br>
As a variant, it is possible to associate with the silicon nitride layers, for<br>
example, an oxide layer (SnO2, a mixed zinc tin oxide, etc.), reducing the<br>
thickness of the silicon nitride layer accordingly.<br>
The multilayer configuration according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
eliminate essentially all the optical defects, especially defects of the haze or pitting<br>
type, on the thin-film multilayer after heat treatment.<br>
The coated substrates according to the invention have, when they are fitted<br>
as a double-glazing unit with another substrate, a light transmission of between 40<br>
and 70%, especially from 40 to 60%, and a selectivity of between 1.25 and 1.45,<br>
especially around 1.4 (the selectivity being the light transmission/solar factor ratio,<br>
where the solar factor is the ratio of the total energy entering a room through the<br>
glazing assembly to the incident solar energy according to the Parry Moon<br>
calculation for an air mass equal to 2).<br>
They have a color in external reflection in the blue-green shades.<br>
They may undergo heat treatments at a temperature of at least 100°C,<br>
especially about 130°C, for the purpose of assembling a laminated glass, or more<br>
than 500°C for the purpose of bending, toughening or annealing in particular (even<br>
bending treatments that differ from one point on the substrate to another), while<br>
maintaining a high light absorption even after toughening. This small optical<br>
variation is characterized by a light transmission change ATL (measured under<br>
illuminant D6s) between the case before bending and after bending of at most 3%,<br>
especially at most 2 to 2.5%, in particular at most 2%, and/or a change in<br>
colorimetric response in reflection ?E* between the case before bending and after<br>
bending of at most 3, especially at most 2.5, where ?E* is expressed, in the<br>
(L,a*,b*) colorimetry system, as follows: ?E* = (?L*2 + ?a*2 + ?b*2)y'.<br>
The generally accepted criterion of toughenability in terms of change of<br>
colorimetric response in external reflection is that ?E* between the case before<br>
heat treatment and after heat treatment must be less than or equal to 2. However,<br>
it appears that a slightly higher value than 2 (but less than 3) is acceptable from<br>
the standpoint of the combined use of toughened and nontoughened volumes on<br>
one and the same curtain wall, if this change in colorimetric response is<br>
accompanied by a reasonable reduction in the level of reflection, preferably a<br>
change in absolute value limited to 2 (l?Rextl = 2), in particular a change of at most<br>
1.5 (l?Rextl = 15).<br>
Double glazing units thus formed also exhibit a small change in colorimetric<br>
response between normal incidence and non-normal incidence, both in the initial<br>
state and in the toughened state.<br>
The coated substrate may be used as laminated glazing, it being possible<br>
for the multilayer to be placed beside the intermediate film within the laminated<br>
assembly on the side facing the outside of the space defined by the glazing<br>
assembly (face 2) or on the inside of the space defined by the glazing assembly<br>
(face 3). In such a glazing assembly at least one substrate may be toughened or<br>
hardened, especially the one bearing the multilayer. The coated substrate may<br>
also be combined with at least one other glass pane via a gas space in order to<br>
make an insulating multiple glazing (double glazing) unit. In this case, the<br>
multilayer preferably faces the intermediate gas space (face 2). A double glazing<br>
unit according to the invention may incorporate at least one laminated glass pane.<br>
Advantageously, once the substrate has been provided with the thin-film<br>
multilayer, it undergoes a heat treatment at more than 500°C in order to toughen it,<br>
with, after toughening, a color in external reflection characterized by a* 
b*
The present invention also relates to a glazed unit incorporating several<br>
glazing assemblies according to the invention and especially to a glazed assembly<br>
incorporating at least one glazing assembly that has undergone a heat treatment<br>
and at least one glazing assembly that has not undergone heat treatment.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail by means of the<br>
nonlimiting examples that follow.<br>
In all the following examples, the layers are deposited by magnetically<br>
enhanced sputtering on a clear silica-soda-lime glass pane 4 mm in thickness of<br>
the PLANILUX type (glass sold by Saint-Gobain Glass).<br>
The silicon-nitride-based layers are deposited from Al-doped Si targets in a<br>
nitriding atmosphere. The Ag-based layers are deposited from Ag targets in an<br>
inert atmosphere and the Ti-based layers from a Ti target, also in an inert<br>
atmosphere. The NiCr layers are deposited in an inert atmosphere from nickel-<br>
chromium alloy targets in portions of 80/20 by weight.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 and 2<br>
These examples relate to a multilayer:<br>
Glass/AI:Si3N4/NiCr/Ag/Ti/AI:Si3N4,<br>
where AI:Si3N4 means that the nitride contains aluminum.<br>
Table 1 below repeats the multilayer, with the thicknesses indicated in<br>
nanometers for each of the two examples:<br>
These coated glass assemblies were subjected to a toughening operation<br>
at above 600°C.<br>
The overall optical quality of the glass after heat treatment was evaluated<br>
by observing if any defects, whether localized or not, of the pitting or haze type<br>
appeared. The glazing assembly was aluminated with an intense light coming, for<br>
example, from a halogen spot. A qualitative rating was assigned according to the<br>
following parameters:<br>
The change in appearance of the glass panes before and after the heat<br>
treatment was then evaluated by measuring the change in light transmission ?TL<br>
and the level of reflection as a percentage (averaged change; under illuminant D65;<br>
standard observer at 2°) and the change in appearance AE* (a unitless quantity,<br>
the formula for which was mentioned above) in external reflection, internal<br>
reflection and in transmission. These values, and the light transmission values T<br>
(again under illuminant D65 at 2°) in %, of external light reflection Rext and internal<br>
light reflection Rint, also in %, the values of I*, a* and b* in external reflection and<br>
internal reflection (a unitless quantities), the dominant wavelength and the purity in<br>
transmission, and also the solar factor SF (Parry Moon, mass 2) are given in<br>
Tables 2 and 3 below.<br>
The optical changes were measured on double glazing units comprising a 6<br>
mm thick substrate according to the invention, the substrate being separated by a<br>
12 mm thick argon space, the multilayer-coated surface of the substrate according<br>
to the invention being turned toward the associated substrate.<br>
The light transmission and reflections were measured using an integrating-<br>
sphere measurement apparatus that measures the light flux in all directions on<br>
one side of the substrate or on the other.<br>
The multilayer according to Examples 1 and 2 after toughening exhibits very<br>
good optical quality with no haze or corrosion pitting, receiving the rating +++.<br>
The colorimetric behavior of the glazing assembly demonstrates a relatively<br>
small change with regard to the angle of incidence, as indicated in Table 4 below<br>
which presents the change in appearance in external reflection for various angles<br>
of incidence, this change being calculated between toughened and nontoughened<br>
Moreover, a* and b* vary only slightly with the angle of incidence, and also<br>
in the direction of limiting the change in appearance when the observer moves<br>
away from normal incidence, so that the toughenability criteria are even better<br>
satisfied. This is an appreciable advantage, especially for the production of large<br>
glazed units for which it is desirable to see the same color at all angles of<br>
observation.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
This is a multilayer according to document WO 01/40131 in which the two<br>
metal blocking layers are made of nickel chromium. It is identical to Example 1,<br>
except that the Ti layer (d) is replaced with an NiCr layer 1.2 nm in thickness.<br>
When it undergoes a toughening heat treatment such as that carried out on<br>
the previous examples, this multilayer manifests a light transmission change of<br>
greater than 4%, being around 5%, which is more than twice as large as the<br>
observed change with the invention.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
This is a multilayer similar to that of Comparative Example 1, in which both<br>
metal layers (b) and (d) are made of titanium.<br>
This multilayer demonstrates, after heating, an intense uniform haze and a<br>
few corrosion pits, penalized by the — rating.<br>
The change in light transmission measured using an integrating sphere is<br>
acceptable, but it drops considerably when it is measured in the direction of<br>
incidence, owing to the strong scattering that gives the haze effect.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example according to the invention differs from Example 1 by the fact<br>
that the metal layers (b) and (d) are inverted, thus the titanium layer becomes the<br>
lower layer and the nickel-chromium layer becomes the upper layer.<br>
When this multilayer undergoes a toughening heat treatment, it results in<br>
the following optical changes:<br>
The toughened multilayer has an acceptable optical quality, but exhibits a<br>
light haze, awarded the ++ rating.<br>
Comparing this example with Example 1 shows that it is preferable to place<br>
the metal with a low affinity for oxygen as the lower layer and the metal with a high<br>
affinity for oxygen as the upper layer.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example according to the invention differs from Example 1 by the fact<br>
that the metal layer (d) is this time made of niobium with a thickness of 1.5 nm.<br>
The multilayer is the following:<br>
Glass/Si3N4(37)/NiCr(3.2)/Ag(7)/Nb(1.5)/Si3N4(54)<br>
The optical changes are given in Table 6 below.<br>
This multilayer demonstrates, after heating, a very good optical quality<br>
without any haze or corrosion pits, receiving the +++ rating.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3<br>
This is a multilayer according to document WO 97/48649 in which the two<br>
metal blocking layers are made of niobium. It is identical to Example 1 except that<br>
the layers (b) and (d) are made of Nb with a thickness of between 0.7 and 2 nm.<br>
After heating, this multilayer demonstrates an intense uniform haze and<br>
several corrosion pits, penalized by the — rating.<br>
The change in light transmission measured using an integrating sphere is<br>
acceptable, but drops considerably when it is measured in the direction of<br>
incidence, owing to the strong scattering that gives the haze effect.<br>
These examples show that by choosing two metal layers made of different<br>
metals, a very considerable improvement is made over a multilayer using the<br>
same metal or alloy, even with different thicknesses, on either side of the silver.<br>
These examples must not be regarded as describing the invention in a<br>
limiting manner, the invention also applies to multilayers using another functional<br>
layer, and also several functional layers.<br>
Of course, a person skilled in the art is capable of producing different<br>
embodiments of the invention without thereby departing from the scope of the<br>
patent as defined by the claims.<br>
