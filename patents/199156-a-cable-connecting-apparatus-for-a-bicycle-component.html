				<td>The present invention is directed to cable-controlled devices for bicycles and, more particularly, to an apparatus for connecting a cable to such a device.<br>
Many bicycle control devices such as derailleurs, brakes, etc. are operated by Bowden-type control cables wherein an inner wire slides within an outer casing. The inner wire is connected to an actuating arm or some other structure of the control device such that pulling and releasing the inner wire causes the control device to move in a desired manner. During assembly of the bicycle, the inner wire ordinarily is securely fixed between a bolt and nut that are coupled to the control device.<br>
When the control device is shipped to the bicycle assembler, the bolt and nut used to connect the inner wire to the control device usually is tightened on the control device so that the bolt and nut will not loosen and become separated from the control device during shipping. When the bolt and nut are separated from the control device, the chances are very great that the bolt and nut will become lost, thus causing much delay while a suitable replacement is located and installed. Unfortunately, when the bolt and nut are tightened to prevent such loss, the bolt and nut must be loosened during assembly so that the irmer wire can be placed in the proper position, and then the bolt and nut must be retightened to affix the inner wire to the control device. The loosening step creates extra steps for the assembly process and significantly slows down the assembly line.<br>
The present invention is directed to a cable connecting apparatus for a bicycle component wherein a nut and bolt used to fix a cable to a bicycle component are securely fixed together to avoid loosening during shipping, but the nut and bolt do not need to be<br><br>
loosened when the cable is affixed to the component. In one embodiment of the present invention, a cable connecting mechanism for a bicycle component includes a cable connecting<br>
unit having a fastener opening and a fastener disposed in the fastener opening. The fastener includes a head and a shank including a locking portion disposed in the fastener opening and a threaded portion disposed between the head and the locking portion so that a space for receiving a cable therein is formed between the locking portion and the head. A locking member (e.g., an adhesive) is disposed at the locking portion of the fastener for locking the faster to the cable connecting unit.<br>
In a more specific embodiment, the fastener opening has a threaded inner peripheral<br>
surface, and the locking member is disposed between the locking portion of the fastener and the threaded inner peripheral surface. In an even more specific embodiment, the cable<br>
connecting unit includes a cable connecting member and a nut disposed at a first side of the cable connecting member, wherein the nut forms the fastener opening. If desired, the head<br>
may be disposed at a second side of the cable connecting member, wherein the second side is opposite the first side, and the space is disposed at the second side of the cable connecting member. In this case, the cable is sandwiched between the fastener head and the cable<br>
connecting member. Alternatively, the space may be disposed at the first side of the cable<br>
connecting member so that the cable may be sandwiched between the nut and the cable connecting member. To facilitate assembly, the fastener may include a rotation inhibiting<br>
fastener portion having a rotation inhibiting shape, and the cable connecting member may include a rotation inhibiting engaging portion engaging with the rotation inhibiting fastener portion so that the fastener remains rotationally stationary during assembly. In other words, only the nut needs to be turned to clamp the cable to the nut and bolt.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is an oblique view of a front derailleur 10 that includes a particular embodiment of a cable connecting apparatus 14 according to the present invention, and Figure 2 is an oblique view of derailleur 10 assembled to a bicycle frame tube 18. Derailleur 10 includes a base member 22 having a clamp band 26 (Figure 3) for attaching derailleur 10 the bicycle frame tube 18 in a well-known manner; a movable member 30 supporting a chain guide 34, and a linkage mechanism 38 coupled between base member 22 and movable member 30 so that movable member 30 can move laterally relative to bicycle frame tube 18.<br><br>
As shown in Figures 1-3, linkage mechanism 38 includes a link 42 pivotably connected to base member 22 through a pivot pin 46 and pivotably connected to movable member 30" through a pivot pin 50; a link 54 pivotably connected to base member 22 through a pivot pin 58, and a link 61 pivotably connected to link 54 through pivot pin 59 and pivotably connected to link 42 and movable member 30 through pivot pin 50. A cable connecting member in the form of an actuating arm 62 is integrally attached to link 54 so that movement of actuating arm 62 clockwise in Figures 1 and 2 causes chain guide 34 to move laterally outwardly from bicycle frame tube 18, and movement of actuating and 62 counterclockwise causes chain guide 34 to move laterally inwardly towards bicycle frame tube 18. Movement of actuating arm 62, and hence chain guide 34, is controlled by a cable 66 affixed to actuating arm 62 in a manner described below. The general structure and operation of derailleur 10, except for the cable connecting apparatus 14, is well known, so a further detailed description of these conventional aspects of derailleur 10 will be omitted.<br>
Figures 1 and 3 show derailleur 10 in a state suitable for shipment, and Figure 4 is a detailed partial cross sectional view of cable connecting apparatus 14 in this state.

This may be accomplished by using an adhesive between nut 95 and the first side 96 of actuating arm 62, buy welding nut 95 to actuating arm 62, by forming nut 95 as a<br><br>
hexagon wherein opposite sides of nut 95 contact opposite walls of nut housing 97, or by some other method. As a result, head 82 and space 94 are disposed at an opposite second side 99 of actuating arm 62.<br>
A locking member 98 is disposed at locking portion 86 of bolt 78 between the threaded fastener opening 74 and locking portion 86 for locking bolt 78 to nut 95 and hence to cable connecting unit 70. Locking member 98 may be an adhesive such as DRYLOCK (tm) or any other structure which prevents bolt 78 from loosening from cable connecting unit 70 during shipping but which allows bolt 78 to turn during assembly.<br>
When cable 66 is to be affixed to cable connecting apparatus 14, cable 66 is placed in space 94, a tool is engaged with tool engaging hole 100, and bolt 78 is rotated to cause head 82 to move toward the second side 99 of actuating arm 62. In this embodiment, a washer 104<br>
is disposed around bolt 78 between locking portion 86 and head 82 for pressing against cable 66 as shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 is an oblique view of a front derailleur 120 that includes an alternative embodiment of a cable connecting apparatus according to the present invention. This embodiment is the same as the first embodiment shown in Figure 1 except for an alternative embodiment of a cable connecting apparatus 114, so the identical components are numbered<br>

portion 186 disposed in fastener opening 174 and an exposed threaded portion 190 disposed between head 182 and locking portion 186 so that a space 194 is formed between locking portion 186 and head 182. In this embodiment, cable connecting unit 170 includes an actuating arm 162 and a nut 195 disposed directly adjacent to a first side 196 of actuating arm<br><br>
162, wherein nut 195 has a threaded inner peripheral surface which forms fastener opening 174 and mates with threaded portion 190 of bolt 178. As a result, head 182 and space 194 are<br>
disposed at an opposite second side 199 of actuating arm 162. As with the first embodiment, a locking member 198 is disposed at locking portion 186 of bolt 178 between the threaded fastener opening 174 and locking portion 186 for locking bolt 178 to nut 195 and hence to cable connecting unit 170.<br>
In this embodiment, head 182 of bolt 178 includes a rotation inhibiting fastener<br>
portion 121, and actuating arm 162 includes a rotation inhibiting engaging portion in the form of tabs 131 that project from second surface 199 and engage with the rotation inhibiting fastener portion 121. Tabs 131 define a slot 133 for receiving cable 66 there through. In general, rotation inhibiting fastener portion 121 has a rotation inhibiting shape when viewed along a longitudinal axis X of bolt 178. In this embodiment, rotation inhibiting fastener portion 121 has a flat shape. Also, bolt 178 includes a collar 141 disposed on shank 183 between locking portion 186 and head 182 (e.g., directly adjacent head 182). Collar 141 includes a flat rotation inhibiting portion 145 which engages with a flat portion of a collar opening 143 to enhance stability of the assembled structure.<br>
When cable 66 is to be affixed to cable connecting apparatus 114, cable 66 is placed in space 194, and a tool is engaged with nut 195. Nut 195 is rotated with the tool to cause head 182 to move toward the second side 199 of actuating arm 162 without rotating bolt 178 as a result of the engagement between rotation inhibiting fastener portion 121 on head 182 and tabs 131 extending from actuating arm 162. In the assembles state, head 182 presses against cable 66 as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Figure 9 is an oblique view of a rear derailleur 210 that includes a particular embodiment of a cable connecting apparatus 214 according to the present invention.
