COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVE OF THE FORMULA I"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The invention concerns certain novel quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-tumour activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for cell proliferation diseases such as psoriasis and cancer utilise compounds which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to cells generally but their toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to anti-tumour agents which act by mechanisms other than<br><br>
the inhibition of DNA synthesis have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action. In recent years it has been discovered that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene i.e. a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumour cells (Bradshaw, Mutagenesis, 1986,1,91). Several such oncogenes give rise to the production of peptides which are receptors for growth factors. Activation of the growth factor receptor complex subsequently leads to an increase in cell proliferation. It is known, for example, that several oncogenes encode tyrosine kinase enzymes and that certain growth factor receptors are also tyrosine kinase enzymes (Yarden et al, Ann. Rev. Biochem.. 1988, 57,443; Larsen et al, Ann. Reports in Med. Chem., 1989, Chpt. 13). The first group of tyrosine kinases to be identified arose from such viral oncogenes, for example pp60v"Src tyrosine kinase (otherwise known as v-Src), and the corresponding tyrosine kinases in normal cells, for example pp60c"Src tyrosine kinase (otherwise known as c~Src).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are important in the transmission of biochemical signals which initiate cell replication.. They are large enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Various classes of receptor tyrosine kinases are known (Wilks, Advances in Cancer Research. 1993, 60,43-73) based on families of growth factors which bind to different receptor tyrosine kinases. The classification<br><br>
includes Class I receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF, TGFa, Neu and erbB receptors, Class II receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the insulin family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin and IGFI receptors and insulin-related receptor (IRR) and Class HI receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the PDGFa, PDGFP and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptors.<br>
It is also known that certain tyrosine kinases belong to the class of non-receptor tyrosine kinases which are located intracellularly and are involved in the transmission of biochemical signals such as those that influence tumour cell motility, dissemination and invasiveness and subsequently metastatic tumour growth (Ullrich et al, Cell, 1990, 61,203-212, Bolen et al, FASEB J., 1992, 6, 3403-3409, Brickell et al, Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis. 1992, 3,401-406, Bohlen et al, Oncogene, 1993, 8, 2025-2031, Courtneidge et al, Semin. Cancer Biol.. 1994, 5, 239-246, Lauffenburger et al, Cell, 1996, 84. 359-369, Hanks et al.,BioEssays, 1996,19,137-145, Parsons et al, Current Opinion in Cell Biology, 1997, 9,187-192, Brown et al, Biochimica et Biophvsica Acta. 1996, 1287.121-149 and Schlaepfer et al, Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology, 1999, 71,435-478). Various classes of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are known including the Src family such as the Src, Lyn, Fyn and Yes tyrosine kinases, the Abl family such as Abl and Arg and the Jak family such as Jak 1 and Tyk 2.<br>
It is known that the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are highly regulated in normal cells and in the absence of extracellular stimuli are maintained in an inactive conformation. However, some, Src. family members, for example c-Src tyrosine kinase, is frequently significantly activated (when compared to normal cell levels) in common human :ancers such as gastrointestinal cancer, for example colon, rectal and stomach cancer (Cartwright et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990, 87, 558-562 and Mao et al, Oncogene, 1997,15_, 3083-3090), and breast cancer (Muthuswamy et al, Oncogene. 1995, H, 1801-1810). The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases has also been located in other ommon human cancers such as non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancer of the lung (Mazurenko etal, European Journal of Cancer, 1992,28, 372-7), bladder cancer (Fanning et al, Cancer Research. 1992, 52, 1457-52), oesophageal cancer (Jankowski et al, Gut, 1992, 33,1033-8), cancer of the prostate, varian cancer (Wiener et al, Clin. Cancer Research, 1999, 5, 2164-70) and pancreatic cancer<br><br>
(Lutz et al, Biochem. and Biophvs. Res. Comm.. 1998, 243, 503-8). As further human tumour tissues are tested for the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases it is expected that its widespread prevalance will be established.<br>
It is further known that the predominant role of c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is to     regulate the assembly of focal adhesion complexes through interaction with a number of cytoplasmic proteins including, for example, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. In addition c-S,rc is coupled to signalling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton which facilitates cell motility. Likewise, important roles are played by the c-Src, c-Yes and c-Fyn non-receptor tyrosine kinases in integrin mediated signalling and in disrupting cadherin-dependent cell-cell   junctions (Owens et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2000,11, 51-64 and Klinghoffer et al., EMBO Journal, 1999,18_, 2459-2471). Cellular motility is necessarily required for a localised tumour to progress through the stages of dissemination into the blood stream, invasion of other tissues and initiation of metastatic tumour growth. For example, colon tumour progression from localised to disseminated, invasive metastatic disease has been correlated    with c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase activity (Brunton et al, Oncogene, 1997,14, 283-293, Fincham et al., UMBO J, 1998,17, 81-92 and Verbeek et al., Exp. Cell Research, 1999, 248, 531-537).<br>
Accordingly it has been recognised that an inhibitor of such non-receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as a selective inhibitor of the motility of tumour cells and as a   selective inhibitor of the dissemination and invasiveness of mammalian cancer cells leading to inhibition of metastatic tumour growth. In particular an inhibitor of such non-receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as an anti-invasive agent for use in the containment and/or treatment of solid tumour disease.<br>
We have now found that surprisingly certain quinazoline derivatives possess potent    anti-tumour activity. Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of one or more of the non-receptor tyrosine-specific protein kinases that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the invasiveness and migratory ability of metastasising   tumour cells. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, for example by inhibition of one or more of c-Src, c-Yes and c-Fyn.<br><br>
It is also known that c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase enzyme is involved in the control of osteoclast-driven bone resorption (Soriano et al, Cell, 1991, 64, 693-702; Boyce et al., J. Clin. Invest.. 1992, 90, 1622-1627; Yoneda et al., J. Clin. Invest.. 1993, 91, 2791-2795 and Missbach et al., Bone. 1999,24 ,437-49). An inhibitor of c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is therefore of value in the prevention and treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, metastatic disease in bone and tumour-induced hypercalcaemia.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful in inhibiting the uncontrolled cellular proliferation which arises from various non-malignant diseases such as inflammatory diseases (for example rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease), fibrotic diseases (for example hepatic cirrhosis and lung fibrosis), glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, hypersensitivity reactions of the skin, blood vessel diseases (for example atherosclerosis and restenosis), allergic asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Generally the compounds of the present invention possess potent inhibitory activity against the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, for example by inhibition of c-Src and/or c-Yes, whilst possessing less potent inhibitory ativity against other tyrosine kinase enzymes such as the receptor tyrosine kinases, for example EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and/or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, certain compounds of the present invention, possess substantially better potency against the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, for example c-Src and/or c-Yes, than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Such compounds possess sufficient potency against the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, for example c-Src and/or c-Yes, that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit, for example, c-Src and/or c-Yes whilst demonstrating tittle-activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
It is disclosed in European Patent Application 0 566 226 that certain quinazoline derivatives inhibit the proliferation of tumour tissue by a mechanism believed to involve inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. The disclosed compounds include the 5-substituted quinazoline 5-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(3 '-methylanilmo)quinazoline.<br>
It is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,962,458 and in International Patent<br><br>
Application WO 98/13354 that certain quinazoline derivatives provide an anti-tumour effect by way of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect based on inhibition   of vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinases. The disclosures allow     for 5-substituted quinazolines but no such compounds are specifically disclosed.<br>
It is disclosed in International Patent Application WO 99/61428 that that certain quinazoline derivatives and conjugates thereof with EGF, possess anti-cancer activity, in particular potent cytotoxicity against human brain tumours. The scope of disclosure embraces   5-substituted quinazolines but no such compounds are specifically disclosed.<br>

A suitable value for (R1)m when it is a (l-3C)alkylenedioxy group is, for example, methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy and the oxygen atoms thereof occupy adjacent ring positions.<br><br>
When, as defined hereinbefore, an R1 group forms a group of the formula Q -X - and, for example, X1 is a OC(R4)2 linking group, it is the carbon atom, not the oxygen atom, of the OC(R4)2 linking group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the oxygen atom is attached to the Q3 group. Similarly, when, for example a CH3 group within a R1 substituent bears a group of the formula -X3-Q5 and, for example, X3 is a C(R7)20 linking group, it is the carbon atom, not the oxygen atom, of the C(R7)20 linking group which is attached to the CH3 group and the oxygen atom is linked to the Q5 group. A similar convention applies to the attachment of the groups of the formulae Q4-X2- and -X7-Q7.<br>
As defined hereinbefore, adjacent carbon atoms in any (2-6C)alkylene chain within a R1 substituent may be optionally separated by the insertion into the chain of a group such as O, CON(R5) or OC. For example, insertion of a OC group into the ethylene chain within a 2-morpholinoethoxy group gives rise to a 4-morpholinobut-2-ynyloxy group and, for example, insertion of a CONH group into the ethylene chain within a 3-methoxypropoxy group gives rise to, for example, a 2-(2-methoxyacetamido)ethoxy group.<br>
When, as defined hereinbefore, any CH2=CH- or HOC- group within a R1 substituent optionally bears at the terminal CH.2= or HO position a substituent such as a group of the formula Q4~X2- wherein X2 is, for example, NHCO and Q4 is a heterocyclyl-(l-6C)alkyl group, suitable R1 substituents so formed include, for example, N-[heterocyclyl-(l-6C)alkyl]carbamoylvinyl groups such as N-(2-pyrrolidin-l-ylethyl)carbamoylvinyl or N-[heterocyclyl-(l-6C)alkyl]carbamoylethynyl groups such as N-(2-pyrrolidin-l-ylethyl)carbamoylethynyl.<br><br>
When, as defined hereinbefore, any CH2 or CH3 group within a R1 substituent optionally bears on each said CH2 or CH3 group one or more halogeno or (l-6C)alkyl<br>
   substituents, there are suitably 1 or 2 halogeno or (l-6C)alkyl substituents present on each said CH2 group and there are suitably 1, 2 or 3 such substituents present on each said CH3 group.<br>
When, as defined hereinbefore, any CH2 or CH3 group within a R1 substituent optionally bears on each said CH2 or CH3 group a substituent as defined hereinbefore, suitable R1 substituents so formed include, for example, hydroxy-substituted heterocyclyl-<br>
   (1 -6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-hydroxy-3-piperidinopropoxy and 2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropoxy, hydroxy-substituted amino-(2-6C)alkoxy groups such as 3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy, hydroxy-substituted (l-6C)alkylamino-(2-6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-hydroxy-3-methylaminopropoxy, hydroxy-substituted di-[(l-6C)alkyl]amino-(2-6C)alkoxy groups such as 3-dimethylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy, hydroxy-substituted heterocyclyl-<br>
i  (l-6C)alkylamino groups such as 2-hydroxy-3-piperidinopropylamino and 2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropylamino, hydroxy-substituted amino-(2-6C)alkylamino groups such as 3-amino-2-hydroxypropylamino, hydroxy-substituted (1 -6C)alkylamino-(2-6C)alkylamino groups such as 2-hydroxy-3-methylaminopropylamino, hydroxy-substituted di-[(l-6C)alkyl]amino-(2-6C)alkylamino groups such as 3-dimethylamino-<br>
   2-hydroxypropylamino, hydroxy-substituted (l-6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-hydroxyethoxy, (l-6C)alkoxy-substituted (l-6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-methoxyethoxy and 3-ethoxypropoxy, (l-6C)alkylsulphonyl-substituted (l-6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-methylsulphonylethoxy and heterocyclyl-substituted (l-6C)alkylamino-(l-6C)alkyl groups such as 2-morpholinoethylaminomethyl, 2-piperazin-l-ylethylaminomethyl and 3-morpholinopropylaminomethyl.<br>
Similar considerations apply to the attachments and substitutions within the -Z-Q1 group.<br>
When, as defined hereinbefore, G1 and G2 together form, for example, a group of formula -0-CH=CH-, it is the oxygen atom, not the carbon atom, which is attached to the ortho-position of the phenyl ring of formula la and the carbon atom is attached to the adjacent meta-position of the phenyl ring of formula la.<br><br>
A suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of a compound of the Formula I is, for example, an acid-addition salt of a compound of the Formula I, for example an acid-addition salt with an inorganic or organic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid; or, for example, a salt of a compound of the Formula I which is sufficiently acidic, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, or an ammonium salt, or a salt with an organic base such as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>

wherein Q1 has any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary with a quinazoline of the Formula IV<br><br>
wherein m, R1, R2, R3 and Q2 have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any    functional group is protected if necessary, whereafter any protecting group that is present is<br>
removed by conventional means.<br>
A suitable dehydrating agent is, for example, a carbodiimide reagent such as<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyIcarbodiimide or a mixture of<br>
an azo compound such as diethyl or di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate and a phosphine such as    triphenylphosphine. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert<br>
solvent or diluent, for example a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform<br>
or carbon tetrachloride and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C, preferably<br>

wherein Q1, Z, R2, R3 and Q2 have any of  the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary, with an appropriate alcohol wherein any functional group is protected if necessary, whereafter any protecting group that is present is removed by conventional means.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C, preferably at or near ambient temperature.<br>

The cleavage reaction may conveniently be carried out by any of the many procedures known for such a transformation. The cleavage reaction of a compound of the Formula I wherein R is a (l-6C)alkoxy group may be carried out, for example, by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with an alkali metal (l-6C)alkylsulphide such as sodium ethanethiolate or, for example, by treatment with an alkali metal diarylphosphide such as lithium diphenylphosphide. Alternatively the cleavage reaction may conveniently be carried out, for example, by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with a boron or aluminium trihalide such as boron tribromide. The cleavage reaction of a compound of the Formula I wherein R1 is a<br><br>
arylmethoxy group may be carried out, for example, by hydrogenation of the quinazoline derivative in the presence of a suitable metallic catalyst such as palladium or by reaction with an organic or inorganic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid. Such reactions are preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10,to 150°C, preferably at or near ambient temperature.<br>
(e)	For the production of those compounds of the Fonnula I wherein Q1, R1 or Q2 contains<br>
a primary or secondary amino group, the cleavage of the corresponding compound of Formula<br>
11	9<br>
I wherein Q , R or Q contains a protected primary or secondary amino group.<br>
Suitable protecting groups for an amino group are, for example, any of the protecting groups disclosed hereinbefore for an amino group. Suitable methods for the cleavage of such amino protecting groups are also disclosed hereinbefore. In particular, a suitable protecting group is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group which may be cleaved under conventional reaction conditions such as under acid-catalysed hydrolysis, for example in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
(f)	For the production of those compounds of the Formula I wherein Q1, R1 or Q2 contains<br>
a (l-6C)alkoxy or substituted (l-6C)alkoxy group or a (l-6C)alkylamino or substituted<br>
(l-6C)alkylamino group, the alkylation, conveniently in the presence of a suitable base as<br>
defined hereinbefore, of a quinazoline derivative of the formula I wherein Q1, R1 or Q2<br>
contains a hydroxy group or a primary or secondary amino group as appropriate.<br>
A suitable alkylating agent is, for example, any agent known in the art for the alkylation of hydroxy to alkoxy or substituted alkoxy, or for the alkylation of amino to alkylamino or substituted alkylamino, for example an alkyl or substituted alkyl halide, for example a (l-6C)alkyl chloride, bromide or iodide or a substituted (l-6C)alkyl chloride, bromide or iodide, conveniently in the presence of a suitable base as defined hereinbefore, in a suitable inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 140°C, conveniently at or near ambient temperature.<br>
Conveniently for the production of those compounds of the Fonnula I wherein Q1, R1 or Q2 contains a (l-6C)alkylamino or substituted (l-6C)alkylamino group, a reductive amination reaction may be employed. For example, for the production of those compounds of the Formula I wherein Q1, R1 or Q2 contains a N-methyl group, the corresponding compound containing a N-H group may be reacted with formaldehyde in the presence of a suitable reducing agent. A suitable reducing agent is, for example, a hydride reducting agent, for<br><br>
example an alkali metal aluminium hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride or, preferably, an alkali metal borohydride such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triethylborohydride, sodium trimethoxyborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride.

The following assays can be used to measure the effects of the compounds of the present invention as c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as inhibitors in vitro of the proliferation of c-Src transfected fibroblast cells, as inhibitors in vitro of the migration of A549 human lung tumour cells and as inhibitors in vivo of the growth in nude mice of xenografts of A549 tissue, (a)      In Vitro Enzyme Assay<br>
The ability of test compounds to inhibit the phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing polypeptide substrate by the enzyme c-Src kinase was assessed using a conventional Elisa assay.<br>
A substrate solution [100µL of a 20ug/ml solution of the polyamino acid Poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma Catalogue No. P0275) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2mg/ml of sodium azide] was added to each well of a number of Nunc 96-well immunoplates (Catalogue No. 439454) and the plates were sealed and stored at 4°C for 16 hours. The excess of substrate solution was discarded, and aliquots of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; 150µl of a 5% solution in PBS) were transferred into each substrate-coated<br><br>
approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity, (b)      In Vitro c-Src transfected NTH 3T3 (c-src 3T3) Fibroblast Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determined the ability of a test compound to inhibit the proliferation of i  National Institute of Health (NIH) mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells that had been stably-transfected with an activating mutant (Y530F) of human c-Src.<br>
Using a similar procedure to that described by Shalloway et al., Cell, 1987,49, 65-73, NTH 3T3 cells were transfected with an activating mutant (Y530F) of human c-Src. The resultant c-Src 3T3 cells were typically seeded at 1.5 x 104 cells per well into 96-well tissue-culture-treated clear assay plates (Costar) each containing an assay medium comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) plus 0.5% foetal calf serum (FCS), 2mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and O.lmg/ml streptomycin in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride solution. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C in a humidified (7.5% C02: 95% air) incubator.<br>
Test compounds were solubilised in DMSO to form a lOmM stock solution. Aliquots of the stock solution were diluted with the DMEM medium described above and added to appropriate wells. Serial dilutions were made to give a range of test concentrations. Control wells to which test compound was not added were included on each plate. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°Cin a humidified (7.5% C02: 95% air) incubator.<br>
BrdU labelling reagent (Boehringer Mannheim Catalogue No. 647 229) was diluted by a factor of 1:100 in DMEM medium containing 0.5% FCS and aliquots (20µl) were added to each well to give a final concentration of  100µM). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. The medium was decanted. A denaturating solution (FixDenat solution, Boehringer Mannheim Catalogue No. 647 229; 50µl) was added to each well and the plates were placed<br><br>
Mannheim Catalogue No. 647 229; 100µl) was added to each well. The plates were gently agitated on a plate shaker while the colour developed during a 10 to 20 minute period. The absorbance of the wells was measured at 690nm. The extent of inhibition of cellular proliferation at a range of concentrations of each test compound was determined and an anti¬proliferative IC50 value was derived.<br>
(c)	In Vitro Microdroplet Migration Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the migration of adherent mammalian cell lines, for example the human tumour cell line A549.<br>
RPMI medium(Sigma) containing 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine and 0.3% agarose (Difco Catalogue No. 0142-01) was warmed to 37°C in a waterbath. A stock 2% aqueous agar solution was autoclaved and stored at 42°C. An aliquot (1.5 ml) of the agar solution was added to RPMI medium (10 ml) immediately prior to its use. A549 cells (Accession No. ATCC CCL185) were suspended at a concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml in the medium and maintained at a temperature of 37 °C.<br>
A droplet (2fil) of the cell/agarose mixture was transferred by pipette into the centre of each well of a number of 96-well, flat bottomed non-tissue-culture-treated microtitre plate (Bibby Sterilin Catalogue No. 642000). The plates were placed briefly on ice to speed the gelling of the agarose-cantaining droplets. Aliquots (90|xl) of medium which had been cooled to 4°C were transferred into each well, taking care not to disturb the microdroplets. Test compounds were diluted from a 10mM stock solution in DMSO using RPMI medium as described above. Aliquots (10µl) of the diluted test compounds were transferred to the wells, again taking care not to disturb the microdroplets. The plates were incubated at 37°Cin a humidified (7.5% C02 : 95% air) incubator for about 48 hours.<br>
Migration was assessed visually and the distance of migration was measured back to the edge of the agar droplet. A migratory inhibitory IC50 was derived by plotting the mean migration measurement against test compound concentration.<br>
(d)	In Vivo A549 Xenograft Growth Assay<br>
This test measures the ability of compounds to inhibit the growth of the A549 human carcinoma grown as a tumour in athymic nude mice (Alderley Park nu/nu strain). A total of about 5 x 106 A549 cells in matrigel (Beckton Dickinson Catalogue No. 40234) were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of each test mouse and the resultant tumours were allowed to grow for about 14 days. Tumour size was measured twice weekly using callipers and a<br><br>
   theoretical volume was calculated. Animals were selected to provide control and treatment groups of approximately equal average tumour volume. Test compounds were prepared as a ball-milled suspension in 1% polysorbate vehicle and dosed orally once daily for a period of about 28 days. The effect on tumour growth was assessed.<br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the Formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the Formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b), (c) and (d):-<br>
Test (a):-        IC50 in the range, for example, 0.001 -10 µM;<br>
Test (b):-        IC50 in the range, for example, 0.01 - 20 µM;<br>
Test (c):-        activity in the range, for example, 0.01-25 µM;<br>
Test (d):-        activity in the range, for example, 1-200 mg/kg/day.<br>
No physiologically-unacceptable toxicity was observed in Test (d) at the effective dose for compounds tested of the present invention. Accordingly no untoward toxicological effects are expected when a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore is administered at the dosage ranges defined hereinafter.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dosing) or as a suppository for rectal dosing.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.<br><br>
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent (more suitably from 0.5 to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the Formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.<br>
In using a compound of the Formula I for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however preferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
As stated above, it is known that the predominant role of c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is to regulate cell motility which is necessarily required for a localised tumour to progress through the stages of dissemination into the blood stream, invasion of other tissues and initiation of metastatic tumour growth. We have found that the quinazoline derivatives of the present invention possess potent anti-tumour activity which it is believed is obtained by way of inhibition of one or more of the non-receptor tyrosine-specific protein kinases such as c-Src kinase that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the invasiveness and migratory ability of metastasising tumour cells.<br>
Accordingly the quinazoline derivatives of the present invention are of value as anti-tumour agents, in particular as selective inhibitors of the motility, dissemination and<br><br>
invasiveness of mammalian cancer cells leading to inhibition of metastatic tumour growth. Particularly, the quinazoline derivatives of the present invention are of value as anti-invasive agents in the containment and/or treatment of solid tumour disease. Particularly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours which are sensitive to inhibition of one or more of the multiple non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Src kinase that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the invasiveness and migratory ability of metastasising tumour cells. Further, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours which are mediated alone or in part by inhibition of the enzyme c-Src, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce a c-Src enzyme inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Specifically, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease.<br>

The 6-chloro-2,3-methylenedioxyaniline used as a starting material was prepared as follows :-<br>
Sulphuryl chloride (72.5 ml) was added dropwise during 1.7 hours to a stirred mixture of benzodioxole (100 g), aluminium trichloride (0.43 g) and diphenyl sulphide (0.55 ml). Once the reaction started with the evolution of sulphur dioxide, the reaction mixture was cooled in a water bath to a temperature of approximately 22°C. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was degassed under vacuum and filtered and the filtrate was distilled at atmospheric pressure using a Vigreux distillation column.

A mixture of diisopropylamine (4.92 ml) and THF (100 ml) was cooled to -78°C and n-butyllithium (2.5 M in hexane, 14 ml) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at -78°C for 15 minutes. 5-Chloro-l,3-benzodioxole (3.73 ml) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at -78°C for 30 minutes. Dry carbon dioxide gas was bubbled into the reaction mixture for 30 minutes. The resultant reaction mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and was stirred for a further hour. Water was added and the organic solvent was evaporated. The residue was acidified to pH2 by the addition of 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution.
