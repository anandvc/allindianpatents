				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a frame for supporting a printing screen and a printing screen unit thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to printing screens, often alternatively referred to as stencils or masks, for use in the screen printing of workpieces, typically electronic substrates, such as circuit boards and components, frames therefor, and printing screen units.<br>
In one known printing screen unit, the printing screen comprises a thin, stiff . metal sheet, typically of stainless steel or brass, which includes a plurality of printing apertures which define a pattern for the printing of a printing medium, typically solder paste. The printing screen is mounted to a rectangular frame by a flexible, perforate sheet, typically a woven mesh of polypropylene or stainless steel strands, which acts to tension the printing screen.<br>
Whilst the above-described printing screen unit has been well used, the unit does have a number of drawbacks, notably in being expensive to fabricate, and not allowing for the printing screen to be detached from the frame without permanently damaging the perforate sheet.<br>
In another, more recent printing screen unit, the printing screen is a demountable printing screen which comprises a thin, stiff metal sheet, typically of stainless steel, which includes a plurality of printing apertures which define a pattern for the printing of a printing medium, typically solder . paste, and a plurality of fixing apertures at opposite edges thereof. The printing screen is mounted to a frame by mechanical tensioning mechanisms which engage the fixing apertures in the printing screen and act to tension the printing screen, with the tensioning force typically being provided by hydraulic, pneumatic or spring means.<br>
WO-A-93/25061 discloses one such printing screen unit in which the printing screen includes a plurality of elongate slots, as the fixing apertures, along<br>
each of opposite edges thereof, and the tensioning mechanisms each Include a sol: of tooth which engage the slots at respective ones of the opposite edges of the printing screen to tension the printing screen, with the tensioning mechanisms being configured to draw respective ones of the opposite edges of the printing screen over respective supporting edges of the frame.<br>
GB-A--2364(J61. discloses another such printing screen unit in which the printing screen includes n plurality of first, fixing apertures along each of opposite edges thereof which arc engaged by respective tensioning mechanisms, and a plurality of second, Hexing apertures along each of the opposite edges thereof which extend inwardly of the respective fixing apertures and provide for regions of increased flexibility, with the tensioning mechanisms being configured to draw respective ones of the opposite edges of the printing screen over respective supporting edges of the frame.<br>
These printing screen units, in not: requiring the permanent attachment of a printing screen to a frame, advantageously allow for printing screens to be stored separately and mounted on frames as and when required, (.'hereby being cheaper and facilitating use.<br>
Those printing screen units do, however, still suffer from a number of<br>
significant drawbacks. In particular, the edges of the printing screens are<br>
required to be more flexible than the main body thereof, and, as such, are<br>
more prone to damage during handling and mounting. This is particularly<br>
the case as the printing screens are stored as unsupported sheets. Also, as<br>
the printing screens are very thin, typically having a thickness of from about<br>
0.1 to 0.25' mm, the edges thereof arc razor sharp, which can lead to<br>
personal injury to a user If not handled with utmost care. Further, the<br>
printing screens are restricted to being fabricated from materials which have<br>
the necessary strength to allow for direct tensioning by tensioning<br>
mechanisms.	Yet:    further,     the     printing    screens     require    specific<br>
manufacturing techniques, such as etching, electroforming and punching, and thereby limit: thr scope for mass fabrication.<br>

The printing screen unit 10 comprises a printing screen .12, in this embodiment of rectangular shape, a pair of interface members 16, 1G which are attached to one pair of opposite edges of the printing screen .1.2, and a pair of support members 10, 15.5 which are attached to the other pair of opposite edges of the printing screen 12.<br>
The printing screen 12 includes a pattern of apertures 20 which define the pattern of deposits to be printed. The pattern of apertures 20 can be formed, for example, by laser cutting or etching, as is well known in the art. In preferred embodiments the printing screen 12 comprises a sheet of a metal, such as stainless steel, or a plastic.<br>
The interface members 16, 16 each comprise an elongate member which extends along the length of the respective edge of the printing screen 12.<br>
The interface member's J 6, 16 each include an attachment section '?.?. which extends inwardly of the respective free edge of the printing screen 12, us Illustrated in Figure 1(c), and is In this embodiment bonded to the printing screen 12.   The bonding of the interface members 16, 16 to the printing<br>
screen 1.2 may be by any suitable adhesive or curing technique;, us would be known l;o a person skilled in tlie att.<br>
The interface members 10, 10 each further  include an engagement section 24 which, relative Lo the printing screen .12, is disposed outwardly of the attachment section 22 and provides for engagement to a tensioning mechanism.<br>
The engagement section 24 includes an inwardly-facing engagement surface 28, in this embodiment defined by a continuous channel, which extends along the length of the respective interface member J.G. The engagement surface 28 is outwardly inclined from the free edge thereof relative to the; printing screen 12, such as to define a hook arrangement: which provides for captive engagement with a tensioning meichanism. As will be appreciated, the engagement surface 28, in being defined by a continuous channel, allows for fabrication by a wide variety of manufacturing techniques, such as machining, routing and extrusion, which are much simpler and cheaper techniques than the fabrication techniques required in fabricating the; printing screen:; of the prior art printing screen units.<br>
The support members .1.8, 18 each comprise an elongate strip which extends along the length of the respective edge of the printing screen 12. The support: members 10, 18 provide both that no free, sharp edges of the printing screen 1.2 are exposed, thereby preventing the risk of injuiy during handling, and also further support, the printing screen 12, rendering the printing screen .1.2 loss prone to Hexing when being handled and stored. Furthermore, in providing the printing screen 12 with additional structural support, the printing screen .1.2 advantageously allows more readily for use of a plastic sheet. The ur,a of plastic sheets has many advantages, in being cheaper, easier to fabricate, and lighter. As described hereinabove, metal shoots, such as stainless steel sheets, necessarily have to be used for existing printing screens which are mounted directly to tensionable support<br>
frames, as the design of those existing printing screens is not such as l:o withstand the tension applied thereto by tensionable support: frames.<br>
In one alternative embodiment: the support members 18, 18 can bo omitted from the printing screen unit 10.<br>
In another alternative embodiment the printing screen unit 10 could include a second pair of interface members 16, 16 attached to respective ones of the other pair of opposite edges of the printing screen .12.<br>
Figures 2 (a) and (b) illustrate! a printing screen unit 10 in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The printing screen unit 10 of this embodiment is very similar to the printing screen unit 10 of the above-described first: embodiment, and thus, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of description, only the differences will be described in detail, with like pari:: being designated by like reference signs.<br>
The printing screen unit .1.0 of this embodiment differs from that of the first-described embodiment only in the manner of attachment of the printing screen 12 to the interface members 16, ,1,6.<br>
In this embodiment the interface members 16, 16 each include an elongate cover strip 1J0 which is bonded over the respective free edge of the printing screen :I2 such as to enclose the same. The bonding of the printing screen 12 to the main bodies and the cover strips 30 of the Interface members 16, .16 can be by any suitable adhesive or curing technique, as would be known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Figures 3(n) and (b) illustrate a printing screen unit 10 in accordance with a third embodiment of the present Invention.<br>
The printing screen unit: 1.0 of this embodiment is quite similar to the printing screen unit .1.0 of the above-described final ombodimont; unci thus, in order to avold unnecessary duplication of description, only the differences will be described in detail, with like parts being designated by like reference signs.<br>
