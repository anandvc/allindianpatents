				<td>Description<br>
Method of and Apparatus for Determining a Key Pair<br>
and for Generating RSA Keys<br>
The present invention relates to the RSA cryptography algo-<br>
rithm and in particular to the generation of RSA keys. The<br>
RSA cryptosystem, named after its inventors R. Rivest, A.<br>
Shamir and L Adleman, is one of the most widespread public<br>
key cryptosystems. It can be used both for obtaining se-<br>
crecy and for generating digital signatures. Its security<br>
is based on the fact that the so-called integer factoriza-<br>
tion problem cannot be solved presently in algorithmically<br>
efficient manner.<br>
Before dealing with the RSA cryptosystem in more detail,<br>
some basic terms of cryptography shall be outlined first.<br>
Generally, a distinction is made between symmetric encryp-<br>
tion systems, also referred to as secret key encryption<br>
systems, and public key encryption systems.<br>
A communication system with two parties making use of en-<br>
cryption by means of symmetric keys, can be described as<br>
follows. The first party communicates its encryption key to<br>
the second party via a secure channel. The first party then<br>
encrypts the secret message by means of the key and trans-<br>
raits the encrypted message to the second party via a public<br>
or non-secured channel. The second party then decrypts the<br>
encrypted message by use of the symmetric key that was com-<br>
municated to the second party via the secure channel. An<br>
essential problem with such encryption systems resides in<br>
providing an efficient way of exchanging the secret keys,<br>
i.e. of finding a secure channel.<br>
In contrast thereto, asymmetric encryption is carried out<br>
as follows. A party desiring to receive a secret message .<br>
communicates its public key to the other party, i.e. the<br>
party from which it desires to receive a secret message.<br>
The public key is communicated via a non-secured channel,<br>
i.e. via a "public" channel.<br>
The party desiring to send a secret message receives the<br>
public key of the other party, encrypts the message using<br>
the public key and transmits the encrypted message again<br>
via a non-secured channel, and thus a public channel, to<br>
the party from which the public key was sent. Only the<br>
party that generated the public key is capable of making<br>
available a private key for decrypting the encrypted mes-<br>
sage. Not even the party that encrypted its message using<br>
the public key is in the position of decrypting the mes-<br>
sage. An advantage of this concept consists in that no se-<br>
cure channel, and thus no secret exchange of keys, is re-<br>
quired between the two parties. The party that decrypted<br>
the message need not and must not know the private key of<br>
the message recipient.<br>
A physically, analogous scheme to the asymmetric encryption<br>
concept or the public key encryption concept can be out-<br>
lined as follows. Consider a metal box with a lid secured<br>
by a combination lock. The combination is known only to the<br>
party desiring to receive an encrypted message. If the lock<br>
is left open and made available to the public, anybody de-<br>
siring to communicate a secret message may place this mes-<br>
sage in the metal box and close the lid. However, only the<br>
party providing the box knows the combination of the combi-<br>
nation lock. Only this latter party is in the position to<br>
decrypt the message, i.e. to reopen the metal box. Even the<br>
party that placed the message in the box can no longer re-<br>
trieve the same.<br>
Essential for asymmetric or public key encryption concepts<br>
is the underlying mathematical problem the solution of<br>
which is nearly impossible utilizing the public key for de-<br>
cryption, but the solution of which is easily possible<br>
knowing the private key. One of the most common public key<br>
cryptosystems is the RSA cryptosystem. The RSA cryptosystem<br>
is described in the "Handbook of Applied Cryptography",<br>
Menezes, van Oorschot, Vanstone, CRC Press 1997, pages 285<br>
to 291.<br>
The first task consists in generating the keys for the RSA<br>
cryptosystem.. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 3. An<br>
entity that is to receive an encrypted message, in a first<br>
step 300 must generate first two large prime numbers p and<br>
q that preferably should have about equal quantities.<br>
Thereafter, in a step 310, the product of the two prime<br>
numbers is calculated, which is also referred to as modulus<br>
N. In addition thereto, Euler's j function is computed,<br>
which is equal to the product of (p-1) and (q-1). In a step<br>
320, a random integer e is selected then, with e being se-<br>
lected such that e is greater than 1 and smaller than j,<br>
with the further condition that the greatest common divisor<br>
gcd of e and j is 1, i.e. that e and j are relatively<br>
prime. Thereafter, in a step 330 a number d is computed<br>
that has to fulfil the following equation:<br>
d is also referred to as multiplicative inverse with re-<br>
spect to modulus j and usually is computed using the ex-<br>
tended Euclidean algorithm, which is also described in the<br>
"Handbook of Applied Cryptography", page 67. d thus is a<br>
unique integer that is greater than 1 and smaller than j<br>
and thus fulfils the equation given.<br>
In a step 340, the public key is then output, with the pub-<br>
lic key comprising the modulus N and the number e. In con-<br>
trast thereto, the private key d is not output, but is<br>
stored in a step 350 in order to be utilized for decryption<br>
when the key-generating entity has received a message that<br>
is encrypted using the public key output in step 340.<br>
i<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 2 in order to<br>
illustrate the RSA algorithm. The initial situation is that<br>
one communication partner encrypts a message M that has to<br>
be decrypted by the other communication partner. The en-<br>
crypting entity must first receive, in a step 200, the pub-<br>
lic key (N, e) in order to be able at all to send an en-<br>
crypted message to the other party. Following this, the en-<br>
crypting party, in a step 210, has to represent the message<br>
to be encrypted in the form of an integer M, with M having<br>
to be in the interval from 0 to N-l. In a step 220, which<br>
is the encryption step proper, the encrypting entity has to<br>
compute the following equation:<br>
C is the encrypted message. This message is then output in<br>
a step 230 and transmitted to the recipient of the en-<br>
crypted message via a public channel, designated 240 in<br>
Fig. 2. The recipient receives the encrypted message C in a<br>
step 250 and performs the following computation in a step<br>
260, which is the decryption step proper:<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that only the public key (N, e)<br>
is necessary for encryption, but not the private key d,<br>
whereas decryption requires the private key d.<br>
The question is now how an attacker can break the RSA<br>
cryptosystem. He knows the public key, i.e. N and e. In the<br>
same manner as shown in Fig. 3, he could now factorize the<br>
modulus N into a product of two prime numbers and then com-<br>
pute the secret key d in the same manner as it was done by<br>
the key-generating authentic party. To this end, the at-<br>
tacker would have to try all possible prime number pairs<br>
p', q' in order to sooner or later hit the private key d in<br>
consideration of e. With small prime numbers p and q, this<br>
problem is relatively easy to solve simply by trial. How-<br>
ever, if p and q, i.e. the modulus N that is the product of<br>
p and q, become increasingly greater, the various possi-<br>
bilities for the factorization of modulus N increase to as-<br>
tronomical extents. This is what the security of the RSA<br>
system is based on. It can be seen therefrom that secure<br>
cryptosystems must make use of very long numbers that may<br>
have a length of, for example, 512, 1024 or even up to 2048<br>
bits.<br>
With increasing length of the prime numbers p and q, how-<br>
ever, the computation of the multiplicative inverse, i.e.<br>
of the private key d in step 330 of Fig. 3, becomes time-<br>
critical as well. To this end, the extended Euclidean algo-<br>
rithm is utilized the required computation time of which<br>
may also assume considerable orders of magnitude with in-<br>
creasing length of the relevant numbers.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a more<br>
efficient concept for determining private keys.<br>
This object is met by a method of determining a key pair<br>
according to claim 1, a method of generating keys of an RSA<br>
encryption process according to claim 4, an apparatus for<br>
determining a key pair according to claim 5, and an appara-<br>
tus for generating keys for an RSA encryption process ac-<br>
cording to claim 6.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, in com-<br>
puting the multiplicative inverse using Euler's j func-<br>
tion, there is the problem that the two factors of Euler's<br>
j function, i.e. (p-1) and (q-1), are not relatively prime.<br>
This can be seen from that fact that prime numbers are odd<br>
numbers. If a value of "1" is subtracted from a prime num-<br>
ber, an even number results, such that the two factors (p-<br>
1) and (q-1) are no longer relatively prime to this effect,<br>
as they now have at least the common divisor "2". Euclid's<br>
algorithm thus must be computed as set forth in Fig. 3 with<br>
respect to the prior art, using the number (p-1)(q-1) of<br>
the full bit length, so that this step becomes critical in<br>
terms of time.<br>
According to the invention, the multiplicative inverse is<br>
no longer computed using Euler's j function, but rather us-<br>
ing Carmichael's l function.<br>
Utilization of Carmichael's l function has the effect that<br>
two factors on the right-hand side of the equation for com-<br>
puting the multiplicative inverse are relatively prime, so<br>
that the Chinese remainder theorem, also referred to as CRT<br>
(CRT = Chinese Remainder Theorem), may be used. The Chinese<br>
remainder theorem and the algorithm of Garner are described<br>
e.g. on page 68 and pages 612, 613 in the "Handbook of Ap-<br>
plied Cryptography". However, the Chinese remainder theorem<br>
can be utilized only if relatively prime factors are pre-<br>
sent.<br>
In computing the private key d, i.e. the multiplicative in-<br>
verse, the Chinese remainder theorem permits that, instead<br>
of one computation with full bit length, two computations<br>
of half bit length as well as a fast combination of the re-<br>
sults of the two computations with half bit length need to<br>
be carried out.<br>
This procedure has the effect that the private key can be<br>
computed up to four times faster than in case of utiliza-<br>
tion of Euler's j function as in the prior art.<br>
An advantage of the present invention consists in that,<br>
with the same computation time, it is now possible to make<br>
use of considerably longer prime numbers and that the secu-<br>
rity of the RSA cryptosystem can thus be increased consid-<br>
erably.<br>
In contrast thereto, maintaining the same security stan-<br>
dards as in the prior art, an acceleration with respect to<br>
computation time efficiency by a factor of four can be ob-<br>
tained right at the critical point, namely the computation<br>
of the multiplicative inverse. Crypto processors imple-<br>
mented according to the present invention thus may contrib-<br>
ute to a considerable increase in efficiency of e.g. TPM<br>
modules (TPM = Trusted Platform Module) or security ICs. As<br>
an alternative, the method according to the invention may<br>
also be utilized in smart cards in which, due to the lim-<br>
ited computation capacity available on the smart card, com-<br>
promises are often made with respect to the prime number<br>
length and thus with respect to security. With the aid of<br>
the present invention, the security standards can be in-<br>
creased considerably, maintaining the same computation<br>
time.<br>
Due to the fact that the two CRT terms can be computed<br>
separately from each other, the two CRT terms may also be<br>
computed in parallel in two separate arithmetic units and<br>
may finally be "joined together", so that further savings<br>
in computation time may be achieved by parallel implementa-<br>
tion.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
elucidated hereinafter with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of<br>
the method according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a summary of the RSA algorithm; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic flow chart for RSA key genera-<br>
tion.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a preferred embodiment of the method of deter-<br>
mining a key pair e, d, according to the invention, in<br>
which two prime numbers p, q are generated first, as is<br>
usual, which, multiplied by each other, result in the<br>
modulus N. In step 100, a first key e is selected then.<br>
Contrary to the prior art, however, the second key d is no<br>
longer computed using Euler's j function, but rather Carmi-<br>
chael's X function. Carmichael's X function is given as<br>
follows:<br>
X{N) = (p-1) (q-l)/gcd(p-l,q-l).<br>
The following relationship holds for Carmichael's X func-<br>
tion:<br>
Ml(N) = 1 mod N.<br>
The second key, i.e. the secret key d, then is computed on<br>
the basis of the known data e, p and q as follows:<br>
e x d = 1 mod kl{N) .<br>
For solving the above equation, i.e. for computing the<br>
multiplicative inverse d, the Chinese remainder theorem<br>
(CRT) may be used now since the factors<br>
(p-1)/gcd(p-l,q-l) and<br>
(q-1)<br>
now are relatively prime.<br>
By means of the Chinese remainder theorem, the problem of<br>
computing the multiplicative inverse d may now be split<br>
into the computation of two multiplicative inverses dp and<br>
dq and a combination step.<br>
To this end, dp first is computed so as to fulfil the fol-<br>
lowing defining equation:<br>
e x dp = 1 mod ((p-1)/gcd(p-l,q-l)].<br>
Analogously thereto, dq can be computed using the following<br>
defining equation:<br>
e x dq = 1 mod (q-1) .<br>
Alternatively, the relatively prime factors could also be<br>
obtained in the opposite manner, namely as<br><p-l and></p-l>
(q-1)/gcd(p-1,q-1).<br>
It is to be pointed out that, as known from the CRT, the<br>
two sub-keys dp and dq are half as long as the second key d<br>
proper.<br>
It is to be pointed out that the steps 110 and 120 of Fig.<br>
1 make use of two different sub-moduli. The first sub-<br>
modulus in step 110 reads:<br>
(p-l)/gcd(p-l,q-l).<br>
The second sub-modulus in step 120 merely reads:<br>
(q-1).<br>
It can be seen that the two sub-moduli are relatively prime<br>
due to the gcd function, so that the CRT will be success-<br>
ful. The two sub-keys dp and dq then are combined in a step<br>
130 using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) in order to<br>
thus generate the second or private key d.<br>
To this end, an auxiliary quantity xp is computed first,<br>
which is defined by the following equation:<br>
xp = (dp - dq) x [(q-1)-1 mod (p-1)/gcd (p-q, q-1) ]<br>
mod (p-1)/gcd(p-l,q-l).<br>
The inverse computation and the gcd computation in the<br>
above quotation are carried out using numbers of half<br>
length, which has the effect that these steps are less<br>
time-critical.<br>
The second key or private key d then results as follows:<br>
d = dp + xp x (q-1) mod l(N) .<br>
It is to be pointed out that the modular reduction with mod<br>
l(N) in the above equation need not be carried out any<br>
more, as d already is in the remainder class without reduc-<br>
tion.<br>
When the present invention is utilized for RSA key genera-<br>
tion, the latter improves in terms of its complexity in<br>
time, since the computation of multiplicative inverses, by<br>
way of the extended Euclidean algorithm, needs to be car-<br>
ried out with half bit length only as regards modulus N.<br>
The computation of the secret key d by means of the Chinese<br>
remainder theorem is faster by the factor of 4 as compared<br>
to the situation using no Chinese remainder theorem since,<br>
instead of using Euler's j function for computing the key<br>
pair e and d, Carmichael's l function is utilized as the<br>
same can be represented as a product of two relatively<br>
prime factors which then constitute the two sub-moduli for<br>
the Chinese remainder theorem.<br>
It is to be pointed out that the concept according to the<br>
invention cannot only be utilized,for RSA key generation,<br>
but in all situations in which a multiplicative inverse to<br>
a number is to be computed, with the modulus consisting of<br>
two or more factors that are not relatively prime with re-<br>
spect to each other. Carmichael's l function at all times<br>
will have the effect that the multiplicative inverse with<br>
respect to a modulus can be obtained using the Chinese re-<br>
mainder theorem as there are now relatively prime factors<br>
present that can be employed as sub-moduli.<br>

serving as a private key of the RSA encryption system;<br>
means for outputting said product (N) and the first number (e) of said pair of<br>
numbers as public key; and<br>
means for storing the second number (d) as private key.<br>
Method of and Apparatus for Determining a Key Pair and for<br>
Generating RSA Keys<br>
In a method of determining a pair of numbers comprising a<br>
first number and a second number, in which the first number<br>
may be a first key and the second number may be a second<br>
key of an encryption system and the second number is the<br>
multiplicative inverse with respect to a modulus of the<br>
first number, said modulus being equal to the product of a<br>
first prime number and a second prime number, the first<br>
number is selected first (100). Thereafter, a first sub-<br>
number (dp) for the second number (d) is computed as a<br>
multiplicative inverse of the first number (e) with respect<br>
to a first sub-modulus (110) that is equal to the first<br>
prime number minus 1 divided by the greatest common divisor<br>
of the first prime number minus 1 and the second prime num-<br>
ber minus 1. Then, a second sub-number (dq) for the second<br>
number (d) is computed as multiplicative inverse of the<br>
first number (e) with respect to a second sub-modulus (120)<br>
that is equal to the second prime number (q) minus 1, with<br>
said first sub-modulus and said second sub-modulus being<br>
relatively prime. Finally, the second number (d) is deter-<br>
mined using the first sub-number (dp) and the second sub-<br>
number  (dq)  by means of the Chinese remainder theorem<br>
(130). By utilization of the Chinese remainder theorem, the<br>
operation of forming the multiplicative inverse is trans-<br>
formed to two corresponding operations with shorter numbers<br>
and a fast combination step, so that an acceleration by the<br>
factor of 4 is obtained as compared to a method without<br>
Chinese remainder theorem.</td>
