				<td>BI-DIRECTIONAL SHIFT REGISTER<br>
This invention  relates  generally to drive circuits  for display  devices  and particularly  to  a  bi-directional  shift register for applying row select line signals to row select lines in a liquid crystal display (LCD).<br>
Display devices, such as liquid crystal displays,  are composed of a matrix or an array of pixels arranged horizontally in rows and vertically in columns.    The video information    to be displayed is applied as brightness (gray scale) signals to data lines which are individually associated with each column of pixels.    The rows of pixels are sequentially scanned by signals that are developed in row select lines.    The capacitance of the pixel associated with the activated row select line is charged to the various brightness levels in accordance with the level of the brightness signal applied to the individual columns via the corresponding  data  lines.<br>
Amorphous  silicon  has  been  the  preferable  technology for fabricating liquid crystal displays because this material can  be fabricated  at low  temperatures.     Low  fabrication  temperature  is important because it permits  the use of standard,  readily available and inexpensive substrate materials.     However,  the use of amorphous  silicon thin film transistors (a-Si TFTs) in integrated peripheral pixel drivers causes design difficulties because of low mobility,  threshold voltage drift and the availability of only N-type  metal  oxide  semiconductor  (N-MOS)  enhancement  transistors. The threshold voltage of the TFT increases permanently by an amount that varies in direct relation to the magnitude of the applied gate-source voltage.    The larger the gate-source voltage and the longer the time it is applied, the greater is the permanent increase in the threshold voltage.    Thus, the magnitude of the gate-source voltage  and its  duration exhibit stress  to which  the TFT is subjected.<br>
An example of a known scan or shift register that drives the row select lines is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,410,583, in the name of Weisbrod, et al., which may be coupled to an array of a liquid crystal display device.    The Weisbrod et al.,  shift register includes cascaded stages. An output section of a given stage of the register is arranged as  a push-pull amplifier<br>
-1A  -<br><br>
that may be formed by TFT's.    When a given row is de-selected, a pull-down TFT of the push-pull  amplifier is  turned  on  for applying a suitable impedance at a terminal of a row line conductor of the de-selected row.  When the  given row is  selected,  a pull-up transistor is  turned on for producing  an output pulse  of the  given stage.<br>
A  further  transistor  that  is  responsive  to  an  output pulse of a stage downstream of the given stage is coupled to a control  terminal  of the  pull-down  transistor for  developing  a control voltage.  The control voltage may be slightly larger than the threshold   voltage  of  the  pull-down  transistor.   Thereby, advantageously,   stress   in   the  pull-down   transistor  is   reduced. Stress tends to produce a threshold voltage drift in the TFT's. The further  transistor  operates  at a  low  duty  cycle.  Therefore, advantageously,  it is  also  subject to  a reduced  stress.<br>
The  array  of pixels  may be equipped with terminals  or pins for connecting the row select lines of the array to the shift register. For a given array, the pins may be organized in a predetermined  successive  order.   For  example,   the  pin   associated with the row select line at the top of the pixel array may be placed at one end of a group of conductors; whereas, the pin associated with the row select line at the bottom of the pixel array may be placed at the other end. Similarly, the integrated circuit (IC)  that contains  the  shift register may be  equipped with terminals or pins for connecting the row select line drivers  to the pins of the array.    The pins of the shift register IC may be also organized in a similar successive order. The pins of the shift register IC and those of the row select lines are coupled to each other, respectively.    The required direction of shifting in  the  shift register depends on the order of the pins of the array relative to the order of the pins of the shift register IC.<br>
To obtain versatility, it may be desirable to use the same IC when shifting in a first direction is desired and when shifting in an opposite direction is desired.    For example, in some projection  display  applications  that includes  three  LCD  arrays  for displaying  the  three primary colors,  one array of pixels  may be scanned from the bottom to the top of the display. Whereas,  the other  two  arrays  may  be  scanned  in  the  conventional  manner,<br>
-2-<br><br>
from  the  top  to the bottom of the display.  Thus,  it  may  be desirable to make the shift register bi-directional. It may be further  desirable to obtain the bi-directional  feature without adding excessive circuitry.. It may also be desirable to operate the  TFT's of  the bi-directional shift  register with  reduced stress.<br>
A bi-directional shift register, embodying an aspect of the invention, includes a source of a plurality of phase shifted clock signals having a first phase relationship therebetween, when a first direction of shifting is selected, and having a second phase relationship therebetween, when an opposite direction of shifting is selected. A plurality of cascaded stages are coupled to the source of the clock signals. A given stage of the cascaded stages includes a first output transistor for generating an output pulse at an output of the given stage, when, during a corresponding clock signal associaed with the given stage, the transistor is enabled. When the first output transistor is disabled, during the associated clock signal, the first output transistor prevents the generation of the output pulse of the given stage. A first input section is responsive to a corresponding output pulse generated in each one of second and third stages for enabling the first output transistor when each of the second stage and third stage output pulses occurs. When the first phase relationship is selected, the given stage output<br>
-3-<br><br>
pulse occurs fallowing the second stage output pulse. When the second  phase  relationship is selected, the given  stage  output pulse  occurs  following the third stage output pulse.  A second input   section  responsive  to  a  corresponding  output   pulse generated in a corresponding stage for disabling the first output transistor after the given stage ouput pulse has occurred.

FIGURE  1  illustrates a block diagram of a  shift  register including a plurality of cascaded stages;<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates a schematic diagram of a shift register stage, embodying an aspect of the invention, that can be used in the shift register of FIGURE 1;<br>
FIGURES  3a-3g  are diagrams of the relative timing  of  the output  signals  and the respective clock  signals  occurring  at respective nodes of the FIGURE 1 shift register utilizing stages illustrated  in  FIGURE 2 when the shift  register  performs  the shifting operation in one direction; and<br>
-3A-<br><br>
FIGURES 4a-4h are diagrams of the relative timing of the  output  signals  and the respective  clock  signals  occurring  at respective nodes of the FIGURE  1  shift register utilizing stages illustrated in FIGURE  2  when the  shift register performs  the shifting  operation in an opposite direction to  that shown in FIGURES 3a-3g.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates an exemplary stage n, of a shift register 100 of FIGURE 1.    Shift register 100 of FIGURE 1 drives row select lines  118 of a liquid crystal display matrix,  not shown. A clock generator  101  produces  a three-phase clock signal,  (clock signals Cl, C2 and C3) that control shift register 100.<br>
In shift register  100, stages n-1, n, n+1  and n+2 are coupled to one another in a cascade configuration.    An output pulse signal of a given stage is coupled to an input of the immediately following stage in the chain.    For example,    an output pulse  signal  OUTn-1  of stage n-1 in the chain of register 100 is coupled to an input terminal 12 of stage n of FIGURE 2 for shifting in a first direction.    The first direction is referred to herein as the top-to-bottom  direction  because  it  can  provide  for  top-to-bottom scanning in a vertical direction.  Similarly,  an output pulse  signal OUTn+1  of stage n+1 in the chain of register 100 is coupled to an input terminal  12a of stage n for shifting in the opposite direction, referred  to   herein  as   the  bottom-to-top  direction.     Illustratively, only four stages, n-1, n, n+1 and n+2 are shown.    However, the total number of stages n in the chain of register  100 is substantially   larger.<br>
FIGURES  3a-3g are waveform diagrams of the relative timing of the output signals  and the respective clock signals occurring at respective nodes of the FIGURE  1  shift register utilizing stages illustrated in FIGURE 2 when shifting in a first direction in the  shift register is  selected,  referred to  as  the  top-to-bottom selection mode.    FIGURES 4a-4h are waveform diagrams of the relative timing of the output signals  and the respective clock signals occurring at respective nodes of the FIGURE  1  shift register utilizing stages illustrated in FIGURE 2 when shifting in the opposite  direction in the  shift register is  selected,  referred to herein  as  the bottom-to-top  selection mode.     Similar  symbols  and<br>
-4-<br><br>
numerals in FIGURES   1, 2,  3a-3g and 4a-4h indicate similar items or   functions.<br>
Shift register 100 of FIGURE 1  may be referred to as a "walking one"  shift register.    This means a TRUE state propagates through  register  100 during  a video frame  time. The clock signals Cl, C2 and C3 determine whether the TRUE state propogates through in an ascending order or a descending order of stages n of register  100.  When  the TRUE state  propogates  through  the ascending order of stages n, referred to as shifting in the first direction, as shown in FIGURES 3d-3g, the rows of the display (not shown)  may be  successively  selected in  the direction  from  the  top to  the  bottom of the  display,  referred  to  herein  as  top-to-bottom row  selection mode.  Whereas,  when the TRUE  state propogates through  the descending  order of stages  n, referred to as  shifting  in an opposite direction, as shown in FIGURES 4d-4h, the rows of the display,  not shown,  may be  successively  selected in the direction from the bottom to the top of the display, referred to herein as bottom-to-top   row   selection.<br>
Assume  that  the  relative  phases  between  clock  signals Cl, C2 and C3 are the same in both the top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top row selection modes, as shown in FIGURES 3a-3c and 4a-4c, respectively.     In  the  top-to-bottom row  selection mode,  clock signal Cl  is developed on a conductor  101a of register 100 of FIGURE 1; clock signal C2 is developed on a conductor 101b of register  100; and clock signal C3 is developed on a conductor  101c of register  100. On the other hand, in the bottom-to-top row selection mode, clock signals Cl  and C3 are inter-changed with each other and are developed on  conductors   101c  and   101a, respectively.<br>
In  the  conventional  top-to-bottom  row   selection  mode, for example, signal OUTn-1 of FIGURE 1 is developed at input terminal 12 of stage n of FIGURE 2.   Signal OUTn-1 at the HIGH level is coupled via a transistor 18 of FIGURE 2 operating as a switch to a terminal  188 for developing a control signal P1.    The pulse of signal OUTn-1   of FIGURE 3d occurs coincidentally with clock signal C3. Signal OUTn-1 of stage n-1 that is coupled to input terminal  12 of stage n is also coupled to the gate electrode of a transistor 21.    A drain of transistor 21  is coupled via a terminal<br>
-5-<br><br>
211  to a gate of a transistor  19 and to the gate electrode of a pulldown transistor  17.    As a result,  transistor 21   is placed into conduction  which  renders  both   transistors   19  and   17   non-conductive.<br>
The HIGH or TRUE level of signal PI is temporarily stored in  an  inter-electrode  capacitance,  CP,  and in a bootstrap capacitor 30.    Signal P1  that is developed at the gate of an output transistor   16  conditions  output transistor   16  for conduction.     Clock signal Cl  of FIGURE 3b is coupled via transistor 16 to an output terminal  13 when terminal  188 is high.    Clock signal Cl  that is coupled  via  an inter-electrode  parasitic  capacitance  CP  to bootstrapping  capacitor  30,  developed  at  the  gate  of transistor   16, tends  to  bootstrap  the  potential  at  terminal   188  for  providing extra drive  to  transistor  16.     Consequently,  an output pulse  signal OUTn is developed at the output terminal  13 of register n.    During output    pulse signal OUTn,  pull-down transistor  17  is  rendered non-conductive  by  the  operation  of transistor 21   and has  no  effect then on signal OUTn.<br>
Signal   OUTn of stage n is applied to an input terminal of subsequent stage n+1 of FIGURE 1.    Stage  n+1  operates similarly to stage n except for utilizing clock signal C2, instead of clock signal Cl  in stage n, for turning on the corresponding transistor. When clock signal Cl  attains the inactive LOW level,  transistor  16 remains turned on until signal P1 goes low.    Signal OUTn of stage n goes  low by virtue of discharge  through transistor  16  when clock signal Cl is low.<br>
A  transistor  25  has  its  drain-source  conduction  path coupled  between  terminal   188  and  a reference  potential  VSS1 sufficient to  turn off or disable pull-up  transistor   16  when transistor 25 is conductive.    The gate of transistor 25 of stage n is coupled to an output terminal of subsequent stage n+2 in the chain of FIGURE 1 and is controlled by an output signal OUTn+2.   Signal OUTn+2  is generated downstream of the pulse propagation path in register   100.<br>
The pulse of signal OUTn+2  occurs concurrently with clock signal C3 of FIGURE 3a.   The pulse of signal OUTn+2 causes transistor 25 of FIGURE 2 to discharge the capacitance associated with  terminal   188.     Transistor 25  clamps  the  signal at terminal<br>
-6-<br><br>
18a to a level that disables transistor 16 and prevents transistor 16 from generating any additional pulse of signal OUTn when the immediately following pulse of clock signal Cl  occurs.<br>
The pulse of signal OUTn+2 is also coupled to a gate of a transistor 20 that is a TFT for turning on transistor 20. Transistor 20 applies a voltage VDD to terminal 211  for turning on transistors   17  and  19.    Thus,  transistor 20 is turned on only during the selection of one row out of, for example, 560 rows. Therefore,  transistor 20 operates  in a low duty cycle. Consequently,  transistor 20  is  not significantly  stressed.     The result is  that  threshold  voltage  drift of transistor 20  is  reduced and  its  operational  lifetime  is  increased.<br>
Following the pulse of signal OUTn+2, transistor 20 is turned off.    However, a capacitor 32 that is coupled to the gate of transistors   17  and  19  stores  a charge by the operation of transistor 20.    The  stored charge in capacitor 32  maintains transistors   17  and   19  conductive until  the  next scanning  cycle, when the signal at terminal   12 causes transistor 21  to turn on and, thereby, cause transistors  17 and  19 to turn off.    Capacitor 32 also provides  noise filtering for the signal  at terminal  12.<br>
As long as transistor 17 is conductive, it operates as a pull-down  transistor  for  applying  a  suitable  impedance  at terminal  13.    Thus,  transistor  17  sinks  a current il7. Advantageously,   the  drain-source  impedance  of  transistor   17   is sufficiently low to discharge the high level on the row select line and in addition it is sufficiently low to sink any parasitic currents coupled to the row select line from the column lines of the LCD matrix.     If parasitic  currents  are not dissipated by  transistor  17, they  may produce  potentials  that  grow  to  a magnitude  sufficiently large to cause a false selection in the subsequent register stage. Thus,  a false  selection  is  prevented  provided  that  the  threshold voltage  of transistor  17  does  not  significantly  increase  over the operation  life.     Advantageously,  when  transistor  19  is  conductive, it prevents clock signals Cl  and C3 from turning on transistor  16.<br>
A pulse at each output terminal of register  100 of FIGURE 1, for example, the pulse of signal OUTn+2, occurs only once  during  a  vertical  interval  of approximately   16.6  millisecond. Therefore,  advantageously,   none  of  the  switched  transistors   18,<br>
-7-<br><br>
16, 20 and 25 of stage n of FIGURE 2 is biased for conduction more than  one clock period,  during  each  vertical  interval.<br>
However,  transistors   17  and   19  are  biased  for continuous conduction,  during most of the vertical interval.     To reduce stress in transistors   17 and  19,  signal P2 at the gate of transistor  17  is  established at a voltage level that is  not significantly  greater  than  the  threshold  voltage  of transistor   17.<br>
In  accordance  with  an inventive  feature,  clock  signals C1   and C3  are inter-changed  with each  other,  in  the  bottom-to-top row  selection  mode,  relative  to  the  situation  in  the  top-to-bottom row selection mode.    Thus, clock signal Cl is coupled, in the bottom-to-top mode,  to the same stages to which clock signal C3 is coupled,  in  the  top-to-bottom  selection  mode,  and  vice  versa. Clock signal C2 is coupled to the same stages in both selection modes.    Thus, clock signal Cl, shown without parenthesis in FIGURES  1  and 2, is coupled, in the top-to-bottom selection mode, for example,  to stage n.    Whereas,  in the bottom-to-top  selection mode, clock signal Cl, shown in parenthesis in FIGURES  1 and 2, is coupled, for example, to stages n-1  and n+2.    In contrast, clock signal C3, shown without parenthesis in FIGURES  1 and 2, is coupled,  in  the  top-to-bottom  selection mode,  to  stages  n-1   and n+2.    Whereas, in the bottom-to-top selection mode, clock signal C3, shown in parenthesis in FIGURES  1 and 2, is coupled to stage n. In the bottom-to-top selection mode, instead    of clock signal Cl, clock signal C3, shown in parenthesis, is coupled to the drain electrode of transistor  16 of FIGURE 2.  Advantageously, by merely interchanging clock signals Cl  and C3, register 100 of FIGURE 1 is selectably adapted for. either shifting in the first direction  or in the   opposition  direction.<br>
In  the  bottom-to-top row  selection  mode,  signal OUTn+1  of FIGURE 1 is developed at input terminal 12a of stage n of FIGURE 2.   Signal OUTn+l at the HIGH   level is coupled via a transistor 18a of FIGURE 2, operating as a switch, to terminal  188 for developing control signal P1. Transistor  18a is analogous  to transistor  18  that was referred to before.  Signal OUTn+1   of FIGURE 4e occurs coincidentally with clock signal C2.<br>
Signal OUTn+1 of stage n+1 that is coupled to input terminal 12a of stage n of FIGURE 2 is also coupled to the gate<br>
-8-<br><br>
electrode  of a transistor 21a.  Transistor 21a is  analogous  to transistor 21,   that was  referred  to  before.  A  drain of transistor 21a is coupled via terminal 211  to the gate of transistor  19 and to the gate electrode of pull-down transistor  17.    As  a result,  both transistors   19   and   17   are   rendered   non-conductive.<br>
The HIGH or TRUE level of signal P1 is temporarily stored  in  the  aforementioned  inter-electrode  capacitance  CP  and   in capacitor 30.    Signal P1  that is developed at the gate of output transistor  16 conditions  output transistor  16  for conduction.     Clock signal C3 of FIGURE 4a is coupled via transistor 16 to output terminal  13 when terminal  188 is high.    Clock signal C3 that is coupled  via interelectrode  parasitic  capacitance  CP  tends  to bootstrap  the  potential  at  terminal   188  for  providing  extra  drive to transistor  16.    Consequently, output pulse signal OUTn is developed at the output terminal  13  of register n.    During this interval,   pull-down   transistor   17   is   rendered   non-conductive   by the operation of transistor 21a and has  no effect then on signal OUTn.<br>
Signal   OUTn of stage n is applied to an input terminal<br>
of stage n-1 of FIGURE 1.    Stage n-1 operates similarly to stage n except for utilizing clock signal Cl, instead of clock signal C3, in stage n, for turning on the corresponding transistor.    When clock signal C3 attains the inactive LOW level, transistor 16 of stage n remains turned on until signal P1  goes low.    Signal OUTn of stage n goes low by virtue of discharge through transistor  16 when clock signal C3 is low.<br>
A transistor 25a that is analogous to transistor 25, referred  to  before,  has  its  drain-source  conduction  path  coupled between  terminal   188  and  a reference  potential  VSS1   sufficient  to turn  off or disable  pull-up  transistor   16  when  transistor 25a is conductive.    The gate of transistor 25a of stage n is coupled to an output terminal of stage n-2 of FIGURE 1  and is controlled by an output  signal  OUTn-2-    Signal OUTn-2 is generated downstream of the  pulse  propagation path  in  register  100.<br>
The pulse of signal OUTn-2 of FIGURE 4h occurs concurrently with clock signal C2 of FIGURE 4c, during interval t1-t2.   The pulse of signal OUTn-2 causes transistor 25a of FIGURE 2 to  discharge   the  aforementioned  inter-electrode  capacitance  CP  at<br>
-9-<br><br>
terminal   188.     Transistor 25a clamps the signal at terminal   188  to a  level  that  disables   transistor   16  for  preventing  transistor   16 from  generating an additional pulse of signal OUTn, when the immediately following pulse of clock signal C3 occurs.<br>
The pulse of signal OUTn-2 is also coupled to a gate of a transistor 20a that is a TFT for turning on transistor 20a. Transistor  20a  is  analogous  to  transistor 20,  referred  to  before. Transistor 20a applies voltage  VDD  to terminal 211  for turning on transistors   17  and  19.    Thus,  transistor 20a is turned on only during the selection of one row out of, for example, 560 rows. Therefore,  transistor 20a operates in  a  low  duty cycle. Consequently,  transistor  20a is  not significantly  stressed.     The result is  that  threshold  voltage drift of transistor 20a is  reduced and  its  operational  lifetime  is  increased.<br>
Following the pulse of signal OUTn-2, transistor 20a is turned off.    However, a capacitor 32a that is coupled to the gate of transistors   17  and  19  stores a charge by the operation of transistor 20a.  Capacitor 32a is  analogous  to capacitor 32,  referred to  before.  The  stored  charge in capacitor  32a maintains  transistors 17  and  19 conductive until the next scanning cycle,  when the signal  at terminal   12a causes  transistor 21a to turn on and, thereby, transistors  17 and  19 to turn off.    Capacitor 32a also provides  noise  filtering for the signal at terminal  12a.<br>
In  accordance  with  an inventive  feature,  the  bidirectional  feature  of register   100  is  obtained  by  merely interchanging clock signals Cl  and C3, as explained before.    It is obtained  without  the  need  for  changing   interconnections   between the stages of register  100 or applying other control  signals  to each stage  n.  Therefore,  circuit  simplification is  obtained.<br>
Each pulse of signal OUTn-l of FIGURE 3d and 3g and signal  OUTn+1 of FIGURE 3f and 4e conditions transistor 16 of FIGURE 2 for conduction, without distinction whether shifting in the first direction or in the opposite direction is selected. Advantageously,   this   feature   provides   design   simplification. However,  in the top-to-bottom selection mode,  signal OUTn+2 of FIGURE 3g changes the state of conductivity of transistor 16 of FIGURE 2 from the conduction state to the non-conduction or disabled state prior to the immediately  following pulse of clock<br>
-10-<br><br>
signal Cl.    The immediately following pulse of clock signal Cl occurs, during interval tl-t2 of FIGURE 3b.    Therefore, advantageously,  signal  OUTn+l  of FIGURE 3f is prevented from causing the generation of signal OUTn of FIGURE 2.   Similarly, in the bottom-to-top selection mode, signal OUTn-2 of FIGURE 4h changes the state of conductivity of transistor  16 of FIGURE 2 from the  conduction  state  to  the  non-conduction  state,  prior to  the immediately following pulse of clock signal C3,  during interval  t3-t4 of FIGURE 4a.    Therefore, advantageously, signal OUTn-l of FIGURE 4g is prevented from causing the generation of signal OUTn of FIGURE 2.<br>
