The present invention relates to novel processes and synthetic intermediates for the preparation of α-difluoromethyl ornithine.<br>
[0002] Eflornithine or α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) has recently been approved in the United States in a topical cream for removing unwanted facial hair. Efficient, scaleable syntheses of DFMO are therefor useful to provide manufacturing processes.<br>
[0003]	A preparation of DFMO have been described previously in US<br>
Patent 'No. 4,309,442 from ornithine. The relatively high cost of the starting material, ornithine, and the use of less desirable reagents including flammable reagents, however, makes the route less attractive for commercial manufacture.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0010]	In accordance with the present invention, novel processes and<br>
intermediates for the preparation of difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO or the compound of formula 1) are provided. The processes of the invention have been developed from readily available and inexpensive starting materials. Furthermore, the processes provide high yields of DFMO, simplify isolation and purification steps, and minimize the use of halogenated solvents.<br>
[0011]	In one embodiment of the invention an alkyl glycine ester of the<br>
formula 2 serves as a convenient starting material for a short synthesis of an alkyl 2-difluoromethyl-4-cyanobutanoate intermediate (compound of the formula 5) wherein R is C1 to C4 linear or branched alkyl and R2 is hydrogen, C1 to C4 linear or branched alkyl, or aryl. Compound of the formula 5 can then be converted by a number of processes to DFMO.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
 [0012]	The compound of formula 3 can be obtained from the glycine ester<br>
of the formula H2NCH2CO2R1, (formula 2) wherein R1 is C1 to C4 alkyl. Preferably the alkyl group is methyl, ethyl, or t-butyl. Glycine ethyl ester, for example, is readily available from a number of commercial vendors as its hydrochloride salt. The compound of the formula 3 can be formed by treatment of the glycine ester of the formula 1 with an aryl aldehyde or ketone of the formula PhC(0)R2, wherein R2 is hydrogen, C1 to C4 alkyl or aryl (Scheme 1). A dehydrating agent such as magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate can optionally be used to remove the water generated in the reaction. If the glycine ester of the formula 2 is provided as an acid addition salt, a tertiary amine base, e.g., triethylamine (TEA), tributylamine (TBA) or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, can be included in the reaction mixture to generate the neutral form of the ester.<br>
[0013]	While conventional methods for the preparation of Schiff s base<br>
derivatives of glycine alkyl ester utilize halogenated reaction solvents such as dichloromethane, applicants have found that the reaction for the preparation of afdimine type intermediates (R2=H), can be advantageously carried out in acetonitrile at temperatures of about 10 to 35 °C, preferably at about 20 to 25 °C. The use of acetonitrile as a reaction solvent simplifies reaction work-up procedures and processing. The magnesium sulfate and tertiary amine base-acid addition salt (if used) can be simply removed by, for example, filtration, and the filtrate used directly in the next synthetic step, where acetonitrile also serves as the reaction solvent.<br>
[0014]	These reaction conditions can provide high yields and conversions,<br>
preferably &gt;98% for both yield and conversion, of compound of the formula 3.<br>
[0015]	In embodiments of the process where the amino group is protected<br>
as a ketone imine (i.e., R2=C1 to C4 alkyl or aryl) the condensation reaction can also be accomplished using an aprotic solvent, e.g., xylene or toluene (preferably toluene), and catalytic amount of a Lewis acid, e.g., boron trifluoride etherate, triphenyl boron, zinc chloride, aluminum chloride, and the like. The condensation reaction can include the use of a Dean Stark trap and/or the use of other such dehydrating techniques known to those of ordinary skill to hasten the reaction rate by removing the formed water effectively.<br>
[0016] The alkyl 4-cyanobutanoate of the formula 4 is, in one embodiment, obtained from the compound of the formula 3 by a Michael reaction. For example, compound of the formula 3 is treated with acrylonitrile, a base such as potassium carbonate and a phase transfer catalyst (PTC), such as triethylbenzylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, or trimethyibenzylammonium chloride at temperatures of from about 10 to about 45 °C, preferably from about 20 to 35 °C. Methods for the phase transfer catalyzed Michael addition of oc-amino acids wherein the oc-amino groups are protected as benzaldimines can be found in Yaozhong et al., Tetrahedron 1988, 44, 5343-5353.<br>
[0017] The compound of formula 4 is then alkylated using a strong base and a halodifiuoromethane alkylating reagent to form the compound of formula 5. Suitable strong bases include those that are effective in deprotonating the compound of formula 4 at the position a to the carboxylate. Examples of strong bases include alkali metal alkoxides of the formula MOR3 wherein M is Na, Li or K and R3 is C1 to C4 linear or branched alkyl; alkali metal hydrides, or alkali metal amide (e.g., sodium amide, sodium bistrimethylsilylamides). Preferably the alkoxide base is either a sodium or potassium alkoxide, more preferably a sodium alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide or sodium t-butoxide. Preferably, a slight molar excess of base is used in the reaction such as from about 1.6 to 2.0 equivalents.<br>
[0018] The alkylation reaction is carried out, for example, by deprotonation at a temperature of from about -35 to about 25 °C. Once the a-anion has been generated, the alkylating reagent is introduced and the temperature of the reaction can be, for example, from about -5 to about 20 °C (for R2=aryl). Useful halodifiuoromethane alkylating reagents include difluoroiodomethane, chlorodifluoromethane, or bromodifluoromethane. Preferably the halodifiuoromethyl alkylating reagent is chlorodifluoromethane. Typically an excess of the halodifiuoromethyl alkylating reagent is used in the reaction such as from about 1.05 to about 2.0 molar equivalents. In instances where the alkylation reaction is run in a pressure vessel, smaller amounts of the halodifiuoromethyl alkylating agent are used.<br>
[0019]	The alkylation reaction is carried out in suitable aprotic solvents<br>
such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, or an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyItetrahydrofuran, methyl t-butyl ether, diethyl<br>
ether, dioxane, or mixtures thereof. Preferably the solvent used in this alkylation reaction is an ether, preferably tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydrofuran/acetonitrile.<br>
{0020] In Process A (Scheme 2, Route I) for the synthesis of DFMO, the synthetic steps include: hydrolysis of the Schiff s base protecting group, reduction of the nitrile moiety and hydrolysis of the alkyl ester moiety. The Schiff s base protecting group of the compound of the formula 5 is hydrolyzed by treatment with an aqueous acid using conditions well known in the art, to provide the compound of formula 6. Suitable acids include mineral acids, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. The reaction is conveniently carried out in a mixture of the aqueous acid and an organic solvent. For example, a mixture .of methyl t-butyl ether and 4 N HC1 is stirred at ambient temperature to effect hydrolysis of the Schiff s base. After the reaction mixture is made basic with hydroxide solution, the compound of formula 6 isolated in neutral form and used directly without further purification in the next synthetic step. Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
 [0021]	The compound of the formula 6 is then converted to the diamino<br>
compound of formula 7 by reduction of the nitrile moiety. Any reduction procedure effective to selectively reduce the nitrile moiety to the amine with minimal competing ester reduction can be used. For example, heterogeneous transition metal catalysts are effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of the nitrile moiety. Typically an acid such as hydrochloric acid is added to the reaction mixture. The transition metal catalysts include, for example, palladium on carbon, platinum on carbon, and platinum oxide. Preferably the catalyst used in the reduction is 5-10% platinum on carbon.<br>
[0022]	The amount of hydrochloric acid typically used in the reaction is 1<br>
to 5 equivalents, more preferably 3 to 4 equivalents.    The reaction solvent for the<br>
hydrogenation can be an alcohol, preferably ethanol or an ether, preferably t-butyl methyl ether. The reaction is carried out in a suitable corrosive resistant reaction vessel such as a Hastelloy bomb vessel with hydrogen at a pressure of, for example, from about 80 to about 120 psi. The hydrogenation is typically run at temperatures from about 25 to about 40 °C, preferably about 25 to 30 °C.<br>
[0023]	DFMO can be obtained by hydrolysis of the alkyl ester moiety of<br>
the diamino compound of the formula 7. In one embodiment, the alkyl ester moiety can be hydrolyzed using aqueous basic conditions well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, the alkyl ester moiety can be hydrolyzed using acidic conditions. Suitable acids for the hydrolysis reaction include mineral acids or toluene sulfonic acid. Preferably the hydrolysis is effected using an excess of mineral acid, for example 12 N HC1 at reflux. In the instance'where R1 is a t-butyl ester, the t-butyl ester can also be hydrolyzed by milder acidic hydrolysis methods well known in the art, such as treatment with formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
[0024]	DFMO can be conveniently isolated as its monohydrochloride<br>
monohydrate salt. For example, a solution of from about 9 to about 13% by weight DFMO in about a 1 to 3-3.5 mixture of aqueous hydrochloric acid 12 N and alcohol, preferably ethanol, is provided with a pH of less than 0.5. The resulting solution can be treated with sufficient triethylamine to effect a pH of about 4 to form a slurry containing precipitated DFMO dihydrochloride. The precipitated DFMO hydrochloride monohydrate is recovered by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art including filtration and centrifugation. The crude DFMO recovered can be further purified by recrystallization from suitable recrystallizing solvents such as ethanol/water. Preferably the purity of the DFMO is at least 98%, more preferably at least 99% pure.<br>
[0025]	In alternative embodiments of Process A, metal hydride reagents<br>
can be used to effect the selective reduction of the nitrile moiety. These hydride reagents include NaBH3(02CCF3) and other such modified borohydride and aluminum hydride reagents that selectively reduce the nitrile moiety in the presence of a carboxylic ester moiety.<br>
[0026]	In a closely related embodiment of this metal hydride process, the<br>
ester moiety of the amino compound of formula 6 is hydrolyzed before reducing the nitrile group with a metal hydride. For example the alkyl ester of the amino compound<br><br>
of formula 6 is saponified to give a carboxylate salt. The nitrile is then selectively reduced to the amine by treatment with hydride reagents such as NaBH3(02CCF3), and other such modified borohydride and aluminum hydride reagents that selectively reduce the nitrile moiety in the presence of a carboxylic acid or acid salt.<br>
[0027] In another embodiment of Process A (Scheme 2, Route II), the compound of formula 5 is directly hydrogenated to form the diamino compound of formula 7 using a heterogeneous transition metal catalyst, e.g., platinum on carbon, using hydrochloric acid and a solvent such as ethanol.<br>
[0028] In Process B, the compound of the formula 6 is converted to the compound of formula 1 via the lactam compound of the formula 10 (Scheme 3). In this instance, compound of formula 6 (e.g., wherein Rl=ethyl) is treated with a base metal catalyst under neutral conditions to reduce the nitrile moiety to an amino moiety. Base metal catalysts effective for the nitrile reduction include nickel-, cobalt-, or copper-aluminum alloy catalysts. A preferred catalyst is a cobalt-aluminum alloy catalyst such as that sold as Raney cobalt catalyst by Engelhard Corporation. Suitable solvents for the reduction include ethanol, methyl t-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, isopropanol, and the like. The lactam is hydrolyzed under basic conditions such as 10 N hydroxide solution or under acidic conditions using a suitably strong acid such as 12 N HC1. Preferably the lactam is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions using a mineral acid. DFMO is conveniently isolated as its monohydrochloride monohydrate salt as described above.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
 [0029] In Process C, the nitrile moiety of the compound of the formula 5 (preferably wherein R2 is aryl) is reduced to an amine before the 2-amino protecting group is removed (Scheme 4). Compound of the formula 5 is treated with a base metal catalyst to reduce the nitrile moiety and provide the compound of the formula 11. Base<br>
metal catalysts that can be used for this reduction reaction include nickel-, cobalt-, or copper-aluminum alloy catalysts. Preferably the catalyst is a cobalt-aluminum alloy catalyst. Solvents useful in the reduction reaction include alcohols, e.g., ethanol and ethers, e.g., methyl t-butyl ether. The Schiff s base can be removed by acid hydrolysis, as described above for Process A, and the ester group is further removed to complete the preparation of DFMO.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
 [0030]	In Process D, the amino protecting group in the compound of<br>
formula 5, is switched from a Schiff s base protecting group to an amide (or carbamate) protecting group (Scheme 5). The compound of the formula 8, wherein R4 is linear or branched C1 to C4 alkyl, alkoxy or aryl, is obtained by treating the compound of formula 5 with suitable acylating reagents. The acylating agents include anhydrides, acid chlorides, chloroformates, activated esters, e.g. N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, or other acylating agents well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably the acylating reagent is acetic anhydride so that R4 is methyl in the compound of formula 8. The acylation reaction can be performed in ethers, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, esters (e.g., ethyl acetate) as well as other solvents, in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
 [0031]	The nitrile group of the compound of formula 8 is then reduced<br>
using procedures analogous to those described above for Process A to provide the compound of formula 9. Although the compound of formula 9 can be isolated and further purified, it can be conveniently used in the next step without further purification. In the final step, the ester and amide moieties of the compound of formula 9 are hydrolyzed to provide DFMO. The hydrolysis can be accomplished by first hydrolyzing the carboxylic acid ester moiety with aqueous base followed by acid hydrolysis of the amide moiety with, for example, mineral acids. Alternatively, both the ester and amide moieties are hydrolyzed simultaneously using acidic conditions, e.g., 12 N HC1. DFMO can be isolated and further purified as its monohydrochloride monohydrate salt as described above.<br>
[0032]	It can be recognized that the compound of formula 1 or its synthetic<br>
precursors can be resolved into its individual isomers by resolution techniques well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the lactam of the compound of formula can be formed, i.e., the compound of formula 10, and then the acid addition salt of the lactam can be prepared with a homochiral acid such as (+) or (-) binaphthylphosphoric acid as described in US Patent No. 4,309,442. Other resolving agents, i.e., homochiral acids, well-known in the art could also be employed. Alternatively, chiral reversed phase chromatography techniques can be used to resolve the product if desired.<br>
[0033]	DFMO is typically produced by the process of the invention as a<br>
salt. The salt can be exchanged by a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as needed to provide the desired formulation.<br>
[0034]	The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but<br>
of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>
