				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to Six stroke engines. Conventionally four strokes engines are used in variety of automobile applications.<br>
The efficiency of the engine can be improved by making the crankshaft to rotate three times in one cycle. This can be achieved by adding one Buffer stroke and one Retake stroke in between Power and Exhaust strokes.<br>
There are two kinds of systems explained in this specification.<br>
1.	Six stroke 2 valve system<br>
2.	Six stroke 4 valve system<br>
The nature of the invention and the manner in which the invention operates is explained in detail in the following description.<br>

six stroke engine. Suction stroke. Fig. 2 - Cut sectional view of Compression Stroke Fig 3 - Cut sectional view of Power Stroke.

Fig 14 - Top view and side view of camshaft in Two valve system.<br>
This machine is an advanced version of the existing 4 stroke engine. Generally in 4 stroke engine one Power Stroke crank moves twice.<br>
In this newly developed machine there are 6 strokes. In one power Stoke, Crank rotates 3 times, this is achieved by providing two additional stroke i.e Buffer stroke and Retake stroke. In a 4 Stroke engine 1600 RPM are exactly 800 power strokes are required, where as in 6 stroke engine only 533.33 power strokes are required to achieve same RPM. In this 6 stroke engine crank shaft rotates 1080 degrees, and camshaft rotates 360degrees. Camshaft is set at 60 degree in each stroke, whereas in 4 stroke engine it is at 90 degree in each stroke, whereas in 6 stroke engine it is at 60 degree from this approximately 50% of fuel can be saved.<br>
When this 6 stroke system is adopted to a any engine the main advantage is less pollution and less vibration, besides having approximately 50% of savings on fuel, which is obtained by reducing the power stroke by 30 % (comparing to the conventional 4 stroke engine).<br>
1.	INTAKE STROKE<br>
This is the first movement of piston (16). This is a downward motion of the piston (16) that sucks are fuel mixture into the cylinder (15) through the open intake valve (6). Then operation s controlled by a camshaft cam lob No. 1. (5).<br>
2.	COMPRESSION STROKE<br>
During this second stroke, all valves (6 &amp; 11) are closed. This allows all of the pistons (16) force to be used to compress the air and fuel mixture. As it is compressed the mixture becomes more dense creating a more potent mixture for detonation.<br>
3.	POWER STROKE<br>
Just before the piston (16) reaches top dead center, the mixture is ignited by a spark plug (14). The third stroke, the power stroke harnesses the energy of the explosion by allowing the piston (16) to be forced downward from top dead center. This linear motion is changed to rotational motion by the crankshaft (20).<br>
4.	BUFFER STROKE<br>
The forth stroke of this engine is the Buffer stroke. During this upward movement of the piston(16) the exhaust value(l 1) is open. This piston (16) forces all of the burned gasses from the previous explosion out of the cylinder (15) which moves cam lob No.2 (12)<br>
5.	RETAKE STROKE<br>
This is the fifth movement of the piston (16). This is a downward motion of the piston that retakes burned gasses into the cylinder (15) from exhaust line (13) for this function exhaust valve (11) is opened and inlet valve (F) is closed. During this fifth stroke. To facilitate this function extra lobs have been added in camshaft (4), cam lob No.3.<br>
6.	EXHAUST STROKE<br>
The last stroke is the exhaust stroke (16) to create this function extra lobs have been added in camshaft (4) Cam lob No.3 (10) so crankshaft (20) rotates again at 180 degree. During this last upward movement of the piston (16) the exhaust valve (11) is open. The piston (16) forces all the burned gases out of the cylinder (15). The cycle s completed and can being again.<br>
SOME EXPLANATION ON HOW THE 6 STROKE ENGINE WORKS<br>
When the piston moves down fresh air and fuel are sucked inside the cylinder from the carburetor through the open inlet valve. When the piston moves up again the valves are closed and the air fuel mixture is compressed. When the piston reaches its highest position the spark plug produces a spark that ignites the fumes and causes an explosion. Because of the power of explosion the piston is pushed back. When the piston moves back up again the exhaust valve is opened and the fumes are pushed out of the cylinder. When the piston moves down these fumes are retaken into the cylinder from exhaust line, this time exhaust valve is opened. During the last upward movement of the piston the exhaust valve is opened and the fumes are pushed out of the cylinder. Now all the process restarts exactly after the 6 stroke.<br>
To enable this system to obtain three rotations of crank shaft (20) sprocket 14 teeth (19) is fitted. With the help of timing chain (18) a sprocket wheel with 42 teeth (7) is rotated. This sprocket wheel with 42 teeth (7) is fitted to a Camshaft (4) and through Rocker arm (8) opening and closing of valves takes place.<br>
6 STROKE 4 VALVE SYSTEM<br>
This machine is an advanced version of the existing 4 stroke engine. Generally in 4 stroke engine one power stroke crank moves twice.<br>
In this newly developed machine there are 6 strokes. In one power stroke, crank rotates 3 times, this is achieved by providing two additional stroke i.e AIR INTAKE AND AIR EXHAUST. For this additionally two more valves are provided. In a 4 stroke engine 1600 RPM are exactly 800 power strokes are required, whereas in 6 stroke engine only 533.33 power strokes are required to achieve same RPM. In this 6 stoke engine crank shaft rotates 1080 degree, and cam shaft rotates 360 degrees. Camshaft is set at 60 degree in each stoke, whereas in 4stroke engine it is at 90 degree from this approximately 50% of fuel can be saved.<br>
When this 6 stroke system is adopted to a any engine the main advantage is less pollution and less vibration, besides having approximately 50% of savings on fuel, which is obtained by reducing the power stroke by 30% (Comparing to the conventional 4 stroke engine)<br>
1.	IN TAKE STROKE<br>
This is the first movement of the piston (912). This is a downward motion of the piston (12) that sucks air fuel mixture into the cylinder (11) through the open intake valve (3).<br>
2.	COMPRESSION STROKE<br>
During this second stroke, all valves (3,4,6, &amp; 7) are closed. This allows all of the pistons (12) force to be used to be used to compress the air and fuel mixture. As it is compressed the mixture becomes more dense creating a more potent mixture for detonation.<br>
3.	POWER STROKE<br>
Just before the piston (12) reaches top dead center, the mixture is ignited by a spark plug (5). The third stroke, the power stroke harnesses the energy of the explosion by allowing the piston (12) to be forced downward from top dead center. This linear motion is changed to rotational motion by the crankshaft (19)<br>
4.	EXHAUST STROKE<br>
The forth stroke of this engine is the exhaust stroke. During this upward movement of the piston (12) the exhaust value (7) is open. The piston (12) forces all of the burned gasses from the previous explosion out of the cylinder (11).<br>
5.	AIR IN TAKE STROKE<br>
This is the fifth movement of the piston (12). This is a downward motion. During this time Air intake valve (5) is open and sucks only air through the air inlet port (2) in to the cylinder (11) this and creates more oxygen content in the cylinder (11). It results better combusting in next cycle.<br>
6.	AIR FINAL EXHAUST STROKE<br>
This is the last movement of the piston (12). During the upward movement of the piston (12) forces to the air out of the cylinder (11) through the open Air exhaust valve (6) then the cycle is completed.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION Comparison between Four Stroke Engine and Six Stroke Engine.<br>
1.	In four stroke engine one power stroke can rotate crank shaft two times, whereas in six stroke engine one power stroke can rotate Crank Shaft three times, this is achieved by adding one Buffer Stroke and Retake Stroke. In four valve system one Air Intake Stroke and Air Final Exhaust Stroke is added.<br>
2.	Comparing to four stroke engine 50% of mileage is achieved by rotating the crankshaft at 360°<br>
3.	Comparing to four strokes engine six stroke engine has minimum vibration.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
