DESCRIPTION<br>
ADHESIVE COMPOSITION FOR SOFT TISSUES, ADHESIVE COMPOSITION FOR WOUND<br>
DRESSING OR WOUND DRESSING COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to an adhesive composition for soft tissues, an adhesive composition for wound dressing or a wound dressing composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]     As soft tissue adhesives, adhesives for wound dressing or wound dressings, various compositions, e.g., compositions containing cyanoacrylate and compositions using materials derived from organisms, such as compositions containing fibrin and compositions containing albumin, have been studied in the past (see, for example, patent literature 1 and patent literature 2).<br>
[0003] The compositions containing cyanoacrylate are excellent in view of high adhesive strength, but they have poor biocompatibility, and there is a serious problem that formaldehyde generated by hydrolysis of cured products of the compositions exhibits high toxicity to organisms and inhibits healing. Particularly in parts that come into direct contact with central nervous system, blood vessels, etc., these compositions cannot be used. Moreover, since the curing time is extremely short, they are sometimes difficult to<br>
 <br>
2<br>
use.<br>
[0004] The compositions containing materials derived from organisms are excellent in that the biocompatibility is high and healing is rarely inhibited, but they have low adhesive strength. Further, when the composition containing fibrin is used as an adhesive or the like, there is a side view that fibrin glue contained in the composition becomes a culture medium for bacteria, so that there is the risk of infection after operation or treatment and there is a fear of harmfulness.<br>
[0005] When an adhesive is used for a wound of the skin or a soft tissue, or when a wound dressing is used for a wound, it is a usual way that the components are mixed in advance in a container or the like to prepare a composition and then the composition is applied to the surface of the soft tissue, the wound dressing part or the like, taking into consideration workability, prevention of infection, etc. However, the state of the composition after mixing sometimes has influence on the workability during the application of the composition, that is, for example, if the viscosity of the composition is too high, the composition is hard to apply, or if the viscosity is too low, the composition runs out of the necessary area. Moreover, if properties, such as elasticity and tensile elongation, of a film obtained by polymerization and solidification of the adhesive or the wound dressing are not proper, there sometimes occurs a problem that the film peels off from the skin after application because the skin<br>
 <br>
3<br>
or the soft tissue is a flexible adherend.<br>
[0006]     Since acrylic adhesives using an initiator containing an organoboron compound have low toxicity and low hairmfulness and have high adhesive strength, development of them to dental applications has been promoted (see, for example, patent literature 3). However, if other medical applications, such as surgical applications, soft tissue adhesion applications and wound dressing applications, are intended, further improvement in handling stability or workability of the composition between mixing of the components and application to the application area has been sometimes required.<br>

Solution to Problem<br>

monomers having a phosphoric acid group, such as (2-(meth)acryloxyethyl)phosphoric acid, (2-(meth)acryloxyethylphenyl)phosphoric acid and 10-(meth)acryloxydecylphosphoric acid; and<br>
monomers having a sulfonic acid group, such as p-styrenesulf onic acid and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid.<br>
[0054]     Of these monomers having an acidic group, 4-methacryloxyethyltrimellitic acid and its anhydride are preferable.<br>
[0055] These monomers having an acidic group can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. By the use of these monomers having an acidic group, the adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition tends to have more improved adhesion properties.<br>
[0056] The monomer having an acidic group is preferably contained in an amount of 1 to 20 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight, still more preferably 1 to 8 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the (meth) acrylate<br>

(having no acidic group) and the monomer having an acidic group. If the amount thereof is out of the above range, an evil influence is sometimes exerted on the adhesive strength or the biocompatibility,<br>
[0057] The amount of the monomer (A) is preferably in the range of 10 to 98,95 parts by weight, more preferably 25 to 89.5 parts by weight, still more preferably 37 to 86 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the later-described polymer (B) and the later-described polymerization initiator composition (C).<br>
[0058] If the amount of the monomer (A) is less than the lower limit of the above range, the viscosity is increased, and application tends to be difficult. If the amount of the monomer (A) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, the adhesive strength is poor, and there is a possibility that the mixture runs out of the desired area to obstruct the treatment.<br>
[0059] In some cases, the amount of the monomer (A) is preferably in the range of 5 to 98. 95 parts by weight, more preferably 17 to 98.5 parts by weight, still more preferably 20 to 85 parts by weight, particularly preferably 24 to 85 parts by weight, much more preferably 24 to 48 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A) , the later-described polymer (B) andthelater-describedpolymerization initiator composition (C) .<br>
[0060] If the amount of the monomer (A) is less than the lower limit of the above range, the viscosity is increased, and<br>
 <br>
20<br>
operations such as application tend to become difficult. If the amount of the monomer (A) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, adhesive strength and other properties, such as flexural elastic modulus, tensile strength and flexural strength, tend to become poor. Moreover, there is a possibility that the mixture runs out of the desired area to obstruct the treatment.<br>
[0061]     In the adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition of the present invention, a polymer (B) is further contained.<br>
[0062] Examples of the polymers (B) include methacrylate polymers, acrylate polymers, styrene-based elastomers, vinyl chloride-based elastomers, olef in-based elastomers, polyester-based elastomers, polyamide-based elastomers, urethane-based elastomers, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and a silicon polymer. These polymers can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0063]     Of these polymers (B) , preferable are methacrylate polymers and acrylate polymers from the viewpoint of homogeneity in the mixing process. The methacrylate polymers and the acrylate polymers are sometimes generically referred to as "(meth)acrylate polymers" hereinafter.<br>
[0064]     Examples of the (meth) acrylate polymers include:<br>
uncrosslinked polymers, such as polymethyl (meth)acrylate, polyethyl (meth)acrylate, a methyl (meth)acrylate/ethyl<br>
 <br>

crosslinked polymers, such as a methyl (meth) acrylate/ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate copolymer, a methyl<br>
(meth) acrylate/triethylene glycol di (meth) acrylate copolymer and a copolymer of methyl (meth)acrylate and a butadiene-based monomer.<br>
[0065] When the rubbers, such as natural rubbers and synthetic rubbers, and the elastomers, such as thermoplastic elastomers, among the above polymers are used by mixing them with the (meth)acrylate polymer, they function as flexibilizers and can enhance flexibility of the composition. Examples of the synthetic rubbers include EPT (ethylene/propylene/terpolymer). Examples of the thermoplastic elastomers include styrene-based elastomers, vinyl chloride-based elastomers, olef in-based elastomers, polyester-based elastomers, polyamide-based elastomers, urethane-based elastomers, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and a silicon polymer.<br>
[0066] The molecular weight of the above elastomer is usually in the range of 1, 000 to 1, 000,000, preferably 2, 000 to 500, 000. The glass transition point (Tg) of the elastomer is usually not higher than 20°C, preferably not higher than 0°C.<br>
[0067]     In the (meth)acrylate polymers, organic or inorganic composites in which metal oxides or metal salts are coated with above-mentioned uncrosslinked polymers or crosslinked polymers<br>
 <br>
22<br>
are further included.<br>
[ 0068 ] The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer, typically, the (meth)acrylate polymer, is preferably in the range of 1,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably 50,000 to 500,000, still more preferably 100,000 to 500,000. The above molecular weight is a molecular weight in terms of standard polymethyl methacrylate, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
[0069] The polymer (B) maybe composed of polymer particles. When the polymer (B) is composed of polymer particles, they may be polymer particles of plural kinds.<br>
[0070] Examples of such polymer particles include polymer particles (bl) having a weight-average molecular weight of 30^10' to 60x10* and a specific surface area of 1.5 to 4.5 (m^/g), polymer particles (b2) having a weight-average molecular weight of 5x10' to 20x10* and a specific surface area of 0.51 to 1.2 (m^/g) , and polymer particles (b3) having a weight-average molecular weight of 5x10* to 20x10* and a specific surface area of 0.1 to 0.5 (m^/g).<br>
[0071] The specific surface area of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably in the range of 1.5 to 4.5 (m^/g), more preferably 2.0 to 4.0 (mVg) .<br>
[0072] The specific surface area of the polymer particles (b2) is preferably in the range of 0.51 to 1.2 (m^/g), more preferably 0.6 to 1.0 (mVg) .<br>
[0073]      The specific surface area of the polymer particles<br>
 <br>
23<br>
(b3) is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 (m^/g), more preferably 0.2 to 0.45 (mVg) .<br>
[0074]     The volume mean particle diameter of the polymer<br>
particles (bl) is usually in the range of 1 to 50 {\m),  preferably<br>
5to40 (vim) . Thevolumemeanparticlediameterof thepolymerparticles<br>
{b2) is usually in the range of 0.1 to 40 (vim), preferably 1 to 20<br>
(vim) . The volume mean particle diameter of the polymer particles<br>
(b3) is usually in the range of 1 to 50 (vim) , preferably 5 to 40 (pm) .<br>
[0075] When the polymer (B) is a polymer mixture composed of the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3), and if necessary, the polymer particles (bl), the total amount of the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) is preferably not less than 2% by weight, more preferably not less than 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer particles (bl) , the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) . The polymer mixture is sometimes composed of the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) in the total amount of 100% by weight.<br>
[0076] When the total amount of the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) is not less than the lower limit of the above range, the polymer (B) is apt to be homogeneously dispersed in the monomer (A) and is more excellent in solubility in the monomer (A) . Moreover, application of the composition to a wound or a soft tissue is made easier, and spreading of the composition over the surface of a wound or a soft tissue after the application tends to become<br>
 <br>
24<br>
smaller.<br>
[0077] When the polymer particles (bl) is contained in the polymer particles, the total amount of the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) is preferably not more than 99% by weight, more preferably not more than 95% by weight, still more preferably not more than 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer particles (bl) , the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3).<br>
[0078] When the polymer particles (bl) is contained in the polymer particles, the content of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably not more than 98% by weight, more preferably not more than 95% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer particles (bl) , the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3) . The content of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably not less than 1% by weight, more preferably not less than 5% by weight, still more preferably not less than 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer particles (bl) , the polymer particles (b2) and the polymer particles (b3).<br>
[007 9] The amount of the polymer (B) is preferably in the range of 1 to 70 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 65 parts by weight, still more preferably 13 to 65 parts by weight, much more preferably 13 to 60 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C).<br>
 <br>
25<br>
that the mixture runs out of the desired area to obstruct the treatment. If the amount of the polymer (B) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, mixing with the monomer (A) becomes difficult. Further, because of rapid increase of viscosity, extrusion of the mixture from thecontainer tends to become difficult. Furthermore, polymerization proceeds to immediately form a polymerization cured product in some cases, so that the composition tends to be not excellent in operability as an adhesive or a wound dressing,<br>
[0081] When the polymer (B) is a (meth)acrylate polymer, the amount of the (meth) acrylate polymer is sometimes in the range of preferably 1 to 75 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 73 parts by weight, still more preferably 10 to 73 parts by weight, much more preferably 15 to 73 parts by weight, particularly preferably 13 to 68 parts by weight, most preferably 21 to 64 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the (meth)acrylate polymer and the later-described polymerization initiator composition (C).<br>
[0082] If the amount of the (meth)acrylate polymer is less than the lower limit of the above range, adhesive strength and other properties, such as flexural elastic modulus, tensile strength, compression strength and flexural strength, tend to become poor. If the amount of the (meth)acrylate polymer exceeds the upper limit of the above range, the viscosity is increased, and operations, such as application and injection, tend to become difficult.<br>
 <br>
26<br>
[0083] When the polymer (B) is a (meth) acrylate polymer and is a mixture of the polymer particles (bl), (b2) and (b3), the following embodiments are preferable under the conditions that the total amount of the polymer particles (bl), (b2) and (b3) is 100% by weight and the total amount of the polymer particles (b2) and {b3) is not less than 2% by weight, preferably not less than 5% by weight.<br>
[0084] When the amount of the polymer (B) is not less than 13 parts by weight but less than 28 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), the amount of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably in the range of 10% by weight to 95% by weight, more preferably 15% by weight to 95% by weight, still more preferably 38% by weight to 95% by weight, the amount of the polymer particles (b2) is preferably not more than 90% by weight, more preferably not more than 85% by weight, still more preferably not more than 62% by weight, and the amount of the polymer particles (b3) is preferably not more than 90% by weight, more preferably not more than 85% by weight, still more preferably not more than 62% by weight;<br>
when the amount of the polymer (B) is not less than 28 parts by weight but less than 68 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) , the amount of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably in the range of 10% by weight to 95%<br>
 <br>
27<br>
by weight, more preferably 10% by weight to 80% by weight, still more preferably 10% by weight to 60% by weight, the amount of the polymer particles (b2) is preferably not more than 90% by weight, and the amount of the polymer particles (b3) is preferably not more than 80% by weight, more preferably not more than 75% by weight; and<br>
when the amount of the polymer (B) is not less than 33 parts by weight but less than 68 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) , the amount of the polymer particles (bl) is preferably less than 10% by weight, more preferably not more than 8% by weight, still more preferably not more than 5% by weight, the amount of the polymer particles (b2) is preferably not more than 100% by weight, more preferably 20% by weight to 100% by weight, and the amount of the polymer particles (b3) is preferably not more than 100% by weight, more preferably not more than 80% by weight.<br>
[0085] The adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition of the present invention is characterized by using the later-described organoboron compound (cl) as the initiator composition (C) contained, and when the organoboron compound is added to a composition containing a monomer, polymerization reaction begins slowly in a relatively early stage and proceeds. This greatly differs from a case of using, a peroxide as a polymerization initiator where<br>
 <br>
28<br>
a relatively long time is required for the beginning of polymerization even if the polymerization initiator is added, and if the polymerization reaction once begins, the reaction proceeds rapidly and is completed in a relatively short time. In order to prepare a composition that is preferably used for wounds, soft tissues, etc., therefore, it is important to use such a polymer (B) of the present invention in such an amount as described above based on the monomer (A) . By the use of such a polymer (B) , not only can workability be ensured over a long time but also fluidity and application properties that are preferable in use for wounds, soft tissues, etc. canbe ensured.<br>
[0086]     The polymerization initiator composition (C) contained in the adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition of the present invention contains an oragnoboron compound (cl) as an essential component, and can contain an aprotic solvent (c2) and an alcohol (c3), when needed. Since the polymerization initiator composition (C) containing the organoboron compound (cl) is contained in the composition of the present invention, a residue of the monomer (A) tends to be smaller when the whole composition is cured after application of the composition to a wound, a soft tissue or the like, as compared with a composition using a peroxide as a polymerization initiator. Further, a part of it penetrates into the epithelium and begins to undergo polymerization. Hence, the composition of the present invention is favorably used for organisms.<br>
 <br>
29<br>
[0087]     Examples of the organoboron compounds (cl) include trialkylboron, alkoxyalkylboron, dialkylborane and partially oxidized trialkylboron.<br>
[0088]     Examples of the trialkylborons include trialkylborons having an alkyl group of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as triethylboron, tripropylboron, triisopropylboron, tributylboron, tri-sec-butylboron, triisobutylboron, tripentylboron, trihexylboron, triheptylboron, trioctylboron, tricyclopentylboron and tricyclohexylboron. The alkyl group may be any of a straight-chain alkyl group, a branched alkyl group and a cycloalkyl group, and three alkyl groups contained in the trialkylboron may be the same or different.<br>
[0089]     The alkoxyalkylboron is, for example, monoalkoxydialkylboron or dialkoxymonoalkylboron. Specifically, the alkoxyalkylboron is, for example, monoalkoxydialkylboron such as butoxybutylboron. The alkyl group of the alkoxyalkylboron may be the same as or different from the alkyl part of the alkoxy group.<br>
[0090]     Examples of the dialkylboranes include dicyclohexylborane and diisoamylborane. Two alkyl groups of the dialkylborane may be the same or different. Two alkyl groups contained in the dialkylborane may be bonded to form a monocyclic structure or a bicyclo structure. Examples of such compounds include 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.<br>
[0091]      The partially oxidized trialkylboron is a<br>
 <br>
30<br>
partially oxidized product of the above trialkylboron. As the partially oxidized trialkylboron, partially oxidized tributylboron is preferable. As the partially oxidized trialkylboron, partially oxidized trialkylboron obtained by the addition of oxygen in an amount of preferably 0.3 to 0.9 mol, more preferably 0.4 to 0.6 mol, based on 1 mol of the trialkylboron can be used.<br>
[0092] Of the above organoboron compounds, tributylboron or partially oxidized tributylboron is preferable, and partially oxidized tributylboron is more preferable. When tributylboron or partially oxidized tributylboron is used as the organoboron compound (cl), not only is the operability of the composition improved but also the composition tends to have proper reactivity to organisms having moisture content. When tributylboron or partially oxidized tributylboron is used as the organoboron compound (cl) , further, the reaction is initiated and proceeds even in a place of high moisture content such as an organism, so that the monomer rarely remains on the interface between the adhesive or the wound dressing and an organism. Hence, the injurious properties to the organism are extremely little. Such organoboron compounds (cl) can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0093] In the polymerization initiator composition (C), an aprotic solvent (c2) maybe contained. Since the aprotic solvent is contained in the polymerization initiator composition (C) as above and the organoboron compound is diluted, exothermic properties of<br>
 <br>
31<br>
the organoboron compound (cl) having ignition properties become gentler to suppress ignition properties, and hence, handling of the composition during transportation, storage andmixing is facilitated. In the case where an extremely large amount of an adhesive or a wound dressing is used, rapid generation of heat can be inhibited because of proper lowering of the exothermic properties, and consequently, damage of an organism that is in contact with the adhesive or the wound dressing of the present invention tends to be decreased. The boiling point of the aprotic solvent (c2) at 1 atm is usually in the range of 30°C to 150°C, preferably 50°C to 120'C. If the boiling point is lower than the lower limit of the above range, the aprotic solvent is evaporated or scattered from the polymerization initiator composition during transportation or storage, and the ignition property suppressing effect of the organoboron compound (cl) tends to be lowered. If the boiling point exceeds the upper limit of the above range, a residue of the aprotic solvent in a cured product formed from the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention is increased, and consequently, the adhesion performance of the composition tends to be lowered.<br>
[0094] As the aprotic solvent {c2), a solvent that is unreactive to the organoboron compound (cl) and is capable of forming a homogeneous solution is preferable.<br>
[0095]     Examples of the aprotic solvents (c2) include: hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane.<br>
 <br>
32<br>
benzene and toluene;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons, such as fluorobenzene, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and so-called flons;<br>
ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran;<br>
ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and diethyl ketone ; and<br>
esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and isopropyl acetate.<br>
[0096] Of these, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane and heptane, ethers and esters are preferable, and hexane, diisopropyl ether and ethyl acetate are more preferable.<br>
[0097] These aprotic solvents (c2) can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0098] The content of the aprotic solvent (c2) in the polymerization initiator composition (C) is preferably in the range of 30 to 80 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound (cl).<br>
[0099] If the content of the aprotic solvent (c2) is less than the lower limit of the above range, satisfactory dilution effect is not obtained, and the effect to suppress generation of heat or ignition tends to be insufficient. On the other hand, if the content of the aprotic solvent (c2) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, polymerization initiation ability of the polymerization initiator<br>
 <br>
33<br>
composition (C) tends to become lower than needed.<br>
[0100] In the polymerization initiator composition (C) , an alcohol (c3) may be further contained in addition to the aprotic solvent (c2) . By adding a small amount of the alcohol (c3) to the polymerization initiator composition (C), the reaction by the oragnoboron compound (cl) is made still gentler without lowering the polymerization activity, and even if the composition is brought into contact with paper or the like in air, burning or ignition tends to be suppressed.<br>
[0101]     Examples of the alcohols (c3) include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and its isomers, n-butanol and its isomers, n-pentanol and its isomers, n-hexanol and its isomers, and n-heptanol and its isomers.<br>
[0102] Of these alcohols {c3) , alcohols of 4 or less carbon atoms, namely, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and its isomers, and n-butanol and its isomers are preferable, and ethanol and n-propanol are more preferable,<br>
[0103]     These alcohols (c3) can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds,<br>
[0104]     The content of the alcohol (c3) in the polymerization initiator composition (C) is preferably in the range of 0,2 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0.3 to 4.5 parts by weight, still more preferably 0.5 to 4 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound (bl).<br>
 <br>
34<br>
of 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0. 3 to 4 .5 parts by weight, still more preferably 0.5 to 4 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound     (cl).<br>
[0105] If the content of the alcohol (c3) is less than the lower limit of the above range, satisfactory dilution effect is not obtained, and the effect to suppress generation of heat or ignition tends to be insufficient. On the other hand, if the content of the alcohol (c3) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, polymerization initiation ability of the polymerization initiator composition (C) tends to become lower than needed.<br>
[0106] When the alcohol (c3) and the aprotic solvent (c2) are used in combination, the content of the aprotic solvent (c2) in the polymerization initiator composition (C) is preferably in the range of 5 to 40 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 30 parts by weight, still more preferably 10 to 25 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound (cl).<br>
[0107] If the content of the aprotic solvent (c2) is less than the lower limit of the above range based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound (cl), the effect to suppress generation of heat or ignition tends to be insufficient. On the other hand, if the content of the aprotic solvent (c2) exceeds the upper limit of the above range based on 100 parts by weight of the organoboron compound (cl), polymerization initiation ability of the polymerization initiator composition (C) tends to be lowered.<br>
 <br>
35<br>
1 to 3 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C).<br>
[0109]     If the amount of the polymerization initiator composition (C) is less than the lower limit of the above range, progress of polymerization is difficult, and the adhesion effect tends to become poor. If the amount of the polymerization initiator composition (C) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, there is a possibility of lowering viscosity because of dilution or a possibility of exerting evil influence on safety. Moreover, it is presumed that rapid polymerization proceeds to form a polymerization product immediately, and therefore, the composition tends to be not excellent in operability as an adhesive or a wound dressing.<br>
[0110] In the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition, other components may be further contained when needed, as long as they do not exert evil influence on the performance of the composition.<br>
[0111]     As one of the other components, a polymerization inhibitor (D) can be mentioned. Examples of the polymerization inhibitors (D) include hydroquinone compounds, such as hydroquinone and dibutylhydroquinone, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, phenols, such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, catechol, pyrogallol, benzoquinone, 2-hydroxybenzoquinone, p-methoxyphenol, t-butylcatechol, butylated hydroxyanisole.<br>
 <br>
36<br>
butylated hydroxytoluene and t-butylhydroquinone. Of these, a mixture of hydroquinone monomethyl ether and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol is preferably used.<br>
[0112]     Of these polymerization inhibitors (D), hydroquinone monomethyl ether is sometimes preferable from the viewpoint of good stability of the hydroquinone monomethyl ether itself.<br>
[0113] The above polymerization inhibitors (D) can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0114] When the polymerization inhibitor (D) is added, the amount thereof is preferably in the range of 10 to 5000 ppm, more preferably 50 to 1000 ppm, still more preferably 50 to 500 ppm, based on the whole amount of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition.<br>
[0115] It is also preferable to add the polymerization inhibitor (D) in an amount of 10 to 5000 ppm based on the monomer (A).<br>
[0116] By preparing such a composition, for example, when an adhesive is applied to an adherend, such as the affected part (affected part that is not dried because of exudate from the incised part) in the surgical operation, a wound or a soft tissue, the composition becomes more excellent in ensuring application properties and a proper curing time and can be more stably handled as an adhesive or a dressing than before. Moreover, the composition is excellent<br>
 <br>
37<br>
in workability.<br>
[0117]     Although the amount of the polymerization inhibitor (D) is as described above, the polymerization inhibitor (D) is more preferably added in an amount of 50 to 1000 ppm, still more preferably 50 to 500 ppm, based on the monomer (A) . By preparing such a composition, for example, the composition can be not only handled stably during application but also cured efficiently after application. If the content of the polymerization inhibitor (D) is less than the lower limit of the above range, curing takes place immediately after mixing of the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), and hence, application tends to become difficult. On the other hand, if the content of the polymerization inhibitor (D) exceeds the upper limit of the above range, polymerization initiation ability of the polymerization initiator composition (C) is lowered, and the curing time becomes longer than needed. Hence, medical use of the composition tends to become difficult.<br>
[0118] As one of the other components, an ultraviolet light absorber can be further mentioned. Examples of the ultraviolet light absorbers include:<br>
benzotriazole compounds, such as 2- (2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole, 2-(3',5'-di-tert-butyl-2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole, 2-(5'-tert-butyl-2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole.<br>
 <br>

[0135] The adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition of the present invention is characterized by having a viscosity of 0.4 to 75,000 cp within 30 seconds after mixing of the components (A), (B) and (C) and the components to be contained when needed.<br>
[0136] Since the viscosity is in the above range, the composition is easily applied as an adhesive or a wound dressing.<br>
[0137] From the viewpoints of operability and fluidity, the viscosity is preferably in the range of 0.4 to 10,000 cp, more preferably 1 to 10,000 cp.<br>
[0138] The adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention preferably has a viscosity of 10 to 1,000,000 cp, more preferably 20 to 1,000,000 cp, still more preferably 30 to 800,000 cp, 60 seconds after mixing of the components (A), (B) and (C) and the components to be contained when needed.<br>
[0139] Since the viscosity is in the above range, the composition can be easily extruded from a container as an adhesive or a wound dressing, and has excellent operability such as ease of application.<br>
 <br>
49<br>
[0140] The composition of the present invention is excellent in operability as an adhesive or a wound dressing, namely, application properties such as fluidity. Even if the composition of the present invention is compared with a composition using a peroxide as an initiator component, the operator tends to be able to ensure a longer time than the time necessary for the mixing operation, and also from this viewpoint, the composition of the present invention is excellent in operability,<br>
[0141] A film, which is obtained from the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention, is given 24 hours after the preparation of the composition and has a thickness of not less than 1 lam (preferably not more than 1 cm) , a length of not less than 25 mm and a width of not less than 2 mm, preferably has a flexural elastic modulus, as measured under the conditions of a test rate of 2 mm/min, of not more than 750 MPa, more preferably not more than 740 MPa, still more preferably not more than 730 MPa.

 <br>
50<br>
product may be preferably not less than 100 MPa, more preferably not less than 150 MPa, still more preferably not less than 200 MPa.<br>
[0143] A film, which is obtained from the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention, is given 24 hours after the preparation of the composition and has a thickness of not less than 1 pm (preferably not more than 1 cm) , a length of not less than 25 mm and a width of not less than 2 mm, preferably has a tensile elongation, as measured under the conditions of a test rate of 1 mm/min, of not less than 5%, more preferably not less than 15%, still more preferably not less than 25%.<br>

[0145] A cured product obtained from the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention provides a coating film having properties excellent for soft tissues or the skin, and is excellent in adhesion to the skin on the bending portions, namely, portions where flexing or bending of a joint or the like is made.<br>
[0146] In the present invention, the monomer (A), the polymer (B), the polymerization initiator composition (C) and the components to be contained when needed are previously mixed to prepare<br>
 <br>
51<br>
an adhesive composition or a wound dressing composition, and the composition can be used by applying it to a wound (affected part in the surgical operation, wound to be dressed), a soft tissue or the like.<br>
[0147] Whenthese components are mixed, the order of mixing is not specifically restricted, but it is preferable that the monomer (A) is first mixed with the polymerization initiator composition (C) and subsequently mixed with the polymer (B), from the viewpoint that the components can be homogeneously and stably mixed.<br>
[0148]     When the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition contains the polymerization inhibitor (D), it is preferable that a mixture of the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor (D) is first mixed with the polymerization initiator composition (C) and subsequently mixed with the polymer (B).<br>
[0149] Prior to or during curing of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention, the composition may be irradiated with electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, ionizing radiation (e.g., y^^sys) or electron rays, toperformsterilization. Irradiationwithvisiblelight is sometimes desirable because the visible light does not greatly change the curing conditions. Sterilization may be carried out by treatment with gas, such as dry heat, steam, ethylene oxide (EO) or hydrogen peroxide, filtration, treatment with liquid, autoclave sterilization, or the like.<br>
 <br>
52<br>
[0150] Prior to application of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention to a wound, a soft tissue or the like, the surface of the wound, the soft tissue or the like may be disinfected with a disinfectant such as alcohol.<br>
[0151] Prior to application of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention to a wound, a soft tissue or the like, pretreatment may be further carried out for the purpose of improving adhesion properties. The pretreatment liquid is, for example, an aqueous solution containing 1 to 15% by weight of citric acid and 1 to 5% by weight of iron (III) chloride.<br>
[ 0152 ] When the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention is applied to a wound, the composition is polymerized and cured to fo2nn a film, and therefore, the composition can be used for bonding the wound or covering the surface of the wounded area (that is, after the wound edges are put together, the adhesive is applied to the surface of the wounded area, and it adheres to the surface and is cured) . For the purpose of fixing or protecting the edge or the whole of the cured film or maintaining or increasing the adhesive force, covering articles, such as film, sheet, paper, plaster, bondage and gauze, may be used during or after application of the composition to a wound, a soft tissue surface or the like. These covering articles may have adhesiveness, or may have tackiness.<br>
[0153]     The adhesive composition or the wound dressing<br>
 <br>
53<br>
composition can be applied to a wound during or after application of an alginate dressing material, a hydrogel or a hydropolymer to the wound.<br>
[0154] If there is a fear that the former the performance of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention varies because of preservation or storage of a long time, thereby impairing the effect of the present invention, it is possible that the components comprising the monomer (A) , the polymer (B), the polymerization initiator composition (C) and the components to be contained when needed, such as the polymerization inhibitor (D), are stored in the f02:m of a kit which is used as an adhesive for soft tissues, an adhesive for wound dressing or a wound dressing and has two or more members in which the above components are encased independently or in groups divided in an optional combination, and prior to use, the components are mixed to form the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition. The members for encasing the components therein are, for example, sealable resin containers having gas barrier properties in order to prevent evaporation or scattering of the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), or glass syringes. The members for encasing the polymer (B) therein are, for example, resin containers having good sealing properties or glass containers in order to prevent moisture absorption. As for the quantity to be encased, there is a case where the quantity that is used up one time is encased or a case where the quantity that is<br>
 <br>
54<br>
used plural times is encased.<br>

[0157] When a mixture of a monomer having an acidic group and a monomer having no acidic group is used as the monomer (A), the components may be stored in such a manner that the monomer having an acidic group is not in contact with the polymerization initiator composition, in addition to the above manners. Examples of such manners include a manner in which the components are divided into two groups consisting of a mixture of the monomer having an acidic group, the component (B) and the components to be contained when needed, and a mixture of the monomer having no acidic group and the component<br>

[0159] The constitution of the kit is not specifically restricted as long as there is no fear that the form or the performance is changed by the storage to impair the effect of the present invention, but the kit preferably has constitution in which the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) are each independently encased, and the monomer (A) is first mixed with<br>
 <br>
58<br>
the polymerization initiator composition (C) containing an organoboron compound and subsequently mixed with the polymer (B). By virtue of such constitution, an adhesive composition or a wound dressing composition having more stable performance tends to be obtained.<br>
[0160]     Examples of such kits include:<br>
a kit having members (e.g., containers, syringes) in which the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) are each independently encased and having a member (e.g., mixing container, mixing dish) for taking out the encased components from the members and mixing them; and<br>
a kit having one container which has three or more chambers separated by partitions, in said chambers the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) being each independently encased, and having a stirring unit for mixing the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) with the polymer (B), said components (A) and (C) having passed through a bypass formed in a syringe owing to rapture of the partitions or shifting of the partitions.<br>
[0161]     When the kit contains the polymerization inhibitor (D), the kit preferably has constitution in which a mixture containing the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor (D), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) are each independently encased, and the mixture containing the monomer (A)<br>
 <br>
59<br>
and the polymerization inhibitor (D) is first mixed with the polymerization initiator composition (C) containing an organoboron compound and subsequently mixed with the polymer (B) . By virtue of such constitution, an adhesive for soft tissues, an adhesive for wound dressing or a wound dressing having more stable performance tends to be obtained.<br>
[0162]     Examples of such kits include: a kit having members (e.g., containers, syringes) in which a mixture containing the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor (D) , the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition<br>
(C)	are each independently encased and having a member (e.g., mixing<br>
container, mixing dish) for taking out the encased components from<br>
the members and mixing them; and<br>
a kit having one container which has three or more chambers separated by partitions, in said chambers a mixture containing the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor (D), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) being each independently encased, and having a stirring unit for mixing the mixture containing the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor<br>
(D)	and the polymerization initiator composition (C) with the polymer<br>
(B), said mixture and said component (C) havingpassed through a bypass<br>
formed in a syringe owing to rapture of the partitions or shifting<br>
of the partitions.<br>
[0163]     The kit having one container wherein the components<br>
 <br>
60<br>
are encased in the separated three or more chambers requires less labor as compared with a means wherein the composition of the present invention is divided, placed in two or more members, typically containers, and mixed immediately before use. Moreover, this kit uses no mixing container or the like and can be economically used by taking a necessary amount of the composition out of the container and bringing it into contact with a jig such as sponge.<br>
[0164] It is also possible that a jig that is used for applying the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition to a wound, a soft tissue or the like is allowed to contain a part or the whole of the polymerization initiator composition (C) in advance, and the jig is brought into contact with the monomer (A) or a mixture containing the monomer (A) and the polymerization inhibitor (D), the polymer (B) and the components to be contained when needed to prepare the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition of the present invention in situ, followed by applying it to a wound, a soft tissue or the like.<br>
[0165] Examples of the jigs for applying the composition to a wound, a soft tissue or the like include a brush, a fiber ball, a cloth, a sponge ball and a piece of sponge,<br>
[0166] In the kit, the aforesaid disinfectant liquid such as alcohol, the aforesaid pretreatment liquid for improving adhesion properties, the aforesaid covering article, etc. may be included.<br>
[0167]     When the components of the composition are stored<br>
 <br>
61<br>
in the kit, they may be subjected to sterilization treatment with electromagnetic waves such as visible light preferably under the conditions that the components are not modified (e.g., monomer is not cured).<br>
[0168]     The adhesive composition for soft tissues, the adhesive composition for wound dressing or the wound dressing composition of the present invention can be used for, for example, adhesion of organism tissues, such as closure, protection or obstruction of wounds, fixing (adhesion) of soft tissue graft, hemostasis, vascular anastomosis, vascular obstruction, bronchial anastomosis, bronchial obstruction and ophthalmologic operations.<br>
[0169] By directly applying the composition of the present invention to a wound formed in the outer skin of an organism such as skin or mucous membrane, the opening of the wound can be easily closed. Moreover, the composition of the present invention can be used also for fixing a graft to the skin transplantation area in the skin transplantation.<br>
[0170] When the composition of the present invention is used as a wound dressing, the adhesive is not applied to the wound surface usually, but the adhesive is applied to the surface of the wounded area after the wound edges are put together, and it adheres to the surface and is cured. In the case of a wound having no incised surface, such as scratch, crush wound or contused wound, the composition may be directly applied to the affected part in order<br>
 <br>
62<br>
to dress the wound.<br>
Examples<br>
[0171]     The present invention is further described with reference to the following examples, but it should be construed that the present invention is in no way limited to those examples. Examples lA to 18A Reagents<br>
In the examples, the following compounds and composition were used as the monomer (A), the polymer (B) and the polymerization initiator composition (C).<br>
[0172]     Monomer (A): 4-META/MMA, methyl methacrylate solution of 4-methacryloxyethyltrimellitic anhydride (weight ratio: about 5%)<br>
Polymer (B): mixture of three kinds of the following PMMA (polymethyl methacrylates) (bl) to (b3) and pigment<br>
The weight ratios of these components are as follows: in 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the three kinds of PMMA and the pigment, (bl) is contained in an amount of 20.03 parts by weight, (b2) is contained in an amount of 62.5 parts by weight, (b3) is contained in an amount of 12.5 parts by weight, and the pigment is contained in the residual amount.<br>
Molecular weights and properties of the PMMA (1) to (3) are as follows.<br>
 <br>
63<br>
is contained in the residual amount.<br>
Molecular weights and properties of the PMMA	(bl)<br>
to (b3) are as follows.<br>
(bl)  weight-average molecular weight: 450,000, volume mean particle diameter: 26.7 \m\,   specific surface area: 2.913 m^/g<br>
(b2)  weight-average molecular weight: 140,000, volume mean particle diameter: 8.2 ]im,   specific surface area: 0.827 m^/g<br>
(b3) weight-average molecular weight: 140,000, volume mean particle diameter: 24.6 jam, specific surface area: 0.371 m^/g<br>
The volume mean particle diameter of PMMA (refractive index: 1.49) was measured in the following manner. As a dispersion medium, special grade reagent methanol (refractive index: 1.33, available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was used. The PMMA was dispersed in the dispersion medium by an ultrasonic homogenizer integrated in the apparatus for 5 minutes (output: 25 W), and the measurement was carried out under the concentration conditions of the proper range of the apparatus Loading Index at a circulation rate of 50% (100%: 65 ml/sec) by the use of Microtrac MT3300EXII (particle size distribution meter manufactured by Microtrac Inc.).<br>
[0173] The specific surface area is a value determined by nitrogen gas adsorption at the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using Autosorb 3 (manufactured by Quantachrome Instruments) , and is a value measured by BET method.<br>
[0174]      Polymerization initiator composition (C) : TBB A<br>
 <br>
64<br>
In a sample tube, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples lA to 9A of the following Table 1. In the sample tube in which the polymer (B) had been weighed, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), which had been mixed together in a different sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples lA to 9A of the following Table 1 similarly to the above, were injected, and they were mixed together at 25°C to prepare an adhesive composition or a wound dressing composition of the present invention. 30 seconds after the prepatation, viscosityof the composition wasmeasured. The viscosity at the time of preparation was not less than 0. 4 cp, and it was confirmed that the viscosity increased with time. The viscosity was measured by an E type viscometer (manufactured by Tokyo Keiki Inc., EHP type) at 25°C. The evaluation results are set forth in Table 1. [0175]     Evaluation of application properties<br>
In a syringe having a cap at the luer part, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples lA to 9A of the following Table 1. In this syringe, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), which had been mixed together in a sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples lA to 9A of the following Table 1 similarly to the above, were injected, and they were mixed together at 25°C. Thereafter, the cap of the syringe was removed, then a nozzle having a width of 1 cm and a thickness of 1 mm was fitted, and 1 ml of the composition<br>
 <br>
65<br>
mixed was applied by 4 cm onto a polyethylene sheet. The application properties were evaluated based on the 5-grade evaluation of 1 to 5. That is to say, a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1 cm but less than 1.2 cm was evaluated to be 5; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.2 cm but less than 1.4 cm was evaluated to be 4; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.4 cm but less than 1. 6 cm was evaluated to be 3; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.6 cm was evaluated to be 2; and a case where application was impossible was evaluated to be 1. The evaluation results are set forth in Table 1.<br>
[0176] It was confirmed that in the case of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition containing the components (A), (B) and (C) and having a viscosity of less than 0.4 cp after 30 seconds, the width of the applied composition was too large, and in the case of the composition having a viscosity of more than 75000 cp after 30 seconds, application using a syringe was impossible.<br>

[0178]     Preparation of polymerized and solidified film<br>
In a 5 ml sample tube, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Exan^sles lOA to 13A of the following Table 2 . In the sample tube in which the polymer (B) had been weighed, a mixture of the monomer solution (A), and the polymerization initiator composition (C) , which had been prepared in a different 1 ml sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples lOA to 13A of the following Table 1 similarly to the above, was introduced, and they were mixed together at 25°C for about 5 seconds using a glass bar so that the mixture might become homogeneous.<br>
[0179]     The resulting adhesive composition or wound dressing composition was in j ected into a syringe and immediately filled in a frame to prepare a sample film in accordance with the following procedure, as illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
[0180] On a glass plate, a sheet of PE Lumirror (trade mark) and a fluororesin frame having a thickness of 0.5 mm (internal size of frame: 25 mm (length) x 2 mm (width) ) were superposed in this order. In this frame, the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition prepared was filled. The filling work was carefully carried out so that bubbles should not be formed. After the filling was completed, a sheet of PE Lumirror (trade mark) and a glass plate were further superposed thereon in this order, and the four corners of the outermost two glass plates were fixed with clips. Thereafter, they were allowed to stand for 24 hours at 25°C (room temperature) ,<br>
 <br>
68<br>
and then the film was taken out of the frame. When the resulting film had irregularities on the surfaces, the surfaces were abraded with a waterproof abrasive paper # 600 to remove irregularities, whereby a sample film was prepared. The resulting sample film had a size of a length of 25 mm, a width of 2 mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm. [0181]     Flexural elastic modulus (test rate: 2 mm/min) and tensile elongation (test rate: 1 mm/min) (SS properties of film) of the sample film were determined by EzTest/CE manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation. The SS property values of the film are each a mean of values measured on four sample film strips. The evaluation results are set forth in Table 2.<br>

[0186]     Example 18A (evaluation of tissue-injurious properties using guinea pig<br>
The back skin of a Hartley type guinea pig of 5 weeks old, whose hair had been clipped and removed, was incised by 3 cm to 4 cm under anesthesia. In a syringe whose discharge opening had been closed with a cap, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example 18A of the following Table 4. Then, the monomer solution (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) were mixed in a sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Exan^sle 18A similarly to the above, and the mixture was injectedinto the syringe in which the polymer (B) had been introduced, and they were mixed together at 25°C. Thereafter, the cap of the syringe in which the three components of (A), (B) and (C) had been placed was removed, then a nozzle having an opening of a width of 1 cm and a thickness of 1 mm was fitted, and within 10 seconds, the adhesive composition mixed was extruded through the opening of the syringe nozzle to apply the composition to the incised wound of the guinea pig, said incised wound having been sealed by pressing down it with a finger,<br>
[0187] 30 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours and 168 hours after the treatment, properties of the wound, degree of redness and degree of expansion were examined, then the animal was subjected to mercy killing, and the skin of 1 cm x i cm was cut out from the applied part and fixed in formalin. Thereafter, a tissue<br>
 <br>
74<br>
slice was prepared in a conventional manner, then subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining and observed by an optical microscope,<br>
[0188]     As a result, there was no problem with the properties of the skin, and redness and expansion were not detected. In the observation of the tissue slice, inflammation caused by application of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition was not observed, and harmfulness to the skin tissue was not confirmed.

to be 4; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.4 cm but less than 1.6 cm was evaluated to be 3; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.6 cm but less than 1.8 cm was evaluated to be 2; a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 1.8 cm but less than 3 cm was evaluated to be 1; and a case where the width of the applied composition was not less than 3 cm was evaluated to be 0. The evaluation results are set forth in Tables 8 to 15. [0203]     Preparation of polymerized and solidified film<br>
In a 5 ml latex-free luer lock syringe (manufactured by HENKE SASS WOLF) having a plastic cap (manufactured by Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd.) at the luer part, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example IC, Example 3C, Example 4C, Example IOC, Example 15C, Example 17C, Example 19C, Example 22C, Example 23C, Example 27C and Example 28C of the following Tables 8 to 13. In this syringe, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) , which had been mixed together in a sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example IC, Example 3C, Example 4C, Example IOC, Example 15C, Example 17C, Example 19C, Example 22C, Example 23C, Example 27C and Example 28C similarly to the above, were injected, and the syringe was vigorously shaken with hand at 25°C for 20 seconds to mix the contents. The resulting composition was immediately filled in a frame to prepare a sample film in accordance with the following procedure, as illustrated in<br>
 <br>
83<br>
Fig. 1. On a glass plate, a sheet of PE Lumirror (trade mark) and a fluororesin frame having a thickness of 0.5 mm (internal size of frame: 25 mm (length) x 2 mm (width) ) were superposed in this order. In this frame, the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition prepared was filled. The filling work was carefully carried out so that bubbles should not be foirmed. After the filling was completed, a sheet of PE Lumirror (trade mark) and a glass plate were further superposed thereon in this order, and the four corners of the outermost two glass plates were fixed with clips. Thereafter, they were allowed to stand for 24 hours at 25°C (room temperature), and then the film was taken out of the frame. When the resulting film had irregularities on the surfaces, the surfaces were abraded with a waterproof abrasive paper #600 to remove irregularities, whereby a sample film was prepared. The resulting sample film had a size of a length of 25 mm, a width of 2 mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm.<br>
[0204]     Flexural elastic modulus (test rate: 2 mm/min) and tensile elongation (test rate: 1 mm/min) of the sample film were determined by an Autograph (EZ-SmanufacturedbyShimadzu Corporation) . The values of the flexural elastic modulus and the tensile elongation of the film are each a mean of values measured on four sample film strips. The evaluation results are set forth in Tables 8 to 13. [0205]     Evaluation of adhesive strength using YMP skin<br>
Test of adhesive strength was carried out based on ASTM F2255-05 using YMPskin (availablefromCharlesRiver Laboratories Japan, Inc.) .<br>
 <br>
84<br>
That is to say, YMP skin having a thickness of 2 to 3 mm, from which a fat layer had been removed, was cut into a size of 25 mm (width) X 20 mm (length), and both surfaces of the skin were wiped with paper. Then, the width of the skin was set to the edges of an acrylic plate having a size of 25 mm (weight) x 80 mm (length) , and the deinnis side of theskinwasbondedtotheplatewithAronAlpha (trademark, available from TOAGOSEI CO., LTD.) in such a manner that the outer skin was on the upper side. Thereafter, to the skin (outer skin) of an area having a length of not less than 10 mm from the edge of the acrylic plate in the longitudinal direction and to the side surface of the skin. Teflon Grease (trade mark) was applied to define an "adhesive application surface (25 mm (width) x lo mm (length))", whereby an adherend was formed. This adherend was wrapped up in gauze having been soaked with a physiological saline solution, then placed in a closed container and kept warm at 37°C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, in a 5 ml latex-free luer lock syringe (manufactured by HENKE SASS WOLF) having a plastic cap (manufactured by Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd.) at the luer part, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example IC, Example 3C, Example 4C and Example 17C of the following Table 8 and Table 11. In this syringe, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), which had been mixed together in a sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example IC, Example 3C, Example 4C and Example 17C similarly to the above, were injected, and the syringe<br>
 <br>
85<br>
was vigorously shaken with hand at 25°C for 20 seconds to mix the contents, whereby an adhesive composition or a wound dressing composition was prepared. The adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition was applied to the adhesive application surface (25 mm X 10 mm) . Two of such samples were prepared, and these were laid one upon the other in such a manner that the adhesive applied surfaces faced each other, and allowed to stand still for 1 hour under a load of 140 g. Thereafter, the resulting sample was wrapped up in gauze having been soaked with a physiological saline solution, placed in a container and allowed to stand still at 37 °C for 24 hours to prepare an adhesive strength evaluation sample.<br>
[0206] The evaluation sample was subjected to tensile test using an Autograph (EZ-S manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) at a test rate of 5 mm/min. A mean of values measured on four test strips was determined as adhesive strength. The evaluation results are set forth in Table 8 and Table 11. [0207]     Overall evaluation<br>
A case where the points of solubility and application properties (extrusion from container, spreading of applied composition) were each 3 or more was evaluated to be AA; a case where the points of solubility and application properties (extrusion from container, spreading of applied composition) were each 2 or more was evaluated to be A; acasewhere the points of solubility and application properties (extrusion from container) were each 2 or more and the point of<br>
 <br>
86<br>
application properties (spreading of applied composition) was 1 or more was evaluated to be B; and any of a case where the point of solubility was 1, a case where the point of application properties (extrusion from container) was 1, and a case where the point of application properties (spreading of applied composition) was 0 was evaluated to be C. The evaluation results are set forth in Tables 8 to 15.<br>

[0216]     Examples 32C to 34C, Comparative Example 5C Evaluation of tissue-injurious properties using rat<br>
AmaleCrl:CD (SD) rat (SPF, Charles river Laboratories Japan, Ltd.) of 11 weeks old, whose hair on the back had been clipped by electric hair clippers, was anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and the skin was sterilized by alcoholic cotton. In a 5 ml latex-free luer lock syringe (manufactured by HENKE SASS WOLF) having a plastic cap (manufactured by Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd.) at the luer part, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples 32C to 34C of Table 16. In this syringe, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C) , which had been mixed together in a 10 ml glass sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Examples 32C to 34C of       Table 16 similarly to the above, were injected, and the syringe was vigorously shaken with hand at 25°C for 20 seconds to stir and mix the contents. After the mixing, the plastic cap was removed, then a needle (18G) was fitted, and air was sufficiently removed from the syringe, followed by administration of 400 \il  under the skin (between dermis and subcutaneous fat) of the back. As a comparative example, 400 ]il  of a cyanoacrylate-based skin adhesive Dermabond (trademark, available from Johnson &amp; Johnson K.K,) was administered.  As a negative control, 400 |il of a physiological saline solution was administered.<br>
[0217]     72 hours or 168 hours after the administration, the rat was subjected to mercy killing, then the skin of the back<br>
 <br>
103<br>
at the subcutaneous administration part was extracted as it was without clipping the hair, and it was fixed in formalin. After the fixation, a paraffin embedded block was prepared, and it was subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining (lymphocyte staining), Congo red staining (eosinophil staining) and toluidine blue staining (mast cell staining), followed by microscopic observation. The tissue-injurious properties were evaluated by scores on the pathological findings (0: no findings, 1: soft, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe). The evaluation results are set forth in Table 16. [0218]     As a result, it was confirmed that moderate inflammation occurred by the contact of Dermabond (trade mark) with the subcutaneous tissue, but in the case of the adhesive composition or the wound dressing composition, inflammation was rarely observed. From this, it was confirmed that the composition had high safety as an adhesive for skins or a wound dressing.<br>

[0220]     Confirmation of healing of incised part using rat<br>
A male SD rat of 5 weeks old was anesthetized with Somnopentyl and then subjected to hair shearing. A penetrating skin cut wound of 30 mm was made at the position of 5 mm from the xiphoid process toward the tail. In a 5 ml latex-free luer lock syringe (manufactured byHENKESASSWOLF) having a plastic cap (manufacturedby Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd.) at the luer part, the polymer (B) was weighed in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example 34C of Table 16. In this syringe, the monomer (A) and the polymerization initiator composition (C), which had been mixed together in a 10 ml glass sample tube in accordance with a blending ratio described in Example 34C of Table 16similarly to the above, were injected, andthe syringe was vigorously shaken with hand at 25°C for 20 seconds to stir and mix the contents. Thereafter, the plastic cap was removed, then a nozzle having an opening of a width of 1 cm and a thickness of 1 mm was fitted. Bleeding at the cut wound was stopped using gauze, and then, with tightly pressing down the joined surface, 500 \il of the adhesive was applied thereto. 1 week, 2 weeks or 3 months after the treatment, the rat was subjected to mercy killing, and the abdominal tissue (skin and subcutaneous tissue) having a size of 3 cm (length) x 2 cm (width) was extracted and fixed in formalin. After the fixation, a paraffin embedded block wasprepared, and it was subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining, followed by evaluation of the degree of healing by microscopic observation.<br>
 <br>
106<br>
[0221] As a result, it was confirmed that the incised part where the adhesive for skins or the wound dressing composition had been applied did not differ from a non-incised tissue, and it had healed sufficiently.<br>
