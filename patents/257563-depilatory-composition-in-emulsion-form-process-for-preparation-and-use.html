DEPILATORY COMPOSITION IN EMULSION FORM, PROCESS FOR PREPARATION AND USE<br>
The present invention relates to depilatory compositions in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion; their preparation, and methods for their use in removing hair from the skin of humans.<br>
Compositions for removing superfluous body hair are know i and are of various types. One type of composition requires initial heating before being applied to the skin in a generally molten state. It is then allowed to solidify before being removed from the skin together with unwanted hair. This is known in the art as epilation, as the hairs are uprooted from the skin.<br>
Another type of composition is in the form of a cream, which can be applied to the skin at room temperature. The cream includes a substance that degrades hair keratin. Conventionally, the compositions are applied to the skin where unwanted hair is present, then left in place for a predetermined time to allow the keratin in the hair to become degraded. The composition along with degraded hair is then removed from the skin, usually with a tool such as a sponge or wipe or spatula. Such compositions are known in the art as depilatory compositions.<br>
If the depilatory composition is left in contact with the skin for excessive lengths of time, there is a risk that the composition may cause irritation of the skin in some users. If it is present for too short a time,<br><br>
degradation of keratin may be inadequate, leading to only partial removal of the unwanted hair. In this specification, the period the composition must be left in contact with the hairy skin to achieve adequate hair degradation is referred to as the degradation period. Typical degradation periods are in the range 3 to 15 minutes.<br>
In the art, the trend has been to make depilatory compositions sufficiently viscous so that they will stay in place on desired region of skin where superfluous hair removal is desired, without slipping to other regions of skin or falling, off during the degradation period. In parallel, there has also been a trend to make the compositions easier to rinse from the skin, so that once the degradation period is over, the composition and degraded hairs can be rinsed easily from the skin. See for example EP0855900.<br>
WO 99/02125 discloses depilatory compositions in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The preferred depilatory compound is cited as potassium thioglycolate. A pH regulator is present, the preferred pH regulator being lime (calcium hydroxide).<br>
A problem with prior art depilatory compositions arises from their ease of rinsing. The user generally applies the compositions in the bathroom by a bathtub, sink or shower, or even in a bath or shower, and must wait for several minutes before removing the composition, but is prevented from simultaneously carrying out any. other<br><br>
procedures which could lead to the composition being inadvertently rinsed away or partially rinsed away. This would potentially lead to patches of hair remaining on the skin. So, for instance, with prior art compositions, the user would be inhibited from applying the composition to their legs then washing their upper body, or shampooing their hair, or shaving their armpits during the degradation period. This can lead to a considerable lengthening of the total time required for ablutions when removal of superfluous hair is desired.<br>
It has now been found that these problems can be tackled by providing a depilatory composition which remains in place on the skin for enough time for hair degradation<br>
*<br>
to take place even when rinsed or immersed in water for short periods of time.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention provides a depilatory composition which is an emulsion of hydrophobic particles in a continuous aqueous phase wherein the aqueous phase comprises at least one depilatory agent and the hydrophobic particles comprise a fatty alcohol and an oil gelling agent.<br>
Surprisingly, the presence of the oil gelling agent along with the fatty alcohol in the hydrophobic particles of the composition leads to a considerable improvement in the adherence of the .composition to the ski*- even when subjected to a stream of rinsing water. It is surprising that the oil gelling agent, which is located in the discrete, hydrophobic particles of the<br><br>
composition, has such an influence on the rinse-ability of the compositions.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of hair removal from human skin which includes the steps of i) applying, preferably with an application tool, a composition according to the first aspect of .the invention to the skin where superfluous hair is present, ii) allowing the composition to remain in contact with the skin for a predetermined time, iii) removing the composition and- -degraded hair, preferably using a removal tool and preferably iv) washing the skin.<br>
Further aspects of the invention are concerned with processes for preparing the depilatory compositions and the:_r use . for degrading hair keratin in a wet environment, where there is risk of accidental rinsing away of the composition, such as a bathroom.<br>
The depilatory agent is a substance capable of degrading keratin. The depilatory agent, according to the present invention, may include a mixture of one or more depilatory agents. Preferred depilatory agents are sulfhydryl compounds, meaning a compound having an -S-H group. Suitable sulfhydryl depilatory agents include but are not limited to the group consisting of thioglycolic acid, cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, thioglycerol, thiomalic acid, 2- mercaptopropionic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, thiodiglycol, 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, thioxanthene, thiosalicylic acid, thiolactic acid, thiopropionic acid,<br><br>
thiodiglycolic acid, N-acetyl-L- cysteine, lipoic acid, and cosmetically- and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of any of the foregoing compounds.<br>
Preferred  sulfhydryl  compounds  include  thioglycolic acid,   cysteine",""  glutathione,  N-"  acetyl -L- cysteine, lipoic acid, thiosalicylic acid, and thiolactic acid and cosmetically- and/or pharmaceutically- acceptable salts thereof  More  preferred  sulfhydryl  compounds  include thioglycolic acid, cysteine, glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine  and  cosmetically-  and/or  pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The most preferred sulfhydryl compound-is -.thioglycolic acid and cosmetically - and/or pharmaceutically-  acceptable  salts  thereof.  As  used herein,    "cosmetically-    and/or    pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" of the sulfhydryl compounds include, but are not limited to alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium, lithium,  rubidium and potassium salts;  alkaline earth metal  salts,  e.g.,  magnesium,  calcium  and  strontium salts; non-toxic heavy metal salts, e.g., aluminum salts and zinc salts; boron salts;  silicon salts;  ammonium salts;  trialkylammonium salts,  e.g.,  trimethylammonium and triethylammonium; and tetralkylonium salts.<br>
Preferred cosmetically- and/or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the sulfhydryl compound include sodium, potassium and calcium salts. Most preferred salts of the sulfhydryl compound are potassium and calcium salts.<br><br>
Suitably, the composition comprises from 1 to 8% by weight, preferably from 2 to 6% by weight, of depilatory agent expressed as the acid form of the depilatory agent. For example, it is preferred that the composition comprises potassium glycolate at pH12.3, this is not expressed as potassium thioglycolate, but as the equivalent "weight of thioglycolic~acid.<br>
Optionally, the composition includes an accelerator that will ' accelerate  the  keratin  degradation  reaction.<br>
■Suitable, accelerators include urea, thiourea, dimethyl isosorbide,  ethoxydiglycol  and  methyl  propyl  diol.<br>
-Pre-fe-rably the .-accelerator. . is_. urea or methyl propyl diol, The composition according to the invention preferably comprises from 5% to 15% by weight, more preferably 7% to 10% by weight of an accelerator.<br>
It is particularly preferred for the composition to comprise a pH regulator to assist in activating the depilatory agent, particularly when the depilatory agent is a sulfhydryl compound. Preferably the quantity and type of pH regulator is chosen to maintain the pH of the composition at a value greater than 5, preferably greater than 7, more preferably from 8 to 13, most preferably from 10 to 12.9, especially from 12 to 12.7. For example, by ensuring that the pH is about 12.1 to 12.7,. depilation can occur within about 5 minutes, as desired by the user, without causing undue irritation. Higher pH levels can lead to irritation problems with some users.<br><br>
The pH regulator preferably is in the continuous aqueous phase (between the hydrophobic particles) when present. Examples of the pH regulator include arginine (especially L-arginine), silicates (e.g. sodium or potassium silicate), calcium hydroxide and polyethyleneimine. Mixtures of pH regulators may be used. It is particularly preferred for the pH regulator also to include calcium hydroxide in an amount from 2 to 4% by weight of the composition. The pH regulator may be dissolved in the aqueous phase of the composition or may be present as solid particles dispersed throughout .the composition.<br>
Compositions according to the invention comprise hydrophobic particles distributed as an emulsion (an oil-in-water emulsion) in an aqueous continuous phase which is a liquid at 25°C. By aqueous it is meant that the continuous phase comprises at least 5 0% by weight of water, preferably 70% by weight or more based on the total weight of the continuous phase. The amount of water in the composition as a whole will typically be from 40% to 95% by weight of the composition.<br>
The hydrophobic particles of the compositions of the invention may comprise non-polar oily or waxy materials which are insoluble in water (by insoluble is meant a solubility in water of 0.1% by weight or less at 25°C) but must comprise a fatty alcohol. Preferably, the alkyl/alkenyl chain of the fatty material is fully saturated. Suitable fatty alcohols comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22. A mixture of<br><br>

Suitably, compositions of the invention comprise less than 20%, preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than 11% by weight of fatty alcohol.<br>
The hydrophobic particles of the composition further<br>
-comprise an .oil	gelling agent.  Suitable oil  gelling<br>
agents include waxes having a melting point from 65 CC to 130°C, polymeric gelling agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compositions of the invention suitably comprise from 0.2 to 5%, preferably from 0.5 to 4% more preferably from 1 to 3% by weight of the oil gelling agent.<br>
Suitable waxes  include beeswax,  carnauba,  baysberry, candelilla,  montan,  ozokerite,  ceresin,  hydrogenated castor oil (castor wax), synthetic waxes such as Fisher-Tropsch  waxes,  microcrystalline  waxes,  and  mixtures thereof. Waxes such as triglycerides or glycol diesters<br>
of Ci8 to C36 fatty acids are also suitable as gelling<br>
agent for the oil phase.<br>
Suitable polymeric oil gelling agents include homopolymers and copolymers of polyethylene, and block<br><br>
copolymers of hydrocarbon- polyether- polyamide-or polyether-hydrocarbon types.<br>
A particularly preferred oil gelling agent is polyethylene in the form of a homopolymer. Preferably the polyethylene has a molecular weight * from 100 to 100 0, preferably "from 250 t"6"~8 00 more preferably from 3 00 to 600 unified mass units. This gives the advantage of ease of incorporation of the polyethylene into the hydrophobic particles of the invention by melting and blending. Polyethylene suitable for use in compositions of the invention is a substantially linear polymer with<br>
the structure CH3CH2 (CH2CH2) nCH2 C^3 / where n is a mean<br>
number from 2 to 26, preferably from 5 to 15. Preferably at least 90% by weight of the polyethylene is linear.<br>
Particles means finely divided parts, and encompasses solid particles, liquid particles and plastic or waxy particles. Preferably, the particles are solid at a temperature of 25°C or less. Preferably, the particles are liquid at a temperature of 80°C or more in order to facilitate  the  preparation  of  the  composition.  The<br>
hydrophobic particles suitably have a mean diameter D4/3<br>
as measured by laser light scattering (using apparatus such as a Malvern Mastersizer™) from 0.1 to 50 micrometres, preferably from 0.5 to 20 micrometres, more preferably from 1 to 10 micrometres.<br>
Preferably, compositions of the invention include an emulsifier  to  facilitate  the  emulsification  of  the<br><br>
hydrophobic particles in the continuous aqueous phase and to stabilise the emulsion against coalescence of the hydrophobic particles.

Suitable nonionic surfactants include alkyl ethers of "polyethylene glycol- and/or* — polypropylene glycol, including mixed ethers and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier is suitably present in an amount of from 2% to 10%, most preferably from 3% to 8% by weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the invention, in addition to the hydrophobic particles and the aqueous continuous liquid phase, may also include other ingredients that are conventionally present in depilatory formulations, such, as perfumes, oils, and pigments (such as titanium dioxide) and thickeners such as a clay.<br>
Suitable clays for thickening may include organophilic and layered clay minerals belonging to the geological classes of the smectites, the kaolins, the illites, the chlorites, the attapulgites and the mixed layer clays. Typical examples of specific clays belonging to these classes are: 1) smectites, e.g. montmorillonite, bentonite, pyrophyllite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, nontronite, talc, beidellite; 2) illites, e.g., bravaisite, muscovite, paragonite, phlogopite; 3) chlorites, e.g., corrensite, penninite, donbassite, sudoite; 4) attapulgites, e.g., sepiolite, and polygorskyte.<br><br>
The layered clay minerals may be either naturally occurring or synthetic. Preferred clay minerals for use in the present invention are natural or synthetic smectites and attapulgites, (particularly the hectorites, montmorillonites and bentonites,) and of these the hectorites are' especially preferred. Many of the above clays are available commercially, and typical examples of commercial hectorites are the Laponites ex Laporte Industries Ltd., England; Veegum Pro and Veegum -F ex R. T. -Vanderbi-lt, USA; and the Barasyms,- Macaloids and Propaloids ex Baroid Division, National Lead Company, USA. --If--a--e-lay is used for - thickening, it is preferably in an amount of from 0.1 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 1% by weight- of the composition.<br>
The inclusion of . a clay, preferably sodium lithium magnesium silicate, is particularly advantageous, since this provides lithium, sodium and magnesium ions for the buffer system and improves the efficiency of depilation. It is particularly preferred if the clay is a synthetic hectorite clay such as laponite™.<br>
Other optional water-soluble thickening agents which may be used include Carbomer™ (Acrylic acid polymer, preferably cross-linked) , acrylic polymer emulsions (e.-j. acrylate/steareth-20 methracylate copolymer) , polysaccharides, cellulose based •thickeners or natural thickeners such as gum arabic, alginates, carrageenan,<br><br>
locust  bean gum,  xanthan gum and polyvinyl  alcohol. Mixtures of thickeners may be used.<br>
A suitable method for preparing compositions according to the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
1)	Blending the fatty alcohol, emulsifier and oil gelling agent together into a molten phase at a temperature of 75, preferably 85°C or more,<br>
2)	emul.s.ifying the molten phase into an aqueous phase, the temperature of the aqueous phase prior<br>
	to emulsification being. 60_°C, preferably 70°C, more<br>
preferably 80 °C or more, whereby an emulsion comprising dispersed hydrophobic particles is formed,<br>
3)	cooling the emulsion to a temperature of 40°C or<br>
less,<br>
4)	dispersing the depilatory agent and any<br>
accelerator in the emulsion.<br>
The depilatory agent and any optional accelerator is preferably not added until after the emulsion has been cooled to prevent degradation of the depilatory agent {which may occur at substantially elevated temperatures) . Any optional ingredients may be added thereafter; however it is preferred for any clay to be added at an elevated temperature.<br><br>
In an alternative process according to the invention, the temperature of the aqueous phase may be below 40°C, preferably below 2 5°C prior to emulsification whereby the temperature of the resulting emulsion,  comprising dispersed particles, has a temperature of 40°C or less, whereby no further cooling step is required prior to dispersing the depilatory agent and any accelerator in the emulsion.   Alternatively, the depilatory agent and any optional accelerator may be present in the aqueous phase prior to the addition of the molten phase to the aqueous phase.<br>
The second aspect of the invention provides a method of hair removal from human skin including the steps of i) applying a composition according to the first aspect of the invention to the • skin where superfluous hair is present, ii) allowing the composition to remain in contact with the skin for a predetermined time, iii) removing the composition and degraded hair using a removal tool and iv) preferably washing the skin,<br>
For this second aspect of the invention, it is preferred if the composition is applied to the skin with an application tool, giving the advantage that the composition does not come into contact with the users hands. A block of material such as a sponge or a spatula may be employed, but a. preferred application tool is a glove, mitt or thumbless mitt, preferably furnished with an inner layer or membrane which is impermeable to the composition. Preferably, the membrane is also impermeable to water.<br><br>
The composition and degraded hair are preferably removed from the skin using a removal tool. A block of material such as a sponge or a spatula may be employed, but a preferred application tool is a glove, mitt or thumbless mitt, preferably furnished with an inner layer or membrane" which' "is"" "impermeable to * the composition. Preferably, the membrane is also impermeable to water.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if ' the application tool and -removal -tool are provided as a combined tool which has two distinct sides, i.e. front and back, which are distinguishable—by • the-.user., one side being adapted to apply the composition to the skin, and the other side being adapted to remove the composition from the skin. This has the advantage that only a single combined tool is needed for the application and removal while minimising or preventing contact of the users hands with the composition and preventing accidental transfer of the. composition to other parts of the body while ablutions are being performed. Preferably the front and back faces of the tool are of distinctly different texture and/or colour.<br>
Preferably the tool is a mitt or glove, more preferably a thumbless mitt, comprising an inner layer of a first material and an outer layer of a second material with an impc \~meable layer of flexible polymer membrane sandwiched between the inner and outer layers. Preferably the front and back faces of the tool are of distinctly different texture and/or colour. A thumbless mitt has the advantage that the user can apply the<br><br>
composition with the mitt on one hand, using the application side, then use the same mitt on the same hand for removal, using the removal side.<br>
In an alternative	embodiment, the tool may be in the<br>
"form" of "a "Block"	of mat'eriaT;  such as~ a rectangular<br>
"p'arallelipiped or	an ellipsoidal—shape suitable to be<br>
held in the hand.<br>
Preferably the block is formed of two portions which are joined together, wherein one portion is adapted for application of the composition of the invention, and .preferably ...is non-porous.,.. ..and the other portion is adapced for removal of the composition and degraded hair, and is preferably porous and more preferably spongy and is even more preferably furnished with a textured surface suitable for massaging or exfoliating the skin. Preferably the portion adapted for application of the composition is substantially impermeable to water and to the composition.<br>
According to the invention there is further provided the use of a composition according to the invention to degrade hair keratin.<br>
Throughout this specification, percentages of ingredients by weight are referenced to the weight of the total composition, unless otherwise specified. The following Examples illustrate the invention.<br><br>
Compositions were prepared according to the formulations given in the formulations table by emulsifying a melt at 85°C formed from the cetearyl alcohol, ceteareth 20, ppg-15 stearyl ether and polyethylene (when present) into water at 80°C. The resulting blend was cooled to 40°C prior to addition of the depilatory agent: other ingredients were blended while-cooling-from 80--to-40°C.<br>
Examples 3A and 3B are compositions according to the<br>
invention. Examples 1, 2A and 2B are comparative -examples.  Examples. 1,_ 2A, .2B,.__3A ..and 3B were formulated<br>
such that the weight of fatty<br>
-a-1-cohol/emulsif ier/polyethylene. 	is     substantially<br>
constant for each example.<br><br><br>
N.B. Formulas 1A and IB have the same compositions but 5 were made in different batches. Formulas 2A and 2B have the same compositions but made in different batches. Formulas 3A, 3B and 3C have the same compositions but were made in different batches.<br>
10 Performalene 4 00™ has a mean molecular weight of 450 unified mass units, and Performa V825™ has a mean molecular weight of 655.<br><br>
The compositions according to table 1 were stored at 25°C in airtight containers for 24 hours prior to rinse-ability testing according to the following method.<br>
Materials and methods<br>
"The rinse-ability testing waa carried out by applying a uniform layer of the cream being • tested onto a glass plate, and subsequently measuring the volume of cream remaining on the glass plate after it had been exposed to a continuous flow of water for a pre-determined time.<br>
The amount of cream remaining on the glass plate at the end of each trial is given as a % of cream remaining on the glass plate after the rinse-ability test is completed.<br>
Test 1<br>
Composition 3A was compared to composition 1. The results are given in table 2,<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The results demonstrate that:<br>
1) The presence of the polyethylene leads to a marked<br>
increase in rinsing time.for the compositions .<br>
2)' The polyethylene of molecular - weight . 4 00- is more<br>
effective than - that .-of—molecular weight 655,  however<br>
polyethylene  at  both molecular  weights  show  reduced<br>
rinse-ability.<br><br><br>

8.	Device as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein the focus means (32) comprise a variable gain unit (57) for matching, during scribing and in dependence of the radiation of the beam, detector signals for colored dots and uncolored dots, at which uncolored dots the radiation sensitive layer is unaffected.<br>
9.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the label control means (33) are arranged for controlling the focus means for, in adjacent traces of dots, controlling the phase and/or frequency of the focus excitation signal for reducing visible degradation of the label due to defocusing caused by the focus excitation signal.<br>
10.	Method of scribing a visible label on a medium (11) via a beam of radiation (24) for use in a scanning device,<br>
the medium having a label side provided with a radiation sensitive layer for creating the visible label,<br><br>
the device comprising a head (22) for providing the beam of radiation for<br>
generating a scribing spot on the radiation sensitive layer for scribing the visible label, focus means (32) for generating a focus control signal for focusing the<br>
scribing spot,<br>
the focus means being arranged for detecting a focus error by including a<br>
focus excitation signal in the focus control signal and detecting a deviation in the detector<br>
signal in dependence of the focus excitation signal, which method comprises the steps of controlling the scribing in dependence of label data, and controlling the focus means in dependence on the label data to detect the focus<br>
error during said scribing and without interrupting said scribing.<br>
