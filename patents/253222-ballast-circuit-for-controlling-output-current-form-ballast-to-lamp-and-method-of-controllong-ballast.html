				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Application Serial No. 10/706,677, filed<br>
November 12, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to thermal protection for lamp ballasts. Specifically, this<br>
invention relates to a ballast having active thermal management and protection circuitry that<br>
allows the ballast to safely operate when a ballast over-temperature condition has been detected,<br>
allowing the ballast to safely continue to provide power to the lamp.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Lamp ballasts are devices that convert standard line voltage and frequency to a<br>
voltage and frequency suitable for a specific lamp type. Usually, ballasts are one component of a<br>
lighting fixture that receives one or more fluorescent lamps. The lighting fixture may have more<br>
than one ballast.<br>
[0004]	Ballasts are generally designed to operate within a specified operating<br>
temperature. The maximum operating temperature of the ballast can be exceeded as the result of<br>
a number of factors, including improper matching of the ballast to the lamp(s), improper heat<br>
sinking, and inadequate ventilation of the lighting fixture. If an over-temperature condition is<br>
not remedied, then the ballast and/or lamp(s) may be damaged or destroyed.<br>
[0005]	Some prior art ballasts have circuitry that shuts down the ballast upon detecting<br>
an over-temperature condition. This is typically done by means of a thermal cut-out switch that<br>
senses the ballast temperature. When the switch detects an over-temperature condition, it shuts<br>
down the ballast by removing its supply voltage. If a normal ballast temperature is subsequently<br>
achieved, the switch may restore the supply voltage to the ballast. The result is lamp flickering<br>
and/or a prolonged loss of lighting. The flickering and loss of lighting can be annoying. In<br>
addition, the cause may not be apparent and might be mistaken for malfunctions in other<br>
electrical systems, such as the lighting control switches, circuit breakers, or even the wiring.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	A lamp ballast has temperature sensing circuitry and control circuitry responsive<br>
to the temperature sensor that limits the output current provided by the ballast when an over-<br>
temperature condition has been detected. The control circuitry actively adjusts the output current<br>
as long as the over-temperature condition is detected so as to attempt to restore an acceptable<br>
operating temperature while continuing to operate the ballast (i.e., without shutting down the<br>
ballast). The output current is maintained at a reduced level until the sensed temperature returns<br>
to the acceptable temperature.<br>
[0007]	Various methods for adjusting the output current are disclosed. In one<br>
embodiment, the output current is linearly adjusted during an over-temperature condition. In<br>
another embodiment, the output current is adjusted in a step function during an over-temperature<br>
condition. In yet other embodiments, both linear and step function adjustments to output current<br>
are employed in differing combinations. In principle, the linear function may be replaced with<br>
any continuous decreasing function including linear and non-linear functions. Gradual, linear<br>
adjustment of the output current tends to provide a relatively imperceptible change in lighting<br>
intensity to a casual observer, whereas a stepwise adjustment may be used to create an obvious<br>
change so as to alert persons that a problem has been encountered and/or corrected.<br>
[0008]	The invention has particular application to (but is not limited to) dimming ballasts<br>
of the type that are responsive to a dimming control to dim fluorescent lamps connected to the<br>
ballast. Typically, adjustment of the dimming control alters the output current delivered by the<br>
ballast. This is carried out by altering the duty cycle, frequency or pulse width of switching<br>
signals delivered to a one or more switching transistors in the output circuit of the ballast. These<br>
switching transistors may also be referred to as output switches. An output switch is a switch,<br>
such as a transistor, whose duty cycle and/or switching frequency is varied to control the output<br>
current of the ballast. A tank in the ballast's output circuit receives the output of the switches to<br>
provide a generally sinusoidal (AC) output voltage and current to the lamp(s). The duty cycle,<br>
frequency or pulse width is controlled by a control circuit that is responsive to the output of a<br>
phase to DC converter that receives a phase controlled AC dimming signal provided by the<br>
dimming control. The output of the phase to DC converter is a DC signal having a magnitude<br>
that varies in accordance with a duty cycle value of the dimming signal. Usually, a pair of<br>
voltage clamps (high and low end clamps) is disposed in the phase to DC converter for the<br>
purpose of establishing high end and low end intensity levels. The low end clamp sets the<br>
minimum output current level of the ballast, while the high end clamp sets its maximum output<br>
current level.<br><br>
[0009]	According to one embodiment of the invention, a ballast temperature sensor is<br>
coupled to a foldback protection circuit that dynamically adjusts the high end clamping voltage<br>
in accordance with the sensed ballast temperature when the sensed ballast temperature exceeds a<br>
threshold. The amount by which the high end clamping voltage is adjusted depends upon the<br>
difference between the sensed ballast temperature and the threshold. According to another<br>
embodiment, the high and low end clamps need not be employed to implement the invention.<br>
Instead, the foldback protection circuit may communicate with a multiplier, that in turn<br>
communicates with the control circuit. In this embodiment, the control circuit is responsive to<br>
the output of the multiplier to adjust the duty cycle, pulse width or frequency of the switching<br>
signal.<br>
[0010]	The invention may also be employed in connection with a non-dimming ballast in<br>
accordance with the foregoing. Particularly, a ballast temperature sensor and foldback protection<br>
are provided as above described, and the foldback protection circuit communicates with the<br>
control circuit to alter the duty cycle, pulse width or frequency of the one or more switching<br>
signals when the ballast temperature exceeds the threshold.<br>
[0011]	In each of the embodiments, a temperature cutoff switch may also be employed to<br>
remove the supply voltage to shut down the ballast completely (as in the prior art) if the ballast<br>
temperature exceeds a maximum temperature threshold.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0027]	Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals represent like elements there<br>
is shown in Figures 1 and 2 functional block diagrams of typical prior art non-dimming and<br>
dimming ballasts, respectively. Referring to Figure 1, a typical non-dimming ballast includes a<br>
front end AC to DC converter 102 that converts applied line voltage 100a, b, typically 120 volts<br>
AC, 60 Hz, to a higher voltage, typically 400 to 500 volts DC. Capacitor 104 stabilizes the high<br>
voltage output on 103a, b of AC to DC converter 102. The high voltage across capacitor 104 is<br>
presented to a back end DC to AC converter 106, which typically produces a 100 to 400 Volt AC<br>
output at 45 KHz to 80 KHz at terminals 107a, b to drive the load 108, typically one or more<br>
florescent lamps. Typically, the ballast includes a thermal cut-out switch 110. Upon detecting an<br>
over-temperature condition, the thermal cutout switch 110 removes the supply voltage at 100a to<br><br>
shut down the ballast. The supply voltage is restored if the switch detects that the ballast returns<br>
to a normal or acceptable temperature.<br>
[0028]	The above description is applicable to Figure 2, except that Figure 2 shows<br>
additional details of the back end DC to AC converter 106, and includes circuitry 218, 220 and<br>
222 that permits the ballast to respond to a dimming signal 217 from a dimming control 216. The<br>
dimming control 216 may be any phase controlled dimming device and may be wall mountable.<br>
An example of a commercially available dimming ballast of the type of Figure 2 is model<br>
number FDB-T554-120-2, available from Lutron Electronics, Co., Inc., Coopersburg, PA, the<br>
assignee of the present invention. As is known, the dimming signal is a phase controlled AC<br>
dimming signal, of the type shown in Figure 4a, such that the duty cycle of the dimming signal<br>
and hence the RMS voltage of the dimming signal varies with adjustment of the dimming<br>
actuator. Dimming signal 217 drives a phase to DC converter 218 that converts the phase<br>
Controlled dimming signal 217 to a DC voltage signal 219 having a magnitude that varies in<br>
accordance with a duty cycle value of the dimming signal, as graphically shown in Figure 4b. It<br>
will be seen that the signal 219 generally linearly tracks the dimming signal 217. However,<br>
clamping circuit 220 modifies this generally linear relationship as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0029]	The signal 219 stimulates ballast drive circuit 222 to generate at least one<br>
switching control signal 223a, b. Note that the switching control signals 223a, b shown in Figure<br>
2 are typical of those in the art that drive output switches in an inverter function (DC to AC) in<br>
the back-end converter 106. An output switch is a switch whose duty cycle and/or switching<br>
frequency is varied to control the output current of the ballast. The switching control signals<br>
control the opening and closing of output switches 210, 211 coupled to a tank circuit 212, 213.<br>
Although Figure 2 depicts a pair of switching control signals, 223a, b, an equivalent function that<br>
uses only one switching signal may be used. A current sense device 228 provides an output<br>
(load) current feedback signal 226 to the ballast drive circuit 222. The duty cycle, pulse width or<br>
frequency of the switching control signals is varied in accordance with the level of the signal 219<br>
(subject to clamping by the circuit 220), and the feedback signal 226, to determine the output<br>
voltage and current delivered by the ballast.<br>
[0030]	High and low end clamp circuit 220 in the phase to DC converter limits the output<br>
219 of the phase to DC converter. The effect of the high and low end clamp circuit 220 on the<br>
phase to DC converter is graphically shown in the Figure 4c. It will be seen that the high and<br>
low clamp circuit 220 clamps the upper and lower ends of the otherwise linear signal 219 at<br>
levels 400 and 401, respectively. Thus, the high and low end clamp circuitry 220 establishes<br>
minimum and maximum dimming levels.<br><br>
[0031]	A temperature cutoff switch 110 (Figure 1) is also usually employed. All that has<br>
been described thus far is prior art.<br>
[0032]	Figure 3 is a block diagram of a dimming ballast employing the present invention.<br>
In particular, the dimming ballast of Figure 2 is modified to include a ballast temperature sensing<br>
circuit 300 that provides a ballast temperature signal 305 to a foldback protection circuit 310. As<br>
described below, the foldback protection circuit 310 provides an appropriate adjustment signal<br>
315 to the high and low end clamp circuit 220' to adjust the high cutoff level 400. Functionally,<br>
clamp circuit 220' is similar to clamp circuit 220 of Figure 2, however, the clamp circuit 220' is<br>
further responsive to adjustment signal 315, which dynamically adjusts the high end clamp<br>
voltage (i.e. level 400).<br>
[0033]	The ballast temperature sensing circuit 300 may comprise one or more thermistors<br>
with a defined resistance to temperature coefficient characteristic, or another type of temperature<br>
sensing thermostat device or circuit. Foldback protection circuit 310 generates an adjustment<br>
signal 315 in response to comparison of temperature signal 305 to a threshold. The foldback<br>
protection circuit may provide either a linear output (using a linear response generator) or a step<br>
function output (using a step response generator), or a combination of both, if the comparison<br>
determines that an over-temperature condition exists. In principle, the exemplary linear function .<br>
shown in Figure 3 may be replaced with any continuous function including linear and non-linear<br>
functions. For the purpose of simplicity and clarity, the linear continuous function example will<br>
be used. But, it can be appreciated that other continuous functions may equivalently be used.<br>
Regardless of the exact function used, the high end clamp level 400 is reduced from its normal<br>
operating level when the foldback protection circuit 310 indicates that an over-temperature<br>
condition exists. Reducing the high end clamp level 400 adjusts the drive signal 219' to the<br>
ballast drive circuit 222 so as to alter the duty cycle, pulse width or frequency of the switching<br>
control signals 223a, b and hence reduce the output current provided by the ballast to load 108.<br>
Reducing output current should, under normal circumstances, reduce the ballast temperature.<br>
Any decrease in ballast temperature is reflected in signal 315, and the high end clamp level 400<br>
is increased and/or restored to normal, accordingly.<br>
[0034]	Figures 5a - 5d graphically illustrate various examples of adjusting the output<br>
current during an over-temperature condition. These examples are not exhaustive and other<br>
functions or combinations of functions may be employed.<br>
[0035]	In the example of Figure 5a, output current is adjusted linearly when the ballast<br>
temperature exceeds threshold Tl. If the ballast temperature exceeds T1, the foldback protection<br>
circuit 310 provides a limiting input to the high end clamp portion of the clamp circuit 220'so as<br><br>
to linearly reduce the high end clamp level 400, such that the output current may be reduced<br>
linearly from 100% to a preselected minimum. The temperature T1 may be preset by selecting<br>
the appropriate thresholds in the foldback protection circuit 310 as described in greater detail<br>
below. During the over-temperature condition, the output current can be dynamically adjusted<br>
in the linear region 510 until the ballast temperature stabilizes and is permitted to be restored to<br>
normal. Since fluorescent lamps are often operated in the saturation region of the lamp (where<br>
an incremental change in lamp current may not produce a corresponding change in light<br>
intensity), the linear adjustment of the output current may be such that the resulting change in<br>
intensity is relatively imperceptible to a casual observer. For example, a 40% reduction in output<br>
current (when the lamp is saturated) may produce only a 10% reduction in perceived intensity.<br>
[0036]	The embodiment of the invention of Figure 3 limits the output current of the load<br>
to the linear region 510 even if the output current is less than the maximum (100%) value. For<br>
example, referring to Figure 5a, the dimming control signal 217 may be set to operate the lamp<br>
load 108 at, for example, 80% of the maximum load current. If the temperature rises to above a<br>
temperature value Tl, a linear limiting response is not activated until the temperature reaches a<br>
value of Tl*. At that value, linear current limiting may occur which will limit the output current<br>
to the linear region 510. This allows the maximum (100%) linear limiting profile to be utilized<br>
even if the original setting of the lamp was less than 100% load current. As the current limiting<br>
action of the invention allows the temperature to fall, the lamp load current will once again<br>
return to the originally set 80% level as long as the dimmer control signal 217 is unchanged.<br>
[0037] In the example of Figure 5b, output current may be reduced in a step function<br>
when the ballast temperature exceeds threshold T2. If the ballast temperature exceeds T2, then<br>
the foldback protection circuit 310 provides a limiting input to the high end portion of the clamp<br>
220' so as to step down the high end clamp level 400; this results in an immediate step down in<br>
supplied output current from 100% to level L1. Once the ballast temperature returns to an<br>
acceptable operating temperature T3, the foldback protection circuit 310 allows the output<br>
current to immediately return to 100%, again as a step function. Notice that recovery temperature<br>
T3 is lower than T2. Thus, the foldback protection circuit 310 exhibits hysteresis. The use of<br>
hysteresis helps to prevent oscillation about T2 when the ballast is recovering from a higher<br>
temperature. The abrupt changes in output current may result in obvious changes in light<br>
intensity so as to alert persons that a problem has been encountered and/or corrected.<br>
[0038]	In the example of Figure 5c, both linear and step function adjustments in output<br>
current are employed. For ballast temperatures between T4 and T5, there is linear adjustment of<br>
the output current between 100% and level L2. However, if the ballast temperature exceeds T5,<br><br>
then there is an immediate step down in supplied output current from level L2 to level L3. If the<br>
ballast temperature returns to an acceptable operating temperature T6, the foldback protection<br>
circuit 310 allows the output current to return to level L4, again as a step function, and the output<br>
current is again dynamically adjusted in a linear manner. Notice that recovery temperature T6 is<br>
lower than T5. Thus, the foldback protection circuit 310 exhibits hysteresis, again preventing<br>
oscillation about T5, The linear adjustment of the output current between 100% and L2 may be<br>
such that the resulting change in lamp intensity is relatively imperceptible to a casual observer,<br>
whereas the abrupt changes in output current between L2 and L3 may be such that they result in<br>
obvious changes in light intensity so as to alert persons that a problem has been encountered<br>
and/or corrected.<br>
[0039]	In the example of Figure 5d, a series of step functions is employed to adjust the<br>
output current between temperatures T7 and T8. Particularly, there is a step-wise decrease in<br>
output current from 100% to level L5 at T7 and another step-wise decrease in output current<br>
from level L5 to level L6 at T8. Upon a temperature decrease and recovery, there is a step-wise<br>
increase in output current from level L6 to level L5 at T11, and another step-wise increase in<br>
output current from level L5 to .100% at T12 (each step function thus employing hysteresis to<br>
prevent oscillation about T7 and T8). Between ballast temperatures of T9 and T10, however,<br>
linear adjustment of the output current, between levels L6 and L7, is employed. Once again, step<br>
and linear response generators (described below) in the foldback protection circuitry 310 of<br>
Figure 3 allow the setting of thresholds for the various temperature settings. One or more of the<br>
step-wise adjustments in output current may result in obvious changes in light intensity, whereas<br>
the linear adjustment may be relatively imperceptible.<br>
[0040]	In each of the examples, a thermal cutout switch may be employed, as illustrated<br>
at 110 in Figure 1, to remove the supply voltage and shut down the ballast if a substantial over-<br>
temperature condition is detected.<br>
[0041]	Figure 6 illustrates one circuit level implementation of selected portions of the<br>
Figure 3 embodiment. The foldback protection circuit 310 includes a linear response generator<br>
610 and a step response generator 620. The adjustment signal 315 drives the output stage 660 of<br>
the phase to DC converter 218' via the high end clamp 630 of the clamp circuit 220'. A low end<br>
clamp 640 is also shown.<br>
[0042]	Temperature sensing circuit 300 may be an integrated circuit device that exhibits<br>
an increasing voltage output with increasing temperature. The temperature sensing circuit 300<br>
feeds the linear response generator 610 and the step response generator 620. The step response<br><br>
generator 620 is in parallel with the linear response generator 610 and both act in a temperature<br>
dependent manner to produce the adjustment signal 315.<br>
[0043]	The temperature threshold of the linear response generator 610 is set by voltage<br>
divider R3, R4, and the temperature threshold of the step response generator 620 is set by voltage<br>
divider R1, R2. The hysteresis characteristic of the step response generator 620 is achieved by<br>
means of feedback, as is well known in the art.<br>
[0044]	The threshold of low end clamp 640 is set via a voltage divider labeled simply<br>
VDIV1. The phase controlled dimming signal 217 is provided to one input of a comparator 650.<br>
The other input of comparator 650 receives a voltage from a voltage divider labeled VDIV2. The<br>
output stage 660 of the phase to DC converter 218' provides the control signal 219'.<br>
[0045]	Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the temperature thresholds of the<br>
linear and step response generators 610, 620 may be set such that the foldback protection circuit<br>
310 exhibits either a linear function followed by a step function (See Figure 5c), or the reverse.<br>
Sequential step functions may be achieved by utilizing two step response generators 620 (See<br>
steps L5 and L6 of Figure 5d). Likewise, sequential linear responses may be achieved by<br>
replacing the step response generator 620 with another linear response generator 610. If only a<br>
linear function (Figure 5a) or only a step function (Figure 5b) is desired, only the appropriate<br>
response generator is employed. The foldback protection circuit 310 may be designed to produce<br>
more than two types of functions, e.g., with the addition of another parallel stage. For example<br>
the function of Figure 5d may be obtained with the introduction of another step response<br>
generator 62.0 to the foldback protection circuit, and by setting the proper temperature thresholds.<br>
[0046]	Figure 7 is a block diagram of a dimming ballast according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Again, the dimming ballast of Figure 2 is modified to include a ballast temperature sensing circuit 300 that provides a ballast temperature signal 305 to a<br>
foldback protection circuit 310. The foldback protection circuit 310' produces, as before, an<br>
adjustment signal 315' to modify the response of the DC to AC back end 106 in an over-<br>
temperature condition. Nominally, the phase controlled dimming signal 217 from the dimming<br>
control 216, and the output of the high and low end clamps 220, act to produce the control signal<br>
219 that is used, for example, in the dimming ballast of Figure 2. However, in the configuration<br>
of Figure 7, the control signal 219 and the adjustment signal 315' are combined via multiplier<br>
700. The resulting product signal 701 is used to drive the ballast drive circuit 222' in conjunction<br>
with feedback signal 226. It should be noted that ballast drive circuit 222' performs the same<br>
function as the ballast drive circuit 222 of Figure 3 except that ballast drive circuit 222' may<br>
have a differently scaled input as described hereinbelow.<br><br>
[0047]	As before, in normal operation, dimming control 216 acts to deliver a phase<br>
controlled dimming signal 217 to the phase to DC converter 218. The phase to DC converter 218<br>
provides an input 219 to the multiplier 700. The other multiplier input is the adjustment signal<br>
315'.<br>
[0048]	Under normal temperature conditions, the multiplier 700 is influenced only by the<br>
signal 219 because the adjustment signal 315' is scaled to represent a multiplier of 1.0.<br>
Functionally, adjustment signal 315' is similar to 315 of Figure 3 except for the effect of scaling.<br>
Under over-temperature conditions, the foldback protection circuit 310' scales the adjustment<br>
signal 315' to represent a multiplier of less than 1.0. The product of the multiplication of the<br>
signal 219 and the adjustment signal 315' will therefore be less than 1.0 and will thus scale back<br>
the drive signal 701, thus decreasing the output current to load 108.<br>
[0049]	Figure 8 illustrates the response of output current versus temperature for the<br>
embodiment of Figure 7. As in the response shown in Figure 5a, at 100% of load current, the<br>
current limiting function may be linearly decreasing beyond a temperature Tl. However, in<br>
contrast to Figure 5a, the response of the embodiment of Figure 7 at lower initial current settings<br>
is more immediate. In the multiplier embodiment of Figure 7, current limiting begins once the<br>
threshold temperature of Tl is reached. For example, the operating current of the lamp 108 may<br>
be set to be at a level lower than maximum, say at 80%, via dimmer control signal 217 which<br>
results in an input signal 219 to multiplier 700. Assuming that the temperature rises to a level of<br>
Tl, the multiplier input signal 315' would immediately begin to decrease to a level below 1.0<br>
thus producing a reduced output for the drive signal 701. Therefore, the 100% current limiting<br>
response profile 810 is different from the 80% current limiting response profile 820 beyond<br>
. threshold temperature T1.	<br>
 [0050]	It can be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the multiplier 700 may be<br>
implemented as either an analog or a digital multiplier. Accordingly, the drive signals for the<br>
multiplier input would be correspondingly analog or digital in nature to accommodate the type of<br>
multiplier 700 utilized.<br>
[0051]	Figure 9 illustrates application of the invention to a non-dimming ballast, e.g., of<br>
the type of Figure 2, which does not employ high end and low end clamp circuitry or a phase to<br>
DC converter. As before, there is provided a ballast temperature sensing circuit 300 that<br>
provides a ballast temperature signal 305 to a foldback protection circuit 310". The foldback<br>
protection circuit 310' provides an adjustment signal 315" to ballast drive circuit 222. Instead of<br>
adjusting the level of a high end clamp, the adjustment signal 315" is provided directly to ballast<br><br>
drive circuit 222. Otherwise the foregoing description of the function and operation of Figure 3,<br>
and the examples of Figures 5a - 5d, are applicable.<br>
[0052]	The circuitry described herein for implementing the invention is preferably<br>
packaged with, or encapsulated within, the ballast itself, although such circuitry could be<br>
separately packaged from, or remote from, the ballast.<br>
[0053]	It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations may be made in the apparatus and method of the present invention without departing<br>
from the spirit or scope of the invention. For example, although a linearly decreasing function is<br>
disclosed as one possible embodiment for implementation of current limiting, other continuously decreasing functions, even non-linear decreasing functions, may be used as a current limiting mechanism without departing from the spirit of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention encompass modifications and variations of this invention provided those modifications<br>
and variations come within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof.<br><br>
