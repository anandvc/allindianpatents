				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>I. Application area<br>
The invention relates to a distribution cabinet which<br>
is usually set up outdoors and accommodates the<br>
technical, for example electrical or optical,<br>
distribution installations for, for example, weak-<br>
current systems, for example telephone systems, with<br>
associated power-supply devices and cable-terminal/-<br>
connection devices for a certain area.<br>
II. Technical background<br>
Nowadays - in addition to having sufficient structural<br>
stability and resistance to vandalism, etc. - such<br>
distribution cabinets have to satisfy further<br>
requirements, for example excessive electromagnetic<br>
radiation must not be emitted to the surroundings, and,<br>
for use in warmer countries in particular, the<br>
temperatures in the interior of the distribution<br>
cabinet must not rise to too high a level, despite the<br>
heat-emitting electrical subassemblies accommodated<br>
there, nor must they drop to too low a level.<br>
Such distribution cabinets are, in principle, produced<br>
either from metal or from plastic, plastic combining<br>
the advantage of less expensive production with the<br>
advantage of an electrically non-conductive material,<br>
with the result that, even in the case of unplanned<br>
contact being established between the housing of the<br>
distribution cabinet and an electrical component, there<br>
is never the risk of a person who touches the housing<br>
from the outside receiving an electric shock.<br>
As far as the sufficient cooling capability of such<br>
distribution cabinets is concerned, it is already known<br><br>
for cooling to be effected by air circulation. For<br>
this purpose, the body is of a double-walled<br>
configuration, the ambient air being able to circulate<br>
in the intermediate space between the walls, that is to<br>
say enter at the bottom and leave at the top, whereby<br>
on the one hand heating-up of the interior by sunlight<br>
is prevented and on the other hand heat dissipation is<br>
effected at the inner wall, which is heated up by the<br>
electrical subassemblies in the main space.<br>
In addition, modern distribution cabinets are made EMC-<br>
proof, with the consequent result that electromagnetic<br>
emission to the outside can only take place within the<br>
prescribed limit values.<br>
Some of such distribution cabinets are on private<br>
property, but they are often also on public property,<br>
so that the respective local authorities have to grant<br>
approval for such a distribution cabinet to be<br>
installed. As long as the telecommunication companies<br>
were also state-owned, this rarely presented any<br>
problems; with increasing privatization, the<br>
authorities are refusing installation or demand a fee<br>
for installation, quite apart from the fact that an<br>
approval procedure has to be undergone and takes<br>
considerable time.<br>
This problem arises in the case of all distribution<br>
cabinets that are to be newly installed, that is to say<br>
in particular in development areas, or if there is no<br>
longer any space available for technical components, in<br>
particular electrical components, in an existing<br>
distribution cabinet and a further distribution cabinet<br>
should be additionally set up alongside it.<br>
A further, technical problem exists when an existing<br>
distribution cabinet is replaced for technical reasons,<br>
that is to say for example if the body of an already<br>
existing distribution cabinet has to be exchanged to<br><br>
improve the EMC-proof shielding or the cooling<br>
capability.<br>
At the same time, it must be remembered that a<br>
distribution cabinet generally rests on a base buried<br>
deep in the ground, usually made of concrete, latterly<br>
also of plastic, into which the buried cables leading<br>
to the distribution cabinet and away from it again are<br>
led from below, and to which both the usually present<br>
installation frame on which the technical components,<br>
in particular electrical components, are fastened, is<br>
screwed in the same way as the surrounding body. The<br>
body is - in particular in the case of the double-shell<br>
type of construction mentioned with regard to the inner<br>
body - either produced from fixedly interconnected<br>
plates, or from a body frame closed by means of<br>
paneling. The outer body is fitted on such an inner<br>
body at a distance from it by means of paneling.<br>
III. Summary of the invention<br>
a)	Technical object<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method for exchanging, in particular<br>
increasing the size of, the body of a distribution<br>
cabinet and also a construction kit for this, the<br>
exchange of which body is unproblematical and with<br>
which method the distribution cabinet remains at the<br>
original location and consequently no new installation<br>
approval or construction approval is necessary.<br>
b)	Solution achieving the object<br>
This object is achieved by the features of claims 1 and<br>
14. Advantageous embodiments emerge from the<br>
subclaims.<br><br>
By slipping a new base and also a new body - after<br>
removal of the old body - over the old components<br>
enclosed by the switch cabinet, that is to say leaving<br>
the old base and the transmission equipment mounted on<br>
it, that is to say the technical, in particular<br>
electrical functional parts, in their place, no<br>
disconnection from the power supply system, that is<br>
disconnection of the technical, in particular<br>
electrical, functional elements, inside the switch<br>
cabinet is necessary.<br>
Since the switch cabinet remains in its existing<br>
position and only the outside dimensions of the new<br>
body increase to a greater or lesser extent, generally<br>
no new official installation approval is necessary<br>
either.<br>
By removing the ground from around the base,	but<br>
preferably not quite as far as the lower edge of	the<br>
old base, not only does the old base remain in	its<br>
position, but usually it is also not entirely deprived<br>
of its stability during the conversion work, with	the<br>
result that there is no reason to fear that	the<br>
stripped old switch cabinet may tip over during	the<br>
work.<br>
However, if need be it is possible at any time for the<br>
stripped old switch cabinet to be destabilized<br>
deliberately - by removing the ground down to the lower<br>
edge of the old base - in order to set it straight<br>
again - for example if it is tilted - or else move it<br>
slightly from where it is located. The latter is often<br>
necessary for example whenever the old switch cabinet<br>
was positioned with its rear side too close to an<br>
existing building, garden wall or the like, and must be<br>
shifted a few centimeters away from there to slip the<br>
new switch cabinet over it.<br><br>
Slipping over the new base box, which is hollow in plan<br>
view and preferably in the form of a closed box<br>
profile, and in particular the base feet projecting<br>
preferably laterally outward from the base box, have<br>
the effect of increasing the size of the standing area<br>
of the lateter in such a way that secure support in the<br>
ground is ensured - despite the smaller installation<br>
depth.<br>
The base is in this case preferably assembled before it<br>
is slipped over, from the usually one-piece, but<br>
possibly also multi-part, base box and the base feet,<br>
the base feet preferably in turn comprising base-foot<br>
side parts and a base-foot plate which is continuous on<br>
each side, and consequently for two side parts.<br>
For transport, the base feet are often already fastened<br>
to the base box, but turned by 180° with respect to a<br>
vertical axis, with the result that the base-foot plate<br>
does not project outward beyond the base box. In this<br>
transporting position, the base can also be used in the<br>
case where a distribution cabinet is newly constructed.<br>
This on the one hand reduces the transporting volume of<br>
the base and on the other hand allows the parts to be<br>
produced from the most favorable material in each case,<br>
for example the base-foot plates from galvanized sheet-<br>
steel meshes or plastic meshes, while the base-foot<br>
side parts may be bent sheet-steel parts. The base box<br>
itself consists for example of concrete, plastic, metal<br>
or a mixture of these materials.<br>
The production of the base-foot plates as mesh parts<br>
and in particular from plastic has proven to be<br>
advantageous for several reasons: on the one hand, the<br>
mesh form makes it possible for the base to be vibrated<br>
and consequently leveled exactly horizontally in a<br>
simple way. If this base-foot plate consists of<br>
plastic, apertures and cutouts can be made in a simple<br><br>
way in the plate on site, for example to accommodate<br>
cables leading away from the distribution cabinet.<br>
Once the base has been aligned, in particular<br>
horizontally, but also approximately in its lateral<br>
distance from the old base, placement of the new body<br>
on the new base takes place in that the new body is<br>
raised by a crane, in particular the loading crane of<br>
the delivery truck, by means of lifting lugs screwed<br>
into the body, and slipped from above over the<br>
electrical components enclosed by the old switch<br>
cabinet - which has been freed of its old housing - and<br>
also over its base, since the new base generally rises<br>
up less far than the old base, with the result that the<br>
new body also extends vertically over part of the old<br>
base. Generally, further work will necessitate removal<br>
of the outer cladding of the new body, that is to say<br>
of the outer side walls, rear wall and doors, which,<br>
depending on the size and weight of the new body, can<br>
take place before or after it is slipped over.<br>
By contrast, the removal of the roof module, usually<br>
comprising an upper cover and an upper intermediate<br>
part located under said cover, which rests on the<br>
intrinsically stable main part of the new body, is<br>
generally essential, since, for the slipping-over<br>
operation, the lifting lugs for attaching the crane are<br>
screwed into this main part of the new body from above,<br>
or fastened in some other way.<br>
For this purpose, when the new body is delivered, the<br>
roof module is only loosely in place and not already<br>
fixedly connected to the rest of the body.<br>
After connecting, in particular screwing, the new body<br>
to the new base, in particular the lower edge of the<br>
new body to the upper edge of the new base, the new<br>
body - and consequently also the new base already<br>
connected to it - is brought to the desired distance<br><br>
from the old base in the horizontal direction,<br>
preferably by means of horizontally lying adjusting<br>
screws in the new body.<br>
For this purpose, the body, and in particular the body<br>
frame of the new body, has horizontally running cross<br>
struts just below the height of the upper edge of the<br>
body, to which or through which, by means of horizontal<br>
threaded bores, the adjusting screws can be screwed<br>
from outside and support themselves on the outer<br>
surface of the old base.<br>
Preferably, the old installation frame, on which the<br>
transmission equipment is mounted, is also detached<br>
from the old base, in particular by unscrewing or<br>
extracting the connecting screws, and instead fixed, in<br>
particular screwed, with respect to the new body.<br>
This takes place for example by means of the known<br>
perforated strips of metal or plastic, which on the one<br>
hand are screwed to the old installation frame, and on<br>
the other hand to the new body on the inner side, in<br>
particular to the body frame of the latter. For this<br>
purpose, sliding blocks in undercut grooves, which run<br>
along the edge profiles of the body frame, can be<br>
screwed in particular to such a body frame.<br>
Such fixing preferably takes place in the upper region<br>
of the old installation frame and, if appropriate, in<br>
its lower region. The use of the perforated strips<br>
allows different forms and positions of the old<br>
installation frames to be fastened to the new body.<br>
In addition, the EMC-proof shielding is achieved, in<br>
that the gap between the old base and the new body,<br>
which is peripheral when considered in plan view, is<br>
closed by an EMC seal - acting on the upper side of the<br>
old base.<br><br>
If the new body surrounds the old base only at a small<br>
distance, this takes place by adhesively attaching a<br>
strip of metal foil, for example a bitumen strip<br>
covered with aluminum foil, which rests with its one<br>
edge on the upper side of the old base and with the<br>
other edge on the cross struts extending at this height<br>
of the body frame of the new frame.<br>
If the new body serves for increasing the size of the<br>
interior space for new technical or electrical<br>
components, the then larger open surface area next to<br>
the old base is closed by means of a corresponding<br>
plate consisting of metal or covered with metal.<br>
In the additional interior space there is already -<br>
preferably already connected to the new body and in<br>
particular the body frame of the latter - a new<br>
installation frame for receiving the new electrical<br>
components.<br>
Finally, the new body, previously stripped of its<br>
cladding for better accessibility, is provided with<br>
panels again, that is to say the side walls are<br>
suspended from the top on the outside, and so is the<br>
rear wall, and the folding doors are fitted by pushing<br>
in from the top the hinge rod which extends over the<br>
entire height of the door and is passed through both by<br>
hinge lobes of the side part and by hinge lobes of the<br>
door.<br>
In this respect, care must be taken in particular not<br>
to damage the peripheral, combined splash-water and EMC<br>
seal, arranged in the doors and/or in the housing<br>
frame, which preferably consists of a customary soft<br>
plastic or rubber material, preferably of a hollow<br>
cross section, as the splash-water seal, and on the<br>
outer surface of which a metallized foil, or a foil<br>
that contains a metal gauze and is preferably self-<br>
adhesive, is applied as the EMC seal.<br><br>
Finally, the roof module is placed on, positively-<br>
engaging with its lower edge over the upper edge of the<br>
side walls and rear wall. The roof module in this case<br>
reaches down with securing continuations, which have a<br>
transverse bore, between the housing frame and the<br>
outer side wall. The roof module is secured against<br>
lifting off when the doors are fully opened, in that a<br>
securing bar is respectively pushed in horizontally<br>
from the front in the intermediate space between the<br>
housing frame and the side wall of the housing in such<br>
a way that it positively engages through both the bores<br>
of the securing continuations of the roof module and<br>
corresponding bores of analogous securing continuations<br>
projecting outward from the housing frame. After<br>
closing and barring the doors, this securing bar is no<br>
longer accessible from the outside, consequently cannot<br>
be removed, in order that the roof module is not taken<br>
off, and as a consequence the side walls and the rear<br>
wall are also not detached upward, and - as long as the<br>
lock is not destroyed - the front doors are not opened<br>
either.<br>

Figure 13 shows the base on its own.<br>
Before the procedure involved in slipping over the new<br>
distribution cabinet is explained on the basis of<br>
Figures 1 to 6, its individual parts, namely the new<br>
base 2 and the new body 3, are described individually<br>
on the' basis of Figures 7 to 13, and the different<br>
states of construction of the new body 3 are thereby<br>
explained on the basis of Figures 7 to 12.<br>
Figure 13 shows the new base 2, which is screwed<br>
together from a number of individual parts:<br>
On the one hand, the base box 2a, which is hollow, that<br>
is to say open right through when viewed in plan view,<br>
and generally consists of plastic, concrete, a mixture<br>
of the two or some other non-rusting material.<br>
Fastened under its outer side regions in the transverse<br>
direction 20, of the greater transverse extent of the<br>
base box 2a, are base feet 2b, with which the base box<br>
2a is set down on the underlying ground, which is<br>
removed for this purpose down to the desired level.<br>
The base feet 2b comprise base-foot plates 2d,<br>
preferably made of an intrinsically stable mesh, in<br>
particular a mesh of galvanized sheet steel with<br>
vertical ridges or a plastic mesh. These plates have a<br>
width preferably corresponding exactly to the<br>
horizontal depth, that is width, of the base box 2a and<br>
project laterally beyond the base box 2a in the<br>
transverse direction 20. When viewed in plan view, the<br><br>
plates 2d reach only under the side walls of the base<br>
box 2a, in a way corresponding to the thickness of said<br>
walls, with the result that the free space in the base<br>
box, when viewed in plan view, is not made any smaller<br>
by this.<br>
The plates 2d are fastened in this position with the<br>
aid of in each case two approximately triangular side<br>
parts 2c, which are screwed by one of their two right-<br>
angled outer edges to the plate 2d, in particular to<br>
the upper side of the latter, and are connected by the<br>
tapering upper region to the base box 2a and in this<br>
way position the plates 2d underneath the base box 2a<br>
and at a distance from it.<br>
The plates 2d serve for increasing the size of the<br>
standing area with respect to the base area of the<br>
peripheral parts, only narrow in plan view, of the one-<br>
piece or vertically or horizontally divided, multi-<br>
piece base box and can theoretically also project<br>
outward at the front and rear sides instead of at the<br>
outer narrow sides in the transverse" direction, or on<br>
all four sides. However, the result of a standing area<br>
of optimum size with only relatively little necessary<br>
excavation of the earth around the old base is obtained<br>
when the plates are fastened such that they project in<br>
the transverse direction beyond the sides of the base<br>
box 2a.<br>
Figures 7 to 12 show the increasingly completed<br>
construction phases of the new body 3 . The inner body<br>
has a cubic form and is intrinsically stable on account<br>
of a body frame 16 which is made up of edge profiles<br>
17, which are interconnected, in particular screwed, at<br>
their ends, in particular in the corners of the body<br>
frame 16, by means of corresponding corner connectors.<br>
In addition to the edge profiles 17, cross struts 34<br>
run horizontally along the edges of the cuboidal inner<br><br>
body 21 around the periphery between the vertical<br>
struts in the lower third of the body frame 16, and<br>
adjusting screws 13 are likewise arranged horizontally,<br>
directed from the outside inward against said cross<br>
struts.<br>
The adjusting screws 13 are in this case arranged in<br>
pairs, spaced apart from one another, respectively on<br>
the front and rear cross struts 34 running in the<br>
transverse direction, preferably also one each in the<br>
middle of the short cross struts running transversely<br>
in relation to the transverse direction 20.<br>
The body frame 16 is closed at the sides, at the rear<br>
side and at the upper side by preferably EMC-proof<br>
plates, which preferably lie in the range of the<br>
thickness of the edge profiles 17, so that only the<br>
front side, in particular in this case only the region<br>
lying above the cross struts 34, is open, as well as<br>
the base area between the edge profiles 17 running<br>
around the periphery at the bottom.<br>
Shown lying on the upper paneling are two screw-in<br>
lifting lugs 12, which if need be, that is for lifting<br>
this inner body 21, can be screwed into upwardly<br>
directed internal threads 22 that are open at the top<br>
of two diagonally opposite upper corner connectors of<br>
the body frame 16.<br>
Figures 8 show by contrast a state in which the inner<br>
body 21 as described is already fitted with side walls<br>
8, which are placed from the outside against the side<br>
faces of the inner body 21 and by lowering are<br>
positively connected to the latter, or fastened in some<br>
other way.<br>
Figure 9 shows a state in which, by contrast with the<br>
fittings according to Figure 8, a front flap 23 and a<br>
rear flap 24 - which like the side walls 8 and the rest<br><br>
of the cladding preferably consist of plastic - cover<br>
the front and rear lower regions of the inner body 21,<br>
in that they are likewise placed from the outside<br>
against the latter, preferably with positive<br>
engagement, or fastened in some other way and, as a<br>
result, close at the front and rear the region from the<br>
peripheral cross struts in the lower third to the lower<br>
end of the body frame 16, whereas the side walls 8 of<br>
course preferably extend over the entire height of the<br>
body frame 21.<br>
Figures 10 show a state in which the inner body 21 is<br>
additionally fitted with a rear wall 11 and front doors<br>
4a, b. The doors 4a, b are in this case hung in<br>
corresponding hinges as a pivot axis on the<br>
longitudinal outer edges of the front side, while the<br>
rear wall 11 is in turn fastened from the outside by<br>
hanging from above or in some other way.<br>
As the plan views 10d and 9d show in particular, the<br>
rear wall 11 and side walls 8 are positioned such that<br>
they are offset by a distance outward with respect to<br>
the inner body 21-open at the top and bottom -, so<br>
that air can flow upward in between as a result of the<br>
chimney effect.<br>
For the same reason, the doors 4a, b are formed in a<br>
double-walled manner with through-openings from the<br>
bottom to the top, the inner wall of the doors 4a, b in<br>
turn preferably being formed in an EMC-proof manner.<br>
Figures 11 show the state of the body 3 during<br>
completion by placing on the roof module 50, which<br>
comprises an upper intermediate part 7 and a cover 5,<br>
and preferably downwardly protruding continuations 2 5<br>
serve for pushing into the remaining body 3, in<br>
particular between the inner body 21 and the outer<br>
cladding of the latter, and screwing to the inner body<br>
21, in particular its body frame 16.<br><br>
Since the roof module 50, when viewed in plan view,<br>
protrudes beyond the inner body 21 and also covers the<br>
rear wall 11, side walls 8 and the doors 4a, b in the<br>
closed state, the fixed roof module 50 - as shown in<br>
the finals state of Figure 12 - prevents these parts<br>
from being raised upward and consequently prevents<br>
their removal from the inner body 21.<br>
Figures 1 show the pushing of the base 2, represented<br>
in Figures 13, over the old installation frame 6,<br>
loaded with technical or electrical functional parts,<br>
and the old base 2', which supports said frame and to<br>
which it is connected by means of fastening screws 18.<br>
The technical or electrical functional elements usually<br>
screwed and wired to the old installation frame 6 are<br>
not shown for reasons of overall clarity, but instead<br>
just the cable inlets 27 in the base plate 36 of the<br>
installation frame 6 are shown. However, when viewed<br>
in plan view, the electrical functional parts that are<br>
not shown do not protrude laterally beyond the base<br>
area of the old base 2', since, before the removal of<br>
the old body (not shown here) , which rested on the<br>
outer periphery of the old base 2', they were of course<br>
enclosed by said old body.<br>
Figures 2 show the final position of the new base 2,<br>
set down on the underlying ground, after it has been<br>
slipped over. As Figure 2b shows in particular, the<br>
new base 2 is much less high than the old base 2'.<br>
Since the ground level, that is to say the normal level<br>
of the ground surface, can be seen on the old base 2',<br>
the ground is removed around the old base 2', in<br>
particular in the transverse direction to the sides of<br>
the old base 2 ' , to such a depth that the new base 2<br>
can be placed in the removed region with its standing<br>
plates 2d on the new standing level 29 created in this<br>
way, which is chosen such that the upper edge of the<br><br>
new base 2 is at the height of the previous ground<br>
level 40.<br>
Depending on the depth of submergence of the old base<br>
2', this new standing level may lie, as shown in Figure<br>
2, just beneath the standing level of the old base 2'<br>
or else above it, the new standing level 29 preferably-<br>
being chosen such that it is above the old standing<br>
level, in order not to have to dig around the old base<br>
2' until it is completely free, which reduces the<br>
stability of the old base 2 ' , and consequently of the<br>
old switch cabinet, during the conversion work.<br>
At the same time there is the possibility of varying<br>
the height of the new base 2 by means of base side<br>
parts 2c of different heights.<br>
The plan view of Figure 2d also shows that the width of<br>
the new base, when viewed in plan view, that is to say<br>
transversely in relation to its transverse extent 20,<br>
is only of such a size that the inner, free space of<br>
the new base 2 that can be slipped over, that is to say<br>
in particular its base box 2a, is just slightly greater<br>
than the outer width of the old base 2'.<br>
In the transverse direction 20, the new base 2 may<br>
likewise just fit over the old base 2' or - as shown in<br>
Figure 2 - be much larger, in order to create space for<br>
the new installation frame next to the old installation<br>
frame 6 at a later time. For this reason, the new base<br>
2 is then slipped over the old base 2' in such a way<br>
that the latter bears with one of its sides closely<br>
against the lateral (right or left) inner periphery of<br>
the new base 2, in particular its base box 2a, and the<br>
additional interior space is consequently available<br>
only on one side of the old installation frame 6, that<br>
is in one piece.<br><br>
Once the new base 2 has been set down and aligned<br>
horizontally at the correct height in this way, the<br>
body 3, in particular only its inner body 21<br>
preferably hanging from a crane hook - is slipped from<br>
above over the old installation frame 6, so that the<br>
latter is completely surrounded by the new inner body<br>
21. The body 3, in particular its inner body 21, is<br>
thereby lowered until it rests on the upper side of the<br>
new base 2, and subsequently screwed to the latter by<br>
means of fastening screws 18.<br>
Preferably - when viewed in plan view - the inner body<br>
21 does not in this case protrude laterally beyond the<br>
outer periphery of the base box 2a, as can be seen from<br>
Figure 4, after fastening by means of the fastening<br>
screws 18 between the inner body 21 and the new base 2.<br>
Figure 5 shows the state of the new body 3 analogous to<br>
Figure 10, that is to say with fitted outer cladding on<br>
the inner body 21 in the form of the side walls 8, the<br>
rear wall 11 and the two outer-attached front doors 4a,<br>
b. As the front view of Figure 5b and the plan view of<br>
Figure 5d show in particular, the outer periphery of<br>
the new body 3 fitted out in this way is greater than<br>
the outer periphery of the new base box 2a, so that the<br>
side walls 8 extend over the entire height of the inner<br>
body 21 and of the base box 2a, and also the front flap<br>
23' and the rear flap 24' that are used cover in terms<br>
of height not only the lower region of the inner body<br>
21, that is to say from the cross struts 34 downward,<br>
but also the part lying thereunder of the new base box<br>
2a.<br>
Figure 5a also shows the new installation frame 6a,<br>
which is fastened such that it laterally adjoins the<br>
old installation frame 6 in the inner body 21 of the<br>
new body 3, which according to Figure 4a may take place<br>
already before the slipping-over of the new inner body<br>
21 or of the new body 3, or else subsequently.<br><br>
Similarly - as a departure from Figures 1 to 6 - the<br>
inner body 21 may be slipped over when already paneled<br>
with side walls, a rear wall and a front flap and rear<br>
flap, that is to say in the state which can be seen in<br>
Figures 5 .<br>
Figures 5, in particular Figure 5c, also show the<br>
fixing of the old installation frame 6, in particular<br>
in the upper region - to the new body 3, which<br>
preferably takes place by means of screwing a piece of<br>
perforated strip 14, which preferably consists of metal<br>
or plastic, the middle region of which is screwed to<br>
the upper end, for example, of the old installation<br>
frame 6, and the ends of which that point obliquely<br>
upwards to the front and rear are screwed to the front<br>
and rear edge profiles 17, running in the transverse<br>
direction 20, of the body frame 16, preferably by<br>
screwing to sliding blocks 17, which are displaceable<br>
in corresponding undercut grooves along these edge<br>
profiles 17.<br>
Figure 6 shows the final state, that is to say - once<br>
the lifting lugs 12 have been removed again - after<br>
placing the roof model 50 onto the upper side of the<br>
remaining new body 3 and connection to the latter.<br><br><br><br>
