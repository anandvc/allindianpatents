				<td>Process and apparatus<br>
for removing coatings from regions of glass plates<br>
The invention relates to a process having the features of<br>
the introductory part of Claim 1 and to an apparatus having<br>
the features of the introductory part of Claim 18.<br>
For many applications, transparent substrates, in<br>
particular plates made of glass or plastic but also films<br>
for example made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate), are<br>
provided with coatings before being brought into their<br>
final processing state. For example, in order to<br>
manufacture insulating glass (at least two individual<br>
plates joined to one another by means of a spacer frame),<br>
use is made of plates which have a coating, in particular a<br>
metal-containing coating, in order to reduce their<br>
permeability, in particular to heat rays, that is to say in<br>
the infrared range, and in order to influence the passage<br>
of light as a whole in the desired manner. The same heat-<br>
reflecting purpose can also be achieved in composite<br>
plates, in which case the coated surface lies within the<br>
composite.<br>
The term coating is understood here to mean not only a<br>
simple, single-layer coating but in particular also layer<br>
systems which consist of a number of individual layers, be<br>
they metal layers, oxide layers, nitride layers, organic<br>
layers or mixtures thereof.<br>
Anti-reflection or reflection-reducing layers are also<br>
often applied to such transparent substrates, with heat-<br>
reflecting layer systems usually comprising such anti-<br>
reflection layers in any case. Other applications or<br>
functions require, for example, hydrophobic or hydrophilic<br>
coatings on the substrate surfaces which are exposed to<br>
weather conditions.<br>
Besides purely passive use purposes such as the<br>
aforementioned heat insulation or infrared reflection,<br>
electrically conductive (metal-containing) coatings may<br>
also be used actively as panel heating systems or as<br>
antenna arrays. Water-repelling and/or self-cleaning<br>
properties of such coatings are likewise known, as are<br>
electrochromic, thermochromic, etc. coatings. Such coated<br>
(window) panes or plates are used in the construction<br>
industry and in all types of motor vehicle and aircraft.<br>
It is advantageous to coat the substrates, e.g. float<br>
glass, over large surface areas in suitably large systems<br>
(this is usually carried out by sputtering or CVD) , and to<br>
subsequently cut and further process the required smaller<br>
substrates.<br>
For various reasons, an initially large-surface-area<br>
coating sometimes has to be partially/locally removed for<br>
the final use purpose of the respective substrate, and this<br>
may take place before or after the cutting operation.<br>
If, for example, coated glass plates are used for<br>
insulating glass, these are arranged such that their coated<br>
side faces the interior of the insulating glass, that is to<br>
say the air gap, in order that the mechanically sensitive<br>
coating is as well protected as possible. One problem with<br>
insulating glass comprising at least one coated glass plate<br>
is that the customary compounds for joining the edges<br>
(butyl rubber and polysulphide as sealing compound) adhere<br>
poorly to the metal-containing coating and thus the<br>
strength of the edge join and the diffusion-tightness are<br>
not ensured to the desired extent. In the case of composite<br>
plates, the reduced adhesion is not very problematic on<br>
account of the large-area gluing of the rigid plates.<br>
A similar adhesion problem may arise in the case of other,<br>
in particular hydrophobic or hydrophilic or anti-<br>
reflective, coated substrates or surfaces if accessory<br>
parts, such as seals or window lift mechanisms, are to be<br>
adhesively fixed to these surfaces.<br>
In general, in such and similar use cases, direct adhesion<br>
of the aforementioned and other accessory parts to the<br>
uncoated substrate surface is preferred, since the<br>
available adhesives are suited to this and in order to as<br>
far as possible minimize the number of boundary layers<br>
involved.<br>
One problem in particular with metal-containing coatings is<br>
also that the metal parts or layers nay corrode under<br>
environmental influences. This risk of damage occurs in<br>
particular in the case of insulating glass which is<br>
designed as so-called stepped glass, in which the glass<br>
plates are of different size so that at least one of the<br>
glass plates of stepped glass protrudes beyond the other<br>
glass plate at least at one edge section. A metal-<br>
containing coating in the region of the glass plate which<br>
protrudes beyond the other glass plate may corrode and thus<br>
not only be of unpleasant appearance but also impair the<br>
tightness of the edge join of insulating glass.<br>
However, the abovementioned corrosion problem also occurs<br>
in the case of coated substrates which for example are<br>
installed in cars (windscreens or composite plates in<br>
general) . Although in this case too the coating is on a<br>
surface lying within the composite, without special<br>
protective measures corrosion damage which advances from<br>
the edge of the substrate to the face thereof occurs in<br>
this case too.<br>
For other reasons, too, it may be beneficial to remove the<br>
coating from part-areas of a substrate. If, for example,<br>
substrates coated with a metal-containing coating are<br>
installed as antenna or shield plates in metal frames, it<br>
may be necessary to omit the coating around this metal<br>
frame or at least partially at a distance therefrom. In the<br>
case of the antenna in cars, this for example prevents<br>
capacitive coupling of the antenna array with the vehicle<br>
bodywork. Furthermore, from time to time deliberate<br>
radiation transmission through an area ("communication<br>
window") coated with a (metal-containing) coating is<br>
required, for example for infrared remote controls, toll<br>
cost detection systems, etc.<br>
In the case of hydrophobic coatings, it may be advantageous<br>
for example to remove the coating from regions for the use<br>
of sensors (rain sensor) or in general from a window (for<br>
example in the "rear-view mirror region" of a side window).<br>
Finally, it may also be necessary to remove a coating<br>
consisting of a number of layers only partially in the<br>
sense that only one or more top layers of a layer system<br>
are removed while one or more underlying layers are left on<br>
the substrate. This is preferred in particular if one or<br>
more remaining (base) layer(s) does not impair further use<br>
of the substrate or is even necessary.<br>
In order to eliminate these aforementioned problems and to<br>
satisfy the requirements, it is known to remove the<br>
coating, in particular in the edge region, with a specific<br>
width or on a specific area. For this purpose, apparatuses<br>
are known which can be used to remove the coating, at least<br>
in the edge region, from (metal-)coated glass plates if<br>
they are to be used for insulating glass or other use<br>
purposes mentioned above. Such apparatuses operate with<br>
thermal devices (gas flames or plasma, cf. DE 34 03 682 C)<br>
or with mechanical devices such as grinding or polishing<br>
wheels. By way of example, reference may be made to<br>
EP 0 517 176 A (=DE 41 18 241 A), DE 43 42 067 A or<br>
EP 603 152 A.<br>
One advantage of plasma treatment (at atmospheric pressure)<br>
for removing coatings is that there are no significant<br>
problems with positioning the plasma treatment device or<br>
the plasma head in relation to the substrate surface,<br>
whereas in mechanical abrasive apparatuses imprecise<br>
positioning of the grinding wheels is a considerable source<br>
of error, particularly if the grinding wheels exhibit<br>
relatively pronounced wear.<br>
However, one problem when removing coatings from glass or<br>
plastic plates, even if this is carried out using plasma,<br>
is that the width or area of the region from which the<br>
coating is removed cannot readily be changed during the<br>
coating removal operation, so that if a wider region from<br>
which the coating is to be removed is required, the region<br>
from which the coating is to be removed has to be passed<br>
over a number of times.<br>
This has a disruptive or slowing effect during the<br>
manufacture of stepped insulating glass comprising at least<br>
one coated glass plate. If the two glass plates have<br>
different dimensions (e.g. "stepped element") and the<br>
coated glass plate has the greater surface area, it is<br>
necessary to select the region from which the coating is to<br>
be removed to be wider in the protruding regions than has<br>
to date been possible.<br>
One problem with the known processes and apparatuses for<br>
removing coatings is also that, when using just one plasma<br>
head, the region from which the coating is to be removed<br>
also has to be passed over a number of times if this region<br>
is a non-integer multiple, for example one and a half<br>
times, the effective width of the plasma head for the<br>
coating removal operation.<br>
Such multiple operations are a great hindrance from the<br>
production technology standpoint because they may<br>
considerably increase the time requirement per substrate<br>
and thus reduce the efficiency of the system.<br>
With some systems of the conventional type which are<br>
equipped with a single plasma head or one plasma nozzle,<br>
the width of the region from which the coating is removed<br>
can be changed within a range of +/- 3 mm, for example by<br>
changing the radiation intensity of the plasma.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a process and<br>
an apparatus which make it possible to adjust the width of<br>
the region in which an existing coating is removed to the<br>
desired size in each case.<br>
This object is achieved in terms of the process by the<br>
features of process claim 1.<br>
With regard to the apparatus, the object on which the<br>
invention is based is achieved by the features of apparatus<br>
claim 18.<br>
Advantageous and preferred refinements of the process<br>
according to the invention and of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention form the subject matter of the dependent<br>
claims which in each case follow the independent claims.<br>
The invention involves bringing the area in which the<br>
plasma hits the substrate (working region, coverage region<br>
or coating removal region) into correspondence as precisely<br>
as possible with the area or width on which the coating has<br>
to be removed. This does not rule out the possibility of<br>
the plasma also going beyond the edge of the substrate,<br>
that is to say extending beyond the region from which the<br>
coating is to be removed or even if necessary hitting the<br>
end edge of the substrate from which the coating is<br>
possibly also to be removed.<br>
Since, according to the invention, the width or area of the<br>
region in which the coating is removed can be changed in a<br>
targeted manner by controlled changing of the effective<br>
width or area of the plasma beam directed from a plasma<br>
source (head, nozzle, etc.) onto the coated substrate, it<br>
is possible to remove the coating during preparation of the<br>
substrates for their subsequent uses, as mentioned above,<br>
to the desired extent in each case, in particular at the<br>
edge, in a quicker and more flexible manner than has<br>
hitherto been possible.<br>
It should be noted that the terms "plasma source" or<br>
"plasma head" which are repeatedly used below are to be<br>
understood as meaning in general all conceivable forms of<br>
outlet openings which can direct a plasma or a plasma beam<br>
in more or less bundled form in a targeted manner onto a<br>
substrate or onto a coated surface. These may have fixed or<br>
variable cross sections, wherein it is also possible where<br>
necessary to adjust relative to one another multiple heads<br>
which are combined to form groups, in order to change the<br>
width of the working region and/or the plasma energy per<br>
unit of area treated.<br>
The possibility is obtained of selecting different coating<br>
removal widths in different regions and/or edge sections of<br>
a substrate. In particular, it is possible to change during<br>
the treatment the width or area of the region of the<br>
substrate in which the latter is to have its coating<br>
removed, and thus in the best case to remove the coating<br>
from the entire area in one operation to the required<br>
extent.<br>
A further advantage of this procedure according to the<br>
invention is achieved in that, if required, at the same<br>
time as removing the coating from the (main) face of the<br>
substrate, the coating can also be removed from the end<br>
edge or face thereof if there is also a coating there<br>
(overspray, original edge has remained unaffected during<br>
the model cutting operation, etc.). If coating removal on<br>
the end edge is necessary, it may be expedient according to<br>
the invention to then also allow the plasma beams to hit<br>
this end edge directly (essentially in the normal<br>
direction) . For this, it may be useful to guide the plasma<br>
heads or nozzles accordingly in a pivotable manner.<br>
It is advantageous in the invention in one embodiment that<br>
the width of the region from which the coating is removed<br>
can be set independently of the diameter or dimensions of<br>
an individual plasma head used to emit or output a plasma<br>
beam.<br>
It is also advantageous in the invention that the time<br>
taken to remove the coating on the edge or face is<br>
shortened even in the case of relatively wide working or<br>
coating removal regions, since it is no longer necessary to<br>
pass over the coating removal region a number of times in<br>
order to achieve the desired width of the region (strip)<br>
from which the coating is removed.<br>
If, according to the invention, coating removal is carried<br>
out using at least two plasma heads, in one embodiment<br>
there is the advantageous possibility of aligning the<br>
plasma heads relative to the edge of the glass plate from<br>
which the coating is to be removed in some regions, such<br>
that one of the plasma heads acts on the coating only<br>
partially, e.g. only with a third of its possible effective<br>
width. The width of the region from which the coating is to<br>
be removed can thus be selected freely and changed during<br>
the machining operation by suitably positioning the plasma<br>
heads, without having to pass over the edge of the glass<br>
plate a number of times.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to operate only some of<br>
several plasma heads if the desire is to remove the coating<br>
from a narrow strip, and to activate or switch on<br>
additional heads or nozzles if the coating is to be removed<br>
from a greater width or area.<br>
If, in the apparatus according to the invention, the<br>
carrier for the at least two plasma heads can rotate about<br>
an axis perpendicular to the plane of the substrate from<br>
which the coating is to be removed, with such a device the<br>
substrate can be passed over all the way round in order to<br>
remove its coating over the entire edge region or over part<br>
of its periphery. If there is continuous rotatability of<br>
the plasma heads, which are arranged in at least one row,<br>
it is also possible to pass over any contours (shaped or<br>
model plates) , and the orientation of the row of plasma<br>
heads will advantageously always be perpendicular to the<br>
edge of the glass plate. However, changes to the coating<br>
removal width may also be achieved, for example, by<br>
targeted deviation of the angle of said row with respect to<br>
the substrate edge or to the direction of advance of the<br>
coating removal operation.<br>
In general, the desire with the treatment process according<br>
to the invention is to achieve as sharp and as clean an<br>
edge of the coating as possible in the transition from the<br>
coated area to the area from which the coating has been<br>
removed. According to one advantageous development of the<br>
invention, it is therefore possible to provide a flat<br>
shield which prevents uncontrolled spreading of the plasma<br>
beam or plasma beams from the respectively operating heads.<br>
Using a suitable "travelling" shield which for example<br>
surrounds the actual current working area (the current<br>
coverage region of plasma and substrate) in the manner of a<br>
frame, it is furthermore possible to prevent layer<br>
particles that have already been removed from settling in<br>
the form of an "overspray" on the surfaces that have still<br>
to be machined or on the adjacent surfaces, on the end edge<br>
or even (when working along the substrate edge) on the<br>
surface lying opposite. Such a flat shield may also<br>
minimize re-settling of layer particles that have already<br>
been removed on areas that have already had their coating<br>
removed.<br>
The shield is advantageously moved and positioned together<br>
with the plasma heads, wherein it should not touch the<br>
remaining coating despite a spacing that is as small as<br>
possible.<br>
In addition, in a manner known per se, a device may also be<br>
carried which immediately discharges the detached layer<br>
particles (e.g. pneumatic suction). Such suction may<br>
optionally be associated with a shield of the<br>
aforementioned type.<br>
With a plasma treatment under atmospheric pressure of the<br>
type described here, it is possible if necessary to remove<br>
only part-layers of a layer system in a much simpler manner<br>
than using the mechanical method. If the part-layers are of<br>
different type (organic, metal, oxide, nitride,<br>
hydrophobic/hydrophilic), the plasma may optionally be<br>
generated in a layer-specific or material-specific manner<br>
(for example by using etching gases or reactive gases<br>
specifically adapted to the material to be removed and/or<br>
by controlling the process parameters such as, e.g., gas<br>
flow, flow rate), in order to carry out a selective etching<br>
or burn-off process.<br>
By controlling the energy or degree of activation of the<br>
plasma, it is also possible for example to vary the<br>
penetration depth of the plasma and thus the extent to<br>
which the coating is removed perpendicular to the substrate<br>
surface.<br>
Finally, it may also be desirable or necessary to provide a<br>
gradual transition from the coated area to the region from<br>
which the coating has been removed. This may be necessary<br>
for example for optical reasons but also for functional<br>
reasons. By splitting a plasma source into a number of<br>
individually controllable beam heads or nozzles, according<br>
to the present invention it is also possible to achieve<br>
such a differentiated removal of the coating. It is<br>
possible for example to configure part of the plasma for<br>
complete coating removal and to configure another part for<br>
selective coating removal only of top layers of a layer<br>
system.<br>
It should furthermore be noted that, using the process<br>
according to the invention and the associated apparatus, it<br>
is also possible to treat and remove the coating from non-<br>
planar (e.g. bent or pre-shaped) coated substrates (for<br>
example for inclusion in glass or plastic panes provided in<br>
front, rear or side windows of vehicles), if the device for<br>
guiding the plasma heads (and possibly the abovementioned<br>
shield) has the required adjustability not only in one<br>
plane but also in space. Maintaining the normal distance<br>
between plasma head and substrate or coating is of course<br>
particularly critical on bent substrates.<br>
Since the principle of plasma coating removal is known per<br>
se, there is no need to provide further details regarding<br>
the plasma or the generation thereof. In brief, according<br>
to the invention, the process is usually carried out under<br>
atmospheric pressure, as already mentioned. The plasma is<br>
generated by supplying power to form a gas beam which,<br>
prior to hitting the substrate or the coating, is activated<br>
by supplying electromagnetic energy (e.g. DC current,<br>
radiofrequency or microwaves) , in order to influence its<br>
reactivity, its energy, its temperature and its ionization.<br>
Depending on the type of layer that is to be removed, a<br>
suitably reactive plasma will be selected, with it being<br>
possible to treat all layers of the types mentioned in the<br>
introduction. It is also conceivable to use the plasma<br>
independently of the coating removal operation per se to<br>
activate (or roughen) the substrate surface in order for<br>
example to further improve the adhesion of adhesives that<br>
are to be subsequently applied.<br>
Further details, features and advantages of the process<br>
according to the invention and of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention emerge from the following description of a<br>
non-limiting example of embodiment of an apparatus, with<br>
reference to the drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows, schematically and in an oblique view, an<br>
apparatus for carrying out the process according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows, on an enlarged scale, a detail of the<br>
apparatus from Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a detail of a shield and suction device<br>
combined with the plasma treatment apparatus.<br>
An apparatus shown in Fig. 1 consists of a base frame 1 in<br>
which a supporting wall 2 is fixed. The supporting wall 2<br>
may, as shown, be designed as an air cushion wall and for<br>
this purpose has a number of openings 3 which are acted<br>
upon by compressed air so that an air cushion is formed<br>
between the supporting wall 2, which is covered with felt<br>
for example, and a glass plate 4 leaning against said wall.<br>
The design and orientation of the supporting wall 2 is not<br>
important per se. Supporting walls with cylinders or<br>
rollers or any other sliding surfaces are also conceivable.<br>
Of course, unlike in the diagram, the supporting wall may<br>
also be flat or inclined slightly with respect to the<br>
horizontal as a treatment plane for the substrates.<br>
In order to transport the glass plate 4, a conveying device<br>
5 of any type, such as conveying belts or conveying<br>
rollers, is provided at the lower edge of the supporting<br>
wall 2. Additional conveying aids which assist precise<br>
positioning (double arrow 9, Fig. 2) of the glass plate 4<br>
may likewise be provided. In the case of a treatment plane<br>
which is horizontal or inclined slightly with respect to<br>
the horizontal, suitable positioning means are<br>
correspondingly provided.<br>
In front of the supporting surface 2, which is inclined<br>
slightly (3 to 5°) backwards from the vertical, there is a<br>
bar 6 which is fixedly connected to the base frame 1. A<br>
support plate 7 (carriage) can move along the bar 6 (arrow<br>
14) on a guide (not shown) arranged on the bar 6 by means<br>
of a (linear) drive (not shown).<br>
The support plate 7 has a carrier 8 on which five plasma<br>
heads 10 are mounted next to one another in a row in the<br>
example of embodiment shown (Fig. 2). The carrier 8 for the<br>
plasma heads 10 can be pivoted on the support plate 7 about<br>
an axis (double arrow 18 in Fig. 2) perpendicular to the<br>
glass plate 4. It is thus possible to align the row of<br>
plasma heads 10 always perpendicular to the edge of a glass<br>
plate 4 from which the coating is to be removed in the edge<br>
region 11, even if the plasma heads 10 are moved along the<br>
entire periphery of the glass plate 4, and thus in<br>
principle to ensure a uniform treatment width. Unlike in<br>
the diagram, it is of course also possible to provide a<br>
number of rows of plasma heads which may possibly be offset<br>
from one another.<br>
In addition, the carrier 8 with the plasma heads 10 may be<br>
mounted on the support plate 7 such that it can be adjusted<br>
in the longitudinal direction thereof (arrow 12) , that is<br>
to say in the direction of the row of plasma heads 10. The<br>
purpose of this is to arrange in the region of the glass<br>
plate 4 or in the vertical projection onto the substrate<br>
over a coverage area in each case as many plasma heads 10<br>
as corresponds to the desired coating removal width. Plasma<br>
heads which project beyond the edge of the substrate may<br>
optionally be switched off or even (partially) activated in<br>
order to act upon the end face of the substrate with<br>
plasma.<br>
It is thereby also possible to orient the carrier 8 with<br>
the plasma heads 10 such that one plasma head 10 - the one<br>
assigned to the edge of the glass plate 4 - is oriented<br>
such that it acts on the glass plate only with part of its<br>
effective width for coating removal purposes. In this way,<br>
it is possible to remove the coating from a region having a<br>
width which is not equal to an integer multiple of the<br>
effective width of the plasma heads 10 used.<br>
In the drawings of the example, round plasma heads are<br>
shown for the sake of simplicity, said round plasma heads<br>
being arranged in a row. However, it is also within the<br><br>
scope of the present invention for the cross sections of<br>
the plasma heads or nozzles to be designed otherwise, e.g.<br>
in the shape of a slit, wherein the effective width of the<br>
respective slit may also be variable. Such a change in the<br>
opening may be produced for example by movable screens<br>
which can be positioned by external force (electrically,<br>
pneumatically, etc.) and/or once again by the individual<br>
use of individual nozzles or plasma sources which may be<br>
arranged offset from one another.<br>
It can readily be seen from Fig. 2, and therefore does not<br>
need to be shown specifically, that, unlike in the drawing,<br>
instead of the row of (round) plasma heads 10, it would<br>
also be possible to use one or more si-it nozzles which<br>
individually could cover the entire row or width covered by<br>
the heads 10 or in each case only a part thereof (with it<br>
being possible for a number of slit nozzles to overlap<br>
slightly in the direction of advance). Changes to the width<br>
of the coating removal region 11 may then obviously also be<br>
brought about by changing the angle of incidence of the<br>
slit nozzle (s) relative to the direction of advance (this<br>
is of course also possible using the heads 10 by changing<br>
the angle of incidence of the row formed by them in an<br>
analogous manner). Another possibility consists in changing<br>
the mutual offset of the slit nozzles if a number of slit<br>
nozzles are provided. Finally, as already mentioned<br>
earlier, slit nozzles or in general plasma heads with<br>
variable cross sections could also be used.<br>
An electronically controlled motor may be provided in order<br>
to move the support plate 7 along the bar 6 on the guides<br>
(not shown) in the direction of the arrow 14.<br>
The support plate 7 may be adjusted by a:n actuating motor<br>
in a direction (arrow 16) perpendicular to the surface of<br>
the glass plate 4 and the supporting wall 2, in order to<br>
place the plasma heads 10 at the correct distance in each<br>
case from the surface of the glass plate 4, as a function<br>
also of the thickness of the glass plate 4 from which the<br>
coating is to be removed in the edge region 11.<br>
A motor with integrated incremental sensor (not shown) is<br>
provided in order to rotate (arrow 18) the carrier 8 with<br>
the plasma heads 10 with respect to the retaining plate 7<br>
about an axis perpendicular to the glass plate 4 .<br>
Any linear motors (e.g. electric, pneumatic) may be<br>
provided in order to displace the carrier 8 with the plasma<br>
heads 10 relative to the support plate 7.<br>
Unlike in the diagram, on the one hand it may be possible<br>
for the support bar 6 to move back and forth along the<br>
guide. On the other hand, the guide for the plasma heads<br>
may also be fitted with two or more guides that are<br>
perpendicular to one another, in the manner of a 2D<br>
plotter. Further precisely guided degrees of freedom may<br>
possibly be required, in particular to machine substrates<br>
that are not planar, as mentioned above. However, no<br>
further details are given in this respect since such<br>
apparatuses are known per se from the prior art.<br>
The apparatus described above operates as follows:<br>
A glass plate 4 is aligned in the correct position with<br>
respect to the plasma heads 10 on the carrier 8, said glass<br>
plate standing with its lower edge on the conveying device<br>
5 and being supported against the supporting surface 2 via<br>
the air cushion. Firstly, the carrier 8 with the plasma<br>
heads 10 is oriented such that the plasma heads 10 are<br>
aligned in a row perpendicular to a first,, vertical edge of<br>
the glass plate 4 . The number of plasma heads 10 arranged<br>
opposite the glass plate 4 must correspond to the desired<br>
width of coating removal 11 (alternatively, it is possible<br>
to set in operation only as many of the plasma heads 10 as<br>
necessary to correspond to the desired width of coating<br>
removal 11) . The support plate 7 together with the carrier<br>
8 and the plasma heads 10 is then moved upwards along the<br>
vertical edge of the glass plate 4 (arrow 14) in order to<br>
remove the coating from the first vertical edge of the<br>
glass plate 4 (region 11, Fig. 2) . By rotating the carrier<br>
8 with the plasma heads 10 through 90°, the plasma heads 10<br>
are now oriented such that they are aligned in a row<br>
perpendicular to the top horizontal edge of the glass plate<br>
4. The glass plate 4 is then moved along the supporting<br>
surface 2 so that the coating is removed from the top edge<br>
(alternatively, there is the possibility of keeping the<br>
glass plate stationary and moving the bar 6, on which the<br>
support plate 7 and the carrier 8 are arranged, in the<br>
horizontal direction along the supporting surface 2) . Once<br>
the coating has been removed from the top edge of the glass<br>
plate 4, the carrier 8 is once again pivoted through 90°<br>
and the coating is removed from the second vertical edge of<br>
the glass plate 4, wherein the carrier 8 with the support<br>
plate 7 moves downwards. The glass plate 4 remains<br>
stationary.<br>
Finally, the coating is removed from the lower horizontal<br>
edge of the glass plate 4 by moving the glass plate 4<br>
relative to the carrier 8 with the plasma heads 10, which<br>
carrier 8 has once again been pivoted through 90°.<br>
The coating removal itself takes place on the one hand by<br>
the action of heat under the effect of the (possibly<br>
multiple) plasma beam directed from the plasma heads 10<br>
onto the glass plate 4. On the other hand, chemical coating<br>
removal mechanisms (etching) may be used, especially by<br>
using reactive gases in the plasma. Fluorine-containing<br>
gases are particularly suitable for such processes.<br>
It can be seen that, with the apparatus according to the<br>
invention, the width of coating removal can be selected at<br>
will by selecting the number of plasma heads 10 that are<br>
used in a manner corresponding to the width 11, and/or by<br>
orienting the plasma heads 10 by moving the carrier 8 in a<br>
linear manner such that only the plasma heads 10 required<br>
in each case for the desired coating removal width are<br>
arranged opposite the glass plate 4. It is also possible to<br>
remove the coating from various edge sections 11 of<br>
different width on the same glass plate 4.<br>
Finally, Fig. 3 shows, once again highly schematically, a<br>
shield 20 which directly adjoins the working region 11' of<br>
the plasma heads 10. The plasma heads are in this case<br>
represented only by the emerging beam which hits the coated<br>
substrate 4 or the coating 22, which in this case is shown<br>
as a grey covering (shown with a highly pronounced<br>
thickness for the sake of clarity). The relative mobility<br>
between the plasma beam and the substrate 4 is indicated by<br>
a horizontal double arrow. It can be seen that the coating<br>
22 to the right of the beam is still intact, whereas it has<br>
been removed to the left of the beam. In the lower region<br>
of the plasma beam, directly above the surface of the<br>
substrate 4, it is shown that the particles detached there<br>
from the coating may be in undefined states of motion.<br>
The shield 20 may surround the working region 11' in the<br>
manner of a frame. It is intended to prevent contamination<br>
of the coating or re-coating of regions or areas from which<br>
the coating has already been removed by detached particles<br>
of the coating 22. In addition, as also shown schematically<br>
here, a suction device 24 may be provided which irr.mediately<br>
removes the detached particles, if necessary, and possibly<br>
of course also particularly reactive (e.g. fluorine-<br>
containing) working gases, and disposes of them (or in the<br>
case of working gases recycles them). This discharge device<br>
will expediently be combined with the shield 20 and guided<br>
synchronously with the latter, if both are provided in the<br>
system at the same time.<br>
