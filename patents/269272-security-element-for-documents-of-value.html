				<td>Security element for value documents<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a security element for securing value documents<br>
which has magnetic material. Further, the invention relates to a value document and to<br>
a film material having the security element and to a method for checking such a security<br>
element or value document.<br>
[0002] A value document refers for the purposes of the invention to bank notes, but<br>
also shares, deeds, postage stamps, checks, admission tickets, travel tickets, air tickets,<br>
identity cards, visa stickers and the like, as well as labels, seals, packages, security paper<br>
or other elements for product protection. Therefore, the simplifying designation<br>
"value document" will hereinafter always include documents of the stated kind.<br>
[0003] It is known that bank notes, for example, have magnetic material which is<br>
used for checking the authenticity of the bank notes. Such magnetic material is for example<br>
a component of printing inks and applied to the bank notes upon printing<br>
thereof. For checking the authenticity of the bank notes, the distribution of the magnetic<br>
material produced upon printing can be determined and compared to a specification.<br>
Further, it is known that magnetic material can be contained in security elements<br>
applied to the bank note. For example, security threads can have magnetic material<br>
which can be applied either continuously or in the form of a coding.<br>
[0004] Further, it is known to embed security threads in bank-note paper partially or<br>
completely. A partially embedded security thread is visible only in certain places on<br>
the surface of the bank note, for example in periodically disposed windows in the<br>
bank-note paper. Upon viewing in reflected light, such a (continuously metallized)<br>
windowed security thread appears as a periodically visible metallization strip extending<br>
e.g. perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the bank note.<br>
[0005] For imitating a windowed security thread, forgers affix for example metallized<br>
film strips to forged bank notes which resemble a windowed security thread<br>
when viewed in reflected light. It has turned out that such forgeries cause a certain (inductive)<br>
measuring signal upon examination with magnetic sensors, although the metallized<br>
film strip has no magnetic material. On the other hand, authentic bank notes<br><br>
that are in a poor state can also cause a similar measuring signal. Hence, upon checking<br>
the bank notes there is a risk of bank notes that are authentic but in a poor state<br>
being incorrectly considered to be forgeries with thus imitated security threads and<br>
being mistakenly sorted out.<br>
[0006] Hence, the invention is based on the object of providing a more easily verifiable<br>
security element, a value document having the security element, and a film material<br>
having the security element, and an improved measuring method for checking<br>
value documents having the security element.<br>
[0007] This object is achieved by the features of the independent claims. Developments<br>
are the object of the subclaims.<br>
[0008] According to the invention, the security element has magnetic material<br>
which is applied to or incorporated in the security element. In particular, the security<br>
element possesses a magnetic coding which is formed by a certain arrangement of<br>
magnetic areas and gap areas. The security element has at least one magnetic area<br>
which continuously contains magnetic material and at least one gap area which continuously<br>
contains no magnetic material and/or which continuously has a lower rema-<br>
nent flux density than the magnetic area. The term "continuously" is to be understood<br>
for the purposes of this application as continuously along an imaginary straight line.<br>
The magnetic and gaps areas are disposed along the security element along a given<br>
direction which preferably extends parallel to a longitudinal direction of the security<br>
element. The longitudinal direction of the security element refers here to the direction<br>
in which the security element possesses its greatest extension.<br>
[0009] To permit a clear differentiation from the imitated windowed security<br>
threads mentioned at the outset, a magnetic coding is applied, for example in the form<br>
of a few individual gap areas within an otherwise continuously magnetic security element.<br>
Alternatively, the magnetic coding can also be applied in form of a few individual<br>
magnetic areas which within a security element which is otherwise free from magnetic<br>
material or which otherwise continuously has magnetic properties which deviate<br>
from those of the magnetic areas. Preferably, the magnetic areas and/or the gap areas<br>
are disposed in or on the security element such that they differ from the arrangement<br><br>
of the windows on or in the substrate of the value document where the security ele-<br>
ment is visible on at least one surface of the value document, such as of the bank-note<br>
paper, or where the security element passes to at least one surface of the value docu-<br>
ment. The magnetic areas or the gap areas can be disposed along the security element<br>
for example periodically, but with a period deviating from the window period, but they<br>
can also be present on the security element in the form of individual non-periodically<br>
disposed areas. The security element has maximally five magnetic areas and/or maxi-<br>
mally five gap areas along the given direction. However, the security element prefera-<br>
bly possesses only maximally four or maximally three magnetic areas and/or gap areas<br>
along the given direction. It is in particular also possible, however, to use a security<br>
element with only one or with two magnetic areas and/or gap areas along the given<br>
direction. The statement of a number of magnetic areas or gaps areas along a given<br>
direction refers to the number of magnetic areas or gap areas in or on the security ele-<br>
ment that exist along an imaginary, straight line over the total security element.<br>
[0010] The magnetic areas and/or gaps areas extend in one embodiment across the<br>
total width of the security element. The width of the security element is the extension<br>
perpendicular to the given direction along which the magnetic areas and/or gap areas<br>
are disposed, i.e. for example the extension of the magnetic areas and/or gap areas<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the security element. In a further em-<br>
bodiment, the magnetic areas are disposed in one or in both edge areas of the security<br>
element. They can form one or more edge tracks disposed in or on the security element<br>
parallel to the given direction. For example, the magnetic areas of the security element<br>
can form two edge tracks extending parallel to each other. In or on the areas of the se-<br>
curity element disposed outside the magnetic areas there can be provided identifying<br>
elements such as characters, symbols, text or also patterns. Said identifying elements<br>
can identify the security element individually, i.e. according to its area of application,<br>
e.g. according to the kind of value document to be secured. The identifying elements<br>
can be disposed on or in the security element outside the edge tracks, for example be-<br>
tween the two edge tracks.<br>
[0011] In a first embodiment, at least one magnetic area is extended along the given<br>
direction over at least 15 mm, preferably over at least 20 mm, particularly preferably<br><br>
over 20 mm to 40 mm. For example, all those magnetic areas that are limited along the<br>
given direction by gap areas - which excludes those magnetic areas that are limited<br>
along the given direction by an edge of the security element - extend over at least 15<br>
mm, preferably over at least 20 mm, particularly preferably over 20 mm to 40 mm. In<br>
said first embodiment, at least one gap area - preferably all gap areas that are limited<br>
along the given direction by magnetic areas - extend along the given direction for ex-<br>
ample over 1 mm to 5 mm, preferably over 2 mm to 4 mm, particularly preferably over<br>
about 3 mm.<br>
[0012] In a second embodiment, which is complementary to the first embodiment,<br>
at least one gap area extends along the given direction over at least 15 mm, preferably<br>
over at least 20 mm, particularly preferably over 20 mm to 40 mm. Preferably, all gap<br>
areas that are limited along the given direction by magnetic areas - which excludes<br>
those gap areas that are limited along the given direction by an edge of the security<br>
element - are extended over at least 15 mm, preferably over at least 20 mm, particu-<br>
larly preferably over 20 mm to 40 mm. For example, in said second embodiment, at<br>
least one magnetic area - preferably all those magnetic areas that are limited by gap<br>
areas along the given direction - extend along the given direction for example over 1<br>
mm to 5 mm, preferably over 2 mm to 4 mm, particularly preferably over about 3 mm.<br>
[0013] For realizing a continuously lower remanent flux density in a gap area, there<br>
can be chosen in the gap area for example a lower concentration of magnetic material<br>
than in the magnetic area. Alternatively or additionally, it is also possible that a<br>
smaller layer thickness or also a smaller width of the magnetic material or also a dif-<br>
ferent magnetic material is applied in the gap area than in the magnetic area. In the gap<br>
area the remanent flux density and/or the concentration of magnetic material and/or the<br>
layer thickness and/or the width of magnetic material can be for example less than<br>
50%, in particular less than 10%, of the remanent flux density and/or the concentration<br>
of magnetic material and/or the layer thickness and/or the width of magnetic material<br>
in the magnetic area.<br>
[0014] In an especially preferred embodiment, the extension of the gap areas or the<br>
magnetic areas is so chosen that there results a constructive interference of the mag-<br><br>
netic signals, in particular of the individual pulses, which are detected by a magnetic<br>
sensor at the beginning and at the end of the particular area. By means of the construc-<br>
tive interference of individual pulses there is obtained on the magnetic sensor a meas-<br>
uring signal with a greater maximum amplitude than the individual pulses themselves<br>
have. This can be used advantageously in the case of relatively small signal amplitudes<br>
as occur for example with the magnetic signals of security threads in transverse trans-<br>
port of bank notes.<br>
[0015] The magnetic areas and gap areas are limited along the given direction by<br>
magnetization steps. A magnetization step is understood for the purposes of the appli-<br>
cation to be a steplike change in remanent flux density which arises at the transition<br>
between a magnetic area and a gap area. In a first embodiment, the gap areas are lim-<br>
ited along the given direction by a first and a second magnetization step. The first<br>
magnetization step of the gap area has a steplike drop in remanent flux density and/or<br>
concentration and/or layer thickness and/or width of the magnetic material, and the<br>
second magnetization step of the gap area has a steplike increase in remanent flux den-<br>
sity and/or concentration and/or layer thickness and/or width of the magnetic material.<br>
The distance between the magnetization steps is preferably chosen so great along the<br>
given direction that the magnetic signals of the first and second magnetization steps of<br>
the gap area interfere constructively with each other. In other words, the extension of<br>
the gap area along the given direction is chosen so great that the magnetic signals of<br>
the two transitions from the magnetic area preceding upon the magnetic-signal meas-<br>
urement to the gap area and from the gap area to the magnetic area following upon the<br>
magnetic-signal measurement interfere constructively.<br>
[0016] In a second embodiment, the magnetic areas are limited along the given di-<br>
rection by a first and a second magnetization step. The first magnetization step of the<br>
magnetic area has a steplike increase in remanent flux density and/or concentration<br>
and/or layer thickness and/or width of the magnetic material, and the second magneti-<br>
zation step of the magnetic area has a steplike drop in remanent flux density and/or<br>
concentration and/or layer thickness and/or width of the magnetic material. The dis-<br>
tance between the magnetization steps is preferably chosen so great along the given<br>
direction that the magnetic signals of the first and second magnetization steps of the<br><br>
magnetic area interfere constructively with each other. In other words, the extension of<br>
the magnetic area along the given direction is chosen so great that the magnetic signals<br>
of the two transitions from the gap area preceding upon the magnetic-signal measure-<br>
ment to the magnetic area and from the magnetic area to the gap area following upon<br>
the magnetic-signal measurement interfere constructively.<br>
[0017] The magnetic material used is for example magnetic pigments. The magnetic<br>
material has for example magnetically hard material, preferably one or more different<br>
iron compounds, particularly preferably one or more different iron oxides or magnet-<br>
ite.<br>
[0018] The security element can either be produced directly on the value document<br>
or be prepared on a separate substrate. If it would cause difficulties to provide the<br>
value document directly with the magnetic materials for example, it may be expedient<br>
to prepare the construction of the security element at least partly on the separate sub-<br>
strate. The separate substrate to which the security element can be applied preferably<br>
has plastic and can be, or have, for example a film material, in particular a transfer ma-<br>
terial.<br>
[0019] The security element, in particular the magnetic materials of the security<br>
element, can be applied for example in endless form to a carrier material of the transfer<br>
material. The fastening of the security element to a value document to be secured is<br>
effected here by means of an adhesive layer which is applied either to the value docu-<br>
ment or also to the uppermost layer of the transfer material. Preferably, a hot-melt ad-<br>
hesive is used therefor. To define the outline form of the security element, either an<br>
adhesive layer can be provided only in the areas to be transferred, or the adhesive is<br>
activated only in the areas to be transferred. After transfer, the carrier material of the<br>
transfer material is removed, leaving only the security element on the value document<br>
to be secured.<br>
[0020] The value document to which the security element is applied may be for ex-<br>
ample a security paper, a security document, but also product packages. Other objects<br>
of value requiring security-type protection can of course also be provided with the in-<br>
ventive security element.<br><br>
[0021] The security element can be applied for example to value documents in or on<br>
whose substrate, such as security paper, one or more windows are present. To improve<br>
the differentiation of authentic value documents from the forgeries mentioned at the<br>
outset, the gap areas and/or magnetic areas of the security element are disposed along<br>
the value document differently from the windows along the value document. The<br>
number of gap areas and/or the number of magnetic areas along the security element is<br>
preferably lower, preferably at least three lower, than the number of windows in or on<br>
the substrate of the value document where the security element is visible on at least<br>
one surface of the value document or where the security element passes to at least one<br>
surface of the value document.<br>
[0022] Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for checking value documents<br>
having one or more security elements wherein magnetic signals of the security element<br>
are measured. For checking the value document or the security element, the value<br>
document is transported past a magnetic sensor, and the magnetic signals of the secu-<br>
rity element are sensed by means of the magnetic sensor and supplied to an evaluation<br>
device. The transport direction of the value documents is for example parallel to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the security element which is disposed in or on the value<br>
document. Preferably, the magnetic areas and gap areas are so disposed along the se-<br>
curity element that at least the magnetic signals of two adjacent magnetization steps<br>
that limit a gap area or a magnetic area interfere constructively. The constructive inter-<br>
ference of the magnetic signals can be obtained for example with magnetic sensors<br>
that operate inductively or also magnetoresistively.<br>
[0023] The constructive interference of the magnetic signals of adjacent magnetiza-<br>
tion steps makes it possible to obtain an increase in maximum amplitude of the mag-<br>
netic signal compared with the pulse provided by the magnetic signal of an individual<br>
magnetization step. This permits value documents or security elements with relatively<br>
weak magnetic signals arising from the individual magnetization steps to be checked<br>
for their magnetic properties more reliably.<br>
[0024] Further advantages and embodiments of the invention will be explained<br>
more closely with reference to the figures. For reasons of clarity, the invention will be<br><br>
explained more closely only by the example of a bank note. However, it is evident that<br>
the invention can readily be used for the above-mentioned value documents.<br>
[0025]     There are shown:<br>

a bank note being transported past the magnetic sensor and having an<br>
inventive security element (magnetic areas and gap areas not shown),<br>

rity element in each case,<br>
Figures 3a-c an embodiment of a bank note having an inventive security element<br>
(Fig. 3a) as well as exemplary embodiments of the security element<br>
along the line A-A in cross section (Figs. 3b, 3c),<br>

tion steps of a gap area, and of the superimposition of said magnetic<br>
signals to form the resulting magnetic signal S3 upon constructive in-<br>
terference.<br>
[0026] In Figure 1 there is shown schematically a detail of an apparatus for check-<br>
ing bank notes for their magnetic properties. Bank notes 1 or security elements 2 to be<br>
checked are transported through the apparatus by a transport system (not shown) along<br>
the transport direction shown by the arrow in Figure 1. In the shown example, a bank<br>
note 1 is transported past an inductively operating magnetic sensor 10 in transverse<br>
transport. In so doing, the security element 2 which is disposed with its longitudinal<br>
direction along the transport direction of the bank note 1 is checked for its magnetic<br>
properties. The security element 2 is for example a security thread which is partially<br>
embedded in the bank-note substrate and passes to the surface thereof, or is visible on<br>
the surface thereof, only at windows 7. The magnetic sensor possesses a plurality of<br>
measuring tracks 8 which are disposed along a line perpendicular to the transport di-<br>
rection of the bank notes. The inductively operating magnetic sensor 10 recognizes as<br>
magnetic signals in each case temporal changes of magnetic properties in the recording<br><br>
area of the individual measuring tracks 8 of the magnetic sensor. When a security ele-<br>
ment 2 is transported past that is provided continuously with magnetic material and<br>
whose magnetic properties are constant along the security element, the particular<br>
measuring tracks 8 would detect magnetic signals only at the beginning and end of the<br>
security element 2. However, when a security element 2 is transported past that has<br>
one or more interruptions or gap areas in the magnetic material, additional magnetic<br>
signals arise at said interruptions or gap areas. The magnetic signals are transmitted by<br>
the magnetic sensor 10 to an evaluation device 9 which checks the authenticity and/or<br>
currency and/or denomination of the bank note 1.<br>
[0027] Figure 2 shows four exemplary embodiments of a bank note 1 made of paper<br>
or plastic which is provided with a security element 2 in the form of a strip extending<br>
across the total width of the bank note 1. The bank note 1 can of course have further<br>
security features, such as a watermark, steel gravure printing, security thread, lumines-<br>
cent prints, etc. The security element 2 is disposed on the bank note 1, e.g. printed on,<br>
affixed or incorporated in the bank note 1. Along the security element 2 there are dis-<br>
posed a plurality of magnetic areas 3a-e with magnetic material, and a plurality of gap<br>
areas 4a-d which either have no magnetic material or have a lower remanent flux den-<br>
sity than the magnetic areas 3a-e. This can be obtained e.g. by a corresponding choice<br>
of the layer thicknesses of the areas 3a-e, 4a-d and/or by a corresponding choice of the<br>
concentrations and/or width of the magnetic materials in the areas 3a-e, 4a-d and/or a<br>
corresponding choice of the materials in the areas 3a-e, 4a-d. In the shown examples,<br>
the magnetic areas 3a-e are disposed in the edge area of the security element 2 (the<br>
upper one in Figure 2) and form an (upper) edge track parallel to the longitudinal di-<br>
rection of the security element 2. Furthermore, the shown security element 2 has fur-<br>
ther magnetic areas which are disposed parallel to the magnetic areas 3a-e and form a<br>
second (lower) edge track. Between the two edge tracks, which are in each case e.g.<br>
0.2 to 0.4 mm wide, the security element 2 can additionally have identifying elements<br>
(not shown). By disposing two edge tracks with magnetic areas in or on the security<br>
element it is possible to realize a security element 2 which can both be provided with<br>
identifying elements and provide sufficient magnetic signal.<br><br>
[0028] In the example of Figure 2a, the security element 2 has only one gap area 4a<br>
and two magnetic areas 3a-b along its longitudinal direction. However, the security<br>
element 2 can also be equipped with a plurality of gap areas and a corresponding plu-<br>
rality of magnetic areas along the security element, as shown by the examples of Fig-<br>
ure 2b with two gap areas 4a-b and three magnetic areas 3a-c, of Figure 2c with three<br>
gap areas 4a-c and four magnetic areas 3a-d, and of Figure 2d with four gap areas 4a-d<br>
and five magnetic areas 3a-e. In said examples there are few, relatively short gap areas<br>
disposed along the otherwise magnetic edge tracks of the security element. Alterna-<br>
tively, the magnetic areas and gap areas can also be disposed along the edge tracks<br>
conversely, so to speak as the negative image of the arrangements from Figures 2a-d.<br>
In said examples there would then be few, relatively short magnetic areas disposed<br>
along the security element edge tracks otherwise provided with gap areas.<br>
[0029] In Figure 3a is an embodiment of a bank note 1 having a security element 2<br>
which has two magnetic areas 3a, 3b and one gap area 4a along its longitudinal direc-<br>
tion. The security element 2 is partially embedded in the substrate of the bank note 1,<br>
so that the security element 2, which is e.g. a windowed security thread, is visible only<br>
in windows 7. The security element 2 can also be embedded completely in the sub-<br>
strate of the bank note 1. In both cases magnetic signals can be detected.<br>
[0030] With reference to Figures 3b-c some preferred embodiments will be ex-<br>
plained more closely, which show the bank note 1 in cross section along the dot-<br>
dashed line A-A to make the structure of the security element 2 clear. According to<br>
Figure 3b, there is incorporated in or applied to the paper substrate or plastic substrate<br>
of the bank note 1 a security element 2 having magnetic areas 3a, 3b and a gap area 4a.<br>
[0031] In the figures of the present application the inventive security element 2 is<br>
shown only schematically. What is essential to the inventive security element 2 is the<br>
number, arrangement and length of the magnetic areas and gap areas along the security<br>
element 2. To show the magnetic areas and gap areas of the inventive security element<br>
2 more clearly, the figures hence omit the representation of further layers of the inven-<br>
tive security element 2. The actual realization of the layer structure can be effected<br>
according to the production methods known from the prior art. Thus, it is known e.g.<br><br>
from WO 92/11142 A1 to construct a security thread from a plurality of layers. It is<br>
possible at the same time to apply e.g. bars of magnetic material to a metal layer, cf.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 of said publication. The magnetic material can also be disposed within<br>
the layer structure, cf. the cross sections through the security threads of Figures 7 and<br>
8 of said publication, which have two edge tracks with magnetic material parallel to<br>
the longitudinal direction of the security thread. The layer structure of the inventive<br>
security element 2 can be realized e.g. in the manner described in WO 92/11142 Al.<br>
[0032] In certain embodiments, e.g. security elements that are exposed to high me-<br>
chanical or chemical load during use, it is expedient to cover the magnetic areas and<br>
gap areas 3a, 3b, 4a with a protective layer 6. The protective layer 6 may be a film<br>
laminated over the security element 2, or a protective lacquer layer. The protective<br>
lacquer layer can be applied all over or in partial areas. For this purpose there can be<br>
used e.g. UV lacquers, hybrid lacquers, oleographic lacquers or dispersion lacquers of<br>
the one- or two-component type. The protective lacquer layer is preferably printed on,<br>
e.g. by flexographic printing or offset printing.<br>
[0033] The security element 2 can also be disposed on a plastic film 5 which can be<br>
applied to the bank note 1 or be incorporated in the bank note 1, cf. Figure 3c. The<br>
plastic film 5 with a layer comprising magnetic areas 3a, 3b and a gap area 4a disposed<br>
thereon can be affixed to the bank note 1, for example. For protection of the layer<br>
comprising magnetic areas 3 a, 3b and gap areas 4a, the latter can be covered with a<br>
protective layer 6. Departing therefrom, there can be applied in and/or on the plastic<br>
film 5 a layer comprising magnetic areas 3 a, 3b and gap areas 4a to which an adhesive<br>
layer (not shown) is finally applied for fastening the security element 2 to the bank<br>
note 1. In this case, an additional protective layer can be omitted, because the plastic<br>
film 5 forms a protective cover for the security element. In comparison to the represen-<br>
tation in Figure 3c this results in a reverse order of the security element 2 and the plas-<br>
tic film 5.<br>
[0034] In all above-described cases the adhesive can also be applied to the bank<br>
note 1, rather than to the security element 2, for fastening the security element 2 to the<br>
banknote 1.<br><br>
[0035] The security element 2 can also be configured as a so-called planchet which<br>
is preferably incorporated on the surface of the bank-note substrate.<br>
[0036] As described above, the security element 2 can be produced directly on the<br>
bank note 1 or be made available as a separate security element 2 and fastened to the<br>
bank note 1. However, it can also be envisaged to provide a separate security element<br>
2 whose construction is only completed, e.g. provided with a protective layer, after the<br>
security element 2 has been fastened to the bank note 1.<br>
[0037] When the bank note 1 or the security element 2 is transported past a mag-<br>
netic sensor 10, there arises upon each change in the magnetic field of the security<br>
element 2 a measuring signal which can be evaluated by an evaluation device 9, for<br>
example a microcomputer, to permit statements to be made e.g. about the authenticity<br>
and/or the type of bank note, cf. Figure 1.<br>
[0038] In a security element 2 having a plurality of magnetic areas 3a-e and a plu-<br>
rality of gap areas 4a-d along a given direction, as described above, there exists - upon<br>
corresponding premagnetization of the security element 2 - a steplike change in mag-<br>
netization, i.e. a magnetization step, at each transition between a magnetic area and a<br>
gap area. When the security element 2 is transported past the magnetic sensor 10 there<br>
arises for each magnetization step a pulse in the measuring signal of at least one mag-<br>
netic track 8 of the magnetic sensor 10. Hence, the detected measuring signal shows<br>
not only pulses at the beginning and at the end of the passing security element 2, but,<br>
in addition, pulses upon passing of the places in the security element 2 where the mag-<br>
netic areas 3a-e and the gap areas 4a-d border on each other.<br>
[0039] In the case of a magnetization step representing a steplike drop in magnetiza-<br>
tion at the time t=tl - as is present e.g. in the case shown in Figure 4a between a mag-<br>
netic area 3a and a gap area 4 - there arises at the time t=tl in the measuring signal S1<br>
of the magnetic sensor 10 a first pulse which has the shape sketched in Figure 4a. In<br>
the converse case of a steplike increase in magnetization - as is present e.g. between a<br>
gap area 4 and a magnetic area 3b, cf. Figure 4b - there arises at the time t=t2 in the<br>
measuring signal S2 of the magnetic sensor 10 a second pulse with the form sketched<br>
in Figure 4b, which is approximately point-symmetric to the shape of the first pulse.<br><br>
When a security element 2 is transported past that has both a steplike drop and a<br>
steplike increase in magnetization at a suitable distance apart - as is shown e.g. in Figure 4c<br>
with the areas 3a, b and 4a - there arises at the magnetic sensor 10 approximately<br>
a measuring signal S3 which results from the sum of the measuring signals SI<br>
and S2. The extension of the gap area 4a along the transport direction of the security<br>
element 2 is advantageously so chosen that the measuring signals S1 and S2 of the two<br>
magnetization steps interfere constructively with each other. At the time t=t3 there<br>
arises in the case of the constructive interference a pulse with a clearly higher maxi-<br>
mum amplitude than the maximum amplitudes of the individual pulses of the measur-<br>
ing signals SI and S2.<br>
[0040] For a constructive interference of the magnetic signals SI and S2 it is neces-<br>
sary that the first and second pulses at least partly overlap in time. Furthermore, it is<br>
necessary that the instantaneous amplitudes of the two pulses in this time overlap area<br>
add up to a higher instantaneous total amplitude in comparison to the instantaneous<br>
amplitudes of the individual pulses. These conditions are satisfied for example by the<br>
magnetic signals of Figures 4a-c.<br>
[0041] The distance between the magnetization steps necessary for a constructive<br>
interference, or the extension of the gap area or magnetic area whose magnetization<br>
steps are to cause constructively interfering magnetic signals, depends crucially on the<br>
temporal width of the individual pulses, in particular on the relative temporal position<br>
of the maxima of the first and second pulses. This can be subject to several influence<br>
variables. Generally, the temporal width of the individual pulses depends on the opera-<br>
tion mode, e.g. inductive or magnetoresistive, and the geometry of the magnetic sensor<br>
used. In the case of the inductively operating magnetic sensor 10, the shape of the<br>
magnetic signal is influenced e.g. by the spatial extension of the recording area of the<br>
magnetic sensor 10. Both the arrangement and the extension of pole shoes by which<br>
the inductive magnetic sensor 10 operates play a part here. Furthermore, the shape of<br>
the magnetic signal also depends on the distance (chosen perpendicular to the transport<br>
direction) between the passing security element 2 or value document 1 and the mag-<br>
netic sensor 10. The ideal distance between the magnetization steps in order for a con-<br>
structive interference of the magnetic signals to comes about thus depends on the par-<br><br>
ticular realization of the magnetic-signal measurement and must be determined experimentally<br>
in particular cases. In the shown example of the inductive magnetic sensor<br>
10, said ideal distance is about 3 mm.<br><br>
