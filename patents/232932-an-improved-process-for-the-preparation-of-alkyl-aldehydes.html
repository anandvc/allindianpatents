				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of alkyl aldehydes. More particularly it relates to a process using formaldehyde and alkene in presence of organic soluble transition metal complex catalyst. The reaction comprises of two phases viz organic phase and aqueous phase. The organic phase contains olefin, either in pure form or a solution in organic solvent and water insoluble metal complex catalyst comprising of group VIII element such as Rh, Ru, Ir or Co. The aqueous phase contains 3 0% formaldehyde.<br><br>
In the prior art, the aldehydes products formed have a variety of applications in industries as solvents, plasticizers, detergent chemicals, fragrance chemicals, intermediates, pharmaceuticals etc. The aldehydes are generally manufactured by oxo technology (B. Cornils in "New synthesis with carbon monoxide" edited by J. Falbe, Springer Verley, New York (1980)) or by catalytic dehydrogenation of primary alcohol at high temperatures in presence of Cu or Cu-chromite catalysts and also by reduction of the acyl halides on Palladium on Barium sulfate support (Rosenmund reaction) (David Miller in Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology Vol. 1, page 932, John Wiley &amp; Sons,   New  York   (1991)).<br>
Oxo technology for the manufacture of aldehydes<br>
using homogeneous catalysts are well known in which the<br>
addition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to an olefin<br>
in the presence of metal complex catalyst soluble in<br>
the reaction medium is involved. This leads to risk<br>
associated with the handling of poisonous and explosive<br>
gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Whereas<br>
all other processes give poor yields as compared with<br>
the oxo process. In this invention, we propose the use<br>
of simple C1 molecule such as formaldehyde instead of<br>
gaseous reactants such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen<br>
used   in   conventional   oxo   technology.	This   reduces<br>
the risks associated with frandling of poisonous and explosive gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen required  in  the  conventional  oxo  process.<br>
The object of the present invention, therefore is to prepare the aldehydes using alkene and formaldehyde in presence of transition metal complex catalyst and also to avoid use of synthesis gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which required in conventional     oxo     process   for  manufacture  of  aldehydes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of alkyl aldehydes which comprises mixing an alkene or its solution, with a transition metal complex catalyst in water immisible  solvent   such  as  aliphatic,   aromatic  hydrocar-<br>
bons, formaldehyde,optionally in the presence of an additional ligand such as herein described, at a temperature ranging between 60-150°C, under stirring for a period of 2 to 50 hours, cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature and separating the product in the reaction mixture by conventional methods like distillation  or  chromatography.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention the alkenes used contain carbon atoms in the range of 2-30 and may be selected from ethylene, propylene,   1-hexene,   1-octene,   1-dodecene  or  the   like.<br>
In another embodiment the alkene may contain function groups like aldehydes, ketones, acids, cyanides,   or  the   like.<br>
In yet another embodiment the water immiscible solvent may be from aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents like hexane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene, ortho, meta, or para xylene, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, or  higher  alcohols.<br>
In yet another embodiment the metal complex catalyst having general formula MAXBYCZ wherein M = Transition   element   in  group   VII   A   such   as   Rh,    Co,    Ir,<br>
or the like, A,B,C are ligands such as aromatic or aliphatic phosphines, pyridine, pyrolidine, isoquino-line or the like, and x,y,z are the numbers of respective ligands and x + y + z ==3 and x,y,z may be vary between  =&gt;0   = 
In a feature of the present invention the metal complex catalyst is prepared by process described by Evans et al (Evans D., Osborne J. and Wilkinson G. in J. Chem. Soc. A 3133 (1968)) using Rhodium trichloride and  triphenyl  phosphine.<br>
In another feature of the process of the present invention may be carried out in the presence or absence of an additional ligand. The additional ligand may be selected from aromatic or aliphatic phosphines,      pyridine,   pyrolidine,   isoquinoline.<br>
The process of the invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are illustrative only should not be considered to limit the scope  of   the   invention.<br>
EXAMPLE   1<br>
The   following   charge   consisting   of   aqueous   and<br>
organic   phases   was   introduced   in   300   cm3    autoclave<br>
equipped  with  magnetic   type   drive   for   agitation.	The<br>
organic phase consisted of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 460 mg (0.5 mmol)       in   60   cm3   toluene   alongwith      1.65   g       (6.3   mmol)<br>
of     triphenyl   phosphine.	To   this   solution   30   cm3   30%<br>
formaldehyde solution in water was. added. The auto<br>
clave was pressurised with ethylene gas at 250 psig<br>
pressure. The reaction mixture was stirred at 900 rpm<br>
at   100   °C   for   12   hrs.	The   reactor  was   cooled  below<br>
ambient temperature and discharged. The color of organic solution was dark brown and analysis of aqueous and organic phase showed exhaustion of formaldehyde and corresponding amount of propionaldehyde was detected. The reactants and products were confirmed and analysed by  GC  analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE   2<br>
The   following   charge   consisting   of   aqueous   and<br>
organic   phases   was   introduced   in   300   cm3   autoclave<br>
equipped  with  magnetic   type   drive   for   agitation.	The<br>
organic phase consisted of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 460 mg (0.5<br>
mmol) in 55 cm3 toluene alongwith 5 cm3 ( 0.014 mol)<br>
hexene and 1.65 g (6.3 mmol) of triphenyl phosphine .<br>
To this solution 30 cm3 30% formaldehyde solution in<br>
water was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
900   rpm  at   100   °C   for  24   hrs.	The   reactor  was   cooled<br>
below ambient temperature and discharged. The color of organic solution was dark brown and analysis of organic phase shows exhaustion of hexene and corresponding amount of normal and branched heptaldehydes was detected. The reactants and products were confirmed and analysed  by  GC   analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE   3<br>
The   following   charge   consisting   of   aqueous   and<br>
organic   phases   was   introduced   in   300   cm3   autoclave<br>
equipped  with  magnetic   type   drive   for   agitation.	The<br>
organic phase consisted of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 460 mg (0.5<br>
mmol) in 55 cm3 toluene alongwith 5 cm (0.047 mol)<br>
styrene and 1.56 g (6.3 mmol ) of triphenyl phosphine.<br>
To this solution 30 cm 30% formaldehyde solution in<br>
water was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
900   rpm  at   100   °C   for   24   hrs.	The   reactor  was   cooled<br>
below ambient temperature and discharged. The color of<br>
organic solution was dark brown and analysis of organ<br>
ic phase shows exhaustion of styrene and corresponding<br>
amount of 2 phenyl propionaldehyde and 3 phenyl propi-<br>
onaldehyde was detected. The reactants and products<br>
were   confirmed   and  analysed  by  GC   analysis.	Present<br>
