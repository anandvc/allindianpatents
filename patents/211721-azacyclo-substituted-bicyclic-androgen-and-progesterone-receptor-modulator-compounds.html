"AZACYCLO-SUBSTITUTED BICYCLIC ANDROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOUNDS"<br>
LIGAND PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED, of 10275 Science Center Drive, San Diego, California 92121, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to azacyclo-substituted bicyclic androgen and progesterone receptor modulator compounds.<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/150,987, filed August 27, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds that are modulators (i.e., agonists, partial agonists and antagonists) of androgen and progesterone receptors, and to methods for the making and use of such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IRs) form a class of structurally-related genetic regulators scientists have named "ligand dependent transcription factors" (R. M. Evans, Science, 240:889, 1988). Steroid receptors are a recognized subset of the IRs, including androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocoticoid receptor (MR). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the IR itself and a corresponding ligand, which has the ability to selectively bind to the IR in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
The natural hormones for steroid receptors have been known for a long time, such as<br>
te'stosterone for AR and progesterone for PR. A synthetic compound that binds to an IR and<br>
mimics the effect of the native hormone is referred to as an "agonist", while a compound that<br>
inhibits the effect of the native hormone is called an "antagonist". The term "modulators" refers<br>
to a group of compounds that have a spectrum of activities from agonist, partial agonist to	<br>
antagonist.<br>
Androgen and progesterone receptor modulators are known to play an important role in health of both men and women. For example, AR antagonists, such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide and casodex, are useful in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate. AR agonists, such as fluoxymesterone, are used in the treatment of hypogonadism. PR agonists, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, are used in birth control formulations in combination with the female hormone estrogen or a synthetic estrogen analogue. Further,<br><br>
antagonists of PR are potentially useful for contraception and in the treatment of chronic disorders,such as certain hormone dependent cancers of the breast, ovary and uterus. Due to increased life expectancies, development of tissue selective, safer, orally active AR and PR modulators are desirable to improve quality of life.<br>
A group of hydroquinoline derivatives was recently described as AR and PR modulators (e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,688,808, 5,688,810, 5,693,646, 5,693,647, 5,696,127, 5,696,130). This group of AR and PR modulators was developed by using cell-based high-throughput asays, termed contransfection assays. Amino- or hydroxy-trifluoromethylquinolones or coumarins have been described as fluorescent markers in biological systems. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,505,852 and E. R. Bissel et al., "Synthesis and Chemistry of 7-Amino-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin and Its Amino Acid and Peptide Derivatives", J. Org. Chem., 45:2283, 1980). Analogues of quinolone, oxindole, benzooxazinone derivatives have been described as cardiotonic agents. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,993,656; 4,415,572; 4,427,654; 4,710,507; 4,728,653; 4,933,336; 5,081,242.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The bresent invention is directed to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for modulating processes mediated by AR and PR. More particularly, the invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds and compositions that are high affinity, high specificity agonists, partial agonists (i.e., partial activators and/or tissue-specific activators) and antagonists for AR and PR. Also provided are methods of making such compounds and pharmaceutical composition, as well as critical intermediates used in their synthesis.<br>

The sequences of steps for several general schemes to synthesize the compounds of the<br>
present invention are shown below. In each of the Schemes the R groups (e.g., R1 , R2 , etc.)<br>
correspond to the specific substitution patterns noted in the Examples. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other functionalities disclosed herein at the indicated positions of compounds of formulas I through XXXIII also comprise potential substituents for the analogous positions on the structures within the Schemes.<br><br><br>
The above reaction sequence shows the general formulation of quinolinone compounds which are modulators of androgen and progesterone receptors. In the above reaction sequence, an aniline compound is converted to a quinolinone compound by a Knorr cyclization with an alpha-keto ester compound. The quinolinone may then be converted to various derivatives including but not limited to thioquinolinones, quinolines, alkylated quinolinones, and functionalized quinolinones. In the above scheme, R represents various aromatic substituents contained on the aniline compound known to those skilled in the art. The R group on the quinolinone compounds may be interconverted to various substituents including but not limited to nitro, amino, alkylamino, halogen, alkyl, aryl, dialkylamino, pyrrole, and oxazolidene groups by various chemical reactions known to those skilled in the art. The R' group represents various aromatic subsitutents known to those skilled in the art and may originate from any of the 3, 5, and 6 positions on the ring, and n may be from 0 to 3. The R' groups on the quinolinone compounds may also be interconverted to various substitutents by chemistry known to those skilled in the art to form derivative quinolinone compounds. Schemes I through VI below show various preferred embodiments of the current invention.<br><br><br>
Scheme I describes a method to prepare quinolinone compounds such as Structure 5, nitro-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 6, and amino-2-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 3 through modified Knorr reactions. Thermal condensation of a 4-aminoacetanilide (Structure 1) with a 3-ketoester, for example, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate in nitrobenzene affords a bis-amide such as Structure 2. When a bis-amide compound of Structure 2 is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 60-100 °C, aminoquinolinone compounds of Structure 3 are produced. An alternate process of preparing 6-aminoquinolinone compounds such as Structure 3 starts with a similar Knorr reaction. The synthesis begins with reaction of an aniline such as Structure 4 and a 3-ketoester in refluxing toluene followed by treatment of a Lewis acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid to produce a 2-quinolinone such as Structure 5. Classic nitration of the 2-quinolinone (e.g., Structure 5) selectively provides a 6-mtroquinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 6). Reduction of the nitroquinolinone such as Structure 6 under standard reduction conditions (e.g., metal catalyzed hydrogenation or tin chloride reduction) affords aminoquinolinone compounds such as Structure 3.<br><br><br>
Scheme II describes the N-substitution of the 6-amino-2-quinolinone such as Structure 3 and the conversion of Structure 3 to mercapto analogues. A two-step sequential reductive alkylation of the aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3) with an aldehyde or ketone or acid in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride affords compounds of Structure 7. Treatment of an amino-2-quinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 3) with an acylating agent, such as acetyl chloride or anhydride, in the presence of a base such as pyridine or triethylamine provides amides or sulfonamides compounds as shown in Structure 7. Treatment of quinolinones of Structure 7 with Lawesson's reagent provides a corresponding thioquinolinone compound of Structure 8. Treatment of compounds of Structure 7 with an alkylating agent such as alkyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydride in a polar solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran gives compounds of Structure 9. Direct alkylation of Structure 3 provides<br><br>
compounds of Structure 10. The mercapto analogues of Structures 12 and 13 are prepared through diazo intermediate of Structure 11.<br><br>
Scheme III describes an alternate method for the syntheses of 6-amino compounds of Structures 7, 20, 21 and 22. The process begins with a step-wise Knorr reaction, in which 4-Bromoaniline (Structure 14) and a 3-ketoester such as the trifluoroacetoacetate are heated in reflux in toluene provides an amide such as Structure 15 and heating in concentrated sulfuric acid affords 4-bromoquinolinone such as Structure 16. Treatment of quinolinones such as Structure 16 with 2-iodopropane, catalyzed by cesium fluoride in DMF afford alkoxyquinoline compounds such as Structure 17. Palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction between<br><br>
bromoquinolines such as Structure 17 and alkylamines gives compounds of Structures 18 and 19. Hydrolysis of the quinoline compounds (Structures 18 and 19) in acidic condition provide compounds of Structures 7 and 20. Compounds of Structures 21 and 22 are prepared in a similar fashion.<br><br>
Scheme IV shows additional alkylation strategies of 6-aminoquinolinone of Structure 3 to provide 6-oxazolidine-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 25), 6-cycloalkylamino-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 20) and compounds of Structures 7 and 27.<br>
The process of Scheme IV begins with reductive alkylation of an aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3), with a-hydroxyketones of Structure 23 in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to provide compounds of Structure 24. Formation of an oxazolidlne compound such as Structure 25 is carried out by treatment of an aminol compound such as Structure 24 with an aldehyde or its corresponding hydrate in the presence of an acid. Quinolinone compounds of Structure 20 are prepared by condensation of an aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3) and a diketone such as Structure 28 in the presence of a reducing agent.<br><br>
Compounds such as Structure 7 are prepared by alkylation of quinoline intermediate of Structure 26 derived from Structure 3 with an alkyl halide. Direct alkylation of Structure 3 with halides affords mixture compounds of Structures 7 and 27.<br><br>
Scheme V shows the preparation of substituted quinolinones of Structures 20a and 31 from anilines of Structure 28 or 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 3. The process begins with a Knorr cyclization of a meta- or ortho-substituted aniline (e.g., Structure 28) with a 3-ketoester to afford compounds of Structure 29.   Nitration of compounds such as Structure 29 followed by reduction of the nitro group affords predominantly 6-amino compounds of Structure 30. Alternately compounds of Structure 30 are also obtained by modification of 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 3. For example, bromination of compounds of Structure 3 with NBS provides a 7-bromo-2-quinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 30, where R3 = bromo). Quinolinone compounds as shown in Structures 20a and 31 are synthesized in a similar fashion as that described in Schemes II and IV from the substituted 6-amino-2-quinolinones of Structure 30.<br><br><br>
Scheme VI describes the side-chain modification of the 6-cycloamino-2-quinolinones of Structure 32, The process of Scheme VI starts with the reduction of an ester derivative of Structure 32 to give hydroxycomppunds of Structure 33. Conversion of compounds of Structure 33 to tosylated analogues followed by nucleophilic substitution affords compounds of Structure 34. Oxidation of compounds of Structure 33 provides the formyl derivatives of Structure 35. Addition of a nucleophile to compounds of Structure 35 gives secondary alcohol analogues of Structure 36. Further manipulation affords compounds of Structure 37.<br><br>
Scheme VII describes Knorr reactions of substituted anilines to produce functionalized quinolinone compounds. The process of Scheme VII starts with alkylation of an aniline<br><br>
compound such as Structure 38 with trifluoroacetaldehyde in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride followed by zinc reduction to provide an alkylated bis-amine compound such as Structure 39. A typical Knorr procedure converts the alkylated amine compound 39 and ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate to a quinolinone compound such as 40. Reductive alkylation of compounds of 40 provides a bis-alkylaminoquinolinone such as Structure 41. Treatment of compounds of Structure 41 with thiophenol affords 7-hydroxyquinolinone compounds such as<br><br>
Scheme VIII describes the synthesis of 6-alkylaminocoumarins, as demonstrated by Structure 45, from phenol through a similar route as that described in Schemes I and II. A mixture of a phenol compound and a 3-ketoester such as ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate are heated in refluxing toluene in the presence of TsOH to afford a coumarin compound e.g., Structure 43. Nitration of coumarin compounds (e.g., Structure 43) followed by hydrogenation give aminocoumarin compounds such as Structure 44. Sequential reductive alkylation provides dialkylamino-coumarin compounds as shown in Structure 45. Hydrogenation of a dialkylamino-coumarin compound (e.g., Structure 45) affords compounds Structure 46.<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, the syntheses of benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 49) and derivatives thereof (e.g., Structures 51 and 52) are shown in Scheme IX.<br>
The process of Scheme IX begins with the treatment of an alkenylaniline compound such as Structure 47 with chloroformate in the presence of DMAP in THF to produce carbamates such as Structure 48. Benzoxazinone compounds such as Structure 49 (W=O) are produced by p-tolylsulfonic acid catalyzed intra-molecular cyclization of a carbamate (e.g., Structure 48).<br>
An alternate synthesis of benzo-oxazinone compounds of Structure 49 is also shown in Scheme IX. In this synthetic route, carbon nucleophiles are added to 2-aminobenzoic acid to give the amino-alcohol compound 50, which is converted to an aminobenzo-oxazinone compound such as Structure 49 by either l,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in THF or the carbonate-cyclization route as described above. A classic nitration reaction of the aromatic benzoxazinone compound by nitric acid in concentrate sulfuric acid followed by palladium catalyzed hydrogenation produces amino compounds such as Structure 51. A two-step sequential reductive alkylation as described previously produces dialkylamine-benzoxazinone compounds as shown in Structure 52.<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, bioisosteres of 6-amino-2-quinolinones such as 5-amino-oxinole, 6-amino-benzoxazinone and quinoline compounds, which are useful AR and PR modulators, are prepared from a corresponding bicyclic compound. The bicyclic compounds such as Structures 53, 56 and 58 are prepared by synthetic methods known to those skilled in the  art.<br>
Scheme X describes a synthetic process for preparing 5-bisalkylamino-oxindole compounds such as Structure 55 and 6-bisalkylated compounds of Structures 57 and 59. The method for preparing these compounds is described in Scheme IX and is analogous to the preparation of compounds such as Structure 52 from the corresponding quinolinone compound. The process involves sequential nitration, reduction and/or alkylation of the amine to produce compounds of Structures 55, 57 and 59.<br><br><br>
Scheme XI describes a preferred synthetic method to prepare 7-alkylamino-2-quinolinones such as Structure 63 via the Knorr reaction as previously described. The process of Scheme XI begins with a modified Knorr cyclization of 1,3-phenylenediamines of Structure 60 to give a 7-aminoquinolinone compound such as Structure 61. A sequential reductive alkylation of Structure 61 in a similar process as that described in Scheme II affords compounds such as Structure 62. Alkylation of quinolinone such as 62 with alkyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydride generates 1-alkyl quinolinone compounds such as Structure 63.<br><br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, alkylamino-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 66) are prepared from a corresponding amino-quinolinone compound. Schemes XII, XIII and XIV describe the methods of introducing a quaternary carbon next to the amino position.<br>
The process of Scheme XII begins with the treatment of a 7-aminoquinolinone such as Structure 61a with acetic acid in acetone to afford an alkyl amino-quinolinone compound such as Structure 64. Methyllithium addition to a compound such as Structure 64 in THF provides the corresponding alcohol adduct e.g., Structure 65. An acid catalyzed dehydration of an amino alcohol compound such as 65 gives an alkene amino-quinolinone compound such as 66.<br><br>
In another preferred reaction sequence, alkyl-quinolinones are produced by a Knorr cyclization of a diamine compound as previously described. Subsequent alkylation and oxidation produces alkyl-quinolinone compounds. The alkylamine-quinolinones may then be<br><br>
further converted to various derivative compounds by reactions known to those skilled in the art as exemplified in the examples below.<br>
Scheme XIII describes an alternate procedure to synthesize 2-quinolinones with a quaternary carbon adjacent to the 7-nitrogen. The process of Scheme XIII begins with a typical Knorr cyclization of a 1,3-phenylenediamine with a α-ketoester, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate, to afford an aminoquinoline compound such as 67 as a minor product. Alkylation of an aminoquinoline compound such as 67 with an amide such as N-phenyl-α-bromoisobutyramide in the presence of sodium hydride affords an alkylated quinoline product such as 68 in good yield. Hydrolysis of an alkylated quinoline compound (e.g., Structure 68) with HI provides a 2-quinolinone such as 69. Methylation of an alkylated quinoline compound such as 68 with iodomethane in the presence of sodium hydride followed by HI mediated hydrolysis produces a quinolinone such as Structure 70. Reduction of an amide compound such .  as 70 with DIBAL-H affords an aldehyde compound such as 71 and an alcohol product such as . 72. Wittig reaction of aldehydes such as 71 affords olefins such as Structure 73. Hydrogenation of an allylamino-quinolinone compound such as Structure 73 produces a corresponding alkylamino-quinolinone compound as shown in Structure 74.<br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, alkylamino-quinolinone compounds are produced by copper chloride catalyzed substitution of an amino-quinolinone compound. Scheme XIV describes an alternate N-alkylation method for the preparation of alkylamino-quinolinone compounds. Treatment of an amino quinolinone compound such as 61a and propargyl acetate<br><br>
with copper chloride and a base such as triethylamine in THF affords alkylamine-quinolinone products such as 75. Hydrogenation of an amino-acetylene compound such as 75 provides an alkylamino quinolinone compound as shown in Structure 76 in excellent yield.<br><br>
Alkyl-diamino compounds (e.g. Structure 78) are produced by two alternate synthetic methods in another preferred synthetic route as shown in Scheme XV. Alkylations of amino compounds as shown below are reactions known to those skilled in the art. The reaction as shown below is as an example of the preparation of these types of compounds.<br>
The process of Scheme XV begins with alkylation of a mono-protected 1,3-phenylenediamine followed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) mediated de-protection to produce diamino compounds such as Structure 78. Alternately, alkylation of a 3-nitroaniline followed by a reduction of the nitro group generates the same intermediates of Structure 78. Knorr cyclization as previously described in the presence of a a-keto-ester such as ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate affords compounds such as Structure 79 in good yield.<br><br><br>
Substituted diamino compounds are produced in another preferred embodiment of the invention. The diamino compounds are then further reacted to produce quinolinone compounds via the Knorr reaction as previously described. Scheme XVI describes a synthetic process for producing alkoxy-alkylamino-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 84.<br>
The process starts with substitution of a bis-nitrofluorobenzene with 2,2,2-trifluoroethyanol in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride to provide an alkoxy-nitrobenzene compound such as Structure 81. Conversion of bis-nitro groups to bis-amino groups is accomplished by hydrogenation or metal reduction to give aniline compounds such as Structure 82, A standard Knorr reaction with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate and p-tolylsufonic acid affords alkoxy-quinolinones such as Structure 83 in high yield. An alkoxy-amino-quinolinone compound such as 83 may subsequently be alkylated as previously described. For example, reductive alkylation of a compound such as Structure 83 with an aldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride gives alkoxy-alkylamino-quinolinone compounds as shown in Structure 84.<br><br><br>
In another preferred reaction, substituted diamine compounds (e.g., Structure 87) are produced by electrophilic aromatic substitution of activated aromatic amino-benzene rings. The substituted diamine compounds are then further reacted to produce quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 88) and subsequent quinolinone derivatives thereof (e.g., Structure 89) as previously described. Quinolinone compounds as shown in Scheme XVII are useful PR and AR modulators as described herein.<br>
Scheme XVII describes processes to synthesize substituted alkylaminoquinolinone compounds such as 89. Treatment of ortho-substituted aniline such as Structure 85 or a 4-substituted aniline such as 90 with nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid generates meta-nitrated products such as 86 or 91 in high yield. Hydrogenation of the nitro group on compounds such as 86 or 91 provides the Knorr precursors as shown as Structure 87. Treatment of 1,3-phenylenediamines such as 87 with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate in refluxing toluene in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid, such as p-tolylsufonic acid, affords quinolinone<br><br>
compounds as shown in Structure 88. Additional alkylation at the 7-amino group provides more functionalized compounds such as Structure 89 as previously described.<br><br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, functionalized quinolinones or functionalized dihydro-quinolinones are prepred from the corresponding substituted diamino-benzene compound (e.g. Structure 92). The amino portion of the quinolinone and dihydro-quinolinone compounds (e.g. Structures 94 and 93), may then be converted to other functional groups by chemical reactions known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such conversions are demonstrated in Scheme XVIII, forexample in the preparation of compounds such as 95, 96, 97 and 100.<br><br>
Scheme XVIII above describes methods of preparing functionalized quinolinones. The process of Scheme XVIII begins with modified Knorr reactions of diamine 92 with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate. In the p-tolylsufonic acid catalyzed refluxing toluene condition quinolinone compounds such as 94 are major products. In an alternate synthesis, the reaction is carried out in refluxing ethanol, which produces compounds such as Structure 93 as major products. Compounds such as 93 may then be converted to quinolinones such as 94 by acid catalyzed dehydration. The 5-amino group of compounds 93 or 94 is converted to 5-hydroxy derivatives of Structure 95 by diazotization-hydrolysis conditions using sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid. A similar condition by sodium nitrite and chloride converts the 5-amino to 5-chloro derivatives of Structure 98. Reductive alkylation of compounds of Structures 94 and 99 affords compounds of Structures 96 and 100.<br><br>
Another synthetic route into functionalized quinolinone compounds (e.g. Structures 102 and 104) is shown in Scheme XIX. Scheme XIX describes the synthesis of substituted quinolinone compounds such as Structures 102 and 104 under similar Knorr reaction conditions as that described in Scheme I. The Knorr reaction may also be used on substituted aniline compounds (e.g. Structure 101) to produce functionalized quinolinone compounds such as Structure 102. The functionalized quinolinone compounds as shown above may then be converted to other functional groups to produce additional quinolinone derivatives such as compounds of Structure 104 as described herein.<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the invention, halogenated quinolinones, benzo-oxazinones, indolones, benzothiozolones, and quinazolinones (i.e., arylhalogen compounds) produce alkylated derivatives by a C-C coupling of the arylhalogen carbon and a ketone with a lithium reagent. The above reaction sequence depicts the conversion of arylhalogen compounds to arylalkyl compounds by reaction of the aryl halide compound with a ketone. Schemes XX through XXIX depict further examples of this type of functional group conversion and are provided to further illustrate the reaction with various ketones and aryl compounds.<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the invention, functionalized quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 105 and 109) are produced by a C-C coupling of a halo-quinolinone such as Structure 16a and a ketone as shown in Schemes XX and XXI. The halo-quinolinone may be produced by either of two synthetic routes as shown below in Scheme XX. Scheme XX describes the synthesis of a number of functionalized quinolinone compounds.<br>
3-FIuorinated-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 16a may be formed by treatment of a 3-ketoamide 15 with a fluorination reagent, such as fluorobenzenesulfonimide, to provide a fluorinated derivative product such as Structure 15a, which is converted to the 3-fluoro quinoiinone compound 16a (R = fluorine) by the Knorr cyclization with concentrated sulfuric acid.<br><br>
A 7-methoxy analogue of Structure 16a is prepared by NBS bromination of quinolinone 29a. Addition of a dianion generated from a bromo-quinolinone such as 16a by two equivalents of base, such as alkyllithium, to a ketone affords the tertiary alcohols as shown in Structure 105. Dehydration of an alcohol sucfi as 105 with a catalytic amount of acid, such as sulfuric acid, gives olefins of Structure 106. Subsequent hydrogenation of olefins such as 106 provides an alkyl-quinolinone such as Structure 107. A thioquinolinone derivative may be synthesized by treatment of compounds 107 with Lawesson's reagent in toluene as previously described.<br><br>
Scheme XXI describes a process of preparing alkenyl-quinolinone compounds. Addition of the dianion generated from a bromoquinolinone such as 16b by methyllithium and n-butyllithium to a protected cyclic 1,3-diketone affords oxo-alkenyl-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 109 upon acid mediated hydrolysis of the adducts. Reduction of the oxo group on a compound such as 109 with DIBAH provides the alcohol derivative as shown in Structure 110.<br><br><br>
A further example of the conversion of arylhalogen compounds (e.g. Structure 16) to arylalkyl compounds is shown in Scheme XXII. Scheme XXII describes the preparation of additional 6-alkyl 2-quinolinone compounds from the quinolinone dianion in a preferred aspect of the invention. Addition of a dianion generated from a bromo quinolinone, methyllithium and n-butyllithium to benzophenone gives an alkyl quinolinone such as compound 111. Reduction of compound 111 with triethylsilane in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as TFA, affords an alkyl-quinolinone compound such as 112.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, aryl halogen compounds are converted to aryl alkynes by a palladium catalyzed coupling reaction between the aryl halogen (e.g., Structure 16) and a terminal alkyne as shown above in Scheme XXII. For example, a palladium(II) catalyzed reaction of a bromoquinolinone such as 16 and a terminal alkyne such as dimethyl propargyl alcohol provides an alkynyl-quinolinone compound such as 113.<br><br><br>
A method of converting arylhalides to arylalkyl compounds is also employed with benzo-oxazinone compounds as shown in the above example. Scheme XXIII describes methods of synthesizing alkyl l,3-benzo[d]oxazin-2-one compounds.<br>
The process of Scheme XXIII begins with a bromination of a compound such as 49a with bromine to give a bromobenzo-oxazinone compound such as 114. Addition of the dianion generated from the lithiation of a compound such as 49a to a ketone provides the hydroxy-alkyl adducts of Structure 115. Dehydration of alcohol derivative 115 with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid affords compounds such as Structure 116, which may be hydrogenated to give compounds such as Structure 118. Benzothiooxazinone compounds as shown in Structure 117   are prepared from the corresponding carbonyl compound (e.g., such as Structure 116) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent as previously described.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXIV describes additional methods to prepare alkyl benzo-oxazinones. The process of Scheme XXIV begins with addition of the dianion generated from lithiation of compound 114 by alkyllithium to a protected 1,3-cyclodiketone. Hydrolysis of adducts with an acid affords alkene compounds Structure 119. Addition of n-butyllithium to an enone such as 119 provides a tertiary alcohol such as 122. Reduction of the enone 119 with DIBAL-H gives a   . secondary alcohol such as 120. Hydrogenation affords compound such as 121. Alkyl thio-benzo-oxazinone compounds are prepared by a similar process but using a thiobenzo-oxazinone such as 118a in place of the oxo compound.<br><br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, substituted benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 125) are prepared for an amino-benzoic acid and an organometallic reagent to form a hydroxy-aniline compound (e.g., Structure 124) with either a halide or carbonyl diimidazole to form a benzo-oxazinone. The process of Scheme XXV begins with addition of either alkyl lithium or a Grignard reagent to a 2-aminobenzoic acid such as Structure 123 to generate amino alcohol compound such as Structure 124. A previously described cyclization procedure-from either l,1'-carbonyldiimidazole treatment or acid catalyzed carbamate intermediate affords compounds such as Structure 125. Treatment of benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 125) with bromine provides brominated benzo-oxazinone compounds such as Structure 126. Addition of an anion generated from compounds such as 126 and an alkyl lithium reagent to a ketone such as cyclohexanone affords compounds such as Structure 127. The alkenyl-benzo-oxazinone compound (e.g., 127) may be hydrogenated to give alkyl compounds such as Structure 128.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXVI describes a process to introduce a trifluoromethyl group at the 4-position of benzo-oxazinone compounds. The process starts with addition of an N-protected 2-aminoaryl lithium generated by metal halogen exchange of 2-aminobromobenzene and n-butyllithium to ethyl trifluoroacetate followed by a reduction with sodium borohydride to provide compounds such as 129. Acid catalyzed cyclization of compounds such as 129 afford benzo-oxazinone compounds such as 130. The benzo-oxazinone compound may subsequently be treated with bromine to generate a bis-brominated product such as 131. As previously described, the bromine may be substituted with an alkyl group. For example, the 6-cyclohexenyl derivative 132 is prepared in a similar fashion as that described in Scheme XXV.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXVII describes methods to prepare alkyl oxindole derivatives by bromination  of the oxindole followed by substitution of the bromine group with an alkyl group as previously described. The process starts with alkylation of 2-indoIone with alkyl halides in the presence of n-butyllithium followed by selective bromination to afford brominated oxindole compounds (e.g., Structure 133). The alkyl-indolone compounds are prepared from a bromo compound such as 133 by a procedure similar to that as described in Scheme XXV.<br><br>
Scheme XXVIII describes a synthetic route of producing alkyl-benzothiozolones. The process is similar to that as described in Scheme XXV but using a halogenated benzothiozolone compound.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXIX describes a process to prepare 2-quinazolinones. The process of Scheme XXIX begins with bromination of compound 140 to afford compound 141, which is derivatized by treatment with benzyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride to give compound 142. A palladium catalyzed aromatic substitution of compounds of Structure 141 or 142 by Grignard reagents provides compounds of Structure 143.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXX describes an alternate method of preparing aryl-quinolinones by a modified Suzuki coupling reaction. The process starts with palladium catalyzed biaryl coupling of a bromo compound such as Structure 16c, a brominated quinolinone, with an aryl boronic acid (e.g., Structure 144). Aryl compounds such as Structure 145 are produced in this manner. The boronic acids of Structure 144 come from commercial sources or may be generated from aryl bromides by a standard three-step procedure which includes metal halogen exchange, addition to methyl borate and acidic work-up. Aryl substituted compounds of the present invention (e.g., Structure 145) may be further functionalized by modification of the substituents on the aryl group by standard synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. Alternately, aryl substituted compounds of the present invention such as Structure 145 may be prepared from the aryl aniline (e.g., 6-arylaniline, Structure 147) as shown above by a Knorr reaction procedure as previously described.<br><br>
Scheme XXXI describes additional methods to prepare 6-substituted 2-quinolinones such as Structures 149, 150, 152 and 153. Lithiation of Structure 17 followed by addition to a Weinreb's amide afford compounds of Structure 148. Hydrolysis of quinolines such as Structure<br><br>
148 provides compounds of Structure 149. Compounds of Structure 150 are obtained by reductive amination of compounds such as Structure 149. Addition of a nucleophile to quinoline ketones of Structure 148 generates alcohols of Structure 151, which are treated with acid to afford compounds of Structures 152 and 153.<br><br>
Scheme XXXII describes the conversion of 2-quinolinones of Structure 7 to 2-substituted quinolines such as Structures 154,155 and 156 by the chemical transformations known to those skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXXIII describes methods to prepare compounds with a diazo containing side chain. Treatment of 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 7a with NaNO2 affords compounds of Structure 157. Reduction of nitroso compounds such as Structure 157 followed by alkylation provide analogues of Structure 158. Alkylation or acylation of hydrazine such as Structure 159 generates compounds of Structures 160 and 161.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also include racemates, stereoisomers and mixtures of said compounds, including isotopically labeled and radio-labeled compounds. Such isomers can be isolated by standard resolution techniques, including fractional crystallization and chiral column chromatography.<br>
As noted above, any of the steroid modulator compounds of the present invention can be combined-in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to provide pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating the biological conditions or disorders noted herein in mammalian, and more preferably, in human patients. The particular carrier employed in these pharmaceutical compositions may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the type of administration desired, e.g., intravenous, oral, topical, suppository or parenteral.<br><br>
In preparing the compositions in oral liquid dosage forms (e.g., suspensions, elixirs and solutions), typical pharmaceutical media, such as water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be employed. Similarly, when preparing oral solid dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets and capsules), carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like will be employed. Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage form for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
For parenteral administration, the carrier will typically comprise sterile water, although other ingredients that aid in solubility or serve as preservatives, may also be included. Furthermore, injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like will be employed.<br>
For topical administration, the compounds of the present invention may be formulated using bland, moisturizing bases, such as ointments or creams. Examples of suitable ointment bases are petrolatum, petrolatum plus volatile silicones, lanolin, and water in oil emulsions such as Eucerin™ (Beiersdorf). Examples of suitable cream bases are Nivea™ Cream (Beiersdorf), cold cream (USP), Purpose Cream™ (Johnson &amp; Johnson), hydrophilic ointment (USP), and Lubriderm™ (Warner-Lambert).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and compounds of the present invention will generally be administered in the form of a dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule etc.) at from about 1 p.g/kg of body weight to about 500 mg/kg of body weight, more preferably from about 10 u,g/kg to about 100 mg/kg, and most preferably from about 20 ug/kg to about 20 mg/kg. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the particular quantity of pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention administered to a patient will depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the biological activity desired, the condition of the patient, and tolerance for the drug.<br>
The compounds of this invention also have utility when radio- or isotopically-labeled as ligands for use in assays to determine the presence of AR or PR in a cell background or extract. They are particularly useful due to their ability to selectively activate androgen receptors or progesterone receptors, and can therefore be used to determine the presence of such receptors in the presence of other steroid receptors or related intracellular receptors.<br><br>
Due to the selective specificity of the compounds of this invention for steroid receptors, these compounds can be used to purify samples of steroid receptors in vitro. Such purification can be carried out by mixing samples containing steroid receptors with one or more of the compounds of the present invention so that the compounds bind to the receptors of choice, and then separating out the bound ligand/receptor combination by separation techniques which are known to those of skill in the art. These techniques include column separation, filtration, centrifugation, tagging and physical separation, and antibody complexing, among others.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can advantageously be used in the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein. In this regard, the compounds and compositions of the present invention will prove particularly useful as modulators of male sex steroid-dependent diseases and conditions such as the treatment of acne, male-pattern baldness, male hormone replacement therapy, wasting diseases, hirsutism, stimulation of hematopoiesis, hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia, osteoporosis (agonist), male contraception (agonist), impotence (agonist), cancer cachexia (agonist) various hormone-dependent cancers, including, without limitation, prostate and breast cancer and as anabolic agents.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention possess a number of advantages over previously identified steroidal and non-steroidal compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention possess a number of advantages over previously identified steroid modulator compounds. For example, the compounds are extremely potent activators of AR, preferably displaying 50% maximal activation of AR at a concentration of less than 100 nM, more preferably at a concentration of less than 50 nM, more preferably yet at a concentration of less than 20 nM, and most preferably at a concentration of 10 nM or less. Also, the selective compounds of the present invention generally do not display undesired cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors, as is seen with the compound mifepristone (RU486; Roussel Uclaf), a known PR antagonist that displays an undesirable cross reactivity on GR and AR, thereby limiting its use in long-term, chronic administration. In addition, the compounds of the present invention, as small organic molecules, are easier to synthesize, provide greater stability and can be more easily administered in oral dosage forms than other known steroidal compounds.<br><br>
The invention will be further illustrated by reference to the following non-limiting Examples.<br>

10     Steroid Receptor Activity<br>
Utilizing the "cis-trans" or "co-transfection" assay described by Evans et al., Science. 240:889-95 (May 13, 1988), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, the compounds of the present invention were tested and found to have strong, specific activity as both agonists, partial agonists and antagonists of AR. This assay is described in further detail in<br>
15      U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,784 and 5,071,773, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The co-transfection assay provides a method for identifying functional agonists and partial agonists which mimic, or antagonists which inhibit, the effect of native hormones, and quantifying their activity for responsive IR proteins. In this regard, the co-transfection assay<br>
20     mimics an in vivo system in the laboratory. Importantly, activity in the co-transfection assay correlates very well with known w vivo activity, such that the co-transfection assay functions as a qualitative and quantitative predictor of a tested compounds jn vivo pharmacology. See, e.g.. T. Berger et al. 41 J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol. 773 (1992), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
25	In the co-transfection assay, a cloned cDNA for an IR (e.g., human PR, AR or GR) under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter (e.g., the SV 40 promoter) is introduced by transfection (a procedure to induce cells to take up foreign genes) into a background cell substantially devoid of endogenous IRs. This introduced gene directs the recipient cells to make the IR protein of interest. A second gene is also introduced (co-transfected) into the same cells in conjunction<br>
30     with the IR gene. This second gene, comprising the cDNA for a reporter protein, such as firefly<br>
7Pc°<br><br>
luciferase (LUC), controlled by an appropriate hormone responsive promoter containing a hormone response element (HRE). This reporter plasmid functions as a reporter for the transcription-modulating activity of the target IR. Thus, the reporter acts as a surrogate for the products (mRNA then protein) normally expressed by a gene under control of the target receptor 5     and its native hormone.<br>
The co-transfection assay can detect small molecule agonists or antagonists of target IRs. Exposing the transfected cells to an agonist ligand compound increases reporter activity in the transfected cells. This activity can be conveniently measured, e.g., by increasing luciferase production, which reflects compound-dependent, IR-mediated increases in reporter transcription.<br>
10     To detect antagonists, the co-transfection assay is carried out in the presence of a constant<br>
concentration of an agonist to the target IR (e.g., progesterone for PR) known to induce a defined reporter signal. Increasing concentrations of a suspected antagonist will decrease the reporter signal (e.g., luciferase production). The co-transfection assay is therefore useful to detect both agonists and antagonists of specific IRs. Furthermore, it determines not only whether a<br>
15     compound interacts with a particular IR, but whether this interaction mimics (agonizes) or blocks<br>
«<br>
(antagonizes) the effects of the native regulatory molecules on target gene expression, as well as the specificity and strength of this interaction.<br>
The activity of selected steroid receptor modulator compounds of the present invention were evaluated utilizing the co-transfection assay, and in standard IR binding assays, according 20     to the following illustrative Examples.<br>

CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts) were cultured in the presence of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% charcoal resin-stripped 25     fetal bovine serum then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates one day prior to transfection.<br>
To determine AR agonist and antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention, the CV-1 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation according to the procedure of Berger et al., 41 J. Steroid Biochem.Mol. Biol, 733 (1992) with the following plasmids: pShAR (5 ng/well), MTV-LUC reporter (100 ng/well), pRS-B-Gal (50<br><br>
ng/well) and filler DNA (pGEM; 45 ng/well). The receptor plasmid, pRShAR, contains the human AR under constitutive control of the SV-40 promoter, as more fully described in J. A. Simental et al., "Transcriptional activation and nuclear targeting signals of the human androgen receptor", 266 J. Biol. Chem., 510 (1991).<br>
The reporter plasmid, MTV-LUC, contains the cDNA for firefly luciferase (LUC) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) long terminal repeat, a conditional promoter containing an androgen response element. See e.g, Berger et al. supra. In addition, pRS-B-Gal, coding for constitutive expression of E. coli B-galactosidase (B-Gal), was included as an internal control for evaluation of transfection efficiency and compound toxicity.<br>
Six hours after transfection, media was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Media containing reference compounds (i.e. progesterone as a PR agonist, mifepristone ((1 lbeta,17beta)-l l.-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17-hydroxy-17-(l-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one: RU486; Roussel Uclaf) as a PR antagonist; dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma Chemical) as an AR agonist and 2-OH-flutamide (the active metabolite of 2-methyl-N-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyI)phenyl]pronanamide; Schering-Plough) as an AR antagonist; estradiol (Sigma) as an ER agonist and ICI 164,384 (N-butyl-3,17-dihydroxy-N-methyl-(7-alpha,17-beta)-estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-7-undecanamide; ICI Americas) as an ER antagonist; dexamethasone (Sigma) as a GR agonist and RU486 as a GR antagonist; and aldosterone (Sigma) as a MR agonist and spironolactone ((7-alpha-[acetylthio]-17-alpha-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid gamma-lactone; Sigma) as an MR antagonist) and/or the modulator compounds of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10"'2 to 10-5 M were added to the cells. Three to four replicates were used for each sample. Transfections and subsequent procedures were performed on a Biomek 1000 automated laboratory work station.<br>
After 40 hours, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed with a Triton X-l 00-based buffer and assayed for LUC and B-Gal activities using a luminometer or spectrophotometer, respectively. For each replicate, the normalized response (NR) was calculated as:<br>
LUC response/B-Gal rate<br>
where B-Gal rate = B-Gal*lxl0-5/B-Gal incubation time.<br><br>
The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the NR were calculated. Data was plotted as the response of the compound compared to the reference compounds over the range of the dose-response curve. For agonist experiments, the effective concentration that produced 50% of the maximum response (EC50) was quantified. Agonist efficacy was a function (%) of LUC expression relative to the maximum LUC production by the reference agonist for PR, AR, ER, GR or MR, Antagonist activity was determined by testing the amount of LUC expression in the presence of a fixed amount of DHT as an AR agonist and progesterone as a PR agonist at the EC50 concentration. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of LUC expression induced by the reference agonist were quantified (IC50). In addition, the efficacy of antagonists was determined as a function (%) of maximal inhibition. IR Binding assay<br>
AR Binding: For the whole cell binding assay, COS-1 cells in 96-well microtiter plates containing DMEM-10% FBS were transfected as described above with the following plasmid DNA: pRShAR (2 ng/well), pRS-β-Gal (50 ng/well) and pGEM (48 ng/well). Six hours after transfection, media was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and fresh media was added. The next day, the media was changed to DMEM-serum free to remove any endogenous ligand that might be complexed with the receptor in the cells.<br>
After 24 hours in serum-free media, either a saturation analysis to determine the Kd for<br>
tritiated dihydrotestosterone (^H-DHT) on human AR or a competitive binding assay to evaluate the ability of test compounds to compete with ^H-DHT for AR was performed. For the saturation analysis, media (DMEM-0.2% CA-FBS) containing 3H-DHT (in concentrations ranging from 12 nM to 0.24 nM) in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT were added to the cells. For the competitive binding assay, media containing 1 nM ^H-DHT and test compounds in concentrations ranging from 10"10 to 10-6 M were added to the cells. Three replicates were used for each sample. After three hours at 37°C, an aliquot of the total binding media at each concentration of 3H-DHT was removed to estimate the amount of free 3H-DHT.   The remaining media was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound ligand, and cells were lysed with a Triton X-100-based buffer. The lysates were assayed for amount of<br><br>
bound 3H-DHT and β-Gal activity using a scintillation counter or spectrophotometer, respectively.<br>
For the saturation analyses, the difference between the total binding and the nonspecific binding, normalized by the B-Gal rate, was defined as specific binding. The specific binding was<br>
evaluated by Scatchard analysis to determine the Kd for 3H-DHT. See e.g., D. Rodbard, "Mathematics and statistics of Hgand assays: an illustrated guide" In: J. Langon and J.J. Clapp, eds., Ligand Assay, Masson Publishing U.S.A., Inc., New York, pp. 45-99, (1981), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. For the competition studies, the data was plotted as<br>
the amount of 3H-DHT (% of control in the absence of test compound) remaining over the range of the dose-response curve for a given compound. The concentration of test compound that inhibited:50% of the amount of 3H-DHT bound in the absence of competing ligand was quantified (IC50) after log-logit transformation. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 values, where:<br><br>
After correcting for non-specific binding, IC50 values were determined. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC50 value was determined graphically from a log-logit plot of the data. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equivuation to the IC50 "values, the labeled ligand concentration and the Kd of the labeled ligand.<br>
The agonist, antagonist and binding activity assay results of selected androgen receptor modulator compounds of present invention and the standard reference compounds on AR, as well as the cross-reactivity of selected compounds on the PR, ER, MR and GR receptors, are shown in Tables 1-2 below. Efficacy is reported as the percent maximal response observed for each compound relative to the reference agonist and antagonist compounds indicated above. Also reported in Tables 1-2 for each compound is its antagonist potency or IC50 (which is the concentration (nM), required to reduce the maximal response by 50%), its agonist potency or EC50 (nM).<br><br>

"AZACYCLO-SUBSTITUTED BICYCLIC ANDROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOUNDS"<br>
LIGAND PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED, of 10275 Science Center Drive, San Diego, California 92121, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to azacyclo-substituted bicyclic androgen and progesterone receptor modulator compounds.<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/150,987, filed August 27, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds that are modulators (i.e., agonists, partial agonists and antagonists) of androgen and progesterone receptors, and to methods for the making and use of such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IRs) form a class of structurally-related genetic regulators scientists have named "ligand dependent transcription factors" (R. M. Evans, Science, 240:889, 1988). Steroid receptors are a recognized subset of the IRs, including androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocoticoid receptor (MR). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the IR itself and a corresponding ligand, which has the ability to selectively bind to the IR in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
The natural hormones for steroid receptors have been known for a long time, such as<br>
te'stosterone for AR and progesterone for PR. A synthetic compound that binds to an IR and<br>
mimics the effect of the native hormone is referred to as an "agonist", while a compound that<br>
inhibits the effect of the native hormone is called an "antagonist". The term "modulators" refers<br>
to a group of compounds that have a spectrum of activities from agonist, partial agonist to	<br>
antagonist.<br>
Androgen and progesterone receptor modulators are known to play an important role in health of both men and women. For example, AR antagonists, such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide and casodex, are useful in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate. AR agonists, such as fluoxymesterone, are used in the treatment of hypogonadism. PR agonists, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, are used in birth control formulations in combination with the female hormone estrogen or a synthetic estrogen analogue. Further,<br><br>
antagonists of PR are potentially useful for contraception and in the treatment of chronic disorders,such as certain hormone dependent cancers of the breast, ovary and uterus. Due to increased life expectancies, development of tissue selective, safer, orally active AR and PR modulators are desirable to improve quality of life.<br>
A group of hydroquinoline derivatives was recently described as AR and PR modulators (e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,688,808, 5,688,810, 5,693,646, 5,693,647, 5,696,127, 5,696,130). This group of AR and PR modulators was developed by using cell-based high-throughput asays, termed contransfection assays. Amino- or hydroxy-trifluoromethylquinolones or coumarins have been described as fluorescent markers in biological systems. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,505,852 and E. R. Bissel et al., "Synthesis and Chemistry of 7-Amino-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin and Its Amino Acid and Peptide Derivatives", J. Org. Chem., 45:2283, 1980). Analogues of quinolone, oxindole, benzooxazinone derivatives have been described as cardiotonic agents. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,993,656; 4,415,572; 4,427,654; 4,710,507; 4,728,653; 4,933,336; 5,081,242.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The bresent invention is directed to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for modulating processes mediated by AR and PR. More particularly, the invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds and compositions that are high affinity, high specificity agonists, partial agonists (i.e., partial activators and/or tissue-specific activators) and antagonists for AR and PR. Also provided are methods of making such compounds and pharmaceutical composition, as well as critical intermediates used in their synthesis.<br>

The sequences of steps for several general schemes to synthesize the compounds of the<br>
present invention are shown below. In each of the Schemes the R groups (e.g., R1 , R2 , etc.)<br>
correspond to the specific substitution patterns noted in the Examples. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other functionalities disclosed herein at the indicated positions of compounds of formulas I through XXXIII also comprise potential substituents for the analogous positions on the structures within the Schemes.<br><br><br>
The above reaction sequence shows the general formulation of quinolinone compounds which are modulators of androgen and progesterone receptors. In the above reaction sequence, an aniline compound is converted to a quinolinone compound by a Knorr cyclization with an alpha-keto ester compound. The quinolinone may then be converted to various derivatives including but not limited to thioquinolinones, quinolines, alkylated quinolinones, and functionalized quinolinones. In the above scheme, R represents various aromatic substituents contained on the aniline compound known to those skilled in the art. The R group on the quinolinone compounds may be interconverted to various substituents including but not limited to nitro, amino, alkylamino, halogen, alkyl, aryl, dialkylamino, pyrrole, and oxazolidene groups by various chemical reactions known to those skilled in the art. The R' group represents various aromatic subsitutents known to those skilled in the art and may originate from any of the 3, 5, and 6 positions on the ring, and n may be from 0 to 3. The R' groups on the quinolinone compounds may also be interconverted to various substitutents by chemistry known to those skilled in the art to form derivative quinolinone compounds. Schemes I through VI below show various preferred embodiments of the current invention.<br><br><br>
Scheme I describes a method to prepare quinolinone compounds such as Structure 5, nitro-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 6, and amino-2-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 3 through modified Knorr reactions. Thermal condensation of a 4-aminoacetanilide (Structure 1) with a 3-ketoester, for example, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate in nitrobenzene affords a bis-amide such as Structure 2. When a bis-amide compound of Structure 2 is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 60-100 °C, aminoquinolinone compounds of Structure 3 are produced. An alternate process of preparing 6-aminoquinolinone compounds such as Structure 3 starts with a similar Knorr reaction. The synthesis begins with reaction of an aniline such as Structure 4 and a 3-ketoester in refluxing toluene followed by treatment of a Lewis acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid to produce a 2-quinolinone such as Structure 5. Classic nitration of the 2-quinolinone (e.g., Structure 5) selectively provides a 6-mtroquinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 6). Reduction of the nitroquinolinone such as Structure 6 under standard reduction conditions (e.g., metal catalyzed hydrogenation or tin chloride reduction) affords aminoquinolinone compounds such as Structure 3.<br><br><br>
Scheme II describes the N-substitution of the 6-amino-2-quinolinone such as Structure 3 and the conversion of Structure 3 to mercapto analogues. A two-step sequential reductive alkylation of the aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3) with an aldehyde or ketone or acid in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride affords compounds of Structure 7. Treatment of an amino-2-quinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 3) with an acylating agent, such as acetyl chloride or anhydride, in the presence of a base such as pyridine or triethylamine provides amides or sulfonamides compounds as shown in Structure 7. Treatment of quinolinones of Structure 7 with Lawesson's reagent provides a corresponding thioquinolinone compound of Structure 8. Treatment of compounds of Structure 7 with an alkylating agent such as alkyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydride in a polar solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran gives compounds of Structure 9. Direct alkylation of Structure 3 provides<br><br>
compounds of Structure 10. The mercapto analogues of Structures 12 and 13 are prepared through diazo intermediate of Structure 11.<br><br>
Scheme III describes an alternate method for the syntheses of 6-amino compounds of Structures 7, 20, 21 and 22. The process begins with a step-wise Knorr reaction, in which 4-Bromoaniline (Structure 14) and a 3-ketoester such as the trifluoroacetoacetate are heated in reflux in toluene provides an amide such as Structure 15 and heating in concentrated sulfuric acid affords 4-bromoquinolinone such as Structure 16. Treatment of quinolinones such as Structure 16 with 2-iodopropane, catalyzed by cesium fluoride in DMF afford alkoxyquinoline compounds such as Structure 17.

bromoquinolines such as Structure 17 and alkylamines gives compounds of Structures 18 and 19. Hydrolysis of the quinoline compounds (Structures 18 and 19) in acidic condition provide compounds of Structures 7 and 20. Compounds of Structures 21 and 22 are prepared in a similar fashion.<br><br>
Scheme IV shows additional alkylation strategies of 6-aminoquinolinone of Structure 3 to provide 6-oxazolidine-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 25), 6-cycloalkylamino-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 20) and compounds of Structures 7 and 27.<br>
The process of Scheme IV begins with reductive alkylation of an aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3), with a-hydroxyketones of Structure 23 in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to provide compounds of Structure 24. Formation of an oxazolidlne compound such as Structure 25 is carried out by treatment of an aminol compound such as Structure 24 with an aldehyde or its corresponding hydrate in the presence of an acid. Quinolinone compounds of Structure 20 are prepared by condensation of an aminoquinolinone (e.g., Structure 3) and a diketone such as Structure 28 in the presence of a reducing agent.<br><br>
Compounds such as Structure 7 are prepared by alkylation of quinoline intermediate of Structure 26 derived from Structure 3 with an alkyl halide. Direct alkylation of Structure 3 with halides affords mixture compounds of Structures 7 and 27.<br><br>
Scheme V shows the preparation of substituted quinolinones of Structures 20a and 31 from anilines of Structure 28 or 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 3. The process begins with a Knorr cyclization of a meta- or ortho-substituted aniline (e.g., Structure 28) with a 3-ketoester to afford compounds of Structure 29.   Nitration of compounds such as Structure 29 followed by reduction of the nitro group affords predominantly 6-amino compounds of Structure 30. Alternately compounds of Structure 30 are also obtained by modification of 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 3. For example, bromination of compounds of Structure 3 with NBS provides a 7-bromo-2-quinolinone compound (e.g., Structure 30, where R3 = bromo). Quinolinone compounds as shown in Structures 20a and 31 are synthesized in a similar fashion as that described in Schemes II and IV from the substituted 6-amino-2-quinolinones of Structure 30.<br><br><br>
Scheme VI describes the side-chain modification of the 6-cycloamino-2-quinolinones of Structure 32, The process of Scheme VI starts with the reduction of an ester derivative of Structure 32 to give hydroxycomppunds of Structure 33. Conversion of compounds of Structure 33 to tosylated analogues followed by nucleophilic substitution affords compounds of Structure 34. Oxidation of compounds of Structure 33 provides the formyl derivatives of Structure 35. Addition of a nucleophile to compounds of Structure 35 gives secondary alcohol analogues of Structure 36. Further manipulation affords compounds of Structure 37.<br><br>
Scheme VII describes Knorr reactions of substituted anilines to produce functionalized quinolinone compounds. The process of Scheme VII starts with alkylation of an aniline<br><br>
compound such as Structure 38 with trifluoroacetaldehyde in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride followed by zinc reduction to provide an alkylated bis-amine compound such as Structure 39. A typical Knorr procedure converts the alkylated amine compound 39 and ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate to a quinolinone compound such as 40. Reductive alkylation of compounds of 40 provides a bis-alkylaminoquinolinone such as Structure 41. Treatment of compounds of Structure 41 with thiophenol affords 7-hydroxyquinolinone compounds such as<br><br>
Scheme VIII describes the synthesis of 6-alkylaminocoumarins, as demonstrated by Structure 45, from phenol through a similar route as that described in Schemes I and II. A mixture of a phenol compound and a 3-ketoester such as ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate are heated in refluxing toluene in the presence of TsOH to afford a coumarin compound e.g., Structure 43. Nitration of coumarin compounds (e.g., Structure 43) followed by hydrogenation give aminocoumarin compounds such as Structure 44. Sequential reductive alkylation provides dialkylamino-coumarin compounds as shown in Structure 45. Hydrogenation of a dialkylamino-coumarin compound (e.g., Structure 45) affords compounds Structure 46.<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, the syntheses of benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 49) and derivatives thereof (e.g., Structures 51 and 52) are shown in Scheme IX.<br>
The process of Scheme IX begins with the treatment of an alkenylaniline compound such as Structure 47 with chloroformate in the presence of DMAP in THF to produce carbamates such as Structure 48. Benzoxazinone compounds such as Structure 49 (W=O) are produced by p-tolylsulfonic acid catalyzed intra-molecular cyclization of a carbamate (e.g., Structure 48).<br>
An alternate synthesis of benzo-oxazinone compounds of Structure 49 is also shown in Scheme IX. In this synthetic route, carbon nucleophiles are added to 2-aminobenzoic acid to give the amino-alcohol compound 50, which is converted to an aminobenzo-oxazinone compound such as Structure 49 by either l,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in THF or the carbonate-cyclization route as described above. A classic nitration reaction of the aromatic benzoxazinone compound by nitric acid in concentrate sulfuric acid followed by palladium catalyzed hydrogenation produces amino compounds such as Structure 51. A two-step sequential reductive alkylation as described previously produces dialkylamine-benzoxazinone compounds as shown in Structure 52.<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, bioisosteres of 6-amino-2-quinolinones such as 5-amino-oxinole, 6-amino-benzoxazinone and quinoline compounds, which are useful AR and PR modulators, are prepared from a corresponding bicyclic compound. The bicyclic compounds such as Structures 53, 56 and 58 are prepared by synthetic methods known to those skilled in the  art.<br>
Scheme X describes a synthetic process for preparing 5-bisalkylamino-oxindole compounds such as Structure 55 and 6-bisalkylated compounds of Structures 57 and 59. The method for preparing these compounds is described in Scheme IX and is analogous to the preparation of compounds such as Structure 52 from the corresponding quinolinone compound. The process involves sequential nitration, reduction and/or alkylation of the amine to produce compounds of Structures 55, 57 and 59.<br><br><br>
Scheme XI describes a preferred synthetic method to prepare 7-alkylamino-2-quinolinones such as Structure 63 via the Knorr reaction as previously described. The process of Scheme XI begins with a modified Knorr cyclization of 1,3-phenylenediamines of Structure 60 to give a 7-aminoquinolinone compound such as Structure 61. A sequential reductive alkylation of Structure 61 in a similar process as that described in Scheme II affords compounds such as Structure 62. Alkylation of quinolinone such as 62 with alkyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydride generates 1-alkyl quinolinone compounds such as Structure 63.<br><br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, alkylamino-quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 66) are prepared from a corresponding amino-quinolinone compound. Schemes XII, XIII and XIV describe the methods of introducing a quaternary carbon next to the amino position.<br>
The process of Scheme XII begins with the treatment of a 7-aminoquinolinone such as Structure 61a with acetic acid in acetone to afford an alkyl amino-quinolinone compound such as Structure 64. Methyllithium addition to a compound such as Structure 64 in THF provides the corresponding alcohol adduct e.g., Structure 65. An acid catalyzed dehydration of an amino alcohol compound such as 65 gives an alkene amino-quinolinone compound such as 66.<br><br>
In another preferred reaction sequence, alkyl-quinolinones are produced by a Knorr cyclization of a diamine compound as previously described. Subsequent alkylation and oxidation produces alkyl-quinolinone compounds. The alkylamine-quinolinones may then be<br><br>
further converted to various derivative compounds by reactions known to those skilled in the art as exemplified in the examples below.<br>
Scheme XIII describes an alternate procedure to synthesize 2-quinolinones with a quaternary carbon adjacent to the 7-nitrogen. The process of Scheme XIII begins with a typical Knorr cyclization of a 1,3-phenylenediamine with a α-ketoester, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate, to afford an aminoquinoline compound such as 67 as a minor product. Alkylation of an aminoquinoline compound such as 67 with an amide such as N-phenyl-α-bromoisobutyramide in the presence of sodium hydride affords an alkylated quinoline product such as 68 in good yield. Hydrolysis of an alkylated quinoline compound (e.g., Structure 68) with HI provides a 2-quinolinone such as 69. Methylation of an alkylated quinoline compound such as 68 with iodomethane in the presence of sodium hydride followed by HI mediated hydrolysis produces a quinolinone such as Structure 70. Reduction of an amide compound such .  as 70 with DIBAL-H affords an aldehyde compound such as 71 and an alcohol product such as . 72. Wittig reaction of aldehydes such as 71 affords olefins such as Structure 73. Hydrogenation of an allylamino-quinolinone compound such as Structure 73 produces a corresponding alkylamino-quinolinone compound as shown in Structure 74.<br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, alkylamino-quinolinone compounds are produced by copper chloride catalyzed substitution of an amino-quinolinone compound. Scheme XIV describes an alternate N-alkylation method for the preparation of alkylamino-quinolinone compounds. Treatment of an amino quinolinone compound such as 61a and propargyl acetate<br><br>
with copper chloride and a base such as triethylamine in THF affords alkylamine-quinolinone products such as 75. Hydrogenation of an amino-acetylene compound such as 75 provides an alkylamino quinolinone compound as shown in Structure 76 in excellent yield.<br><br>
Alkyl-diamino compounds (e.g. Structure 78) are produced by two alternate synthetic methods in another preferred synthetic route as shown in Scheme XV. Alkylations of amino compounds as shown below are reactions known to those skilled in the art. The reaction as shown below is as an example of the preparation of these types of compounds.<br>
The process of Scheme XV begins with alkylation of a mono-protected 1,3-phenylenediamine followed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) mediated de-protection to produce diamino compounds such as Structure 78. Alternately, alkylation of a 3-nitroaniline followed by a reduction of the nitro group generates the same intermediates of Structure 78. Knorr cyclization as previously described in the presence of a a-keto-ester such as ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate affords compounds such as Structure 79 in good yield.<br><br><br>
Substituted diamino compounds are produced in another preferred embodiment of the invention. The diamino compounds are then further reacted to produce quinolinone compounds via the Knorr reaction as previously described. Scheme XVI describes a synthetic process for producing alkoxy-alkylamino-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 84.<br>
The process starts with substitution of a bis-nitrofluorobenzene with 2,2,2-trifluoroethyanol in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride to provide an alkoxy-nitrobenzene compound such as Structure 81. Conversion of bis-nitro groups to bis-amino groups is accomplished by hydrogenation or metal reduction to give aniline compounds such as Structure 82, A standard Knorr reaction with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate and p-tolylsufonic acid affords alkoxy-quinolinones such as Structure 83 in high yield. An alkoxy-amino-quinolinone compound such as 83 may subsequently be alkylated as previously described. For example, reductive alkylation of a compound such as Structure 83 with an aldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride gives alkoxy-alkylamino-quinolinone compounds as shown in Structure 84.<br><br><br>
In another preferred reaction, substituted diamine compounds (e.g., Structure 87) are produced by electrophilic aromatic substitution of activated aromatic amino-benzene rings. The substituted diamine compounds are then further reacted to produce quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 88) and subsequent quinolinone derivatives thereof (e.g., Structure 89) as previously described. Quinolinone compounds as shown in Scheme XVII are useful PR and AR modulators as described herein.<br>
Scheme XVII describes processes to synthesize substituted alkylaminoquinolinone compounds such as 89. Treatment of ortho-substituted aniline such as Structure 85 or a 4-substituted aniline such as 90 with nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid generates meta-nitrated products such as 86 or 91 in high yield. Hydrogenation of the nitro group on compounds such as 86 or 91 provides the Knorr precursors as shown as Structure 87. Treatment of 1,3-phenylenediamines such as 87 with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate in refluxing toluene in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid, such as p-tolylsufonic acid, affords quinolinone<br><br>
compounds as shown in Structure 88. Additional alkylation at the 7-amino group provides more functionalized compounds such as Structure 89 as previously described.<br><br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, functionalized quinolinones or functionalized dihydro-quinolinones are prepred from the corresponding substituted diamino-benzene compound (e.g. Structure 92). The amino portion of the quinolinone and dihydro-quinolinone compounds (e.g. Structures 94 and 93), may then be converted to other functional groups by chemical reactions known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such conversions are demonstrated in Scheme XVIII, forexample in the preparation of compounds such as 95, 96, 97 and 100.<br><br>
Scheme XVIII above describes methods of preparing functionalized quinolinones. The process of Scheme XVIII begins with modified Knorr reactions of diamine 92 with ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate. In the p-tolylsufonic acid catalyzed refluxing toluene condition quinolinone compounds such as 94 are major products. In an alternate synthesis, the reaction is carried out in refluxing ethanol, which produces compounds such as Structure 93 as major products. Compounds such as 93 may then be converted to quinolinones such as 94 by acid catalyzed dehydration. The 5-amino group of compounds 93 or 94 is converted to 5-hydroxy derivatives of Structure 95 by diazotization-hydrolysis conditions using sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid. A similar condition by sodium nitrite and chloride converts the 5-amino to 5-chloro derivatives of Structure 98. Reductive alkylation of compounds of Structures 94 and 99 affords compounds of Structures 96 and 100.<br><br>
Another synthetic route into functionalized quinolinone compounds (e.g. Structures 102 and 104) is shown in Scheme XIX. Scheme XIX describes the synthesis of substituted quinolinone compounds such as Structures 102 and 104 under similar Knorr reaction conditions as that described in Scheme I. The Knorr reaction may also be used on substituted aniline compounds (e.g. Structure 101) to produce functionalized quinolinone compounds such as Structure 102. The functionalized quinolinone compounds as shown above may then be converted to other functional groups to produce additional quinolinone derivatives such as compounds of Structure 104 as described herein.<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the invention, halogenated quinolinones, benzo-oxazinones, indolones, benzothiozolones, and quinazolinones (i.e., arylhalogen compounds) produce alkylated derivatives by a C-C coupling of the arylhalogen carbon and a ketone with a lithium reagent.

In another aspect of the invention, functionalized quinolinone compounds (e.g., Structure 105 and 109) are produced by a C-C coupling of a halo-quinolinone such as Structure 16a and a ketone as shown in Schemes XX and XXI. The halo-quinolinone may be produced by either of two synthetic routes as shown below in Scheme XX. Scheme XX describes the synthesis of a number of functionalized quinolinone compounds.<br>
3-FIuorinated-quinolinone compounds such as Structure 16a may be formed by treatment of a 3-ketoamide 15 with a fluorination reagent, such as fluorobenzenesulfonimide, to provide a fluorinated derivative product such as Structure 15a, which is converted to the 3-fluoro quinoiinone compound 16a (R = fluorine) by the Knorr cyclization with concentrated sulfuric acid.<br><br>
A 7-methoxy analogue of Structure 16a is prepared by NBS bromination of quinolinone 29a. Addition of a dianion generated from a bromo-quinolinone such as 16a by two equivalents of base, such as alkyllithium, to a ketone affords the tertiary alcohols as shown in Structure 105. Dehydration of an alcohol sucfi as 105 with a catalytic amount of acid, such as sulfuric acid, gives olefins of Structure 106. Subsequent hydrogenation of olefins such as 106 provides an alkyl-quinolinone such as Structure 107. A thioquinolinone derivative may be synthesized by treatment of compounds 107 with Lawesson's reagent in toluene as previously described.<br><br>
Scheme XXI describes a process of preparing alkenyl-quinolinone compounds.

Reduction of the oxo group on a compound such as 109 with DIBAH provides the alcohol derivative as shown in Structure 110.<br><br><br>
A further example of the conversion of arylhalogen compounds (e.g. Structure 16) to arylalkyl compounds is shown in Scheme XXII. Scheme XXII describes the preparation of additional 6-alkyl 2-quinolinone compounds from the quinolinone dianion in a preferred aspect of the invention. Addition of a dianion generated from a bromo quinolinone, methyllithium and n-butyllithium to benzophenone gives an alkyl quinolinone such as compound 111. Reduction of compound 111 with triethylsilane in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as TFA, affords an alkyl-quinolinone compound such as 112.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, aryl halogen compounds are converted to aryl alkynes by a palladium catalyzed coupling reaction between the aryl halogen (e.g., Structure 16) and a terminal alkyne as shown above in Scheme XXII. For example, a palladium(II) catalyzed reaction of a bromoquinolinone such as 16 and a terminal alkyne such as dimethyl propargyl alcohol provides an alkynyl-quinolinone compound such as 113.<br><br><br>
A method of converting arylhalides to arylalkyl compounds is also employed with benzo-oxazinone compounds as shown in the above example. Scheme XXIII describes methods of synthesizing alkyl l,3-benzo[d]oxazin-2-one compounds.<br>
The process of Scheme XXIII begins with a bromination of a compound such as 49a with bromine to give a bromobenzo-oxazinone compound such as 114. Addition of the dianion generated from the lithiation of a compound such as 49a to a ketone provides the hydroxy-alkyl adducts of Structure 115. Dehydration of alcohol derivative 115 with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid affords compounds such as Structure 116, which may be hydrogenated to give compounds such as Structure 118. Benzothiooxazinone compounds as shown in Structure 117   are prepared from the corresponding carbonyl compound (e.g., such as Structure 116) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent as previously described.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXIV describes additional methods to prepare alkyl benzo-oxazinones. The process of Scheme XXIV begins with addition of the dianion generated from lithiation of compound 114 by alkyllithium to a protected 1,3-cyclodiketone. Hydrolysis of adducts with an acid affords alkene compounds Structure 119. Addition of n-butyllithium to an enone such as 119 provides a tertiary alcohol such as 122. Reduction of the enone 119 with DIBAL-H gives a   . secondary alcohol such as 120. Hydrogenation affords compound such as 121. Alkyl thio-benzo-oxazinone compounds are prepared by a similar process but using a thiobenzo-oxazinone such as 118a in place of the oxo compound.<br><br><br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention, substituted benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 125) are prepared for an amino-benzoic acid and an organometallic reagent to form a hydroxy-aniline compound (e.g., Structure 124) with either a halide or carbonyl diimidazole to form a benzo-oxazinone. The process of Scheme XXV begins with addition of either alkyl lithium or a Grignard reagent to a 2-aminobenzoic acid such as Structure 123 to generate amino alcohol compound such as Structure 124. A previously described cyclization procedure-from either l,1'-carbonyldiimidazole treatment or acid catalyzed carbamate intermediate affords compounds such as Structure 125. Treatment of benzo-oxazinone compounds (e.g., Structure 125) with bromine provides brominated benzo-oxazinone compounds such as Structure 126. Addition of an anion generated from compounds such as 126 and an alkyl lithium reagent to a ketone such as cyclohexanone affords compounds such as Structure 127. The alkenyl-benzo-oxazinone compound (e.g., 127) may be hydrogenated to give alkyl compounds such as Structure 128.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXVI describes a process to introduce a trifluoromethyl group at the 4-position of benzo-oxazinone compounds. The process starts with addition of an N-protected 2-aminoaryl lithium generated by metal halogen exchange of 2-aminobromobenzene and n-butyllithium to ethyl trifluoroacetate followed by a reduction with sodium borohydride to provide compounds such as 129. Acid catalyzed cyclization of compounds such as 129 afford benzo-oxazinone compounds such as 130. The benzo-oxazinone compound may subsequently be treated with bromine to generate a bis-brominated product such as 131. As previously described, the bromine may be substituted with an alkyl group. For example, the 6-cyclohexenyl derivative 132 is prepared in a similar fashion as that described in Scheme XXV.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXVII describes methods to prepare alkyl oxindole derivatives by bromination  of the oxindole followed by substitution of the bromine group with an alkyl group as previously described. The process starts with alkylation of 2-indoIone with alkyl halides in the presence of n-butyllithium followed by selective bromination to afford brominated oxindole compounds (e.g., Structure 133). The alkyl-indolone compounds are prepared from a bromo compound such as 133 by a procedure similar to that as described in Scheme XXV.<br><br>
Scheme XXVIII describes a synthetic route of producing alkyl-benzothiozolones. The process is similar to that as described in Scheme XXV but using a halogenated benzothiozolone compound.<br><br><br>

The process of Scheme XXIX begins with bromination of compound 140 to afford compound 141, which is derivatized by treatment with benzyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride to give compound 142. A palladium catalyzed aromatic substitution of compounds of Structure 141 or 142 by Grignard reagents provides compounds of Structure 143.<br><br><br>
Scheme XXX describes an alternate method of preparing aryl-quinolinones by a modified Suzuki coupling reaction. The process starts with palladium catalyzed biaryl coupling of a bromo compound such as Structure 16c, a brominated quinolinone, with an aryl boronic acid (e.g., Structure 144). Aryl compounds such as Structure 145 are produced in this manner. The boronic acids of Structure 144 come from commercial sources or may be generated from aryl bromides by a standard three-step procedure which includes metal halogen exchange, addition to methyl borate and acidic work-up. Aryl substituted compounds of the present invention (e.g., Structure 145) may be further functionalized by modification of the substituents on the aryl group by standard synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. Alternately, aryl substituted compounds of the present invention such as Structure 145 may be prepared from the aryl aniline (e.g., 6-arylaniline, Structure 147) as shown above by a Knorr reaction procedure as previously described.<br><br>
Scheme XXXI describes additional methods to prepare 6-substituted 2-quinolinones such as Structures 149, 150, 152 and 153. Lithiation of Structure 17 followed by addition to a Weinreb's amide afford compounds of Structure 148. Hydrolysis of quinolines such as Structure<br><br>
148 provides compounds of Structure 149. Compounds of Structure 150 are obtained by reductive amination of compounds such as Structure 149. Addition of a nucleophile to quinoline ketones of Structure 148 generates alcohols of Structure 151, which are treated with acid to afford compounds of Structures 152 and 153.<br><br>

Scheme XXXIII describes methods to prepare compounds with a diazo containing side chain. Treatment of 6-aminoquinolinones such as Structure 7a with NaNO2 affords compounds of Structure 157. Reduction of nitroso compounds such as Structure 157 followed by alkylation provide analogues of Structure 158. Alkylation or acylation of hydrazine such as Structure 159 generates compounds of Structures 160 and 161.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also include racemates, stereoisomers and mixtures of said compounds, including isotopically labeled and radio-labeled compounds. Such isomers can be isolated by standard resolution techniques, including fractional crystallization and chiral column chromatography.<br>
As noted above, any of the steroid modulator compounds of the present invention can be combined-in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to provide pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating the biological conditions or disorders noted herein in mammalian, and more preferably, in human patients. The particular carrier employed in these pharmaceutical compositions may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the type of administration desired, e.g., intravenous, oral, topical, suppository or parenteral.<br><br>
In preparing the compositions in oral liquid dosage forms (e.g., suspensions, elixirs and solutions), typical pharmaceutical media, such as water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be employed. Similarly, when preparing oral solid dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets and capsules), carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like will be employed. Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage form for the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
For parenteral administration, the carrier will typically comprise sterile water, although other ingredients that aid in solubility or serve as preservatives, may also be included. Furthermore, injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like will be employed.<br>
For topical administration, the compounds of the present invention may be formulated using bland, moisturizing bases, such as ointments or creams. Examples of suitable ointment bases are petrolatum, petrolatum plus volatile silicones, lanolin, and water in oil emulsions such as Eucerin™ (Beiersdorf). Examples of suitable cream bases are Nivea™ Cream (Beiersdorf), cold cream (USP), Purpose Cream™ (Johnson &amp; Johnson), hydrophilic ointment (USP), and Lubriderm™ (Warner-Lambert).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and compounds of the present invention will generally be administered in the form of a dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule etc.) at from about 1 p.g/kg of body weight to about 500 mg/kg of body weight, more preferably from about 10 u,g/kg to about 100 mg/kg, and most preferably from about 20 ug/kg to about 20 mg/kg. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the particular quantity of pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention administered to a patient will depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the biological activity desired, the condition of the patient, and tolerance for the drug.<br>
The compounds of this invention also have utility when radio- or isotopically-labeled as ligands for use in assays to determine the presence of AR or PR in a cell background or extract. They are particularly useful due to their ability to selectively activate androgen receptors or progesterone receptors, and can therefore be used to determine the presence of such receptors in the presence of other steroid receptors or related intracellular receptors.<br><br>
Due to the selective specificity of the compounds of this invention for steroid receptors, these compounds can be used to purify samples of steroid receptors in vitro. Such purification can be carried out by mixing samples containing steroid receptors with one or more of the compounds of the present invention so that the compounds bind to the receptors of choice, and then separating out the bound ligand/receptor combination by separation techniques which are known to those of skill in the art. These techniques include column separation, filtration, centrifugation, tagging and physical separation, and antibody complexing, among others.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can advantageously be used in the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein. In this regard, the compounds and compositions of the present invention will prove particularly useful as modulators of male sex steroid-dependent diseases and conditions such as the treatment of acne, male-pattern baldness, male hormone replacement therapy, wasting diseases, hirsutism, stimulation of hematopoiesis, hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia, osteoporosis (agonist), male contraception (agonist), impotence (agonist), cancer cachexia (agonist) various hormone-dependent cancers, including, without limitation, prostate and breast cancer and as anabolic agents.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention possess a number of advantages over previously identified steroidal and non-steroidal compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention possess a number of advantages over previously identified steroid modulator compounds. For example, the compounds are extremely potent activators of AR, preferably displaying 50% maximal activation of AR at a concentration of less than 100 nM, more preferably at a concentration of less than 50 nM, more preferably yet at a concentration of less than 20 nM, and most preferably at a concentration of 10 nM or less. Also, the selective compounds of the present invention generally do not display undesired cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors, as is seen with the compound mifepristone (RU486; Roussel Uclaf), a known PR antagonist that displays an undesirable cross reactivity on GR and AR, thereby limiting its use in long-term, chronic administration. In addition, the compounds of the present invention, as small organic molecules, are easier to synthesize, provide greater stability and can be more easily administered in oral dosage forms than other known steroidal compounds.<br><br>
The invention will be further illustrated by reference to the following non-limiting Examples.<br>

10     Steroid Receptor Activity<br>
Utilizing the "cis-trans" or "co-transfection" assay described by Evans et al., Science. 240:889-95 (May 13, 1988), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, the compounds of the present invention were tested and found to have strong, specific activity as both agonists, partial agonists and antagonists of AR. This assay is described in further detail in<br>
15      U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,784 and 5,071,773, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The co-transfection assay provides a method for identifying functional agonists and partial agonists which mimic, or antagonists which inhibit, the effect of native hormones, and quantifying their activity for responsive IR proteins. In this regard, the co-transfection assay<br>
20     mimics an in vivo system in the laboratory. Importantly, activity in the co-transfection assay correlates very well with known w vivo activity, such that the co-transfection assay functions as a qualitative and quantitative predictor of a tested compounds jn vivo pharmacology. See, e.g.. T. Berger et al. 41 J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol. 773 (1992), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
25	In the co-transfection assay, a cloned cDNA for an IR (e.g., human PR, AR or GR) under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter (e.g., the SV 40 promoter) is introduced by transfection (a procedure to induce cells to take up foreign genes) into a background cell substantially devoid of endogenous IRs. This introduced gene directs the recipient cells to make the IR protein of interest. A second gene is also introduced (co-transfected) into the same cells in conjunction<br>
30     with the IR gene. This second gene, comprising the cDNA for a reporter protein, such as firefly<br>
7Pc°<br><br>
luciferase (LUC), controlled by an appropriate hormone responsive promoter containing a hormone response element (HRE). This reporter plasmid functions as a reporter for the transcription-modulating activity of the target IR. Thus, the reporter acts as a surrogate for the products (mRNA then protein) normally expressed by a gene under control of the target receptor 5     and its native hormone.<br>
The co-transfection assay can detect small molecule agonists or antagonists of target IRs. Exposing the transfected cells to an agonist ligand compound increases reporter activity in the transfected cells. This activity can be conveniently measured, e.g., by increasing luciferase production, which reflects compound-dependent, IR-mediated increases in reporter transcription.<br>
10     To detect antagonists, the co-transfection assay is carried out in the presence of a constant<br>
concentration of an agonist to the target IR (e.g., progesterone for PR) known to induce a defined reporter signal. Increasing concentrations of a suspected antagonist will decrease the reporter signal (e.g., luciferase production). The co-transfection assay is therefore useful to detect both agonists and antagonists of specific IRs. Furthermore, it determines not only whether a<br>
15     compound interacts with a particular IR, but whether this interaction mimics (agonizes) or blocks<br>
«<br>
(antagonizes) the effects of the native regulatory molecules on target gene expression, as well as the specificity and strength of this interaction.<br>
The activity of selected steroid receptor modulator compounds of the present invention were evaluated utilizing the co-transfection assay, and in standard IR binding assays, according 20     to the following illustrative Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 467 Co-transfection assay<br>
CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts) were cultured in the presence of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% charcoal resin-stripped 25     fetal bovine serum then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates one day prior to transfection.<br>
To determine AR agonist and antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention, the CV-1 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation according to the procedure of Berger et al., 41 J. Steroid Biochem.Mol. Biol, 733 (1992) with the following plasmids: pShAR (5 ng/well), MTV-LUC reporter (100 ng/well), pRS-B-Gal (50<br><br>
ng/well) and filler DNA (pGEM; 45 ng/well). The receptor plasmid, pRShAR, contains the human AR under constitutive control of the SV-40 promoter, as more fully described in J. A. Simental et al., "Transcriptional activation and nuclear targeting signals of the human androgen receptor", 266 J. Biol. Chem., 510 (1991).<br>
The reporter plasmid, MTV-LUC, contains the cDNA for firefly luciferase (LUC) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) long terminal repeat, a conditional promoter containing an androgen response element. See e.g, Berger et al. supra. In addition, pRS-B-Gal, coding for constitutive expression of E. coli B-galactosidase (B-Gal), was included as an internal control for evaluation of transfection efficiency and compound toxicity.<br>
Six hours after transfection, media was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Media containing reference compounds (i.e. progesterone as a PR agonist, mifepristone ((1 lbeta,17beta)-l l.-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17-hydroxy-17-(l-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one: RU486; Roussel Uclaf) as a PR antagonist; dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma Chemical) as an AR agonist and 2-OH-flutamide (the active metabolite of 2-methyl-N-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyI)phenyl]pronanamide; Schering-Plough) as an AR antagonist; estradiol (Sigma) as an ER agonist and ICI 164,384 (N-butyl-3,17-dihydroxy-N-methyl-(7-alpha,17-beta)-estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-7-undecanamide; ICI Americas) as an ER antagonist; dexamethasone (Sigma) as a GR agonist and RU486 as a GR antagonist; and aldosterone (Sigma) as a MR agonist and spironolactone ((7-alpha-[acetylthio]-17-alpha-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid gamma-lactone; Sigma) as an MR antagonist) and/or the modulator compounds of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10"'2 to 10-5 M were added to the cells. Three to four replicates were used for each sample. Transfections and subsequent procedures were performed on a Biomek 1000 automated laboratory work station.<br>
After 40 hours, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed with a Triton X-l 00-based buffer and assayed for LUC and B-Gal activities using a luminometer or spectrophotometer, respectively. For each replicate, the normalized response (NR) was calculated as:<br>
LUC response/B-Gal rate<br>
where B-Gal rate = B-Gal*lxl0-5/B-Gal incubation time.<br><br>
The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the NR were calculated. Data was plotted as the response of the compound compared to the reference compounds over the range of the dose-response curve. For agonist experiments, the effective concentration that produced 50% of the maximum response (EC50) was quantified. Agonist efficacy was a function (%) of LUC expression relative to the maximum LUC production by the reference agonist for PR, AR, ER, GR or MR, Antagonist activity was determined by testing the amount of LUC expression in the presence of a fixed amount of DHT as an AR agonist and progesterone as a PR agonist at the EC50 concentration. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of LUC expression induced by the reference agonist were quantified (IC50). In addition, the efficacy of antagonists was determined as a function (%) of maximal inhibition. IR Binding assay<br>
AR Binding: For the whole cell binding assay, COS-1 cells in 96-well microtiter plates containing DMEM-10% FBS were transfected as described above with the following plasmid DNA: pRShAR (2 ng/well), pRS-β-Gal (50 ng/well) and pGEM (48 ng/well). Six hours after transfection, media was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and fresh media was added. The next day, the media was changed to DMEM-serum free to remove any endogenous ligand that might be complexed with the receptor in the cells.<br>
After 24 hours in serum-free media, either a saturation analysis to determine the Kd for<br>
tritiated dihydrotestosterone (^H-DHT) on human AR or a competitive binding assay to evaluate the ability of test compounds to compete with ^H-DHT for AR was performed. For the saturation analysis, media (DMEM-0.2% CA-FBS) containing 3H-DHT (in concentrations ranging from 12 nM to 0.24 nM) in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT were added to the cells. For the competitive binding assay, media containing 1 nM ^H-DHT and test compounds in concentrations ranging from 10"10 to 10-6 M were added to the cells. Three replicates were used for each sample. After three hours at 37°C, an aliquot of the total binding media at each concentration of 3H-DHT was removed to estimate the amount of free 3H-DHT.   The remaining media was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound ligand, and cells were lysed with a Triton X-100-based buffer. The lysates were assayed for amount of<br><br>
bound 3H-DHT and β-Gal activity using a scintillation counter or spectrophotometer, respectively.<br>
For the saturation analyses, the difference between the total binding and the nonspecific binding, normalized by the B-Gal rate, was defined as specific binding. The specific binding was<br>
evaluated by Scatchard analysis to determine the Kd for 3H-DHT. See e.g., D. Rodbard, "Mathematics and statistics of Hgand assays: an illustrated guide" In: J. Langon and J.J. Clapp, eds., Ligand Assay, Masson Publishing U.S.A., Inc., New York, pp. 45-99, (1981), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. For the competition studies, the data was plotted as<br>
the amount of 3H-DHT (% of control in the absence of test compound) remaining over the range of the dose-response curve for a given compound. The concentration of test compound that inhibited:50% of the amount of 3H-DHT bound in the absence of competing ligand was quantified (IC50) after log-logit transformation. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 values, where:<br><br>
After correcting for non-specific binding, IC50 values were determined. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC50 value was determined graphically from a log-logit plot of the data. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equivuation to the IC50 "values, the labeled ligand concentration and the Kd of the labeled ligand.<br>
The agonist, antagonist and binding activity assay results of selected androgen receptor modulator compounds of present invention and the standard reference compounds on AR, as well as the cross-reactivity of selected compounds on the PR, ER, MR and GR receptors, are shown in Tables 1-2 below. Efficacy is reported as the percent maximal response observed for each compound relative to the reference agonist and antagonist compounds indicated above. Also reported in Tables 1-2 for each compound is its antagonist potency or IC50 (which is the concentration (nM), required to reduce the maximal response by 50%), its agonist potency or EC50 (nM).<br><br>
