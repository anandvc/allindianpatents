				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>This  invention  IMPROVISED  WATER  HEATER provides a slim model water heater, which occupies less space, ensures continuous flow of hot water, minimising the heating time too. In contrary to the conventional models, this water heater carries multiple narrow storage tanks, which carry heating elements within and as such water is heated in different stages, owing to the continuous exposure to the heating elements. This constant heating ensures that the temperature is retained till the end. This IMPROVISED WATER HEATER basically constitutes of five narrow tanks, each of them individually housing heating elements at their base and water is transferred from one tank to another through seamless stainless steel tubes in order to minimise the heat loss or the temperature loss. As the water is continuously passed through narrow tanks, the mixing ratio attained is less than 2%, at the same time ensuring delivery of hot water at constant temperature.</td>

This Invention IMPROVISED WATER HEATER is aimed at an unique and compact domestic water heater, which occupies very little space, as compared to the conventional models, ensures uniform heating of the stored water and also delivers hot water continuously under constant temperature. The main draw backs of the conventional models that are available in the market are: not compact and occupy a lot of place when accommodated in a bathroom or kitchen, the stored water does not get heated uniformly and the temperature of water emanating from the water heater is not uniform, thereby causing a lot of discomfort to the human body. This is because all conventional water heaters are made up of a single tank with a single heating source located in the bottom centre. In these models, the water gets heated erratically and normally the whole tank is not under the same temperature. The top most part attains the maximum temperature, whereas the bottom most part in the water tank retains the least temperature. During withdrawal of hot water from the water heater tank, the cold water enters and diminishes the temperature considerably and the cold-hot water mixing ratio is around 10 to 20%. All these drawbacks have been essentially overcome in this newly invented IMROIVSED WATER HEATER.<br><br>
In this newly invented IMPROVISED WATER HEATER, instead of a single water heater tank, which is normally the case in conventional models, multiple narrow tanks have been incorporated, which have been depicted as A, B, C, D &amp; E in the accompanying Drawing Sheet, which ensures uniform heating of the water. The heating elements in the different chambers have been identified as Fl, F2, F3, F4 &amp; F5, respectively, in the enclosed drawing. The advantage in this system is that water is exposed to the heating element in five stages, wherein it gets re-heated in the chambers B, C, D &amp; E, which ensures uniform and constant heating of water throughout. In the said IMPROVISED WATER HEATER, cold water enters tank A through the inlet Y and lands at point K in tank A. Water landing at point K in tank A gets heated and then moves to tank B through a stainless steel pipe L from the top most point. This pre-heated water again attains temperature and moves on to tank C through a stainless steel pipe M from the top most point.   Similarly the water passes through the remaining tanks D&amp;E, consequently getting heated by exposure to heating filaments F4   &amp;   F5. By the time water reaches outlet X, it attains maximum bath temperature of 42 degree centigrade. Tank E also acts as a booster, where the preheated water enters through pipe O at the top most point and the discharge occurs also on the top most point J.<br><br>
In this newly invented IMPROVISED WATER HEATER, all<br>
pipes and tanks are made out of stainless steel, to minimise heat loss. Further, as the hot water is continuously passed through narrow tanks, the mixing ratio attained is less than 2%. Mixing Ratio is the ratio of mixing of cold water and hot water in a water heater. The test is usually conducted by drawing hot water with the cold water line open. So, whenever hot water is drawn, cold water enters the tank automatically. In this process cold water mixes with the hot water to some extent. The output reading is then compared with another test where the cold water line is closed and only the hot water is drawn out. The difference between the two above reading is taken as mixing ratio and is reported in percentage. Thus, the efficiency of a water heater is determined by its mixing ratio. Lower the mixing ratio, more efficient is the water heater. Tests conducted on this IMPROVISED WATER HEATER shows the mixing ratio as 1.92% as against 9.58% of a standard water heater.<br>
Thus,    this    newly    invented    IMPROVISED    WATER<br>
HEATER is very efficient, enables flat models, which are very slim, consuming lesser space. Further, lowest mixing factor is attained as enumerated above and the said Improvised water heater delivers hot water at constant temperature.<br><br><br>
1 Claim,<br>
1.   An  IMPROVISED  WATER  HEATER  to   heat  the   water  stored uniformly and to ensure constant hot water supply at a very minimum mixing ratio of less than 2%, which essentially consists of  a plurality number of narrow water tanks,   A, B, C, D &amp; E in this case,   housing heating elements Fl, F2, F3, F4 &amp; F5 respectively, fixed to the bottom base of the narrow water tanks, wherein the stored water gets heated individually in each tank; arrangement of the pipes being such that water entering and exiting from each tank is at the top most point of each tank; cold water enters tank A through the inlet Y and lands at point K, which gets heated there and moves on to Tank B through a seamless stainless steel pipe L, subsequently the re-heated water moving on to  the tank C through a stainless steel pipe M from the top most point and then similarly to Tank D and finally to Tank E before the fully heated water exits at X through the pipe H<br>
2.   An IMPROVISED WATER HEATER, as claimed in Claim (1) and as<br><br>
substantially explained herein with reference to the accompanying Drawing.<br>
