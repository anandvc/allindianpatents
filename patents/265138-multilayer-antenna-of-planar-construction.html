345 P 459 PCT__________________________________________<br>
Multilayer antenna of planar construction______________<br>
The invention relates to a multilayer antenna of planar construction according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Patch antennas or what are known as microstrip antennas are sufficiently well known. They conventionally comprise an electrically conductive base, a dielectric carrier material arranged thereabove and an electrically conductive radiation face provided on the upper side of the dielectric carrier material. The upper radiation face is generally stimulated by a supply line extending transversely to the aforementioned planes and layers. The connection cable used is usually a coaxial cable, the outer conductor of which is electrically connected to the ground conductor at a terminal, whereas the inner conductor of the coaxial cable is electrically connected to the radiation face located at the top.<br>
Multilayer antennas of planar construction have, for example, become known in the form of what are known as stacked patch antennas. This type of antenna allows the bandwidth of such an antenna to be increased or resonances to be ensured in two or more frequency ranges. Antennas of this type may also be used to improve the antenna gain.<br>
The prior publication IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. AP-27, NO. 2, MARCH 1979, pages 270 to 273, describes a multilayer patch antenna allowing resonance in two frequency ranges. The patch antenna accordingly has, for example, in addition to the bottom ground face and the radiation face arranged offset with<br>
ground face and the radiation face and also between the radiation face and the patch face located thereabove consists, in each case, of a substrate having a uniform dielectric constant.<br>
A patch antenna comprising carrier layers having different dielectric constants has become known, for example, from the prior publication IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 47, NO. 12, DECEMBER 1999, pages 1780 to 1784. Foam is used as the upper carrier layer for the upper metallic face (patch face). The distance between the upper patch face and the radiation face located therebelow corresponds to the distance between the radiation face and the lower ground face.<br>
The prior publication IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 47, NO. 12, DECEMBER 1999, pages 1767 to 1771, among other documents, demonstrates that antenna gain may be increased using multilayer patch antennas.<br>
Finally, a generic antenna having a multilayer construction has become known, for example, from US 5,880,694 A. The antenna comprises a lower ground face, a dielectric carrying member located thereon and having a radiator face located on its upper side. Above the radiator face there is arranged a further dielectric member on which there is provided, on the side remote from the lower ground face, an electrically conductive patch face.<br>
A drawback of all previously known antenna arrangements of this type is the comparatively complex construction. For, in the use of conventional commercial patch antennas having a ground face, an electric carrying member (substrate) located thereon and a radiation face located thereabove, it is invariably complex to supplement an antenna of this type to form a multilayer antenna.<br>
Depending on the use of conventional commercial patch antennas, which comprise at least a lower ground face, a substrate made from a dielectric material, for example ceramics, and a radiation face located thereon, a dielectric carrier layer, possibly of variable thickness, would then have to be produced in each case and, for example, positioned and secured on the radiation face of the conventional commercial patch antenna in order then to arrange the electrically conductive patch face on the upper side of this additional dielectric carrying layer. A different, but also highly complex, construction would involve, for example, equipping an antenna housing, below which a conventional commercial patch antenna is integrated, with an additional electrically conductive patch face; however, this would also require complex additional constructional measures.<br>
in view of the foregoing, the object of the present invention is to provide an improved multilayer antenna of planar construction, in particular a patch antenna, which, to achieve the electrical characteristics known per se, is provided with a patch radiator provided above the radiation face and which is also of simpler overall construction and/or has improved electrical characteristics.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in accordance with the features specified in Claim 1. Advantageous configurations of the invention are recited in the sub-claims.<br>
The solution according to the invention allows numerous advantages to be achieved.<br>
A basic advantage (and one that is highly surprising) is that the antenna according to the invention has significantly improved antenna characteristics compared to<br>
simple, normal patch antennas. This is all the more surprising in view of the fact that the radiation structure provided at the very top of the patch antenna is arranged at an extremely small distance above the radiation face of the patch antenna and may therefore, in a preferred embodiment, even have longitudinal and transverse extensions which are greater than the radiation face located therebelow. After all, in such a case, the uppermost patch face would be expected adversely to influence the radiation pattern.<br>
A further basic advantage of the antenna according to the invention is that conventional commercial patch antennas having a ground face and a radiation face and a dielectric located therebetween - preferably, for example, what are known as ceramic patch antennas - may be easily used without having to be constructionally altered. All that is required is to fasten the three-dimensional electrically conductive structure of the uppermost patch face to a conventional commercial patch antenna using a suitable adhesion and/or fastening layer.<br>
In other words, an additional carrier structure or hood is not required in order to hold this patch face.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an adhesion layer, in the form of a double-sided adhesive tape or in the form of a comparable adhesion means, is used as an adhesion structure between a conventional commercial patch antenna and the uppermost conductive three-dimensional patch element, allowing simple fastening of the uppermost patch element to a conventional patch antenna.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the distance between the three-dimensional patch element and the radiation face of a patch antenna is greater than 0.5 mm, in particular greater than 1 mm, for example about<br>
1.5 mm. Although the distance may be even greater, such a small distance between the three-dimensional patch element and the radiation face of a multilayer patch antenna is, in principle, entirely sufficient.<br>
The three-dimensional structure of the patch element may,<br>
for example, be provided by what is known as a volume<br>
member which, in addition to its two-dimensional extension<br>
(comparable, for example, to conventional metal plates or<br>
metal layers), also has a significantly greater height or<br>
thickness of one or more millimetres.<br>
However, alternatively, it is also possible, for example, for a three-dimensional patch element of this type, arranged above the radiation face, to be equipped with a wholly or partially peripheral edge or web edge, providing effectively a three-dimensional structure. This opens up the possibility for the patch element provided with a three-dimensional structure to be formed by a metal sheet or punched part in which edge portions, which revolve from a two-dimensional element and are oriented transversely and preferably perpendicularly to the plane of the patch element, are upwardly positioned. In the corners, the individual flange or edge portions do not necessarily have to be electrically or electrogalvanically connected to one another. The given electrical connection of a positioned edge element to an adjacent edge element is provided via the central portion, oriented substantially parallel to the radiation and ground face located therebelow, of the patch element.<br>
The aforementioned three-dimensional structure (which is referred to as a "three-dimensional" structure because it has a significantly greater material thickness or material height than metal plates or metal foils used according to the prior art) does not necessarily require the entire member to be configured as what is known as a volume<br>
member or the aforementioned peripheral edge necessarily to encircle the entire edge portion of the patch structure. Edge or web elements provided only in certain sections are also sufficient. Recesses or even, for example, a concave deformation of the patch face facing the radiation face located therebelow may also be provided in the patch face itself. However, recesses, which protrude, for example, from the peripheral edge into the patch face, may also be formed in the patch face.<br>
Also possible is the use, for example, of a dielectric member which is made from plastics material and is coated with an electrically conductive layer. On use of a "volume member" of this type having a thickness or height of, for example, more than preferably 0.5 mm or 1 mm, in particular more than 1.5 mm, said member should be provided, at least on a side located parallel to the radiation face, preferably on the side located adjacent to the radiation face and on its peripheral wall or edge portions, with an electrically conductive layer. The upper side, remote from the radiation face of the patch antenna, of the electrically non-conductive member may also, if required, be equipped with an electrically conductive layer.<br>

respect thereto and stimulated via a supply line, a patch face arranged above, and laterally offset with respect to, the radiation face. The carrier material between .the ground face and the radiation face and also between the radiation face and the patch face located thereabove consists, in each case, of a substrate having a uniform dielectric constant.<br>
A patch antenna comprising carrier layers having different dielectric constants has become known, for example, from the prior publication IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 47, NO. 12, DECEMBER 1999, pages 1780 to 1784. Foam is used as the upper carrier layer for the upper metallic face (patch face). The distance between the upper patch face and the radiation face located therebelow corresponds to the distance between the radiation face and the lower ground face.<br>
The prior publication IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 47, NO. 12, DECEMBER 1999, pages 1767 to 1771, among other documents, demonstrates that antenna gain may be increased using multilayer patch antennas.<br>
In addition, a further antenna having a multilayer construction has become known, for example, from US 5,880,694 A. The antenna comprises a lower ground face, a dielectric carrying member located thereon and having a radiator face located on its upper side. Above the radiator face there is arranged a further dielectric member on which there is provided, on the side remote from the lower ground face, an electrically conductive patch face.<br>
A strip conductor antenna with a matching array has in addition become known from EP 1 376 758 Al. This prior publication describes a broad range of exemplary embodiments for strip conductor antenna arrangements. One<br>
exemplary embodiment describes a strip conductor antenna having via a ground face a stepped substrate with at least one upwardly protruding, panel-like projection. Provided below this panel-like projection, adjacent to the ground face, is a recess in the foam substrate, a strip conductor 6 being provided on the upper periphery of said recess. The stepped raised projection, provided in the centre, produces steps which are lowered at two opposing sides and as a result stepped shoulders which are positioned closer to the ground face and are provided, jointly with the upper projection, with an electrically conductive layer.<br>
A drawback of all previously known antenna arrangements of this type is the comparatively complex construction. For, in the use of conventional commercial patch antennas having a ground face, an electric carrying member (substrate) located thereon and a radiation face located thereabove, it is invariably complex to supplement an antenna of this type to form a multilayer antenna. Depending on the use of conventional commercial patch antennas, which comprise at least a lower ground face, a substrate made from a dielectric material, for example ceramics, and a radiation face located thereon, a dielectric carrier layer, possibly of variable thickness, would then have to be produced in each case and, for example, positioned and secured on the radiation face of the conventional commercial patch antenna in order then to arrange the electrically conductive patch face on the upper side of this additional dielectric carrying layer. A different, but also highly complex, construction would involve, for example, equipping an antenna housing, below which a conventional commercial patch antenna is integrated, with an additional electrically conductive patch face; however, this would also require complex additional constructional measures.<br>

The solution according to the invention allows numerous advantages to be achieved.<br>
A basic advantage (and one that is highly surprising) is<br>
that the antenna according to the invention has<br>
significantly improved antenna characteristics compared to<br>
simple, normal patch antennas. This is all the more<br>
surprising in view of the fact that the radiation<br>
structure provided at the very top of the patch antenna is<br>
arranged at an extremely small distance above the<br>
radiation face of the patch antenna and may therefore, in<br>
a preferred embodiment, even have longitudinal and<br>
transverse extensions which are greater than the radiation<br>
face located therebelow. After all, in such a case, the<br>
uppermost patch face would be expected adversely to<br>
influence the radiation pattern.<br>
A further basic advantage of the antenna according to the invention is that conventional commercial patch antennas having a ground face and a radiation face and a dielectric located therebetween - preferably, for example, what are known as ceramic patch antennas - may be easily used without having to be constructionally altered. All that is<br>
required is to fasten the three-dimensional electrically conductive structure of the uppermost patch face to a conventional commercial patch antenna using a suitable adhesion and/or fastening layer.<br>
In other words, an additional carrier structure or hood is not required in order to hold this patch face.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an adhesion layer, in the form of a double-sided adhesive tape or in the form of a comparable adhesion means, is used as an adhesion structure between a conventional commercial patch antenna and the uppermost conductive three-dimensional patch element, allowing simple fastening of the uppermost patch element to a conventional patch antenna.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the distance between the three-dimensional patch element and the radiation face of a patch antenna is greater than 0.5 mm, in particular greater than 1 mm, for example about 1.5 mm. Although the distance may be even greater, such a small distance between the three-dimensional patch element and the radiation face of a multilayer patch antenna is, in principle, entirely sufficient.<br>
The three-dimensional structure of the patch element may, for example, be provided by what is known as a volume member which, in addition to its two-dimensional extension (comparable, for example, to conventional metal plates or metal layers), also has a significantly greater height or thickness of one or more millimetres.<br>
However, alternatively, it is also possible, for example, for a three-dimensional patch element of this type, arranged above the radiation face, to be equipped with a wholly or partially peripheral edge or web edge, providing effectively a three-dimensional structure. This opens up<br>
the possibility for the patch element provided with a three-dimensional structure to be formed by a metal sheet or punched part in which edge portions, which revolve from a two-dimensional element and are oriented transversely<br>
5 and preferably perpendicularly to the plane of the patch element, are upwardly positioned. In the corners, the individual flange or edge portions do not necessarily have to be electrically or electrogalvanically connected to one another. The given electrical connection of a positioned<br>
) edge element to an adjacent edge element is provided via the central portion, oriented substantially parallel to the radiation and ground face located therebelow, of the patch element.<br>
The aforementioned three-dimensional structure (which is referred to as a "three-dimensional" structure because it has a significantly greater material thickness or material height than metal plates or metal foils used according to the prior art) does not necessarily require the entire member to be configured as what is known as a volume member or the aforementioned peripheral edge necessarily to encircle the entire edge portion of the patch structure. Edge or web elements provided only in certain sections are also sufficient. Recesses or even, for example, a concave deformation of the patch face facing the radiation face located therebelow may also be provided in the patch face itself. However, recesses, which protrude, for example, from the peripheral edge into the patch face, may also be formed in the patch face.<br>

The upper side, remote from the radiation face of the patch antenna, of the electrically non-conductive member may also, if required, be equipped with an electrically conductive layer.<br>

Fig. 11 shows an embodiment further differing from Fig. 7, 9a, 9b and 10; and<br>
5 Fig. 12 shows a further modified embodiment in which the height or thickness of the patch element is significantly greater.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic side view and Fig. 2 a schematic<br>
1 plan view of the basic construction of a conventional commercial patch radiator A (patch antenna) which in Fig. 4.3 ff. is extended to form a multilayer patch antenna (stacked patch antenna).<br>
The patch antenna shown in Fig. 1 and 2 comprises a plurality of faces and layers which are arranged one above the other along an axial axis Z and will be considered hereinafter.<br>
It is apparent from the schematic sectional view according to Fig. 1 that the patch antenna A has on what is known as its lower or attachment side 1 an electrically conductive ground face 3. Arranged on the ground face 3, or laterally offset with respect thereto, is a dielectric carrier 5 which, in plan view, conventionally has an outer contour 5' corresponding to the outer contour 3' of the ground face 3. However, this dielectric carrier 5 may also be<br>
larger or smaller in its configuration and/or be provided with an outer contour 5' differing from the outer contour 3' of the ground face 3. In general, the outer contour 3' of the ground face may be n-polygonal and/or even be i provided with sinuous portions or be sinuous in its configuration, although this is unconventional.<br>
This dielectric carrier 5 has a sufficient height or thickness, which generally corresponds to a multiple of the thickness of the ground face 3; i.e., in contrast to the ground face 3, which basically consists merely of a two-dimensional face, this dielectric carrier 5 is configured as a three-dimensional member having sufficient height and thickness.<br>
On the upper side 5a opposing the lower side 5b (which becomes adjacent to the ground face 3) there is configured an electrically conductive radiation face 7 which may, again, also basically be understood as a two-dimensional face. This radiation face 7 is supplied with electricity and stimulated via a supply line 9 which preferably extends in the transverse direction, in particular perpendicularly to the radiation face 7, from below, through the dielectric carrier 5 in a corresponding bore or a corresponding channel 5c.<br>
From a connection point 11, which is generally located at the bottom and to which a coaxial cable (not shown in greater detail) may be connected, the inner conductor of the coaxial cable (not shown) is electrogalvanically connected to the supply line 9, and is therefore connected to the radiation face 7. The outer conductor of the coaxial cable (not shown) is then electrogalvanically connected to the ground face 3 located at the bottom.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 1 ff. is a patch antenna having a dielectric 5 and a square shape in plan view.<br>
This shape or the corresponding contour or outline 5' may, however, also be non-square and, in general, be an n-polygonal shape. Sinuous outer boundaries may even be provided, although this is unconventional.<br>
The radiation face 7 resting on the dielectric 5 may have the same contour or outline 7' as the dielectric 5 located therebelow. In the illustrated embodiment, the basic shape is also square in its formation (in adaptation to the outline 5' of the dielectric 5) but has, at two opposing ends, flat portions 7" which are formed practically by the omission of an isosceles-rectangular triangle. In general, the outline 7' may therefore also be an n-polygonal outline or contour or even be provided with a sinuous outer boundary 7'.<br>
The aforementioned ground face 3 and also the radiation face 7 are described in certain respects as being "two-dimensional" faces, since their thickness is so low that they can hardly be described as being "volume members". The thickness of the ground face and the radiation face 3, 7 is conventionally below 1 mm, i.e. generally below 0.5 mm, in particular below 0.25 mm, 0.20 mm, 0.10 mm.<br>
Above the patch antenna A thus formed, which may, for example, consist of a conventional commercial patch antenna A, preferably of what is known as a ceramic patch antenna (in which, that is, the dielectric carrier layer 5 is made from a ceramic material) , there is then additionally arranged, in the case of a stacked patch antenna of the invention according to Fig. 3 and 4, offset in terms of height with respect to the upper radiation face 7, a patch element 13 (Fig. 3) which, compared to the aforementioned ground face 3 and the radiation face 7, has a three-dimensional structure having a significantly different, i.e. greater, height or thickness.<br>
The stacked patch antenna thus described is, for example,<br>
positioned on a chassis B (illustrated in Fig. 3 merely as<br>
a line) which may, for example, be the base chassis for a<br>
motor vehicle antenna, in which the antenna according to<br>
the invention, optionally in addition to further antennas<br>
for other services, may be integrated. For example, the<br>
stacked patch antenna according to the invention may, in<br>
particular, be used as an antenna for geostationary<br>
positioning and/or for the reception of satellite or<br>
terrestrial signals, for example from what is known as the<br>
SDAR service. However, this does not entail any limitation<br>
to use for other services as well.<br>
The patch element 13 may, for example, consist of an electrically conductive metallic member, i.e., for example, a cuboid having appropriate longitudinal and transverse extensions and sufficient height and thickness.<br>
As is apparent from the plan view according to Fig. 4, this patch element 13 may, however, also have an outline 13' differing from a rectangular or square structure. That is to say, as is known, the patch antenna may be further adapted in certain respects by the working-off of edge regions 14, for example of corner regions 13a apparent in Fig. 4.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the patch element 13 has a longitudinal extension and a transverse extension which, on the one hand, are greater than the longitudinal and transverse extensions of the radiation face 7 and/or, on the other hand, are also greater than the longitudinal and transverse extensions of the dielectric carrier 5 and/or of the ground face 3 located therebelow.<br>
In very general terms, the patch element 13 may also have, entirely or in part, convex or concave and/or other sinuous outlines or an n-polygonal outline, or mixed forms<br>
of both, as is shown in plan view, purely schematically, for a differing embodiment according to Fig. 5, the patch element 13 in this case having a non-uniform outer contour or a non-uniform outline 13'.<br>
The patch element 13 has a thickness which is not only double, three, four or five times, etc., but rather above all ten times, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and/or 100 and more times the thickness of the ground face 3 and/or the thickness of the radiation face 7.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the thickness or height 114 of the patch element 13 is equal to or greater than a spacing 17 formed by the lower side 13b of the patch element 13 and the upper side 7a of the radiation face 7.<br>
On the other hand, this spacing 17 should also not be less than 0.5 mm, preferably greater than 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, or equal to or greater than 1 mm. Values about 1.5 mm, i.e. generally between 1 mm and 2 mm or 1 mm and 3 mm, 4 mm or 5 mm are entirely sufficient.<br>
On the other hand, it should also be noted that the height or thickness 114 of the three-dimensional patch element 13 is preferably less than the height or thickness 15 of the dielectric carrier 5. The uppermost patch element 13 preferably has a thickness or height 114 corresponding to less than 90%, in particular less than 80%, 70%, 60%, 50% or even less than 40% and optionally 30% or less than 20% of the height or thickness 15 of the carrier element 5.<br>
On the other hand, the abovementioned height does not necessarily have to be prerestricted. The height or thickness 114 of the three-dimensional patch element 13 may also therefore be greater, and above all significantly greater, than the thickness of the dielectric carrier 5. In other words, the carrier element 5 may, for example,<br>
have a height or thickness 15 corresponding to up to 1.5 times, twice, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and/or ten and more times the height or thickness 15 of the carrier element 5.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness or height 114 of the patch element 13 should preferably be greater than the distance 17 between the radiation face 7 and the lower side 13b of the patch element 13.<br>
A carrying means 19, in particular a dielectric carrying means 19 having a height 17, via which the patch element 13 is held and carried, is preferably used between the radiation face 7 and the lower side 13B of the patch element 13 (i.e. for the distance 17). This dielectric carrying means 19 preferably consists of an adhesion or mounting layer 19' (Fig. 6) which may, for example, be configured as what is known as a double-sided adhesive adhesion and mounting layer 19'. Conventional commercial double-sided adhesive tapes or double-sided adhesive foam tapes, adhesive pads or the like, which have an appropriate, abovementioned thickness, may be used for this purpose. This opens up the simple possibility of fastening and mounting in this way the aforementioned patch element 13 on the upper side of a conventional commercial patch antenna, in particular a conventional commercial ceramic patch antenna.<br>
However, instead of the electrically fully conductive metallic member as the patch element 13, a plastics material member, which is provided, for example, with an electrically conductive lower side 13b and electrically conductive peripheral lateral boundaries 13c, may, for example, also be used, for example by applying an electrically conductive outer layer. The upper side 13d does not necessarily have to be electrically conductive, although the entire surface of the patch element 13 thus<br>
formed, which is per se non-conductive, may be provided with a peripheral electrically conductive layer.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a modification in which the three-dimensional patch element 13 is configured not as a volume member but rather as a plate-type patch element 13 provided with a peripheral lateral or edge web 14.<br>
A patch element 13 of this type may, for example, be made from a metal sheet by punching and edging as illustrated, for example, in plan view in Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the outlines of a metal part, for example having an approximately square shape, corners 25 having been punched out in the corner regions. The edge regions or webs 14 thus formed may then be positioned along the edge lines 27, opposing the base 113 of the patch element 13, so these edge regions or webs 14 extend transversely to the base 113 of the patch element 13 and preferably perpendicularly thereto. The lines of intersection thus formed between two edge webs 14, located adjacent to one another in the circumferential direction and extending perpendicularly to one another in the illustrated embodiment, do not have to be electrogalvanically interconnected, for example by soldering, at their lines of intersection and/or contact. The electrical connection via the two-dimensional central portion 113 of the patch element 13 is sufficient.<br>
In this case, too, the lower side 13b of the patch element 13 thus formed is fastened to the upper side of a, for example conventional commercial, patch antenna A using a carrying means, for example using a layered dielectric carrying means 19, preferably in the form of an adhesion or mounting carrier 19', wherein a conventional commercial patch antenna A may also, but does not have to, be coated<br>
with a dielectric layer on the upper side of its radiation face 7.<br>
Fig. 9a shows in schematic cross section and Fig. 9b in schematic plan view that the patch element 13 described, by way of example, with reference to Fig. 7 and 8 may be provided in its two-dimensional lower side 13b with a recess or a hole 29. This recess or this hole 29 is preferably provided in the region in which the supply line 9 is connected to the radiation face 7, generally by soldering. For, a soldered elevation 31 protruding beyond the surface of the radiation face 7 is conventionally configured at this point. Even if only a very thin carrying means 19, preferably in the form of an adhesion or mounting carrier 19', is used, this ensures that, firstly, a good mechanical adhesive connection may be produced between the patch element 13, via the carrying means 19, preferably in the form of the adhesion or mounting layer 19', and the, generally conventional commercial, patch antenna located therebelow and, secondly, electrical contacting between the soldered elevation 31 and the patch element 13 may be reliably prevented. For the sake of clarity, the carrying means 19, preferably in the form of an adhesion and/or mounting layer 19', has not been illustrated in Fig. 9a (and also in Fig. 10 and 11, discussed hereinafter). For the sake of clarity, in Fig. 9b, the upper patch 13 is shown to be almost "transparent", so the aforementioned recess or the hole 29 is denoted merely by a corresponding outline.<br>
Similar advantages may also be achieved according to a configuration corresponding to Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, a deformation 33, which protrudes in an upwardly convex manner and preferably comes to rest above the electrically conductive connection between the supply line 9 and the supply face 7, i.e. generally where a soldered elevation<br>
31 is formed, is integrated in the electrically conductive lower plane 13b of the patch element 13.<br>
Finally, Fig. 11 merely shows that the aforementioned edge portions 14, which, in the illustrated embodiments, are each provided at the peripheral outer edge 113' of the patch face of the patch element 13, do not have to be oriented perpendicularly to the base 113 of the patch element 13 but may also, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 11, be provided at an angular orientation differing from the perpendicular. In the embodiment according to Fig. 11, the edge lateral boundaries 14 diverge along the axial attachment direction A (in Fig. 1), i.e. are oriented extending away from one another, from the base or central face 113 in the direction of radiation. However, the edge lateral portions may equally be oriented facing one another. Equally, on one side, the lateral boundaries 14 may, for example, be curved in the other direction A, more toward the central portion 113 of the patch 13, and, on the other side, be oriented extending away from the central face 113. Finally, these webs or edge portions 14 do not necessarily have to be provided on the outermost outline edge 113' but may rather be located further inwardly offset, as indicated, by way of example, by broken lines in Fig. 11 for webs extending transversely to the base 113 or other types of elevations 14' which are arranged on the patch element so as to be further inwardly offset with respect to the outer boundary 113'. However, these webs or elevations 14' shown in Fig. 11 may also be oriented extending non-perpendicularly, inclined more outwardly or more inwardly. Furthermore, they also do not have to be web or band-shaped in cross section but may rather have a voluminous triangular cross section or any other sectional shapes.<br>
Finally, it should also be noted that on use of a volume member, too - comparable, for example, to the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 3 or 6 - the peripheral boundary faces 13' (lateral boundaries 13c) do not have to be oriented perpendicularly to the lower or upper side 13b, 13d of the patch element 13 but may rather also be configured with i lateral faces extending obliquely - comparable to the inclined extending edges or webs 14 in Fig. 11.<br>
The stacked patch antenna according to the invention may preferably be used as an antenna within the context of a motor vehicle antenna, in addition to further antennas for other services. However, this does not entail any limitation to such uses. The conventional commercial patch antenna A used within the context of this stacked patch antenna according to the invention preferably consists -as stated - of a dielectric carrier 5, the upper or lower side of which consists of a metallic or electrically conductive layer 7 or 3 and is fixed to the carrier 5.<br>
Finally, reference is also made to Fig. 12, which illustrates a further embodiment. This embodiment uses an upper patch element 13 which - as is apparent from the Figure - has a thickness or height 114 which is even greater than the thickness or height of the dielectric carrier 5. Despite this comparatively great height or the relatively great extension perpendicular to the substrate face, the patch antenna thus formed also has improved electrical characteristics.<br>
It has been illustrated with reference to the described exemplary embodiments that the patch element 13 is larger than or the same size as the dielectric carrier 5. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the patch element 13 is also larger than the ground face 3 and larger than the radiation face 7.<br>
Size particulars will be specified hereinafter with regard to the patch element 13 in relation to the dielectric carrier 5, to the ground face 3 or to the radiation face 7, wherein the subsequent size particulars and size ratios relate in each case to a direction of extension in the longitudinal and/or transverse direction of the patch element 13, the carrier 5, the ground face 3 and the radiation face 7 (in particular parallel to the two edge lengths, positioned perpendicularly one on the other, of the aforementioned parts), i.e. reproduce linear size ratios and not two-dimensional size ratios.<br>
Preferably, the arrangement should be selected in such a way that the patch element 13 is up to 100 % larger than the dielectric carrier 5 and/or up to 200 % larger than the ground face 3 and/or up to 200 % larger than the radiation face 7.<br>
In a further preferred variant, the orders of magnitude<br>
can alternatively or additionally also be selected in such<br>
a way that the patch element (which is generally larger<br>
than the dielectric carrier 5) is intended to have a<br>
minimum size which is 20 % smaller than the dielectric<br>
carrier 5 and/or is up to 5 % smaller than the ground face<br>
3 and/or is up to 5 % smaller than the radiation face 7.<br>
Conventionally, the corresponding orders of magnitude are<br>
however larger than the lowest values mentioned<br>
hereinbefore.<br>
Preferred values are for example such that the patch element 13 is larger than the electric carrier 5 by 4 % to 16 %, in particular by 6 % to 12 % and in particular by 8 %, and/or that the patch element 13 is larger than the<br>
ground face 3 by 8 % to 34 % and in particular by 12 % to<br>
28 %, namely by 17 %, and/or is larger than the radiation<br>
face 7 by 21 % to 84 %, in particular by 30 % to 60 %, above all by 42 %.<br>
