Certain a-amino acid derivatives having a different kind of structure have already been<br>
proposed for the control of plant-destructive fungi (for example in EP-398 072, EP-425925, DE-40 26 966, EP-477 639, EP-493 683, DE-40 35 851, EP-487 154, EP-496239, EP-550 788 and EP-554729). Those compositions are not, however, satisfactory in their action. Surprisingly, with the compound structure of formula I, new kinds of microbicides having a high activity have been found.<br><br>
Description of the process for the preparation of compounds according to the invention The compounds of formula I can be prepared by one of the following processes :<br>
a)<br><br>
Step B: An amino acid of formula II or a carboxy-activated derivative of an amino acid of formula II, where Ri, n, R2 and R3 have the meaning as defined above, is reacted with an amine of the formula V where A and B have the meaning as defined above, optionally in the presence of a base and optionally in the presence of a diluting agent. Any cariboxy-activated derivatives are suitable as carboxy-activated derivatives of the amino acid of formula II, such as acid halides, for example acid chlorides or fluorides; symmetrical or mixed anhydrides, for example the mixed O-alkylcarboxylic acid anhydrides; activated esters, for example p-nitrophenyl esters or N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, and activated forms of the amino acid II produced in situ using condensation agents (e.g. dicydohexylcartbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, 0-(benzotriaz-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-bis(pentamethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, 0-(ben2otriaz-1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-bls(tetramethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, (benzotriazoM -yloxy)-tripyrroiidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate, (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate or 0-(benzotriazoM-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyiuronium hexafluorophosphate).<br>
The acid halides corresponding to the amino acid of formula II can be prepared by reacting the amino add of formula II in a manner known perse with a halogenating agent, for example phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, cyanuric fluoride or diethylaminosulf ur trif luoride.<br><br>
The mixed anhydrides corresponding to the amino acid of formula 11 can be prepared by reacting the amino acid of formula II with chloroformic acid esters, for example chloroformic acid alkyl esters, preferably chlorofomiic acid isobutyl ester, in the absence or presence of an acid-binding agent, such as an inorganic or organic base, for example a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylpiperidine or N-methylmorpholine.<br>
Step A: The compounds of formula II can be prepared by reaction of an amino acid of fonmula IV where R2 and R3 have the same meanings as defined above with a sulfonyl halide or a sulfinyl halide of fomiula III where Ri and n have the meanings as defined above and where X is halide, preferentially chlorine or bromine. The reaction is optionally performed in a solvent and in presence of a base.<br><br>
Step C: The compounds of formula I can also be prepared by reaction of an amino acid derivative of formula VI where R2, R3, A and B have the same meanings as defined above with a sulfonyl halide or a sulfinyl halide of formula III where R1 and n have the same meanings as defined above and where X is halide, preferentially chlorine or bromine. The reaction is performed in the same manner as described for step A.<br>
c) The compounds of the formula I, wherein n is 1 can be prepared by oxidizing compounds of formula I wherein n = 0 (I') with organic oxidizing agents, such as alkyl hydroperoxides, for example cumyl hydroperoxide, and inorganic oxidizing agents, such as peroxides, for example hydrogen peroxide, or transition metal oxides, for example chromium trioxide, and transition metal oxide salts, for example potassium permanganate, potassium or sodium dichromate, are suitable oxidizing agents.<br>
The reaction of the compounds of formula r with the oxidizing agents takes place in an inert diluent, such as water or a ketone, for example acetone, or in mixtures thereof, in the absence or presence of an add or in the eibsence or presence of a base, at temperatures of from-80to+15(y1C.<br><br><br>
step D: An isocyanlde of formula VII, where A and B are as defined before (see D.Seebach. G.Adam, T.Gees, M.Schless, W.Weigang, Chem.Ber., 1988,121,507) Is reacted with a known compound of formula VIII (R2 and R3 are as defined before), a known compound of formula IX (Rio is lower alkyl or H) and ammonia in a solvent (typically an alcohol as methanol or ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, methylenchloride) at a temperature between -20"and +150°C , optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid, typically ZnCl2 (Ugi reaction).<br>
Step E: A compound of formula X, where R2, R3, R10, A and B are as defined before, is hydrolysed under acidic or basic conditions at a temperature between 0"and 100X. Typical acids are mineral acids as HCI, H2SO4, organic acids as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid; typical bases are NaOH, KOH, Ba(0H)2, carbonates, triethylamine, ethyl diisopropylamine; typical solvents are alcohols like ethanoi or methanol, tetrahydrofurane, dimethylfomriamide, dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
Compound VI can be converted to compounds of formula I by step C as described under process b).<br>
The invention relates also to the amino acid derivatives of formula VI, wherein R2, R3, A and B have the meaning as defined for formula L<br><br>
The sulfonic acid or sulfinto acid or the sulfonic or sulfinic acid derivative of formula III required for process a) or b) and the amino acids of formula IV required for process a) are known perse.<br>
Suitable sulfonic or sulfinic acid derivatives of formula III are any compounds wherein Z is a leaving group, such as sulfonic acid halides or sulfinic acid halides, e.g. sulfochlorides or sulfinic acid chlorides; symmetrical or mixed anhydrides; and activated forms of sulfonic acid or sulfinic acid produced in situ using condensation agents, such as dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide or carbonyldiimidazole.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous biocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy pests occurring on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later, for example, also remain protected against phytopathogenic fungi. The novel compounds of formula I prove to be preferentially effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfect! (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Bremia, Pythium, Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredients, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agri  cultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mbced with one or more of the substances or groups of substances herein described. Also included is a method for the treatment of plants which comprises applying the novel compounds of formula I or the novel compositions.<br><br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum, spelt, triticale and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackbenies); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas and soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans and groundnuts); cucumber plants (marrows, cucumbers and melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp and jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit and mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and paprika); lauraceae (avocados, cinnamon and camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally applied In the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with further active ingredients. Those further active ingredients may be fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides, and insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants may be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, such as, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binding agents or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described In WO 97/33890.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula I, or an agrochemical composition comprising at least one of those compounds, Is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application depending upon the risk of infestation by the pathogen in question. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to propagation material (grains, fruits, tubers, shoots, cuttings, roots etc.) (dressing), for example either by impregnating cereal grains (seeds) or potato tubers or freshly cut shoots with a liquid formulation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid formulation.<br><br>
