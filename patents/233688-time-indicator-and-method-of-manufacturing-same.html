				<td>TIME INDICATOR AND METHOD OP MANUFACTURING SAME<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an indicator for<br>
showing the product lifetime of the item to which said<br>
indicator is attached. More particularly the present<br>
invention relates to an indicator which, on activation by<br>
applying pressure, measures elapsed time and displays visual<br>
indications relating to the product lifetime of the item to<br>
which it is attached.<br>
The need to monitor the lifetime of food and drug<br>
products is well known, especially where such products<br>
deteriorate rapidly after manufacturing or opening. Milk-<br>
based products deteriorate rapidly from the time of<br>
manufacture, and many types of long-life products (such a<br>
canned produce) need to be disposed of within days of<br>
opening. Thus, a typical home environment needs a means of<br>
monitoring the freshness of the products in the refrigerator.<br>
In particular, in situations in which a can is opened or a<br>
foodstuff prepared but not consumed immediately in its<br>
entirety, the remains will often be placed in a container in<br>
the refrigerator. In the absence of a simple aid to show the<br>
consumer how long any such container has been in the<br>
refrigerator, the danger exists that said remains will<br>
deteriorate and pose a health risk. Alternatively, being<br>
unaware of how long this package has been in the<br>
refrigerator, ~ the over-cautious consumer may dispose of the<br>
contents before this becomes necessary. In either case, the<br>
need for a simple, inexpensive and reliable indicator or tag<br>
for such containers in the refrigerator is clear.<br>
A number of means to accomplish this objective are well<br>
known in the art. Co-pending application WO 01/26993,<br>
describes a cap containing an integral lifetime indicator<br>
where the first opening of the cap causes the activation of<br>
the lifetime indicator. However, this approach does not<br>
assist the consumer who is preparing a container of *left-<br>
overs" within the consumer's premises. Similarly, US patents<br>
4,292,916; 5,053,339,- 5,446,705 and 5,633,835 describe colour<br>
changing devices for monitoring the shelf-life of perishable<br>
products. These devices are initiated by physically bringing<br>
into contact reactive layers so that a chemical reaction<br>
between them will start, and this action can only<br>
conveniently be performed at the time of initial<br>
manufacturing. While this approach ia suitable for<br>
monitoring the degradation of foodstuffs throughout the<br>
entire distribution chain, they are unsuitable for user<br>
activation and application within the home environment.<br>
Further prior art addresses issues associated with applying<br>
such devices during the manufacturing and packaging<br>
processes. US Patent 5,555,223 describes a process for<br>
attaching timing indicators to packaging, including the step<br>
of setting the timer's clock at the exact time of production.<br>
Thus the above prior art devices require special<br>
manufacturing steps at the product ion-end of the packaging<br>
and filling processes, rather than the end-user affixation<br>
and activation of a lifetime indicator at the time of use or<br>
of storage as envisaged in the current invention. Similarly,<br>
time-temperature indicators (TTIs) also address the task of<br>
monitoring the entire distribution chain, rather than<br>
providing an end-user solution. A number of liquid migration<br>
technologies are known in the art, but these typically rely<br>
either on the rapid wicking of paper and are thus good for<br>
time ranges in the minutes to hours range, or require complex<br>
fabrication of the migration media from materials such as<br>
gelatine or other gels in order to provide for slower<br>
migration, and are thus both complex and expensive to<br>
produce.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a time indicator<br>
comprises a first reservoir, a migration medium and<br>
activating means for bringing liquid from the first reservoir<br>
in contact with the migration medium so that after activation<br>
the liquid migrates through the migration medium producing a<br>
colour change therein, characterised in that the activating<br>
means comprises a second reservoir connected between the<br>
first reservoir and the migration medium whereby after<br>
activation the liquid travels relatively rapidly from the<br>
first reservoir to the second reservoir and then migrates<br>
relatively slowly along the length of the migration medium<br>
over time.<br>
As the liquid slowly migrates along the length of the<br>
migration medium, a visual indication of the time elapsed is<br>
given by the cumulative progress of the colour change. The<br>
time indicator may comprise indicia whereby the time elapsed.<br>
is measured by comparing the progress of the colour change<br>
along the migration medium with the indicia.<br>
The presence of the second reservoir allows for rapid<br>
dispersion of the liquid away from the first reservoir. This<br>
may reduce the risk of the device leaking when the liquid is<br>
forced out of the first reservoir. Furthermore, the accuracy<br>
of the measurement of elapsed time may also be improved since<br>
the measurement depends only on the nature of the migration<br>
medium and- liquid and is independent of the initial flow of<br>
the liquid from the first reservoir.<br>
The second reservoir may take the form of an internal<br>
cavity or chamber within the body of the time indicator, an<br>
inflatable pocket which inflates after activation or an<br>
absorption medium which absorbs the liquid after activation.<br>
The first and second reservoirs may be connected by a conduit<br>
which may include a material which allows rapid wieking of<br>
the liquid from the first reservoir to the second reservoir<br>
after activation. The first and second reservoirs may be<br>
located towards opposed ends of the migration medium or may<br>
be located towards the same end.<br>
The first reservoir may be housed within the second<br>
reservoir/ for example, the first reservoir may be in the<br>
form of a rupturable liquid capsule located within a cavity<br>
which, forms the second reservoir. Activating the time<br>
indicator causes the capsule to rupture releasing liquid into<br>
the cavity.<br>
The time indicator is preferably adapted, for example by<br>
appropriate selection of the properties of the liquid and the<br>
migration medium, so that the migration along the migration<br>
medium takes a predetermined time period. The time period may<br>
be between thirty minutes and six months, particularly in the<br>
days to weeks range. For example, for a time indicator for<br>
use with dairy products, the time period may be in the region<br>
of two to five days. Alternatively, for a time indicator for<br>
use with canned or bottled cooking sauces, the time period<br>
may be in the region of one to two weeks. Further examples<br>
include eye ointments or nasal sprays which may necessitate a<br>
time period of one month, filters, e.g. water filters, which<br>
may necessitate a time period of one to three months, cold<br>
meats or baby foods which may necessitate a time period of<br>
three to seven days or twenty-four to forty eight hours<br>
respectively.<br>
The activating means may be pressure activated, for<br>
example, applying pressure to the first reservoir may force<br>
liquid from the first reservoir into the second reservoir.<br>
The activating means may comprise a pressure-rupturable seal<br>
separating the first reservoir from the second reservoir and<br>
hence separating the first reservoir from the migration<br>
medium.<br>
The time indicator may comprise a base layer which may<br>
be formed with a dished portion for the first reservoir, a<br>
migration layer comprising the migration medium and an<br>
intermediate layer sandwiched between the base layer and the<br>
migration layer. Each layer and the migration medium may be<br>
sheet-like, for example, having the following<br>
characteristics, thin and flexible. The intermediate layer<br>
may be weakly adhered to the migration layer at one end of<br>
the migration medium whereby the second reservoir is formed<br>
between the upper and intermediate layers after activation.<br>
The second reservoir may in this way be an inflatable pocket.<br>
The time indicator may comprise an at least partially<br>
transparent layer mounted to the migration medium or<br>
migration layer. The at least partially transparent layer may<br>
be in the form of a partially transparent mask. The mask may<br>
comprise one or more transparent windows through which the<br>
colour change is visible. The transparent windows may act as<br>
indicia for measuring the progress of the colour change- One<br>
of the indicia may be arranged so that in conjunction with<br>
the second reservoir, it provides an indication that the<br>
device has been activated. For example, a first transparent<br>
window may be aligned above the second reservoir. The<br>
transparent windows may be defined by printing directly on<br>
the migration medium or migration layer which simplifies the<br>
manufacture of the time indicator. The migration medium or<br>
layer may be laminated to allow for printing thereon.<br>
The colour change may be from any other colour to red.<br>
The migration of the liquid may cause more than one, e.g. two<br>
or multiple, colour change in the migration medium. For<br>
example, the colour change may have an intermediate colour of<br>
yellow prior to the appearance of a red colour.<br>
The liquid may be coloured, whereby a visually<br>
observable colour change is produced in the migration medium<br>
by the migration of the liquid into pores in the migration<br>
medium. Alternatively, the liquid may contain a first reagent<br>
and the migration medium may contain a second reagent which<br>
reacts with said first reagent, thereby producing a colour<br>
change. The migration medium may be impregnated, doped or<br>
printed with the second reagent.<br>
The reaction system between said first and second<br>
reagent may be selected from the group comprising: chelation<br>
of a metal ion by a chelating agent, reaction of an acid/base<br>
with a pH indicator, reaction of an electron donor/acceptor<br>
with a redox indicator, and the enzymatic reaction between an<br>
enzyme and a substrate. The metal ions may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of zinc ions, copper ions, iron ions and<br>
calcium ions; chelating agents are selected from the group<br>
consisting of 1,10 phenanthroline, zincon, and 2,2'-<br>
biquioline (cupron) and PAR; acid/base reagents are selected<br>
from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, citric acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogen<br>
phosphate; pH indicators are selected from the group<br>
consisting of bromothymol blue, methyl red and cresol red;<br>
electron donor/acceptors are selected from the group<br>
consisting of bleaching powder and vanadium salts,- and redox<br>
indicators are selected from the group consisting of n-<br>
phenylanthrancilic acid and bleachable dyes.<br>
The liquid may be a viscous liquid, such that the<br>
viscosity of said liquid controls the rate of liquid<br>
migration through the migration medium. The liquid may<br>
contain an oil and an oil-soluble dye or may contain water, a<br>
water-soluble dye and, in some cases, also a chemical to<br>
control the viscosity of said liquid.<br>
The mechanism for said migration may be diffusion or<br>
capillary action. The migration medium may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of polymeric micro-porous materials such<br>
as polyolefin plastics, cellulose-based materials including<br>
paper, sol-gels, and particle-filled Teflon. The migration<br>
medium may comprise a micro-porous polymeric material with a<br>
silica filler. The migration medium may be composed of a<br>
combination of the named porous materials, such as paper<br>
dipped in a sol-gel solution.<br>
The indicator may incorporate an adhesive backing for<br>
attachment to the products and packages to be stored. The<br>
indicator may comprise means defining a migration passage<br>
along the length of the migration medium. The defining means<br>
may be in the form of a seal. The migration passage reduces<br>
the amount of liquid which is required and reduces any<br>
accidental seepage of liquid from the indicator.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided a method of manufacturing a time indicator<br>
comprising providing a base layer formed with a dished<br>
portion for a liquid reservoir, an intermediate layer having<br>
an inlet and a migration layer comprising a migration medium;<br>
bonding the base layer to the intermediate layer with the<br>
inlet aligned with the dished portion; feeding liquid through<br>
the inlet into the dished portion to form a liquid reservoir;<br>
and partially bonding the migration layer to the intermediate<br>
layer whereby when the time indicator is activated liquid<br>
travels rapidly from the liquid reservoir to a chamber which<br>
is formed between the migration layer and the intermediate<br>
layer and then migrates slowly along the length of the<br>
migration medium over time.<br>
The intermediate layer preferably comprises a vent to<br>
allow air from the first reservoir to be vented as the first<br>
reservoir is filled with liquid during manufacture. Thus, the<br>
intermediate layer may be considered to act as a layer which<br>
facilitates filling.<br>
The method may comprise printing on part of the surface<br>
of the intermediate layer to resist bonding between the<br>
migration layer and the intermediate layer. In this way, a<br>
second reservoir in the form of an inflatable pocket may be<br>
formed after activation of the indicator. The pocket forms<br>
between the migration layer and the intermediate layer in the<br>
region of the part of the surface which resists bonding. The<br>
method may comprise defining a migration passage along the<br>
length of the migration medium, for example by forming a seal<br>
in the migration layer which defines the migration passage.<br>
The method may comprise bonding an at least partially<br>
transparent layer to the migration layer and may comprise<br>
defining indicia on the transparent layer whereby the time<br>
elapsed is measured by comparing the progress of the colour<br>
change along the migration medium with the indicia.<br>
Alternatively, the method may comprise printing indicia on<br>
the migration layer whereby the time elapsed is measured by<br>
comparing the progress of the colour change along the<br>
migration medium with the indicia.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided a lifetime indicator device comprising a liquid<br>
reservoir containing a liquid with a dissolved red dye, a<br>
micro-porous medium composed of a polyolefin plastic with a<br>
primarily silica filler, a partially transparent mask placed<br>
above said micro-porous medium such that, on bringing the<br>
liquid in contact with said medium said liquid slowly<br>
diffuses through said medium yielding a colour change to red,<br>
where the front of said colour change slowly proceeds along<br>
said micro-porous medium and is viewed via a mask containing<br>
indicia that relate the progress of said front to the<br>
lifetime of the item to which the time indicator is attached.<br>
The invention will now be described in connection with<br>
certain embodiments with reference to the following<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br><br>
In the following figures similar numbers are used to<br>
designate similar parts. An exemplary time indicator (the<br>
device) according to the present invention is shown in Figs.<br>
1A and 1B. The device comprises a base layer 10 containing a<br>
first liquid reservoir 13, a central layer 11 comprising a<br>
migration medium, and a partially transparent upper layer 12<br>
which provides two windows 17,18 through which the progress<br>
of the liquid through the migration medium may be viewed.<br>
The base layer 10 constitutes a lower seal for the<br>
indicator as a whole. The base layer 10 comprises a dished<br>
portion 19 which forms a button and contains the first<br>
reservoir 13 which serves to drive the liquid-migration<br>
mechanism. The dished portion 19 may be thermoformed. The<br>
underside of said base layer 10 may be an adhesive surface<br>
serving to attach the indicator to the item being monitored.<br>
The upper surface of the base 10 is attached by strong<br>
adhesive to the central layer 11 except in two places: along<br>
a weak seal 14, and along a liquid conduit 15. The liquid<br>
conduit 15 has a first end connected to the seal 14 and a<br>
second end leading to a second reservoir in the form of an<br>
open section, or cavity 16 in the middle layer 11 which<br>
connects to the migration medium.<br>
Once assembled, the device is activated by compressing<br>
the dished portion 19 whereby the increased pressure on the<br>
liquid in the reservoir causes the weak seal 14 to rupture.<br>
The liquid flows rapidly down the liquid conduit 15 and up<br>
into the cavity 16 in the middle layer 11. Said middle layer<br>
11 comprises a laminated package encapsulating a porous or<br>
micro-porous medium which acts as the migration medium.<br>
After entering the cavity 16, the liquid begins its slow-<br>
migration along said medium.<br>
The upper layer 12 comprises transparent windows 17, 18<br>
(indicia) showing the progress of the said 3 low-migration<br>
process, thereby acting as a graphic mask. One window 18 is<br>
positioned above the cavity 16 in the middle layer 12 and a<br>
second window is positioned above the intended end-point.<br>
When the device is activated, the liquid flows into cavity 16<br>
and a colour change is seen through the first window 18 which<br>
shows the device has been activated. A colour-change viewed<br>
at the second window 17 shows that the intended end-point<br>
(corresponding to the i lifetime of the item being monitored)<br>
has been reached.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 2A &amp; 2B, there are seen two<br>
exemplary embodiments of the middle layer of the device, the<br>
middle layer being the slow liquid-migration component. In<br>
Pig. 2A, the middle layer 20 comprises a laminated strip 26<br>
of a porous or micro-porous material which serves as the<br>
slow-migration medium for the liquid that arrives into the<br>
second reservoir or cavity 22 defined by the cut-out section<br>
of said medium. Said liquid migration is prevented from<br>
extending beyond the edges of the layer by a pressure heat<br>
seal 24 applied around the edges of the layer, said sealing<br>
operation essentially closing the pores of the micro-porous<br>
material.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 2B, the<br>
middle layer 2 0 comprises an encapsulated strip 2 6 of a<br>
micro-porous material which serves as the slow-migration<br>
medium for the liquid that arrives into the cavity 22 cut<br>
into said medium. Said liquid-migration is prevented from<br>
extending beyond the strip 2 6 by the laminate-to-laminate<br>
bond in the surrounding margin 28.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, an alternative embodiment of<br>
the liquid release mechanism is shown. According to this<br>
embodiment a first reservoir in the form of a rupturable<br>
capsule 30 containing the liquid is placed within a second<br>
reservoir in the form of a cavity 32. Pressure exerted above<br>
and below said cavity 32 causes the release of the liquid<br>
into the cavity and hence the start of the liquid migration.<br>
In this embodiment, the lower layer of the device only serves<br>
to provide a lower seal, and thus the thermoformed reservoir<br>
and conduit of Fig. 1 are obviated.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4A to 4F, the progress over time<br>
of the liquid-migration front in the migration medium is<br>
shown in Figs. 4A to 4C. The colour-change as viewed through<br>
the said partially transparent upper layer of the device is<br>
shown in Figs. 4D to 4F. Initially, as shown in Figs. 4A and<br>
4D respectively, the liquid is contained within the cavity<br>
and a colour change is only visible in the first or start<br>
window 48. This shows that the device has been activated.<br>
As time progresses, as shown in Fig. 4B, the liquid<br>
starts to migrate out from the cavity and begins to colour<br>
the edges surrounding the cavity 42. As shown in Fig. 4E, no<br>
colour change is visible in the second or expire window. Over<br>
time the coloured area progressively and cumulatively expands<br>
lengthwise along the indicator by migrating down the<br>
migration medium 44. Finally, as shown in Fig. 4C, all or<br>
almost all of the migration medium has changed colour and as<br>
shown in Fig. 4F, a colour change is visible in the second<br>
window indicating that the product has expired.<br>
As will be clear to one skilled in the art, various<br>
types of graphic design may be employed for the<br>
expiry/lifetime end-point, including but not limited to<br>
various lines, curves, ellipses, rectangles or points.<br>
Similarly, indicia showing the progress of the liquid-<br>
migration front may also be employed, including but not<br>
limited to various arrows, curves, lines and points of<br>
different sizes.<br>
Furthermore, each embodiment, may be adapted to include<br>
numerous additional indicia to show the status of the time<br>
indicator. Such indicia (not shown) can include graphic<br>
symbols showing the gradual advance to said end-point. The<br>
starting colour seen through the windows may be the same as<br>
the background colour of the upper layer, and thus any colour<br>
change stands out clearly. The final colour may be red; a<br>
transition to red being readily understandable as a sign that<br>
the item being monitored should be disposed of.<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B show an alternative indicator comprising<br>
a base layer 50, an upper migration layer 56 comprising a<br>
migration medium and an intermediate layer 60 sandwiched<br>
between the upper layer 56 and the base layer 50. The upper<br>
migration layer 56 is laminated, i.e. covered on both<br>
surfaces by a laminate layer 51. The upper surface of the<br>
migration layer 56 is printed with indicia showing the start-<br>
point and the end-point, thus avoiding the need for a<br>
separate partially transparent upper layer for printing.<br>
Furthermore, the printing of the migration layer 56 may<br>
define transparent windows as in earlier embodiments.<br>
The base layer 50 is preferably made of PVC and is<br>
formed with a dished portion 52 which contains a first liquid<br>
reservoir 54. The intermediate layer is provided with a vent<br>
65 and an inlet 64 which connects the liquid reservoir 54 to<br>
a small cavity 66 in the migration layer 56. The intermediate<br>
layer 60 is sealed to the migration layer 56 by a thermal<br>
adhesive applied to an upper surface of the intermediate<br>
layer 60 except in a print area 67 covering part of the lower<br>
surface of the migration layer 56. The print area 66 is<br>
printed with a material, e.g. paint, which forms a weak<br>
adhesive bond with the thermal adhesive which may be W60 and<br>
W60 pre-applied aliphatic polyester water-based urethane<br>
adhesives from Lmarr (Glen Ellen, CA, US).<br>
The device is activated by depressing the dished portion<br>
52 which forces liquid from the reservoir 54 through inlet 64<br>
into the cavity 66. The cavity 66 expands or inflates over<br>
the print area 67 to form a second reservoir in the form of<br>
an internal pocket 68 as shown in Fig. 5B. Once the pocket<br>
68 is formed, the button or dished portion 52 remains in its<br>
depressed state. The liquid then begins to diffuse over time<br>
through the migration medium as described above.<br>
Figs. 6A to 6C show the device of Figs. 5A and 5B with a<br>
mechanism to channel the migration of the liquid into a<br>
narrow path through the migration medium. Heat and pressure<br>
is used to form a seal 70 which defines the narrow path. Fig.<br>
6A shows the device before activation and thus no liquid is present in the cavity 66. Shortly after activation the<br>
cavity 66 is filled with liquid and liquid begins to diffuse<br>
into the migration medium as shown in Fig. 6B. Over time the<br>
liquid continues to advance along the migration medium along<br>
the narrow path defined by the seal 70 as shown in Fig. 6C<br>
The embodiment of Figs. 5A to 5B may be manufactured as<br>
follows:<br>
1) A plastic PVC layer is thermoformed at 150 to 160°C to<br>
form a base layer 50 having a dished portion 52;<br>
2) A second plastic layer having an inlet 64 and a vent 65<br>
is glued to the base layer 50 to form an intermediate<br>
layer 60 with the inlet being aligned with the dished<br>
portion;<br>
3) Liquid is fed through the inlet into the dished portion<br>
to form a first reservoir. As the liquid fills the<br>
reservoir, air is evacuated from the dished portion<br>
through the vent 65. The intermediate layer 60 may be<br>
considered to be a filling-facilitator layer and enables<br>
rapid manufacturing speeds to be achieved;<br>
4) Adhesive is applied to the free surface of the<br>
intermediate layer 60;<br>
5) A migration layer 56 comprising a migration medium is<br>
printed over part of its surface with a material, e.g.<br>
paint, which forme a weak bond with the adhesive on the<br>
intermediate layer;<br>
6) The intermediate layer 60 and the migration layer 56 are<br>
bonded together at about 90°C, and<br>
7) Optionally, heat (in the range 15O-200°C) and pressure<br>
are applied to the upper surface to melt the migration<br>
layer thereby forming a seal or partial seal which<br>
defines a narrow migration passage.<br>
8) Optionally, the migration layer 56 may be printed with<br>
indicia or so as to define transparent windows to view<br>
start and end points of the migration. Alternatively, an<br>
additional partially transparent layer with such indicia<br>
may be bonded to the migration layer.<br>
In each of the embodiments the migration medium may be a<br>
porous material such as a micro-porous polymer, for instance<br>
a polyolefin plastic (with a primarily silica filler) such as<br>
Teslin® (PPG Industries, Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) or a<br>
polyethylene with a silica filler such as Artisyn ™ (Daramic<br>
Inc., Owensboro, KY, USA). The liquid used can be any<br>
viscous liquid with the appropriate (e.g. red) colouration,<br>
for example an edible oil such as corn oil containing an oil-<br>
soluble red-dye such as Oil Red EGN (Aldrich Chemical<br>
Company, Inc., USA). In this example, the rate of liquid<br>
migration is determined by the viscosity of the liquid and<br>
the thickness and density of the migration medium.<br>
Advantageously, the choice of an edible oil with a food<br>
dye ensures that the device will remain non-toxic, even in<br>
the event that it splits open. A further advantage of said<br>
oil/dye combination is that, as this liquid migrates along<br>
the migration medium, a two-stage colour-change front is<br>
produced as the underlying yellow colour of the oil precedes<br>
the appearance of the red colour. Thus a graduated colour<br>
change occurs, first to yellow as an intermediate colour, and<br>
then to red. Advantageously, said colour change sequence is<br>
intuitive to the consumer due to the familiarity of consumers<br>
with traffic lights which first turn yellow before becoming<br>
red. Similarly, a red colour is associated with danger and<br>
thus said combination provides an optimal colour change<br>
sequence for the device of the present invention.<br>
An alternative liquid/dye combination utilizes a water-<br>
soluble dye (e.g. a red food dye) in water, together with an<br>
additive, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) , to control the<br>
viscosity of the resulting liquid and thus the rate of its<br>
migration. Additionally, a combination of dyes with<br>
differing retention times can be employed, so as to cause one<br>
colour (say yellow) to appear shortly before the final colour<br>
(say red) dominates.<br>
Alternatively, the migration medium may be a micro-<br>
porous doped sol-gel, the liquid may be a solution of a zinc<br>
salt such as zinc chloride, and the colour-changing reaction<br>
system may be a chelation reaction. As the zinc solution<br>
proceeds to migrate slowly through the doped sol-gel medium,<br>
it reacts with the dopant; in this case the chelating agent<br>
4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol monosodium salt, hereinafter PAR,<br>
thereby yielding a colour change from yellow to red.<br>
In one embodiment, the support material for the doped<br>
sol-gel may be standard laser quality paper (80g/m2) paper<br>
which is cut into 1cm by 2.5cm strips and dip-coated with the<br>
PAR-doped sol-gel. The doped sol-gel liquid may be prepared<br>
by first adding a 5ml solution of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to<br>
a stirred solution consisting of 10ml ethanol, 1.6ml triply<br>
distilled water, 4 drops of concentrated (33%) hydrochloric<br>
acid (HCl) and 0.1g of PAR. After stirring for a further 5<br>
minutes, 0.3g of a surfactant such as CTAB<br>
(hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide) is added and stirred<br>
until the solution becomes homogeneous. The solution is<br>
stirred for a further two hours. The paper may be dipped<br>
into this sol-gel liquid by holding the paper strip at one by<br>
a dipping machine; lowering it into the non-stirred solution<br>
and then withdrawing it at a rate of 0.08cm/sec. It is then<br>
left to dry at 50 °C in an oven for at least 24 hours to<br>
complete curing.<br>
In this example, the rate of liquid migration is<br>
determined by the pH during preparation of the sol-gel, which<br>
controls the resulting pore size. This choice of reaction<br>
system is especially advantageous because, even if the device<br>
were to split open, no dangerous chemicals would be released.<br>
Zinc solution is non-toxic (being an acceptable constituent<br>
of drinking water at levels up to 5mg/l) and the PAR remains<br>
entrapped as a dopant within the sol-gel matrix and therefore<br>
can not leach out.<br>
As is obvious to one skilled in the art, a number of<br>
alternative migration media and a number of alternative<br>
reaction mechanisms are feasible. A number of micro-porous<br>
media enable a slow-migration effect to be implemented;<br>
examples include Empore™ particle-filled Teflon (available<br>
from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, St. Paul,<br>
Minnesota, USA), Other materials suitable for a migration<br>
media are cellulose-based materials such as paper where both<br>
capillary action and diffusion may contribute to the<br>
migration effect.<br>
A number of alternative chemical systems capable of<br>
producing a similar colour change to that of the above<br>
described embodiments are listed below:<br>
1. To implement other chelation reactions, alternative<br>
chelating agents such as 1,10 phenanthroline, zincon, or<br>
2,2'-biquioline (eupron) can be incorporated or doped into<br>
the porous medium while alternative liquid reagents that<br>
would migrate into the porous medium can include solutions<br>
of metal ions such as copper ions, iron ions and calcium<br>
ions.<br>
2. To implement acid/base reaction systems, suitable pH<br>
indicators including bromothymol blue, methyl red, cresol<br>
red can be incorporated or doped into the migration<br>
medium, and suitable acid/base liquid reagents that would<br>
migrate into the migration medium can include the acids:<br>
hydrochloric acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid and the<br>
bases: sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogen phosphate.<br>
3. To implement redox reactions, redox indicators such as n-<br>
phenylanthrancilic acid or a bleachable dye can be<br>
incorporated or doped into the migration medium while<br>
alternative liquid reagents that would migrate into the<br>
migration medium can include solutions of bleaching powder<br>
or of vanadium salts.<br>
4. To implement an enzymatic reaction, an enzyme such as a<br>
lipase can be incorporated or doped into the migration<br>
medium together with a pH indicator while a liquid<br>
substrate such as tricaproin would migrate into the<br>
migration medium. In one embodiment the reaction product<br>
of the enzymatic reaction of a lipase and tricaproin is<br>
caproic acid; said acid producing a colour shift in the pH<br>
indicator.<br>
The above chemical colour-change system can be<br>
implemented within the context of the present invention by<br>
ensuring that one of the chemical reagents is present in the<br>
migrating liquid, while the other is present in the migration<br>
medium. Means known in the art for placing a chemical within<br>
a migration medium include doping (as per the sol-gel<br>
description above); dipping and printing of the chemical into<br>
or on to said medium.<br>
As set out above, activation of each embodiment is by<br>
the simple application of pressure on a portion of said<br>
indicator, the invention has the advantage of being easy to<br>
use and may have foolproof operation. Furthermore, by basing<br>
the construction of the indictor on printable, sheet-like<br>
liquid migration media; fabrication may be performed using<br>
simple technologies such as printing, dipping, stamping and<br>
lamination. Thus, the time indicator may have a simple and<br>
inexpensive manufacture. For example off-the-ahelf media may<br>
be adapted to provide an indicator according to the<br>
invention. The time indicator of may also be suitable for<br>
attachment to containers or other items stored in the<br>
refrigerator or freezer and may use liquid which do not<br>
freeze, for example mixtures of propylene glycol and water at<br>
various concentrations or synthetic oils designed to operate<br>
at sub-zero conditions<br>
This may be particularly useful for the longer time<br>
frames, e.g. six months<br>
It will thus be seen that according to the present<br>
invention a simple and inexpensive time indicator for<br>
consumers is described. While the invention has been shown<br>
herein in what is presently conceived to be the most<br>
practical and preferred embodiments thereof, it will be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many<br>
