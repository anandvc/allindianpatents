				<td>The present invention relates to method for coding a digital<br>
audio frame and an audio coder to implement the said method.The<br>
invention further relates to devices for coding and decoding<br>
audio signals, intended in particular to sit within applications<br>
of transmission or storage of digitized and compressed audio<br>
signals (speech and/or sounds).<br>
More particularly, this invention pertains to audio coding<br>
systems having the capacity to provide varied bit rates, also<br>
referred to as multirate coding systems. Such systems are<br>
distinguished from fixed rate coders by their capacity to modify<br>
the bit rate of the coding, possibly during processing, this<br>
being especially suited to transmission over heterogeneous access<br>
networks: be they networks of IP type mixing fixed and mobile<br>
access, high bit rates (ADLS) , low bit rates (RTC, GPRS modems)<br>
or involving terminals with variable capacities (mobiles, PCs,<br>
etc.).<br>
Essentially, two categories of multirate coders are<br>
distinguished: that of "switchable" multirate coders and that of<br>
"hierarchical" coders.<br>
"Switchable" multirate coders rely on a coding architecture<br>
belonging to a technologic'al family (temporal coding or frequency<br>
coding, for example: CELP, sinusoidal, or by transform), in which<br>
an indication of bit rate is simultaneously supplied to the coder<br>
and to the decoder. The coder uses this information to select the<br>
parts of the algorithm and the tables relevant to the bit rate<br>
chosen. The decoder operates in a symmetric manner. Numerous<br>
switchable multirate coding structures have been proposed for<br>
audio coding. Such is the case for example with mobile coders<br>
standardized by the 3GPP organization ("3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project"), NB-AMR ("Narrow Band<br>
Adaptive Multirate", Technical Specification 3GPP<br>
TS 26.090, version 5.0.0, June 2002) in the telephone<br>
band, or WB-AMR ("Wide Band Adaptive Multirate",<br>
Technical Specification 3GPP TS 26.190, version 5.1.0,<br>
December 2001) in wideband. These coders operate over<br>
fairly wide bit rate ranges (4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s for<br>
NB-AMR, and 6.60 to 23.85 kbit/s for WB-AMR), with a<br>
fairly sizeable granularity (8 bit rates for NB-AMR and<br>
9 for WB-AMR) . However, the price to be paid for this<br>
flexibility is a rather considerable complexity of<br>
structure: to be able to host all these bit rates,<br>
these coders must support numerous different options,<br>
varied quantization tables etc. The performance curve<br>
increases progressively with bit rate, but the progress<br>
is not linear and certain bit rates are in essence<br>
better optimized than others.<br>
In so-called "hierarchical" coding systems, also<br>
referred to as "scalable", the binary data arising from<br>
the coding operation are distributed into successive<br>
layers. A base layer, also called the "kernel", is<br>
formed of the binary elements that are absolutely<br>
necessary for the decoding of the binary train, and<br>
determine a minimum quality of decoding.<br>
The subsequent layers make it possible to progressively<br>
improve the quality of the signal arising from the<br>
decoding operation, each new layer bringing new<br>
information which, utilized by the decoder, supplies a<br>
signal of increasing quality at output.<br>
One of the particular features of hierarchical coding<br>
is the possibility offered of intervening at any level<br>
whatsoever of the transmission or storage chain so as<br>
to delete a part of the binary train without having to<br>
supply any particular indication to the coder or to the<br>
decoder. The decoder uses the binary information that<br>
it receives and produces a signal of corresponding<br>
quality.<br>
The field of hierarchical coding structures has given<br>
rise likewise to much work. Certain hierarchical coding<br>
structures operate on the basis of one type of coder<br>
alone, designed to deliver hierarchized coded<br>
information. When the additional layers improve the<br>
quality of the output signal without modifying the<br>
bandwidth, one speaks rather of "embedded coders" (see<br>
for example R.D. Lacpvo et al., "Embedded CELP Coding<br>
for Variable Bit-Rate Between 6.4 and 9.6 kbit/s, Proc<br>
ICASSP 1991, pp. 681-686) . Coders of this type do not<br>
however allow large 'gaps between the lowest and the<br>
highest bit rate proposed.<br>
The hierarchy is often used to progressively increase<br>
the bandwidth of the signal: the kernel supplies a<br>
baseband signal, for Example telephonic (300-3400 Hz),<br>
and the subsequent layers allow the coding of<br>
additional frequency bands (for example, wide band up<br>
to 7 kHz, HiFi band up to 20 kHz or intermediate,<br>
etc.). The subband coders or coders using a<br>
time/frequency transformation such as described in the<br>
documents "Subband/trahsform coding using filter banks<br>
designs based on time domain aliasing cancellation" by<br>
J.P. Princen et al. (:Proc. IEEE ICASSP-87, pp. 2161-<br>
2164) and "High Quality Audio Transform Coding at<br>
64 kbit/s", by Y. Mahieux et al. (IEEE Trans. Commun.,<br>
Vol. 42, No. 11, November 1994, pp. 3010-3019), lend<br>
themselves particularly to such operations.<br>
Moreover, a different coding technique is frequently<br>
used for the kernel and for the module or modules<br>
coding the additional layers, one then speaks of<br>
various coding stages, each stage consisting of a<br>
subcoder. The subcoder of the stage of a given level<br>
will be able either to code parts of the signal that<br>
are not coded by the previous stages, or to code the<br>
coding residual of the previous stage, the residual is<br>
obtained by subtracting the decoded signal from the<br>
original signal.<br>
The advantage of such structures it that they make it<br>
possible to go down, to relatively low bit rates with<br>
sufficient quality, while producing good quality at<br>
high bit rate. Specifically, the techniques -used for<br>
low bit rates are not generally effective at high bit<br>
rates and vice versa.;<br>
Such structures making it possible to use two different<br>
technologies (for example CELP and time/frequency<br>
transform, etc.) are especially effective for sweeping<br>
large bit rate ranges.<br>
However, the hierarchical coding structures proposed in<br>
the prior art define precisely the_bit. rate allocated<br>
to eacn of the intermediate layers. Each layer<br>
corresponds to the encoding of certain parameters, and<br>
the granularity of the hierarchical binary train<br>
depends on the bit rate allocated to these parameters<br>
(typically a layer can contain of the order of a few<br>
tens of bits per frame, a signal frame consisting of a<br>
certain number of samples of the signal over a given<br>
duration, the example described later considering a<br>
frame of 960 samples corresponding to 60 ms of signal).<br>
Moreover, when the bandwidth of the decoded signals can<br>
vary according to the level of the layers of binary<br>
elements, the modification of the line bit rate may<br>
produce artifacts that impede listening.<br>
The present invention has the aim in particular of<br>
proposing a multirate coding solution which alleviates<br>
the drawbacks cited in the case of the use of existing<br>
hierarchical and switchable codings.<br>
The invention thus proposes a method of coding a<br>
digital audio signal frame as a binary output sequence,<br>
in wnich a maximum number Nmax of coding bits is<br>
defined for a set of parameters that can be calculated<br>
according to the signal frame, which set is composed of<br>
a first and of a second subset. The proposed method<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
calculating the; parameters of the first subset,<br>
and coding these parameters on a number NO of<br>
coding bits such that NO 
determining an allocation of Nmax - NO coding bits<br>
for the parameters of the second subset; and<br>
ranking the Nmax - NO coding bits allocated to the<br>
parameters of the second subset in a determined<br>
order. <br>
The allocation and/or the order of ranking of the<br>
Nmax - NO coding bits are determined as a function of<br>
the coded parameters] of the first subset. The coding<br>
method furthermore comprises the following steps in<br>
response to the indication of a number N of bits of the<br>
binary output sequence that are available for the<br>
coding of said set of parameters, with NO 
selecting the second subset's parameters to which<br>
are allocated the N - NO coding bits ranked first<br>
in said order;<br>
calculating the selected parameters of the second<br>
subset, and coding these parameters so as to<br>
produce said N - nO coding bits ranked first; and<br>
inserting into the output sequence the NO coding<br>
bits of the first subset as well as the N - NO<br>
coding bits of the selected parameters of the<br>
second subset.<br>
The method according to the invention makes it possible<br>
to define a multirate coding, which will operate at<br>
least in a range corresponding for each frame to a<br>
number of bits ranging' from NO to Nmax.<br>
It may thus be considered that the notion of pre-<br>
established bit rates which is related to the existing<br>
hierarchical and switchable codings is replaced by a<br>
notion of "cursor", making it possible to freely vary<br>
the bit rate between a minimum value (that may possibly<br>
correspond to a number of bits N less than NO) and a<br>
maximum value (corresponding to Nmax). These extreme<br>
values are potentially far apart. The method offers<br>
good performance in terms of effectiveness of coding<br>
regardless of the bit rate chosen.<br>
Advantageously, the [number N of bits of the binary<br>
output sequence is strictly less than Nmax. What is<br>
noteworthy about the coder is then that the allocation<br>
of the bits that is employed makes no reference to the<br>
actual output bit rate of the coder, but to another<br>
number Nmax agreed with the decoder.<br>
It is however possible to fix Nmax = N as a function of<br>
the instantaneous bit, rate available on a transmission<br>
channel. The output sequence of a switchable multirate<br>
coder such as this may be processed by a decoder which<br>
does not receive the entire sequence, so long as it is<br>
capable of retrieving the structure of the coding bits<br>
of the second subset by virtue of the knowledge of<br>
Nmax.<br>
Another case where it is possible to have N = Nmax is<br>
that of the storage of;audio data at the maximum coding<br>
rate. When reading N' bits of this content stored at<br>
lower bit rate, the decoder would be capable of<br>
retrieving the structure of the coding bits of the<br>
second subset as long a&gt;s N' &gt; NO.<br>
The order of ranking of the coding bits allocated to<br>
the parameters of the second subset may be a<br>
preestablished order.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the order of ranking of the<br>
coding bits allocated to the parameters of the second<br>
subset is variable. It may in particular be an order of<br>
decreasing importance determined as a function of at<br>
least the coded parameters of the first subset. Thus<br>
the decoder which receives a binary sequence of N' bits<br>
for the frame, with NO 
deduce this order from the NO bits received for the<br>
coding of the first subset.<br>
The allocation of the Nmax - NO bits to the coding of<br>
the parameters of the second subset may be carried out<br>
in a fixed manner (in this case, the order of ranking<br>
of these bits will be dependent at least on the coded<br>
parameters of the first subset).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the allocation of the<br>
Nmax - NO bits to the coding of the parameters of the<br>
second subset is a function of the coded parameters of<br>
the first subset.<br>
Advantageously, this order of ranking of the coding<br>
bits allocated to the parameters of the second subset<br>
is determined with the aid of at least one<br>
psychoacoustic criterion as a function of the coded<br>
parameters of the first; subset.<br>
The parameters of the second subset pertain to spectral<br>
bands of the signal. In this case, the method<br>
advantageously comprises a step of estimating a<br>
spectral envelope of the coded signal on the basis of<br>
the coded parameters of the first subset, and a step of<br>
calculating a curve of frequency masking by applying an<br>
auditory perception model to the estimated spectral<br>
envelope, and the psychoacoustic criterion makes<br>
reference to the level of the estimated spectral<br>
envelope with respect to the masking curve in each<br>
spectral band. <br>
In a mode of implementation, the coding bits are<br>
ordered in the output sequence in such a way that the<br>
NO coding' bits of the first subset precede the N - NO<br>
coding bits of the selected parameters of the second<br>
subset and that the respective coding bits of the<br>
selected parameters of the second subset appear therein<br>
in the order determined for said coding bits. This<br>
makes it possible, in the case where the binary<br>
sequence is truncated, to receive the most important<br>
part.<br>
The number N may vary from one frame ' to another, in<br>
particular as a function for example of the available<br>
capacity of the transmission resource.<br>
The multirate audio coding according to the present<br>
invention may be used according to a very flexible<br>
hierarchical or switchable mode, since any number of<br>
bits to be transmitted chosen freely between NO and<br>
Nmax may be selected at any moment, that is to say<br>
frame by frame.<br>
The coding of the parameters of the first subset may be<br>
at variable bit rate, thereby varying the number NO<br>
from one frame to another. This allows best adjustment<br>
of the distribution of the bits as a function of the<br>
frames to be coded.<br>
In a mode of implementation, the first subset comprises<br>
parameters calculated by a coder kernel.<br>
Advantageously, the coder kernel has a lower frequency<br>
band of operation than the bandwidth of the signal to<br>
be coded, and the first subset furthermore comprises<br>
energy levels of the audio signal that are associated<br>
with frequency bands higher than the operating band of<br>
the coder kernel. This type of structure is that of a<br>
hierarchical coder with two levels, which delivers for<br>
example via the coder kernel a coded signal of a<br>
quality deemed to be sufficient and which, as a<br>
function of the bit rate available, supplements the<br>
coding performed by the coder kernel with additional<br>
information arising from the method of coding according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the coding bits of the first subset are<br>
then ordered in the output sequence in such a way that<br>
the coding bits of the parameters calculated by the<br>
coder kernel are immediately followed by the coding<br>
bits of the energy levels associated with the higher<br>
frequency bands. This ensures one and the same<br>
bandwidth for the successively coded frames as long as<br>
the decoder receives enough bits to be in possession of<br>
information of the coder kernel and coded energy levels<br>
associated with the higher frequency bands.<br>
In a mode of implementation, a signal of difference<br>
between the signal to be coded and a synthesis signal<br>
derived from the coded parameters produced by the coder<br>
kernel is estimated, and the first subset furthermore<br>
comprises energy levels of the difference signal that<br>
are associated with frequency bands included in the<br>
operating band of the coder kernel.<br>
A second aspect of the invention pertains to a method<br>
of decoding a binary input sequence so as to synthesize<br>
~a"~digital audio signal corresponding to the decoding of<br>
a frame coded according to the method of coding of the<br>
invention. According to this method, a maximum number<br>
Nmax of coding bits is defined for a set of parameters<br>
for describing a signal frame, which set is composed of<br>
a first and a second subset. The input sequence<br>
comprises, for a signal frame, a number N' of coding<br>
bits for the set of parameters, with N' 
decoding method according to the invention comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
extracting, from said N' bits of the input<br>
sequence, a number NO of coding bits of the<br>
parameters of the first subset if NO 
recovering the parameters of the first subset on<br>
the basis of said NO coding bits extracted;<br>
determining an allocation of Nmax - NO coding bits<br>
for the parameters of the second subset; and<br>
ranking the Nmax - NO coding bits allocated to the<br>
parameters of the second subset in a determined<br>
order.<br>
The allocation and/or the order of ranking of the<br>
Nmax - NO coding bits are determined as a function of<br>
the recovered parameters of the first subset. The<br>
decoding method furthermore comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
selecting the second subset's parameters to which<br>
are allocated the N' - NO coding bits ranked first<br>
in said order;<br>
extracting, from said N' bits of the input<br>
sequence, N' - NO coding bits of the selected<br>
parameters of the second subset;<br>
recovering the selected parameters of the second<br>
subset on the basis of said N' - NO coding bits<br>
extracted; and<br>
synthesizing the signal frame by using the<br>
recovered parameters of the first and second<br>
subsets.<br>
This method of decoding is advantageously associated<br>
with procedures for regenerating the parameters which<br>
are missing on account of the truncation of the<br>
sequence of Nmax bits that is produced, virtually or<br>
otherwise, by the coder.<br>
A third aspect of the invention pertains to an audio<br>
coder, comprisinq means of digital signal processing<br>
that are devised to implement a method of coding<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention pertains to an audio<br>
decoder, comprising means of digital-signal processing<br>
tha are devised to implement a method of decoding<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent in the description hereinbelow of<br>
nonlimiting exemplary embodiments, with reference to<br>
the appended drawings,] in which:<br>
figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary<br>
audio coder according to the invention;<br>
figure 2 represents a binary output sequence of N <br>
bits in a embodiment of the invention; and<br>
figure 3 is a schematic diagram of an audio<br>
decoder according to the invention.<br>
The coder represented I in figure 1 has a hierarchical<br>
structure with two coding stages. A first coding stage<br>
1 consists for example of a coder kernel in a telephone<br>
band (300-3400 Hz) of CELP type. This coder is in the<br>
example considered a G.723.1 coder standardized by the<br>
ITU-T ("International Telecommunication Union") in<br>
fixed mode at 6.4 kbit/s. It calculated G. 723.1<br>
parameters in accordance with the standard and<br>
quantizes them by means, of 192 coding bits P1 per frame<br>
of 30 ms.<br>
The second coding stage 2, making it possible to<br>
increase the bandwidth towards the wide band<br>
(50-7000 Hz) , operates on the coding residual E of the<br>
first stage, supplied by a subtractor 3 in the diagram<br>
of figure 1. A signals synchronization module 4 delays<br>
the audio signal frame S by the time taken by the<br>
processing of the coder kernel 1. Its output is<br>
addressed 'to the subtractor 3 which subtracts from it<br>
the synthetic signal S' equal to the output of the<br>
decoder kernel operating on the basis of the quantized<br>
parameters such as represented by the output bits P1 of<br>
the coder kernel. As is usual, the coder 1 incorporates<br>
a local decoder supplying S', <br>
The audio signal to be coded S has for example a<br>
bandwidth of 7 kHz, while being sampled at 16 kHz. A<br>
frame consists for example of 960 samples, i.e. 60 ms<br>
of signal or two elementary frames of the coder kernel<br>
G. 723.1. Since the latter operates on signals sampled<br>
at 8 kHz, the signal S is subsampled in a factor 2 at<br>
the input of the coder kernel 1. Likewise, the<br>
synthetic signal S' is oversampled at 16 kHz at the<br>
output of the coder kernel 1.<br>
The bit rate of the first stage 1 is 6.4 kbit/s<br>
(2 x Nl = 2 x 192 = 384 bits per frame). If the coder<br>
has a maximum bit rate of 32 kbit/s (Nmax = 1920 bits<br>
per frame), the maximum bit rate of the second stage is<br>
25.6 kbit/s (1920 - 384 = 1536 bits per frame). The<br>
second stage 2 operates for example on elementary<br>
frames, or subframes, of 20 ms (320 samples at 16 kHz).<br>
The second stage 2 comprises a time/frequency<br>
transformation module 5, for example of MDCT ("Modified<br>
Discrete Cosine Transform") type to which the residual<br>
E obtained by the subtractor 3 is addressed. In<br>
practice, the manner of operation of the modules 3 and<br>
5 represented in figure 1 may be achieved by performing<br>
the following operations for each 20 ms subframe:<br>
MDCT transformation of the input signal S delayed<br>
by the module 4, which supplies 320 MDCT<br>
coefficients. The spectrum being limited to<br>
7225 Hz, only the first 289 MDCT coefficients are<br>
different from 0;<br>
MDCT transformation of the synthetic signal S'.<br>
Since one is dealing with the spectrum of a<br>
telephone band signal, only the first 139 MDCT<br>
coefficients are different from 0 (up to 3450 Hz)/<br>
and<br>
calculation of the spectrum of difference between<br>
the previous spectra.<br>
The resulting spectrum is distributed into several<br>
bands of different widths by a module 6. By way of<br>
example, the bandwidth of the G.723.1 codec may be<br>
subdivided into 21 bands while the higher frequencies<br>
are distributed into 11 additional bands. In these 11<br>
additional bands, the residual E is identical to the<br>
input signal S.<br>
A module 7 performs the coding of the spectral envelope<br>
of the residual E. It begins by calculating the energy<br>
of the MDCT coefficients of each band of the difference<br>
spectrum. These energies are hereinbelow referred to as<br>
"scale factors". The 32 scale factors constitute the<br>
spectral envelope of the difference signal. The module<br>
7 then proceeds to their quantization in two parts. The<br>
first part corresponds to the telephone band (first 21<br>
bands, from 0 to 3450 Hz), the second to the high bands<br>
(last 11 bands, from 3450 to 7225 Hz) . In each part,<br>
the first scale factor is quantized on an absolute<br>
basis, and the subsequent ones on a differential basis,<br>
by using a conventional Huffman coding with variable<br>
bit rate. These 32 scale factors are quantized on a<br>
variable number N2(i) of bits P2 for each subframe of<br>
rank i (i = 1, 2, 3) .<br>
The quantized scale factors are denoted FQ in figure 1.<br>
The quantization bits P1, P2 of the first subset<br>
consisting of the quantized parameters of the coder kernel<br>
1 and the quantized scale factors FQ are variable in<br>
number NO = (2 x N1) + N2(l) + N2(2) + N2(3). The<br>
difference Nmax - NO = 1536 - N2(l) - N2{2) - N2(3) is<br>
available to quantize the spectra of the bands more<br>
finely.<br>
A module 8 normalizes the MDCT coefficients distributed<br>
into bands by the module 6, by dividing them by the<br>
quantized scale factors FQ respectively determined for<br>
these bands. The spectra thus normalized are supplied<br>
to the quantization module 9 which uses a vector<br>
quantization scheme of known type. The quantization<br>
bits, arising from the module 9 are denoted P3 in<br>
figure 1.<br>
An output multiplexer 10 gathers together the bits P1,<br>
P2 and P3 arising from the modules 1, 7 and 9 to form<br>
the binary output sequence F of the coder.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the total number of<br>
bits N of the output sequence representing a current<br>
frame is not necessarily equal to Nmax. It may be less<br>
than the latter. However, the allocation of the<br>
quantization bits to the bands is performed on the<br>
basis of the number Nmax.<br>
In the diagram of figure 1, this allocation is<br>
performed for each subframe by the module 12 on the<br>
basis of the number Nmax - NO, of the quantized scale<br>
factors FQ and of a spectral masking curve calculated<br>
by a module 11.<br>
The manner of operation of the latter module 11 is as<br>
follows. It firstly determines an approximate value of<br>
the original spectral envelope of the signal S on the<br>
basis of that of the difference signal, such as<br>
quantized by the module 7, and of that which it<br>
determines with the same resolution for the synthetic<br>
signal S' resulting from the coder kernel. These last<br>
two envelopes are also determinable by a decoder which<br>
is provided only with the parameters of the aforesaid<br>
first subset. Thus the estimated spectral envelope of<br>
the signal S will also be available to the decoder.<br>
Thereafter, the module 11 calculates a spectral masking<br>
curve by applying, in a manner known per se, a model of<br>
band by band auditlory perception to the original<br>
estimated spectral envelope. This curve 11 gives a<br>
masking level for each band considered.<br>
The module 12 carries out a dynamic allocation of the<br>
Nmax - NO remaining bits of the sequence F among the<br>
3 x 32 bands of the three MDCT transformations of the<br>
difference signal. In the implementation of the<br>
invention set forth here, as a function of a criterion<br>
of psychoacoustic perceptual importance making<br>
reference to the level of the spectral envelope<br>
estimated with respect to the masking curve in each<br>
band, a bit rate proportional to this level is<br>
allocated to each band. Other ranking criteria would be<br>
useable.<br>
Subsequent to this allocation of bits, the module 9<br>
knows how many bits are to be considered for the<br>
quantization of each band in each subframe.<br>
Nevertheless, if N 
not necessarily all be used. An ordering of the bits<br>
representing the bands is performed by a module 13 as a<br>
function of a criterion of perceptual importance. The<br>
module 13 ranks the 3 x 32 bands in an order of<br>
decreasing importance which may be the decreasing order<br>
of the signal-to-mask ratios (ratio between the<br>
estimated spectral envelope and the masking curve in<br>
each band) . This order is used for the construction of<br>
the binary sequence F in accordance with the invention.<br>
As a function of the desired number N of bits in the<br>
sequence F for the coding of the current frame, the<br>
bands which are to be quantized by the module 9 are<br>
determined by selecting the bands ranked first by the<br>
module 13 and by keeping for each band selected a<br>
number of bits such as is determined by the module 12.<br>
Then the MDCT coefficients of each band selected are<br>
quantized by the module 9, for example with the aid of<br>
a vector quantizer, in accordance with the allocated<br>
number of bits, so as to produce a total number of bits<br>
equal to N - NO.<br>
The output multiplexer 10 builds the binary sequence F<br>
consisting of the first N bits qf the following ordered<br>
sequence represented in figure 2 (case N = Nmax):<br>
a/ firstly the binary trains corresponding to the two<br>
G. 723.1 frames (384 bits');<br>
b/ next the bits for quantizing the scale<br>
factors, for the three subframes (i = 1, 2, 3),<br>
from the 22nd spectral band (first band beyond the<br>
telephone band) to the 32nd band (variable rate<br>
Huffman coding);<br>
c/ next the bits for quantizing the scale<br>
factors, for the three subframes (i = 1, 2, 3),<br>
from the 1st spectral band to the 21st band<br>
(variable rate Huffman coding);<br>
d/ and finally the indices Mc1, Mc2, Mc96 of<br>
vector quantization of the 96 bands in order of<br>
perceptual importance, from the most important<br>
band to the least important band, while complying<br>
with the order determined by the module 13.<br>
By placing first (a and b) the G.723.1 parameters and<br>
the scale factors of the high bands it is possible to<br>
retain the same bandwidth for the signal restorable by<br>
the decoder regardless of the actual bit rate beyond a<br>
minimum value corresponding to the reception of these<br>
groups a and b. This minimum value, sufficient for the<br>
Huffman coding of the 3 x 11 = 33 scale factors of the<br>
high bands in addition to the G.723.1 coding, is for<br>
example 8 kbit/s.<br>
The method of coding hereinabove allows a decoding of<br>
the frame if the decoder receives N' bits with<br>
NO 
from one frame to another.<br>
A decoder according to the invention, corresponding to<br>
this example, is illustrated by figure 3. A<br>
demultiplexer 20 separates the sequence of bits<br>
received F so as to extract therefrom the coding bits<br>
P1 and P2. The 384 bits P1 are supplied to the decoder<br>
kernel 21 of G.723.1 type so that the latter<br>
synthesizes two frames of the base signal S' in the<br>
telephone band. The bits P2 are decoded according to<br>
the Huffman algorithm by a module 22 which thus<br>
recovers the quantized scale factors FQ for each of the<br>
3 subframes.<br>
A module 23 calculating the masking curve, identical to<br>
the module 11 of the coder of figure 1, receives the<br>
base signal S' and the quantized scale factors FQ and<br>
produces the spectral masking levels for each of the 96<br>
bands. On the basis of these masking levels, of the<br>
quantized scale factors FQ and of the knowledge of the<br>
number Nmax (as well as of that of the number NO which<br>
is deduced from the Huffman decoding of the bits P2 by<br>
the module 22), a module 24 determines an allocation of<br>
bits in the same manner as the module 12 of figure 1.<br>
Furthermore, a module 25 proceeds to the ordering of<br>
the bands according to the same ranking criterion as<br>
the module 13 described with reference to figure 1.<br>
According to the information supplied by the modules 24<br>
and 25, the module 26 extracts the bits P3 of the input<br>
sequence F' and synthesizes the normalized MDCT<br>
coefficients relating to the bands represented in the<br>
sequence F' If appropriate (N' 
standardized MDCT coefficients relating to the missing<br>
bands may furthermore be synthesized by interpolation<br>
or extrapolation as described hereinbelow (module 27) .<br>
These missing bands may have been eliminated by the<br>
coder on account of a truncation to N 
may have been eliminated in the course of transmission<br>
(N' 
The standardized MDCT coefficients, synthesized by the<br>
module 26 and/or the module 27, are multiplied by their<br>
respective quantized scale factors (multiplier 28)<br>
before being presented to the module 29 which performs<br>
the frequency/time transformation which is the inverse<br>
of the MDCT transformation operated by the module 5 of<br>
the coder. The temporal correction signal which results<br>
therefrom is added to the synthetic signal S' delivered<br>
by the decoder kernel 21 (adder 30) to produce the<br>
output audio signal S of the decoder.<br>
It should be noted that the decoder will be able to<br>
synthesize a signal S even in cases where it does not<br>
receive the first NO bits of the sequence.<br>
It is sufficient for it to receive the 2 x Nl bits<br>
corresponding to the part a of the listing hereinabove,<br>
the decoding then being in a "degraded" mode. Only this<br>
degraded mode does not use the MDCT synthesis to obtain<br>
the decoded signal. To ensure the switching with no<br>
break between this mode and the other modes, the<br>
decoder performs three MDCT analyses followed by three<br>
MDCT syntheses, allowing the updating of the memories<br>
of the MDCT transformation. The output signal contains<br>
a signal of telephone band quality. If the first 2 x Nl<br>
bits are not even received, the decoder considers the<br>
corresponding frame as having been erased and can use a<br>
known algorithm for conceiving erased frames.<br>
If the decoder receives the 2 x Nl bits corresponding<br>
to part a plus bits of part b (high bands of the three<br>
spectral envelopes), it can begin to synthesize a wide<br>
band signal. It can in particular proceed as follows.<br>
1/ The module 22 recovers the parts of the three<br>
spectral envelopes received.<br>
2/ The bands not received have their scale factors<br>
temporarily set to zero.<br>
3/ The low parts of the spectral envelopes are<br>
calculated on the basis of the MDCT analyses<br>
performed on the signal obtained after the G.723.1<br>
decoding, and the module 23 calculates the three<br>
masking curves on the envelopes thus obtained.<br>
4/ The spectral envelope is corrected so as to<br>
regularize it by avoiding the nulls due to the<br>
bands not received; the zero values in the high<br>
part of the spectral envelopes FQ are for example<br>
replaced by a hundredth of the value of the<br>
masking curve calculated previously, so that they<br>
remain inaudible. The complete spectrum of the low<br>
bands and the spectral envelope of the high bands<br>
are known at this juncture.<br>
5/ The module 27 then generates the high spectrum.<br>
The fine structure of these bands is generated by<br>
reflection of the fine structure of its known<br>
neighborhood before weighting by the scale factors<br>
(multipliers 28) . In the case where none of the<br>
bits P3 is received, the "known neighborhood"<br>
corresponds to the spectrum of the signal S'<br>
produced by the G.723.1 decoder kernel. Its<br>
"reflection" can consist in copying the value of<br>
the standardized MDCT spectrum, possibly with its<br>
variations being attenuated in proportion to the<br>
distance away from the "known neighborhood".<br>
6/ After inverse MDCT transformation (29) and<br>
addition (30) of :he resulting correction signal<br>
to the output signal of the decoder kernel, the<br>
wide band synthesized signal is obtained.<br>
In the case where the decoder also receives part at<br>
least of the low spectral envelope of the difference<br>
signal (part c) , it may or may not take this<br>
information into account to refine the spectral<br>
envelope in step 3.<br>
If the decoder 10 receives enough bits P3 to decode at<br>
least the MDCT coefficients of the most important band,<br>
ranked first in the part d of the sequence, then the<br>
module 26 recovers certain of the normalized MDCT<br>
coefficients according to the allocation and ordering<br>
that are indicated by the modules 24 and 25. These MDCT<br>
coefficients therefore, need not be interpolated as in<br>
step 5 hereinabove. For the other bands, the process of<br>
steps 1 to 6 is applicable by the module 27 in the same<br>
manner as previously; the knowledge of the MDCT<br>
coefficients received for certain bands allowing more<br>
reliable interpolation in step 5.<br>
The bands not received may vary from one MDCT subframe<br>
to the next. The "known neighborhood" of a missing band<br>
may correspond to the same band in another subframe<br>
where . it is not missing, and/or to one or more bands<br>
closest in the frequency domain in the course of the<br>
same subframe. It is also possible to regenerate an<br>
MDCT spectrum missing from a band for a subframe by<br>
calculating a weighted sum of contributions evaluated<br>
on the basis of several bands/subframes of the "known<br>
neighborhood".<br>
Insofar as the actual bit rate of N' bits per frame<br>
places the last bit of a given frame arbitrarily, the<br>
last coded parameter transmitted may, according to<br>
case, be transmitted completely or partially. Two cases<br>
may then arise:<br>
either the coding structure adopted makes it<br>
possible to utilize the partial information<br>
received (case of scalar quantizers, or of vector<br>
quantization with partitioned dictionaries),<br>
or it does not allow it and the parameter not<br>
fully received is processed like the other<br>
parameters not received. It is noted that, for<br>
this latter case. if the order of the bits varies<br>
with each frame, the number of bits thus lost is<br>
variable and the selection of N' bits will produce<br>
on average, over the whole set of frames decoded,<br>
a better quality than that which would be obtained<br>
with a smaller number of bits.<br>

A method of coding a digital audio signal frame (S) as<br>
a binary output sequence (Φ), in which a maximum number<br>
Nmax of coding bits is defined for a set of parameters that<br>
can be calculated accordingto the signal frame, which set<br>
it composed of a first and of a second subset,the method<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
- Calculating (1) the parameters of the first subset, and<br>
coding these parameters on a number NO of coding bits<br>
such that NO 
- determining (12) an allocation of Nmax-NO coding bits<br>
for the parameters of the second subset; and<br>
- ranking (13) the Nmax - NO coding bits allocated to the<br>
parameters of the second subset in a determined<br>
order,<br>
in which the allocation and/or the order of ranking of the<br>
Nmax - NO coding bits is determined as a function of the<br>
coded parameters of the first subset, the method<br>
furthermore comprising the following steps in response to<br>
the indication of a number N of bits of the binary output<br>
sequence that are available for the coding of said set of<br>
parameters, with NO 
- selecting the second subset's parameters to which are<br>
allocated the N - NO 'coding bits ranked first in said<br>
order;<br>
- calculating (9) the selected parameters of the<br>
second subset, and coding these parameters so as to<br>
produce said N - NO coding bits ranked first;<br>
and<br>
- inserting (10) into the output sequence the NO coding<br>
bits of the first subset as well as the N - NO coding<br>
bits of the selected parameters of the second subset.<br>
