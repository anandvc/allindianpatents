				<td>TURBINE GENERATOR DURING GRID FAULTS AND A POWER GRID<br>
CONNECTED WIND TURBINE GENERATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling a power-grid<br>
connected wind turbine generator during grid faults and a power grid connected<br>
wind turbine generator.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In wind turbine systems it is known to provide some kind of control of the<br>
wind turbine during grid faults. However, the general concept of such control<br>
apparatus aims at stopping the wind turbine by pitching the blades of the wind<br>
turbine out of the wind and disconnecting the generator from the grid. After a<br>
certain time, when the grid voltage has been re-established, the wind turbine is<br>
started up in the normal fashion in order to deliver power to the grid, and the time<br>
from disconnection to restart of the wind turbine has traditionally been in the<br>
order of 1-10 minutes. The short circuit current contribution from the wind turbine<br>
generator has generally been limited to last approximately 40-50 ms, after which<br>
the current from the wind turbine generator has been zero. Thus, the wind<br>
turbine generator does not contribute to the re-establishment of the grid voltage<br>
and does not contribute to the short circuit current in the grid over a longer period<br>
of time, which may be necessary in order to activate the grid protection means<br>
for disconnecting the faulty parts of the power grid.<br><br><br>
2<br>
From EP-0 984 552 it is known to disconnect the stator windings of a<br>
generator from the power grid when a fault is detected and to connect<br>
impedances to the stator windings for dissipating the power generated during<br>
such grid fault conditions, and to maintain a certain magnetization of the<br>
generator. After clearance of the fault the generator is resynchronized to the<br>
power grid and the stator windings are reconnected to the power grid.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a method for controlling<br>
a power grid connected wind turbine generator during grid faults of the kind<br>
referred to above, with which it is possible to keep the wind turbine generator<br>
magnetized and ready for delivering power to the power grid, as soon as the grid<br>
voltage is re-established after the fault, and this object is achieved with a method<br>
for controlling a power-grid connected wind turbine generator during grid faults of<br>
said kind.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for controlling a<br>
power-grid connected wind turbine generator during grid faults, said generator<br>
comprising a wind turbine driven rotor and a normally grid-connected stator, and<br>
during normal operation being connected to deliver power to the power grid, and<br>
the generator is a double-fed asynchronous generator, the rotor windings being<br>
normally connected to the grid through a back-to-back converter for transferring<br>
energy between the rotor windings and the grid in a controlled manner, said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br><br><br>
2A<br>
a)	disconnecting the stator windings from the power grid when a fault is<br>
detected,<br>
b)	connecting the stator windings to impedances for dissipating between<br>
0 and 100% of the power generated by the wind turbine during grid fault<br>
condition,<br>
c)	maintaining a certain magnetization of the generator during grid fault<br>
conditions, and<br>
d)	after removal of the grid fault condition, synchronizing the generator to the<br>
power grid and disconnecting the impedances and reconnecting the stator<br>
windings to the power grid,<br>
characterized by comprising the step of keeping the back-to-back<br>
converter connected to the grid during fault condition and controlling the back-to-<br>
back converter to deliver a controlled short-circuit contribution to the grid during<br>
fault condition.<br>
With this method, it is possible to dissipate the generated power in the<br>
impedances, whenever the generated power cannot be delivered to the power<br>
grid, due to fault conditions, such as low voltages or zero voltages on the power<br>
grid, and as soon as the power grid is re-established, the wind turbine generator<br>
can be re-connected to deliver the power to the power grid almost<br>
instantaneously.<br>
The invention also provides a power-grid connected wind turbine<br>
generator comprising a wind turbine-driven rotor, a stator, said stator during<br>
normal operation being connected to deliver power to the power grid, means for<br><br>
2B<br>
disconnecting the stator windings from the power grid when a fault is detected<br>
and means for connecting impedances to the stator windings, said impedances<br>
being dimensioned to dissipate between 0 and 100% of the power generated by<br>
the wind turbine during grid fault conditions and comprising means for<br>
maintaining a certain magnetization of the generator during disconnection and<br>
means for synchronizing the generator to the grid before reconnection to grid<br>
after fault clearance, characterized by the generator being a double fed<br>
asynchronous generator comprising a back-to-back converter connected<br>
between the rotor and the grid, and that the means for disconnecting the stator<br>
windings from the power grid do not disconnect the connection between the<br>
back-to-back converter and the power grid.<br>
Furthermore, the maintained connection between the back-to-back<br>
converter and the grid provides the possibility of delivering a certain power to the<br>
grid, thus contributing to the short circuit current in the grid necessary to activate<br>
the grid protection means for disconnecting the faulty parts of the power grid.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the method according to the invention and their<br>
advantages will be evident from the following detailed description.<br>
