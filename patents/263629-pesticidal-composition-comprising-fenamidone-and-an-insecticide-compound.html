				<td>Pesticidal composition comprising fenamidone and an insecticide compound<br>
The present invention relates to novel pesticidal compositions comprising a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative and an insecticide compound. The present invention also relates to a method of combating or controlling pests by applying at a locus infested or liable to be infested such a composition.<br>
European patent application EP-629616 discloses numerous 2-imidazolin-5-one derivatives including fenamidone, and their use as fungicide. The possibility of combining one or more of these 2-imidazolin-5-one  derivatives with known fungicidal products to develop a fungicidal activity is disclosed. No mention is made of a possible association of fenamidone with an insecticide active ingredient. International patent application WO-99/027788 discloses compositions comprising 2-imidazolin-5-one derivatives according to the present invention in mixture with other fungicide active ingredients and their use as fungicide. No mention is made of mixtures comprising fenamidone with an insecticide active ingredient. In international patent application WO-2007/101547 there are generically disclosed numerous mixtures of some phtalamide insecticide compounds with known fungicide substances. The association of these insecticide compounds with fenamidone has not been specifically disclosed nor has been subject to any experimentation. Such an association does not form part of the present invention.<br>
It is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal mixtures showing a broader scope of activity and a fungicide or insecticide synergistic effect in order notably to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients or to the mixtures of known active ingredients used by the farmer while minimising the doses of chemical products spread in the environment and reducing the cost of the treatment.<br>
We have now found some novel pesticidal compositions which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition comprising :<br>
a)	fenamidone; and<br>
b)	an insecticide compound;<br>
in a (a) / (b) weight ratio of from 1/1000 to 1000/1;<br>
provided that insecticide B compound is different from compounds of general formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
H3C (II) wherein :<br>
-	Hal represents a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or a iodine atom;<br>
-	R represents hydrogen or methyl and * may represent a carbon atom in R- or S-configuration.<br>
The composition according to the present invention provides a synergistic effect. This synergistic effect allows a reduction of the chemical substances spread into the environment and a reduction of the cost of the pesticidal treatment.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" is defined by Colby according to the article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations" Weeds, (1967), 15, pages 20-22.<br>
The latter article mentions the formula :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the pest for the combination of the two pesticides at defined doses (for example equal to x and y respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest by the compound (a) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest by the compound (b) at a defined dose (equal to y). When the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a synergistic effect.<br>
The latter article also mentions the formula :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the pest for the combination of the three pesticides at defined doses (for example equal to x, y and z respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest by the compound (a) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest by the compound (b) at a defined dose (equal to y) and z is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest by the compound (c) at a defined dose (equal to z). When the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a synergistic effect.<br>

The composition according to the present invention may further comprise an other additional component such as an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition may also comprise other additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such<br>
surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active material and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05 to 99% (by weight) of active material, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure), gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ulv) liquid, ultra low volume (ulv) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which must be diluted before they are applied to the crop.<br>
The pesticidal compositions of the present invention can be used to curatively or preventively control phytopathogenic fungi of crops but also to curatively or preventively control insects.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventively or curatively controlling phytopathogenic fungi of crops but also to curatively or preventively control insects characterised in that an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of a composition as hereinbefore defined is applied via seed treatment, foliar application, stem application or drench/drip application (chemigation) to the seed, the plant and/or to the fruit of the plant or to soil and/or to inert substrate (e.g. inorganic substrates (e.g. sand, rockwool, glasswool, expanded minerals (e.g. perlite, vermiculite, zeolite, expanded clay)), Pumice, Pyroclastic materials/tuff, synthetic organic substrates (e.g. Polyurethane), organic substrates (e.g. peat, composts, tree waste products (e.g. coir, wood fibre/chips, tree bark)) and/or to a liquid substrate (e.g. floating hydroponic systems, Nutrient Film Technique, Aeroponics) in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of composition according to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the pests and/or diseases present or liable to appear on the crops, and which does not entail any appreciable symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide range depending on the pests and diseases to be combated or controlled, the type of crop, the climatic conditions and the compounds included in the composition according to the invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the capabilities of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The method of treatment according to the present invention is useful to treat propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment can also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the present invention can also be useful to treat the overground parts of the plant such as trunks, stems or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits of the concerned plant.<br>
Among the plants that can be protected by the method according to the present invention, mention may be made of cotton; flax; vine; fruit or vegetable crops such as Rosaceae sp. (for instance pip fruit such as apples and pears, but also stone fruit such as apricots, almonds and peaches), Ribesioidae sp., Juglandaceae sp., Betulaceae sp., Anacardiaceae sp., Fagaceae sp., Moraceae sp., Oleaceae sp., Actinidaceae sp., Lauraceae sp., Musaceae sp. (for instance banana trees and plantins), Rubiaceae sp., Theaceae sp., Sterculiceae sp., Rutaceae sp. (for instance lemons, oranges and grapefruit); Solanaceae sp. (for instance tomatoes), Liliaceae sp., Asteraceae sp. (for instance lettuces), Umbelliferae sp., Cruciferae sp., Chenopodiaceae sp., Cucurbitaceae sp., Papilionaceae sp. (for instance peas), Rosaceae sp. (for instance strawberries); major crops such as Graminae sp. (for instance maize, lawn or cereals such as wheat, rice, barley and triticale), Asteraceae sp. (for instance sunflower), Cruciferae sp. (for instance colza), Fabacae sp. (for instance peanuts), Papilionaceae sp. (for instance soybean), Solanaceae sp. (for instance potatoes), Chenopodiaceae sp. (for instance beetroots); horticultural and forest crops; as well as genetically modified homologues of these crops.<br>
The method of treatment according to the invention can be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants in which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into the genome. The expression "heterologous gene" essentially means a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced in the nuclear, chloroplastic or mitochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or silencing other gene(s) which are present in the plant<br>
(using for example, antisense technology, co suppression technology or RNA interference - RNAi - technology). A heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the active compounds and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, bigger fruits, larger plant height, greener leaf color, earlier flowering, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher sugar concentration within the fruits, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
At certain application rates, the active compound combinations according to the invention may also have a strengthening effect in plants. Accordingly, they are also suitable for mobilizing the defense system of the plant against attack by unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses. This may, if appropriate, be one of the reasons of the enhanced activity of the combinations according to the invention, for example against fungi. Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances or combinations of substances which are capable of stimulating the defense system of plants in such a way that, when subsequently inoculated with unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses, the treated plants display a substantial degree of resistance to these unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses. In the present case, unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses are to be understood as meaning<br>
phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Thus, the substances according to the invention can be employed for protecting plants against attack by the abovementioned pathogens within a certain period of time after the treatment. The period of time within which protection is effected generally extends from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
Plants and plant cultivars which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which have genetic material which impart particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants (whether obtained by breeding and/or biotechno logical means).<br>
Plants and plant cultivars which are also preferably to be treated according to the invention are resistant against one or more biotic stresses, i.e. said plants show a better defense against animal and microbial pests, such as against nematodes, insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or viroids.<br>
Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention are those plants which are resistant to one or more abiotic stresses. Abiotic stress conditions may include, for example, drought, cold temperature exposure, heat exposure, osmotic stress, flooding, increased soil salinity, increased mineral exposure, ozon exposure, high light exposure, limited availability of nitrogen nutrients, limited availability of phosphorus nutrients, shade avoidance.<br>
Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention, are those plants characterized by enhanced yield characteristics. Increased yield in said plants can be the result of, for example, improved plant physiology, growth and development, such as water use efficiency, water retention efficiency, improved nitrogen use, enhanced carbon assimilation, improved photosynthesis, increased germination efficiency and accelerated maturation. Yield can furthermore be affected by improved plant architecture (under stress and non-stress conditions), including but not limited to, early flowering, flowering control for hybrid seed production, seedling vigor, plant size, internode number and distance, root growth, seed size, fruit size, pod size, pod or ear number, seed number per pod or ear, seed mass, enhanced seed<br>
filling, reduced seed dispersal, reduced pod dehiscence and lodging resistance. Further yield traits include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and composition, nutritional value, reduction in anti-nutritional compounds, improved processability and better storage stability.<br>
Plants that may be treated according to the invention are hybrid plants that already express the characteristic of heterosis or hybrid vigor which results in generally higher yield, vigor, health and resistance towards biotic and abiotic stress factors. Such plants are typically made by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male sterile plants and sold to growers. Male sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in corn) be produced by detasseling, i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs (or males flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants it is typically useful to ensure that male fertility in the hybrid plants is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male-sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described in Brassica species (WO 1992/005251, WO 1995/009910, WO 1998/27806, WO 2005/002324, WO 2006/021972 and US 6,229,072). However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 1989/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar (e.g. WO 1991/002069).<br>
Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-tolerant<br>
plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides. Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance.<br>
Herbicide-tolerant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Plants can be made tolerant to glyphosate through different means. For example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Comai et al., Science (1983), 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Barry et al., Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. (1992), 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a Petunia EPSPS (Shah et al., Science (1986), 233, 478-481), a Tomato EPSPS (Gasser et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1988),263, 4280-4289), or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 2001/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS as described in for example EP-A 0837944, WO 2000/066746, WO 2000/066747 or WO 2002/026995. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxido-reductase enzyme as described in US 5,776,760 and US 5,463,175. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme as described in for example WO 2002/036782, WO 2003/092360, WO 2005/012515 and WO 2007/024782. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the above-mentioned genes, as described in for example WO 2001/024615 or WO 2003/013226.<br>
Other herbicide resistant plants are for example plants that are made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphinothricin or glufosinate. Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition. One such efficient detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces    species).    Plants    expressing    an    exogenous    phosphinothricin<br>
acetyltransferase are for example described in US 5,561,236; US 5,648,477; US 5,646,024; US 5,273,894; US 5,637,489; US 5,276,268; US 5,739,082; US 5,908,810 and US 7,112,665.<br>
Further herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that are made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenase (HPPD). Hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is transformed into homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD-inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated HPPD enzyme as described in WO 1996/038567, WO 1999/024585 and WO 1999/024586. Tolerance to HPPD-inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite the inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD-inhibitor. Such plants and genes are described in WO 1999/034008 and WO 2002/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding an enzyme prephenate dehydrogenase in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO 2004/024928.<br>
Still further herbicide resistant plants are plants that are made tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors. Known ALS-inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. Different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, AHAS) are known to confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described for example in Tranel and Wright, Weed Science (2002), 50, 700-712, but also, in US 5,605,011, US 5,378,824, US 5,141,870, and US 5,013,659. The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants is described in US 5,605,011; US 5,013,659; US 5,141,870; US 5,767,361; US 5,731,180; US 5,304,732; US 4,761,373; US 5,331,107; US 5,928,937; and US 5,378,824; and international publication WO 1996/033270. Other imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in   for   example   WO 2004/040012,   WO 2004/106529,   WO 2005/020673,   WO<br>
2005/093093, WO 2006/007373, WO 2006/015376, WO 2006/024351, and WO 2006/060634. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in for example WO 2007/024782.<br>
Other plants tolerant to imidazolinone and/or sulfonylurea can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or mutation breeding as described for example for soybeans in US 5,084,082, for rice in WO 1997/41218, for sugar beet in US 5,773,702 and WO 1999/057965 , for lettuce in US 5,198,599, or for sunflower in WO 2001/065922.<br>
Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated according to the invention are insect-resistant transgenic plants, i.e. plants made resistant to attack by certain target insects. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such insect resistance.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
Formula for the efficacy of the combination of two compounds<br>
The expected efficacy of a given combination of two compounds is calculated as follows (see Colby, S.R., ..Calculating Synergistic and antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, pp. 20-22, 1967):<br>
If<br>
X        is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound   A   at   a   concentration   of  m   ppm   respectively   m   g/ha,<br>
Y        is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound   B   at   a   concentration   of   n   ppm   respectively   n   g/ha,<br>
E        is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control using the<br>
mixture	of A and B at m and n ppm respectively m and n g /ha,<br>
100<br>
If the observed insecticidal efficacy of the combination is higher than the one calculated as „E", then the combination of the two compounds is more than additive, i.e., there is a synergistic effect.<br>
Example A<br>
Plutella xvlostella - test<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier.	2 parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycolether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifler-containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Cabbage leaves (Brassica oleracea) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration and are infested with larvae of the diamond back moth (Plutella xylostella) as long as the leaves are still moist.<br>
After the specified period of time, the mortality in % is determined. 100 % means that all the caterpillars have been killed; 0 % means that none of the caterpillars have been killed.<br>
According to the present application in this test e.g. the following combinations of Table A show a synergistic effect in comparison to the single compounds:<br>
