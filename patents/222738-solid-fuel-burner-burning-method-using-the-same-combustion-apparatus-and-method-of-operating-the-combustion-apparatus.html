				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION <br>
SOLID FUEL BURNER, BURNING METHOD USING THE SAME,<br>
COMBUSTION APPARATUS AND METHOD OF OPERATING THE COMBUSTIONj<br>
APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a solid fuel burner for<br>
burning solid fuel by transporting the solid fuel using<br>
gas-flow, and particularly to a solid fuel burner suitable for<br>
pulverizing, transporting using gas-flow and then<br>
suspension-burning a fuel containing much moisture and<br>
volatile matters such as wood, peat, coal or the like, and a<br>
burning method using the solid fuel burner, a combustion<br>
apparatus comprising the solid fuel burner and a method of<br>
operating the combustion apparatus.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Wood, peat and coal of a low coalification rank such as<br>
blown coal and lignite which are typical thereof contain much<br>
moisture. Further, classifying fuel components into volatile<br>
matters of a component released as gas when heated, char (fixed<br>
carbon) of a component remaining as solid, ash of a component<br>
remaining as incombustible matters and moisture, these fuels<br>
contain much moisture and volatile matters and a little char.<br>
Furthermore, these fuels are low in calorific value compared<br>
to coal of a high coalification rank such as bituminous coal<br>
and anthracite, and are generally low in grindability or<br>
pulverizability. In addition, these fuels have a property of<br>
low melting temperature of combustion ash.<br>
Since these solid fuels contain much volatile matters,<br>
these solid fuels easily self-ignite in a storage process, a<br>
pulverizing process and a transportation process under air<br>
atmosphere, and accordingly are difficult to be handled<br>
compared to bituminous coal. In a case where these fuels are<br>
pulverized to be burned, a mixed gas of combustion exhaust gas<br>
and air reduced in the oxygen concentration is used as a<br>
transporting gas of the fuel in order to prevent these fuels<br>
from self-igniting. The combustion exhaust gas reduces the<br>
oxygen concentration to suppress oxidation reaction (burning)<br>
of the fuel and to prevent the fuel from self-burning. On the<br>
other hand, the retention heat of the combustion exhaust gas<br>
has an effect of drying the fuel by evaporating the water in<br>
the fuel.<br>
However, when the fuel is ejected from a solid fuel burner,<br>
the oxidation reaction of the fuel transported by the<br>
transporting gas of a low oxygen concentration is limited by<br>
the oxygen concentration around the fuel. Therefore, the<br>
combustion speed is slow compared to that in a case of fuel<br>
transported by air. Since the oxidation reaction of fuel is<br>
generally activated after the fuel is mixed with air ejected<br>
from the air nozzle, the combustion speed is determined by the<br>
mixing speed with the air. Therefore, complete burning time of<br>
the fuel is longer compared to complete burning time in a case<br>
of transporting the fuel using air, and accordingly an amount<br>
of unburned components at the exit of the combustion apparatus,<br>
that is, the furnace is increased. Further, the flame<br>
temperature is low because the combustion speed is slow. As the<br>
result, the reduction reaction of nitrogen oxides NOx to<br>
nitrogen activated in a Nox reducing zone of high temperature<br>
(about 1000 CÂ° or higher) is difficult to be used, and<br>
accordingly the concentration of NOx at the exit of the furnace<br>
becomes higher compared to the case of transporting the fuel<br>
using air.<br>
As the method of accelerating ignition of fuel<br>
transported by a transporting gas of low oxygen concentration,<br>
there is a method that an additional air nozzle is provided in<br>
the front end of a fuel nozzle to increase the oxygen<br>
concentration in the fuel transporting gas. For example, a<br>
solid fuel burner comprising an additional air nozzle outside<br>
the fuel nozzle is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. Jp -l0.-73208<br>
Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
11-148610 discloses a solid fuel burner which accelerates<br>
mixing of fuel and air at the exit of the fuel nozzle by<br>
arranging an additional air nozzle in the center of the fuel<br>
nozzle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Each of the conventional solid fuel burner described<br>
above accelerates the combustion reaction by arranging the<br>
additional air nozzle inside of the fuel nozzle to accelerate<br>
mixing of the solid fuel with air. In this case, it is preferable<br>
that the fuel jet composed of the mixed fluid of the solid fuel<br>
and the transporting gas of the solid fuel is sufficiently mixed<br>
with the air ejected from the additional air nozzle at the exit<br>
of the fuel nozzle.<br>
However, when the air ejected from the additional air<br>
nozzle is ejected in parallel to the direction of the fuel jet,<br>
the mixing between the fuel jet and the additional air becomes<br>
slow because the speed difference between the fuel jet and the<br>
additional air flow is small.<br>
In general, the distance from the exit of the additional<br>
air nozzle to the exit of the fuel nozzle is shorter than 1 m.<br>
The flow speed of the fuel jet is higher than approximately 12<br>
m/s. Therefore, the mixing time of the fuel particles with the<br>
additional air is as short as approximately 0.1 second or less,<br>
and accordingly the fuel particles can not be sufficiently<br>
mixed with the air.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the additional air<br>
nozzle is arranged upstream of the fuel nozzle in order to<br>
increase the mixing time of the fuel particles and the<br>
additional air in the fuel nozzle, there is possibility of<br>
occurrence of what is called a back-fire phenomenon in which<br>
ignition occurs inside the fuel nozzle. Therefore, the distance<br>
from the exit of the additional air nozzle to the exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle can not be lengthened.<br>
On the other hand, if part of the additional air is<br>
ejected through a tapered injection portion toward the<br>
diagonally downstream direction, as described in Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-148610, the additional air <br>
is difficult to reach the outer peripheral portion of the fuel I<br>
nozzle.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a solid<br>
fuel burner using a low oxygen concentration gas as a<br>
transporting gas of a low grade solid fuel such as brown coal<br>
or the like, which comprises a means for accelerating mixing<br>
between fuel particles and air inside a fuel nozzle and forming<br>
a zone having a fuel concentration and an oxygen concentration<br>
higher than average values of a fuel concentration and an oxygen<br>
concentration in the fuel nozzle to stably burn the fuel over<br>
a wide range from a high load condition to a low load condition<br>
without changing a distance from an exit of an additional air<br>
nozzle to an exit of a fuel nozzle.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
burning method using the solid fuel burner comprising the means<br>
for accelerating mixing between fuel particles and air to<br>
stably burn the fuel, a combustion apparatus comprising the<br>
solid fuel burner and a method of operating the combustion<br>
apparatus.<br>
In order to attain the above objects, the present<br>
invention proposes a solid fuel burner comprising a fuel nozzle<br>
for ejecting a mixed fluid of a solid fuel and a transporting<br>
gas; an additional air nozzle for ejecting air into the fuel<br>
nozzle in a direction nearly perpendicular to a flow direction<br>
of the mixed fluid; and at least one outer-side air nozzle for<br>
ejecting air, the outer-side air nozzle being arranged outside<br>
of the fuel nozzle, wherein the exit of the additional air<br>
nozzle is arranged at a position in the burner upstream of an<br>
exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
The additional air nozzle may be arranged in the central<br>
portion of the fuel nozzle, or may be arranged in a separation<br>
wall portion for separating the fuel nozzle from the outer-<br>
side air nozzle.<br>
It is also possible to employ a burning method using the<br>
solid fuel burner that when a combustion load is low, an amount<br>
of air supplied from the additional air nozzle is increased,<br>
and an amount of air supplied from the outer-side air nozzle<br>
closest to a fuel nozzle among the outer-side air nozzles is<br>
decreased or a swirling speed is increased; and when a<br>
combustion load is high, the amount of air supplied from the<br>
additional air nozzle is decreased, and the amount of air<br>
supplied from the outer-side air nozzle closest to the fuel<br>
nozzle among the outer-side air nozzles is increased or a<br>
swirling intensity is decreased.<br>
The solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention is a solid fuel burner comprising a fuel nozzle for<br>
ejecting a mixed fluid of a solid fuel and a transporting gas;<br>
an additional air nozzle for ejecting air into the fuel nozzle<br>
in a direction nearly perpendicular to a flow direction of the<br>
mixed fluid; and at least one outer-side air nozzle for ejecting<br>
air, the outer-side air nozzle being arranged outside of the<br>
fuel nozzle, wherein the exit of the additional air nozzle is<br>
arranged at a position in the burner upstream of an exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle.<br>
The additional air nozzle may be arranged in the central<br>
portion of the fuel nozzle, or in the separation wall of the<br>
outer-side air nozzle.<br>
When the additional air jet ejected from the additional<br>
air nozzle is ejected nearly perpendicular to the direction of<br>
the fuel jet, the mixing between the fuel jet and the additional<br>
air is progressed because the speed difference between the fuel<br>
particles and the additional air jet is larger than the speed<br>
difference in the case where the additional air jet ejected from<br>
the additional air nozzle is ejected in parallel to the<br>
direction of the fuel jet. Particularly, since the specific<br>
density of the fuel particle is larger than that of gas, the<br>
fuel particles are mixed into the additional air jet by an<br>
inertia force.<br>
At that time, since the low oxygen concentration<br>
transporting gas around the fuel particles is separated from<br>
the fuel particles, the oxygen concentration around the fuel<br>
particles becomes higher than the oxygen concentration of the<br>
transporting gas. Therefore, after ejected from the fuel nozzle,<br>
the combustion reaction is accelerated by the high oxygen<br>
concentration, and accordingly flame is stably formed at the<br>
exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
At that time, by ejecting air from the additional air<br>
nozzle toward the direction nearly perpendicular to the flow<br>
direction of the fuel jet to increase the oxygen concentration<br>
along the outer partition wall inner periphery of the fuel<br>
nozzle, a high fuel concentration and high oxygen concentration<br>
region is formed along the outer partition wall inner periphery<br>
of the fuel nozzle. As the result, after ejected from the fuel<br>
nozzle, combustion reaction is progressed by the high oxygen<br>
concentration to stably form a flame at the exit of the fuel<br>
nozzle.<br>
The pulverized coal flowing along near the inner wall<br>
surface of the fuel nozzle is increased to have a chance to be<br>
in contact with the air ejected from the outer-side air nozzle<br>
near the exit of the fuel nozzle. Further, the pulverized coal<br>
is apt to be ignited in contact with a high temperature gas of<br>
a circulation flow formed in the downstream side of a flame<br>
stabilizing ring to be described later.<br>
The additional air nozzle may eject air from the<br>
separation wall in the periphery toward the center, or may eject<br>
air from the inner portion of the fuel nozzle toward the outer<br>
side.<br>
The additional air nozzle is preferable arranged at the<br>
portion where the flow passage of the fuel nozzle expands. The<br>
inertia force of the fuel particles is strong compared to the<br>
inertia force of a gas. By arranging the exit of the additional<br>
air nozzle in the flow passage expanding portion where the<br>
velocity component from the flow passage toward the wall<br>
surface is hardly induced, it is possible to suppress the fuel<br>
particles to enter into or be accumulated in the additional air<br>
nozzle.<br>
Further, the present invention proposes a solid fuel<br>
burner comprising a fuel nozzle for ejecting a mixed fluid of<br>
a solid fuel and a transporting gas; at least one air nozzle<br>
for ejecting air, the air nozzle being arranged outside the fuel<br>
nozzle; an additional air nozzle for ejecting air into the fuel<br>
nozzle in a direction nearly perpendicular to a flow direction<br>
of the mixed fluid; and a separator for dividing a flow passage,<br>
the separator being arranged in the fuel nozzle, wherein the<br>
transporting gas is a gas having an oxygen concentration lower<br>
than the oxygen concentration of air, and an exit of the<br>
additional air nozzle is in a position where the exit overlaps<br>
with the separator when the exit is seen from a direction<br>
vertical to an axis of the burner.<br>
It is possible to provide an obstacle inside the fuel<br>
nozzle, the obstacle being composed of a portion contracting<br>
and a portion expanding the cross-sectional area of a flow<br>
passage inside the fuel nozzle, the portions being arranged in<br>
order of the contracting portion and the expanding portion from<br>
an upstream side of the burner.<br>
In an end portion upstream of the separator in the flow<br>
passage of the fuel nozzle divided by the separator, a<br>
cross-sectional area of the flow passage in the side of<br>
arranging the additional air nozzle may be made larger than a<br>
cross-sectional area of the flow passage contracted by the<br>
obstacle.<br>
The additional air nozzle is sometimes arranged in an<br>
outer separation wall portion of the fuel nozzle.<br>
It is possible that the separator is formed of a<br>
cylindrical or a tapered thin plate structure, and the solid<br>
fuel burner comprises a flow passage contracting member<br>
upstream of the separator, the flow passage contracting member<br>
contracting the flow passage from the outer peripheral side of<br>
the fuel nozzle; and a concentrator downstream of the flow<br>
passage contracting member, the concentrator contracting the<br>
flow passage from the side of the center axis of the fuel nozzle.<br>
In any one of the solid fuel burners described above, the<br>
solid fuel burner may comprises an obstacle in a front end of<br><br>
a separation wall for separating said fuel nozzle and the air<br>
nozzle, the obstacle blocking a flow of the solid fuel and the<br>
transporting gas of the solid fuel ejected from the fuel nozzle<br>
and a flow of the air ejected from the air nozzle. The obstacle<br>
is sometimes a toothed flame stabilizing ring arranged on a wall<br>
surface in the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
A swirler may be arranged in the air nozzle.<br>
A guide for determining a direction of ejecting air may<br>
be arranged in the exit of the air nozzle.<br>
In these burning methods using the solid fuel burner, it<br>
is possible to employ the burning method using the solid fuel<br>
burner that when a combustion load is low, an amount of air<br>
supplied from the additional air nozzle is increased; and when<br>
the combustion load is high, the amount of air supplied from<br>
the additional air nozzle is decreased.<br>
Sometimes employed is a burning method using the solid<br>
fuel burner, in which when a combustion load is low, an amount<br>
of air supplied from the additional air nozzle is increased and<br>
a flow rate of air supplied from the air nozzle is decreased,<br>
and when a combustion load is high, the amount of air supplied<br>
from the additional air nozzle is decreased and the flow rate<br>
of air supplied from the air nozzle is increased, whereby the<br>
ratio of the amount of air to the amount of fuel supplied from<br>
the solid fuel burner is kept constant.<br>
It is possible to employ the burning method using the<br>
solid fuel burner, in which at the exit cross-section of the<br>
fuel nozzle, a zone having a fuel concentration and an oxygen<br>
concentration both higher than average values of a fuel<br>
concentration and an oxygen concentration is formed in the<br>
central zone or the peripheral zone; and a zone having a fuel<br>
concentration and an oxygen concentration both lower than the<br>
average values of the fuel concentration and the oxygen<br>
concentration is formed in the peripheral zone or the central<br>
zone, respectively. For example, in a case where the air nozzle<br>
is arranged in the outer periphery of the fuel nozzle, it is<br>
preferable that at the exit cross-section of the fuel nozzle,<br>
an outer peripheral zone having a fuel concentration and an<br>
oxygen concentration both higher than average values of a fuel<br>
concentration and an oxygen concentration is formed,<br>
respectively; and a central zone having a fuel concentration<br>
and an oxygen concentration both lower than the average values<br>
of the fuel concentration and the oxygen concentration is<br>
formed, respectively.<br>
Further, the present invention proposes a combustion<br>
apparatus, which comprises a furnace having a plurality of any<br>
one kind of the solid fuel burners described above, a hopper,<br>
a coal feeder, a pulverizer fed with fuel which is mixed with<br>
combustion exhaust gas extracted from an upper portion of the<br>
combustion apparatus and inside a combustion exhaust gas pipe<br>
downstream of the coal feeder, a fuel pipe for feeding fuel<br>
pulverized by the pulverizer to the solid fuel burners, and a<br>
blower for supplying air to the solid fuel burners.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention proposes a combustion<br>
apparatus, which comprises a furnace having a plurality of any<br>
one kind of the solid fuel burners described above; a hopper;<br>
a coal feeder; a pulverizer fed with fuel which is mixed with<br>
combustion exhaust gas extracted from an upper portion of the<br>
combustion apparatus and inside a combustion exhaust gas pipe<br>
downstream of the coal feeder; a fuel pipe for feeding fuel<br>
pulverized by the pulverizer to the solid fuel burners; a blower<br>
for supplying air to the solid fuel burners; a low load flame<br>
detector or a thermometer or a radiation pyrometer for<br>
monitoring a flame formed in each of the solid fuel burners<br>
under a low load condition; a high load flame detector or a<br>
thermometer or a radiation pyrometer for monitoring flames<br>
formed in a position distant from the solid fuel burners under<br>
a high load condition; and control means for controlling<br>
supplied an amount of the air ejected from the additional air<br>
nozzle based on a signal from the measurement instruments.<br>
A method of operating the combustion apparatus employed<br>
is that when the combustion apparatus is operated with a high<br>
combustion load, the flame of the solid fuel is formed in a<br>
position distant from the solid fuel burner; and when the<br>
combustion apparatus is operated with a low combustion load,<br>
the flame of the solid fuel is formed in a position just after<br>
the exit of the fuel nozzle of the solid fuel burner.<br>
The present invention proposes a boiler plant, which<br>
comprises a furnace having a plurality of any one kind of the<br>
solid fuel burners described above on wall surfaces; and a heat<br>
exchanger for generating steam by heating water using<br>
combustion heat generated by combustion of the solid fuel in<br>
the furnace, the heat exchanger being arranged on the walls of<br>
the furnace and inside the furnace.<br>
The solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention is particularly suitable for a case where a<br>
transporting gas has an oxygen concentration lower than 21 %<br>
when a solid fuel containing much mpoisture and volatile<br>
matters such as blown coal, lignite or the like, wood or peat<br>
is pulverized, transported using fluid flow and suspension-<br>
burned .<br>
The solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention is a solid fuel burner comprising a fuel nozzle for<br>
ejecting a mixed fluid of a solid fuel and a transporting gas;<br>
at least one air nozzle for ejecting air, the air nozzle being<br>
arranged outside the fuel nozzle; an additional air nozzle for<br>
ejecting air into the fuel nozzle in a direction nearly<br>
perpendicular to a flow direction of the mixed fluid; and a<br>
separator for dividing a flow passage, the separator being<br>
arranged in the fuel nozzle, wherein the transporting gas is<br>
a gas having an oxygen concentration lower than the oxygen<br>
concentration of air, and an exit of the additional air nozzle<br>
is in a position where the exit overlaps with the separator when<br>
the exit is seen from a direction vertical to an axis of the<br>
burner.<br>
The additional air nozzle may be arranged in the central<br>
portion of the fuel nozzle, or in the separation wall of the<br>
outer-side air nozzle. From the viewpoint of preventing<br>
abrasion caused by the fuel particles, it is preferable that<br>
the additional air nozzle is arranged on the separation wall<br>
of the fuel nozzle.<br>
When the additional air jet ejected from the additional<br>
air nozzle is ejected nearly perpendicular to the direction of<br>
the fuel jet, the mixing between the fuel jet and the additional<br>
air is progressed because the speed difference between the fuel<br>
particles and the additional air jet is larger than the speed<br>
difference in the case where the additional air jet ejected from<br>
the additional air nozzle is ejected in parallel to the<br>
direction of the fuel jet. Particularly, since the specific<br>
density of the fuel particle is larger than that of air, the<br>
fuel particles are mixed into the additional air jet by an<br>
inertia force.<br>
In the present invention, since an exit of the additional<br>
air nozzle is in the position where the exit overlaps with the<br>
separator when the exit is seen from the direction vertical to<br>
the axis of the burner, the additional air jet ejected from the<br>
additional air nozzle is mixed into only the flow passage in<br>
the additional air side interposed between the additional air<br>
nozzle and the separator in the fuel nozzle because the<br>
separator obstacles the flow. Since the additional air jet is<br>
mixed with the fuel jet in the additional air flow passage, the<br>
flow resistance to the flow of the fuel jet is increased.<br>
Therefore, when the flow rate of the additional air is increased,<br>
the transporting gas flows by avoiding the additional air flow<br>
passage.<br>
However, the fuel particles have a stronger tendency to<br>
flow straight due to the inertia force compared to gas, the fuel<br>
particles flow at the additional air flow passage side. In the<br>
additional air flow passage side of the separator, the decrease<br>
in the fuel particles is smaller compared to the decrease in<br>
the flow rate of the transporting gas.<br>
As the result, the transporting gas is replaced by the<br>
additional air jet, and accordingly the oxygen concentration<br>
around the fuel particles becomes higher then the oxygen<br>
concentration of the transporting gas. After ejected from the<br>
fuel nozzle, the combustion reaction is progressed by the high<br>
oxygen concentration to stably form a flame at the exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle.<br>
In order to prevent back fire or burnout by forming flame<br>
inside the fuel nozzle, it is preferable that the fuel retention<br>
time in the fuel nozzle is shorter than the ignition lag time<br>
of the fuel (approximately 0.1 second). Since; the fuel<br>
transporting gas generally flows inside the fuel nozzle at a<br>
flow speed of 12 to 20 m/s, the distance from the exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle to the exit of the additional air nozzle is shorter<br>
than 1 m.<br>
It is preferable to arrange a flow passage contracting<br>
member in the fuel nozzle of the solid fuel burner in accordance<br>
with the present invention. By the flow passage contracting<br>
member, the flow passage cross-sectional area of the fuel<br>
nozzle is from the upstream side of the burner once contracted<br>
and successively expanded to the original size. Since the flow<br>
speed of the fuel transporting gas flowing inside the fuel<br>
nozzle is increased by contracting the flow passage cross-<br>
sectional area, it is possible to prevent back, fire from<br>
propagating up to a portion upstream of the flow passage<br>
contracting member even if flame is formed inside the fuel<br>
nozzle due to occurrence of instantaneous reduction in the flow<br>
speed.<br>
Therein, it is preferable that in order to decrease the<br>
flow resistance of the fuel transporting gas, the flow passage<br>
contracting member has a shape of smoothly varying the flow<br>
passage cross-sectional area such as a venturi.<br>
Further, by providing the inside of the fuel nozzle with<br>
the concentrator composed of the portion contracting and the<br>
portion expanding the flow passage cross-sectional area inside<br>
the fuel nozzle arranged in this order from the upstream side<br>
of the burner, a velocity component flowing toward the outer<br>
peripheral direction along the concentrator is induced in the<br>
fuel particles. Since the inertia force of the fuel particle<br>
is larger than that of the transporting gas, the fuel particles<br>
unevenly flow along near the inner wall surface of the fuel<br>
nozzle to reach the exit of the nozzle. As the result, a<br>
fuel-condensed jet is formed on the inner wall surface of the<br>
fuel nozzle.<br>
Therein, in the case where the exit of the additional air<br>
nozzle is in the position where the exit overlaps with the<br>
separator when the exit is seen from the direction vertical to<br>
the axis of the burner, by ejecting air from the additional air<br>
nozzle toward the direction nearly perpendicular to the flow<br>
direction of the fuel jet to increase the oxygen concentration<br>
along the inner wall surface of the fuel nozzle, a high fuel<br>
concentration and high oxygen concentration region is formed<br>
along the inner wall surface of the fuel nozzle. As the result,<br>
after ejected from the fuel nozzle, combustion reaction is<br>
progressed by the high oxygen concentration to stably form a<br>
flame at the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
The fuel particles flowing along the inner periphery of<br>
the outer side separation wall of the fuel nozzle are mixed with<br>
the air ejected from the air nozzle in the outer side of the<br>
fuel nozzle at a position near the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
Further, the pulverized coal is apt to be ignited in contact<br>
with a high temperature gas of a circulation flow formed in the<br>
downstream side of a flame stabilizing ring to be described<br>
later.<br>
As described above, there is a method that the oxygen<br>
concentration of the mixed fluid of the fuel and the<br>
transporting gas flowing in the outer side flow passage between<br>
the flow passages divided by the separator provided in the fuel<br>
nozzle is increased by arranging additional air nozzles on the<br>
inner periphery of the outer side separation wall of the fuel<br>
nozzle and ejecting the additional air toward the center axis<br>
of the burner.<br>
On the other hand, the same effect can be obtained by a<br>
method that the oxygen concentration of the mixed fluid of the<br>
fuel and the transporting gas flowing in the inner side flow<br>
passage between the flow passages divided by the separator<br>
provided in the fuel nozzle is increased by arranging<br>
additional air nozzles on the outer periphery of the inner side<br>
separation wall of the fuel nozzle and ejecting the additional<br>
air outward from the center axis of the burner.<br>
It is preferable that the obstacle (flame stabilizing<br>
ring) for interfering with flow of the solid fuel mixture and<br>
the air ejected from the fuel nozzles is arranged in the front<br>
end portion of the separation wall between the fuel nozzle and<br>
the outer-side air nozzle. Pressure is decreased in the<br>
downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring to form<br>
circulation flow flowing from the downstream side to the<br>
upstream side. Inside the circulation flow, the air, the fuel<br>
and the fuel transporting gas ejected from a group of nozzles<br>
in the outer side, and the high temperature gas from the<br>
downstream side are stagnated. As the result, temperature<br>
inside the circulation flow becomes high to act as an ignition<br>
source of the fuel jet. Therefore, the flame is stably formed<br>
from the exit portion of the fuel nozzle.<br>
When the toothed flame stabilizing ring is arranged in<br>
the exit of the fuel nozzle in a direction of blocking the fuel<br>
jet, disturbance of the fuel jet is increased by the flame<br>
stabilizing ring to mix the fuel jet with air, the combustion<br>
reaction is progressed, and the ignition of the fuel is<br>
accelerated.<br>
The solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention is capable of varying an amount of air ejected from<br>
the additional air nozzle corresponding to a combustion load.<br>
When a combustion load is low, the amount of air ejected<br>
from the additional air nozzle is increased. In this case, since<br>
the oxygen concentration inside the fuel nozzle is increased<br>
by the air ejected from the additional air nozzle, the<br>
combustion reaction of the fuel is accelerated more than in the<br>
case of low oxygen concentration, and accordingly ignition of<br>
the fuel is advanced to form flame at a position near the fuel<br>
nozzle.<br>
When the combustion load is high, the amount of air<br>
supplied from the additional air nozzle is decreased. In this<br>
case, since the oxygen concentration inside the fuel nozzle is<br>
low, the combustion reaction of the fuel is not accelerated,<br>
and accordingly flame is formed at a position inside the<br>
combustion apparatus distant from the fuel nozzle.<br>
When the temperature of the solid fuel burner or the wall<br>
of the combustion apparatus outside the solid fuel burner is<br>
excessively high, combustion ash attaches onto the structures<br>
of the solid fuel burner and the wall of the furnace to cause<br>
a phenomenon called as slugging in which the attached substance<br>
is growing.<br>
In the present invention, as the flame separates from the<br>
solid fuel burner, the temperature of the solid fuel burner or<br>
the wall of the combustion apparatus outside the solid fuel<br>
burner decreases, whereby occurrence of the slugging can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
By changing the amount of air ejected from the additional<br>
air nozzle based on signals from the thermometer or the<br>
radiation pyrometer or the flame detector arranged in the solid<br>
fuel burner or on a wall of the furnace around the; solid fuel<br>
burner, the position of forming the flames of the solid fuel<br>
burners can be controlled.<br>
The description on the above has been made on the case<br>
where the melting point of the combustion ash of the solid fuel<br>
is low, and accordingly the slugging is apt to occur. In the<br>
case where the melting point of the combustion ash of the solid<br>
fuel is low or the thermal load of the furnace is low, and<br>
accordingly slugging is not a problem, the flame of the solid<br>
fuel burner may be formed from the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
On the other hand, when the combustion load is low, the<br>
amount of air is preferably controlled so that a ratio of the<br>
total amount of air supplied from the additional air nozzle and<br>
supplied from the additional air nozzle to the amount of air<br>
necessary for completely burning the volatile matters, that is,<br>
a ratio of the air to the volatile matters may becomes 0.85 to<br>
0.95.<br>
When the combustion load is low, it is difficult to keep<br>
stable combustion. Therefore, by setting the ratio of air to<br>
the volatile to 0.85 to 0.95, it is easy to keep stable<br>
combustion. The amount of radiant heat to the solid-fuel nozzle<br>
and the wall of the combustion apparatus can be controlled by<br>
varying the amount of air to change the position of forming<br>
flame inside the combustion apparatus.<br>
Under the high load condition, it is preferable that the<br>
flame is formed at a position distant from the solid fuel burner<br>
because the thermal load in the combustion apparatus is high.<br>
According to the combustion method using the solid fuel<br>
burner in accordance with the present invention, under the high<br>
load condition of the combustion apparatus, the fuel is ignited<br>
at a position distant from the solid fuel burner, and the flame<br>
is formed in the central portion of the combustion apparatus.<br>
In order to monitor the flame formed under the high load<br>
condition, it is preferable to monitor the flame in the central<br>
portion of the combustion apparatus where the flames of the<br>
solid fuel burners gather.<br>
Under the low load condition, since the thermal load<br>
inside the combustion apparatus is low, the temperature of the<br>
solid fuel burner and the wall of the combustion apparatus<br>
around the solid fuel burner is lower than the temperature under<br>
the high load condition, and accordingly the slugging hardly<br>
occurs even if the flame is brought close to the solid fuel<br>
burner.<br>
Under the low load condition of the combustion apparatus,<br>
the fuel is ignited near the solid fuel burner to form flame.<br>
At that time, the flames are formed burner-by-burner by the<br>
individual solid fuel burners, and the frames are sometimes<br>
separately formed inside the combustion apparatus. Further,<br>
the temperature in the furnace is lower compared to that under<br>
the high load condition, the time of complete burning of the<br>
fuel becomes long. Therefore, if the flame departs from the<br>
solid fuel burner, the fuel can not completely burned before<br>
reaching the exit of the furnace, which causes decrease of the<br>
combustion efficiency and increase of an amount of unburned<br>
fuel. Therefore, it is preferable that each of the flames formed<br>
at the exits of the individual solid fuel burners is monitored.<br>
In the solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the outer side air can be ejected expanding from the<br>
center axis of the burner by providing the air nozzle (the outer<br>
side air nozzle) outside the fuel nozzle and providing the guide<br>
for determining the ejecting direction of the outer side air<br>
at the exit of the outer side air nozzle. In the case of such<br>
a structure, the speed of the fuel is decreased near the burner<br>
because the fuel is expanded along the outer side air, and<br>
accordingly the retention time near the solid fuel burner is<br>
increased. As the result, the combustion efficiency in the<br>
furnace can be improved and the amount of unburned fuel can be<br>
decreased by increases of the retention time of the fuel in the<br>
furnace.<br>
By adjusting the guide for guiding the jet from the<br>
outermost side air nozzle arranged in the outermost side to set<br>
an angle so that the outer side air jet may flow along the<br>
individual solid fuel burners and the wall of the combustion<br>
apparatus existing outside the solid fuel burners, the outer<br>
side air can cool the individual solid fuel burners and the wall<br>
of the combustion apparatus existing outside the solid fuel<br>
burners to suppress occurrence of the slugging.<br>
As the combustion apparatus having the plurality of solid<br>
fuel burners in accordance with the present invention on the<br>
wall surface of the combustion apparatus, there are a coal-<br>
fired boiler, a peat-fired boiler, a biomass-fired boiler (a<br>
wood-fired boiler) and so on.<br>
By arranging the thermometers or the radiation<br>
pyrometers in the solid fuel burners in accordance with the<br>
present invention or on the wall surface of the furnace existing<br>
outside the solid fuel burners, the combustion apparatus is<br>
operated so as to varying the amount of air ejected from the<br>
additional air nozzle of the solid fuel burner. By doing so,<br>
the flames are controlled so as to be individually formed at<br>
appropriate positions in the combustion apparatus<br>
corresponding to the combustion load change.<br>
The index of whether or not the flames are formed in the<br>
appropriate positions is determined, for example, as follows.<br>
That is, the furnace is operated so that the front end of the<br>
solid fuel flame inside the furnace may be formed at a position<br>
near the wall surface of the furnace outside the exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle when the furnace is operated under the low load<br>
condition, and so that the flame may be formed at a position<br>
in the furnace 0.5 m or more distant from the exist of the fuel<br>
nozzle when the furnace is operated under the high load<br>
condition.<br>
The combustion apparatus is appropriately operated by<br>
monitoring using a flame detector or visually the flames in the<br>
central portion or the vicinity in the combustion apparatus<br>
where the flames of the solid fuel burners in accordance with<br>
the present invention gather when the combustion apparatus is<br>
operated under the high load condition, and by monitoring the<br>
individual flames formed in the exits of the solid fuel burners<br>
in accordance with the present invention when the combustion<br>
apparatus is operated under the low load condition.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the solid fuel burner, the combustion<br>
method using the solid fuel burner, the combustion apparatus<br>
having the solid fuel burners and the operating method of the<br>
combustion apparatus in accordance with the present invention<br>
will be described below, referring to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT 1<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing the structure<br>
of an embodiment 1 of the solid fuel burner in accordance with<br>
the present invention, and the view shows a state in which the<br>
flame 20 of the solid fuel burner is formed near a circulation<br>
flow 19 in the downstream side of a flame stabilizing ring 23<br>
when the embodiment 1 of the solid fuel burner is used under<br>
a low load condition. FIG. 2 is a schematic view showing the<br>
structure of the embodiment 1 of the solid fuel burner, viewed<br>
from the inner side of the furnace 41.<br>
The solid fuel burner of the present embodiment 1<br>
comprises a combustion improving oil gun 24 in the central<br>
portion; and a fuel nozzle 11 for ejecting the mixed fluid of<br>
the fuel and the transporting gas of the fuel around the<br>
combustion improving gun 24. A plurality of additional air<br>
nozzles 12 are arranged so that the nozzle exits are directed<br>
from an outer side separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11<br>
toward the center axis of the solid fuel burner.<br>
The combustion improving gun 24 arranged so as to<br>
penetrate the central portion of the fuel nozzle is used for<br>
igniting the fuel at starting the solid fuel burner.<br>
In the fuel nozzle 11, there are arranged a flow passage<br>
contracting member (a venturi) 32, an obstacle (a concentrator)<br>
33 and a separator 3 5 in this order from the upstream side. The<br>
additional air nozzles 12 are set in a direction that the air<br>
ejected toward the outer side separation wall 22 of the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 becomes nearly perpendicular to the flow of the mixed<br>
fluid flowing in the fuel nozzle 11. Therefore, the exit of the<br>
additional air nozzle 12 is in a position where the exit<br>
overlaps with the separator 35 when the exit is seen from a<br>
direction vertical to an axis of the burner.<br>
Outside of the fuel nozzle 11, there are the annular outer<br>
side air nozzles (a secondary air nozzle 13, a tertiary air<br>
nozzle 14) for ejecting air, and the annular outer side air<br>
nozzles are concentric to the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
An obstacle called as a flame stabilizing ring 23 is<br>
arranged in the front end portion of the fuel nozzle, that is,<br>
in the exit side to the furnace. The flame stabilizing ring 23<br>
serves as an obstacle to the fuel jet 16 composed of the fuel<br>
and the transporting gas ejected from the fuel nozzle 11 and<br>
the secondary air flow 17 flowing through the secondary air<br>
nozzle 13. Therefore, the pressure in the downstream side of<br>
the flame stabilizing ring 23, that is, in the combustion<br>
apparatus 41 side is decreased, and flow toward the direction<br>
opposite to the direction of the fuel jet 16 and the secondary<br>
air flow is induced. The opposite direction flow is defined as<br>
a circulation flow 19.<br>
High temperature gas produced by combustion of fuel flows<br>
into the inside of the circulation flow 19 from the downstream<br>
side, and is stagnated in the circulation flow 19. As the high<br>
temperature gas and the fuel in the fuel jet 16 are mixed at<br>
the exit of the solid fuel burner, the temperature of the fuel<br>
particles are increased by the radiant heat from the inside of<br>
the furnace 41 to be ignited.<br>
The secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary air nozzle<br>
14 are separated from each other by a separating wall 29, and<br>
the front end portion of the separating wall 29 is formed in<br>
a guide 29a for ejecting the flow of the tertiary air 18 so as<br>
to have an angle to the fuel jet 16. If a guide 25, 29a for<br>
guiding the ejecting direction of the air toward the direction<br>
departing from the center axis of the burner is arranged at the<br>
exit of the flow passages of the outer air nozzles (the<br>
secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary air nozzle 14), the<br>
guide is useful for easily forming the circulation flow 19,<br>
together with the flame stabilizing ring 23.<br>
In order to add swirling force to the air ejected from<br>
the secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary air nozzle 14,<br>
swirlers 27 and 28 are arranged in the secondary air nozzle 13<br>
and the tertiary air 14.<br>
A burner throat 30 composing the wall of the furnace also<br>
serves as an outer peripheral wall of the tertiary air nozzle.<br>
Water pipes 31 are arranged in the wall of the furnace.<br>
In the present embodiment 1, the oxygen concentration in<br>
the fuel jet 16 flowing through the fuel nozzle 11 is lowered<br>
using the combustion exhaust gas for the transporting gas of<br>
the fuel. As an example to which such a combustion method is<br>
applied, there is combustion of coal such as blown coal or<br>
lignite which is typical of a low coalification rank, peat or<br>
wood.<br>
These kinds of fuels are low in calorific value compared<br>
to coal of a high coalification rank such as bituminous coal<br>
and anthracite, and are generally low in grindability or<br>
pulverizability. Furthermore, combustion ash of these solid<br>
fuels is low in melting temperature. Since these solid fuels<br>
contain much volatile matters, these solid fuels easily<br>
self-ignite in a storage process and a pulverizing process<br>
under air atmosphere, and accordingly are difficult to be<br>
handled compared to bituminous coal. In a case where blown coal<br>
or lignite is pulverized to be burned, a mixed gas of combustion<br>
exhaust gas and air is used as a transporting gas of the fuel<br>
in order to prevent these fuels from self-igniting. The<br>
combustion exhaust gas reduces the oxygen concentration and<br>
suppressing oxidizing reaction (burning) to prevent the fuel<br>
from self-burning. On the other hand, the retention heat of the<br>
combustion exhaust gas can be used for drying the fuel by<br>
evaporating the moisture in the fuel.<br>
When the fuel is ejected from a solid fuel burner, the<br>
oxidation reaction of the fuel transported by the transporting<br>
gas of a low oxygen concentration is limited by the oxygen<br>
concentration around the fuel. Therefore, the combustion speed<br>
is slow compared to that in a case of fuel transported by air.<br>
Since the oxidation reaction of fuel is generally activated<br>
after the fuel is mixed with air ejected from the air nozzle,<br>
the combustion speed is determined by the mixing speed with the<br>
air. Therefore, when fuel such as blown coal or lignite is<br>
burned under the low load condition of the solid fuel burner<br>
in which the combustion amount of fuel is small, blow-off or<br>
flameout of the flame 20 occur more often compared to the case<br>
of combustion of bituminous coal. Further, complete burning<br>
time of the fuel is longer compared to complete burning time<br>
in a case of transporting the fuel using air, and accordingly<br>
an amount of unburned components or carbons at the exit of the<br>
furnace 41 is increased. Further, the flame temperature is low<br>
because the combustion speed is slow. As the result, the<br>
reduction reaction of nitrogen oxides NOx to nitrogen under the<br>
reduction atmosphere of high temperature above 1000 CÂ° is<br>
difficult to be used, and accordingly the concentration of NOx<br>
at the exit of the furnace becomes higher compared to the case<br>
of transporting the fuel using air.<br>
The present embodiment 1 has the additional air nozzles<br>
12 for ejecting air toward the direction nearly perpendicular<br>
to the flow direction of the fuel jet inside the fuel nozzle.<br>
When the additional air jet 21 to be ejected from the additional<br>
air nozzle 12 is ejected toward the direction nearly<br>
perpendicular to the flow direction of the fuel jet, the mixing<br>
between the fuel jet and the additional air is progressed<br>
because the speed difference between the fuel particles and the<br>
additional air jet is larger than the speed difference in the<br>
case where the additional air jet to be ejected from the<br>
additional air nozzle is ejected in parallel to the direction<br>
of the fuel jet. Particularly, since the specific density of<br>
the fuel particles is larger than that of air, the fuel<br>
particles are mixed into the additional air jet by an inertia<br>
force.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment 1, the exit of the<br>
additional air nozzle 12 is in a position where the exit<br>
overlaps with the separator 35 when the exit is seen from a<br>
direction vertical to an axis of the burner. Therefore, the<br>
ejecting direction is blocked by the separator 35, and<br>
accordingly the additional air jet 21 is not expanded to the<br>
inner side flow passage 36 of the separator 35 to flow through<br>
the outer side flow passage 37.<br>
The flow resistance of the outer side flow passage 3 7 of<br>
the separator 35 is large compared to the flow resistance of<br>
the inner side flow passage 36 because the additional air jet<br>
21 is mixed. When the amount of the additional air is increased,<br>
the amount of the transporting gas flowing through the outer<br>
side flow passage 3 7 of the separator 35 is decreased. On the<br>
other hand, since the fuel particles flow into the outer side<br>
flow passage 3 7 irrespective of the flow resistance because of<br>
the inertia force larger than that of the gas, the amount of<br>
the fuel particles flowing through the outer side flow passage<br>
37 of the separator 35 is almost unchanged.<br>
Therefore, when the amount of the additional air is<br>
increased, the amount of the transporting gas entering into the<br>
outer side flow passage 37 together with the fuel particles is<br>
decreased. Since the transporting gas is replaced by the<br>
additional air, dilution of the oxygen concentration is smaller<br>
compared to simply mixing between the transporting gas and the<br>
additional air, and accordingly the oxygen concentration<br>
becomes high. Further, the separator 35 can prevent the fuel<br>
particles from being dispersed by disturbance produced at<br>
mixing of the additional air and the transporting gas.<br>
Therefore, in the outer side flow passage 37 of the separator<br>
35, the oxygen concentration is high and the fuel density is<br>
also high.<br>
According to the present embodiment 1, the combustion<br>
reaction is easily progressed after ejected from the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 by the high oxygen concentration and the high fuel<br>
density, and the flame 20 can be stably formed at the exit of<br>
the fuel nozzle.<br>
In order to prevent back fire or burnout by forming flame<br>
20 inside the fuel nozzle 11, it is preferable that the distance<br>
from the exit of the additional air nozzle 12 to the exit of<br>
the fuel nozzle is determined so that the retention time after<br>
mixing of the fuel jet with the additional air flow 21 may be<br>
shorter than the ignition time lag of the fuel. In general, the<br>
index is the ignition time lag of a gas fuel (approximately 0.1<br>
second) which is shorter than the ignition time lag of<br>
pulverized coal. Since the fuel transporting gas generally<br>
flows inside the fuel nozzle at a flow speed of 12 to 20 m/s,<br>
the distance from the exit of the additional air nozzle 12 to<br>
the exit of the fuel nozzle 11 is shorter than lm.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment 1, a flow passage<br>
contracting member (venturi) 32 for contracting the flow<br>
passage provided inside the fuel nozzle 11 is arranged in the<br>
outer side wall 22 upstream of the fuel nozzle 11. An obstacle<br>
(a concentrator) 33 for once contracting and then expanding the<br>
flow passage is arranged outside of the oil gun 24 in the fuel<br>
nozzle central portion inside the fuel nozzle 11. The obstacle<br>
33 is arranged in the downstream side of the flow passage<br>
contracting member 32 in the solid fuel burner (the furnace 41<br>
side).<br>
The venturi 32 induces the velocity component in the<br>
direction toward the center axis of the fuel nozzle in the<br>
transporting gas and the fuel particles. By arranging the<br>
concentrator 33 in the downstream side of the venturi 32, a<br>
velocity component toward the outer side separation wall 22 of<br>
the fuel nozzle is induced in the fuel transporting gas and the<br>
fuel particles. Since the inertia force of the fuel particles<br>
is larger than that of the fuel transporting gas, the fuel<br>
particles can not follow the flow of the fuel transporting gas.<br>
Therefore, the fuel particles form a high density zone near the<br>
wall surface opposite to the flow passage change direction. By<br>
inducing the velocity component toward the outer side<br>
separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle by the venturi 32 and the<br>
concentrator 33, the fuel in the outer side flow passage 37 of<br>
the separator 34 flow along the outer side separation wall 22<br>
of the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
Since the air ejected from the additional air nozzle is<br>
ejected to the outer side flow passage 3 7 of the separator 35,<br>
the zone having the high fuel density and the high oxygen<br>
concentration is unevenly formed toward the inner side wall<br>
surface of the outer side separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle<br>
11. As the result, the combustion reaction of the fuel particles<br>
ejected from the fuel nozzle 11 is easily progressed by the high<br>
fuel density and the high oxygen concentration, and accordingly<br>
the flame 20 is stably formed at the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
At that time, the fuel jet flowing in the inner wall<br>
surface side of the outer side separation wall 22 of the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 is easily mixed with the air ejected from the outer<br>
side air nozzle at a position near the exit of the fuel nozzle<br>
11. Further, when the fuel jet is mixed with the high<br>
temperature gas of the circulation flow produced in the rear<br>
stream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23, temperature rise<br>
of the fuel particles is caused, and the fuel is apt to be<br>
ignited.<br>
The air is ejected from the additional air nozzle 12 in<br>
the direction nearly perpendicular to the direction of the fuel<br>
jet flowing inside the fuel nozzle 11, the separator 35 is<br>
arranged in the fuel nozzle 11, and an exit of the additional<br>
air nozzle is in a position where the exit overlaps with the<br>
separator when the exit is seen from a direction vertical to<br>
an axis of the burner, as described above. By doing so, the<br>
oxygen concentration at a position near the outer side<br>
separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11 becomes high. The<br>
mixing between the fuel particles and the air is progressed,<br>
and the flame 20 is stably formed at the exit of the fuel nozzle<br>
11. Therefore, combustion can be stably continued in a load<br>
lower than a conventional low load.<br>
In .FIG.1, the diameter of the upstream side end of the<br>
separator 35 is smaller than the diameter of the obstacle 33<br>
on the fuel nozzle 11. That is, the cross-sectional area of the<br>
flow passage of the outer side flow passage 37 in the upstream<br>
side end portion of the separator 35 among the fuel nozzle flow<br>
passage divided by the separator 35 is larger than the<br>
cross-sectional area of the flow passage contracted by the<br>
obstacle 33. By such a structure of the fuel nozzle described<br>
above, the upstream side end portion of the separator is hidden<br>
by the obstacle 33 when the fuel ejecting exit is seen from the<br>
upstream side of the fuel nozzle 11. Therefore, the fuel<br>
particles are easy to enter the outer side flow passage 37 of<br>
the separator 35 due to the inertia force.<br>
The fuel density in the outer side flow passage of the<br>
fuel nozzle 11 becomes high because an amount of the fuel<br>
particles colliding against the upstream side end portion of<br>
the separator 35 thereby to disturb the flow is decreased.<br>
In the case where blown coal or lignite is burned under<br>
a high thermal load, the amount of fuel burning at a position<br>
near the solid fuel burner is increased under a good mixing<br>
condition of air and the fuel because the fuel contains a large<br>
amount of volatile matters. Accordingly, the thermal load near<br>
the solid fuel burner is locally increased. At that time,<br>
temperature rise of the structure of the solid fuel burner and<br>
the wall of the furnace is increased by radiant heat from the<br>
flame 20.<br>
In a case of low melting temperature of the combustion<br>
ash, there is possibility to cause slugging by that combustion<br>
ash attaches and melts on the wall of the furnace etc. When the<br>
combustion ash attached on the wall of the furnace etc grows,<br>
there is possibility to cause blocking of the flow passage of<br>
the solid fuel burner or occurrence of instability in the heat<br>
absorption balance of the furnace wall. In the worst case,<br>
operation of the combustion apparatus may be stopped.<br>
Particularly, blown coal and lignite are apt to cause slugging<br>
because the melting temperature of the combustion ash of blown<br>
coal and lignite is low compared to that of bituminous coal.<br>
In the present embodiment 1, the trouble of slugging<br>
easily caused under the high load condition is solved by<br>
changing the position of forming the flame 20 according as the<br>
load of the solid fuel burner changes. That is, the flame 20<br>
is formed at a position distant from the solid fuel burner when<br>
the load condition is high, and the flame 20 is formed from a<br>
position near the exit of the fuel nozzle 11 when the load<br>
condition is low. Under the low load condition, even if the<br>
flame 20 is brought close to the wall of the furnace or the solid<br>
fuel burner, the temperature of the solid fuel burner and the<br>
wall of the furnace around the solid fuel burner is lower than<br>
that in the case of the high load condition because of the low<br>
thermal load in the furnace 41. Therefore, the slugging does<br>
not occur.<br>
In the present embodiment 1, when the load condition is<br>
low, the flame 20 is formed from a position near the exit of<br>
the fuel nozzle 11, and the high temperature gas is stagnated<br>
in the circulation flow 19 which is formed in the downstream<br>
side of the flame stabilizing ring 23 and the guide 25. Further,<br>
the oxygen concentration in the fuel jet 16 near the flame<br>
stabilizing ring 23 is increased by opening a flow control valve<br>
34 of the additional air nozzle 12 to supply air. As the result,<br>
since the combustion speed becomes higher compared to the<br>
condition of low oxygen concentration, ignition of the fuel<br>
particles can be advanced to form the flame 20 near the fuel<br>
nozzle 11.<br>
Under the high load condition, the flame 20 is formed at<br>
a position distant from the solid fuel burner to reduce the<br>
thermal load near the solid fuel burner. In the present<br>
embodiment 1, the amount of supplied air is reduced compared<br>
to the case of the low load condition by closing the flow control<br>
valve 34 of the additional air nozzle 12. At the time, the oxygen<br>
concentration in the fuel jet 16 at the position near the flame<br>
stabilizing ring 23 becomes lower than that in the low load<br>
condition to make the combustion speed slower. As the result,<br>
the temperature of the circulation flow produced in the<br>
downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23 is lowered to<br>
decrease the amount of radiant heat received by the structure<br>
of the solid fuel burner, and accordingly occurrence of<br>
slugging can be suppressed.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view showing a state in which flame 20 of the<br>
solid fuel burner is formed separated from the circulation flow<br>
19 in the downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23 when<br>
the embodiment 1 of the solid fuel burner is used under the high<br>
load condition.<br>
FIG. 4 is a horizontal cross-sectional view showing the<br>
structure of a combustion apparatus using the embodiment 1 of<br>
the solid fuel burners 42. When the solid fuel burners 42 are<br>
used under the high load condition as shown in FIG. 3, it is<br>
preferable that the flames 20 are mixed with one another inside<br>
the furnace 41 in order to reduce probability of occurrence of<br>
flameout.<br>
Although FIG. 4 shows a structure in which the solid fuel<br>
burners 42 are arranged in the four corners of the wall of the<br>
furnace, the same can be said in a case of an opposed combustion<br>
type in which the solid fuel burners 42 are arranged on the<br>
opposed walls of the combustion apparatus.<br>
In the present embodiment 1, description has been made<br>
on the remedy for occurrence of slugging when the melting point<br>
of combustion ash of the solid fuel is low. When the melting<br>
point of combustion ash of the solid fuel is high or when the<br>
problem of slugging does not occur due to a low load condition<br>
of the furnace, the flame of the solid fuel burner may be formed<br>
at the exit of the fuel nozzle, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In order to reduce nitrogen oxides NOx produced by<br>
combustion, it is preferable that the amount of air is<br>
controlled so that a ratio of the total amount of air supplied<br>
from the additional air nozzle and supplied from the additional<br>
air nozzle to the amount of air necessary for completely burning<br>
the volatile matters may becomes 0.85 to 0.95.<br>
Most of fuel is burned by mixed with air supplied from<br>
the above-described nozzles contained in the fuel nozzle 11<br>
(the first step), and then burned by being mixed with the<br>
secondary air flow 17 and the tertiary air flow 18 (the second<br>
step). Further, in a case where an after air port 49 (refer to<br>
FIG. 9) for supplying air into the combustion apparatus 41 is<br>
arranged in the downstream side of the solid fuel burner, the<br>
fuel is completely burned by being mixed with air supplied from<br>
the after air port 49 (the third step). The volatile matters<br>
in the fuel are burned in the first step described above because<br>
the combustion speed of the volatile matters is faster than that<br>
of the solid fuel.<br>
At that time, when the air ratio to the volatile matters<br>
is set to 0.85 to 0.95,combustion of the fuel can be accelerated<br>
to be burned by high flame temperature though the condition is<br>
lacking in oxygen. Since the fuel is reduction-burned under<br>
lacking of oxygen in the combustion in the first step, the<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced from nitrogen in the fuel and<br>
nitrogen in air are converted to harmless nitrogen, and<br>
accordingly, the amount of NOx exhausted from the furnace 41<br>
can be reduced. Since the fuel reacts under high temperature,<br>
the reaction of the second step is accelerated to reduce the<br>
amount of unburned components.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2 of the solid fuel burner seeing from<br>
the side of the furnace 41, the solid fuel burner of the present<br>
embodiment is cylindrical in which the cylindrical fuel nozzle<br>
11, the cylindrical secondary nozzle 13 and the cylindrical<br>
tertiary nozzle are concentrically arranged.<br>
FIG. 5 is a view showing another example of a nozzle part<br>
of the solid fuel burner. The fuel nozzle 11 may be rectangular,<br>
the concentrator 33 may be triangular, or the air nozzle<br>
structure that the fuel nozzle is put between at least part of<br>
the outer side air nozzles such as the secondary air nozzle 13,<br>
the tertiary air nozzle 14 etc may be acceptable. Further, the<br>
outer side air may be supplied from a single nozzle, or the<br>
nozzle structure divided into three or more parts may be<br>
acceptable.<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing a further other<br>
example of a solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In this example, an inner side air nozzle 38 is<br>
arranged in the solid fuel burner 11, and is connected to a wind<br>
box 26 using a pipe. Part of the air supplied to the solid fuel<br>
burner is ejected from the inner side air nozzle 38.<br>
When the air is mixed from the fuel nozzle, mixing of the<br>
fuel and the air is accelerated compared to the mixing using<br>
only the outer side air nozzles 13 and 14. Further, when a large<br>
amount of air is ejected from the inner side air nozzle 38, the<br>
flow speed of the fuel jet 16 flowing in the side portion is<br>
accelerated, and as the result, the ignition position of the<br>
fuel can be made distant from the solid fuel burner. Therefore,<br>
by decreasing the amount of air ejected from the additional air<br>
nozzle 12 and increasing the amount of air ejected from the<br>
inner side air nozzle 38, it is possible to cope with the case<br>
that the flame is formed at a position distant from the solid<br>
fuel burner under the high load condition.<br>
Further, the separator 35 of the solid fuel burner shown<br>
in FIG. 6 is tapered in the upstream side. By forming the<br>
separator in the tapered shape, the ratio of amounts of the fuel<br>
jet 16 flowing through the inner side flow passage 36 and the<br>
fuel jet flowing through the outer side flow passage 3 7 divided<br>
by the separator 35.<br>
In the case of the solid fuel burner shown in FIG. 6, the<br>
flow speed is decreased in the outer side flow passage 37 of<br>
the separator 35 because the cross-sectional area of the flow<br>
passage is widened by the tapered shape, and accordingly the<br>
additional air 21 ejected from the additional air nozzle 12 is<br>
easy to reach the separator 35. Further, since the flow speed<br>
of the flow 16 of the fuel and the transporting gas is decreased<br>
in the outer periphery of the exit of the fuel nozzle 11, the<br>
fuel particle become easily ignited in a position near the solid<br>
fuel burner. Therefore, the flame 20 can be easily formed from<br>
a portion close to the solid fuel burner.<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic view showing the structure of the<br>
solid fuel burner employing a flame stabilizing ring having<br>
another structure seeing from the inner side of a furnace. In<br>
the present embodiment, a toothed flame stabilizing ring 54<br>
having projected plate-shaped edges may be arranged in the exit<br>
of the fuel nozzle 11, as shown in FIG. 7. The fuel flows around<br>
to the back of the toothed flame stabilizing ring 54 to be easily<br>
ignited. That is, the fuel is ignited in the back side of the<br>
toothed flame stabilizing ring 54.<br>
EMBODIMENT 2<br>
FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view showing the structure<br>
of an embodiment 2 of a solid fuel burner without any<br>
concentrator in accordance with the present invention, and the<br>
view shows a state in which fuel ejected from the solid fuel<br>
burner under a low load condition is burning. In the embodiment<br>
1, the concentrator 33 is arranged in the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
However, even without the concentrator 33 as the present<br>
embodiment 2, when air is ejected from the additional air nozzle<br>
in the direction nearly perpendicular to the direction of the<br>
fuel jet flowing inside the fuel nozzle 11, the speed difference<br>
between the fuel particles and the air becomes larger than in<br>
the case of ejecting the additional air in parallel to the<br>
direction of the fuel jet, and the fuel jet and the air are mixed<br>
with each other similarly to the case of the embodiment 1.<br>
Further, the additional air nozzle 12 and the separator<br>
35 are arranged at the position overlapping in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the ejecting direction of the mixed fluid<br>
ejected from the fuel nozzle 11. Therefore, the additional air<br>
jet 21 is blocked to flow toward the ejected direction by the<br>
separator 35, and accordingly does not expand into the inner<br>
side flow passage 36 of the separator 34 but flows through the<br>
outer side flow passage 37.<br>
The flow resistance of the outer side flow passage 37 of<br>
the separator 35 is larger than that of the inner side flow<br>
passage 36 because the additional air jet 21 is mixed with the<br>
mixed fluid. When the amount of the additional air is increased,<br>
the amount of the transporting gas flowing the outer side flow<br>
passage 37 is decreased. On the other hand, the fuel particles<br>
flow into the outer side flow passage 37 regardless of the flow<br>
resistance because the inertia force of the fuel particles is<br>
larger than that of gas. Therefore, the amount of the fuel<br>
particles is almost unchanged.<br>
Therefore, when the amount of the additional air is<br>
increased, the amount of the transporting gas entering into the<br>
outer side flow passage 37 together with the fuel particles in<br>
decreased, and the transporting gas is replaced by the<br>
additional air. Compared to the case where the additional air<br>
flows in parallel to the flow direction of the transporting gas,<br>
dilution of the oxygen concentration is smaller, and<br>
accordingly the oxygen concentration becomes higher. Further,<br>
the separator 35 can prevent the fuel particles from being<br>
dispersed by disturbance produced at mixing of the additional<br>
air and the transporting gas. As the result, the oxygen<br>
concentration is high in the outer side flow passage 37 of the<br>
separator 35, and the fuel density to the transporting gas is<br>
also higher in the outer side flow passage 3 7 because most of<br>
the transporting gas flows through the inner side flow passage<br>
36.<br>
EMBODIMENT 3<br>
FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view showing the structure<br>
of an embodiment 3 of a solid fuel burner in accordance with<br>
the present invention, and the view shows a state in which fuel<br>
ejected from the solid fuel burner under a low load condition<br>
is burning. Main different points of the present embodiment 3<br>
from the embodiment 1 are that the fuel nozzle 11 is rectangular<br>
and that the air nozzle 13 is arranged beside the fuel nozzle<br>
11.<br>
The inside of the fuel nozzle 11 is constructed of an<br>
obstacle (concentrator) 33 and a separator 35 arranged in this<br>
order from the upstream side, and the obstacle 33 is set at a<br>
position on a separation wall opposite to the air nozzle 13 of<br>
the fuel nozzle 11. The additional air nozzle 12 is set in a<br>
direction that the air ejected toward the outer side separation<br>
wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11 becomes nearly perpendicular to<br>
the flow direction of the mixed fluid flowing through the fuel<br>
nozzle 11. At that time, the exit of the additional air nozzle<br>
12 is in a position overlapping with the separator 35 with<br>
respect to the axis of the burner.<br>
An obstacle called as a flame stabilizing ring 23 is<br>
arranged in the front end portion, that is, the furnace exit<br>
side of the separation wall 22 separating between the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 and the air nozzle 13. The flame stabilizing ring 23<br>
serves as a obstacle to the fuel jet 16 composed of the fuel<br>
and the transporting gas ejected from the fuel nozzle 11 and<br>
to the flow 17 of the air flowing through the air nozzle 13.<br>
Therefore, pressure in the downstream side (the furnace 41<br>
side) of the flame stabilizing ring 23 is decreased, and a flow<br>
to a direction opposite to the fuel jet 16 and the flow 17 of<br>
air is induced in this portion. This opposite direction flow<br>
is called as the circulation flow 19.<br>
The flame 20 is apt to be formed from the downstream of<br>
the separation wall 22 separating the fuel nozzle 11 and the<br>
air nozzle 12 where the air ejected from the air nozzle 13 and<br>
the fuel particles are easily mixed. By arranging the flame<br>
stabilizing ring 23 downstream of this separation wall 22, high<br>
temperature combustion gas from the inside of the furnace 41<br>
stagnates in the circulation flow 19. The high temperature gas<br>
and the fuel in the fuel jet 16 are mixed at the exit of the<br>
solid fuel burner, and the temperature of the fuel particles<br>
is further increased by the radiant heat from the furnace 41<br>
to ignite the fuel particles.<br>
In the air nozzle 13 side of the flame stabilizing ring<br>
23, a guide 25 is formed so that the air flow 17 may be ejected<br>
toward a direction having an angle with respect to the direction<br>
of the fuel jet 16. The direction of the air jet is guided toward<br>
the direction departing from the center axis of the burner by<br>
arranging the guide 25. Therefore, it is useful to form the<br>
circulation flow 19 by decreasing the pressure in the<br>
downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23.<br>
The present embodiment 3 has the additional air nozzle<br>
12 for ejecting air in the fuel nozzle 11 toward the direction<br>
nearly perpendicular to the direction of the fuel jet. When the<br>
additional air jet 21 ejected from the additional air nozzle<br>
12 is ejected nearly perpendicular to the direction of the fuel<br>
jet, the speed difference between the fuel particles and the<br>
air becomes larger than the speed difference when the<br>
additional air jet 21 is ejected in parallel to the direction<br>
of the fuel jet to accelerate the mixing. Particularly, since<br>
the density of the fuel particles is larger than that of gas,<br>
the fuel particles are mixed into the additional air jet.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment 3, the exit of the<br>
additional air nozzle 12 is in the position overlapping with<br>
the separator 35 with respect to the axis of the burner. The<br>
ejected direction of the additional air jet 21 is blocked by<br>
the separator 35 to flow through the flow passage 37 in the air<br>
nozzle side of the separator 35.<br>
The flow passage 37 in the air nozzle side of the<br>
separator 35 has a flow resistance larger than that of the flow<br>
passage 36 in the opposite side because the additional air jet<br>
21 is mixed. When the amount of the additional air is increased,<br>
the amount of the transporting gas flowing through the flow<br>
passage 3 7 in the air nozzle side is decreased. On the other<br>
hand, the fuel particles flow into the outer side flow passage<br>
37 regardless of the flow resistance because the inertia force<br>
of the fuel particles is larger than that of gas. Therefore,<br>
the amount of the fuel particles is almost unchanged.<br>
Therefore, when the amount of the additional air is<br>
increased, the amount of the transporting gas entering into the<br>
flow passage 37 in the air nozzle side together with the fuel<br>
particles in decreased. Since the transporting gas is replaced<br>
by the additional air, dilution of the oxygen concentration is<br>
smaller compared to the case where the transporting gas and the<br>
additional air are simply mixed, and accordingly the oxygen<br>
concentration becomes higher. Further, the separator 35 can<br>
prevent the fuel particles from being dispersed by disturbance<br>
produced at mixing of the additional air and the transporting<br>
gas. As the result, the oxygen concentration becomes high in<br>
the flow passage 37 in the air nozzle side.<br>
Further, a velocity component toward the outer side<br>
separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle is induced in the fuel<br>
transporting gas and the fuel particles by the obstacle (the<br>
concentrator) 33. The fuel particles flow along the flow<br>
passage 37 in the air nozzle side of the separator 35 because<br>
of the large inertia force to increase the fuel density in this<br>
zone.<br>
EMBODIMENT 4<br>
FIG. 10 is a schematic view showing the structure of a<br>
combustion apparatus using the solid fuel burner in accordance<br>
with the present invention, and FIG. 11 is a horizontal<br>
cross-sectional view of the furnace of FIG. 10.<br>
In the present embodiment 4, the solid fuel burners 42<br>
are arranged in two stages in the vertical direction of the<br>
combustion apparatus (furnace) 41 and in the four corners of<br>
the combustion apparatus 41 in the horizontal direction, the<br>
solid fuel burners 42 being directed toward the center. The fuel<br>
is supplied from a fuel hopper 43 to a pulverizer 45 through<br>
a coal feeder 44. At that time, the fuel is mixed with the<br>
combustion exhaust gas extracted from an upper portion of the<br>
combustion apparatus 41 in a combustion exhaust gas pipe 55 in<br>
the downstream side of the coal feeder 44, and then introduced<br>
into the pulverizer 45.<br>
As the fuel is mixed with the high temperature combustion<br>
exhaust gas, the water component contained in the fuel is<br>
evaporated. Further, since the oxygen concentration is reduced,<br>
self-ignition and explosion of the mixture of the fuel and the<br>
gas can be suppressed even if the temperature of the mixture<br>
becomes high when the fuel is pulverized by the pluverizer 45.<br>
In the case of blown coal, the oxygen concentration is 6 to 15 %<br>
in most cases. Air is supplied from a blower 4 6 to the solid<br>
fuel burners 42 and an after air port 4 9 arranged in the<br>
downstream side of the solid fuel burners 42.<br>
The present embodiment 4 employs the two-stage<br>
combustion method that an amount of air less than the amount<br>
of air necessary for complete combustion of the fuel is input<br>
to the solid fuel burners 42, and then the remaining air is<br>
supplied from the after air port 49.<br>
The present invention can be also applied to the single<br>
combustion method that an amount of air necessary for complete<br>
combustion of the fuel is input to the solid fuel burners 42<br>
without providing any after air port 49.<br>
The present embodiment 4 does not comprise any temporary<br>
fuel storage portion between the pulverizer 45 and the solid<br>
fuel burner 42.<br>
EMBODIMENT 5<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic view showing the structure of<br>
another example of a combustion apparatus using the solid fuel<br>
burner in accordance with the present invention. The present<br>
invention can be also applied to the fuel supply method that<br>
a fuel hopper 57 is arranged between the pulverizer 45 and the<br>
solid fuel burner 57, and different gases are used for the<br>
transporting gas flowing through a pipe 55 from the pulverizer<br>
4 5 to the fuel hopper 57 and for the transporting gas flowing<br>
in the pipe 56 from the hopper 57 to the solid fuel burner 42.<br>
In the fuel supply method shown in FIG. 12, the<br>
transporting gas having a thermal capacity grown by evaporation<br>
of moisture contained in the fuel particles inside the pipe 55<br>
is separated by the fuel hopper portion, and then is input into<br>
the furnace 41 through the downstream side of the solid fuel<br>
burner 42 of the furnace 41.<br>
Since the water contained in the transporting gas<br>
supplied to the solid fuel burner 42 is reduced by separating<br>
the transporting gas as described above, the flame temperature<br>
of the flame 20 formed by the solid fuel burner 42 is increased<br>
to reduce amounts of the nitrogen oxides and the unburned<br>
components or unburned carbons.<br>
When the solid fuel is burned with high combustion load,<br>
there are some cases in which combustion ash attaches on to the<br>
structures of the solid fuel burner and the wall of the furnace<br>
to cause a phenomenon called as slugging in which the attached<br>
substance is growing. In a case where there is high possibility<br>
of occurrence of slugging, the slugging can be suppressed by<br>
changing the combustion method of the solid fuel burner<br>
corresponding to the combustion load.<br>
That is, under the high load condition, the flame 20 is<br>
formed at a position distant from the solid fuel burner 42 to<br>
reduce the thermal load near the solid fuel burner 42. On the<br>
other hand, under the low load condition, the flame 2 0 is formed<br>
from a position near the exit of the fuel nozzle 11. In such<br>
a combustion method, it is necessary to monitor the flame 20<br>
in order to safely operate the combustion apparatus.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that the<br>
monitoring method is also changed because the combustion method<br>
is changed corresponding to the load. That is, under the low<br>
load condition, in order to monitor the flame 20 formed in each<br>
of the solid fuel burners 42, load flame detectors 4 7 are<br>
individually arranged in the solid fuel burners 42. On the other<br>
hand, under the high load condition, a load flame detector 48<br>
for monitoring the central portion of the combustion apparatus<br>
needs to be installed because the flame 20 is formed at<br>
positions distant from the solid fuel burner 42. The flames are<br>
monitored by selecting signals of the flame detectors 47 and<br>
4 8 corresponding to the load and the combustion method.<br>
Further, in order to reduce an amount of slug attached<br>
to the structures of the solid fuel burners and the wall of the<br>
furnace 41 under the high load condition, it is possible that<br>
thermometers or radiation pyrometers are arranged on the wall<br>
of the furnace 41 and in the solid fuel burners 42, and the flow<br>
rate of the additional air is controlled based on the signals<br>
of the thermometers or the radiation pyrometers.<br>
EMBODIMENT 6<br>
FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view showing the structure<br>
of an embodiment 6 of the solid fuel burner in accordance with<br>
the present invention, FIG. 14 is a schematic view showing the<br>
structure of the solid fuel burner seeing from the inner side<br>
the combustion apparatus 41.<br>
The solid fuel burner of the present embodiment 6<br>
comprises a combustion improving oil gun 24 in the central<br>
portion, and a fuel nozzle 11 for ejecting the mixed fluid of<br>
the fuel and the transporting gas of the fuel around the<br>
combustion improving gun 24. A plurality of additional air<br>
nozzles 12 are arranged in the directions that the nozzle exits<br>
are directed from an outer side separation wall 22 of the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 toward the center axis of the solid fuel burner.<br>
The combustion improving gun 24 arranged so as to<br>
penetrate the central portion of the fuel nozzle is used for<br>
igniting the fuel at starting the solid fuel burner.<br>
Outside the fuel nozzle 11, there are the annular outer<br>
side air nozzles (a secondary air nozzle 13, a tertiary air<br>
nozzle 14) for ejecting air, and the annular outer side air<br>
nozzles are concentric to the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
An obstacle called as a flame stabilizing ring 24 is<br>
arranged in the front end portion of the fuel nozzle, that is,<br>
in the exit side to the combustion apparatus. The flame<br>
stabilizing ring 23 serves as an obstacle to the fuel jet 16<br>
composed of the fuel and the transporting gas ejected from the<br>
fuel nozzle 11 and the secondary air flow 17 flowing through<br>
the secondary air nozzle 13. Therefore, the pressure in the<br>
downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23, that is, in<br>
the combustion apparatus 41 side is decreased, and flow toward<br>
the direction opposite to the direction of the fuel jet 16 and<br>
the secondary air flow is induced. The opposite direction flow<br>
is defined as a circulation flow 19.<br>
High temperature gas produced by combustion of fuel flows<br>
into the inside of the circulation flow 19 from the downstream<br>
side, and is stagnated in the circulation flow 19. As the high<br>
temperature gas and the fuel in the fuel jet 16 are mixed inside<br>
the combustion apparatus at the exit of the solid fuel burner,<br>
the temperature of the fuel particles are increased by the<br>
radiant heat from the inside of the combustion apparatus 41 to<br>
be ignited.<br>
The secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary<br>
air nozzle 14 are separated from each other by a separating wall<br>
29, and the front end portion of the separating wall 29 is formed<br>
in a guide 25 for ejecting the flow of the tertiary air 18 so<br>
as to have an angle to the fuel jet 16. If a guide 25 for guiding<br>
the ejecting direction of the outer side air toward the<br>
direction departing from the center axis of the burner is<br>
arranged at the exit of the flow passages of the outer air<br>
nozzles (the secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary air nozzle<br>
14), the guide is useful for easily forming the circulation flow<br>
19, together with the flame stabilizing ring 23.<br>
In order to add swirling force to the air ejected from<br>
the secondary air nozzle 13 and the tertiary air nozzle 14,<br>
swirlers 27 and 28 are arranged in the nozzles 13 and 14.<br>
A burner throat 30 composing the wall of the combustion<br>
apparatus also serves as an outer peripheral wall of the<br>
tertiary air nozzle. Water pipes 31 are arranged in the wall, <br><br>
of the combustion apparatus. <br><br>
In the present embodiment 6,the oxygen concentration in<br>
the fuel jet 16 flowing through the fuel nozzle 11 is lowered <br>
using the combustion exhaust gas for the transporting gas of<br>
the fuel. As an example to which such a combustion method is<br>
applied, there is combustion of blown coal or lignite.<br>
Blown coal and lignite are low in calorific value<br>
compared to coal of a high coalification rank such as bituminous<br>
coal and anthracite, and are generally low in grindability or<br>
pulverizability. Furthermore, combustion ash of these solid<br>
fuels is low in melting temperature. Since these solid fuels<br>
contain much volatile matters, these solid fuels easily<br>
self-ignite in a storage process and a pulverizing process<br>
under air atmosphere, and accordingly are difficult to be<br>
handled compared to bituminous coal. In a case where blown coal<br>
or lignite is pulverized to be burned, a mixed gas of combustion<br>
exhaust gas and air is used as a transporting gas of the fuel<br>
in order to prevent these fuels from self-igniting. The<br>
combustion exhaust gas reduces the oxygen concentration to<br>
prevent the fuel from self-burning. On the other hand, the<br>
retention heat of the combustion exhaust gas evaporates the<br>
moisture in the fuel.<br>
Under a low oxygen concentration atmosphere, combustion<br>
speed is slower compared to combustion speed under air<br>
atmosphere. When pulverized coal such as blown coal or lignite<br>
is transported using the transporting gas of a low oxygen<br>
concentration, the combustion speed is limited by the mixing<br>
speed of the fuel and air, and the combustion speed is decreased<br>
lower compared to bituminous coal which can be transported by<br>
air. Therefore, when blown coal or lignite is burned by a solid<br>
fuel burner under a low load condition in which the burned<br>
amount of fuel is small, blow-off of the flame 20 or flameout<br>
is apt to occur compared to the case of bituminous coal.<br>
The present embodiment 6 comprises the additional air<br>
nozzles 12 for ejecting air toward the direction nearly<br>
perpendicular to the flow direction of the fuel jet inside the<br>
fuel nozzle. When the air jet (the additional air jet) 21<br>
ejected from the additional air nozzle 12 is ejected toward the<br>
direction nearly perpendicular to the flow direction of the<br>
fuel jet, the mixing between the fuel jet and the additional<br>
air is progressed because the speed difference between the fuel<br>
particles and the additional air jet is larger than the speed<br>
difference in the case where the additional air jet ejected from<br>
the additional air nozzle is ejected in parallel to the<br>
direction of the fuel jet. Particularly, since the specific<br>
density of the fuel particle is larger than that of air, the<br>
fuel particles are mixed into the additional air jet by an<br>
inertia force.<br>
At that time, since the transporting gas (low oxygen<br>
concentration) around the fuel particles is separated from the<br>
fuel particles, the oxygen concentration around the fuel<br>
particles becomes higher than the oxygen concentration of the<br>
transporting gas. Therefore, after ejected from the fuel nozzle,<br>
the combustion reaction is accelerated by the high oxygen<br>
concentration, and accordingly flame 20 is stably formed at the<br>
exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
In order to prevent back fire or burnout by forming flame<br>
20 inside the fuel nozzle 11, it is preferable that the distance<br>
from the exit of the fuel nozzle to the exit of the additional<br>
air nozzle 12 is a length capable of making the fuel retention<br>
time in the fuel nozzle shorter than the ignition lag time of<br>
the fuel (approximately 0.1 second). Since the fuel<br>
transporting gas generally flows inside the fuel nozzle at a<br>
flow speed of 12 to 20 m/s, the distance from the exit of the<br>
fuel nozzle to the exit of the additional air nozzle is shorter<br>
than lm.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment 6, a flow passage<br>
contracting member 32 for contracting the flow passage provided<br>
inside the fuel nozzle 11 is arranged in the outer side wall<br>
22 upstream of the fuel nozzle 11. An obstacle (a concentrator)<br>
33 for once contracting and then expanding the flow passage is<br>
arranged outside of the oil gun 24 in the fuel nozzle central<br>
portion inside the fuel nozzle 11. The obstacle 33 is arranged<br>
in the downstream side of the flow passage contracting member<br>
32 in the solid fuel burner (the combustion apparatus 41 side).<br>
The flow passage contracting member 32 induces the<br>
velocity component in the direction toward the center axis of<br>
the fuel nozzle in the fuel particles (the pulverized coal) of<br>
which the inertia force is larger than that of the fuel<br>
transporting gas. By arranging the concentrator 33 in the<br>
downstream side of the flow passage contracting member 32, the<br>
flow of the fuel particles (the pulverized coal) contracted<br>
toward the burner center axis direction by the flow passage<br>
contracting member 32 flows along the flow passage of the fuel<br>
nozzle toward the separation wall 22 after passed through the<br>
concentrator 33. The fuel particles (the pulverized coal)<br>
flowing along the flow passage inside the fuel nozzle unevenly<br>
flow in the side of the inner wall surface (in the side of the<br>
separating wall 22) toward the exit. Therefore, the fuel is<br>
enriched in the side of the inner wall surface of the fuel nozzle<br>
11 (in the side of the separating wall 22).<br>
Since the air ejected from the additional air nozzle is<br>
also ejected in the vicinity of the outer periphery (the<br>
separating wall 22) side in the fuel nozzle 11,a region of high<br>
fuel concentration and high oxygen concentration is formed. As<br>
the result, after the fuel is ejected from the fuel nozzle, the<br>
combustion reaction is accelerated by the high oxygen<br>
concentration to stably form flame 20 at the exit of the fuel<br>
nozzle. The fuel jet flowing in the vicinity of the outer<br>
periphery (separating wall 22) of the fuel nozzle 11 is easily<br>
mixed with the air ejected from the outer side air nozzle near<br>
the exit of the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
Further, when the fuel jet is mixed with the high<br>
temperature gas of the circulation flow produced in the rear<br>
stream side of the flame stabilizing ring 23, temperature rise<br>
of the fuel particles is caused, and the fuel is apt to be<br>
ignited. As the result, the flame 20 is stably formed at the<br>
exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
By ejecting the air from the additional air nozzle 12 in<br>
the direction nearly perpendicular to the direction of the fuel<br>
jet flowing inside the fuel nozzle 11, as described above, the<br>
mixing between the fuel particles and the air is progressed,<br>
and the flame 20 is stably formed at the exit of the fuel nozzle.<br>
Therefore, combustion can be stably continued in a load lower<br>
than a conventional low load.<br>
In the case where blown coal or lignite is burned with<br>
high thermal load, the amount of fuel burning at a position near<br>
the solid fuel burner is increased under a good mixing condition<br>
of air and the fuel because the fuel contains a large amount<br>
of volatile matters. When the thermal load near the solid fuel<br>
burner is locally increased to cause temperature rise of the<br>
structure of the solid fuel burner and the wall of the<br>
combustion apparatus by radiant heat from the flame 20, as<br>
described above, there is possibility to cause slugging by that<br>
combustion ash attaches and melts on the wall of the combustion<br>
apparatus. Particularly, blown coal and lignite are apt to<br>
cause slugging because of low melting temperature of the<br>
combustion ash.<br>
In the present embodiment 6, the position of forming the<br>
flame 20 is changed corresponding to the load of the solid fuel<br>
burner to solve the trouble caused by the difference of the<br>
combustion state between under the high load condition and<br>
under the low load condition of the solid fuel burner when the<br>
fuel of a low coalification rank is used. That is, the flame<br>
20 is formed at a position distant from the solid fuel burner<br>
when the load condition is high, and the flame 20 is formed from<br>
a position near the exit of the fuel nozzle 11 when the load<br>
condition is low. Under the low load condition, even if the<br>
flame 20 is brought close to the wall of the combustion<br>
apparatus or the solid fuel burner, the temperature of the solid<br>
fuel burner and the wall of the combustion apparatus around the<br>
solid fuel burner is lower than that in the case of the high<br>
load condition because of the low thermal load in the combustion<br>
apparatus 41. Therefore, the slugging does not occur.<br>
In the present embodiment 6, when the load condition is<br>
low, the flame 20 is formed from a position near the exit of<br>
the fuel nozzle 11, and the high temperature gas is stagnated<br>
in the circulation flow 19 which is formed in the downstream<br>
side of the flame stabilizing ring 23 and the guide 25. Further,<br>
the oxygen concentration in the fuel jet 16 near the flame<br>
stabilizing ring 23 is increased by opening a flow control valve<br>
34 of the additional air nozzle 12 to supply air. As the result,<br>
since the combustion speed becomes higher compared to the<br>
condition of low oxygen concentration, ignition of the fuel<br>
particles can be advanced to form the flame 20 near the fuel<br>
nozzle 11.<br>
Under the high load condition, the flame 20 is formed at<br>
a position distant from the solid fuel burner to reduce the<br>
thermal load near the solid fuel burner. Therefore, in the<br>
present embodiment 6, the amount of supplied air is reduced<br>
compared to the case of the low load condition by closing the<br>
flow control valve 34 of the additional air nozzle 12. At the<br>
time, the oxygen concentration in the fuel jet 16 at the<br>
position near the flame stabilizing ring 23 becomes lower than<br>
that in the low load condition to make the combustion speed<br>
slower. Therefore, the temperature of the circulation flow<br>
produced in the downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring<br>
23 is lowered to decrease the amount of radiant heat received<br>
by the structure of the solid fuel burner, and accordingly<br>
occurrence of slugging can be suppressed.<br>
FIG. 15 is a view showing a state in which flame 20 of<br>
the solid fuel burner is formed separated from the circulation<br>
flow 19 in the downstream side of the flame stabilizing ring<br>
23 when the embodiment 6 of the solid fuel burner is used under<br>
the high load condition.<br>
A horizontal cross-section of a combustion apparatus<br>
using the embodiment 6 of the solid fuel burners 42 is the same<br>
as FIG. 4. When the solid fuel burners 42 are used under the<br>
high load condition as shown in FIG. 15, it is preferable that<br>
the flames 20 are mixed with one another inside the combustion<br>
apparatus 41 in order to reduce probability of occurrence of<br>
flameout.<br>
In order to reduce nitrogen oxides NOx produced by<br>
combustion, it is preferable that the amount of air is<br>
controlled so that a ratio of the total amount of air supplied<br>
from the additional air nozzle and supplied from the additional<br>
air nozzle to the amount of air necessary for completely burning<br>
the volatile matters may becomes 0.85 to 0.95.<br>
Most of fuel is burned by mixed with air supplied from<br>
the above-described nozzles contained in the fuel nozzle 11<br>
(the first step), and then burned by being mixed with the<br>
secondary air flow 17 and the tertiary air flow 18 (the second<br>
step) . Further, in a case where an after air port 49 (refer to<br>
FIG. 10) for supplying air into the combustion apparatus 41 is<br>
arranged in the downstream side of the solid fuel burner, the<br>
fuel is completely burned by being mixed with air supplied from<br>
the after air port 49 (the third step). The volatile matters<br>
in the fuel are burned in the first step described above because<br>
the combustion speed of the volatile matters is faster than that<br>
of the solid fuel.<br>
At that time, when the air ratio to the volatile matters<br>
is set to 0.85 to 0.95, combustion of the fuel can be accelerated<br>
to be burned by high flame temperature though the condition is<br>
lacking in oxygen. Since the fuel is reduction-burned under<br>
lacking of oxygen in the combustion in the first step, the<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced from nitrogen in the fuel and<br>
nitrogen in air are converted to harmless nitrogen, and<br>
accordingly, the amount of NOx exhausted from the combustion<br>
apparatus 41 can be reduced. Since the fuel reacts under high<br>
temperature, the reaction of the second step is accelerated to<br>
reduce the amount of unburned components.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14 of the solid fuel burner seeing from<br>
the side of the combustion apparatus, the solid fuel burner of<br>
the present embodiment 6 is cylindrical in which the<br>
cylindrical fuel nozzle 11, the cylindrical secondary nozzle<br>
13 and the cylindrical tertiary nozzle are concentrically<br>
arranged.<br>
FIG. 16 is a view showing another example of a nozzle part<br>
of the solid fuel burner. The fuel nozzle 11 may be rectangular,<br>
the concentrator 33 may be triangular, or the air nozzle<br>
structure that the fuel nozzle is put between at least part of<br>
the outer side air nozzles such as the secondary air nozzle 13,<br>
the tertiary air nozzle 14 etc may be acceptable. Further, the<br>
outer side air may be supplied from a single nozzle, or the<br>
nozzle structure of divided into three or more parts may be<br>
acceptable.<br>
EMBODIMENT 7<br>
FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view showing an embodiment<br>
2 of a solid fuel burner in accordance with the present<br>
invention in which the installation position of the additional<br>
air nozzle is changed. As shown in FIG. 17, the additional air<br>
nozzle 12 may eject air from the separation wall in the<br>
periphery of the fuel nozzle toward the center instead of<br>
ejecting air from the inside of the fuel nozzle toward the outer<br>
side as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
It is preferable that the additional air nozzle 12 is<br>
arranged in the portion where the flow passage of the fuel<br>
nozzle 11 expands. By arranging the exits of the additional air<br>
nozzle 12 in the flow passage expanding portion where a velocity<br>
component flowing from the flow passage toward the wall surface<br>
is hardly induced, it is possible to suppress the fuel particles<br>
from entering into or accumulated in the additional air nozzle.<br>
In order to prevent occurrence of burnout and backfire<br>
phenomena of the fuel nozzle 11 caused by igniting the fuel<br>
inside the fuel nozzle 11, it is preferable to determine<br>
arrangement of the additional air nozzle 12 so that the<br>
retention time of fuel in the fuel nozzle 11 may be shorter than<br>
the lag time of ignition. In general, the index of the ignition<br>
time lag of gas fuel is approximately 0.1 second which is<br>
shorter than the ignition time lag of pulverized coal, and the<br>
index of flow speed inside the fuel nozzle 11. For example, the<br>
distance between the exit of the fuel nozzle 11 and the exit<br>
of the additional air nozzle 12 is set to a value smaller than<br>
about 1 m.<br>
EMBODIMENT 8,<br>
FIG. 18 is a cross-sectional view showing the structure<br>
of an embodiment 8 of a solid fuel burner which does not have<br>
a concentrator 33. In the embodiment 6, the concentrator 33 is<br>
arranged in the fuel nozzle 11. However, as shown in FIG. 18,<br>
when air is ejected from the additional air nozzle in the<br>
direction nearly perpendicular to the direction of the fuel jet<br>
flowing inside the fuel nozzle 11, the fuel jet and the air are<br>
mixed with each other similarly to the case of the embodiment<br>
1 even without the concentrator 33.<br>
EMBODIMENT 9<br>
FIG. 19 and FIG. 20 each are a cross-sectional view<br>
showing the structure of an embodiment 9 of a solid fuel burner<br>
in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 19 shows a state<br>
in which fuel ejected from the solid fuel burner under a low<br>
load condition is burning in the combustion apparatus 41, and<br>
FIG. 20 shows a state in which fuel ejected from the solid fuel<br>
burner under a high load condition is burning in the combustion<br>
apparatus 41.<br>
A main difference between the present embodiment 9 and<br>
the embodiment 6 is that the flame stabilizing ring 23 and the<br>
guide 25 are not arranged in the front end portion of the outer<br>
side separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11. In the present<br>
embodiment 9, a swirler 27 arranged in the secondary air flow<br>
passage is used in order to vary the shape of the flame 2 0<br>
without the flame stabilizing ring 23 and the guide 25.<br>
Under the low load condition, the oxygen concentration<br>
in the fuel jet 16 is increased near the outer side separation<br>
wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11 by supplying air from the<br>
additional air nozzle 12. Since the combustion speed is<br>
increased compared to the case of the low oxygen concentration,<br>
ignition of the fuel particles is advanced to form the flame<br>
20 from a position near the fuel nozzle 11.<br>
In the present embodiment 9, a strong swirling velocity<br>
(generally, 1 or more in swirl number) is added to the secondary<br>
air using a swirler 2 7 arranged in the secondary flow passage.<br>
After ejected from the secondary air nozzle 13, the flow of the<br>
secondary air 17 is expanded toward the direction departing<br>
from the fuel jet 16 by the centrifugal force by the swirling<br>
velocity. At that time, pressure in the zone between the fuel<br>
jet 16 and the secondary air flow 17 is decreased to induce the<br>
circulation flow which flows toward the direction opposite to<br>
the flow direction of the fuel jet 16 and the secondary air flow<br>
17. When the flow rate of the secondary air flow is reduced to<br>
nearly zero by attaching a damper for decreasing the flow rate<br>
in the secondary air flow passage, a circulation flow can be<br>
induced between the secondary air flow 18 and the fuel jet 16.<br>
In the high load condition, the flame 20 is formed in a<br>
position distant from the solid fuel burner to reduce the<br>
thermal load around the solid fuel burner. Therefore, the<br>
amount of supplied air from the additional air nozzle 12 is<br>
reduced. As the supplied amount of the additional air is reduced,<br>
the oxygen concentration in the fuel jet 16 near the outer side<br>
separation wall 22 of the fuel nozzle 11 is lowered compared<br>
to the low load condition to make the combustion speed slower.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment 9, the swirl velocity<br>
added to the secondary air is weakened using the swirler 27<br>
arranged in the secondary air flow passage. Since the flow of<br>
the secondary air 17 flows in parallel to the fuel jet 16 after<br>
ejected from the secondary air nozzle 13, the circulation flow<br>
19 of opposite direction flow is not produced in the zone<br>
between the fuel jet 16 and the secondary air flow 17. By opening<br>
the damper attached to the secondary flow passage to increase<br>
the flow rate of the secondary air, it is possible to prevent<br>
occurrence of the circulation flow 19 of opposite; direction<br>
flow in the zone between the fuel jet 16 and the secondary air<br>
flow 17.<br>
FIG. 21. is a view showing an example of another structure<br>
of the flame stabilizing ring. In the present embodiment 9, a<br>
toothed flame stabilizing ring 54 may be arranged, as shown in<br>
FIG. 21. The fuel flows around to the back of the toothed flame<br>
stabilizing ring 54 to be easily ignited. That is, the fuel is<br>
ignited in the back side of the toothed flame stabilizing ring<br>
54.<br>
The structure of a combustion apparatus using the solid<br>
fuel burner shown in the embodiments 6 to 9 is the same as in<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
provide a solid fuel burner which comprises a means for<br>
accelerating mixing between the fuel particles and air inside<br>
the fuel nozzle to stably burn the fuel and to prevent<br>
occurrence of slugging caused by combustion ash over a wide<br>
range from a high load condition to a low load condition without<br>
changing a distance from the exit of the additional air nozzle<br>
to the exit of the fuel nozzle even using a solid fuel having<br>
comparatively low combustibility, that is, coal of a low<br>
coalification grade such as brown coal, lignite or the like.<br>
Further, it is possible to provide the combustion method<br>
using the solid fuel burner comprising the means for<br>
accelerating mixing between the fuel particles and air to<br>
stably burn the fuel and for preventing occurrence of slugging<br>
caused by combustion ash, and to provide the combustion<br>
apparatus comprising the solid fuel burner, the method of<br>
operating the combustion apparatus comprising the solid fuel<br>
burner, and the coal-fired boiler comprising the solid fuel<br>
burner.<br>
