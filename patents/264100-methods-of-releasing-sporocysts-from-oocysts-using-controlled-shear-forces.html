				<td>METHODS OF RELEASING SPOROCYSTS FROM OOCYSTS USING CONTROLLED SHEAR FORCES<br>
RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/900,233, filed February 8. 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to oocysts and, more particularly, to methods of releasing sporocysts from oocysts.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Coccidiosis of poultry is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimen'a. Oocysts of Eimeria species are ubiquitous in the environment and persist for many months in poultry litter. Ingestion of oocysts leads to infection of the various regions of the intestinal tract In a species-specific manner. The organism proliferates in the intestine over a period cf several days., resulting in the excretion of the next generation of oocysts in the feces. Multiple cycles of infection lead to immunity, and when the infection is presented to a flock early and in a uniform dosage among the flock, the immunity developed over several cycles of exposure can be quite robust.<br>
In contrast, when birds are not presented with the infection in a uniform manner, situations may arise in which naive birds are subject to sudden, massive infection, leading to poor performance in terms of feed conversion and weight gain, and a high risk of secondary infections Currently the most common method used for control of coccidiosis in the poultry industry is not vaccination,<br>
but rather the administration of anticoccidial drugs in the feed. The low rate of<br>
vaccine use is often attributed to uncertainty in the uniformity in dosing via the<br>
feed or water at the growout facility or by spray cabinet vaccination at the<br>
hatchery, which are the traditional routes and times of administration. There is<br>
increasing interest in improving the uniformity of vaccine delivery during<br>
administration at the hatchery and thereby providing more uniform protection<br>
within the flock.<br>
Recently, in ovo vaccination techniques have been found<br>
applicable to administration of a live oocyst-based coccidiosis vaccine (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,500,438; U.S. Patent No. 6,495,146; and U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,627,205; all to Pfizer, Inc.). The in ovo route of administration provides a<br>
convenient method of delivering a uniform dose of vaccine to each embryo while<br>
it is still in the egg. Delivery of avian vaccines in ovo is currently practiced for<br>
approximately 85% of the 9 billion broiler birds produced in the United States<br>
each year and in a growing percentage of the 21 billion broiler birds produced<br>
outside of the United States each year {see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,458,630 to<br>
the United States government). Therefore, the potential market for a live, in ovo-<br>
delivered coccidiosis vaccine is considerably larger than the current market for<br>
post hatch-delivered coccidiosis vaccines.<br>
Eimeria oocysts contain four sporocysts within the protective<br>
oocyst wall. Sporocysts may be used for various purposes, including vaccines,<br>
viability testing, sporozoite production, etc. Conventional methods of cracking<br>
oocysts and releasing sporocysts utilize glass beads. Shaking oocysts with glass<br>
beads causes the oocyst wall to crack and release the sporocysts held<br>
therewithin. However, considerable shaking is generally required to crack a high<br>
percentage of the oocysts, and the continued shaking action may degrade<br>
previously released sporocysts. Similar problems exist with other conventional<br>
methods of releasing sporocysts, such as using a tissue grinder to release<br>
sporocysts. Sporocysts released early in the process can be destroyed by<br>
continuing the grinding process.<br>
Other conventional methods of releasing sporocysts from oocysts<br>
involve chemically releasing sporocysts from oocysts. Typically, oocysts are<br>
suspended in a buffer containing, for example, CO2 gas. Cysteine hydrochloride<br>
may also be included. This process reduces disulfide bonds in the micropyle<br>
     region of the oocyst. Eventually, the sporocysts may be released through the loosened micropyle cap. Unfortunately, chemical release alone is not always an efficient method for sporocyst release.<br>
As such, conventional methods of releasing sporocysts from sporulated oocysts are inefficient and yield only a fraction of the potential viable sporocysts available. Accordingly, a need exists for improved ways of releasing sporocysts from oocysts and that overcome the problems associated with the conventional methods.<br>
SUMMARY In view of the above discussion, methods of releasing sporocysts from oocysts are provided wherein a solution of oocysts is subjected to controlled shear forces sufficient to rupture the oocyst walls and release viable sporocysts therefrom. According to some embodiments of the present invention, an aqueous solution of oocysts is passed through one or more Microfluidizer® processor chamber units under defined conditions of chamber diameter, chamber geometry, and pressure. Oocysts impact the wall of the chamber and are subjected to controlled, high shear forces, tearing open the oocyst wall and releasing the sporocysts intact. This method is particularly effective in releasing sporocysts because a high percentage of oocyst walls can be cracked allowing a high percentage of sporocysts to be recovered. Moreover, little damage is done to released sporocysts allowing a high percentage of the recovered sporocysts to remain viable.<br>
In some embodiments, the oocysts are treated to weaken the walls thereof prior to subjectiiiy the solution to controlled shear forces. For example, the oocysts may be thermally treated, chemically treated, enzymatically treated, or may be subjected to various combinations of thermal, chemical and enzymatic treatment.<br>
In some embodiments, the recovered sporocysts are cryopreserved for storage. In some embodiments, the recovered sporocysts are used to prepare vaccine and/or a diagnostic assay.<br>
In some embodiments, sporozoites are excysted from the<br>
recovered sporocysts. Tnese sporozoites may be used to prepare a vaccine<br>
and/or a diagnostic assay.<br>
Exemplary oocysts from which sporocysts may be recovered,<br>
according to embodiments of the present Invention, are Eimeria oocysts, such as<br>

flavescens oocysts, E. exigua oocysts, E. magria oocysts, E perforans oocysts,<br>
E. media oocysts, E. stiedai oocysts, and any combination thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, methods of releasing sporozoites from<br>
oocysts are provided wherein a solution of oocysts is subjected to controlled<br>
shear forces sufficient to rupture the oocyst walls and release sporozoites<br>
therefrom. According to some embodiments of the present invention, an<br>
aqueous solution of oocysts is passed through one or more Microfluidizer®<br>
processor chamber units under defined conditions of chamber diameter,<br>
chamber geometry, and pressure. Oocysts impact the wall of the chamber and<br>
are subjected to controlled, high shear forces, tearing open the oocyst wall and<br>
releasing the sporozoites intact.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are advantageous over<br>
conventional methods. For example, embodiments of the present invention<br>
produce repeatable, consistent yields of sporocysts. In contrast, conventional<br>
glass bead and tissue grinder methods may be subject to variations in the way<br>
they are performed by an operator and may lead to non-consistent yields of<br>
sporocysts. in addition, embodiments of the present invention are scalable<br>
allowing economical production of sporocysts on a large scale. In contrast,<br>
conventional glass bead and tissue grinding methods are not readily adapted to large-scale production.<br>

Referring to Figs. 1-2, methods of releasing sporocysts from<br>
sporulated oocysts, according to some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
will now be discussed. Initially, sporulated oocysts may be thermally and/or<br>
chemically and/or enzymatically pretreated to weaken the walls of the oocysts<br>
(Block 100). The weakening caused by thermal, chemical and/or enzymatic<br>
treatment causes the oocyst walls to become more susceptible to disruption by<br>
shear forces subsequently applied thereto. Exemplary thermal treatments<br>
include, but are not limited to, heating the oocysts to between 37'C and 41 °C for<br>
0.5 hour to 2 hours. Exemplary chemical treatments include, but are not limited<br>
to, hypochlorite solution or aqueous solutions containing dissolved carbon<br>
dioxide and cysteine hydrochloride, as well as taurodeoxycholic acid. Exemplary<br>
enzymatic treatments include, but are not limited to, pepsin and various<br>
phospholipases, for example. Thermally, chemically and/or enzymatically<br>
pretreating sporulated oocysts is optional and is not required in embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Moreover, particular types of sporulated oocysts may not<br>
require pretreatment to weaken the walls thereof. Various combinations of<br>
thermal, chemical, and/or enzymatic treatment may be used.<br>
An aqueous solution containing sporulated oocysts suspended<br>
therein is prepared (Block 110). Exemplary aqueous solutions include, but are<br>
not limited to. Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS), RPMI medium, DMEM medium, or the above solutions in combination<br>
with a protein such as casein or a protein hydrolysate such as casein<br>
hydrolysate or soy protein hydrolysate. The aqueous solution is then subjected<br>
to shear forces sufficient to rupture the oocysts' walls and release the sporocysts<br>
therefrom (Block 120). The released sporocysts are recovered from the aqueous<br>
solution (Block 130). The recovered sporocysts may proceed to subsequent<br>
processing (Block 140) and/or may be cryopreserved (Block 150).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, according to some embodiments of the present invention, subjecting an aqueous solution of oocysts to shear forces sufficient to rupture the oocyst walls and release sporocysts therefrom (Block 120) is performed by passing the aqueous solution under pressure (e.g., between about 2,000 psi and about 6,000 psi) through a Microfluidizer® processor chamber (Block 122). Microfluidizer® processors are available from the Microfluidics Corporation, 30 Ossipee Road, Newton, MA. Microfluidizer® processors allow high pressure streams of solutions to collide at ultra-high velocities in precisely defined microchannels or chambers. (Other cell disruption equipment can be used including, but not limited to, the Constant Cell Disruption System produced by Constant Systems Ltd., Daventry. Northants, NN11 4SD, England, UK). Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the use of Microfluidizer® processor chambers.<br>
A Microfluidizer® processor chamber subjects a solution flowing therethrough to combined forces of shear and impact. Each chamber is designed with a fixed-geometry, and is configured to accelerate a product stream to high velocities. The fixed-geometry configuration allows applied shear forces to be precisely controlled and monitored.<br>
Control of shear forces is achieved through the use of defined combinations of chamber geometry, chamber diameter, and applied pressure. Other aspects of the controlled process can include the characteristics and formulation of the solution used, including parameters such as viscosity, specific gravity, chemical composition, osmolality, pH and temperature. Optimized conditions can be determined by those of skill in the art using routine procedures. Consistency of the process may be ensured by performing te&amp;* luns under defined conditions using buffer alone and determining the flow rate. Tracking the flow rate by such a test over time yields an indication of wear in the equipment or other fault in the system, and corrective action may be taken to return the system to standard operating conditions.<br>
Exemplary Microfluidizer® processor chambers that may be used<br>
according to some embodiments of the present invention include chambers with<br>
"Y-shaped" and "Z-shaped" configurations. Y-shaped chambers include two<br>
entering flow paths that converge at a point ar.d exit as a single flow path. Z-<br>
shaped chambers have a single flow path with a Z-shaped path. Chamber<br>
configurations for optimal recovery of sporocysts may vary by species. Accordingly, different chamber configurations may be selected for different types of oocysts. In addition, Microfluidizer® processor chambers may be arranged in series.<br>
In addition, Microfluidizer® processor chambers may have different diameters. For example, diameters of between about 75 microns (µm) and about 500 µm may be utilized. Microfluidizer® processor chambers of different diameters may be arranged in series, also.<br>
Applicants have found that chambers having a diameter that is substantially equal to or larger than the diameter of the oocysts in solution are particularly effective. For example, for E. maxima oocysts, which are typically about 20 µm to 40 µm in diameter, a reaction chamber with a diameter of about 300 pm is preferred. However, diameters ranging from about 75 pm to about 400 pm may also be used. Typically, the flow path used is the Z configuration, although a Y configuration or other configuration may also be used. Flow rates normally range from about 500 mL per min to about 2000 mL per minute at<br>
f<br>
pressures ranging from 1000 to 5000 psi. The amount of shear force typically<br>
required to release sporocysts from E. maxima oocysts ranges from about 3.00 x<br>
105 sec-1 per minute to about 1.50 x 105 sec-1 perminute.<br>
For E. tenella oocysts, which are typically about 15 pm to 25 pm in<br>
diameter, and E. acervulina, which are typically about 10 pm to 15 pm in<br>
diameter, a Microfluidizer® processor reaction chamber with a diameter of 100<br>
pm is preferred. However, diameters ranging from about 75 pm to about 400 pm<br>
may also be used. Typically, the flow path used is the Z configuration, although a<br>
Y configuration or other configuration may also be used. Flow rates normally<br>
range from about 100 mL per min to about 250 mL per minute at pressures<br>
ranging from 1000 to 4000 psi. The amount of shear force typically required to<br>
release E. tenella or E. acervulina sporocysts from oocysts ranges from about<br>
1.00 X 10^ sec"^ per minute to about 3.00 x 10^ sec'' per minute.<br>
For any species of Eimeria oocysts, conditions resulting in lower<br>
shear forces may be used to release sporocysts from oocysts, especially when<br>
oocysts have been thermally, chemically, or enzymatically pre-treated. Although<br>
multiple passes through ths cfiamber may be used, a single pass is preferred.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to a particular<br>
chamber diameter for a particular oocyst. Embodiments of the present invention<br>
may utilize chambers having all types of configurations and diameters.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a Microfluidizer® processor 200 is illustrated.<br>
The illustrated Microfluidizer® processor 200 includes an inlet reservoir 202<br>
containing an aqueous solution of sporulated oocysts. The aqueous solution is<br>
pressurized and pumped via a pump 204 (e.g., constant pressure intensifier<br>
pump, etc.) through a chamber 206 (e.g., a Y-shaped, Z-shaped chamber, etc.).<br>
The oocysts in the pressurized aqueous solution are subjected to shear and<br>
impact forces in the chamber 206 causing sporocysts to be released from the<br>
oocyst walls. The aqueous solution containing the released sporocysts is<br>
collected in the outlet reservoir 208.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, according to some embodiments of the<br>
present invention, a percentage of sporocysts released and recovered from<br>
oocysts (i.e., sporocyst yield) may be determined (Block 160). Sporocyst yield<br>
may be assessed, for example, via microscopy. Sporocysts deemed recovered<br>
by microscopy may be either viable or non-viable or a mixture thereof. How/ever,<br>
the viability status may not be determinable by microscopy alone. Accordingly, a<br>
determination of a percentage of released sporocysts that are viable (i.e.,<br>
viability yield) may be performed, also. Determining viability yield may require an<br>
in vivo procedure. Appropriate in vivo procedures may include administering<br>
sporocyst preparations to avian subjects via oral gavage and comparing the<br>
resulting oocyst output with that obtained by administering intact oocysts of<br>
equivalent number.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, recovered sporocysts may be processed in<br>
various ways and for various purposes. For example, vaccines may be prepared<br>
from recovered sporocysts (Block 141) and cryopreserved for storage (Block<br>
142). Referring to Fig. 5, according to some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, recovered sporocysts may be processed to release (i.e., excyst)<br>
sporozoites therefrom (Block 143). The released sporozoites may be used to<br>
prepare vaccines (Block 144) or may be used for some other purpose. Vaccines<br>
prepared from excysted sporozoites may be cryopreserved for storage (Block<br>
145).<br>
Any type of oocyst may be processed in accordance with<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Particularly suitable oocysts are Eimeria<br>
oocysts including, but not limited to, E. maxima oocysts, E. mitis oocysts, E.<br>
tenella oocysts, E. acervulina oocysts, E. brunetti oocysts, E. necatrix oocysts,<br>
E. praecox oocysts, E. m/Vaf/oocysts, and any combination thereof, E.<br>
meleagrimitis oocysts, E. adenoeides oocysts, E. gallopavonis oocysts, E.<br>
dispersa oocysts, E. innocua oocysts, and E. subrotunda oocysts, and any<br>
combination thereof, E. zuemii oocysts, E. bovis oocysts, and any combination<br>
thereof, E. ahsata oocysts, E. bakuensis oocysts, E. crandallis oocysts, E. faurei<br>
oocysts, E. granulosa oocysts, E. intn'cata oocysts, E. marsica oocysts, E.<br>

oocysts, and any combination thereof, E. intestinalis oocysts, E. vejdovskyi<br>
oocysts, E. piriformis oocysts, E. coecicola oocysts, E. irresidua oocysts, E.<br>

Having described the present invention, the same will be explained<br>
in greater detail in the following examples, which are included herein for<br>
illustration purposes only, and which are not intended to be limiting to the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A series of experiments were performed to map out sporocyst<br>
recovery and oocyst cracking over a broad range of parameter values. Each<br>
experiment used a total of approximately 2x10® sporulated oocysts in 500 mL<br>
HBSS (4x10^ sporulated oocysts per mL); a sub-sample was taken for<br>
enumeration prior to Microfluidizer® processor treatment. Chamber diameters to<br>
be tested varied according to species: 1) E. maxima: 200, 300, 400 micron<br>
diametei chambers 2) E. tenella: 200, 300 micron diameter chambers; 3) E.<br>
acervulina: 125 micron diameter chamber. Single pass mode was used.<br>
Pressures ranging from 2,000 psig to 6,000 psig were used, depending on the<br>
study. After passing through the Microfluidizer® processor, the total volume was<br>
adjusted to 1L with HBSS, the sample was mixed, and a subsample was taken<br>
for enumeration. Typically, three replicate runs were made using each set of<br>
conditions.<br>
Percent sporocysts recovered and percent oocysts cracked were<br>
detemiined for eacii experiment using hemacytometer counts. Ideally, both<br>
percent sporocysts recovered and percent oocysts cracked would be 100%.<br>

Embodiments of the present invention provide a repeatable, scalable alternative for recovery of sporocysts over conventional tissue grinder, glass bead, and chemical release methods. Essentially quantitative recovery of sporocysts from E. maxima 1 and E. maxima 2 is provided. Nearly quantitative recovery of E. tenella sporocysts is observed. Recovery of E. acervulina oocysts is about 40-50%.<br>
Example 2<br>
Using cell disruption equipment to release sporocysts requires optimization of release conditions to ensure viability of released sporocysts. Viability may be assessed by providing a dose of sporocysts to birds and by enumerating the associated oocyst output resulting from the infection. Under varying conditions of cell disruption equipment chamber geometry and pressure, it is possible to efficiently release sporocysts from oocysts in a non-viable condition. That is, the infection produced in birds upon administration of the sporocysts may be lessened as compared to that achieved using sporocysts released by traditional methods such as glass beads. Conditions of chamber geometry and pressure must be carefully assessed to ensure that viable sporocysts are produced.<br>
Sporocysts vjere released from E. acen/ulina oocysts using either glass beads or the Microfluidizer® processor configured with a 100Z chamber at 2000 psi or 5000 psi. Sporocysts released by each method were then administered to chickens in a dose response model using 1000, 3000, and 5000 sporocysts per dose. Three replicate pens were used for each treatment, with nine birds per replicate. An oocyst control at 1250 sporulated oocysts per dose representing 5000 sporocysts was also included in the test. Oocysts were collected from days 4 to 7 post gavage into a solution of 10% citric acid, 0.75% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.25% propionic acid in water. Feces containing oocysts were brought to a uniform volume using water, blended, and subsampled. Oocysts were enumerated using the McMaster's method. Results are shown in the table below:<br>
Effect (Table removed) <br>
of Pressure on the Viability of E. acervulina Sporocysts	<br>
Statistical comparisons were made between treatments receiving sporocysts. Different letters in common represent significant differences to p=.05.<br>
Results indicate that sporocysts produced using the Microfluidizer© processor at 2000psi were as viable as sporocysts produced using the traditional glass bead method at each dose, while sporocysts produced at 5000psi using the Microfluidizert® processor were significantly less viable than those produced using the glass bead method at each dose. The range of pressure which yields viable sporocysts must therefore be determined experimentally.<br>
Example 3<br>
The smaWer Eimeria species, including E. acervulina {~12 micron length) and E. tenella (-20 micron length) are observed to be less susceptible to shear than the larger E. maxima species (-40 microns length). Generating higher levels of shear by increasing the pressure in the Microfluidizer® system can improve microscopic yield of sporocysts from oocysts for any species, but is especially required for efficient release of the smaller species; however, increasing pressure can also decrease viability. Lowering pressure to improve viability inherently sacrifices yield. Pre-treatments have been developed to condition the wall of the oocysts to provide both improved microscopic yield and improved viability.<br>
A study was performed to examine the effect of pre-treatment of oocysts using a combination of a bile salt (taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), an<br>
anaerobic environment (bubbled carbon dioxide), and a warm temperature (37X for 1h). The objectives of the study were to detenmine the in vitro recovery (via microscopy) and the in vivo viability (via oocyst output) of released sporocysts.<br>
The following treatment groups were established: (1) E. acervulina sporulated oocyst control; 1000 sporulated oocysts per dose; (2) Glass bead-produced sporocyst control; 4000 sporocysts per dose; (3) Microfluldizer® produced sporocyst control without pretreatment; 100 µm chamber; 2,000 psi; 4000 sporocysts per dose; (4) Microfluidizer®-produced sporocysts with pretreatment including 0.75% taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and bubbled carbon dioxide at 37°C for 1 h; 100 pm chamber; 2,000 psi; 4000 sporocysts per dose; (5) Microfluidizer®-produced sporocysts with pre-treatment including 0.75% TDCA and bubbled carbon dioxide at 37X for 1h;100 µm chamber; 3,000 psi; 4000 sporocysts per dose; (6) Microfluidizert®-produced sporocysts with pretreatment including 0.75% TDCA and bubbled carbon dioxide at 37'C for 1 h; 100 µm chamber; 4,000 psi; 4000 sporocysts per dose. Residual intact oocysts and oocyst shells were removed from the sporocyst preparations using Percoll. Sporocyst doses were delivered to birds at 4,000 sporocysts per dose to provide doses equivalent to the 1,000 oocyst per dose control, as each oocyst contains four sporocysts.<br>
Recovery of sporocysts from oocysts was evaluated microscopically. Results for the MicrofluidizerO-produced materials are summarized in the table below:<br>
Microscopic Recovery of E. acervulina Sporocysts using Pre-Treatment	<br>
(Table removed) <br>
Pre-treatment improved recovery of sporocysts approximately six-fold at 2000 psi, and at increasing pressures, further improvement in microscopic recovery was observed.<br>
For the in vivo assessment, each treatment used 5 replicate pens<br>
with nine birds per pen. Treatments were administered via oral gavage to the crop. Feces were collected into a solution of 10% citric acid, 0.75% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.25% propionic acid in water from days 4 to 7 post gavage. Feces containing oocysts were brought to a uniform volume, blended, and subsampled. Oocysts were enumerated using the McMaster's method.<br>
The viability of sporocysts produced using the stated release methods was assessed by comparing oocyst output per bird relative to the glass bead-produced sporocyst control. Results are summarized in the table below:<br>
Viabilityof E. acen/ulina Sporocysts Released from Pre-Treated Oocysts	<br>
(Table removed) <br>
There were no significant differences among treatments in mean oocyst output per bird (p&gt;.05). Pre-treatment provided improved viability of released sporocysts across a wide range of pressure. In some cases, the viability of sporocysts released from pretreated oocysts by the Microfluidizer® method was numerically higher than that of the glass bead-released sporocysts. The overall effect of pre-treatment was thus two-fold, improving both recovery from oocysts during the release step and viability.<br>
