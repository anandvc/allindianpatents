[Background of the invention]<br>
The 1-methylcarbapenem derivative of formula (I) is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication Hei-10-204086 and Hei-11-071277. This compound (I) exhibits excellent antibiotic activity not only against Gram-positive bacterial strains but also against Gram-negative bacterial strains and can be expected to become a useful antibiotic agent. However, the compound (I) prepared according to the Example of Japanese Patent Application Publication Hei-11-071277 was obtained by lyophilization as a non-crystalline powder. This powder is unstable and is a material difficult to keep for a long time. There are many problems in practical use of the powder as a medicament, especially as an antibiotic agent. The inventors made many efforts in order to solve these problems and have found that certain crystalline forms of compound (I) are extremely stable compared to the non-crystalline powder of compound (I) and are useful medicaments, especially, practically useful antibiotic agents. The stable crystalline forms of this invention include a crystalline form of compound (I) 1/2 carbonate containing 1/2 ethanol (1-1), a crystalline form of<br>

3)  by isolation of the crystals and then drying of the crystals.<br>
Precipitation of the crystals begins spontaneously in the vessel, or precipitation can also begin or be accelerated by addition of crystalline seeds or by mechanical stimulations such as ultrasonic wave irradiation and scratching on the surface of the vessel.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compound (I) are preferably hydrochlorides, sulfates and carbonates; most preferably carbonates. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared by addition of necessary amount of a desired acid or base to a solution of compound (I).<br>
When solutions of the compound (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are treated, the solutions of these compounds are usually treated between 0 and 60°C in order to avoid decomposition of these compounds.<br>
The preferred temperature of crystallization of these compounds is between 0 and 10°C.<br>
Methods of concentration of solutions of the compound (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are an evaporation method using a rotary evaporator under reduced or normal pressure upon heating and a concentration method using a reverse osmotic membrane. The reverse osmotic membrane used in concentration of an aqueous solution can be selected from polyacrylonitrile membranes, polyvinyl alcohol membranes, polyamide membranes and cellulose acetate membranes.<br>
Examples of solvents which can readily dissolve compound (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are water, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and methanol, preferably water.<br>

gradually cooling to between 0 and 10°C or accomplished by gradual addition of an appropriate solvent which can slightly dissolve compound (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as ethanol or acetone, to the saturated aqueous solution, if necessary, followed by cooling.<br>
Crystalline forms of this invention preferably precipitate when aqueous solutions of compound (I) or pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts are concentrated, if necessary, followed by the addition of a solvent which can slightly dissolve these compounds, followed by cooling. More preferably crystals of this invention precipitate when aqueous solutions of compound (I) or pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts thereof are concentrated, if necessary, followed by the addition of ethanol or acetone and then cooling.<br>
Most preferably, the preferred crystalline form of compound (I-1) precipitates when an aqueous solution of compound (I) is concentrated, followed by saturation with carbon dioxide, addition of ethanol and cooling; the preferred crystalline form of compound (1-2) precipitates when an aqueous solution of compound (I) is concentrated, followed by the addition of ethanol and by cooling (preferably by irradiation with ultrasonic waves); the preferred crystalline form of compound (I) precipitates when an aqueous solution of compound (I) is concentrated, followed by cooling; the preferred crystalline form of compound (1-3) precipitates when an aqueous solution of compound (I) is concentrated, followed by addition of ethanol and by cooling.<br>
The precipitated crystals are isolated, for example, by filtration, centrifugation or decantation. If necessary, the isolated crystals can be washed with an appropriate solvent. Preferably the crystals are washed at first with the solvent which is used in crystallization, and then washed with a solvent such as ethanol, acetone, and ether.<br>
The isolated crystals are dried at between 10 and 50°C, preferably at between 20 and 30°C until the weight of the crystals become constant. If necessary, they may be dried in the presence of drying agents such as silica gel and calcium chloride under reduced pressure.<br>
The crystalline forms of compound (1-1), (1-2), (I) and (1-3) are easy to treat practically as a medicament and are extremely stable compared to the lyophilized powder of compound (I) which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication Hei-11-071277.<br>
