				<td>AN ORAL DOSAGE DELIVERY VEHICLE COMPRISING AN EDIBLE FILM WITH A UNIFORMLY<br>
The present invention relates to devices and methods for the storage and dispensing<br>
of an edible, thin, water-soluble, rapid dissolve dosage form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF RELATED TECHNOLOGY<br>
Water-soluble thin films have recently become very popular as a form of breath<br>
freshener. These films generally include a breath freshening agent in a polymer film. These<br>
films have a convenient small size which contributes to their popularity.<br>
However, such films and their current packaging have several disadvantages. The<br>
films themselves are typically too thin to support other active ingredients, such as a<br>
pharmaceutical active. In addition, the packaging does not provide an effective air/moisture<br>
barrier. The result is a film that frequently dries out, becoming too brittle for use.<br>
Furthermore, when the films are placed in the packaging, they are usually stacked, and<br>
frequently adhere to an adjacent film. Therefore, a person attempting to remove a single<br>
film from the packaging may inadvertently remove two or more.<br>
It is desirable to provide a film and packaging that includes a barrier to moisture, air,<br>
and light, which can interfere with the quality of the film product and the active ingredients<br>
contained within the film. Ideally, this film will be capable of supporting not only a breath<br>
freshener as the active, but also pharmaceutical products. It is further desirable to provide a<br>
method of dispensing the films, wherein only the desired number of films may be removed<br>
at a time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an oral dosage delivery vehicle including an edible<br>
film having a sheet-like construction, wherein the film comprises dosage units releasably<br>
joined by one or more weakened sections, which permit said dosage units to be detached<br>
from the film. Desirably the weakened sections include a perforated or scored configuration<br>
that may be cut into the film. More desirably, the individual dosage units are uniform in<br>
their composition and include a uniformly distributed active ingredient, such as a drug,<br>
cosmetic, or bioactive agent and the like.<br>
The present invention also provides a package for the storage and dispensing of an<br>
edible sheet-like rapid dissolve dosage form, such as a thin film. The invention includes a<br>
pouch into which a sheet-like dosage form has been placed. The pouch includes top and<br>
bottom layers that are sealed at the edges leaving a space between them for storing the<br>
sheet-like dosage form. The pouch may also include a means for resealing to prevent<br>
additional introduction of light, moisture and/or air. Such resealing means may include<br>
adhesive coatings, mechanical closures, such as those found on resealable plastic bags and<br>
other similar resealing means.<br>
While a variety of film-forming techniques may be used to produce the rapid<br>
dissolving sheet-like dosage forms of the present invention, the present invention also<br>
includes a unique method of producing the edible dosage forms such that uniform<br>
distribution of the compositional components are evenly distributed throughout the film.<br>
This process is described in detail in co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/074,272,<br>
entitled "Thin Film with Non-Self-Aggregating Uniform Heterogeneity and Drug Delivery<br>
Systems Made Therefrom", the subject matter of which is herein incorporated by its<br>
entirety. The process provides dosage forms that consistently include substantially the same<br>
amount of me active ingredient and may include a wide variety of active ingredients,<br>
including pharmaceutical actives.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of storing an edible<br>
sheet-like rapid dissolve dosage form. The method includes first preparinga shcet-like<br>
dosage form that includes one or more unit doses of an active ingredient. The sheet may be<br>
separated by weakened sections between individual units or segments, desirably of<br>
substantially equal area, which represent individual dosage units or a predetermined fraction<br>
of a dosage unit. The sheet is placed into a pouch that has top and bottom layers, which<br>
desirably include a barrier layer. The top and bottom layers are sealed at the edges, which<br>
may be through the use of an adhesive, desirably, one that is heat sealable, pressure-<br>
sensitive or which forms a bond at room temperature.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention provides a method of dispensing a<br>
sheet-like dosage form. First, a sheet-like dosage form that includes one or more doses of<br>
an active ingredient is prepared. Then the dosage form may be separated at weakened<br>
sections therein to form individual segments or units, desirably of substantially equal area,<br>
representing either an individual dosage unit or a fraction thereof, as described above. The<br>
sheet is placed in a pouch having top and bottom layers that may include a barrier material.<br>
The pouch is sealed at the edges. The dosage form is dispensed by opening a portion of the<br>
pouch, desirably a portion of the edge, then separating one or more sections of the dosage<br>
form from the sheet along the weakened sections, and removing the separated dosage unit(s)V<br>
from the pouch. The pouch may then be resealed. \/ACCOMPANYING<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention includes a "sheet-like" dosage form or a film. For the<br>
purposes of this invention the term "sheet-like" dosage form, "sheet," and film are meant to<br>
include a water soluble delivery system having a thickness of less than about 15mils. The<br>
sheet-like dosage forms are desirably edible and contain an active ingredient.<br>
The sheets or films 5 of the water-soluble rapid dissolve dosage forms, which may<br>
include one or more dosage forms 1, may include weakened sections, as shown in FIG. 1-3.<br>
The weakened section is designed such that application of a bending force thereat breaks<br>
apart adjacent units from each other. The weakened sections 2 in the sheet may form<br>
straight lines in either a vertical direction or a horizontal direction, or combinations of both,<br>
although lines which are not straight may also be used. The weakened sections will divide<br>
the sheet into segments that represent individual doses of an active. The segments may be<br>
in a variety of different shapes and sizes including square, rectangle, triangle, trapezoid,<br>
circle, ellipse, etc. Desirably, the lines will combine to provide sections of substantially<br>
equal area. Each section will represent either an individual dosage form or a predetermined<br>
fraction of a dosage form. For example, a child dose may be one-half of an adult dose for a<br>
particular active, or where a large film is required for a particular dose, the film may be<br>
divided to provide ease of administration. For example, in Figure 2, which shows a sheet<br>
perforated into two sections, each section may be a dosage unit, or the entire sheet may be a<br>
single dosage unit.<br>
The weakened sections themselves may take on a variety of different configurations,<br>
as shown in FIGS. 11-13. In general, a weakened section of the sheet is a location of the<br>
sheet that has been altered to permit separation of sections of the film. Desirably, the<br>
weakened sections are formed so that the individual dosage units are of substantially<br>
identical dimensions. Where the dosage form includes an active, there is uniformity among<br>
dosage units that have been separated, desirably where there is less than 10% variance<br>
among the individual dosage units both before and after separation. The weakened sections<br>
may be in any configuration that permits one section of the film to be separated from the<br>
remaining film. Examples of weakened sections include perforations or scored areas that<br>
form voids 30 in the material, as in FIG 11. As shown in FIG 12 and FIG 13, the voids 30a<br>
and 30b, respectively, may either completely or partially penetrate the film.<br>
Other examples of weakened sections may be used when uniformity of film size is<br>
not an issue, including where the dosage form does not incorporate a drug active. Examples<br>
include narrower sections 32 of the film 5, as shown in FIG. 14, and areas that have less<br>
thickness 34 than the surrounding film, as shown in FIG 15. The weakened sections may be<br>
formed by cutting the film, by casting the film into a pre-determined shape, or by casting<br>
the film onto a patterned surface that results specifically selected thinner areas of the film.<br>
The weakened sections, described above, serve as break-points where the film is<br>
intended to be separated into individual dosage units. The film itself is generally flexible to<br>
avoid inadvertent or premature separation and breaking of dosage units. However, the<br>
weakened sections allow the film to be separated at pre-determined segments that will<br>
represent the individual doses. This separation may be by breaking, bending, tearing, or<br>
otherwise detaching the individual segments the film or sheet-like construction. The dosage<br>
forms may include a line formed of an edible ink along the weakened sections. Such a line<br>
serves as, a "safety" indication line to visibly indicate to the user that they have broken off<br>
the appropriate dosage unit. Particularly where a perforated dosage form is used, this will<br>
assure that the user has detached the dosage form at the appropriate location. This may be<br>
accomplished by perforating the film with a serrated knife-like instrument, which may<br>
include edible ink liners that mark the film as it is cut. Other methods of forming the safety<br>
line, such as printing, may be used.<br>
The surface of the film may either be smooth, or altered in a way to increase the<br>
surface area of the film. Where the surface area is altered, it may include voids 42 or holes<br>
as shown in FIG. 18. The voids will be placed in the film in a uniform manner, which does<br>
not affect the uniformity of the distribution of any active that the film may contain. The<br>
effect of the voids is an increase in the surface area of the film, which will speed the<br>
dissolution time of the film when administered, including an increased speed of dissolution<br>
of the film in the mouth. As shown in FIGS. 19-21, the voids may take a variety of<br>
different shapes, and may go either completely through the depth of the material as the<br>
voids 42a of FIG. 19 or partially through as the voids 42b and 42c, of FIGS. 20 - 21,<br>
respectively. The alteration of the surface area of the film will be conducted in such a way<br>
that will maintain the strength of the film, unlike the alteration at the weakened sections.<br>
Ideally, the voids are formed by either cutting the film or by casting the film on a template<br>
to produce a specific pattern.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, the sheet-like dosage form 5 may include a<br>
substantially water-insoluble backing layer 25. While the films 5 may be self-supporting,<br>
the second carrier layer 25 may act as a support layer for the dosage form 5. The carrier<br>
layer 25 may either be continuous, without the inclusion of weakened sections 2 as in FIG.<br>
16, or it may include weakened sections 2a corresponding to the weakened sections 2 of the<br>
film 5 to allow the second layer 25 to separated along with a corresponding section of the<br>
dosage form 5, as shown in FIG 17.<br>
The edible sheet-like dosage forms of the present invention include a water-soluble<br>
polymer. Useful water-soluble polymers for the present invention include cellulosic<br>
materials, gums, proteins, starches, and combinations thereof.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that dosage units or a portion thereof may<br>
easily be dispensed. For example, a 10 mg dosage unit may itself contain a break-point<br>
section, i.e., a perforated section, to allow the patient to divide the taking of the required 10<br>
mg dose over two different time intervals, or to simply make it easier to ingest at one time.<br>
Examples of cellulosic materials include, without limitation, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of water-soluble gums include gum arabic, xanthan gum, tragacanth,<br>
acacia, carageenan, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, alginates and combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of other polymeric materials include polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly(meth)acrylate, poly(meth)copolymers and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Useful starches include gelatinized, modified or unmodified starches. The source of<br>
the starches may vary and include tapioca, rice, corn, potato, wheat and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Useful water-soluble protein polymers gelatin, zein, gluten, soy protein, soy protein<br>
isolate, whey protein, whey protein isolate, casein, levin, collagen and combinations thereof.<br>
Additional water-soluble polymers include dextrin, dextran and combinations<br>
thereof, as well as chitin, chitosin or combinations thereof, and polydextrose.<br>
The sheet-like dosage forms of the present invention further include an active<br>
component selected from cosmetic agents, pharmaceutical agents, bioactive agents,<br>
including antigens, such as ragweed pollen, and combinations thereof. The active<br>
component may be present in any amount effective for the intended treatment. If is<br>
particularly desirable and an advantage of the present invention that the active component<br>
can be included in high loads. For example, the active component may be present in<br>
amounts up to about 60% by weight of the total composition and desirably in amounts of<br>
0.01% to about 50% by weight of total composition.<br>
The active components that may be incorporated into the films of the present<br>
invention include, without limitation, medicaments, flavors, fragrances, enzymes,<br>
preservatives, sweetening agents, colorants, spices, vitamins and combinations thereof.<br>
A wide variety of medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions may be included<br>
in the dosage forms of the present invention. Examples of useful drugs include ace-<br>
inhibitors, antianginal drugs, anti-arrhythmias, anti-asthmatics, anti-cholesterolemics,<br>

The ingredients of inventive compositions A-J were combined by mixing until a<br>
uniform mixture was achieved. Vacuum was then applied over 20 min. starting at 500<br>
mmHg and ending at 660 mmHg until all air was removed from the suspension. The<br>
compositions were then cast onto a silicone coated paper using a 200 micron spiral wound<br>
rod and a K control Coater Model 101 (RK Print Coat Inst. Ltd.). These films were then<br>
dried by applying heat at 90°C to the bottom of the film. No external thermal air currents<br>
were present above the film. The films were dried to less than about 6% by weight water in<br>
about 4 to 6 minutes. The films were flexible, self-supporting and provided a uniform<br>
distribution of the components within the film.<br>
The layers that form the pouch of the present invention may be made of a variety of<br>
different materials and constructions. As shown in FIG. 6, may themselves include one or<br>
more layers that are laminated together with an adhesive. A variety of different materials<br>
may be used for each of the layers. Desirably, the top and bottom layers will each include a<br>
laminate of at least two layers. More desirably, a three-layer laminate will be included. The<br>
three layer laminate will include an outer layer 16, an inner layer 17, and an intermediate<br>
layer 18 that include an adhesive 15 dispersed therebetween.<br>
One effective barrier material is a metal foil, such as aluminum, which provides a<br>
barrier to light, moisture arid air. Depending on the barrier requirements of the film and any<br>
active contained therein, other materials may be selected for the various layers. These<br>
materials may include paper, polyolefins, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, polyester,<br>
hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate co-polymer and blends thereof.<br>
The layers may also include, where necessary, an anti-static agent, anti-fogging<br>
agent, ultraviolet light absorber, antioxidant, plasticizer, lubricant, nucleating agent,<br>
dispersant, colorant, anti-fungus agent, anti-microbial agents, inorganic filler, and the like.<br>
In. one aspect of the invention, the layers may be laminated together by first<br>
dispersing an adhesive between the layers which may then be co-extruded to form the multi-<br>
layered packaging of the present invention. The adhesive may include polyolefin resins<br>
such as those modified with unsaturated carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof. The<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid may include, without limitation acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,<br>
maleic acid, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid and the like, as well<br>
as esters and anhydrides thereof.<br>
FIG 4 shows layers of a pouch containing the sheet-like dosage forms 5. The pouch<br>
includes top 3 and bottom 4 layers, which may each include a multi-layered laminate<br>
material, which is sealed along the perimeter as shown in FIG. 5. This may be<br>
accomplished, for example, by heat sealing or with an adhesive, such as a pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive.<br>
The resulting pouch may also be resealable along a portion of its perimeter as shown<br>
in FIGS. 7-9 and 9a. As shown in FIG. 7, this is accomplished by providing a portion of the<br>
perimeter with a pressure sensitive adhesive 7 between the top 3 and bottom 4 layers. At<br>
this point along the perimeter, the top and bottom layers may be separated to allow removal<br>
of a dosage form and then resealing. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, a portion of<br>
the perimeter may be sealed and resealed by forming a zipper track 8.along the top layer 3<br>
and a corresponding track 9 along the bottom layer 4 of a portion of the pouch. The two<br>
tracks should be formed such that they can engage, forming a seal along a portion of the<br>
perimeter. The track may be engaged by either manual pressure, or by the use of a zipper<br>
10. FIG 9a adds a "tamper resistant" feature to the packaging, where another layer of<br>
material 19 is included which covers the resealable zipper. This may either be attached by<br>
the use of an adhesive to the top 3 and bottom 4 layers, or alternatively may form an<br>
additional layer over the length of the top 3 and bottom 4 layers (not shown). This allows<br>
the pouch to be opened by the consumer by first removing the surrounding layer 19,<br>
desirably at a perforated section 22 to permit access to the resealable opening.<br>
More than one sheet of the dosage form may be included within the pouch. For<br>
example, two or more sheets may be stacked on top of each other. As shown in FIG 10, a<br>
non-water soluble support film 11, such as a layer of polyolefin, also in the form of a sheet,<br>
may be placed between the sheets of water-soluble dosage forms to prevent the dosage 5<br>
forms in the two or more sheets from adhering to each other.<br>
To dispense a dosage form, the pouch is first opened. This is by either by tearing the<br>
pouch open or by separating the top and bottom layers of the pouch. The sheet may either<br>
be removed from, the pouch, or desirably, where the top and bottom layers are separated, the<br>
film is presented apart from the top and bottom pouch layers, which are peeled away, to<br>
provide greater ease in dispensing. In one embodiment, the top and bottom pouch layers are<br>
peeled apart at one end to present the dosage form in an erect or vertical position for easy<br>
handling. Then, the unit sections of the film/dosage form may be separated by tearing along<br>
the weakened or perforated sections to separate a dose, or fraction thereof, from the sheet.<br>
The remainder of the sheet may then be returned to the pouch until a future dose is needed.<br>
While there have been described what are presently believed to be the certain<br>
desirable embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that changes and<br>
modifications maybe made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it<br>
is intended to include all such changes and modifications as fall within the true scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
