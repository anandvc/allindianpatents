09/826,422 of Maslov et al., filed April 5, 2001, U.S. Application number 09/966,102, of<br>
Maslov et aL, filed October 1,2001, and U.S. Application number 09/993,596 of Pyntikov et<br>
al, filed November 27, 2001, all commonly assigned with the present application. The<br>
disclosures of these applications are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to rotary electric motors, more particularly to the precise<br>
control of brushless permanent magnet motors.<br>
Background<br>
The above-identified, copending patent applications describe the challenges of<br>
developing efficient electric motor drives for vehicles, as a viable alternative to combustion<br>
engines. Electronically controlled pulsed energization of windings of motors offers me prospect<br>
of more flexible management of motor characteristics. By control of pulse width, duty cycle,<br>
and switched application of a battery source to appropriate stator windings, functional versatility<br>
mat is virtually indistinguishable from alternating current synchronous motor operation can be<br>
achieved. The use of permanent magnets in conjunction with such, windings is advantageous in<br>
limiting current consumption.<br>
In a vehicle drive environment it is highly desirable to attain smooth operation over a<br>
wide speed range, while maintaining a high torque output capability at minimum power<br>
consumption. Motor structural arrangements described in the copending applications<br>
contribute to these objectives. Electromagnet core segments may be configured as isolated<br>
magnetically permeable structures in an annular ring to provide increased flux concentration.<br>
Isolation of the electromagnet core segments permits individual concentration of flux in the<br>
magnetic cores, with a minimum of flux loss or deleterious transformer interference effects<br>
with other electromagnet members.<br>
Precision controlled performance within brushless motor applications involves the<br>
fusion of nonlinear feedforward compensation coupled with current feedback elements.<br>
However, feedforward compensation expressions typically rely heavily upon various circuit<br>
parameters, such as phase resistance, phase self-inductance and the like, which are depicted<br>
illustratively in the equivalent circuit diagram for an individual motor phase in Fig. 1. V1 (t)<br>
denotes the per-phase voltage input, R1 denotes the per-phase winding resistance, and L1<br>
represents the per-phase self-inductance. E1 (t) represents the opposing back-emf voltage, of<br>
the motor per phase and can be approximated by the following expression:<br><br>
where kn denotes the per-phase back-emf voltage coefficient, ?(t) represents the rotor<br>
velocity, Nr denotes the number of permanent magnet pairs, and ?1 (t) represents the relative<br>
displacement between the / phase winding and a rotor reference position.<br>
Due to phenomena affected by mechanical/manufacturing tolerances and other<br>
structural characteristics, each motor phase will exhibit a range of values for each circuit<br>
element Factors that can affect the magnitudes of the circuit parameters include: the net flux<br>
linkage of the electromagnet core; fluctuations in the inductance of the core with respect to<br>
the electrical circuit; variations in the resistance of the phase winding due to changes in<br>
manufacturing tolerances such as the cross sectional area and winding tension; variations in<br>
the permeability of the core (related to the grade and me processing and finishing history of<br>
the material); phase winding technique (uniform or scrambled wound) or the build quality of<br>
the coils on each stator core; position of the electromagnet and permanent magnet interaction<br>
(i.e., permeance of the magnetic circuit); variations in the air gap flux density, which is<br>
dependent on the permanent magnet rotor magnet sub assembly; residual magnetic flux<br>
density; biasing magnetic field due to external magnetic fields; shape of coil wire<br>
(rectangular, circular or helical); winding factor achieved in the coil; manufacturing<br>
tolerances achieved in the core geometry which could alter the cross sectional tolerance of the<br>
core; the effective length over which the coil is wound.<br>
Typically, motor control strategies assume uniformity of parameter values over the<br>
entire motor. One median parameter value is taken to represent all corresponding circuit<br>
elements of the motor. This lumped parameter approach often leads to degradation in<br>
tracking performance due to over/under compensation of the contro1 strategy due to parameter<br>
value mismatch within individual phase compensation routines. Such assumed parameters<br>
are prone to even greater discrepancies with stator structures configured as autonomous<br>
ferromagnetically isolated core components. Thus, the need exists for an individualized<br>
circuit parameter compensation that accounts for the parameter variations in the separate<br>
phase windings and stator phase component structures.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention fulfills this need, while maintaining the benefits of the separated<br>
and ferromagnetically isolated individual stator core element configurations such as disclosed<br>
in the copending applications. The ability of the present invention to implement a control<br>
strategy that compensates for individual phase circuit elements offers a higher degree of<br>
precision controllability since each phase control loop is closely matched with its<br>
corresponding winding and structure. This ability is obtained, at least in part, by establishing<br>
in a control system for a multiphase motor one or more sets of parameters, the parameters of<br>
each set specifically matched with characteristics of a respective stator phase. Successive<br>
switched energization of each phase winding is governed by a controller that generates signals<br>
in accordance with the parameters associated with the stator phase component for the phase<br>
winding energized. Such control provides advantages with motors of a variety of<br>
construction and can be applied to a motor in which each stator phase component comprises a<br>
ferromagnetically isolated stator electromagnet, the electromagnet core elements being<br>
separated from direct contact with each other and formed with separate phase windings.<br>
A digital signal processor may be utilized that applies an algorithm incorporating the<br>
parameters as constant values, the parameters for a particular phase being accessed for<br>
generating the appropriate control signals for energizing that phase. Other parameters are<br>
variable in dependence upon selected states of me system, such as position, temperature and<br>
other external conditions. Alternatively, the controller may be provided with a separate loop<br>
for each phase, each loop executing a control algorithm containing the parameters for the<br>
respective phase. The algorithms may contain components based on the current sensed in<br>
each phase, the sensed position and speed of the rotor, the sensed conditions received as input<br>
signals to the controller.<br>
The present invention is particularly advantageous in applications in which the motor<br>
is intended to track a variable user initiated input, such as electric vehicle operation. In<br>
response to torque command input signals, per-phase desired current trajectories are selected<br>
by the controller in accordance with an expression that includes the particular parameters for<br>
each phase.<br>
Additional advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those<br>
skilled in this art from the following detailed description, wherein only the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention is shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best<br>
mode contemplated of carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable<br>
of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in<br>
various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings<br>
and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a motor control system in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Multiphase motor 10 is comprises rotor 20 and stator 30. The stator has a<br>
plurality of phase windings that are switchably energized by driving current supplied from d-c<br>
power source 40 via electronic switch sets 42. The switch sets are coupled to controller 44<br>
via gate drivers 46. Controller 44 has one or more user inputs and a plurality of inputs for<br>
motor conditions sensed during operation. Current in each phase winding is sensed by a<br>
respective one of a plurality of current sensors 48 whose outputs are provided to controller 44.<br>
The controller may have a plurality of inputs for this purpose or, in the alternative, signals<br>
from the current sensors may be multiplexed and connected to a single controller input.<br>
Rotor position sensor 46 is connected to another input of controller 44 to provide position<br>
signals thereto. The output of the position sensor is also applied to speed approximator 50,<br>
which converts the position signals to speed signals to be applied to another input of<br>
controller 44.<br>
The sequence controller may comprise a microprocessor or equivalent<br>
microcontroller, such as Texas Instrument digital signal processor TMS320LF2407APG. The<br>
switch sets may comprise a plurality of MOSFET H-Bridges, such as International Rectifier<br>
IRFIZ48N-ND. The gate driver may comprise Intersil MOSFET gate driver HEP4082IB. The<br>
position sensor may comprise any known sensing means, such as a Hall effect devices<br>
(Allegro Microsystems 92B5308), giant magneto resistive (GMR) sensors, capacitive rotary<br>
sensors, reed switches, pulse wire sensors including amorphous sensors, resolvers, optical<br>
sensors and the like. Hall effect current sensors, such as F.W. Bell SM-1S, may be utilized<br>
for currents sensors 48. The speed detector 50 provides an approximation of the time<br>
derivative of the sensed position signals.<br>
Fig. 3 is a partial circuit diagram of a switch set and driver for an individual stator<br>
core segment winding. Stator phase winding 34 is connected in a bridge circuit of four FETs.<br>
It is to be understood that any of various known electronic switching elements may be used<br>
for directing driving current in the appropriate direction to stator winding 34 such as, for<br>
example, bipolar transistors. FET 53 and FET 55 are connected in series across the power<br>
source, as are FET 54 and FET 56. Stator winding 34 is connected between the connection<br>
nodes of the two series FET circuits. Gate driver 46 is responsive to control signals received<br>
from the sequence controller 44 to apply activation signals to the gate terminals of the FETs.<br>
FETs 53 and 56 are concurrently activated for motor current flow in one direction. For<br>
current flow in the reverse direction, FETs 54 and 55 are concurrently activated. Gate driver<br>
46 alternatively may be integrated in sequence controller 44.<br>
The motor of the present invention is suitable for use in driving a vehicle wheel of an<br>
automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, or the like. Fig. 4 is a cutaway drawing of the motor<br>
structure that can be housed within a vehicle wheel, the stator rigidly mounted to a stationary<br>
shaft and surrounded by a rotor for driving the wheel. The motor 10 comprises annular<br>
permanent magnet rotor 20 separated from the stator by a radial air gap. The rotor and stator<br>
are configured coaxially about an axis of rotation, which is centered in the stationary shaft.<br>
The stator comprises a plurality of ferromagnetically isolated elements, or stator groups. Core<br>
segments 32, made of magnetically permeable material separated from direct contact with<br>
each other, have respective winding portions 34 formed on each pole. In this example, seven<br>
stator groups are shown, each group comprised of two salient electromagnet poles allocated<br>
circumferentially along the air gap. The rotor comprises a plurality of permanent magnets 22,<br>
circumferentially distributed about the air gap and affixed to an annular back plate 24.<br>
Reference is made to the Maslov et al. application 09/966,102, discussed above, for a more<br>
detailed discussion of a motor embodying this construction. It should be appreciated,<br>
however, that the vehicle context is merely exemplary of a multitude of particular<br>
applications in which the motor of the present invention may be employed. The concepts of<br>
the invention, more fully described below, are also applicable to other permanent magnet<br>
motor structures, including a unitary stator core that supports all of the phase windings.<br>
In the vehicle drive application example, one of the user inputs to the controller<br>
represents required torque indicated by the user's throttle command. An increase in throttle is<br>
indicative of a command to increase speed, which is realized by an increase in torque.<br>
Another external input to the controller processor may include a brake signal that is generated<br>
when the driver operates a brake pedal or handle. The processor may respond by immediately<br>
deactivating the motor drive or, instead, vary the drive control to reduce torque and speed. A<br>
separate external deactivation signal can be applied to immediately respond to the driver's<br>
command.<br>
The control system torque tracking functionality should maintain steady state<br>
operation for a constant input command through varying external conditions, such as changes<br>
in driving conditions, load gradient, terrain, etc. The control system should be responsive to<br>
the driver's throttle input to accurately and smoothly accommodate changes in torque<br>
commands. Fig. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates torque controller methodology using<br>
feedforward compensation expressions that take into account sensed motor operation<br>
conditions as well as individual circuit parameter values to obtain these objectives. For<br>
precision torque tracking, the per-phase desired current trajectories are selected according to<br>
the following expression:<br><br>
where la denotes per-phase desired current trajectory, td denotes the user's requested torque<br>
command, W, represents the total number of phase windings, Kn denotes a per-phase torque<br>
transmission coefficient and ?i represents relative positional displacement between the <br>
phase winding and a rotor reference point. The per-phase current magnitude is dependent on<br>
the per-phase value of the torque transmission coefficient Kn.<br>
In older to develop the desired phase currents the following per-phase voltage control<br>
expression is applied to the driver for the phase windings:<br><br>
Fig. 5 represents the methodology, generally indicated by reference numeral 60, by which the<br>
controller derives the components of this voltage control expression in real time, utilizing the<br>
torque command input and the signals received from phase current sensors, position sensor<br>
and speed detector. The external user requested (desired) torque command td(t), responsive<br>
to the throttle, is input to controller function block 62 and rotor position 9 is input to<br>
controller function block 64. Block 64 produces an output representing excitation angle ?1<br>
(t) based on the rotor position, the number of permanent magnet pole pairs (Nr) the number of<br>
stator phases (Ns), and the phase delay of the particular phase. The output of controller<br>
function block 64 is fed to controller function block 62. Using the excitation angle input thus<br>
received, controller function block 62 determines, in accordance with the expression set forth<br>
above, how phase currents are distributed among the Ns phases such that the user requested<br>
torque td (t) is developed by the motor. Controller function block 66 calculates the difference<br>
between the desired phase current Idi (t) received from block 62 and me sensed phase current<br>
Ii (t) to output a phase current track error signal ei (t). This error signal is multiplied by gain<br>
factor ks in controller function block 68. The effect of the current feedback gain is to increase<br>
overall system robustness via the rejection of system disturbances due to measurement noise<br>
and any model parameter inaccuracies. The output of block 68 is fed to controller function<br>
block 70. Block 70 outputs time varying voltage signals Vi (t) to the gate drivers 52 for the<br>
selective controlled energization of me phase windings 34. Vi (t) has components that<br>
compensate for the effects of inductance, induced back-emf and resistance.<br>
To compensate for the presence of inductance within phase windings, the term<br>
Ldldi/dt, wherein dldi/dt denotes the standard time derivative of the desired phase current Idi<br>
(t), is input to the controller function block 70 to be added in the phase voltage calculation.<br>
Determination of Ldldi/dt, is made at controller function block 72, acting upon the received<br>
inputs of td(t), ?1 (t) and ? (t). To compensate for the induced back-emf voltage the term<br>
Ei is added in the phase voltage calculation as an input to function block 70 from controller<br>
function block 74. The back-emf compensation value is derived from the excitation angle<br>
and speed, received as inputs to block 74 using back-emf coefficient Kei. To compensate for<br>
voltage drop attributed to phase winding resistance and parasitic resistance, the term Ri Ii(t) is<br>
added in the phase voltage calculation as an input to function block 70 from controller<br>
function block 76.<br>
In operation, controller 44 successively outputs control signals Vi (t) to the gate<br>
drivers for individual energization of respective phase windings. The gate drivers activate the<br>
respective switch sets so that the sequence in which windings are selected comports with a<br>
sequence established in the controller. The sequence is transmitted to the gate drivers through<br>
me link only generally illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 5. Each successive control signal V/<br>
(t) is related to the particular current sensed in me corresponding phase winding, the<br>
immediately sensed rotor position and speed, and also to model parameters, Kei and Kei, that<br>
have been predetermined specifically for the respective phases. Thus, for each derived<br>
control signal Vi (t), in addition to receiving timely sensed motor feedback signals, the<br>
controller must access the parameters specific to the particular phase to which the control<br>
signal corresponds. The controller thus has the ability to compensate for individual phase<br>
characteristic differences among the various stator phases. To prevent over/under<br>
compensation of the voltage control routine, the per-phase circuit parameters utilized are<br>
exactly matched to their actual phases values.<br>
The per-phase torque transmission coefficient Kn captures the per-phase torque<br>
contribution of each phase. This parameter is proportional to the ratio of the effective torque<br>
generated per current applied for that phase. The torque developed by the phase is a function<br>
of the magnetic flux density developed in the core material of the phase, which produces the<br>
effective air gap flux density. The design of the electromagnetic core geometry takes into<br>
account current density, which is a function of the ampere-turns on each portion of the core in<br>
order to optimize induction in the material without driving the core into saturation. However,<br>
the magnetic properties of the core material are often non-homogeneous throughout the stator<br>
core. If the motor is configured with separated, ferromagnetically autonomous electromagnet<br>
cores, inconsistencies can be even more pronounced. Variations in winding and inductance<br>
also contribute in determining the torque constant and the back-emf coefficient parameters.<br>
There will be degradation in the effective flux buildup in the core if air pockets are formed in<br>
the windings. Although high packing factors can be achieved through uniform winding, there<br>
can be variations in wire manufacturing. Thus, if a nominal motor torque transmission<br>
coefficient and a nominal back-emf coefficient are utilized by the controller, the variation in<br>
properties of the phases produces overall motor output torque ripple. The torque controller<br>
methodology represented in Fig. 5 avoids this problem by applying the per-phase torque<br>
transmission coefficient and back-emf coefficients predetermined for each phase.<br>
The computations illustrated in Fig. 5 are performed successively in real time. The<br>
expression shown in block 62 has been selected to provide the desired currents for tracking<br>
torque in the preferred embodiment This expression can be modified if factors other than<br>
precisely tracking changes in torque input commands are also of significance. For example,<br>
in some vehicle environments, degree of acceleration and deceleration may be of<br>
consideration to avoid unnecessarily rough driving conditions. The expression in block 62<br>
thus can be changed to accommodate additional considerations.<br>
The controller methodology illustrated in Fig. 5 may be performed in an integrated<br>
execution scheme in which particular phase parameters are substituted for each generated<br>
control voltage output Alternatively, the controller 44 may provide a separate control loop<br>
for each stator phase n, as represented in the partial block diagram of Fig. 6. For each of the<br>
N, motor phases, a corresponding control loop 60/ is provided. Each loop contains die<br>
relevant parameters for the respective motor phase. The control loops are activated in<br>
accordance with the appropriate motor phase energization sequence and need only the sensed<br>
motor feedback signals for generation of the control voltages.<br>
In this disclosure there is shown and described only preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention and but a few examples of its versatility. It is to be understood that the invention is<br>
capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or<br>
modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. For example, in<br>
the control methodology illustrated in Fig. 5, the desired per-phase current ldi (t) can be<br>
determined in real time from the received inputs of td (t), ?i (t) by reference to values stored<br>
in look-up tables. Look-up tables would be provided for each stator phase.<br>
As can be appreciated, the motor of the invention can be utilized in a wide range of<br>
applications in addition to vehicle drives. While it is preferred, in the implementation of a<br>
vehicle drive, that the rotor surround the stator, other applications may find advantageous utility<br>
with the stator surrounding the rotor. Thus, it is within the contemplation of the invention that<br>
each inner and outer annular member may comprise either the stator or rotor and may comprise<br>
either the group of electromagnets or group of permanent magnets.<br>
