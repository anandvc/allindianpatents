A DOUBLE LOCKING PADLOCK WITH RESTRICTED KEYWAYS<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 4 00 07 9 MAHARASHTRA, India, a INDIAN National Company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a Double locking Padlock with restricted keyways. More particularly the invention relates to a locking mechanism with added security which locks the shackle at both the ends in its locking position thereby making it difficult for pry-opening by jimmying or similar device.<br>
In conventional Double Locking Padlocks there are two independent laterally sliding locking bolts, which engages in the slots provided on both ends of the shackle. If excessive force is applied on the shackle in locked condition of the padlock, a possibility exists for these bolts to slide backward and deflect a little so as to allow the shackle to come out, this type of conventional double locking mechanism is insecure. Therefore there is a need to provide more secure double locking Padlocks.<br>
The principle object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which is more secure than the conventional locks. Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which provides a rotating driving cam snugly fitted inside the solid brass body of the padlock, holding the two locking bolts securely, so as to keep the shackle in its locked position.<br>
The other object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways for further security wherein the entry of keys itself is restricted.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which increase number of non inter changeable key combinations which is directly proportional to the different number of keyways that can be generated using longitudinal projections in the cylinder.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways   with   reversible key insertion facility.<br><br><br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which will only allow the matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other keys.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways with drain hole at the bottom of the padlock at both sides of shackle so as to drain the liquid or rain water for better working of the shackle which will prevent water logging therefore will not affect the smooth working of the lock.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways and provide antispark material for the manufacture of the lock which will be useful for the inflammable material in tankers thus preventing the risk of accident.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which cannot be opened without  its original key.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways where the key cannot be removed from Padlock until the shackle is firmly   locked.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways  with changeable core.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted   keyways with master key facility.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide an improved padlock with restricted keyways wherein the special curvature at the mouth of the cylinder and key provides self alignment and easy reversible entry of the key into the lock.<br><br><br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a double locking padlock with restricted keyways where the shackle can be locked only in one position matching with the hole as the body there by ensuring full proof locking.<br>
A Double Locking Padlock with Restricted Keyways consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) and at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin (6) for arresting during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) having at least one longitudinal projections (20) to allow only matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other key; surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) sealable by cap (23) from outside; said cylinder (7) having plurality of inside grooves (22) wherever spring loaded pairs of pins are located whereby the key member (11) having longitudinal grooves (21) matching with projections (22) on cylinder (7) &amp; having multiplicity of indentation (12) with mirror image on both side and edges thereby mating &amp; reversibly operable with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder (7) in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing (8); a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle to lock firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle is pulled out; two drain holes (19) are provided at the bottom of the shackle holes to prevent water logging and not affect the smooth working of the locks.<br><br><br>
The invention will now be clear from the following description of figure 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 : is   a  exploded    view   of  a   Double Locking Padlock  with    Restricted keyways.<br>
Figure 2 : is   a   sectional   view   of  a Double   Locking   Padlock  with   Restricted keyways.<br>
Figure 3 : is    a   isometric   view of  a   Double Locking Padlock  with   Restricted keyways in its   locking position.<br>
Figure 4 : is   a   isometric   view   of  a Double Locking   Padlock  with Restricted keyways in  its unlocking   position.<br>
Referring to Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 the inventor has invented a Double Locking Padlock with restricted Keyways which is herein described with reference to the accompanying Drawings.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a Double Locking padlock with restricted keyways consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) and at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin (6) for arresting during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) having at least, one longitudinal projection (20) to allow only matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other key; surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) sealable by cap (23) from outside; said cylinder having plurality of inside grooves (22) wherever spring loaded pairs of   pins are located whereby the key member (11)<br><br><br>
having longitudinal grooves (21) matching with projections (22) on cylinder (7) &amp; having multiplicity of indentation (12) with mirror image on both side and edges, thereby mating &amp; reversibly operable with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing (8); a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle for locking firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle is pulled out; two drain holes (19) are provided at the bottom of the shackle holes to prevent water logging and not affect the smooth working of the locks.<br>
A locking mechanism with added security. In particular, in this Padlock, having a solid brass body construction, the Shackle is secured in its locked position from both ends, which makes it difficult to pry-open by jimmying or similar device. In conventional Double Locking Padlocks there are two independent laterally sliding locking bolts, which engages in the slots provided on both ends of the shackle. If excessive force is applied on the shackle in locked condition of the padlock, a possibility exists for these bolts to slide backward and deflect a little so as to allow the shackle to come out, this type of conventional double locking mechanism is insecure. Therefore there is need to provide more secure double locking Padlocks. However in this invention is being referred to, a rotating driving cam which snugly fits inside the solid brass body of the padlocks holding the two locking bolts securely, so as to keep the shackle in its locked position.<br>
Since the two locking bolts are held by the driving cam at two diametrically opposite ends, the forces coming on these locking bolts, in the event of any attempt made to force open the shackle, would effectively be nullified, thus preventing any undue deflection or damage to the driving cam.<br><br><br>
These double locking brass padlocks could be made in other sizes and by using "Ultra Locking System" of Godrej, which is being patented or any other equivalent locking systems. The Locking System can also be incorporated with Master Key System.<br>
Construction:<br>
The Lock Body, Driving Cam, Cam, Sleeve, Cylinder, Cylinder Housing, Pins etc, are made of Brass. The shackle could be made of either Brass or Steel depending on user requirement. The two Locking Bolts are made of steel or stainless steel for added strength. The keys can be made of either Nickel- Silver or Brass depending on type of key. The Keys can also be provided with plastic Key- Head if needed.<br>
Assembly<br>
The assembly of cylinder with restricted keyway and cylinder housing is prepared separately based on its specific key combination (this lock can also be provided with Master key system of Godrej as per specific customer needs). The cylinder Housing assembly is housed in a Sleeve. The cam is/are securely placed at the end of the cylinder assembly.<br>
The two locking bolts are inserted in their respective holes in the Lock body and then the Shackle is inserted and locked in position. The Driving cam is then placed properly inside the recess provided inside the lock body, so as to hold the locking bolts at two ends of the Driving cam. The cylinder assembly is then inserted inside the lock body and it is held in its position by a cylinder housing locking screw which is fitted through a small hole on the side of the lock body. This hole is subsequently sealed by a brass cap which is press fitted and ground flush, so as to   hide the hole on  lock body.<br><br><br>
WE   CLAIM:<br>
1. A Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) and at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin (6) for arresting during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) having at least one longitudinal projections (20) to allow only matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other key; surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) sealable by cap (23) from outside; said cylinder (7) having plurality of inside grooves (22) wherever spring loaded pairs of pins are located whereby the key member (11) having longitudinal grooves (21) matching with projections (22) on cylinder (7) &amp; having multiplicity of indentation (12) with mirror image on both side and edges thereby mating &amp; reversibly operable with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder (7) in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing (8); a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle to lock firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle is pulled out; two drain holes (19) are provided at the bottom of the shackle holes to prevent water logging and not affect the smooth working of the locks.<br>
