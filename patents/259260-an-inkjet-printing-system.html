AN INKJET PRINTING SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to inkjet printing devices, and more particularly to an<br>
inkjet printing device that includes a printhead portion that receives drop activation<br>
signals for selectively ejecting ink.<br>
Inkjet printing systems frequently make use of an inkjet printhead mounted to<br>
a carriage which is moved back and forth across print media such as paper. As the<br>
printhead is moved across the print media, a control device selectively activates each<br>
of a plurality of drop generators within the printhead to eject or deposit ink droplets<br>
onto the print media to form images and text characters. An ink supply that is either<br>
carried with the printhead or remote from the printhead provides ink for replenishing<br>
the plurality of drop generators.<br>
Individual drop generators are selectively activated by the use of an activation<br>
signal that is provided by the printing system to the printhead. In the case of thermal<br>
inkjet printing, each drop generator is activated by passing an electric current through<br>
a resistive element such as a resistor. In response to the electric current the resistor<br>
produces heat, that in turn, heats ink in a vaporization chamber adjacent the resistor.<br>
Once the ink reaches vaporization, a rapidly expanding vapor front forces ink within<br>
the vaporization chamber through an adjacent orifice or nozzle. Ink droplets ejected<br>
from the nozzles are deposited on print media to accomplish printing.<br>
The electric current is frequently provided to individual resistors or drop<br>
generators by a switching device such as a field effect transistor (FET). The<br>
switching device is activated by a control signal that is provided to the control<br>
terminal of the switching device. Once activated the switching device enables the<br>
electric current to pass to the selected resistor. The electric current or drive current<br>
provided to each resistor is sometimes referred to as a drive current signal. The<br>
control signal for selectively activating the switching device associated with each<br>
resistor is sometimes referred to as an address signal.<br>
In one previously used arrangement, a switching transistor is connected in<br>
series with each resistor. When active, the switching transistor allows a drive current<br><br>
to pass through each of the resistor and switching transistor. The resistor and<br>
switching transistor together form a drop generator. A plurality of these drop<br>
generators are then arranged in a logical two-dimensional array of drop generators<br>
having rows and columns. Each column of drop generators in the array are connected<br>
to a different source of drive current and with each drop generator within each column<br>
connected in a parallel connection between the source of drive current for mat<br>
column. Each row of drop generators within the array is connected to a different<br>
address signal with each drop generator within each row connected to a common<br>
source of address signals for that row of drop generators. In this manner, any<br>
individual drop generator within the two-dimensional array of drop generators can be<br>
individually activated by activating the address signal corresponding to the drop<br>
generator of row and providing drive current from the source of drive current<br>
associated with the drop generator column. In this manner, the number of electrical<br>
interconnects required for the printhead is greatly reduced over providing drive and<br>
control signals for each individual drop generator associated with the printhead.<br>
While the row and column addressing scheme previously discussed is capable<br>
of being implemented in relatively simple and relatively inexpensive technology<br>
tending to reduce printhead manufacturing costs, this technique suffers from the<br>
disadvantage of requiring relatively large number of bond pads for printheads having<br>
large numbers of drop generators. For printheads having in excess of three hundred<br>
drop generators, a number of bond pads tends to become a limiting factor when<br>
attempting to minimize the die size.<br>
Another technique that has been previously been used makes use of<br>
transferring activation information to the printhead in a serial format. This drop<br>
generator activation information is rearranged using shift registers so that the proper<br>
drop generators can be activated. This technique, while greatly reducing the number<br>
of electrical interconnects, tends to require various logic functions as well as static<br>
memory elements. Printheads having various logic functions and memory elements<br>
require suitable technologies such as CMOS technology and tend to require a constant<br>
power supply. Printheads formed using CMOS technology, which tend to be more<br>
costly to manufacturer than printheads using NMOS technology. The CMOS<br><br>
manufacturing process is a more complex manufacturing process than the NMOS<br>
manufacturing process that requires more masking steps that tend to increase the costs<br>
of the printhead. In addition, the requirement of a constant power supply tends to<br>
increase the cost of the printing device that must supply this constant power supply<br>
voltage to the printhead.<br>
There is an ever present need for inkjet printheads that have fewer electrical<br>
interconnects between the printhead and the printing device thereby tending to reduce<br>
the overall costs of the printing system as well as the printhead itself. These<br>
printheads should be capable of being manufactured using a relatively inexpensive<br>
manufacturing technology that allows the printheads to be manufactured using high<br>
volume manufacturing techniques and have relatively low manufacturing costs.<br>
These printheads should allow information to be transferred between the printing<br>
device and the printhead in a reliable manner thereby allowing high print quality as<br>
well as reliable operation. Finally, these printheads should be capable of supporting<br>
large numbers of drop generators to provide printing systems mat are capable of<br>
providing high print rates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention is an inkjet printing system that includes<br>
an inkjet printhead having a plurality of electrical contacts. The plurality of electrical<br>
contacts include address contacts and enable contacts for enabling drop generators<br>
and drive current contacts for providing drive current to enable drop generators for<br>
selectively ejecting ink therefrom. The printing system includes a printing device<br>
having a plurality of electrical contacts including address contacts, enable contacts<br>
and drive current contacts. The plurality of electrical contacts are configured to<br>
establish electrical contact with corresponding electrical contacts on the inkjet<br>
printhead upon insertion of the inkjet printhead into the printing device. The printing<br>
device provides periodic address signals and enable signals to the address and enable<br>
contacts one the printhead. In addition, the printing device selectively applies drive<br>
current to accomplish forming images on print media.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is an inkjet printhead responsive to<br>
enable and drive current signals for dispensing ink. The inkjet printhead includes an<br><br>
energy storage device for storing energy. Also included is an energy charging device<br>
responsive to a first enable signal for storing energy in the energy storage device. The<br>
inkjet printhead further includes an energy discharging device responsive to a second<br>
enable signal for discharging energy in the energy storage device. A drop generating<br>
device is included for dispensing ink from the inkjet printhead upon activation. The<br>
drop generating device is activated by a drive current signal active and energy stored<br>
in the energy storage device being greater than a threshold energy level.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is an inkjet printhead having a<br>
plurality of drop generators with each drop generator of the plurality of drop<br>
generators responsive to an activation signal and a drive current for selectively<br>
dispensing ink therefrom. The inkjet printhead includes a plurality of groups of drop<br>
generators for depositing ink on media. Each of the plurality of groups of drop<br>
generators are capable of activation once over a printhead activation cycle. The<br>
printhead activation cycle is subdivided into a plurality of timeslots with each of the<br>
plurality of groups of drop generators having a corresponding timeslot associated<br>
therewith. The activation signal is active in the corresponding timeslot before drive<br>
current is provided. In addition, the activation signal is active for a duration that is<br>
less than a duration drive current is provided. Each drop generator within each group<br>
of drop generators is configured so that when activated the drop generator is active for<br>
the duration that drive current is provided,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of one exemplary embodiment of an inkjet<br>
printing system 10 of the present invention shown with its cover open. The inkjet<br>
printing system 10 includes a printer portion 12 having at least one print cartridge 14<br>
and 16 installed in a scanning carriage 18. The printing portion 12 includes a media<br>
tray 20 for receiving media 22. As the print media 22 is stepped through a print zone,<br>
the scanning carriage 18 moves the print cartridges 14 and 16 across the print media.<br>
The printer portion 12 selectively activates drop generators within a printhead portion<br>
(not shown) associated with each of the print cartridges 14 and 16 to deposit ink on<br>
the print media to thereby accomplish printing.<br>
An important aspect of the present invention is a method for which the printer<br>
portion 12 transfers drop generator activation information to the print cartridges 14<br>
and 16. This drop generator activation information is used by the printhead portion to<br>
activate drop generators as the print cartridges 14 and 16 are moved relative to the<br>
print media. Another aspect of the present invention is the printhead portion that<br>
makes use of the information provided by the printer portion 12. The method and<br>
apparatus of me present invention allows information to be passed between the printer<br><br>
portion 12 and the printhead with relatively few interconnects thereby tending to<br>
reduce the size of the printhead. In addition the method and apparatus of the present<br>
invention allows the printhead to be implemented without requiring clocked storage<br>
elements or complex logic functions thereby reducing the manufacturing costs of the<br>
printhead. The method and apparatus of the present invention will be discussed in<br>
more detail with respect to Figs. 3-11.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts a bottom perspective view of one preferred embodiment of the<br>
print cartridge 14 shown in Fig. 1. In the preferred embodiment, the cartridge 14 is a<br>
3 color cartridge containing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, a separate print cartridge 16 is provided for black ink. The present<br>
invention will herein be described with respect to this preferred embodiment by way<br>
of example only. There are numerous other configurations in which the method and<br>
apparatus of the present invention is also suitable. For example, the present invention<br>
is also suited to configurations wherein the printing system contains separate print<br>
cartridges for each color of ink used in printing. Alternatively, the present invention<br>
is applicable to printing systems wherein more than 4 ink colors are used such as in<br>
high-fidelity printing wherein 6 or more ink colors are used. Finally, the present<br>
invention is applicable to various types of print cartridges such as print cartridges<br>
which include an ink reservoir as shown in Fig. 2, or for print cartridges which are<br>
replenished with ink from a remote source of ink, either continuously or<br>
intermittently.<br>
The ink cartridge 14 shown in Fig. 2 includes a printhead portion 24 that is<br>
responsive to activation signals from the printing system 12 for selectively depositing<br>
ink on media 22. In the preferred embodiment, the printhead 24 is defined on a<br>
substrate such as silicon. The printhead 24 is mounted to a cartridge body 25. The<br>
print cartridge 14 includes a plurality of electrical contacts 26 that are disposed and<br>
arranged on the cartridge body 25 so that when properly inserted into the scanning<br>
carriage, electrical contact is established between corresponding electrical contacts<br>
(not shown) associated with the printer portion 12. Each of the electrical contacts 26<br>
is electrically connected to the printhead 24 by each of a plurality of electrical<br><br>
conductors (not shown). In this manner, activation signals from the printer portion 12<br>
are provided to the inkjet printhead 24.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the electrical contacts 26 are defined in a<br>
flexible circuit 28. The flexible circuit 28 includes an insulating material such as<br>
polyimide and a conductive material such as copper. Conductors are defined within<br>
the flexible circuit to electrically connect each of the electrical contacts 26 to<br>
electrical contacts defined on the printhead 24. The printhead 24 is mounted and<br>
electrically connected to the flexible circuit 28 using a suitable technique such as tape<br>
automated bonding (TAB).<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the print cartridge is a 3 color<br>
cartridge containing yellow, magenta, and cyan inks within a corresponding reservoir<br>
portion. The printhead 24 includes drop ejection portions 30, 32 and 34 for ejecting<br>
ink corresponding, respectively, to yellow, magenta, and cyan inks. The electrical<br>
contacts 26 include electrical contacts associated with activation signals for each of<br>
the yellow, magenta, and cyan drop generators 30,32, 34, respectively.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the black ink cartridge 16 shown in Fig. 1 is<br>
similar to the color cartridge 14 shown in Fig- 2 except the black cartridge makes use<br>
of two drop ejection portions instead of three shown on the color cartridge 14. The<br>
method and apparatus of the present invention will be discussed herein with respect to<br>
the black cartridge 16. However, the method and apparatus of the present invention is<br>
applicable to the color cartridge 14 as well.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a simplified electrical block diagram of the printer portion 12<br>
and one of the print cartridges 16. The printer portion 12 includes a print control<br>
device 36, a media transport device 38 and a carriage transport device 40. The print<br>
control device 36 provides control signals to the media transport device 38 to pass the<br>
media 22 through a print zone whereupon ink is deposited on the print media 22. In<br>
addition, the print control device 36 provides control signals for selectively moving <br>
the scanning carriage 18 across the media 22, thereby defining a print zone. As the<br>
media 22 is stepped past the printhead 24 or through the print zone the scanning<br>
carriage 18 is scanned across the print media 22. While the printhead 24 is scanned<br>
the print control device 36 provides activation signals to the printhead 24 to<br><br>
selectively deposit ink on print media to accomplish printing. Although, the printing<br>
system 10 is described herein as having the printhead 24 disposed in a scanning<br>
carriage there are other printing system 10 arrangements as well. These other<br>
arrangements involve other arrangements of achieving relative movement between the<br>
printhead and media such as having a fixed printhead portion and moving the media<br>
past the printhead or having fixed media and moving the printhead past the fixed<br>
media.<br>
Fig. 3 is simplified to show only a single print cartridge 16. In general, the<br>
print control device 36 is electrically connected to each of the print cartridges 14 and<br>
16. The print control device 36 provides activation signals to selectively deposit ink<br>
corresponding to each of the ink colors to be printed.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a simplified electrical block diagram showing greater detail of<br>
the print control device 36 within the printer portion 12. and the printhead 24 within<br>
the print cartridge 16. The print control device 36 includes a source of drive current,<br>
an address generator, and an enable generator. The source of drive current, address<br>
generator and enable generator provide drive current, address and enable signals<br>
under control of the control device or controller 36 to the printhead 24 for selectively<br>
activating each of a plurality of drop generators associated therewith.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the source of drive current provides 16 separate<br>
drive current signals designated P (1-16). Each drive current signal provides<br>
sufficient energy per unit time to activate the drop generator to eject ink. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the address generator provides 13 separate address signals<br>
designated A (1-13) for selecting a group of drop generators. In this preferred<br>
embodiment the address signals are logic signals. Finally, in the preferred<br>
embodiment, the enable generator provides 2 enable signals designated E (1-2) for<br>
selecting a subgroup of drop generators from the selected group of drop generators.<br>
The selected subgroup of drop generators are activated if drive current provided by<br>
the source of drive current is supplied. Further detail of the drive signals, address<br>
signals and enable signals will be discussed with respect to Figs. 9-11.<br>
The printhead 24 shown in Fig. 4 includes a plurality of groups of drop<br>
generators with each group of drop generators connected to a different source of drive<br><br>
current In the preferred embodiment, the printhead 24 includes 16 groups of drop<br>
generators. The first group of drop generators is connected to the source of drive<br>
current labeled P(l), the second group of drop generators are each connected to the<br>
source of drive current designated P(2), the third group of drop generators is<br>
connected to the source of drive current designated P(3), and so on with the sixteenth<br>
group of drop generators each connected to the source of drive current designated<br>
P(16).<br>
Each of the groups of drop generators shown in Fig. 4 are connected to each of<br>
the address signals designated A(l-13) provided by the address generator on the print<br>
control device 36. In addition, each of the groups of drop generators are connected to<br>
the two enable, signals designated E(l-2) provided by the address generator on the<br>
print control device 36. Greater detail of each of the individual groups of drop<br>
generators designated will now be discussed with respect to Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram representing a single group of drop generators from<br>
the plurality of groups of drop generators shown in Fig. 4. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the single group of drop generators shown in Fig. 5 is a group of 26<br>
individual drop generators each connected to a common source of drive current The<br>
group of drop generators shown in Fig. 5 are all connected to the common source of<br>
drive current designated P(l) of Fig. 4.<br>
The individual drop generators within the group of drop generators are<br>
organized in drop generator pairs with each pair of drop generators connected to a<br>
different source of address signals. For the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the first pair<br>
of drop generators are connected to a source of address signals designated A(l), the<br>
second pair of drop generators are connected to a second source of address signals<br>
designated A(2), the third pair of drop generators are connected to a source of address<br>
signals designated A(3) and so on with the thirteenth pair of drop generators<br>
connected to the thirteenth source of address signals designated A(13).<br>
Each of the 26 individual drop generators shown in Fig. 5 are also connected<br>
to the source of enable signals. In the preferred embodiment, the source of enable<br>
signals is a pair of enable signals designated E(l-2).<br><br>
The remaining groups of drop generators shown in Fig. 4 that are connected to<br>
the remaining sources of drive current designated P(2) through P( 16) are connected in<br>
a manner similar to the first group of drop generators shown in Fig. 5. Each of the<br>
remaining groups of drop generators are connected to a different source of drive<br>
current as designated in Fig. 4 instead of the source of drop current P(l) shown in<br>
Fig. 5. Greater detail of each individual drop generator shown in Fig. 5 will now be<br>
discussed with respect to Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 6 shows one preferred embodiment of an individual drop generator<br>
designated 42. The drop generator 42 represents one individual drop generator shown<br>
in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5 two individual drop generators 42 make up a pair of<br>
drop generators 42 that are each connected to a common source of address signals.<br>
The individual drop generator shown in Fig. 6 represents one of the pair of drop<br>
generators 42 connected to address source 1 designated A(l) of Fig. 5. All sources of<br>
signals such as address signals A(l) and enable signals E(I-2) discussed with respect<br>
to Figs. 6 and 7 are signals that are provided between the corresponding source of<br>
signals and the common reference point 46. In addition, the source of drive current is<br>
provided between the corresponding source of drive current designated P(l) and the <br>
common reference point 46.<br>
The drop generator 42 includes a heating element 44 connected between the <br>
source of drive current. For the particular drop generator 42 shown in Fig. 6 the <br>
source of drive current is designated P(l). The heating element 44 is connected in<br>
series with a switching device 48 between the source of drive current P(1) and the <br>
common reference point 46. The switching device 48 includes a pair of controlled<br>
terminals connected between the heating element 44 and the common reference point<br>
46. Also included with the switching device 48 is a control terminal for controlling<br>
the controlled terminals. The switching device 48 is responsive to activation signals<br>
at the control terminal for selectively allowing current to pass between the pair of<br>
controlled terminals. In this manner, activation of the control terminals allows drive<br>
current from the source of drive current designated P(l) to pass through the heating<br>
element 44 thereby producing heat energy that is sufficient to eject ink from the<br>
printhead 24.<br><br>
In one preferred embodiment, the heating element 44 is a resistive heating<br>
element and the switching device 48 is a field effect transistor (FET) such as an<br>
NMOS transistor.<br>
The drop generator 42 further includes a second switching device SO and a<br>
third switching device 52 for controlling activation of the control terminal of the<br>
switching device 48. The second switching device has a pair of controlled terminals<br>
connected between a source of address signals and the control terminal of switching<br>
device 48. The third switching device 52 is connected between the control terminal of<br>
switching device 48 and the common reference point 46. Each of the second and<br>
third switching devices SO and 52, respectively, selectively control the activation of<br>
the switching device 48.<br>
The activation of switching device 48 is based on each of the address signal<br>
and enable signal. For the particular drop generator 42 shown in Fig. 6 the address<br>
signal is represented by A(l), the first enable signal represented by E(l) and a second<br>
enable signal represented by E(2). The first enable signal E(l) is connected to the<br>
control terminal of the second switching device 50. The second enable signal<br>
represented by E(2) is connected to the control terminal of the third switching device<br>
52. By controlling the first and second enable signals, E(l-2), and the address signal,<br>
A(l), the switching device 48 is selectively activated to conduct current through the<br>
heating element 44 if drive current is present from the source of drive source P(l).<br>
Similarly, the switching device 48 is inactivated to prevent current from being<br>
conducted through the heating resistor 44 even if the source of drive current P(l) is<br>
active.<br>
The switching device 48 is activated by the activation of the second switching<br>
device 50 and the presence of an active address signal at the source of address signals,<br>
A( I). In the preferred embodiment where the second switching device is a field effect<br>
transistor (FET) the controlled terminals associated with the second switching device<br>
are source and drain terminals. The drain terminal is connected to the source of<br>
address signals A( 1) and the source terminal is connected to the controlled terminal of<br>
the first switching device 48. The control terminal for the FET transistor switching<br>
device 50 is a gate terminal. When the gate terminal, connected to the first enable<br><br>
signal E(l), is sufficiently positive relative to the source terminal and the source of<br>
address signals, A(l), provides a voltage at the drain terminal that is greater than the<br>
voltage at the source terminal then the second switching device SO is activated.<br>
The second switching device, if active, provides current from the source of<br>
address signals A(l) to the control terminal or gate of the switching device 48. This<br>
current, if sufficient, activates the switching device 48. The switching device 48, in<br>
the preferred embodiment, is a FET transistor having a drain and source as the<br>
controlled terminals with the drain connected to the heating element 44 and the source<br>
connected to the common reference terminal 46.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the switching device 48 has a gate capacitance<br>
between the gate and source terminals. Because this switching device 48 is relatively<br>
large to conduct relatively large currents through the heating device 44, then the gate<br>
to source capacitance associated with the switching device 48 tends to be relatively<br>
large. Therefore, to enable or activate the switching device 48, the gate or control<br>
terminal must be charged sufficiently so that the switching device 48 is activated to<br>
conduct between the source and drain. The control terminal is charged by the source<br>
of address signals A(l) if the second switching device 50 is active. The source of<br>
address signals A(l) provides current to charge the gate to source capacitance of the<br>
switching device 48. It is important that the third switching 52 be inactive when the<br>
switching device 48 is active to prevent a low resistance path from being formed<br>
between the source of address signals A(1) and the common reference terminal 46.<br>
Therefore, the enable signal E(2) is inactive while the switching device 48 is active or<br>
conducting.<br>
The switching device 48 is inactivated by activating the third switching device<br>
52 to reduce the gate to source voltage sufficiently to inactivate me switching device<br>
48. The third switching device 52 in the preferred embodiment is a FET transistor<br>
having drain and source as the controlled terminals with the drain connected to the <br>
control terminal of switching device 48. The control terminal is a gate terminal that is<br>
connected to the second source of enable signals E(2). The third switching device 52<br>
is activated by activation of the second enable signal E(2) that provides a voltage at<br>
the gate that is sufficiently large relative to a voltage at the source of the third<br><br>
switching device 52. Activation of the third switching device 52 causes the controlled<br>
terminals or drain and source terminals to conduct thereby reducing a voltage between<br>
the control terminal or gate terminal of the switching device 48 and the source<br>
terminal of the switching device 48. By sufficiently reducing the voltage between the<br>
gate terminal and the source terminal of the switching device 48 the switching device<br>
48 is prevented from being partially turned on by capacitive coupling.<br>
While the third switching device 52 is active, the second switching 50 is<br>
inactive to prevent sinking large amounts of current from the source of address<br>
signals, A(l), to the common reference terminal 46. The operation of the individual<br>
drop generator 42 will be discussed in more detail with respect to the timing diagrams<br>
shown in Figs, 8 through 11.<br>
Fig. 7 shows greater detail of a pair of drop generators that are formed by the<br>
drop generator designated 42 and a drop generator designated 42'. Each of the drop<br>
generators 42 and 42' that form the pair of drop generators are identical to the drop<br>
generator 42 discussed previously with respect to Fig. 6. The pair of drop generators<br>
are each connected to a source of address signals represented by A(l) shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Each of the drop generators 42 and 42' are connected to a common source of drive<br>
current P(l) and common source of address signals A(l). However, the first and<br>
second enable signals E(l) and E(2), respectively, are connected differently in drop<br>
generator 42' from drop generator 42. In drop generator 42', the first enable signal<br>
E(l) is connected to the gate or control terminal of the third switching device 52' in<br>
contrast to drop generator 42 in which the first enable signal E(l) is connected to the<br>
gate or control terminal of the second switching device 50. Similarly, the second<br>
enable signal E(2) is connected to the gate or control terminal of the second switching<br>
device 50' in the drop generator 42' in contrast to the drop generator 42 where the<br>
second enable signal E(2) is connected to the gate or control terminal of the third<br>
switching device 52.<br>
The connection of the first and second enable signals E1 and E2 for the pair of<br>
drop generators 42 and 42' ensures that only a single drop generator of the pair of<br>
drop generators will be activated at a given time. As will be discussed later, it is<br>
important that within the group of drop generators that are connected to a common<br><br>
source of drive current that no more than one of these drop generators is active at the<br>
same time. The drop generators that are connected to a common source of drive<br>
current tend to be positioned near each other on the printhead. Therefore, by ensuring<br>
that no more than one of the drop generators that are connected to a common source<br>
of drive current of these is active at me same time tends to prevent fiuidic crosstalk<br>
between these proximately positioned drop generators.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, each of the pairs of drop generators shown in<br>
Fig. 5 are connected in a manner similar to the pair of drop generators shown in Fig.<br>
7. In addition, each of the groups of drop generators connected to a common source<br>
of drive current shown in Fig. 4 are connected in a manner similar to the group of<br>
drop generators shown in Fig. S.<br>
Fig. 8 is a timing diagram illustrating the operation of printhead 24. The<br>
printhead 24 has a cycle time or period of time for each of the drop generators on the<br>
printhead 24 can be activated. This period of time is represented by a time T shown<br>
in Fig. 8. The time T can be divided into 29 intervals of time with each interval<br>
having the same duration. These intervals of time are represented by time slots 1<br>
through 29. Each of the first 26 time slots represents a period in which a group of<br>
drop generators can be activated if the image to be printed so requires. Time slots 27,<br>
28 and 29 represent intervals of time during a printhead cycle in which no drop<br>
generators are activated. The time slots 27,28, and 29 are used by the printing system<br>
10 to perform a variety of functions such as resynchronize the carriage 18 position<br>
and drop generator activation data and transfer activation data from the printer portion<br>
12 to the printhead 24, to name a couple.<br>
The 13 different sources of address signals represented by A(l) through A(13)<br>
are each shown. In addition, each of the first and second enable signals represented<br>
by E(l) and E(2) are also shown. Finally, each of the sources of drive current P (1-<br>
16) are also shown, grouped together. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the address<br>
signals are each activated periodically with the period of activation for each address<br>
signal being equal to the cycle time T of the printhead 24. In addition, no more man<br>
one address signal is active at the same time. Each address signal is active during two<br>
consecutive time slots.<br><br>
Each of the enable signals £(1) and E(2) are periodic signals having a period<br>
that is equal to two time slots. The enable signals E(l) and E(2) each have a duty<br>
cycle that is less than or equal to 50%. Each of the enable signals are out of phase<br>
with each so that only one of enable signal E( 1) or E(2) are active at the same time.<br>
In operation, repeating patterns of address signals provided by each of the 13<br>
sources of address signals A(l-13) are provided to the printhead 24 by the print<br>
control device 36. In addition, repeating patterns of enable signals for the first and<br>
second enable signals, E(l) and E(2), respectively, are also provided by the print<br>
control device 36 to the printhead 24. Both the address and enable signals are<br>
generated independent of the image description or image to be printed. Each of the<br>
16 sources of drive current designated P (1-16) are selectively provided during each<br>
of the 26 time slots for each complete cycle for the inkjet printhead 24. The source of<br>
drive current P(l-16) is selectively applied based on the image description or the<br>
image to be printed. During the first time slot, the sources of drive current P(l-16)<br>
may all be active, none of them active or any number of them active, depending upon <br>
the image to be printed. Similarly, for time slots 2- 26, each of the sources of drive<br>
current P (1-16) are individually selectively activated as required by the print control<br>
device 36 to form the image to be printed.<br>
Fig. 9 is a preferred timing for each of the sources of drive current P (1-16),<br>
sources of address signals A (1-13) and enable signals E (1-2) for the printhead 24 of<br>
the present invention. The timing in Fig. 9 is similar to the timing of Fig. 8 except<br>
that each source of address signals A(l-13) instead of remaining active over the entire<br>
two consecutive time slots shown in Fig. 8, each address is active for only a portion of<br>
each of the two time slots shown in Fig. 9. In this preferred embodiment, each of the<br>
address signals A(l-13) are active at the beginning of each time slot the address signal<br>
is active. In addition, the duty cycle of each of the first and second enable signals<br>
reduced from the nearly 50% duty cycle shown in Fig. 8. Further detail of the timing<br>
of the address enable and drive current will now be discussed with respect to Figs. 10<br>
and 11.<br>
Fig. 10 shows greater detail of time slots 1 and 2 for the timing diagram of<br>
described in Fig. 8. Because the only active address signal during time slot 1 and 2 is<br><br>
A(l) only the address signal A(l) need be shown in Fig 10. As discussed previously,<br>
it is important that the first and second enable signals, E(l) and E(2) respectively, not<br>
be active at the same time to prevent providing a low resistance path to the common<br>
reference point 46 thereby sinking current from the source of address signals A(l-13).<br>
Therefore, the duty cycle of each of the first and second enable signals, £(1) and E(2)<br>
respectively, should be less than 50%. In Fig. 10 the time interval labeled TE between<br>
the transition from active to inactive for the first enable signal E(l) and the transition<br>
from inactive to active for the second enable signal E(2) should be greater than zero.<br>
The enable signal should be active before drive current is provided by the <br>
source of drive current to ensure that the gate of capacitance of the switching<br>
transistor 48 is sufficiently charged to activate the drive transistor 48. The time<br>
interval labeled Ts represents the time between the first enable E(1) active and the <br>
application of the drive current by the sources of drive current P(l-16). A similar<br>
time interval is required for the time between the second enable E(2) active and the <br>
application of the drive current by the sources of drive current P(l-16).<br>
The enable signal E(l) should remain active for a period of time after the <br>
source of drive current P(1-16) transitions from active to inactive as designated TH.<br>
This period of time TH referred to as hold time is sufficient to ensure that drive<br>
current is not present at the switching device 48 when the switching device 48 is<br>
inactivated. Inactivating the switching device 48 while the switching device 48 is<br>
conducting current between the controlled terminals can damage the switching device<br>
48. The hold time TH provides margin to ensure the switching device 48 is not<br>
damaged. The duration of the drive current signal P(l-16) is represented by time<br>
interval labeled TD. The duration of drive current signal P(l-16) is selected to be<br>
sufficient to provide drive energy to the heating element 44 for optimum drop<br>
formation.<br>
Fig. 11 shows further detail of the preferred timing for time slots 1 and 2 for<br>
the timing diagram of Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 11 for time slot 1 the source of<br>
address signals A(l) and the source of enable signals E(l) do not remain active the <br>
entire duration tiiat the source of drive current remains active. Once the gate<br>
capacitance of the switching transistor 48 and 48' shown in Fig.7 is charged, the<br><br>
transistor 48 and 48' remain conducting the remaining duration that the source of<br>
drive current remains active. In this manner, the gate capacitance of the switching<br>
device 48 and 48' acts as a storage device or memory device that retains an activated<br>
state. The switching device 48 and 48* are selected to have sufficient capacitance so<br>
that charge stored within this capacitance remains beyond a threshold amount to keep<br>
the switching device 48 and 48' conducting while the drive current signal is active.<br>
The source of drive signals designated P(l-16) then provides the drive energy that is<br>
necessary for optimum drop formation.<br>
Similar to Fig. 10 the time interval labeled TS represents the time between the<br>
first enable £(1) active and the application of the drive current by the sources of drive<br>
current P(l-16). An interval of time labeled TAH represents a hold time the source of<br>
address signals A(l) must remain active after the first enable signal E(l) is inactive to<br>
ensure the gate capacitance for transistor 48' is in the proper state. If the source of<br>
address signals were to change state before the first enable signal E(l) signal becomes<br>
inactive the wrong state of charge can exist at the gate of transistors 48 and 48'.<br>
Therefore, it is important that the time interval labeled TAH be greater than 0. An<br>
interval of time labeled TEH represents a hold time the second enable signal £(2) must<br>
be active after the source of drive current P(l-16) becomes active. During the time<br>
interval transistor 52 in Fig. 7 is activated by the second enable signal E(2) to<br>
discharge the gate capacitance of transistor 48. If this duration is not sufficiently long<br>
to discharge the gate of transistor 48 the heating element 44 may improperly be<br>
activated or partially activated.<br>
Operation of the inkjet printhead 24 using the preferred timing shown Fig. 11<br>
has important performance advantages over the use of the timing shown in Fig. 10. A<br>
minimum time required for each drop generator 42 activation for the timing shown in<br>
Fig. 10, is equal to the sum of time intervals Ts, TD, TE and TH. In contrast, the timing<br>
shown in Fig. 11 has a minimum time that is required for each drop generator 42<br>
activation that is equal to the sum of time intervals Ts, and TD. Because TD and Ts is<br>
the same for each of the timing diagrams, the minimum time required for activation of<br>
a drop generator 42 is less in Fig. 11 than in Fig. 10. Both the address hold time TAH<br>
and the enable hold time TEH do not contribute to the minimum time interval for drop<br><br>
generator 42 activation in the preferred timing shown in Fig. 11 thereby allowing each<br>
time slot to be a smaller time interval than in Fig. 10. Reduction of the time interval<br>
required for each time slot reduces the cycle period designated T in Figs. 8 and 9<br>
thereby increasing the printing rate for the printhead 24.<br>
The method and apparatus of the present invention allows 416 individual drop<br>
generators to be individually activated using 13 address signals, two enable signals,<br>
and 16 sources of drive current In contrast, the use of previously used techniques<br>
whereby an array of drop generators having 16 columns and 26 rows would require<br>
26 individual addresses to individually select each row with each column being<br>
selected by each source of drive current The present invention provides significantly<br>
fewer electrical interconnects to address the same number of drop generators. The<br>
reduction of electrical interconnects reduces the size of the printhead 24 thereby<br>
significantly reducing the costs of the printhead 24.<br>
Each individual drop generator 42 as shown in Fig. 6 does not require a<br>
constant power supply or bias circuit but instead relies on the input signals such as<br>
address, source of drive current and enable signals to supply power or activate the<br>
drop generator 42. As discussed previously with respect to the timing of the signals,<br>
it is important that these signals be applied in the proper sequence in order to have<br>
proper operation of the drop generator 42. Because the drop generator 42 of the<br>
present invention does not require constant power, the drop generator 42 can be<br>
implemented in relatively simple technology such as NMOS which requires fewer<br>
manufacturing steps men more complex technology such as CMOS. Use of a<br>
technology that has lower manufacturing costs further reduces the costs of the <br>
printhead 24. Finally, the use of fewer electrical interconnects between the printer<br>
portion 36 and the printhead 24 tends to reduce the costs of the printer portion 36 as<br>
well as increase the reliability of the printing system 10.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred<br>
embodiment that makes use of 13 address signals, two enable signals, and 16 sources<br>
of drive current to selectively activate 416 individual drop generators other<br>
arrangements are also contemplated. For example, the present invention is suitable<br>
for selectively activating different numbers of individual drop generators. The<br><br>
selective activation of different numbers of individual nozzles may requite different<br>
numbers of one or more of the address signals, enable signals, and sources of drive<br>
current to properly control different numbers of drop generators. In addition, there<br>
are other arrangements of address signals, enable signals, and sources of drive current<br>
to control the same number of drop generators as well.<br><br>

ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present disclosure relates to an inkjet printing system (10) that includes an inkjet printhead<br>
