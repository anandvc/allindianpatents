Ring-substituted diphenyl azetidinones, method for the production thereof, medicaments containing said compounds, and use thereof<br>
The invention relates to ring-substituted diphenylazetidinones, to their physiologically acceptable salts and to derivatives having physiological functions.<br>
Diphenylazetidinones (such as, for example, ezetimibe) and their use for treating hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have already been described [cf. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(7):679-685) and US 5.756,470].<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide further compounds having a therapeutically utilizable hypolipidemic action. In particular, it was an object to find novel compounds v^'hlch, compared to the compounds described in the prior art, are absorbed to a very low extent. Very low absorption is to be understood as meaning an intestinal absorption of less than 10%, preferably less than or equal to 5%.<br>
In particular, absorption of the novel compounds must be less than that of ezetimibe. Pharmaceutically active compounds which are absorbed to a low extent generally have considerably fewer side-effects.<br><br>

A mono- or dicyclic trialkylammoniumalkyi radical is to be understood as meaning, for example, radicals such as<br><br>
purposes, very particular preference is given to using the chloride salt. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
The scope of the invention also includes salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion, which salts may be useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
Here, the term "derivative having physiological function" refers to any physiologically acceptable derivative of a compound according to the Invention, for example an ester, that Is able, upon administration to a mammal, for example man, to form such a compound or an active metabolite (directly or indirectly).<br>
A further aspect of this invention are prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may or may not be active in their own right.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be present in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. The scope of the invention includes all polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention, which form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Hereinbelow, all references to "compound(s) of the formula (I)" refer to a compound or compounds of the formula {1} as described above, and to their salts, solvates and derivatives having physiological function, as described herein.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives having physiological function are Ideal medicaments for treating an impaired lipid metabolism, in particular hyperiipidemia. The compounds of the<br><br>
formula I are also suitable for modulating the serum cholesterol concentration and for preventing and treating arteriosclerotic manifestations.<br>
The compound(s) of the formula (I) can also be administered in combination with other active compounds.<br>
The amount of a compound of the formula (I) required to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example on the specific compound chosen, on the intended use, on the mode of administration and on the clinical condition of the patient. In general, the daily dose is in the range from 0.1 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.1 mg to 50 mg) per day per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. Tablets or capsules may contain, for example, from 0.01 to 100 mg, typically from 0.02 to 50 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the abovementioned weight data relate to the weight of the diphenyl-azetidlnone-ion derived from the salt. For the prophylaxis or therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used themselves as the compound, but preferably they are present in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and Is not harmful to the health of the patient. The can-ier can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as an individual dose, for example as a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Further pharmaceutically active substances can also be present, including further compounds of the formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist in mixing the constituents with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or auxiliaries.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral or peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration, although the most suitable manner of administration is dependent in each individual case on the nature and severity of<br><br>
the condition to be treated and on the type of the compound of the formula (1) used in each case. Coated formulations and coated delayed-release formulations are also included in the scope of the invention. Acid-resistant and enteric formulations are preferred. Suitable enteric coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyimethylcelluiose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can be present in separate units, such as, for example, capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets, which in each case contain a specific amount of the compound of the formula (1); as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. As already mentioned, these compositions can be prepared according to any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which can consist of one or more additional constituents) are brought into contact. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product, if necessary, is shaped. For example, a tablet can thus be prepared by pressing or shaping a powder or granules of the compound, if appropriate with one or more additional constituents. Pressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, if appropriate mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or a (number of) surface-active/ dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be produced by shaping the pulverulent compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges which contain a compound of the formula (!) with a flavoring, customarily sucrose and gum arable or tragacanth, and pastilles which include the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arable.<br><br>

Using the method described below, the activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention was examined:<br>
Effect on cholesterol absorption + ^H-taurochollc acid excretion using fecal excrement of mice, rats or hamsters<br>
NMRI mice, Wistar rats, or Golden Syrian hamsters (in groups of n=4-6) are kept in metabolic cages, where they are fed with a standard diet (Altromin, Lage (Lippe)). The afternoon prior to the administration of the radioactive tracers (^'*C-cholesterol), the feed Is removed and the animals are adapted to grates.<br>
Additionally, the animals are labeled s.c. with ^H-TCA (taurochollc acid) (for example 1 pCi/mouse up to 5 pCi/rat) 24 hours prior to the peroral administration of the test meal (^'C-cholesterol in Intralipid® 20, Pharmacia-Upjohn).<br>
Cholesterol absorption test: 0.25 ml/mouse Intralipid ©20 (Pharmacia-Upjohn) ((spiked with 0.25 pCI of ^"C-cholesterol in 0.1 mg of cholesterol) is administered perorally by gavage.<br>
Test substances are prepared separately in 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma)/5% Solutol (BASF, Ludvi^igshafen) or a suitable vehicle.<br>
The administration volume of the test substance is 0.5 ml/mouse. The test substance is administered immediately prior to the test meal (Intralipid labeled with ^'C-cholesterol) (cholesterol absorption test).<br>
The feces are collected over a period of 24 h: fecal elimination of ^'C-cholesterol and ^H-taurocholic acid (TCA) is determined after 24 hours.<br>
The livers are removed and homogenized, and aliquots are incinerated in an oximate (Model 307, Packard) to determine the amount of """C-cholesterol which had been taken up/absorbed.<br><br>

As can be seen from the table, the compounds of the formula I have very good cholesterol-lowering action.<br>
Bioabsorption:<br>
The bioabsorption of the compounds of the formula I was examined using the Caco cell model (A.R. Hilgers et al., Caco-2 cell monolayers as a model for drug transport across the intestinal mucosa, Pharm. Res. 1990, 7, 902).<br>
From the measured data, it can be seen that the bioabsorption of the compounds of the formula 1 according to the invention is considerably lower than that of the compounds described in the prior art (reference structure):<br><br><br>
