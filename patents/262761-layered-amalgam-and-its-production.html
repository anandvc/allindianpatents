				<td>Layered Amalgam and Its Production<br>
The present invention relates to a metliod for producing a layered amalgam comprising a metallic<br>
carrier layer and a silicate layer, and the usage of such layered amalgams in heat<br>
pump technology.<br>
Silicates are salt forms of the orthosilicic acids Si(0H)4 and their condensation products. They<br>
are not only the most diverse class of minerals; they are also of major technical importance.<br>
Glass, porcelain, enamel, earthenware, concrete and soluble glass are technically important<br>
products that are made of silicates.<br>
Silicates can be divided into the following groups according to their structure: a) silicates with<br>
discrete anions like nesosilicates (inselsilicates, orthosilicates with anion [Si04]'*'), sorosilicates<br>
(group-silicates, all [Si04]-tetrahedrons being combined in one finite group), cyclosilicates (ring<br>
silicates, where [Si04]-tetrahedrons form rings), b) inosilicates (chain and band silicates, where<br>
[Si04]-tetrahedrons form chains, i.e. one-dimensional unlimited shapes that can be seen as<br>
polymers of the anion [SiOa] "), c) phyllosilicates (sheet and compound silicates, where the<br>
[Si04]-tetrahedrons form a chain on one level, they form compound grids and can be seen as<br>
polymers of the anion [Si40io]'^') and d) tectosilicates (frame silicates, where the<br>
[Si04]-tetrahedrons form three-dimensional networks). Zeolites and feldspars are technically the<br>
most important mineral silicates.<br>
Zeolites are mineral silicates and especially aluminusilicates with a chemically complex structure<br>
which is characterized through the formation of porous tetrahedron networks. According to the<br>
general definition by IZA (International Zeolite Association) zeolites are minerals that form<br>
tetrahedron networks with a network density of more than 19 tetrahedron atoms per 1000 A'.<br>
Zeolites have a structure with inner hollow spaces that will reach the size of a molecule.<br>
Therefore zeolites can incorporate foreign atoms or foreign molecules into their microporous<br>
structure, e.g. zeolites can save huge amounts of water and release it when they are heated up.<br>
Zeolite materials in contact with a heat exchanger can therefore be easily used to create a latent<br>
heat store. According to the prior art, fills of zeolite or materials containing zeolites that are<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	Page 1<br><br>
poured into open-pored solids like metal sponges that are in thermal contact with a heat<br>
exchanger are used for this process. Please see DE 101 59 652 C2, for example, for this process.<br>
Fills of zeolite are not suitable for applications that require heat addition to zeolites or heat<br>
removal from zeolite materials because the thermal contact to the neighbouring heat exchanging<br>
structures is insufficient. Furthermore, especially for latent heat stores, the working medium<br>
customarily referred to as sorptive must be added as sorb material to the zeolite in an effective<br>
manner. This requires macroscopic channel structures in the sorb material. For this reason the<br>
pulverised synthesized zeolite will be pressed into bigger units in the shape of pellets with the<br>
help of a binder for such purposes. Unfortunately most binders influence and change the relevant<br>
properties of zeolites in a negative way. In addition, the usage of pellets does not guarantee<br>
enough thermal contact to neighbouring heat exchangers. For this reason the usage of systems of<br>
heat exchangers to which a zeolite coating is applied is recommended. Typically, in known<br>
processes for coating substrates with zeolites there is first a synthesis interval where the zeolite<br>
material is created. This zeolite material can be treated mechanically afterward, e.g. it can be<br>
ground or reduced in size, so that a powdered zeolite is created. Afterward the pre-synthesised<br>
zeolite material will be mixed with a binder and coated onto the carrier substrate.<br>
However, it is very difficult to coat the whole surface of the heat exchanger with a zeolite<br>
coating of uniform thickness, especially on complex three-dimensional heat exchange structures.<br>
Furthermore, such a post synthesis coating process consists of many production steps. In<br>
addition, most binders change the properties of zeolites because the molecules that are to be<br>
bound do not have free access to the inner microporous structure of the zeolite particles.<br>
A number of suggestions have been made with regard to the synthesis of silicates in the<br>
literature. The most interesting ones are the sol-gel synthesis procedure and hydrothermal<br>
synthesis. Hydrothermal synthesis is generally the synthesis of minerals and chemical<br>
compounds through crystallization of highly-heated aqueous solutions, i.e. hydrothermal<br>
solutions with a temperature of more than 100 °C and a pressure of more than 1 bar. In most<br>
cases hydrothermal synthesis is carried out in pressure containers because the temperatures used<br>
to carry out the process are far higher than the boiling point of water, most even above its critical<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	Page 2<br><br>
temperature of TK "- 374 °C. In its supercritical state water dissolves some water-insoluble<br>
materials. The increased ability to dissolve is most likely derived from compression because the<br>
smaller physical distance increases the interaction with the dissolved material. Therefore there is<br>
a possibility for producing mesoscopic inorganic colloids, crystals or powders in aqueous<br>
systems during hydrothermal synthesis. This synthesis generally produces particles having a<br>
diameter of only a few |Jm.<br>
Apart from these procedures that have been known for some time, a new process for producing<br>
silicate coatings through a spin coating procedure has recently emerged. The production of<br>
porous coatings, porous coatings themselves and the use of these coatings in microelectronics are<br>
described in WO 02/ 032 589 Al. The coatings can consist of periodically porous particles of<br>
one zeolite where the particles have a diameter of only a few nanometers and the coatings have a<br>
thickness of 30 to 1000 nm. The described coatings are applied to a silicon surface.<br>
A major problem in the hydrothermal synthesis of silicates is nucleation, which determines the<br>
morphology and the particle size distribution of the formed particles. In thermodynamic terms<br>
the formation of seed crystals and generally all crystals or particles represents a phase formation<br>
and is therefore subject to its own specific laws. Due to entropy decrease it is highly unlikely that<br>
a spontaneous formation of particles will occur because particles consist of a number of particles.<br>
Therefore a precipitation or a formation of particles, powders or crystals always requires an<br>
induction phase in which the primary seed crystals are formed. A broad particle size distribution<br>
and an energetically minimized particle surface are the result if the formation of seed crystals<br>
during the induction phase is slow. If the formation of seed crystals is fast, growth will be<br>
homogeneous, particle size will be small, and size distribution will be narrow.<br>
The processes of nucleation in solution and/or on the substrate, transportation of seed crystals<br>
onto the surface and their most homogeneous, lateral growth on the substrate surface are<br>
necessary requirements for the precipitation of dense silicate coatings on a metallic substrate<br>
during hydrothermal synthesis.<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	"	^	Page 3<br><br>
Therefore one object of the present invention is to offer a process that can produce an even and<br>
homogeneous coating of a metaUic carrier with silicates within a short coating time. A further<br>
object of the invention is to offer a process for creating a silicate coating that consists of<br>
individual particles with a very narrow particle size distribution. Moreover, a lateral<br>
homogeneous precipitation of thick silicate coatings on a metallic substrate that can be achieved<br>
directly shall be offered. Another object of the invention is to offer a layered amalgam that can<br>
be produced using a cost-effective method.<br>
These objects are attained with a process for the production of a layered amalgam made up of a<br>
metallic carrier substrate and a silicate coating, comprising the following process steps:<br>
a) preparation of the metallic carrier substrate, b) production of silicate crystals and/or silicate<br>
particles through solvo-thermal synthesis in at least one ionic liquid and c) coating of at least one<br>
surface of the metallic carrier substrate with the silicate crystals and/or silicate particles produced<br>
inb).<br>
Here and in what follows, a solvo-thermal synthesis is a hydrothermal analogue synthesis in a<br>
solvent other than water, where the temperature and pressures are regulated according to the<br>
various solvents. In this context a coating is a continuous substance layer that covers a whole<br>
area with only very few surface defects. Further, an ionic liquid is a salt which is liquid at room<br>
temperature and is made up of a complex inorganic cation or an organic cation containing<br>
niti^ogen, oxygen, sulphur, phosphorous or other homologs as the heteroatom, and inorganic or<br>
organic anions. Cation and anion can be formed through derivatization in such a way that they<br>
require a lot of room and extend the area of existence of the solution. These ionic liquids have<br>
very low melting points because they are sahs. In addition, ionic liquids have broad thermal fluid<br>
area and good thermal stability and are hydrolysis-resistant. Because of their physicochemical<br>
properties as melted salts, i.e. because cations and anions without solvate shells are freely<br>
movable, ionic liquids generally have no intrinsic vapour pressure in thermal stabihty. It is as yet<br>
unclear whether in isolated cases pairs of ions or even single ions can be vaporized from the<br>
solution into the gas phase through thermal excitation. An overview of the types and properties<br>
of ionic fluids can be found in P. Wasserscheid, T. Welton "Ionic Tiquids in Synthesis" Wiley<br>
VCH2003.<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	Page 4<br><br>
Surprisingly it has been discovered that nucleation is achieved 1000 times faster if at least one<br>
ionic liquid is used as solvent in the solvothermal synthesis of silicates, in comparison with the<br>
known hydrothermal synthesis. Therefore, if an ionic liquid and not water is used as the solvent<br>
in the synthesis of silicate crystals and/or silicate particles, significantly shorter synthesis times<br>
are possible, corresponding to about half the synthesis time in water. In addition, if at least one<br>
ionic liquid is used as the solvent, the equipment that is more involved in terms of security<br>
technology as compared with the known hydrothermal synthesis is not necessary. Because of<br>
lower pressures in general the security equipment necessary for high pressures is not needed. It<br>
was also surprising to see that the synthesis of undesired species that can be found in an aqueous<br>
environment or when water is used as the solvent can be suppressed to a large extent. Another<br>
advantage of the use of ionic liquids as the solvent in the solvothermal synthesis of silicates is<br>
that the choice of anions and cations of ionic liquids adds properties to the solution that can be<br>
achieved in hydrothermal synthesis only through the combination of water as solvent and<br>
dissolved neutral molecules or electrolytes.<br>
According to a second preferred process, the synthesis of silicate crystals and/or silicate particles<br>
is carried out in a mixture of at least two different ionic liquids.<br>
The ionic liquid or the mixture of at least two different ionic liquids used according to the<br>
invention will preferably contain at least one salt made up of a hydrophilic or hydrophobic anion<br>
X, particularly a hydrophilic or hydrophobic univalent, divalent or trivalent anion X"^" with m<br>

1-ethylpropyl-, 2-ethylpropyl-, 1,1-dimethylpropyl-, 1,2-dimethylpropyl-, 2,2-dimethylpropyl-.<br>
n-hexyl-, 2-ethylhexyl-, n-heptyl-, n-octyl-, n-nonyl-, n-decyl-, n-undecyl- or n-dodecyl group.<br>
According to an especially preferred process, the ionic liquid or the mixture of at least two ionic<br>
liquids is comprised of a minimum of one l-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium halogenide [Formula<br>
(II) wherein R3 = methyl and R2 ^ alkyl], wherein alkyl means a linear or branched, saturated<br>
carbon with a carbon chain length from C-1 to C-30, and especially is a methyl-, ethyl- n-propyl-<br>
, 1-methylethyl-, n-butyl-, 1-methylpropyl-, 2-methylpropyl-, 1,1-dimethylethyl-, n-pentyl-,<br>
1-methylbutyl-, 2-methylbutyl-, 3-methylbutyl-, 1-ethylpropyl-, 2-ethylpropyl-,<br>
1,1-dimethylpropyl-, 1,2-dimethylpropyl-, 2,2-dimethylpropyl-, n-hexyl-, 2-ethylhexyl-,<br>
n-heptyl-, n-octyl-, n-nonyl-, n-decyl-, n-undecyl- or n-dodecyl group, and wherein halogenide is<br>
chloride or bromide.<br>
There are further possibilities for anion-cation combinations which can be suitable for ionic<br>
liquid. In particular, through the systematic combination of anion and cation salts, ionic liquids<br>
as solvothermal solvent phases can be produced with specific properties, such as, for example, a<br>
melting point and thermal stability. In a preferred variant of the invention the ionic liquid<br>
represents a Bronsted acid and/or its salt, and serves thereby as a proton/cation source and/or<br>
contains a Bronsted acid and/or its salts, which serve as a proton/cation source.<br>
In addition, it can further be foreseen that the ionic liquid or the mixture of at least two ionic<br>
liquids additionally comprises promoter ions, wherein these are selected from the group of<br>
phosphate {P04^'), organic phosphates (RO-PO3'), nitrate (NO3"), sulphate (S04^"), organic<br>
sulphates (RO-SO3"), carboxylate (R-COO"), methanide ([HCRV^]" or [CR^R'^R'"]' with R^ R^<br>
R'" = CN, NO or NO2, wherein R^ R^ R'^ can be the same or different), fluoride (F"), chloride<br>
(Cr), bromide (Br"), azide (N3"), cyanide (CN"), cyanate (OCN), fulminate (R2CNO") or<br>
thiocyanate (SCN"). In particular, the organic groups R can be an alkyl residue. These promoter<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	Page 10<br><br>
ions can be added as an additive to an ionic liquid in any form, i.e. independent of an<br>
attached counterion.<br>
In ionic liquids, inorganic syntheses and especially silicate syntheses can be conducted under<br>
relatively mild conditions, which lead to a targeted synthesis of silicates with defined structural<br>
components. On one hand, synthesis can be carried out under temperatures that are below a<br>
specific level; the synthesis can especially be conducted at a temperature under 250 °C,<br>
especially under 200 °C and especially preferably between 50 °C and 150 °C. On the other hand,<br>
the synthesis can be carried out in a water-free or controlled water-containing environment. In<br>
an especially preferred process, synthesis is carried out in a controlled water-containing<br>
environment, wherein the amount of water is at most double the amount of the stoichiometric<br>
parts of water based upon the quantity necessary for the synthesis of the respective silicates. In<br>
such a reaction medium, secondary reactions, which take place in a hydrothermal synthesis based<br>
upon system conditions, is almost completely suppressed, whereby a nearly optimal reaction<br>
condition for targeted synthesis is made available. Afterwards, in a preferred method of the<br>
invention, the synthesis of silicates is performed at the highest at 150 °C and especially 50 °C to<br>
150 °C and especially in an autoclave at 50 °C to 150 °C. In particular the synthesis of silicates<br>
is carried out in an autoclave at 50 °C to 150 °C and with a quantity of water that is at most<br>
double the stoichiometric quantity in relation the silicate to be synthesized. The autoclave is a<br>
closed vessel which remains closed during the entire reaction time, so that the total pressure<br>
established with the dialled-in temperature is maintained. With this, the solvothermal conditions<br>
are established in a very simple way. Through the use of ionic liquids as solvents and the<br>
controlled amount of water, the high-pressure autoclaves that are necessary for hydrothermal<br>
synthesis can be dispensed with.<br>
In addition, it can be foreseen that the solvothermal synthesis can be carried out in an autoclave<br>
system with convection. This convection establishes a laminar flow on the metallic carrier<br>
substrate surface. Through this, the surface is supplied with an especially even concentration of<br>
synthesized silicates, or with the even concentration of dissolved components established with<br>
the laminar flow, a very uniform growth of silicates on the metal surface results. This represents<br>
a significant difference from the classic hydrothermal synthesis, in which only a material<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	Page 11<br><br>
transport through convection in a gravity field is ensured, which is supported by an internal<br>
stirring process, which does not for its part lead to a laminar flow. In particular, this is a process<br>
in which the process steps (b) and (c) can be carried out at the same time. In an especially<br>
preferred process the synthesis of the silicates follows process step (b) and the coating follows<br>
process step (c) in a muhi-chamber autoclave, so that the process steps (b) and (c) can be carried<br>
out at the same time. A multi-chamber autoclave is understood to be a pressure vessel which has<br>
at least two compartments, wherein each compartment is isothermically isolated from the<br>
remaining compartments. In a first compartment, the metal carrier substrate is brought in,<br>
whereas in the at least second compartment a convection current is present, through which a<br>
laminar current is generated on the surface of the metal carrier substrate. With this, there can be<br>
a fast nuclear build-up at each point in the ionic liquid caused by the ionic liquid, and these<br>
nuclei can be placed in a very uniform concentration on the metallic surface, and/or a very<br>
homogenous nuclear formation can take place on the metallic surface. This homogeneous<br>
nuclear formation in the ionic liquid and/or on the metallic surface of the carrier substrate causes<br>
a growth of homogenous silicate layers on the metal surface.<br>
In the manufacture of the particles, crystals or the resulting or in-situ constructed layers, the ionic<br>
liquids can further be used as stabilizing agents on the surface of the growing particles. Anionic<br>
or cationic constructed parts can thereby take over the role as stabilisers, which in the classic<br>
systems are added as molecular additives. In this way, solvothermal systems can be built, which<br>
significantly extend the property and application spectrum of classic water-based systems.<br>
With the method recommended here, a layered amalgam can be produced whose silicate layer is<br>
very homogeneous with regard to its layer thickness at each part of the layered amalgam, and in<br>
addition is very homogeneous with regard to the individual particles from which the silicate layer<br>
is made. Through the faster nucleus build-up, as compared with classic hydrothermal synthesis,<br>
the nucleus build-up is easier in comparison with particle or crystal growth. Therefore, particles<br>
or crystals and layers result from the recommended process, which have a very narrow particle<br>
size distribution. This narrow particle size distribution in turn guarantees a homogeneous silicate<br>
layer on the metal carrier substrate. A cohesive silicate layer will therefore be attained by newly<br>
formed nuclei growing on already established nuclei on the metal carrier substrate.<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	^	'	Page 12<br><br>
Accordingly, in a preferred method an especially homogeneous silicate layer can have a layer<br>
thickness of at least 10 microns, especially 10 microns and at the highest 200 microns, and most<br>
especially at least 50 microns and at the highest 150 microns. In a further preferred method, the<br>
silicate layer has particles or crystals that have a particle diameter of at most 200 nm, especially<br>
10 to 150 nm.<br>
In keeping with the classic synthesis method for silicates and especially for zeolites, the starting<br>
materials necessary for the build-up of the silicate structure or the zeolite structure are placed in<br>
an aqueous solution or suspension. Such an aqueous suspension comprises a first component,<br>
which is a source for cations from the first or second main group of the Periodic Table, and<br>
water. In addition, there is a second component, which is a source for at least a network building<br>
eleinent from the third, fourth or fifth main group of the Periodic Table. The amount of water in<br>
the solution or suspension is chosen such that at most a double stoichiometric quantity that<br>
corresponds to the silicate to be synthesized is present.<br>
In particular, with the above-mentioned new method, a synthesis of aluminium silicates and<br>
especially of zeolites of the general formula (VII) can be carried out:<br>
M2/zO • AI2O3-X Si02 ■ yUiO (VII)<br>
wherein M: is one or more as a cation from the group of alkali or alkaline-earth elements,<br>
hydrogen and/or ammonia,<br>
Z: is the valence of the cation or the total of the valences of the cations,<br>
X: is 1.8 to 12, and<br>
Y: is 0 to 8.<br>
The further synthesis conditions for the manufacture of durable silicate layers or zeolite layers on<br>
the metal carrier substrate can be chosen within the framework of the expert measurement<br>
according to the classic silicate synthesis. In this, as the metallic carrier substrates especially a<br>
metallic substrate made of copper, aluminium, iron, alloys of these, or stainless steel should<br>
be chosen.<br>
WO 2007/017015 A2	PageJs<br><br>
With the above-described invention, a layered amalgam is further produced via the<br>
above-described process. This layered amalgam can especially be used in a heat exchanger.<br>
Accordingly, with the present invention a heat exchanger is also recommended, which is<br>
produced using the above-described process. These layered amalgams are especially<br>
characterized by an effective energy transfer in a heat exchanger.<br>
In particular, with the present invention a heat exchanger is also proposed, which has a metallic<br>
carrier substrate and a silicate layer, which in turn contains silicate particles or silicate crystals,<br>
which have a maximal particle size of 200 nm, especially maximally 150 nm and especially<br>
preferably a particle size of 50 to 150 nm.<br>
