The ability of the compound of formula I; to inhibit Janus Kinase 3 and, consequently, demonstrate its effectiveness for treating disorders or conditions characterized by Janus Kinase 3 is shown by the following in vitro assay tests.<br>
Biological Assay JAK3 (JH1 :GST) Enzymatic Assay<br>
The JAK3 kinase assay utilizes a protein expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells (a fusion protein of GST and the catalytic domain of human JAK3) purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepaharose. The substrate for the reaction is poly-Glutamic acid-Tyrosine (PGT (4:1), Sigma catalog # P0275), coated onto Nunc Maxi Sorp plates at 100 µg/ml overnight at 37°C. The morning after coating, the plates are washed three times and JAK3 is added to the wells containing 100 µl of kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 125 mM NaCI, 24 mM MgCI2)+ 0.2 uM ATP + 1 mM Na orthovanadate.) The reaction proceeds for 30 minutes at room temperature and the plates is washed three more times. The level of phosphorylated tyrosine in a given well is quantitated by standard ELISA assay utilizing an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (ICN PY20, cat. #69-151-1).<br>
Inhibition of Human IL-2 Dependent T-Cell Blast Proliferation<br>
This screen measures the inhibitory effect of compounds on IL-2 dependent T-Cell blast proliferation in vitro. Since signaling through the IL-2 receptor requires JAK-3, cell active inhibitors of JAK-3 should inhibit IL-2 dependent T-Cell blast proliferation.<br>
The cells for this assay are isolated from fresh human blood. After separation of the mononuclear cells using Accuspin System-Histopaque-1077 (Sigma # A7054), primary human T-Cells are isolated by negative selection using Lympho-Kwik T (One Lambda, Inc., Cat# LK-50T). T-Ceils are cultured at 1-2 x 106/ml in Media (RPMI + 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Cat # A-1111-L) + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco)) and induce to proliferate by the addition of 10ug/rnl<br>
PHA (Murex Diagnostics,, Cat # HA 16). After 3 days at 37°C in 5% C02, cells are washed 3 times in Media, resuspended to a density of 1-2 x 106 cells/ml in Media plus 100 Units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (R&amp;D Systems, Cat # 202-IL). After 1 week the cells are IL-2 dependent and can be maintained for up to 3 weeks by feeding twice weekly with equal volumes of Media + 100 Units/ml of IL-2.<br>
To assay for a test compounds ability to inhibit IL-2 dependent T-Cell proliferation, IL-2 dependent cells are washed 3 times, resuspended in media and then plated (50,000 cells/well/0.lml) in a Flat-bottom 96-well microliter plate (Falcon # 353075). From a10 mM stock of test compound in DMSO, serial 2-fold dilutions of compound are added in triplicate wells starting at 10 uM. After one hour, 10 Units/ml of IL-2 is added to each test well. Plates are then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 72 hours. Plates are then pulsed with 3H-thymidine (0.5 uCi/well) (NEN Cat # NET027A), and incubated an additional 18 hours. Culture plates are then harvested with a 96-well plate harvester and the amount of 3H-thymidine incorporated into proliferating cells is determined by counting on a Packard Top Count scintillation counter. Data is analyzed by plotting the % inhibition of proliferation verses the concentration of test compound. An IC50 value (uM) is determined from this plot.<br>
The present species demonstrates a more than 5-fold potency in the Jak-3 Enzyme Assay and a more than 4-fold potency in the IL-2 Blast Assay.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention but it is not limited to the details thereof. Melting points are uncorrected. NMR data are reported in parts per million (5) and are referenced to the deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent (deuteriochloroform unless otherwise specified).<br>
Example I<br>
3-{(3R,4R)-4-methyl-3-[methyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amino]-<br>
piperidin-I -yl}-3-oxo-propionitrile mono citrate salt<br>
Ethanol (13 liters), (3R, 4R)-methyl-(4-methyl-piperidin-3-yl)-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidm-4-yl)-amine (1.3 kg), cyano-acetic acid 2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl ester (1.5 kg), and triethylamine (1.5 liters) were combined and stirred at ambient temperature. Upon reaction completion (determined by High Pressure Liquid Chromotography (HPLC) analysis, approximately 30 minutes), the solution was filtered, concentrated and azeotroped with 15 liters of methylene chloride. The reaction mixture was washed sequentially with 12 liters of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide solution, 12 liters of brine and 12 liters of water. The organic layer was concentrated and azeotroped with 3 liters of acetone (final pot temperature was 42°C).   The resulting solution was<br>
cooled to 20°C to 25°C followed by addition of 10 liters of acetone. This solution was filtered and then aqueous citric acid (0.8 kg in 4 liters of water) added via in-line filter. The reaction mixture was allowed to granulate. The slurry was cooled before collecting the solids by filtration. The solids were dried to yield 1.9 kg (71%) (3R, 4R)-3-{4-Methy!-3-tmethyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrirnidin-4-yl)-amino]-piperidin-1-yl}-3-oxo-propionitrile mono citrate. This material was then combined with 15 liters of a 1:1 ratio of ethanol/water and the slurry was agitated overnight. The solids were filtered and dried to afford 1.7 kg (63% from (3R, 4R)methyl-(4-methyl-piperidin-3-yl)-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrirnidin-4-yI)-amine) of the title compound as a white crystalline solid. 1H NMR (400 MH2)(D20) δ HOD: 0.92 (2H, d, J = 7.2 Hz), 0.96 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz), 1.66 (1H, m), 1.80 (1H, m), 2.37 (1H, m), 2.58 (2H, 1/2 ABq, J = 15.4 Hz), 2.70 (2H, 34 ABq, J = 154 Hz), 3.23 (2H, s), 3.25 (1H, s), 3.33 (1H, m), 3.46 (1H, m), 3.81 (4H, m). 4.55 (1H, m), 6.65 (1H, d, J = 3.2 Hz), 7.20 (1H, t, J = 3.2 Hz), 8.09 (1H, m).<br>

piperidin-1-yl}-3-oxo-propionitrile mono citrate salt<br>
To a solution of 79 grams of ((3R, 4R)-1-Benzyl-4-methyl-piperidin-3-yl)-methyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amine dissolved in 2 liters of ethanol was added 79 grams of 20% palladium hydroxide on carbon (50% water by weight) and the mixture agitated under an atmospheric pressure of 50 psi hydrogen for three days (conducting the hydrogenolysis at elevated temperature [50°C to 70°C] significantly decreases reaction times). After the catalyst was removed by filtration through Celite®, 51 grams of cyano-acetic acid 2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl ester was added to the ethanolic solution and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, at which time the ethanol was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was redissolved in 1.0 liters of dichloromethane and the solution sequentially washed with 0.6 liters of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 0.4 liters saturated sodium bicarbonate. The combined aquepus layers were backwashed with 0.4 liters of dichloromethane, the dichloromethane layers combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo affording 61 grams of amber oil. This material was then redissolved in 2.1 liters of acetone and the solution heated to 40°C. Finely ground citric acid (37 grams) was added slowly (as a solid) to the solution. The mixture continued stirring at 40°C for two hours (granulation was complete).<br>
After cooling to room temperature, the solids were collected by filtration, washed with acetone and dried in vacuo affording 78.5 grams (66% from ((3R, 4R)-1-Benzy]-4-methyi-piperidin-3-yl)-methyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amine) of the title compound as a slightly off-white crystalline solid.<br>

d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amino]-piperidin-1-yl)-3-oxo-propionitrile     (230     mg/0.74     mmol)<br>
dissolved in 23 mL of acetone was heated to 40°C. To this solution was added 155<br>
mg (0.81 mmol) of finely ground citric acid. The resulting mixture stirred at 40°C for 2<br>
hours, then at 30°C for 4 hours followed by stirring at room temperature for an<br>
additional 18 hours. At this point, the solids were collected by filtration, washed with<br>
acetone and dried in vacuo affording 280 mg (75%) of the title compound as a white<br>
crystalline solid.<br>
Example 4 Method for collecting powder X-ray diffraction for 3-((3R,4R)-4-methyl-3-methyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amino]-piperidin-1-yl)-3-oxo-propionitrile mono citrate salt Powder x-ray diffraction patterns for 3-{(3R,4R)-4-methyl-3-[methyl-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-amino]-piperidin-1-yl}-3-oxo-propionitrile mono citrate salt were collected using a Bruker D5000 diffractometer (Madison, Wisconsin) equipped with copper radiation, fixed slits (1.0,1.0, 0.6mm) and a Kevex solid state detector. Data was collected as follows: Cu anode; wavelength 1:1.54056; wavelength 2: 1.54439 (rel. intensity: 0.500); from 3.0 to 40.0 degrees in 2 theta using a step size of 0.04 degrees and a step time of 1.0 seconds. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br>
