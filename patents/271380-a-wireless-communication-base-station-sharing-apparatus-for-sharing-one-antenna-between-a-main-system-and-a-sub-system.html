				<td>APPARATUS FOR USING A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION BASE<br>
STATION IN COMMON<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a wireless communication<br>
system, and in particular, to a wireless communication base station sharing<br>
apparatus for sharing an antenna and a feeder cable in deploying wireless<br>
communication systems that provide services in different frequency bands.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As illustrated in FIGs. 1A, 1B and 1C, a plurality of service providers<br>
provide services through independent base stations (BSs) 10 and 12 in cellular,<br>
CDMA, PCS and GSM mobile communication systems and other wireless<br>
communication systems. The resulting redundant investment regarding<br>
installation of individual BSs and unnecessary existence of too many BSs in an<br>
adjacent area lead to signal quality degradation due to mutual interference<br>
between the BSs.<br>
As it has occurred recently that one service provider merges other<br>
service providers and thus needs to provide services, integrating the frequency<br>
bands of the service providers. In this case, a need exists for unifying the<br>
existing system with the added systems to reduce cost. One service provider may<br>
be assigned different frequencies in different areas in overseas. He must deploy<br>
BS systems operating in different frequency bands locally.<br>
To overcome this problem, techniques for sharing a BS have been<br>
developed. One of the techniques is to share a BS antenna and a feeder cable by<br>
use of a new quadroplexer 132 covering the frequency bands of an existing BS<br>
system, for example, a system 10 (system A) and a sub-BS system, for example,<br>
a system 12 (system B), as illustrated in FIG. 1C.<br>
This technique requires fabrication of such a quadroplexer as allows two<br><br>
systems to share an antenna and a feeder cable. Moreover, in case of different<br>
frequency bands assigned to a service provider in different areas, many<br>
quadroplexers must be fabricated. If the frequency band of a subsystem is<br>
changed while the subsystem is operated, sharing an antenna and a feeder cable<br>
with a main system, a new quadroplexer is needed. If a plurality of subsystems<br>
are added, a plurality of new quadroplexers are to be fabricated.<br>
As described above, since a new quadroplexer must be fabricated to<br>
share an antenna and a feeder cable between an existing main system and an<br>
added subsystem in the conventional technology. Therefore, fabrication cost and<br>
management cost are increased.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a wireless<br>
communication BS sharing apparatus for allowing an existing main BS system<br>
and an added sub-BS system to easily share a BS antenna and a feeder cable<br>
irrespective of the frequency band of the sub-BS system in deploying the sub-BS<br>
system in addition to the existing main BS system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a wireless<br>
communication BS sharing apparatus for allowing an existing main BS system<br>
and an added sub-BS system to easily share a BS antenna and a feeder cable<br>
without using additional equipment even though the frequency bands of the main<br>
BS system and the sub-BS system are changed in deploying the sub-BS system<br>
in addition to the existing main BS system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a wireless<br>
communication BS sharing apparatus for, despite a plurality of added sub-BS<br>
systems, allowing a main BS system and the sub-BS systems to easily share an<br>
antenna and a feeder cable.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a wireless<br><br>
communication BS sharing apparatus for allowing different operation systems to<br>
easily share a given frequency band separately.<br>
The above objects are achieved by providing a wireless communication<br>
base station sharing apparatus for sharing one antenna between a main system<br>
and a subsystem. In the wireless communication base station sharing apparatus,<br>
a first signal combiner/distributor is connected to a transmission/reception signal<br>
line of a main system duplexer through a first port, distributes a signal received<br>
through the first port to second and third ports, combines the signals received<br>
through the second and third ports according to the phases of the signals, and<br>
provides the combined signal through the first port or a fourth port. A second<br>
signal combiner/distributor is connected to a transmission/reception signal line<br>
of a subsystem duplexer through a fifth port and the antenna through an eighth<br>
port, distributes a signal received through the fifth port to sixth and seventh ports,<br>
combines the signals received through the sixth and seventh ports according to<br>
the phases of the signals, and provides the combined signal through the fifth or<br>
eighth port. A first variable filter is provided in a signal path between the second<br>
port of the first signal combiner/distributor and the sixth port of the second<br>
signal combiner/distributor. A first variable filter is provided in a signal path<br>
between the third port of the first signal combiner/distributor and the seventh<br>
port of the second signal combiner/distributor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a wireless communication BS sharing<br>
apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG.<br>
2, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 20 is so configured as to<br>
share an antenna between a main system 22 with a third duplexer 222 and a<br>
subsystem 24 with a fourth duplexer 242. This BS sharing apparatus 20 includes<br>
the main system with the third duplexer, the subsystem with the fourth duplexer,<br>
a first hybrid coupler 202 for distributing a transmission signal received from the<br>
main system 22 through a first port and outputting the distributed transmission<br><br>
signals with different phases, a first variable duplexer 206 connected to a second<br>
port of the first hybrid coupler 202, for filtering transmission and reception<br>
signals Rx1 and Rx1 of the main system 22, a second variable duplexer 208<br>
connected to a third port of the first hybrid coupler 202, for filtering the<br>
transmission and reception signals Txl and Rxl of the main system 22, and a<br>
second hybrid coupler 204 with a fifth port connected to the subsystem, for<br>
receiving signals from the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208<br>
through sixth and seventh ports and combining the signals.<br>
The antenna is connected to an eighth port of the second hybrid coupler<br>
204.<br>
The first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208 include filters for<br>
passing only the transmission and reception frequency bands of the main system<br>
22.<br>
If the main system 22 is exchanged with the subsystem 24 in position,<br>
the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208 may include filters for<br>
passing only the transmission and reception frequency bands of the subsystem<br>
24. The third and fourth duplexers 222 and 242 are full-band duplexers.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3, the operation of the hybrid couplers will be<br>
described. The hybrid couplers characteristically function to partially extract<br>
specific signal power and to distribute one signal power into two or more<br>
particular signal powers. The latter function will be described in the present<br>
invention. A signal received through the first port is output through the second<br>
and third ports, its power being divided into two halves. The signal is not output<br>
through the fourth port. There is a 90-degree phase difference between the output<br>
signals. In the opposite case, if signals with a 90-degree phase difference are<br>
received through the second and third ports, they are combined and output.<br>
To be more specific, if a signal received through the second port has a<br>
phase of 90 degrees and a signal received through the third port has a phase of<br><br>
180 degrees, the two signals are combined and output through the first port, not<br>
through the fourth port.<br>
If the signal received through the second port has a phase of 180 degrees<br>
and the signal received through the third port has a phase of 90 degrees, the two<br>
signals are combined and output through the fourth port, not through the first<br>
port. Such parts with the signal power distributing/combining function are a<br>
hybrid ring, a branch-line directional coupler, a 3-dB directional coupler, and a<br>
magic T.<br><transmission in main system><br>
The first hybrid coupler 202 receives through the first port the<br>
transmission signal TXl from the main system 22 which has passed the third<br>
duplexer 222 and distributes the received signal to the second and third ports, its<br>
phase being rotated by 90 degrees and 180 degrees, respectively for the second<br>
and third ports. Thus, the distributed signals have a phase difference of 90<br>
degrees. The signals from the second and third ports pass through the first and<br>
second variable duplexers 206 and 208 that pass only the transmission signal<br>
Txl of the main system 22 and are input to the sixth and seventh ports. The<br>
second hybrid coupler combines the signals received through the sixth and<br>
seventh ports and outputs the combined signal through the eighth port. This<br>
signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
The second hybrid coupler 204 distributes a signal received from the<br>
antenna through the eighth port to the sixth and seventh ports, the phase of the<br>
signal being rotated by 90 degrees and 180 degrees for the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, respectively. The first hybrid coupler 202 receives through the second and<br>
third ports the signals from the sixth and seventh ports which have passed<br>
through the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208, combines the<br>
signals, and outputs the combined signal through the first port. The signal from<br>
the first port is received in the main system 22 through the third duplexer 222.<br><transmission in subsystem><br><br>
A transmission signal TX2 from the subsystem 24 passes through the<br>
fourth duplexer 242 and is received at the second hybrid coupler 204 through the<br>
fifth port. The received signal is distributed to the sixth and seventh ports, its<br>
phase being rotated by 90 degrees and 180 degrees, respectively for the sixth and<br>
seventh ports. Thus, the distributed signals have a phase difference of 90 degrees.<br>
The signals from the sixth and seventh ports are fully reflected from the first and<br>
second variable duplexers 206 and 208 and fed back to the sixth and seventh<br>
ports. The feedback signals are combined and output through the eighth port.<br>
This signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in subsystem><br>
The second hybrid coupler 204 distributes a signal received from the<br>
antenna through the eighth port to the sixth and seventh ports, the phase of the<br>
signal being rotated by 180 degrees and 900 degrees for the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, respectively. The signals from the sixth and seventh ports are fully<br>
reflected from the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208 and fed back<br>
to the sixth and seventh ports. The feedback signals are combined and output<br>
through the fifth port. This signal from the fifth port is transferred to a receiver<br>
of the subsystem 24 through the fourth duplexer 242.<br>
Meanwhile, no reflection occurs theoretically during outputting the<br>
transmission signal Txl from the main system 22 through the first hybrid<br>
coupler 202. In practice, however, some of the transmission signal Txl is output<br>
through the fourth port, although it is slight. To prevent this problem, a load<br>
resistor TERM is provided at the fourth port, for isolation.<br>
The reason for using the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208<br>
instead of fixed duplexers in the above configuration is to adapt to both cases<br>
where the total transmission and reception frequency band of a BS system is<br>
dedicated to the main system or separated to the main system and the subsystem.<br>
For example, in the case where the service provider of a BS system<br>
provides a service to subscribers by operation system A, if operation system B<br><br>
has been developed to provide an enhanced service but an additional frequency<br>
band for operation system B cannot be secured, the service provider has to run<br>
operation system B with the existing limited frequency band.<br>
Then, if some subscribers want to continuously receive the service based<br>
on operation system A due to cost or for other reasons and others want to receive<br>
the enhanced service based on operation system B, the service provider must<br>
change frequency allocation adaptively according to the numbers of subscribers<br>
regarding operation systems A and B, running the two operation systems within<br>
the limited frequency in order to satisfy the different demands of the subscribers.<br>
FIGs. 12A and 12B illustrate a change in frequency band when a<br>
subsystem is added by dividing a frequency band. For example, the frequency<br>
band is a transmission frequency band. As illustrated in FIG. 12A, the first and<br>
second variable duplexers 206 and 208 are band-shift filters for appropriately<br>
shifting a filtering band according to an external control signal. When only the<br>
main system 22 is provided to the BS sharing apparatus, the first and second<br>
variable duplexers 206 and 208 can be set to filter a service frequency band<br>
allocated to a corresponding sendee provider.<br>
If the service provider adds the subsystem 24 and wants to provide a<br>
service through the main system 22 and the subsystem 24 by dividing the service<br>
frequency band, the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208 shift the<br>
filtering band according to the external control signal such that it does not<br>
include a bandwidth allocated to the subsystem, as illustrated in FIG. 12B.<br>
The shift of the filtering band by use of the first and second variable<br>
duplexers 206 and 208, not frequency band-fixed duplexers, enables addition of<br>
a subsystem to a main system through frequency band division.<br>
A frequency band-variable filter that can change a frequency band is<br>
disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 2004-46103 filed by the present<br>
applicant.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a wireless communication BS sharing<br>
apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring<br>
to FIG. 4, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 40 includes the main<br>
system with the third duplexer, the subsystem with the fourth duplexer, a first<br>
magic T 402 for distributing a transmission signal received from the third<br>
duplexer 222 of the main system 22 through a first port and outputting the<br>
distributed transmission signals with different phases, a first phase rotator 412<br>
for receiving a signal from a second port of the first magic T 402 and rotating the<br>
phase of the received signal, a first variable duplexer 406 for filtering the signal<br>
received from the first phase rotator 412, a second phase rotator 414 for rotating<br>
the signal received from the first variable duplexer 406, a second variable<br>
duplexer 408 for filtering a signal received from a third port of the first magic T<br>
402, and a second magic T 404 having a fifth port connected to the fourth<br>
duplexer 242 of the subsystem 24, for receiving the signals from the second<br>
phase rotator 414 and the second variable duplexer 408 through sixth and<br>
seventh ports, respectively and combining the signals.<br>
An antenna is connected to an eighth port of the second magic T 404.<br>
The first and second variable duplexers 406 and 408 are so configured as to pass<br>
only the transmission and reception frequency bands of the main system 22. If<br>
the main system 22 is exchanged with the subsystem 24 in position, the first and<br>
second variable duplexers 406 and 408 may include filters for passing only the<br>
transmission and reception frequency bands of the subsystem 24. The third and<br>
fourth duplexers 222 and 242 are full-band duplexers.<br>
With reference to FIG. 5, the basic operation of the magic Ts will be<br>
described. A signal received through the first port is distributed to the second and<br>
third ports with a phase difference of 180 degrees. On the other hand, a signal<br>
received through the fourth port is distributed to the second and third ports, with<br>
the same phase.<br>
If signals with a phase difference of 180 degrees in the same frequency<br>
are received through the second and third ports, they are combined and output<br><br>
through the first port. If the same-phase signals are received through the second<br>
and third ports, they are combined and output through the fourth port.<br><transmission in main system><br>
The transmission signal TXl from the main system 22 passes through<br>
the third duplexer 222 and is input to the first port of the first magic T 402. The<br>
first magic T 402 distributes the received signal to the second and third ports,<br>
with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The signal from the third port passes<br>
through the second variable duplexer 408 and is input to the seventh port of the<br>
second magic T 404. The phase of the signal from the second port is rotated by<br>
90 degrees in the first phase rotator 412. After passing through the first variable<br>
duplexer 406, the signal from the first phase rotator 412 is phase-rotated by 90<br>
degrees in the second phase rotator 414 and then output to the sixth port of the<br>
second magic T 404. Hence, the signals received in the second magic T 404<br>
through the sixth and seventh ports have the same phase. The second magic T<br>
404 combines these signals and outputs the combined signal through the eighth<br>
port. The signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
The second magic T 404 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>
eighth port and distributes the signal to the sixth and seventh ports, with the<br>
same phase. The signal from the seventh port is provided to the third port of the<br>
first magic T 402 through the second variable duplexer 408. The signal from the<br>
sixth port of the second magic T 404 is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the<br>
second phase rotator 414, passes through the first variable duplexer 406, phase-<br>
rotated again by 90 degrees in the first phase rotator 412, and then provided to<br>
the second port of the first magic T 402. Thus, the first magic T 402 receives the<br>
signals with a phase difference of 180 degrees through the second and third ports,<br>
combines them, and outputs the combined signal through the first port. The<br>
signal from the first port is provided to a receiver of the main system 22 through<br>
the third duplexer 222.<br><transmission in subsystem><br><br>
The transmission signal TX2 from the subsystem 24 passes through the<br>
fourth duplexer 242 and is provided to the fifth port of the second magic T 404.<br>
The second magic T 404 distributes the received signal to the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The signal from the seventh port is<br>
fully reflected from the second duplexer 208 and fed back to the seventh port.<br>
While the signal from the sixth port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second<br>
phase rotator 414, it is also fully reflected from the first variable duplexer 406,<br>
again phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 414, and fed back<br>
to the sixth port. Thus, the second magic T 404 receives the signals with the<br>
same phase through the sixth and seventh ports, combines them, and outputs the<br>
combined signal through the eighth port. This signal from the eighth port is<br>
radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in subsystem><br>
The second magic T 404 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>
eighth port and distributes the received signal to the sixth and seventh ports, with<br>
the same phase.<br>
The signal from the seventh port is fully reflected from the second<br>
duplexer 208 and fed back to the seventh port. While the signal from the sixth<br>
port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 414, it is also<br>
fully reflected from the first variable duplexer 406, again phase-rotated by 90<br>
degrees in the second phase rotator 414, and fed back to the sixth port.<br>
Thus, the second magic T 404 receives the signals with a phase<br>
difference of 180 degrees through the sixth and seventh ports, combines them,<br>
and outputs the combined signal through the fifth port.<br>
This signal from the fifth port is provided to the receiver of the<br>
subsystem 24 through the fourth duplexer 242.<br>
Meanwhile, no reflection occurs theoretically during outputting the<br>
transmission signal Txl from the main system 22 through the first magic T 402.<br><br>
In practice, however, some of the transmission signal Txl is output through the<br>
fourth port, although it is slight. To prevent this problem, the load resistor TERM<br>
is provided at the fourth port, for isolation.<br>
Similarly in the above configuration, the shift of the filtering band by<br>
use of the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208, not frequency band-<br>
fixed duplexers, enables addition of a subsystem to a main system through<br>
frequency band division.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a wireless communication BS sharing<br>
apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to<br>
FIG. 6, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 60 is so configured as to<br>
share an antenna between the main system 22 with the third duplexer 222 and a<br>
subsystem 26. This BS sharing apparatus 60 includes the main system with the<br>
third duplexer, the subsystem, a first hybrid coupler 602 for distributing a<br>
transmission signal received from the third duplexer 222 through a first port and<br>
a signal received from the antenna through a fourth port and outputting the<br>
distributed signals with different phases, a first variable band-pass filter 606 for<br>
filtering a signal received from a second port of the first hybrid coupler 602, a<br>
second variable band-pass filter 608 for filtering a signal received from a third<br>
port of the first hybrid coupler 602, a second hybrid coupler 604 for receiving<br>
signals from the first and second variable band-pass filters 606 and 608 through<br>
sixth and seventh ports and combining the signals, a fourth duplexer 622<br>
connected to a fifth port of the second hybrid coupler 604 and the subsystem 26,<br>
a distributor 624 connected between a receiver Rx of the fourth duplexer 622<br>
and the subsystem 26, for distributing a signal received from the receiver Rx of<br>
the fourth duplexer 622, and a reception filter 626 for filtering a distributed<br>
signal received from the distributor 624 and applying the filtered signal to the<br>
fourth port of the first hybrid coupler 602.<br>
The antenna is connected to an eighth port of the second hybrid coupler<br>
604. The receivers Rx of the third and fourth duplexers 222 and 622, and the<br>
reception filter 626 can be implemented by filters that pass both reception<br><br>
frequencies of the main system 22 and the subsystem 26, or full-band reception<br>
filters for passing the reception frequency band of the main system 22 and the<br>
subsystem 26 in a particular band (e.g. PCS band). The first and second variable<br>
band-pass filters 606 and 608 are so configured as to pass only the transmission<br>
frequency band of the main system 22.<br>
If the main system 22 is exchanged with the subsystem 26 in position,<br>
the first and second variable band-pass filters 606 and 608 may include filters for<br>
passing only the transmission frequency band of the subsystem 26. The fourth<br>
duplexer 622 may not be provided if it already exists in the subsystem 26.<br>
Needless to say, the subsystem 26 must have the distributor 624 in this case.<br>
The operations of the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus will<br>
be described below.<br><transmission in main system><br>
The first hybrid coupler 602 receives through the first port the<br>
transmission signal TXl from the main system 22 which has passed the third<br>
duplexer 222 and distributes the received signal to the second and third ports, its<br>
phase being rotated by 90 degrees and 180 degrees, respectively for the second<br>
and third ports. Thus, the distributed signals have a phase difference of 90<br>
degrees. The signals from the second and third ports pass through the first and<br>
second variable band-pass filters 606 and 608 that pass only the transmission<br>
signal Txl of the main system 22 and are provided to the sixth and seventh ports<br>
of the second hybrid coupler 604. The second hybrid coupler 604 combines the<br>
received signals and outputs the combined signal through the eighth port. This<br>
signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
The second hybrid coupler 604 distributes a signal received from the<br>
antenna through the eighth port to the sixth and seventh ports, the phase of the<br>
signal being rotated by 180 degrees and 90 degrees for the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, respectively. The signals from the sixth and seventh ports are fully<br><br>
reflected from the first and second variable band-pass filters 606 and 608 and fed<br>
back to the sixth and seventh ports. The feedback signals are combined and<br>
output through the fifth port. The distributor 624 receives the signal from the<br>
fifth port through the fourth duplexer 622 and distributes the received signal.<br>
One of the distributed signals is provided to the subsystem 26 and the other is<br>
provided to the fourth port of the first hybrid coupler 602 through the reception<br>
filter 626. The first hybrid coupler 602 distributes the received signal to the<br>
second and third ports with a phase difference of 90 degrees. The signals from<br>
the second and third ports are fully reflected from the first and second variable<br>
band-pass filters 606 and 608 and fed back to the second and third ports. These<br>
feedback signals are combined and output through the first port. The signal from<br>
the first port is received in the main system 22 through the third duplexer 222.<br><transmission in subsystem><br>
A transmission signal TX2 from the subsystem 26 passes through the<br>
fourth duplexer 622 and is provided to the second hybrid coupler 604 through<br>
the fifth port. The second hybrid coupler 604 distributes the received signal to<br>
the sixth and seventh ports, its phase being rotated by 180 degrees and 90<br>
degrees, respectively for the sixth and seventh ports. Thus, the distributed signals<br>
have a phase difference of 90 degrees. The signals from the sixth and seventh<br>
ports are fully reflected from the first and second variable band-pass filters 606<br>
and 608 and fed back to the sixth and seventh ports. The feedback signals are<br>
combined and output through the eighth port. The signal from the eighth filter is<br>
radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in subsystem><br>
A signal received through the antenna is provided to the eight port of the<br>
second hybrid coupler 608 and distributed to the sixth and seventh ports, its<br>
phase being rotated by 180 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively for the sixth and<br>
seventh ports. Thus, the distributed signals have a phase difference of 90 degrees.<br>
The signals from the sixth and seventh ports are fully reflected from the first and<br>
second variable band-pass filters 606 and 608 and fed back to the sixth and<br>
seventh ports. The feedback signals are combined and output through the fifth<br><br>
port. This signal from the fifth port passes through the fourth duplexer 622 and is<br>
provided to the receiver of the subsystem 26 through the distributor 624.<br>
Meanwhile, no reflection occurs theoretically during outputting the<br>
transmission signal Txl from the main system 22 through the first hybrid<br>
coupler 602. In practice, however, some of the transmission signal Txl is output<br>
through the fourth port, although it is slight. To prevent this problem, a circulator<br>
628 can be further provided between the reception filter 626 and the fourth port<br>
of the first hybrid coupler 602, for isolation, as illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
The reason for using the first and second variable duplexers 606 and 608<br>
instead of fixed duplexers in the above configuration is to adapt to both cases<br>
where the total transmission and reception frequency band of a BS system is<br>
dedicated to the main system or separated to the main system and the subsystem.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 12A, the first and second variable duplexers 606<br>
and 608 are band-shift filters for appropriately shifting a filtering band according<br>
to an external control signal. When only the main system 22 is provided to the<br>
BS sharing apparatus, the first and second variable duplexers 606 and 608 can be<br>
set to filter a service frequency band allocated to a corresponding service<br>
provider. If the service provider adds the subsystem 26 and wants to provide a<br>
service through the main system 22 and the subsystem 26 by dividing the service<br>
frequency band, the first and second variable duplexers 206 and 208 shift the<br>
filtering band according to the external control signal such that it does not<br>
include a bandwidth allocated to the subsystem 26, as illustrated in FIG. 12B.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram of a wireless communication BS sharing<br>
apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. Referring<br>
to FIG. 8, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 80 is so configured as<br>
to share an antenna between the main system 22 with the third duplexer 222 and<br>
the subsystem 26. The BS sharing apparatus 80 includes the main system with<br>
the third duplexer, the subsystem, a first magic T 802 for distributing a<br>
transmission signal received from the third duplexer 222 through a first port to<br><br>
second and third ports, with different phases and distributing a signal received<br>
from the antenna through a fourth port to the second and third ports, with the<br>
same phase, a first phase rotator 812 for receiving the signal from the second<br>
port of the first magic T 802 and rotating the phase of the received signal, a first<br>
variable band-pass filter 806 for filtering the signal received from the first phase<br>
rotator 812, a second phase rotator 814 for rotating the signal received from the<br>
first variable band-pass filter 806, a second variable band-pass filter 808 for<br>
filtering the signal received from the third port of the first magic T 802, and a<br>
second magic T 804 for receiving the signals from the second phase rotator 814<br>
and the second band-pass filter 808 through sixth and seventh ports, respectively<br>
and combining the signals, a fourth duplexer 822 connected between a fifth port<br>
of the second magic T 804 and the subsystem 26, a distributor 824 connected<br>
between a receiver Rx of the fourth duplexer 822 and the subsystem 26, for<br>
distributing a signal received from the receiver Rx of the fourth duplexer 822,<br>
and a reception filter 826 for filtering a distributed signal from the distributor<br>
824 and applying the filtered signal to the fourth port of the first magic T 802.<br>
The antenna is connected to an eighth port of the second magic T 804.<br>
The receivers Rx of the third and fourth duplexers 222 and 822, and the<br>
reception filter 826 can be implemented by reception filters that pass no<br>
reception frequencies of the main system 22 and the subsystem 26, or full-band<br>
filters that pass the reception frequency bands of the main system 22 and the<br>
subsystem 26 in a particular band (e.g. PCS band). The first and second variable<br>
band-pass filters 806 and 808 pass only the transmission frequency band of the<br>
main system 22. If the main system 22 is exchanged with the subsystem 26 in<br>
position, the first and second variable band-pass filters 806 and 808 may pass<br>
only the transmission and reception frequency bands of the subsystem 26. If a<br>
filter such as the fourth duplexer 822 already exists in the subsystem 26, the<br>
fourth duplexer 622 may not be provided.<br>
The operations of the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus will<br>
be described below.<br><br><transmission in main system><br>
The transmission signal TXl from the main system 22 passes through<br>
the third duplexer 222 and is provided to the first port of the first magic T 802.<br>
The first magic T 802 distributes the received signal to the second and third ports,<br>
with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The signal from the third port is provided<br>
to the seventh port of the second magic T 804 through the second variable band-<br>
pass filter 808. The phase of the signal from the second port is rotated by 90<br>
degrees in the first phase rotator 812. After passing through the first variable<br>
band-pass filter 806, the signal from the first phase rotator 812 is phase-rotated<br>
by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 808 and then output to the sixth port of<br>
the second magic T 804. Hence, the signals received in the second magic T 804<br>
through the sixth and seventh ports have the same phase. The second magic T<br>
804 combines these signals and outputs the combined signal through the eighth<br>
port. The signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
The second magic T 804 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>
eighth port and distributes the signal to the sixth and seventh ports, with the<br>
same phase. The signal from the seventh port is fully reflected from the second<br>
variable band-pass filter 808 and fed back to the seventh port. The signal from<br>
the sixth port of the second magic T 804 is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the<br>
second phase rotator 814, reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 806,<br>
phase-rotated again by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 814, and then<br>
provided to the sixth port of the second magic T 804. Thus, the second magic T<br>
804 receives the signals with a phase difference of 180 degrees through the sixth<br>
and seventh ports, combines them, and outputs the combined signal through the<br>
fifth port. The signal from the fifth port passes through the fourth duplexer 822<br>
and is distributed as two signals in the distributor 824. One of the distributed<br>
signals is provided to the subsystem 26 and the other is provided to the fourth<br>
port of the first magic T 802 through the reception filter 826. The first magic T<br>
802 distributes the signal received through the fourth port to the second and third<br>
ports, with the same phase. The signal from the third port is fully reflected from<br>
the second variable band-pass filter 808 and fed back to the third port. Although<br><br>
the signal from the second port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the first phase<br>
rotator 812, it is also reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 806, phase-<br>
rotated again by 90 degrees in the first phase rotator 812, and then provided to<br>
the second port of the first magic T 802. Thus, the first magic T 802 receives the<br>
signals with a phase difference of 180 degrees through the second and third ports,<br>
combines them, and outputs the combined signal through the first port. The<br>
signal from the first port passes through the third duplexer 222 and is provided<br>
to the receiver of the main system 22 through the third duplexer 222.<br><transmission in subsystem><br>
The transmission signal TX2 from the subsystem 26 passes through the<br>
fourth duplexer 822 and is provided to the fifth port of the second magic T 804.<br>
The second magic T 804 distributes the received signal to the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The signal from the seventh port is<br>
fully reflected from the second variable band-pass filter 808 and fed back to the<br>
seventh port. While the signal from the sixth port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees<br>
in the second phase rotator 814, it is also fully reflected from the first variable<br>
band-pass filter 806, again phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase<br>
rotator 814, and fed back to the sixth port. Thus, the second magic T 804<br>
receives the signals with the same phase through the sixth and seventh ports,<br>
combines them, and outputs the combined signal through the eighth port. This<br>
signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in subsystem><br>
The second magic T 804 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>
eighth port and distributes the received signal to the sixth and seventh ports, with<br>
the same phase. The signal from the seventh port is fully reflected from the<br>
second variable band-pass filter 808 and fed back to the seventh port. While the<br>
signal from the sixth port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase<br>
rotator 814, it is also fully reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 806,<br>
again phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 814, and fed back<br>
to the sixth port. Thus, the second magic T 804 receives the signals with a phase<br>
difference of 180 degrees through the sixth and seventh ports, combines them,<br><br>
and outputs the combined signal through the fifth port. This signal from the fifth<br>
port is provided to the distributor 824 through the fourth duplexer 822. The<br>
distributor 824 distributes the received signal and outputs one of two distributed<br>
signals to the receiver of the subsystem 26.<br>
Meanwhile, no reflection occurs theoretically during outputting the<br>
transmission signal Txl from the main system 22 through the first magic T 802.<br>
In practice, however, some of the transmission signal Txl is output through the<br>
fourth port, although it is slight. To prevent this problem, a circulator 828 can be<br>
further provided between the reception filter 826 and the fourth port of the first<br>
magic T 802, for isolation, as illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
The use of the first and second variable band-pass filters 806 and 808,<br>
instead of frequency band-fixed filters, enables addition of a subsystem to a<br>
main system through frequency band division.<br>

apparatus according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to<br>
FIG. 10, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 90 is so configured as<br>
to share an antenna between the main system 22 with the third duplexer 222 and<br>
the subsystem 26. The BS sharing apparatus 90 includes a first magic T 902 for<br>

fourth port to third and fourth ports, with the same phase and distributing a<br>

for receiving the signal from the third port of the first magic T 902 and rotating<br>
the phase of the received signal, a second variable band-pass filter 908 for<br>
filtering the signal received from the first phase rotator 912, a first variable<br>
band-pass filter 906 for filtering the signal received from the second port of the<br>
first magic T, a second phase rotator 914 for rotating the signal received from the<br>
first variable band-pass filter 906, a second magic T 904 for receiving the signals<br>
from the second phase rotator 914 and the second variable band-pass filter 908<br>
through sixth and seventh ports, respectively and combining the signals, a fourth<br>
duplexer 922 connected between a fifth port of the second magic T 904 and the<br><br>
subsystem 26, a distributor 924 connected between a receiver Rx of the fourth<br>
duplexer 922 and the subsystem 26, for distributing a signal received from the<br>
receiver Rx of the fourth duplexer 922, and a reception filter 926 for filtering a<br>
distributed signal received from the distributor 924 and applying the filtered<br>
signal to the first port of the first magic T 902.<br>
The antenna is connected to an eighth port of the second magic T 904.<br>
The receivers Rx of the third and fourth duplexers 222 and 922, and the<br>
reception filter 926 can be implemented by reception filters that pass no<br>
reception frequencies of the main system 22 and the subsystem 26, or full-band<br>
filters that pass the reception frequency bands of the main system 22 and the<br>
subsystem 26 in a particular band (e.g. PCS band). The first and second variable<br>
band-pass filters 906 and 908 pass only the transmission frequency band of the<br>
main system 22. If the main system 22 is exchanged with the subsystem 26 in<br>
position, the first and second variable band-pass filters 906 and 908 may pass<br>
only the transmission and reception frequency bands of the subsystem 26. If a<br>
filter such as the fourth duplexer 922 already exists in the subsystem 26, the<br>
fourth duplexer 922 may not be provided.<br>
The operations of the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus will<br>
be described below.<br><transmission in main system><br>
The transmission signal TXl from the main system 22 is provided to the<br>
fourth port of the first magic T 902 through the third duplexer 222. The first<br>
magic T 902 distributes the received signal to the second and third ports, with<br>
the same phase. The signal from the third port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in<br>
the first phase rotator 912 and provided to the seventh port of the second magic<br>
T 904 through the second variable band-pass filter 908. After passing through<br>
the first variable band-pass filter 906, the signal from the second port is phase-<br>
rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 914 and then provided to the<br>
sixth port of the second magic T 904. Hence, the signals received in the second<br>
magic T 904 through the sixth and seventh ports have the same phase. The<br><br>
second magic T 904 combines these signals and outputs the combined signal<br>
through the eighth port. The signal from the eighth port is radiated through the<br>
antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
The second magic T 04 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>
eighth port and distributes the signal to the sixth and seventh ports, with the<br>
same phase. The signal from the seventh port is fully reflected from the second<br>
variable band-pass filter 908 and fed back to the seventh port. The signal from<br>
the sixth port of the second magic T 904 is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the<br>
second phase rotator 914, reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 906,<br>
phase-rotated again by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 914, thus phase-<br>
rotated by 180 degrees in total and then provided to the sixth port of the second<br>
magic T 904. Thus, the second magic T 804 receives the signals with a phase<br>
difference of 180 degrees through the sixth and seventh ports, combines them,<br>
and outputs the combined signal through the fifth port. The signal from the fifth<br>
port passes through the fourth duplexer 922 and is distributed as two signals in<br>
the distributor 924. One of the distributed signals is provided to the subsystem<br>
26 and the other is provided to the first port of the first magic T 902 through the<br>
reception filter 926. The first magic T 902 distributes the signal received through<br>
the first port to the second and third ports, with a phase difference of 180 degrees.<br>
The signal from the second port is fully reflected from the first variable band-<br>
pass filter 906 and fed back to the second port. Although the signal from the<br>
third port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the first phase rotator 912, it is also<br>
reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 906, phase-rotated again by 90<br>
degrees in the first phase rotator 912, and then provided to the second port of the<br>
first magic T 802. Thus, the first magic T 902 receives the signals with the same<br>
phase through the second and third ports, combines them, and outputs the<br>
combined signal through the fourth port. The signal from the fourth port passes<br>
through the third duplexer 222 and is provided to the receiver of the main system<br>
22 through the third duplexer 222.<br><transmission in subsystem><br><br>
The transmission signal TX2 from the subsystem 26 passes through the<br>
fourth duplexer 922 and is provided to the fifth port of the second magic T 904.<br>
The second magic T 904 distributes the received signal to the sixth and seventh<br>
ports, with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The signal from the seventh port is<br>
fully reflected from the second variable band-pass filter 908 and fed back to the<br>

receives the signals with the same phase through the sixth and seventh ports,<br>
combines them, and outputs the combined signal through the eighth port. This<br>
signal from the eighth port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in subsystem><br>
The second magic T 904 receives a signal from the antenna through the<br>

signal from the sixth port is phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase<br>
rotator 914, it is also fully reflected from the first variable band-pass filter 906,<br>
again phase-rotated by 90 degrees in the second phase rotator 914, and fed back<br>
to the sixth port. Thus, the second magic T 904 receives the signals with a phase<br>
difference of 180 degrees through the sixth and seventh ports, combines them,<br>
and outputs the combined signal through the fifth port. This signal from the fifth<br>
port is provided to the distributor 924 through the fourth duplexer 922. The<br>
distributor 924 distributes the received signal and outputs one of two distributed<br>
signals to the receiver of the subsystem 26.<br>
Meanwhile, no reflection occurs theoretically during outputting the<br>
transmission signal Txl from the main system 22 through the first magic T 902.<br>
In practice, however, some of the transmission signal Txl is output through the<br>
fourth port, although it is slight. To prevent this problem, a circulator 928 can be<br>
further provided between the reception filter 926 and the fourth port of the first<br><br>
magic T 902, for isolation, as illustrated in FIG. 11.<br>
The use of the first and second variable band-pass filters 906 and 908,<br>
instead of frequency band-fixed filters, enables addition of a subsystem to a<br>
main system through frequency band division.<br>
FIG. 13 is a block diagram of a wireless communication BS sharing<br>
apparatus according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. The wireless<br>
communication BS sharing apparatus illustrated in FIG. 13 may not have a<br>
duplexer in either the main system 28 or the subsystem 26. Since the service<br>
frequency band of a BS system is separated and allocated to the main system 28<br>
and the subsystem 26 according to the present invention, the basic service<br>
frequency band is identical to the main system 28 and the subsystem 26.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, a wireless communication BS sharing apparatus 70<br>
is so configured as to share an antenna between the main system 28 and the<br>
subsystem 26.<br>
This BS sharing apparatus 70 includes a first hybrid coupler 702 for<br>
distributing a transmission signal received from the main system 28 through a<br>
first port and outputting the distributed signals with different phases, a first<br>
variable band-pass filter 706 for filtering a signal received from a second port of<br>
the first hybrid coupler 702, a second variable band-pass filter 708 for filtering a<br>
signal received from a third port of the first hybrid coupler 702, a second hybrid<br>
coupler 704 for receiving signals from the first and second variable band-pass<br>
filters 706 and 708 through sixth and seventh ports, combining the signals,<br>
outputting the combined signal through an eighth port, and receiving a<br>
transmission signal from the subsystem 26 through a fifth port, a duplexer 722<br>
whose transmitter Tx is connected to the eighth port of the second hybrid<br>
coupler 704, for transmitting the transmission signal from the transmitter Tx to<br>
an antenna, and a distributor 724 for distributing a signal received from a<br>
receiver Rx of the duplexer 722 to the main system 28 and the subsystem 26.<br><br>
The operations of the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus will<br>
be described below.<br><transmission in main system><br>
The first hybrid coupler 702 receives through the first port the<br>
transmission signal Tx from the main system 28 and distributes the received<br>
signal to the second and third ports, its phase being rotated by 90 degrees and<br>
180 degrees, respectively for the second and third ports. Thus, the distributed<br>
signals have a phase difference of 90 degrees.<br>
The signals from the second and third ports pass through the first and<br>
second variable band-pass filters 706 and 708 that pass only the transmission<br>
signal Tx of the main system 28 and are provided to the sixth and seventh ports<br>
of the second hybrid coupler 704.<br>
The second hybrid coupler 704 combines the received signals and<br>
outputs the combined signal through the eighth port. This signal from the eighth<br>
port is radiated through the antenna.<br><reception in main system><br>
A signal received through the antenna is filtered in the receiver Rx of the<br>
duplexer 722. The distributor 724 distributes the filtered signal. One of the<br>
distributed signals is provided to the subsystem 26 and the other is provided to<br>
the main system 28. Thus the signal is received at the main system 28.<br><transmission in subsystem><br>
A transmission signal Tx from the subsystem 26 is provided to the<br>
second hybrid coupler 704 through the fifth port.<br>
The second hybrid coupler 704 distributes the received signal to the<br>
sixth and seventh ports, its phase being rotated by 90 degrees and 180 degrees,<br>
respectively for the sixth and seventh ports. Thus, the distributed signals have a<br>
phase difference of 90 degrees.<br><br>
The signals from the sixth and seventh ports are fully reflected from the<br>
first and second variable band-pass filters 706 and 708 and fed back to the sixth<br>
and seventh ports.<br>
The feedback signals are combined and output through the eighth port.<br>
The signal from the eighth filter is radiated through the antenna after passing<br>
through the duplexer 722.<br><reception in subsystems></reception>
A signal received through the antenna is filtered in the receiver Rx of the<br>
duplexer 722. The distributor 724 distributes the filtered signal. One of the<br>
distributed signals is provided to the subsystem 26. Thus the signal is received at<br>
the subsystem 26.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, they are merely exemplary applications.<br>
For example, while the first and second variable duplexers, and the first<br>
and second variable band-pass filters are used for variable filtering of the<br>
transmission and/or reception frequency band, they can be replaced with Low<br>
Pass Filters (LPFs) and/or High Pass Filters (HPFs), or their combinations.<br>
While for the purpose of increasing filtering performance, the BS<br>
sharing apparatuses illustrated in FIGs. 6 to 11 are so configured that the<br>
distributors 624, 824, 924 are connected between the receivers Rx of the fourth<br>
duplexers 622, 822 and 922 and the subsystem 26, distribute a signal from the<br>
receivers Rx, and provide one of the distributed signals as a received signal for<br>
the main system 22, it can be further contemplated that one of the distributed<br>
signals is directly provided to the third duplexer 322 of the main system 22<br>
without passing through the reception filters 626, 826 and 926.<br>
Also, while the BS sharing apparatus illustrated in FIG. 13 adopts hybrid<br>
couplers, the hybrid couplers can be replaced with magic Ts as in the second<br><br>
embodiment.<br>
Besides the above modifications, many other modifications in form and<br>
details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus<br>
according to the present invention enables a main BS system and a sub-BS<br>
system with a different frequency band added to the main BS system to easily<br>
share an antenna and a feeder cable.<br>
Irrespective of the frequency band of the subsystem, the antenna and the<br>
feeder cable can be shared.<br>
The wireless communication BS sharing system can be simply<br>
implemented even for a plurality of subsystems.<br>
It can cope regardless of the frequency bands of the main system and the<br>
subsystem.<br>
Also in the wireless communication BS sharing apparatus, a given<br>
frequency band is separated and allocated to different operation systems.<br>
Particularly when a frequency-variable filter is used, one model is<br>
sufficient for a variety of frequency combinations. Thus, different models need<br>
not be developed.<br>
In addition, products can be delivered in a short time, management cost<br>
is saved because many models need not be fabricated, and mass production is<br>
enabled, thereby reducing fabrication cost.<br><br>
Since frequency band can be changed while the wireless communication<br>
BS sharing apparatus is operated, an immediate action can be taken against<br>
changes between service providers or local frequency changes. As compared to<br>
the conventional technology, uninstallation and reinstallation are not required,<br>
thereby saving cost.<br><br>
