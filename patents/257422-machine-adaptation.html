				<td>MACHINE ADAPTATION<br>
This invention relates to the transmission of power<br>
and/or data within a machine e.g. a machine tool, and<br>
relates particularly, but not exclusively, to apparatus<br>
for the supply of power to and data communication with<br>
an electrical accessory e.g. a measurement probe<br>
mounted on the machine spindle.<br>
When an electrical accessory like a measurement probe<br>
is located in a machine tool spindle, normally used for<br>
cutters, it becomes difficult to supply that accessory<br>
with power and to provide a signal path to and/or from<br>
that accessory. Batteries have a limited life,<br>
particularly when wireless transmission of large<br>
amounts of probing data to a remote receiver takes<br>
place. Also it is undesirable to have extra power<br>
supply or data transmission parts fitted around the<br>
machine's spindle because these parts can interfere<br>
with cutters subsequently located in the spindle, or<br>
these parts may collide with a workpiece or automatic<br>
cutter changer mechanism.<br>
One example of a machine which includes parts fitted<br>
around the spindle for supplying power to and signal<br>
transmission from the machine is shown in US Patent No.<br>
4,339,714. Other similar devices are shown in US<br>
Patent Nos .5, 791,836 and 4 , 536, 661.<br>
An arrangement for providing a signal path within a<br>
machine tool is disclosed in US 5109223. The disclosure<br>
shows a machine tool body having a signal path to a<br>
rotatable spindle in the form of a first inductive<br>
link. Also shown is a second inductive link between the<br>
spindle and a measurement probe across the widest<br>
portion tapered shank (5). A probe is mounted to the<br>
shank.<br>
The arrangement of the second link in that patent is<br>
not suited to modern machine tools because the wide<br>
area at the base of the taper is highly stressed when<br>
cutters are being used, due to e.g. high cutter side<br>
loading and high spindle speeds.The position of this<br>
second link means that it is likely to be knocked by<br>
cutter shanks being inserted and removed from the shank<br>
holder. Thus it would be difficult for a machine tool<br>
manufacturer to successfully adapt his existing machine<br>
design to incorporate the arrangement illustrated.<br>
Likewise a new design would require additional<br>
strengthening to compensate for the weakness created by<br>
the second inductive link illustrated.<br>
Furthermore the links will not transmit enough power if<br>
they are too small. So it seems that it is a necessity<br>
to position the second link at the larger end of the<br>
tapered shank in order to maximise its size. Moreover,<br>
use on small tool shanks (30mm diameter or less say)<br>
would not be a practical proposition because the link<br>
at the shank would be far too small to transmit enough<br>
power.<br>
For an inductive link to function effectively the<br>
ferrite elements mentioned in US 5109223 should not be<br>
separated by magnetisable material (e.g. the metal<br>
surface of the shank). Consequently an interruption in<br>
the surface of the shank would have to be made at the<br>
link on the shank for effective operation. Such an<br>
interruption would have to be sealed. Sealing of<br>
non-metallic parts to metallic parts is very difficult<br>
in the machine tool operating environment at the<br>
stressed position indicated in Figure 1 of US Patent<br>
No. 5,109,223.<br>
The arrangement of Fig 1 in that document requires<br>
relative orientation between the tool shank and the<br>
spindle. Such orientation is not always possible on<br>
machine tools. The arrangement of Fig 2 requires an<br>
annular recess in the shank at the aforementioned<br>
highly stressed location.<br>
The transmission of power to the probe is not<br>
contemplated in US 5109223.<br>
Embodiments shown in International Patent Application<br>
No. PCT/GB2003/001677 address the above problems but do<br>
not show the following.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a<br>
machine tool accessory including a shank for releasably<br>
attaching the accessory to a spindle of a machine tool,<br>
the shank being attachable to the spindle in a<br>
plurality of orientations and having electrical<br>
contacts for electrical communication with<br>
complementary electrical contacts at the spindle, the<br>
accessory further including a circuit for determining<br>
the orientation of the contacts of the shank relative<br>
to complementary contacts at the spindle.<br>
In this description an electrical contact is any part<br>
which provides physical conductive contact and thus<br>
produces a conductive path across a link for<br>
electricity. The first link is described as the first<br>
element in the description and the second link is<br>
described as the third element.<br>
The invention extends to a machine tool shank for<br>
releasably mounting a machine tool cutter or other<br>
machine tool accessory to the spindle of a machine tool<br>
comprising a portion of an electrical link in the form<br>
of a plurality of electrical contacts arranged such<br>
that each is connectable to any one of a plurality of<br>
complementary contacts at a shank receiving area of the<br>
spindle.<br>
The invention extends a machine tool comprising a<br>
stationary part, a spindle having a shank receiving<br>
area, a shank releasably acceptable to the shank<br>
receiving area in any orientation or a plurality of<br>
orientations, relative to the spindle, and a machine<br>
tool accessory attached to the shank, and comprising a<br>
first electrical link between the stationary part and<br>
the spindle and a second electrical link at the shank<br>
receiving area being in electrical communication with<br>
the first link for providing in use a disconnectable<br>
electrical link between the spindle, the shank for<br>
providing power or a signal for the accessory, wherein<br>
the second link is formed as two portions, one portion<br>
being mounted to the spindle the other portion being<br>
mounted to the shank, wherein each portion has a<br>
plurality of complementary contacts for electrical<br>
communication between the two portions, and a circuit<br>
for determining which of the plurality of electrical<br>
contacts of the one portion is connected to which of<br>
the plurality of electrical contacts of the other<br>
portion.<br>
The invention extends also to a measurement probe<br>
adapted for use with the machine tool or shank<br>
mentioned above.<br>
Preferably the links mentioned above are used to supply<br>
power to the accessory. Preferably the links are used<br>
to transmit signals to and/or from the accessory.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to<br>
the drawings, wherein:<br>

Referring to Fig 1, part of a machine tool 200 is shown<br>
having a spindle 210 driven directly by motor 220. A<br>
cavity or shank receiving area in the form of a tapered<br>
housing 230 in the spindle 210 is used to hold a cutter<br>
or, as in this illustration, a measurement probe 100.<br>
Modern machine tools have automatic cutter changers.<br>
Other accessories can be used also in place of a<br>
cutter. All will be mounted on a standard tool shank<br>
360. Most standard tool shanks are of tapered (frustum)<br>
configuration. With this invention a carousel of<br>
cutters together with one or more accessories will be<br>
used and selection of the correct cutter/accessory will<br>
be made by a program. When a measurement operation is<br>
to be performed then an accessory in the form of a<br>
measurement probe will be selected from the carousel<br>
and automatically fitted into the spindle. The machine<br>
can be moved into the desired location and the<br>
workpiece can be measured, either by translational<br>
movement of the spindle or (if the probe itself can<br>
move) by keeping the spindle stationary and<br>
manipulating the probe.<br>
In order to provide power and a signal path to the<br>
measurement probe 100 or other accessory on the machine<br>
tool 200 via rotary components (in this case a<br>
continuously rotatable spindle 210) three elements are<br>
required. The first element is an electrical link<br>
between the stationary machine 200 and the spindle 210<br>
for providing power and/or signal connections across a<br>
rotary interface, the second is a path along the<br>
spindle 210, and the third element is a disconnectable<br>
electrical link from the spindle to the probe 100 or<br>
other accessory at the shank receiving area 230.<br>
There are a number of positions at which this first<br>
element (variants of which are described in detail<br>
below) may be positioned, examples of which are shown<br>
in Fig 1 as circled references la,lb,lc and 1d.<br>
Position la has been illustrated schematically in<br>
chain-dotted lines and provides a rotary link giving a<br>
signal path S, power supply P and (in this instance) a<br>
chassis return E.<br>
Reference 1b shows another possible position for the<br>
first element. In position 1b it is likely that the<br>
link between the machine and its spindle will be formed<br>
within, the motor 220 and take the form of a stator and<br>
rotor coil as described below.<br>
References 1c and 1d show other possible positions for<br>
the first element which may take the form of any of the<br>
links described below with the benefit of complete<br>
enclosure.<br>
Reference 2 indicates the second element i.e. the power<br>
and signal path along the spindle joining the first and<br>
third elements. Alternative embodiments for this part<br>
are described below.<br>
Reference 3 likewise indicates the position of the<br>
third element i.e. the link between the spindle 210 and<br>
probe 100 or other accessory. Alternatives for this<br>
part are described below also.<br>
Figs 2-11 show various ways of providing power and<br>
signal links from the static machine 200 to a rotating<br>
part, in this case spindle 210.<br>
Fig 2 shows a slip ring arrangement having two rings<br>
222 and two wipers 225, one supplying power combined<br>
with a signal (P+S) and one forming a common return E.<br>
The power and signal supply is intended to be<br>
transmitted via an insulated path I along the spindle<br>
and the common return E is formed by the remainder of<br>
the spindle. Three or more slip rings could be used<br>
e.g. for separate power and signal paths.<br>
Fig 3 shows another machine to spindle link in the form<br>
of an inductive rotary transformer. In this variant an<br>
alternating current is passed through static<br>
transformer windings 235 and is picked up by rotary<br>
coil 230. One set of windings only is used in this<br>
arrangement but more may be used e.g. a pair of sets.<br>
In the present arrangement the power and signal P and S<br>
are combined in one alternating current sent to<br>
accessory 100 via insulated spindle track I, and<br>
returned via spindle path E. This rotary transformer<br>
is more robust when very high spindle speeds are used<br>
e.g. 50,000 rpm, because the coils of the transformer<br>
will be pushed centrifugally against side walls 250 in<br>
use. These walls will support the coils during<br>
rotation.<br>
Fig 4 shows another machine to spindle link in the form<br>
of a single coil rotary transformer which has an<br>
axially spaced stator 245 and rotor 240. This<br>
arrangement operates in a similar manner to the rotary<br>
transformer shown in Fig 3.<br>
Fig 5 shows a machine to spindle inductive link in the<br>
form of a multiple coil rotary transformer having<br>
rotary and stationary parts 252 and 253 respectively.<br>
In use a separate power and signal path can be<br>
utilised, in which case two insulated paths IP and IS<br>
will be required on the spindle. A common spindle<br>
return E is used here.<br>
Fig 6 shows another machine to spindle link this<br>
variant employs a rotary transformer having a stator<br>
265 and a rotor 260 in combination with a capacitance<br>
link which likewise has a stator part 275 and a rotor<br>
part 270. A signal S is passed via the capacitance<br>
link and power is supplied via the rotary transformer.<br>
The spindle has two insulated paths IS and IP and a<br>
common return E.<br>
Fig 7 shows a machine to spindle link which is solely<br>
capacitive. A stator 290 is shown and a rotor 295. In<br>
this example there is a power path P-IP and a separate<br>
signal path S-IS as well as a common return E. The<br>
power path will have to have a relatively high<br>
capacitance and so the surface area of the capacitive<br>
plates 280 should be larger in comparison to the area<br>
of the signal path plates 285.<br>
Fig 8 shows another capacitive machine to spindle link.<br>
This variant has radially extending plates 297/300 to<br>
provide more surface area than might be achievable with<br>
the circumferentially extending plates illustrated in<br>
Figs 6 and 7. This example functions in the same<br>
manner as the capacitive link shown in Fig 7 and<br>
described above. Shown is a stator 297 and a rotor 300.<br>
Fig 9 shows yet another machine to spindle link. In<br>
this example a rotary transformer 310 is used for power<br>
transmission. A signal path IS is provided by an<br>
optical fibre 315 in the spindle co-operating with an<br>
optical machine module (OMM). The signal path in the<br>
spindle is via the optical fibre 315 which rotates in<br>
use. A small gap for light to cross is present between<br>
static OMM and rotary parts of the spindle. Thus a<br>
rotary link is formed for a signal. An optical<br>
transceiver in the spindle or accessory may be provided<br>
for two-way communication along the fibre 315.<br>
Figs 10 and 11 show examples of optical fibre to OMM<br>
links. Fig 10 shows a fibre 315 which can transmit<br>
and/or receive data via a static axial emitter/sensor<br>
320. Fig Ha shows a y-shaped fibre 315 which can<br>
transmit and/or receive data via a ring of static<br>
emitters/sensors 325 disposed circumferentially about<br>
the ends of the y-shaped fibre 315. Fig 11b shows a<br>
fibre 315 merging into a disk 316 which again can<br>
transmit and/or receive data via a ring of static<br>
emitters/sensors 325.<br>
The electrical link shown in Fig 2 is a contact link<br>
whereas the electrical links shown in Figs 3-llb are<br>
all non-contact links.<br>
Figs 12 and 13 illustrate examples of the second<br>
element and show sections through spindle 210, having a<br>
draw-bar bore 330. Each Figure shows two insulated<br>
paths IS and IP for signal and power respectively, as<br>
well as a common return E formed by the remainder of<br>
the spindle. Two wires are used in these examples for<br>
dynamic balancing of the spindle. A combined signal<br>
and power path might be used so one wire only would<br>
then be required. A counterweight or asymmetric<br>
section might be used to provide a balanced shaft if<br>
only one wire was present. Shown are two insulated<br>
wires but more than two wires may be used.<br>
Alternatively or additionally one or more optical<br>
fibres may form the required signal path. Optical<br>
fibres may be omitted entirely, so a straight line<br>
light path may be provided between the machine to<br>
spindle link and the electrical device.<br>
The electrical paths IS and IP may be formed by any<br>
distinct conductive path e.g. by flexible conductive<br>
strips possibly in a groove or grooves, or curled up<br>
inside the central draw-bar bore 330. The power and<br>
signal paths may be formed by an insulated draw-bar, a<br>
discrete strip of conductive plating formed on the<br>
spindle or draw-bar, or concentric insulated tubes<br>
within the spindle or within the draw-bar.<br>
Fig 14a shows an example of a third element of the<br>
invention i.e. the disconnectable link between the<br>
spindle and the electrical device.<br>
Probe 100 is attached to the shank 360 which is<br>
insertable (usually automatically) into a shank<br>
receiving area, in the form of a tapered housing 230 in<br>
the end of the spindle 210. Conductive tracks 24 and"<br>
22 provide paths for power to and signals to/from the<br>
probe 100. The tracks are electrically insulated from<br>
their surroundings.<br>
When the shank is inserted into the housing 230 sprung<br>
pins 340 on the shank make contact with the tracks and<br>
provide the paths for power and signal to the probe.<br>
Pins 340 too are insulated from their supporting<br>
surroundings. The pins are adjacent the housing 230.<br>
Fig 14b shows an alternative arrangement of tracks<br>
22/24 and pins 340. In this case three pins 340 are<br>
provided for each track 22/24.<br>
Fig 15 shows the supply circuits to the tracks 24 and<br>
22. These circuits are shown in more detail in Fig 18.<br>
The circuits may be powered from the contacts 22/24.<br>
Now, if control of the orientation of the shank<br>
relative to the spindle is not possible or the shank is<br>
orientatable to two or more positions at random, then<br>
the position of the pins relative to the tracks will be<br>
unknown or uncertain. To overcome this problem pins<br>
340 are connected to a circuit 360 which will determine<br>
which pins are connected to which tracks. The circuit<br>
will then switch the pins to supply the correct probe<br>
circuits.<br>
Each pin is connected to a multi-way controlled switch<br>
350 (i.e. switch 1,2,3 or 4) in this instance solid<br>
state switches, having a test position T and, in this<br>
case, four other positions, two for supplying power<br>
P1,P2 and two for a signal path S1,S2. The circuit 360<br>
includes a controller, in this instance a<br>
microprocessor, which controls the switches 350 and<br>
sets each switch 350 to the initial test position T.<br>
In this position a supply of alternating current via<br>
tracks 24 will produce a half-wave voltage increase<br>
across two of the resistors R1,R2,R3 or R4 on alternate<br>
half cycles. The voltage V across each of the<br>
resistors is monitored by the microprocessor. The<br>
microprocessor switches a first of the switches 1,2,3<br>
or 4 to the P1 position if its corresponding resistor<br>
R1,R2,R3 or R4 has a voltage across it. Likewise the<br>
microprocessor switches a second of the switches 1,2,3<br>
or 4 to the P2 position if its corresponding resistor<br>
R1,R2,R3 or R4 has a voltage across it.<br>
The microprocessor can then switch the remaining two<br>
switches to positions SI and 52.<br>
Fig 16 shows a simplified probe circuit in which the<br>
switches 350 have been switched correctly by the<br>
microprocessor. A load circuit 380 is fed by switches<br>
1 and 2 and a signal path is provided via switches 3<br>
and 4 to a transmitter and receiver circuit 390. In<br>
Fig 15 it will be noted that the electrical connections<br>
24 and 21 are each shown side by side. However, if<br>
they were diagonally opposed there would be no need to<br>
have a circuit to determine the orientation of the<br>
contacts because the contacts would come together such<br>
that the orientation is not important.<br>
Fig 17a and 17b show a refinement of the apparatus of<br>
Figs 15 and 16. Since it may be possible for one or<br>
more of the pins 340 shown in Figs 15 and 16 to fall<br>
into a gap 400 between the tracks 24 e.g. as shown in<br>
Fig 17b then it is better to have five pins 340 1,2,3,4<br>
and 5 as shown in Figs 11a and 17b. Then, at least one<br>
pin 340 will be in contact with each track1 24/22<br>
irrespective of the orientation of the shank 360<br>
relative to the housing 230.<br>
In this refinement the operation of circuit 360 will<br>
have to be modified. The circuit will determine which<br>
pins are connected to the power supply as before. The<br>
microprocessor can then determine which pins have<br>
impedance equal to that of the transformer coil 55<br>
between them (indicating connection to the signal path<br>
S), which pins have a short between them (indicating<br>
two pins on the same track) and which pins are open<br>
circuit (indicating no connection-pin in gap 400).<br>
Then the microprocessor can switch the switches 350<br>
correctly so the appropriate connections are made to<br>
the circuits 380 and 390. The technique described<br>
immediately above will work for a plurality of tracks<br>
and a plurality of pins. The numbers of tracks and<br>
pins need not be the same.<br>
Figs 14-17 show sprung pins 340 on a shank 360 and<br>
tracks 24/22 on a spindle 210. The position of the<br>
pins and tracks could be reversed. Any type of<br>
electrical contact could be used in place of the pins<br>
and tracks illustrated. Any suitable number of tracks<br>
and pins etc could be employed but for simplicity two<br>
for power and/or two for signal are preferred on the<br>
spindle, mating with five pins or tracks etc mounted on<br>
the shank.<br>
Figure 18 is a schematic representation of the<br>
electrical principle used in the apparatus illustrated<br>
in Figs 14 to 17b. Two inductive links are used to<br>
provide communication between the static housing and<br>
the rotating parts of the spindle, one for power and<br>
one for signalling (the first element). Shown also are<br>
two contact sets 21/22, 24/25 for communication between<br>
the spindle and the shank. Rotatable parts of the link<br>
are shown within the area bounded by the dotted line.<br>
Each inductive link is formed by a closely spaced pair<br>
of annular rings 40/50 (Fig 18), in this case ferrite<br>
rings, each of which has a conductor coil 45/55<br>
associated therewith. The ferrite rings and coils<br>
together form the non-contact inductive link between<br>
the stationary machine 200 and the spindle 210. The<br>
ferrite rings and coils may rotate relative to each<br>
other. In this embodiment the two sets of ferrite<br>
rings/coils have different diameters DP &amp; DS so one set<br>
can be positioned within the other. This means that<br>
space in the axial direction of the machine can be<br>
conserved. The separation between inductive elements<br>
has been shown as cylindrical about the rotation axis<br>
of the spindle. However separation in a plane<br>
perpendicular to the axis is possible.<br>
The contacts illustrated above have to operate in a<br>
hostile environment. For example, machine coolant is<br>
used and is often forced through the centre of the<br>
spindle 330 (Fig 1). This coolant causes electrical<br>
contact problems at the contacts. In order to<br>
alleviate this problem a seal may be provided.<br>
Fig 19 shows a taper shank known as a BT40 shank.<br>
Contacts 22 and 24 are arranged around the shank 360.<br>
Seal 362 fitted adjacent contacts 340 prevents coolant<br>
from the spindle centre 330 from leaking onto contacts<br>
22/24/340. The seal becomes operative when the shank<br>
360 is inserted into the spindle cavity 230. In an<br>
alternative arrangement the seal 362 may be fitted to<br>
the shank 360.<br>
The advantages of supplying power and/or providing a<br>
signal path to a measurement probe via the machine to<br>
which it is mounted are:<br>
that: little or no internal power is required in<br>
the probe;<br>
a lack of a battery compartment and transmission<br>
module enables the probe to be more compact;<br>
an operator is not required to change batteries;<br>
the contact, inductive or capacitive signal links<br>
described are less likely to suffer external<br>
interference than radio or light data transmission<br>
systems used outside the machine's spindle; and<br>
since no parts external to the machine are used<br>
then, when the probe is not in use, there are no<br>
residual parts to interfere with the other operations<br>
of the machine.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference<br>
to its application to a machine tool and measurement<br>
probe, it has many other applications and so is not<br>
intended to be limited to this field. For example the<br>
invention may find use in any machine which is adapted<br>
to accept an electrical device at a rotary machine part<br>
and which is capable of supplying power or a signal<br>
path to or from the device.<br>
Examples of accessories other than probes that may be<br>
used with the rotary part described include: a robotic<br>
gripper or workpiece manipulator; a laser deburring<br>
tool (possibly articulatable); a laser<br>
driller/profiler/engraver/surface hardener; a camera<br>
e.g. for measuring surface finish or for monitoring<br>
tool breakage; adjustable size tooling, workplace<br>
cleaners (e.g. vacuum cleaners); electromagnets; high<br>
speed motors (e.g. for deburring use) or a tool having<br>
supplemental equipment, such as wear, deflection,<br>
breakage, identification, usage recording devices, or<br>
temperature, cutting torque or vibration sensing.<br>
Examples of different probes that might be used<br>
include: scanning probes e.g.. analogue probes or data<br>
streaming probes; touch trigger probes; non-contact<br>
probes e.g. camera or laser probes or surface texture<br>
probes. Additionally probes could be articulated by<br>
mounting a movable probe head to the shank mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The accessory may include data storage and the data may<br>
be read or rewritten. Data stored could include<br>
identification and, where a tool and supplemental<br>
equipment is used, tool geometry or usage information.<br>
The description and claims refer to a shank. Herein<br>
the word shank is intended to embrace any coupling<br>
(e.g. male or female) which is suitable for removable<br>
coupling of a rotatable part of a machine to an<br>
accessory.<br>
There are presently several standard tool shank designs<br>
i.e. the part of the tool which fits into the end of a<br>
machine tool's spindle. The probe 100 shown in Figs<br>
1&amp;14-23 illustrates only two types of shank (HSK &amp;<br>
BT40). As a consequence any accessory used in place of<br>
the tool e.g. a probe, may require several different<br>
shanks to fit all the machines which have spindles<br>
adapted to supply power or to carry a signal. Thus a<br>
feature of this invention is the shank itself, i.e.<br>
coupling between the accessory and the rotatable part<br>
of the machine which, whilst illustrated as being a<br>
shank integral with the probe in some Figs may be a<br>
separate item which is selectable from a number of<br>
designs to suit the machine on which the accessory is<br>
to be used, but which will have the ability to transmit<br>
power to the accessory and/or will provide a signal<br>
path The shanks described herein and illustrated are<br>
intended to fit to a machine in use. However they may<br>
also be employed off the machine. For example the<br>
contacts on the shank may be used to provide preheating<br>
current for keeping a measurement probe or the<br>
like warm whilst it is" off the machine, so that no<br>
thermally-induced errors in measurement occur. Another<br>
example is the uploading of tool data into a tool via.<br>
the contacts e.g. geometry, tool set information,<br>
expected usage, number of teeth etc., before fitment to<br>
a machine.<br>
The claims refer to a spindle. Herein the word<br>
"spindle" is intended to embrace any continuously<br>
rotatable part on a machine tool suitable for rotatably<br>
driving and holding a tool.<br>
The word "link" used in the description and claims is<br>
intended to embrace all electrical interfaces, serial<br>
or parallel, singular or plural path, contact or noncontact<br>
The signal is preferably transmitted at a frequency of<br>
between 1 and 100MHz. This range results in low<br>
losses. The power is preferably transmitted as a.c. at<br>
a frequency of more than 20KHz (approximately 100KHz<br>
being preferred). At this frequency, or greater,<br>
little electrolytic corrosion takes place between any<br>
contacts used. In order to reduce corrosion on<br>
contacts still further, the contacts can be made from<br>
Tungsten. Despite the lack of corrosion when using<br>
a.c. at a frequency of 20KHz or above a short pulse of<br>
power could be used to remove any corrosion during use,<br>
particularly in the signal paths S.<br><br><br><br><br>
