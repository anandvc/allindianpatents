Background An inkjet printing system, as one embodiment of a fluid ejection system, may include a printhead, an ink supply that provides liquid ink to the printhead, and an electronic controller that controls the printhead. The printhead, as one embodiment of a fluid ejection device, ejects ink drops through a plurality of orifices or nozzles. The ink is projected toward a print medium, such as a sheet of paper, to print an image onto the print medium. The nozzles are typically arranged in one or more arrays, such that properly sequenced ejection of ink from the nozzles causes characters or other images to be printed on the print medium as the printhead and the print medium are moved relative to each other.<br><br>
In a typical thermal Inkjet printing system, the printhead ejects ink drops through nozzles by rapidly heating small volumes of ink located in vaporization chambers. The ink is heated with small electric heaters, such as thin film resistors referred to herein as firing resistors. Heating the ink causes the ink to vaporize and be ejected through the nozzles.<br>
To eject one drop of ink, the electronic controller that controls the printhead activates an electrical current from a power supply external to the printhead. The electrical current is passed through a selected firing resistor to heat the ink in a corresponding selected vaporization chamber and eject the ink through a corresponding nozzle. Known drop generators include a firing resistor, a corresponding vaporization chamber, and a corresponding nozzle.<br>
As inkjet printheads have evolved, the number of drop generators in a printhead has increased to improve printing speed and/or quality. The increase in the number of drop generators per printhead has resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of input pads required on a printhead die to energize the increased number of firing resistors. In one type of printhead, each firing resistor is coupled to a corresponding input pad to provide power to energize the firing resistor. One input pad per firing resistor becomes impractical as the number of firing resistors increases.<br>
The number of drop generators per input pad is significantly increased in another type of printhead having primitives. A single power lead provides power to all firing resistors in one primitive. Each firing resistor is coupled in series with the power lead and the drain-source path of a corresponding field effect transistor (FET). The gate of each FET in a primitive is coupled to a separately energizable address lead that is shared by multiple primitives.<br>
Manufacturers continue reducing the number of input pads and increasing the number of drop generators on a printhead die. A printhead with fewer input pads typically costs less than a printhead with more input pads. Also, a printhead with more drop generators typically prints with higher quality and/or printing speed. To maintain costs and provide a particular printing swath height, printhead die size may not significantly change with an increased number of drop generators. As drop generator densities increase and the<br><br>
number of input pads decrease, printhead die layouts can become increasingly complex.<br>
For these and other reasons, there is a need for the present invention.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as "top," "bottom," "front," "back," "leading," "trailing," etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described.   Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of an inkjet printing system 20. Inkjet printing system 20 constitutes one embodiment of a fluid ejection system that includes a fluid ejection device, such as inkjet printhead assembly 22, and a fluid supply assembly, such as ink supply assembly 24. The inkjet printing system 20 also includes a mounting assembly 26, a media transport assembly 28, and an electronic controller 30. At least one power supply 32 provides power to the various electrical components of inkjet printing system 20.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes at least one printhead or printhead die 40 that ejects drops of ink through a plurality of orifices or nozzles 34 toward a print medium 36 so as to print onto print medium 36. Printhead 40 is one embodiment of a fluid ejection device. Print medium 36 may be any type of suitable sheet material, such as paper, card stock, transparencies, Mylar, fabric, and the like. Typically, nozzles 34 are arranged in one or more columns or arrays such that properly sequenced ejection of ink<br><br>
from nozzles 34 causes characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images to be printed upon print medium 36 as inkjet printhead assembly 22 and print medium 36 are moved relative to each other. While the following description refers to the ejection of ink from printhead assembly 22, it is understood that other liquids, fluids or flowable materials, including clear fluid, may be ejected from printhead assembly 22.<br>
Ink supply assembly 24 as one embodiment of a fluid supply assembly provides ink to printhead assembly 22 and includes a reservoir 38 for storing ink. As such, ink flows from reservoir 38 to inkjet printhead assembly 22. Ink supply assembly 24 and inkjet printhead assembly 22 can form either a one-way ink delivery system or a recirculating ink delivery system. In a one-way ink delivery system, substantially all of the ink provided to inkjet printhead assembly 22 is consumed during printing. In a recirculating ink delivery system, only a portion of the ink provided to printhead assembly 22 is consumed during printing. As such, ink not consumed during printing is returned to ink supply assembly 24.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 and ink supply assembly 24 are housed together in an inkjet cartridge or pen. The inkjet cartridge or pen is one embodiment of a fluid ejection device. In another embodiment, ink supply assembly 24 is separate from inkjet printhead assembly 22 and provides ink to inkjet printhead assembly 22 through an interface connection, such as a supply tube (not shown). In either embodiment, reservoir 38 of ink supply assembly 24 may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled. In one embodiment, where inkjet printhead assembly 22 and ink supply assembly 24 are housed together in an inkjet cartridge, reservoir 38 includes a local reservoir located within the cartridge and may also include a larger reservoir located separately from the cartridge. As such, the separate, larger reservoir serves to refill the local reservoir. Accordingly, the separate, larger reservoir and/or the local reservoir may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled.<br>
Mounting assembly 26 positions inkjet printhead assembly 22 relative to media transport assembly 28 and media transport assembly 28 positions print medium 36 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 22. Thus, a print zone 37 is<br><br>
defined adjacent to nozzles 34 in an area between inkjet printhead assembly 22 and print medium 36.  In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting assembly 26 includes a carriage (not shown) for moving inkjet printhead assembly 22 relative to media transport assembly 28 to scan print medium 36. In another embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a non-scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting assembly 26 fixes inkjet printhead assembly 22 at a prescribed position relative to media transport assembly 28. Thus, media transport assembly 28 positions print medium 36 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 22.<br>
Electronic controller or printer controller 30 typically includes a processor, firmware, and other electronics, or any combination thereof, for communicating with and controlling inkjet printhead assembly 22, mounting assembly 26, and media transport assembly 28. Electronic controller 30 receives data 39 from a host system, such as a computer, and usually includes memory for temporarily storing data 39. Typically, data 39 is sent to inkjet printing system 20 along an electronic, infrared, optical, or other information transfer path. Data 39 represents, for example, a document and/or file to be printed. As such, data 39 forms a print job for inkjet printing system 20 and includes one or more print job commands and/or command parameters.<br>
In one embodiment, electronic controller 30 controls inkjet printhead assembly 22 for ejection of ink drops from nozzles 34. As such, electronic controller 30 defines a pattern of ejected ink drops that form characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images on print medium 36. The pattern of ejected ink drops is determined by the print job commands and/or command parameters.<br>
In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes one printhead 40. In another embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 is a wide-array or multi-head printhead assembly. In one wide-array embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 22 includes a carrier, which carries printhead dies 40, provides electrical communication between printhead dies 40 and electronic controller 30, and provides fluidic communication between printhead dies 40 and ink supply assembly 24.<br><br>
Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating a portion of one embodiment of a printhead die 40. The printhead die 40 includes an array of printing or fluid ejecting elements 42. Printing elements 42 are formed on a substrate 44, which has an ink feed slot 46 formed therein. As such, ink feed slot 46 provides a supply of liquid ink to printing elements 42. Ink feed slot 46 is one embodiment of a fluid feed source. Other embodiments of fluid feed sources include but are not limited to corresponding individual ink feed holes feeding corresponding vaporization chambers and multiple shorter ink feed trenches that each feed corresponding groups of fluid ejecting elements. A thin-film structure 48 has an ink feed channel 54 formed therein which communicates with ink feed slot 46 formed in substrate 44. An orifice layer 50 has a front face 50a and a nozzle opening 34 formed in front face 50a. Orifice layer 50 also has a nozzle chamber or vaporization chamber 56 formed therein which communicates with nozzle opening 34 and ink feed channel 54 of thin-film structure 48. A firing resistor 52 is positioned within vaporization chamber 56 and leads 58 electrically couple firing resistor 52 to circuitry controlling the application of electrical current through selected firing resistors. A drop generator 60 as referred to herein includes firing resistor 52, nozzle chamber or vaporization chamber 56 and nozzle opening 34.<br>
During printing, ink flows from ink feed slot 46 to vaporization chamber 56 via ink feed channel 54. Nozzle opening 34 is operatively associated with firing resistor 52 such that droplets of ink within vaporization chamber 56 are ejected through nozzle opening 34 (e.g., substantially normal to the plane of firing resistor 52) and toward print medium 36 upon energizing of firing resistor 52.<br>
Example embodiments of printhead dies 40 include a thermal printhead, a piezoelectric printhead, an electrostatic printhead, or any other type of fluid ejection device known in the art that can be integrated into a multi-layer structure. Substrate 44 is formed, for example, of silicon, glass, ceramic, or a stable polymer and thin-film structure 48 is formed to include one or more passivation or insulation layers of silicon dioxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, tantalum, polysilicon glass, or other suitable material. Thin-film structure 48, also, includes at least one conductive layer, which defines firing resistor 52 and<br><br>
leads 58. In one embodiment, the conductive layer comprises, for example, aluminum, gold, tantalum, tantalum-aluminum, or other metal or metal alloy. In one embodiment, firing cell circuitry, such as described in detail below, is implemented in substrate and thin-film layers, such as substrate 44 and thin-film structure 48.<br>
In one embodiment, orifice layer 50 comprises a photoimageable epoxy resin, for example, an epoxy referred to as SU8, marketed by Micro-Chem, Newton, MA. Exemplary techniques for fabricating orifice layer 50 with SU8 or other polymers are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,162,589, which is herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, orifice layer 50 is formed of two separate layers referred to as a barrier layer (e.g., a dry film photo resist barrier layer) and a metal orifice layer (e.g., a nickel, copper, iron/nickel alloys, palladium, gold, or rhodium layer) formed over the barrier layer. Other suitable materials, however, can be employed to form orifice layer 50.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot 46 in one embodiment of printhead die 40. Ink feed slot 46 includes opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. Drop generators 60 are disposed along each of the opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. A total of n drop generators 60 are located along ink feed slot 46, with m drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot side 46a, and n - m drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot side 46b. In one embodiment, n equals 200 drop generators 60 located along ink feed slot 46 and m equals 100 drop generators 60 located along each of the opposing ink feed slot sides 46a and 46b. In other embodiments, any suitable number of drop generators 60 can be disposed along ink feed slot 46.<br>
Ink feed slot 46 provides ink to each of the n drop generators 60 disposed along ink feed slot 46. Each of the n drop generators 60 includes a firing resistor 52, a vaporization chamber 56 and a nozzle 34. Each of the n vaporization chambers 56 is fluidically coupled to ink feed slot 46 through at least one ink feed channel 54. The firing resistors 52 of drop generators 60 are energized in a controlled sequence to eject fluid from vaporization chambers 56 and through nozzles 34 to print an image on print medium 36.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a firing cell 70 employed in one embodiment of printhead die 40. Firing cell 70 includes a firing resistor 52, a resistor drive switch 72, and a memory circuit 74. Firing resistor 52 is part of a drop generator 60. Drive switch 72 and memory circuit 74 are part of the circuitry that controls the application of electrical current through firing resistor 52. Firing cell 70 is formed in thin-film structure 48 and on substrate 44.<br>
In one embodiment, firing resistor 52 is a thin-film resistor and drive switch 72 is a field effect transistor (FET). Firing resistor 52 is electrically coupled to a fire line 76 and the drain-source path of drive switch 72. The drain-source path of drive switch 72 is also electrically coupled to a reference line 78 that is coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground. The gate of drive switch 72 is electrically coupled to memory circuit 74 that controls the state of drive switch 72.<br>
Memory circuit 74 is electrically coupled to a data line 80 and enable lines 82. Data line 80 receives a data signal that represents part of an image and enable lines 82 receive enable signals to control operation of memory circuit 74. Memory circuit 74 stores one bit of data as it is enabled by the enable signals. The logic level of the stored data bit sets the state (e.g., on or off, conducting or non-conducting) of drive switch 72. The enable signals can include one or more select signals and one or more address signals.<br>
Fire line 76 receives an energy signal comprising energy pulses and provides an energy pulse to firing resistor 52. In one embodiment, the energy pulses are provided by electronic controller 30 to have timed starting times and timed duration to provide a proper amount of energy to heat and vaporize fluid in the vaporization chamber 56 of a drop generator 60. If drive switch 72 is on (conducting), the energy pulse heats firing resistor 52 to heat and eject fluid from drop generator 60. If drive switch 72 is off (non-conducting), the energy pulse does not heat firing resistor 52 and the fluid remains in drop generator 60.<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of an inkjet printhead firing cell array, indicated at 100. Firing cell array 100 includes a plurality of firing cells 70 arranged into n fire groups 102a-102n. In one embodiment, firing cells 70 are arranged into six fire groups 102a-102n. In<br><br>
other embodiments, firing cells 70 can be arranged into any suitable number of fire groups 102a-102n, such as four or more fire groups 102a-102n.<br>
The firing cells 70 in array 100 are schematically arranged into L rows and m columns. The L rows of firing cells 70 are electrically coupled to enable lines 104 that receive enable signals. Each row of firing cells 70, referred to herein as a row subgroup or subgroup of firing cells 70, is electrically coupled to one set of subgroup enable lines 106a-106L The subgroup enable lines 106a-106L receive subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL that enable the corresponding subgroup of firing cells 70.<br>
The m columns are electrically coupled to m data lines 108a-108m that receive data signals D1, D2 ... Dm, respectively. Each of the m columns includes firing cells 70 in each of the n fire groups 102a-102n and each column of firing cells 70, referred to herein as a data line group or data group, is electrically coupled to one of the data lines 108a-108m. In other words, each of the data lines 108a-108m is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in one column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n. For example, data line 108a is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the far left column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n. Data line 108b is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the adjacent column and so on, over to and including data line 108m that is electrically coupled to each of the firing cells 70 in the far right column, including firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n.<br>
In one embodiment, array 100 is arranged into six fire groups 102a-102n and each of the six fire groups 102a-102n includes 13 subgroups and eight data line groups. In other embodiments, array 100 can be arranged into any suitable number of fire groups 102a-102n and into any suitable number of subgroups and data line groups. In any embodiment, fire groups 102a-102n are not limited to having the same number of subgroups and data line groups. Instead, each of the fire groups 102a-102n can have a different number of subgroups and/or data line groups as compared to any other fire group 102a-102n. In addition, each subgroup can have a different number of firing cells 70 as compared to<br><br>
any other subgroup, and each data line group can have a different number of firing cells 70 as compared to any other data line group.<br>
The firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n are electrically coupled to one of the fire lines 110a-110n. In fire group 102a, each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110a that receives fire signal or energy signal FIRE1. In fire group 102b, each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110b that receives fire signal or energy signal FIRE2 and so on, up to and including fire group 102n wherein each of the firing cells 70 is electrically coupled to fire line 110n that receives fire signal or energy signal FIREn. In addition, each of the firing cells 70 in each of the fire groups 102a-102n is electrically coupled to a common reference line 112 that is tied to ground.<br>
In operation, subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL are provided on subgroup enable lines 106a-106L to enable one subgroup of firing cells 70. The enabled firing cells 70 store data signals D1, D2 ... Dm provided on data lines 108a-108m. The data signals D1, D2 ... Dm are stored in memory circuits 74 of enabled firing cells 70. Each of the stored data signals D1, D2 ... Dm sets the state of drive switch 72 in one of the enabled firing cells 70. The drive switch 72 is set to conduct or not conduct based on the stored data signal value.<br>
After the states of the selected drive switches 72 are set, an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided on the fire line 110a-110n corresponding to the fire group 102a-102n that includes the selected subgroup of firing cells 70. The energy signal FIRE1 -FIREn includes an energy pulse. The energy pulse is provided on the selected fire line 110a-110n to energize firing resistors 52 in firing cells 70 that have conducting drive switches 72. The energized firing resistors 52 heat and eject ink onto print medium 36 to print an image represented by data signals D1, D2 ... Dm. The process of enabling a subgroup of firing cells 70, storing data signals D1, D2 ... Dm in the enabled subgroup and providing an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn to energize firing resistors 52 in the enabled subgroup continues until printing stops.<br>
In one embodiment, as an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided to a selected fire group 102a-102n, subgroup enable signals SG1, SG2, ... SGL<br><br>
change to select and enable another subgroup in a different fire group 102a-102n. The newly enabled subgroup stores data signals D1, D2 ... Dm provided on data lines 108a-108m and an energy signal FIRE1-FIREn is provided on one of the fire lines 110a-110n to energize firing resistors 52 in the newly enabled firing cells 70.

Fire line 208c receives energy signal FIRE3 and provides an energy pulse to second resistive segment 306a through fire line conductive lead 314a.<br><br>
If drive switch 72a is conducting, the energy pulse provides a current through firing resistor 52a, drive switch conductive lead 312a and drive switch 72a to reference conductor 250. With reference conductor 250 electrically coupled to a reference voltage, such as ground, the current flows through reference conductor 250 to ground.<br>

The fire lines 208a-208f receive energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2, ...FIRE6 and supply the energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2 ...FIRE6 to firing cells 70 in fire groups 202a-202f.

Each fire line 208a-208f supplies energy to firing resistors 52 that are coupled to conducting drive switches 72. Energy is supplied to firing resistors 52 through the energy signals FIRE1, FIRE2, ...FIRE6. The energy heats the firing resistors 52 to heat and eject ink from drop generators 60. Variations in the amount of energy supplied to firing resistors 52 can result in ink drops that are not uniform in size and shape, resulting in a distorted printed image. To uniformly eject ink, each fire line 208a-208f is configured to maintain a suitable energy variation between firing resistors 52.<br>
Energy variation is the maximum percent difference in power dissipated through any two firing resistors 52 in one of the fire groups 202a-202f. The highest power is generally provided to the firing resistor 52 nearest the bond pad receiving the energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2, ...FIRE6 as only a single firing resistor 52 is energized. The lowest power is generally provided to the firing resistor 52 that is the furthest from the bond pad receiving the energy signal FIRE1, FIRE2, ... FIRE6 as all firing resistors 52 in a row subgroup are energized. Layout contributions to energy variation include fire line length, fire line width, fire line conductor thickness and ground line, e.g. reference conductor 250, dimensions. In an exemplary embodiment, the ground line portions, e.g. each of reference conductor portions 250a, 250b, 250c, and 250d, are less than 800 urn wide, an in one embodiment about 96 urn wide. In this exemplary embodiment, fire lines may be between 50 and 500 urn wide. These dimensions are for one exemplary embodiment; other embodiments may employ other sizes and dimensions. Energy variations of 10-15% are preferred and energy variations up to 20% have been found to be suitable energy variations.<br>
The fire groups 202a-202f and fire lines 208a-208f are disposed in printhead die 200 to achieve a suitable energy variation between firing resistors 52. Instead of all firing cells 70 in one fire group 202a-202f being disposed along one side of one ink feed slot 204 or 206, resulting in a long fire line 208a-208f, the firing cells 70 in one fire group 202a-202f are disposed along opposing sides of one ink feed slot 204 or 206, or along both ink feed slots 204 and 206. This reduces the length of the corresponding fire line 208a-208f.<br><br>
