				<td>A METHOD FOR DISTRIBUTING REALTIME UPDATES<br>
TO ACTIVE APPLICATION COMPONENTS IN AN<br>
ACTIVE CLIENT POSITION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of client server applications and the distribution of application updates.  More particularly, the instant invention relates to a method and apparatus for distributing application updates while a host platform for the application is still active.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In typical computing environments, there is often a need to provide an automated method for distributing software from a server to one or more client applications.  Computing environments are typically composed of one or more servers which provide localized or specialized services to one or more clients.  These distributed environments result in information being spread across various heterogenous data stores.  One of the consequences of having information spread across heterogeneous data stores is that data can easily be duplicated.  However, spurious duplication often results in inconsistent updating.<br>
Various methods have been employed to provide an efficient solution for performing operations on data in a distributed computed environment. In particular, operations can include, locating, adding, deleting, and modifying the data.  One solution involves utilizing a directory service acting as a central repository for storing all data within an environment. In this solution, the directory service is the single point from which the data contained therein is manipulated.<br>
The use of a directory service for storing and accessing data in a distributed environment can be advantageous in several respects.  A directory service provides a single central resource for managing resources that may be localized as in a local area network (LAN), or distributed as in a wide area network (WAN).  Additionally, since there is only a single central repository, resources within the environment can be replicated to ensure peak performance and also for redundancy purposes.<br>
Since the directory service defines a single format for storing data, other applications having disparate storage formats can, through a single interface, communicate with the directory service.  Since the single open<br>
format allows interoperability among various vendors, applications from other vendors can easily be shared with the directory service.  Moreover, the single format is flexible enough that it can easily be extended to permit future growth that might occur as a result of technical advances or simply due to a need to scale the size of the operating environment.<br>
Given these advantages, several directory service technologies have been created to access data stores.  Among these methodologies is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  LDAP defines a model for storing entries in a directory service and a method for accessing these entries in a directory service.  LDAP provides access to the directory service through the use of a TCP/IP connection.  The data stored in a directory service can include, but is not limited to, user information, application updates and configuration information.<br>
An entry is the basic data unit entity in the LDAP technology.  An entry is an object that contains persistent information about a specific resource.  Each entry has a unique identifier referred to as a distinguished name (DN), and belongs to a directory information tree (DIT). Each entry of the LDAP is composed of a collection of attributes with each attribute defining some specific characteristic of the entry.  Each attribute is associated with a specific value type.<br>
Many attempts have been made to automate the distribution of software in the client-server environment.  However, present solutions lack the capability to perform realtime application updates and software distribution to active applications without having to reboot the supporting platform.  Additionally, present automated software distribution systems do not support realtime updates of configuration data without first shutting down all active applications and subsequently rebooting the platform. Thus, there exists a need for efficiently distributing application updates and configuration to a host platform while the host platform is still actively running other applications.<br>
configuration client over the second communications connection.  Notably, each update can correspond to at least one particular application component.       Subsequently, the platform can be notified that updates have become available.  Responsive to receiving such a notification, the execution of the particular active application components can be terminated.  Following termination, each update can be delivered over the first communications connection to the platform, and each update can be applied to the particular application components.  Finally, each updated application component can be re-executed.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the termination step can include identifying the particular corresponding application component to be updated based on the notification; terminating instances of each identified application component; and,  removing interdependencies between the terminated application component instances and other application components.  Additionally, the re-executing step can include instantiating each updated application component; and initializing each updated application component instance.  Moreover, the initializing step can include communicating configuration information to the configuration client; and reinitializing state information internal to each updated application component based on the configuration information.  Finally, the method can further include requesting from the configuration client update notifications, the update notifications notifying the platform of application component updates as the updates become available in the configuration server.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the method can further include transmitting update notifications over the second communications connection to the configuration client.  In particular, the update notifications can notify the configuration client of application component updates as the updates become available in the configuration server. Additionally, the step of transmitting update notifications over the second connection can include packetizing the update notifications according to the universal datagram protocol (UDP); and transmitting the UDP packets to the configuration client.  Finally, in yet another aspect of the present invention, the configuration server can be an LDAP server.  Accordingly, the method can include storing the application component updates in an LDAP-based database in the LDAP server.<br>
In yet another aspect of the method of the invention, a method for distributing realtime updates to active application components executing in an active client position can include first receiving updates to the active application components from a communicatively linked configuration client, wherein each update corresponds to at least one particular application<br>
component.  Second, execution of each particular active application component having a received corresponding update can be terminated.  Third, the received updates can be applied to the corresponding application components.  Finally, the updated application components can be re-executed.<br>
The terminating step can include terminating instances of each particular active application component having a received corresponding update; and removing interdependencies between the terminated application component instances and other application components.  The re-executing step can include instantiating each updated application component; and initializing each updated application component instance.  Finally, the method also can include subscribing to update notifications from the configuration client, wherein the update notifications notify the active client position of application component updates as the updates become available.<br>
A system for updating active client positions can include a platform for managing active application components; a configuration server for storing updates; and, a configuration client for receiving updates from the configuration server and communicating the received updates to the platform. The platform can receive the updates from the configuration client.  Subsequently, the platform can terminate selected ones of the active application components.  Then, the platform can apply the received updates to the terminated application components.  Finally, the platform can reload the updated application components.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the configuration server can<br>
be an LDAP server.  In another aspect of the present invention, the active<br>
application components can be instances of Java classes.  In yet another<br>
aspect of the present invention, the configuration client can include a<br>

application components can be configured to receive update notifications<br>
from the configuration client through the listener interface.  Similarly,<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
There are presently shown in the drawings embodiments which are presently preferred, it being understood, however, that the invention is not so limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities shown, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a high-level schematic illustrating a system for performing realtime configuration updates and software distribution to active client positions.<br>
Figure 2 is a network architecture diagram for use in the system of Figure 1; and<br>
Figures 3A and 3B, taken together, are a UML sequence diagram illustrating a process for performing realtime configuration updates and software distribution to active client positions in the system illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a system for performing realtime configuration updates and software distribution to active client positions in a client-server environment.  In particular, the system of the present invention can distribute software and configuration data to client positions without having to reboot each client position.  Figure 1 illustrates a network architecture configured for use with the system of the invention.  As shown in Figure 1, the system for performing realtime configuration updates and software distribution to active client positions can include a configuration server 105, a computer communications network 115, and a plurality of client positions 110A, 110B, 110C connected to the configuration server 105 through the computer communications network 115.<br>
As each client position 110A, 110B, 110C undergoes bootstrap, a communications link can be established between the configuration server 105 and the client positions 110A, 110B, 110C.  Subsequently, each booted client position 110A, 110B, 110C can query the configuration server 105 to identify the application components which are to be installed in the client position 110A, 110B, 110C.  Upon identifying the application components, each client position 110A, 110B, 110C can install the identified application components.<br>
Significantly, upon initialization each application component can request that the application component be notified of any future updates.<br>
When updates become available at the configuration server 105, messages can be broadcast to the client positions 110A, HOB, HOC notifying the positions of the update.  In response, a communications link again can be established between affected client positions 110A, HOB, HOC. Subsequently, the updates, including configuration data and updated modules, can be retrieved through the communications link.  Following retrieval, the application components to which the updates are to be applied can be terminated, updated and re-loaded.  Notably, once re-loaded, the application components will have incorporated the updates.  Hence, the system of the present invention can perform realtime application updates of application components in active client positions.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the interaction between a configuration server 201 and a single client position 207 through a network 206.  The network 206 can be a LAN, WAN a data bus, or other suitable medium for communicatively linking distributed processes.  As shown in the figure, the single client position 207 can include a configuration client 202, at least one application component 205, an application platform 203 for managing the application components 205, and an application loader 204 for loading and unloading the application components 205.  Still, the invention is not limited in this regard and the configuration client 202 can be included as an application component external to the client position 207 in a distributed environment.<br>
Notably, the invention is limited neither in the number of application components 205 managed by the platform 203, nor in the number of platforms 203 for managing the application components 205.  Moreover, the loader 204 can be included as part of the platform 204 or can exist independently of the platform 203.  Finally, the configuration client 202 can be included as an application component managed by the platform 203 along with the application components 205.  The configuration server 201 can store both configuration data 214 and software modules 216 for distribution to the client positions.  Specifically, the configuration server 201 can store the data 214 and modules 216 in an LDAP file server 210.  However, the invention is not limited in this regard.  Rather, the data 214 and modules 216 can be stored and accessed through any suitable means, for example an XML file server.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the configuration client 202 can be managed separately from the platform 203.  Moreover, in one aspect of the invention, the configuration client 202 can be implemented as a Java Bean. In consequence, the configuration client 202 Java Bean implementation can be reused by other applications.  Notably, the platform 203 can be a Java-based platform for managing application components 205.  As such, the<br>
platform 203 can behave as an object request broker (ORB) for the various application components 205 installed on the platform 203.<br>
In operation, when the client position 207 undergoes bootstrap, the platform 203 can start the configuration client 202.  Once started, the configuration client 202 can read a bootstrap properties file containing only the uniform resource locator (URL) of the configuration server 201 and a client position identifier.  Subsequently, the configuration client 202 can establish a communications connection to the configuration server 201. In particular, the communications connection can be an LDAP connection to an LDAP server using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI/LDAP). Still, the invention is not limited in regard to the particular communications connection.  Rather, any suitable communications connection can suffice.  For example, the communications connection can be a point-to-point TCP/IP connection to a CGI interface to a flat-file database using HTTP.<br>
Once a communications connection has been established, the configuration client 202 can perform an initial inquiry of the configuration server 201 using the position identifier as the search argument.  A response to the initial inquiry can include a list of application components 205 to be installed in the client position 207. Subsequently, the configuration client 202 can inspect the list and can perform secondary inquiries for each of application components 205 in the list.  As before, secondary responses to the secondary inquiries can include executable modules for the application components 205 as well as configuration data that can include server addresses necessary for the execution of the application components 205.<br>
The secondary responses can be received in the platform 203.  Once received, the application components 205 can be executed.  More particularly, the platform 203 can retrieve a list of each application component 205 to be installed in the client position 207.  Subsequently, each application component 205 can be installed by performing appropriate instantiations and calling required initialization methods defined in a corresponding application component interface.<br>
During initialization, each application component 205 can request corresponding configuration data from the configuration client 202. Examples of configuration data can include option settings, screen definitions, and server addresses. When received, the requesting application component 205 can perform an appropriate initialization.  Each application component 205 also can request that the configuration client 202 notify the application component 205 of future updates for utilization<br>
by the application component 205.  Notably, in one aspect of the invention the application component notification facility can include an implementation of an observer design pattern.  Notwithstanding, the invention is not limited in this regard.  Rather, other implementations of the application component notification facility can suffice, including storing a list of application components in a database and notifying selected application components each time an update is received which is directed to an application component in the list.<br>
When updates become available in the configuration server 201, an update message can be transmitted to client positions 207 containing application components 205 to which the update is directed.  Still, the invention is not limited in this regard.  Rather, the messages can be broadcast messages or UDP narrow-cast messages directed to client positions 207 regardless of the application components 205 contained therein.  In any case, once the configuration client 202 receives an update message, the configuration client 202 can establish a new communications connection to the configuration server 201.  As before, the communications connection can be an LDAP connection where the configuration server 201 is an LDAP server. Subsequently, updates in the form of updated configuration data and software modules can be transmitted to the configuration client 202 through the communications connection.<br>
Once the updated configuration data and software modules have been retrieved, the configuration client 202 can notify the platform 203 that updates have been received.  For example, in a Java or C++ implementation, the configuration client 202 can generate an update received event and transmit the same to the platform 203.  In response, if updated software modules have been received, the platform 203 can identify application components to which the updates are directed.  Where an update is updated configuration data which does not require the termination of the targeted application component 205, the platform 203 can simply deliver the update to the targeted application component 205.  Specifically, the configuration client 202 can notify the targeted application component 205 that updated configuration data has been received.  In response, the targeted application components 205 can retrieve the updated configuration data from the configuration client 202 and can reinitialize associated internal states appropriately.<br>
In contrast, where an update is either an updated software module or updated configuration data which requires the termination and re-instantiation of the application component 205, the platform 203 can terminate the targeted application component 205 prior to applying the update to the targeted application component 205.  In one aspect of the<br>
invention, the platform 203 can terminate the execution of the targeted application component 205 by accessing a terminate method associated with the targeted application component 205 and exposed by an interface to the targeted application component 205.  Significantly, when applying an update to a targeted application component 205, a two-phased startup and shutdown approach can be implemented.<br>
In consequence of this approach, application components 205 can remove any interdependencies without necessarily affecting program execution of other application components 205.  Once the application component 205 has been terminated, the platform can apply the update according to configuration data associated with the update.  Subsequently, the platform 203 can re-instantiate the targeted application component 205. Additionally, the platform 203 then can call the initialization method of the targeted application component 205 so that the targeted application component 205 can properly reload.<br>
Turning now to Figures 3A and 3B, a communications sequence is illustrated in which the system of Figures 1 and 2 can be configured to distributed realtime updates to active client positions.  As in Figures 1 and 2, the system can include a configuration server 301, a configuration client 302, a platform 303, a loader 304, and application components 305A-305C.  Additionally, the system can include a bootstrap probe 306 for assisting the configuration client 302 during bootstrap.<br>
Turning now to Figure 3A, when the platform 303 undergoes bootstrap, the platform 303 can perform an instantiation 310 of the loader 304 and the configuration client 302.  The platform 303 then can perform a series of runtime communication routines with the configuration client 302 such as getlnstance() 312 to acquire a particular instance of the configuration client 302, addConfigListener(string) 314 to instruct the configuration client 302 to add the platform as a listener/observer and getConfig(string) 316 to retrieve configuration data.  Once this initial phase of bootstrap has completed, the configuration client 302 can read 318 a bootstrap properties file and can extract therefrom an address for the configuration server 301.  In one aspect of the invention, the bootstrap properties file can contain a URL of the configuration server 301 and a position identifier.<br>
Once the bootstrap operation has completed, the configuration client 302 can establish a communications connection to the configuration server 301.  In particular, where the configuration server 301 is an LDAP server, the configuration client 302 can establish an LDAP connection to the configuration server 301 using JNDI/LDAP.  Subsequently, a getContext()<br>
method 320 can be used by the configuration client 302 to acquire the context of the configuration server 301.  An initial inquiry then can be made to the configuration server 301 by the configuration client 302 to retrieve a list of client application component types.  The initial inquiry 322 can use the position identifier of the configuration client 302 as a search argument.<br>
In response to the initial inquiry 322, the configuration server 301 can return a response containing a list of client application component types to be installed in the platform 303.  Subsequently, the configuration client 302 can cycle through the list of client application component types and can issue corresponding secondary inquiries 328 and 332 for each of the application component types defined, in order to retrieve related client configuration data.  The responses to the secondary inquiries 328, 332 can contain executable modules for the application components 305A, 305B, 305C. To complete this initial stage, an enumeration 338 of the responses from the configuration client 302 can be returned to the platform 303.<br>
Turning now to Figure 3B, the platform 303, using the configuration data, can load and initialize an appropriate platform interface to the loader 304 using the load(Platformlnterface) method 340.  Once initialized, the loader 304 can perform a series of communication routines with the configuration client 302.  Specifically, the loader 304 can access a getlnstance() method 342 in order to acquire the particular instance of the configuration client 302.  Additionally, the loader 304 can access an addConfigListener(string) 344 in order to instruct the configuration client 302 to add the loader 304 as a listener/observer.  Finally, the loader 304 can access a getConfigtstring) method 346 to retrieve the configuration data containing the names of classes to instantiate.<br>
For each of the class names of application components 305A, 305B, 305C listed in the configuration data provided by the configuration server 301 in the inquiries, 324, 328, and 332, the following sequence of events can occur.  First, the loader 304 can instantiate 348 the application component 305A, 305B, 305C and can provide to the application component 305A, 305B, 305C a reference to the platform 303 through the setup(reference to Platform) method 350.  Subsequently, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can undergo initialization.<br>
Specifically, in accordance with the two-phased startup and shutdown approach described above, a first phase 352 of the initialization process can follow the completion of the setup(reference to Platform) method 350 in which an existing instance of the application component 305A, 305B, 305C is shutdown and the application component 305A, 305B, 305C is updated.<br>
Subsequently, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can be re-instantiated.<br>
Following the first phase of the initialization 352, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can establish a communications link with the configuration client 302.  In particular, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can access a getlnstance() method 354 in order to acquire the particular instance of the configuration client 302.  Additionally, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can access an<br>
addConfigListener(string) 356 in order to instruct the configuration client 302 to add the application component 305A, 305B, 305C as a<br>
listener/observer.  Finally, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can access a getConfig(string) method 358 to retrieve the configuration data for the particular instance of the application component 305A, 305B, 305C.<br>
Subsequently, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can register with the platform 303 using a register() function 360.  Following registration, the loader 304 can begin the execution of the application component 305A, 305B, 305C using the start method 362.  Additionally, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can subscribe to the platform 303 for future updates using a subscribed method 364.  In particular, the subscribed method 364 can ensure that the application component 305A, 305B, 305C will be notified of future component and/or configuration updates.  Following the subscription process, the application component 305A, 305B, 305C can begin a second and final initialization phase 366 of the two-phased startup and shutdown process.  When initialization has completed, the loader 3 04 can activate the updated application component 305A, 305B, 305C using the activated function 368.<br>
Notably, the present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.  The method of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system, or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems.  Any kind of computer system or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein is suited.
