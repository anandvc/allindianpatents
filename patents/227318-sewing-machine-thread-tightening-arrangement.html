				<td>Scwing-Machine Thread-Tightening Arrangement<br>
The invention relates to a thread-tightening arrangement for a sewing ma-<br>
chine.<br>
In some sewing jobs, it can happen that producing a seam on one and the<br>
same work piece or work pieces will alternately need higher or lower<br>
thread tightening. This occurs for instance when bulges are sewn, resulting<br>
from cross seams or stripes of material that are additionally inserted in a<br>
work piece. In sewing jobs of this kind, switching from one pre-set, repro-<br>
ducible value of thread tightening to another must be possible promptly and<br>
without any loss of time.<br>
DE 197 53 107 C2 describes a sewing-machine thread-tightening arrange-<br>
ment in which several thread tighteners can be triggered by pneumatic<br>
drives for varying thread tightening to occur in a respective needle thread.<br>
Drawbacks reside in the necessity of compressed-air supply for operation<br>
of the thread-tightening arrangement, which is not available in every sew-<br>
ing workshop. Moreover, this thread-tightening arrangement is construc-<br>
tionally complicated.<br>
DE 25 16 639 C3 teaches a thread tightener that is provided with a sole-<br>
noid, by means of which, against the force of a pre-loaded compression<br>
spring, to lift from one another the strain washers that hold the needle<br>
thread between them. In this way, the thread tightener can be put into an<br>
operating state of needle-thread tightening and into an operating state of<br>
needle-thread release. This is no direct solution of the problems described<br>
at the outset.<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to embody a thread-tightening arrangement<br>
in which, by simple means, to produce at least two varying, preset values<br>
of thread-tightening in a needle thread.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the features of claim<br>
1. Based on constructionally simple and uncomplicated means, the meas-<br>
ures according to the invention offer the possibility of using two thread<br>
tighteners and, optionally, turning off one thread tightener or both of them.<br>
Of course, three thread tighteners are conceivable, which are connected in<br>
series according to the invention.<br>
Claim 2 reflects an especially simple solution of a drive, current supply<br>
existing in every sewing machine. Claim 3 reflects an especially simple<br>
possibility of triggering.<br>
Claim 4 reflects an especially simple design of how to dispose the thread<br>
tighteners on the thread tightening arrangement. The improvement accord-<br>
ing to claim 5 precludes any inadvertent release of both thread tighteners<br>
when only the first thread tightener is to be released. To this end, provision<br>
is made for the further development according to claim 6.<br>
The development according to claim 7 enables the first thread tightener or<br>
both thread tighteners to be released manually if necessary.<br>
The thread tighteners may be embodied substantially conventionally ac-<br>
cording to claim 8.<br>
Details of the invention will become apparent from the ensuing description<br>
of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, in which<br><br>
Fig. 1 is an illustration of a sewing machine comprising a thread-<br>
tightening arrangement;<br>
Fig. 2 is a view of the thread-thightening arrangement on an enlarged<br>
scale;<br>
Fig. 3 is a vertical, cross-sectional view of the thread-tightening arrange-<br>
ment on the line III-III of Fig. 1 on an enlarged scale as opposed to<br>
Fig. 2; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic view of the thread-tightening arrangement, com-<br>
prising a control system for triggering the linear drive.<br>
The sewing machine seen in the drawing conventionally includes a base<br>
plate 1 in the form of a casing, a top arm 2 and a standard 3 uniting them. It<br>
is C-shaped. An arm shaft 4 is lodged in the arm 2, via a crank mechanism<br>
actuating a needle bar 5 with a needle 6. Actuation of the arm shaft 4 takes<br>
place by way of a driving motor (not shown). A hook that is allocated to<br>
the needle 6 is disposed in the base plate 1, actuation of the hook deriving<br>
from the arm shaft 4.<br>
Mounted on the side wall 8 that is allocated to the operator's side 7 of the<br>
sewing machine is a thread-tightening arrangement 9 which a needle thread<br>
10	is fed to, coming from a supply of needle thread (not shown). The nee-<br>
dle thread 10 is led through the arrangement 9 to a customary thread lever<br>
11	and from there to the needle 6.<br><br>
The thread-tightening arrangement 9 comprises a supporting plate 12<br>
which props against the side wall 8 at a distance therefrom and is fixed<br>
thereto by screws 14. A pre-tightener 16, a second thread tightener 17, a<br>
first thread tightener 18 and a deflector 19 are disposed on the supporting<br>
plate 12 in the way of the needle thread 10 corresponding to the direction<br>
of feed 15 thereof. The pre-tightener 16 of conventional design very<br>
slightly pre-tightens a needle thread 10 that passes there-through, this pre-<br>
tightening primarily ensuring defined supply of the needle thread 10 to the<br>
thread tighteners 17, 18. The real thread-tightening job takes place in the<br>
thread tighteners 17, 18, which is going to be explained in detail below.<br>
Deflecting the needle thread 10 from the thread-tightening arrangement 9<br>
towards the thread lever 11 takes place by way of a leg spring 20 which is<br>
mounted on the deflector 19 and, as a sort of a buffer, reliably compensates<br>
any kinematic errors that might involve the thread lever 11.<br>
The two thread tighteners 17, 18 are identical. Each of them has a support-<br>
ing bolt 21 which is mounted on the supporting plate 12 and stands out to-<br>
wards the operator's side 7. The free end turned towards the operator's side<br>
7 is provided with a regulating wheel 22 on a thread 23, the wheel 22 thus<br>
being adjustable in the longitudinal direction of the bolt 21. The regulating<br>
wheel 22 is provided with a plastic ring 24 which engages with the thread<br>
23, working as a self-locking mechanism against any inadvertent rotation<br>
of the regulating wheel 22.<br>
A pair of strain washers 25, 26 is displaceably mounted on the bolt 21, the<br>
needle thread 10 being guided there-between. A strain washer 25 props<br>
against the supporting plate 12. A pressure plate 27 is mounted on the bolt<br>
21 for displacement in the longitudinal direction of the bolt 21, bearing<br>
against the strain washer 26 that faces away from the supporting plate 12.<br><br>
The pressure plate 27 is guided non-rotatably, but longitudinally displace-<br>
ably in a slit 28 of the bolt 21. A compression spring 29 in the form of a<br>
conical spring is disposed between the regulating wheel 22 and the pressure<br>
plate 27, its pre-load being modified by rotation of the regulating wheel 22.<br>
This spring 29 presses the pressure plate 27 against the strain washer 26<br>
which is again forced against the strain washer 25, in this way acting on a<br>
needle thread 10, which runs between the strain washers 25, 26, by some<br>
frictional force and, consequently, braking force, the extent of which de-<br>
pends on the pre-load of the compression spring 29. A release pin 30 bears<br>
against the pressure plate 27, passing through the bolt 21 from the side that<br>
faces the wall 8 so that any insertion of the release pin 30 into the bolt 21 in<br>
the direction towards the pressure plate 27 will lift the pressure plate 27 off<br>
the strain washer 26, cancelling the pre-load of the compression spring 29.<br>
The needle thread 10 then runs approximately frictionlessly between the<br>
washers 25, 26.<br>
A release lever 31 is pivotably mounted on the supporting plate 12 on the<br>
side that faces away from the operator's side 7 i.e., between the wall 8 and<br>
the supporting plate 12. To this end, provision is made for two screws 32<br>
which are disposed in the vicinity of the bottom edges of the supporting<br>
plate 12 and the lever 31, each of them enveloped by a spacer sleeve 33;<br>
they constitute a pivoting bearing of the release lever 31. In the vicinity of<br>
the screws 32, between the lever 31 and the supporting plate 12, a rubber<br>
ring is provided, serving as a restoring spring 34, restoring the lever 31 into<br>
a position pivoted towards the wall 8 in accordance with the illustration of<br>
Fig. 3. When the release lever 31 is pivoted in a direction towards the sup-<br>
porting plate 12, it first bears against the release pin 30 of the first thread<br>
tightener 18 and, when further pivoted, it will bear against the release pin<br>
30 of the second thread tightener 17.<br><br>
The lever 31 is operated by way of a linear drive 35 which comprises a so-<br>
lenoid 36 that is mounted on the wall 8 inside the arm 2; its tappet 37<br>
passes through a hole 38 in the wall 8 and bears against the lever 31 at a<br>
clear distance from the pivoting bearing of the lever 31 formed by the<br>
screws 32. The top side of the lever 31, turned away from the bearing<br>
thereof, is provided with a handle 39, by means of which to operate the<br>
handle 31 manually. By means of a screw 41, a leaf spring 42 is mounted<br>
on a bearing 40 that is formed on the wall 8 inside the arm 2, projecting<br>
through a passageway 43 in the wall 8 towards the supporting plate 12. It<br>
has a crimped portion 44 backed up by a locating area 45 of the lever 31.<br>
The crimped portion 44 is arranged in such a way that the locating area 45<br>
of the lever 31 will bear against it before the release pin 30 of the second<br>
thread tightener 17 is pushed in. Consequently, the leaf spring 42 and its<br>
crimped portion 44 constitute a lever-31 switching resistance that must be<br>
overcome before the lever 31 touches the release pin 30 of the second<br>
thread tightener 17.<br>
As seen in Fig. 4, the solenoid 36 comprises a wound coil 47 with a core 48<br>
arranged therein in such a way that it is retracted into the wound coil 47<br>
upon actuation thereof by current. The core 48 comprises the tappet 37<br>
which is pushed out towards the lever 31 when the core 48 is retracted into<br>
the coil 47.<br>
Current supply is effected by way of a control system 49, triggering the<br>
coil 47 of the solenoid 36; by means of a pulse-width modulator 50 and a<br>
subsequent amplifier 51, the control system 49 produces a direct current<br>
that is formed by square-wave signals of varying time intervals. Actuation<br>
takes place via selectors 52, 53 of the control system 49, with the first se-<br><br>
lector 52 triggering the release force that acts on the tappet 37 to such an<br>
extent that the first thread tightener 18 is released, cancelling of the fric-<br>
tional force by which the first thread tightener 18 acts on the needle thread<br>
10. The selector 53 triggers the coil 47 for full current flux so that the lever<br>
31 first pushes in the release pin 30 of the first thread tightener 18, then<br>
overcoming the switching resistance 46 and afterwards pushing in the re-<br>
lease pin 30 of the second thread tightener 17, both thread tighteners 17, 18<br>
then being released. This near complete cancellation of thread tightening<br>
load is not needed during a sewing operation, but regularly at the end of a<br>
sewing job, when the work piece and the needle thread 10 must be re-<br>
moved from under the needle 6. As long as the solenoid 36 is not excited,<br>
combined tightening load acts on the needle thread 10, exercised by both<br>
thread tighteners 17, 18. With little current flowing through the solenoid<br>
36, this will cancel only the tightening load of the first thread tightener 18,<br>
while the tightening load of the second thread tightener 17 continues to<br>
work on the needle thread 10.<br>
The currents that are released by the two selectors 52, 53 are dimensioned<br>
such that, given identical design of both thread tighteners 17, 18 and in par-<br>
ticular identical dimensions of the compression springs 29, the load that<br>
acts on the two release pins 30 upon full current flux is twice the load exer-<br>
cised on the release pin 30 of the first thread tightener 18.<br><br>
