TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gas barrier packaging laminate having durability to stress crack formation and yet a bending stiffness and good integrity between the laminate layers, comprising outside layers of heat-sealable olefin polymer, a first gas barrier layer of SiOx, coated onto a first polymer carrier layer and a second gas barrier layer of SiOx, coated onto a second polymer carrier layer, and an intermediate polymer layer laminated between the first and the second gas barrier coated polymer carrier layers. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing the packaging laminate and to packaging containers produced from the packaging laminate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
On the market today, there is an increasing demand for packages for beverage and liquid food of the type that are single-use disposable plastic pouches, preferably at least partly, at some portion of the package, transparent to display the contents to the consumer when exposed on the shelf, e.g. in the food store. Most commonly such packages are provided with a straw for direct drinking or a pull-tab for opening and pouring of the contents. Such packages do not have the advantage of having the dimension and grip stability of the more common paperboard packaging laminate drink packages of the TetraBrik®-type. However, they have the image of a more positive environmental profile in many countries, with the argument that the amount of used packaging material as well as the volume of the emptied package is very small and because it may be recyclable with other similar flexible plastic items. Furthermore, the traditional Tetra Brik-type packages have an oxygen barrier layer of aluminium foil, which in some countries is less desirable and which also makes a transparent package impossible.<br>
In the high-speed, continuous packaging processes well known for the paperboard packages of the TetraBrik®-type, a web of the packaging laminate is continuously formed into a tube, filled with contents and sealed off to pillow-shaped packaging<br><br>
containers by a simultaneous heat sealing and cutting operation. The piflow-shaped packaging container is then normally foldformed into a parallellepipedic packaging container. The main advantage of this continuous tube- forming, filling and sealing packaging process concept is that the web may be sterilized continuously just before tube-forming, thus providing for the possibility of an aseptic packaging process, i. e. a process wherein the liquid content to be filled as well as the packaging material itself are reduced from bacteria and the filled packaging container is produced under clean circumstances such that the filled package may be stored for a long time even at ambient temperature, without the risk of growth of microorganisms in the filled product. An important factor for long- term storage is of course also the gas barrier properties of the filled and sealed packaging container, which in turn is highly dependent on the gas barrier properties of the packaging laminate itself but also on the qualities of the seals and of the opening arrangement of the final package. Another important advantage of the TetraBrik®-type packaging process is, as stated above, the possibility of continuous high-speed packaging, which has considerable impact on cost efficiency. The pouch-type drink packages available today on the market, are however, typically manufactured by other non-aseptic, more complex and expensive processes of less continuous character.<br>
In the prior art it is also known to apply gas barrier coatings of SiOx onto a substrate by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The advantages with a SiOx gas barrier layer compared to other gas barrier materials are firstly that it has a positive environmental profile, secondly, that it is not affected, i.e. the barrier properties remain intact, when in contact with surrounding moisture or liquid, it is transparent and since it is applied in very thin layers, also flexible and resistant to cracking when bent or folded.<br>
It is known from EP-A-385054 to laminate two gas barrier layers of a silicon compound, such as silicon dioxide, facing each other, by means of an intermediate adhesive layer. This document, however, is silent on the resistance to stress crack formation and the laminate layer integrity at mechanical stress and the stiffness<br><br>
properties of the laminate and does not describe an intermediate layer providing a shock absorbing but yet stiffening effect to the laminate. Moreover, the silicon dioxide (SiOA) layers described are very different from the PECVD-coated layers of SiOx intended according to this invention.<br>
There is thus a need for a thin, gas-tight, metalfoil-free packaging laminate having suitable properties for an aseptic, continuous high-speed packaging process similar to the Terra Brik Aseptic ® packaging process. Important factors in such a process are the stifmess, elasticity and integrity of the packaging laminate. If the laminate web is too flexible and easy to displace in the high-speed tube-forming operation, the process will not be able to run safely and continuously. On the other hand, if the packaging laminate is too thick in order to obtain the required stiffness and durability, it may be difficult to manage in the fold-forming operation, and if it is not elastic and having shock absorbing properties during transport and handling, it will be prone to cracking and lose its integrity due to mechanical stress. Moreover and naturally, the cost-efficiency of the material itself will be reduced with increasing thickness. The pouch-type drink packages available today on the market often have a laminated structure including a single gas barrier layer of, for example, an ethylene vinyl alcohol polymer (EVOH), and do not have the requirements on stiffness properties according to the present invention.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a packaging laminate that alleviates the above discussed disadvantages and problems.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a non-foil packaging laminate, having gas barrier properties suitable for aseptic packaging and long-term storage, as well as sufficient bending stiffness and integrity and resistance to stress crack formation at mechanical stress to be suitable for continuous, high speed packaging of liquid foods by means of a continuous tube-forming process and to provide packages durable to repetitive stress during transport and handling.<br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a packaging laminate film having such required stiffness and durability but being sufficiently thin for foidforming of the package at at least one end of the package.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to provide a packaging laminate film having the above properties but also being transparent for attractive appearance of a package produced from the laminate.<br>
The invention is also directed to a packaging container filled with beverage or liquid food produced from the packaging laminate of the invention as well as to a method of manufacturing of the laminated packaging material of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above mentioned object is achieved by means of an intermediate polymer layer laminated between the first and the second gas barrier coated polymer carrier layers. The intermediate polymer layer includes a thermoplastic polymer with high elastomeric properties and having a relatively fair bending stiffness. The whole packaging structure combines both advantages of a structural sandwich construction and of a shock absorber to obtain a film with good bending stiffness and keeping its integrity in aggressive transport conditions.<br>
The facings of a sandwich panel, here represented by the two polymer carrier layer films, act similarly to the flanges of an I-beam, resisting the bending loads and increasing the bending stiffness of the structure, by being distanced from each other by an intermediate layer. However, unlike an I-beam structure, the lower density core in addition gives continuous support to the flanges or facings.<br>
It has been observed, that the elastomeric property of the intermediate layer increases the resistance of the package to crack formation during cyclic loading, i.e. exposure to<br><br>
repeated stresses or vibrations such as might be the case during transport, by absorbing the mechanical stresses with elastical, reversible deformations.<br>
The solution to the above mentioned problem and need, is thus to provide a thin, packaging laminate with good gas barrier properties by means of laminating the two polymer carrier layer films, coated with the SiOx gas barrier layers, into a construction with an intermediate, distancing layer including a thermoplastic polymer with high elastomeric properties and having a relatively fair bending stiffness, the laminate further having outer heat salable layers of thermoplastic polymer.<br>
Preferably, the polymer carrier layers comprise polyester, polyamide or polypropylene materials and therefore have a certain degree of inherent stiffness, however, other relatively stiff polymers may also be employed for the carrier layers according to the invention. More preferably, they are oriented films and thus have a higher degree of crystallinity than non-oriented polymer films. The structural sandwich construction of two relatively stiff carrier layers laminated to each side of such an intermediate polymer layer comprising a thermoplastic polymer with high elastomeric properties provides for a laminate having good resistance to cracking during repeated mechanical stress and surprisingly good bending stiffness in relation to its thickness. In addition, the arrangement of the two PECVD-deposited SiOx- layers has proved to result in a much more than two-fold increased gas barrier, compared to a laminate or film containing merely one SiOx-layer. Thus, the construction having a distancing intermediate layer also acting as a "buffer" for penetration of gas, in particular oxygen gas, provides for surprisingly improved gas barrier properties, which prove a synergistic effect resulting from this particular construction. Thus, the laminate has excellent gas barrier properties and is both economical and easy to handle in a high speed, continuous packaging process.<br>
Preferably, the thickness of the intermediate layer does not constitute more than from about 30 to about 55% of the total thickness of the packaging laminate, more preferably from about 35 to about 50%.<br><br>
Preferably, the thickness of the carrier layers constitutes from about 5 to about 20, more preferably from about 5 to about 16% of the total packaging laminate. The carrier layers do not contribute to the total bending stiffness of the packaging laminate only by their mere thickness, but also by their interaction with the relatively thicker distancing intermediate layer.<br>
Preferably, the carrier layer of oriented polymer is a premanufactured film of polyester, polyamide (PA) or polypropylene (PP), such as a cast or co-extrusion cast film or more preferably a rnono-or biaxially oriented polyethyleneterephtalate (PET), polyethylenenaphtenate (PEN), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP) polymer film or a multilayer film comprising a substrate surface layer of such a polymer or a multilayer film comprising at least one such mono-or biaxially oriented layer. By using premanufactured oriented polymer films as the carrier layers, it is ensured that they have some inherent bending stiffness relative to other layers in the laminate that are extrusion or coextrusion laminated, also at lower thicknesses.<br>
Also preferably, the polymer of the intermediate layer is a very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE), ethylene-based co¬polymer or terpolymer, polyolefin-based elastomer or plastomer. More preferably, the polymer of the intermediate layer is a polyethylene copolymer or is VLDPE or ULDPE either alone or in a blend with another olefin polymer component, such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), polypropylene (PP) or copolymers of polypropylene. The other polyolefin component of the blend may be included by up to 35 weight %. A particularly well functioning example of a shock absorbing polymer is "Attane ®" VLDPE from Dow.<br>
Thus, preferably, the polymer of the intermediate layer is a thermoplastic polymer with high elastomeric properties and ability to provide a relatively fair bending stiffness to the laminate, which imparts to the pouch or walls of the packaging laminate flexibility enough to absorb and dampen energy of impacts, without leading<br><br>
to ruptures and leaking along sealing areas, e.g., the transversal top sealing of a wedge-like pouch, and the polymer of the carrier layer is an oriented polypropylene, or preferably, an oriented polyester or polyamide.<br>
Comparative simulation transport tests (more severe, however, than normal reality transport conditions) were carried out on packages made from laminate structures according to the invention having exactly the same outermost sealing layers, two SiOx-coated carrier layers of the same thickness and type and an intermediate layer having the same thickness in all tests. The packages were all produced in the same way. The only difference between the packages tested was that the intermediate layer of the laminate structures was made of VLDPE in some cases, compared to LDPE in some other cases and HDPE in still some other cases. Leakages occurred both among the packages having LDPE and HDPE intermediate layers, while there were practically no leakages from the packages having VLDPE as the intermediate layer. Out of 20 packages tested, i.e., placed on a shaking table and exposed to repetitive vibrations during 30 minutes, having 100% HDPE in the intermediate layer, there were about 16-19 leaking packages. Out of 20 packages tested having 100% VLDPE in the intermediate layer, there were 0-1 leakages.<br>
Experiments showed also that inclusion of up to 35% HDPE, for example, in a VLDPE intermediate layer, still resulted in significantly improved transport simulation test results.<br>
According to a most preferred embodiment of the invention, the gas barrier layers of SiOx are positioned in the laminate such that they are facing each other, with the intermediate polymer layer between them. In this way, optimal gas barrier layers may be obtained and the layers of SiOx will be protected in the best way. However, also embodiments where one or both of the SiOx layers are facing outwards in the laminate structure are conceivable.<br>
The SiOx layer is preferably deposited by PECVD technique, wherein x=1.7 to 2.0, at<br><br>
a thickness of from about 50 to about 500 angstrom (A), preferably from about 80 to about 300 A. There exist alternative methods of depositing inorganic layers, such as SiOx, onto polymer films, which however, generally result in thicker and less flexible layers of the SiOx. This in turn, due to the formation of cracks in the SiOx layer, generally results in laminates of lower quality with regard to oxygen barrier properties. It is thus preferred according to the invention that the SiOx gas barrier layers are applied by means of the continuous method of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, PECVD, of SiOx from a plasma of an organic silicon compound, such as hexadimethylsiloxane (HDMSO).<br>
Preferably, the thickness of the carrier polymer layer is from about 7 to about 30 microns (urn), more preferably from about 8 to about 20, most preferably from about 8 to about 15um, and according to a preferred embodiment, the two carrier polymer films have about the same or exactly the same thickness. It is known that the PECVD process works optimally with the above thickness of the carrier layer, which is also preferred from the economical point of view. In order to ensure a symmetrical and reliable behavior in the filling and packaging operation, it is best to employ carrier layers, i.e., the outer layers of the sandwich construction, that have about the same or exactly the same thickness, although it may be possible for certain desired properties to use carrier layers of different thickness or bending stiffness.<br>
Preferably, the thickness of the intermediate layer is from about 30 to about 80 urn, more preferably from about 35 to about 65 urn, most preferably from about 40 to about 65 um and preferably, while the total thickness of the packaging laminate is from about 100 to about 180 um, most preferably from about 100 to about 150 um.<br>
For the optimal shock-absorbing effect, the thickness of the intermediate layer should be from about 40 to about 65 um, when the intermediate layer comprises a polymer, such as for example VLDPE or VLDPE blended with another polymer, such as HDPE. For other alternative intermediate layer polymers, it may be feasible to use<br><br>
thicker intermediate layers such as up to 80 um, in particular if the total thickness of the packaging laminate is desired to be from about above 150 to about 180 um.<br>
Thus, preferably, the thickness of the intermediate layer (15) is from 35 to 65 um, the thickness of the polymer carrier layer (11,12) is from 8 to 15 um, the thickness of the outside layers of heat-sealable olefin polymer (16,17) is from 10 to 25 um and from 18 to 30 um, respectively, and the total thickness of the packaging laminate is from 100-150 um.<br>
More preferably, the thickness of the intermediate layer (15) is from 40 to 65, um, the thickness of the polymer carrier layer (11,12) is from 12 to 15 um, the thickness of the outside layersof heat-sealable olefin polymer (16,17) is from 10 to 25 um and from 18 to 30 um, respectively, and the total thickness of the packaging laminate is from 100 to 150 um.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the thickness of the intermediate layer (15) is from 40 to 65 um, the thickness of the polymer carrier layer (11,12) is from 8 to 12 um, the thickness of the outside layers of heat-sealable olefin polymer (16,17) is from 10 to 25 um and froml8 to 30 um, respectively, and the total thickness of the packaging laminate is from 100 to 150 um.<br>
Preferably, for an optimal bending stiffness and elastic properties, the ratio between the thickness of the intermediate layer and the carrier layer is from 2 to 8.5 and the ratio of the total thickness of the packaging laminate to the thickness of the intermediate layer is from 1.5 to 5 when the total thickness is from 100 to 150 um, or, the ratio between the thickness of the intermediate layer and the carrier layer is from 4 to 10 and the ratio of the total thickness of the packaging laminate to the thickness of the intermediate layer is from 1.7 to 3 when the total thickness is from 150 to 180 um.<br>
A further preferred important advantage is that such a packaging laminate may be<br><br>
transparent to provide packages having at least a portion that is transparent to make the filled contents visible.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a packaging container filled with beverage or liquid food, preferably an aseptic packaging container, produced from the packaging laminate of the invention.<br>
The packaging container according to the invention is a pouch or stand-up pouch or similar and is durable at handling and distribution and resistant to moisture and oxygen gas during long term storage, due to the high quality packaging laminate, which in turn also provides for high seal quality and excellent gas barrier properties. A further important advantage of packaging containers produced from the packaging laminate according to the invention is that they are durable to microwave cooking or thawing, as well as retorting.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing of the laminated packaging material of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantages and favorable characterizing features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, with reference to the appended figures, in which".<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of a preferred laminated packaging material according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a preferred example of a packaging container produced from the packaging laminate according to the invention.<br><br>
Figures 3a,  3b, and 3c show alternative preferred embodiments of methods of manufacturing of the packaging laminate.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 thus shows a packaging laminate 10, comprising a first and second carrier layer IV, 12 being a film of a preferably oriented polyester, such as for example polyethyleneterephtalate (PET, OPET or BOPET), or a film of a preferably oriented polyamide (PA), onto which are coated thin gas barrier layers of SiOx 13; 14 by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The two SiOx layers are preferably directed towards the interior of the laminate, thus facing each other. Between the two carrier layers coated with gas barrier layers, is laminated an intermediate layer 15 including a thermoplastic, preferably polyolefin- based, polymer having high elastomeric properties, such as for example very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE), polyethylene-based copolymers or terpolymers, polyolefin-based elastomers or plastomers. The intermediate layer is thicker than any of the surrounding layers in the packaging laminate, and provides as such a distancing element between the two carrier layer films of oriented polymer.<br>
The preferred oriented polymer films have a certain degree of inherent stiffness in that they are oriented and thus may have a relatively higher degree of crystallinity than non-oriented polymer films. The sandwich construction of two relatively stiff carrier layers laminated on each side of a thicker and relatively soft and/or elastomeric intermediate polymer layer provides for a laminate having surprisingly good bending stiffness in relation to its thickness. For example, two BOPET films of 12 urn thickness were laminated close together by merely a thin lamination layer in between of about 10 g/m2 of polyolefin-based polymer, e.g., VLDPE. The stiffness value measured on this laminate was 0.6 mNm. Further polyolefin-based outer layers did not alter this result significantly. However, if the same two BOPET films were laminated<br><br>
to each other by means of a thick lamination layer of about 55 g/m2 of, e.g., VLDPE, the stiffness value measured was 2 mNm, i.e., significantly stiffer. The stiffness contribution of a 55 g/m2 thick layer of VLDPE on the outside of the laminate (of the two BOPET layers), on the other hand, would not alter the stiffness value much from 0.6mNm. In addition, the arrangement of the two PECVD-deposited SiOx-layers has proved to result in a much more than two-fold increased gas barrier, compared to a laminate or film containing merely one SiOx-layer. Thus, the arrangement of an intermediate layer also acting as a "buffer" for penetration of gas, in particular oxygen gas, provides for surprisingly improved gas barrier properties, which indicates a synergistic effect resulting from this particular arrangement. As an example, if two films of SiOx-coated BOPET, each having an OTR value of about 4cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH are laminated to each other by a thin polyolefin-based layer, the OTR value of the total construction will be about 2 cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH. When the same films are laminated together with at least one intermediate polyolefin-based polymer layer of a thickness of about 55 g/m2, the OTR value is improved to about 0.2cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH. Similarly, if two films of SiOx-coated BOPET, each having an OTR value of about 1.6 cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH are laminated to each other by a thin polyolefin-based layer, the OTR value of the total construction will be about 0.8cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH. When the same films are laminated together with at least one intermediate polyolefin-based polymer layer of a thickness of about 55 g/m2, the OTR value is improved to about 0.16cc/m2*24h at 23°C and 50% RH. Thus, the improvement of the gas barrier by the "buffer effect" is at least four-to five-fold the improvement from using just double gas barrier films directly laminated to each other.<br>
On the outside of the carrier layer 11, which will constitute the outside wall of a packaging container produced from the packaging laminate, is applied at least one layer 16 of a heat-sealable olefin polymer, preferably a low density polyethylene (LDPE) or a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), which include also so-called metallocene-catalysed LLDPE's (m-LLDPE), i.e., LLDPE polymers catalyzed by means of a single site catalyst. Other examples of alternative polymers for the outside<br><br>
packaging wall layer may be medium high density polyethylene (MDPE) or polypropylene (PP).<br>
On the outside of the carrier layer 13, which will constitute the inside wall of a packaging container produced from the packaging laminate, is applied at least one layer 17 of a heat-sealable olefin polymer, preferably a layer of LDPE, more preferably a layer of LLDPE and most preferably a first part-layer 17a of LDPE and a second outermost part-layer 17b of LLDPE.<br>
The outside layers 16,17 are applied each in a quantity of from about 10 to about 30 um, for optimal heat sealability properties in relation to cost efficiency.<br>
For good adhesion between the various layers of the packaging laminate, there are preferably used binder layers of adhesive polymers, tie layers and primers, known in the art. Such binder layers and primers are adapted to the specific choices of polymer in the various layers and may be selected from polyolefins and modified polyolefins, preferably polyethylene-based polymers, such as for example LDPE and modified LDPE.<br>
Such examples of binder layers are LPDE homo-or copolymers or graft copolymers of polyethylene, grafted with monomers comprising carboxylic or glycidyl functional groups, such as acrylic monomers or maleic anhydride (MAH) monomers, for example ethylene (meth) acrylic acid copolymer (E(M)AA), ethylene-glycidyl (meth) acrylate    copolymer    (EG(M)A)    or    MAH-grafted    polyethylene(MAH-g-PE).<br>
Preferably, for optimal adhesion in the binder layers 18; 19 between the layers of SiOx 13: 14 and the intermediate polyolefin layer 15, there is used a polyethylene base polymer graft modified by an unsaturated alkoxysilane compound, such as described in US Patent No. 5,731,092, herein incorporated by reference. See especially column 1, line 39 to column 3, line 21 and Examples 1 and 2.<br>
Most preferably, the polyethylene base polymer graft modified by an unsaturated<br><br>
alkoxysilane compound is blended with a non-grafted polyethylene, such as preferably low density polyethylene (LDPE). Surprisingly, it has been found that the number of adhesion points between the grafted sites in the binder and the silicon oxide can be vastly increased if the grafted polyolefin is blended with anon-grafted polyolefin, i.e., the number of adhesion points increases despite less grafted sites in the binder polymer.<br>
This most preferred embodiment is based on the insight that it is not only the number of grafted sites that affects the degree of adhesion, but also their ability to physically come in contact with the silicon oxide. It has been found that the grafting of polyolefin according to US 5,731, 092 results in a cross-linking of the polyolefin, which makes the polyolefin less flexible than the non-grafted polyolefin. Due to the impaired flexibility of the grafted polyolefin, the number of contact points between the binding layer composed of the grafted polyolefin and the silicon oxide will be less than for a binding layer solely composed of a non-grafted polyolefin of the same type. However, in a binding layer solely composed of a non-grafted polyolefin, the adhesion in an individual adhesion point of the plurality of adhesion points will not be as good as in an individual adhesion point of a binding layer composed solely of a grafted polyolefin.<br>
The preferred embodiment in addition solves the problem related to these contradictory aspects of grafted and non-grafted polyolefin binders, by providing a binder that is a blend of a grafted polyolefin and a non-grafted polyolefin. Here, the improved flexibility that is achieved due to the presence of a non-grafted polyolefin provides for an increased number of adhesion points, while the grafted polyolefin provides for improved adhesion in those points, all in all resulting in adhesion properties that are better than the adhesion properties of a grafted polyolefin binder per se and a non-grafted polyolefin binder per se.<br>
Whenever binder layers are used between the intermediate shock absorbing layers and<br><br>
the SiOx layers, the thickness referred to as the thickness of the intermediate layer also includes the thicknesses of such binder layers.<br>
Any of the above discussed polymers may also be used in optional binder layers 20,21 between the outer heat-sealable polyolefin layers 16,17 and the polymer carrier layers<br>
11,12.<br>
Figure 2 shows a preferred example of a packaging container 20 produced from the packaging laminate 10 according to the invention. The packaging container is particularly suitable for small beverage packages for direct use by means of a drinking straw or the like.
