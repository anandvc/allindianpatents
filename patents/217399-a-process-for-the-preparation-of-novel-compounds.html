				<td>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the preparation of new compounds which are derivatives of indole, and of pharmaceutical formulations containing them,  and use of the compounds in the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations for treating various diseases.<br>
The novel compounds described herein are structurally and functionally related to melatonin. 3-(2-acetaminoethyl)-5-methoxyindole, a hormone produced primarily by the pineal gland. Melatonin is the principal hormone secreted by the pineal gland in all vertebrates. In all mammals studied to date, including humans, a nocturnal rise in the production of melatonin by the pineal gland is evident; melatonin production by the body is acutely suppressed by light. Melatonin is involved in the coordination of photoperiod dependent and physiological processes. The ability of the animals or humans to respond to the melatonin signal may depend upon melatonin receptors. Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, white blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels. Retention patterns of radioactive-melatonin injected to rats demonstrate melatonin accumulation in the brain, pituitary, lung, heart, gonads and accessory sex organs (Withyachumnarnkul et al., Life Sci 12:1757-65, 1986).<br>
The synthesis and secretion of melatonin exhibit a circadian rhythm that changes with the seasons and with age, e.g., pubescence and senescence. There is very strong evidence that melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, especially those that exhibit circadian and circannual rhythmicity.<br>
Melatonin has been implicated in many human disorders. Some are known to be linked to chronobiological abnormalities. Melatonin has been administered to re-synchronize circadian rhythms that are out of phase with the local photoperiodical cycle. For example, sleep/wake disorders with rapid crossing of time zones (jet lag), or in delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) patients, changes in work shifts, or those experienced by blind people can be<br><br>
treated with melatonin or melatonin analogs (see U.S. Patents Nos. 4,600,723 and 4,666,086 of Short et al. and 5,242,941 of Lewy et al.). However, it appears that melatonin also has direct sedative/hypnotic properties in normal human subjects (e.g., Waldhauser et al., Psychopharmacology, 100: 222-226, 1990; Vollrath et al., Bioscience 29:327-329, 1981: Dollins et al., Proc. Natl .Acad. Sci, 99:1824-1828, 1994, U.S Patent No. 5,403,851 of D'Orlando et al). Three melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far mt-1, MT-2 and Me11c (Barrett et al., Biol. Signals Recept., 1999, 8: 6-14). MT-2 is localized mainly in the central nervous system and mt-1, localized in the CNS as well as in peripheral organs such as kidney and the urogenital tract (Dubocovich et al., IUPHAR media, London, UK, 187-93, 1998). The presently known subtypes are not sufficient to evaluate the large variety of melatonin effects and additional receptor subtypes await discovery.<br>
Melatonin has been demonstrated in a number of rodent experimental paradigms to have both anxiolytic (Golus and King, Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 41:405-408, 1992, Naranjo-Rodriguez et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 18:1167, 1992; Golombek et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol, 237:231-236, 1993) and antiseizure activity (Brallowsky, Electroencephalo. clin. Neurophysiol. 41:314-319, 1976: Farielloet al., Neurology 27:567-570, 1977, Rudeen et al., Epilepsia 21:149-154, 1980; Sugden, J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 227:587-591, 1983; Golombek et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol 210:253-258, 1992).<br>
Melatonin is effective in the treatment of cluster headache and migraine (Claustrat et al., Headache, 29:241-4, 1989). Melatonin may play a role in other psychiatric conditions, particularly depression, but also mania and schizophrenia (see Dobocovich "Antidepressant Agents", U.S. Patent No. 5,093,352; Miles and Philbrick, Biol. Psychiatry 23:405-425, 1988: Sandyk and Kay, Schizophr. Bull. 16:653-662, 1990). In some instance, psychiatric disorders may have underlying chronobiological etiologies (e.g. seasonal effective disorder) and are definite candidates for melatonin therapy.<br>
Melatonin is involved in the regulation of circadian and circannual changes in body temperature. Administration of exogenous melatonin to humans lowers core body temperature (Strassman et al., J. Appl. Physiol, 71:2178-2182, 1991; Cagnacci et al., J Clin. Endocrinol. Merab. 75:447-452, 1992). Melatonin may also possess analgesic properties (Sugden, J.<br><br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 227:587-591, 1983). Therefore, melatonin-like compounds may be useful as an alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic drugs, such as aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen.<br>
It is known that melatonin levels decrease with advancing age (Sack et al., J. Pineal Res. 4:379-388, 1986; Waldhauser et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 66:648-652, 1988; Van Coavorden et al., Am. J. Physiol. 260:E651-661, 1991} which may contribute to some disorders, Neurodegenerative diseases often associated with aging, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, may be treated with melatoninergic compounds (Maurizi, Med. Hypotheses 31:233-242, 1990; Sandyk, Int. J. Neurosci. 50:37-53, 1990; Skene et al., Brain Rev. 528:170-174, 1990).<br>
Sleep disorders in the elderly have been shown to respond to melatonin treatment (Garfinkel et al., Lancet, 346:541-543, 1995, U.S. Patent No. 5,498,423 of Zisapel). 'Soporific effects of melatonin (0.3-240 mg) have been reported in humans following intravenous, intranasal and oral administration. Apart from its soporific effects, exogenous melatonin may affect sleep via its phase-resetting action on the biological clock. Melatonin administration advanced sleep in delayed sleep syndrome patients, and synchronized sleep to the day-night cycles in blind subjects. The efficacy of melatonin (0.3-5 mg/os) for treatment of insomnia has been demonstrated in studies performed mainly with elderly patients, patients treated with atenolol and chronic heart patients, most of which patients have low or distorted melatonin rhythms. In some of these studies, formulations which release melatonin throughout the night were used, in order to circumvent fast clearance of the hormone and to mimic its endogenous profile (Nutrition, 1998, 14: 1-2; The Aging Male, 1998, 1: 1-8). Melatonin, 3 mg, given to patients with sleep disorders and dementia for 21 days, significantly augmented sleep quality and decreased the number of wakening episodes, while agitated behavior at night (sundowning) decreased significantly (Biol. Signals Recept. 1999, 8(1-2): 126-31).<br>
We have recently found that melatonin treatment may be beneficial not only for improving sleep quality, but may also lead to an improvement in the general state of diabetic patients, as indicated by the decrease in HbA1c levels after long-term treatment.<br><br>
Daily melatonin supplementation to male Sprague-Dawley rats, starting at middle age (10 months) and continuing into old age (22 months) via the drinking water at a dosage of 4µg/ml, restored the age-related elevated levels of relative (% of body weight) retroperitoneal and epididymal fat, as well as plasma insulin and leptin levels to youthful (4 month) levels (Rasmussen et al., Endocrinology, 1999, 140(2): 1009-12).<br>
Even osteoporosis may have a melatoninergic component (Sandyk et al., Int. J. Neurosci. 62:215-225, 1992). In fact, melatonin has been suggested to be an anti-aging, anti-stress hormone (Armstrong and Redman, Med. Hypotheses 34:300-309, 1991; Reiter, Bioassays, 14:169-175, 1992). This may be due to its action as a free radical scavenger (Pooggeler et al., J. Pineal Res. 14:151-168, 1993) or its interaction with the immune system (Maestroni and Conti, J. Neuroimmun. 28:167-176 1990; Fraschini et al., Acta. Oncol. 29:775-776 1990, Guerrero and Reiter, Endocr. Res. 18:91-113, 1992). Melatonin may protect from ischemic stroke (Cho et al., Brain Research 755:335-338, 1997), decrease cell-death in Alzheimer's disease (Pappola et al., J Neurosci 17:1683-90, 1997) and lower the risk of SIDS in young infants with low endogenous melatonin levels (Israel Patents Nos. 115861/2 and U.S Patent No. 5,500,225 of Laudon et al).<br>
Related to the above, are the findings that melatonin has oncostatic properties in a variety of cancers, the most studied being its effect on estrogen receptor positive breast cancers (Blasak and Hill, J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 21:433-449, 1986; Gonzalez et al. Melanoma. Res. 1:237-243, 1991; Lissoni et al. Eur. J. Cancer 29A: 185-189, 1993; Shellard et al. Br. J. Cancer 60:288-290, 1989; Philo and Berkowitz, J. Urol. 139:1099-1102, 1988; see U.S. Patents. Nos. 5,196,435 of Clemens et al. and 5,272,141 of Fraschini et al.). It is also possible that melatonin has antiproliferatlve effects on noncancerous cells as well and may be of use to treat benign tumors and proliferative diseases such as BPH (U.S. Patent No. 5,750,557 and European Patent No. EP 0565296B of Zisapel) and Psoriasis.<br>
A major portion of research on melatonin has been devoted to studying is effects on reproduction, particularly in seasonally breeding species (such as<br><br>
hamsters and sheep), in which melatonin is known to regulate fertility and puberty, hibernation, and coat color. These effects have obvious significance for animal husbandry use. Reproductive endocrine uses in humans for melatonin include: contraceptive and fertility agents, treatment for precocious puberty, treatment for premenstrual syndrome and hyperprolactinemia (Pevre et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 47:1383-1386, 1978; Purry et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 144:762-766, 1987: Waldhauser et al., Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 73:793-796, 1991; Bispink et al., Pineal Res. 8:97-106, 1990; Cagnacci et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 73:210-220, 1991; Voordouw et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 74:107-108, 1992; see U.S. Patents Nos. 4,855,305 and 4,945,103 of Cohen et al., and 5,272,141 of Fraschini et al.). It is likely that melatonin compounds may also be useful in other endocrine conditions, particularly those involving growth hormone (Cramer et al., Arzeneim-Forsch, 26:1076-1078,1976; Wright etal., Clin. Endocrinol. 24:375-382, 1986; Paccotti et al., Chronobiologica 15:279-288, 1988; Valcavi et al., Clin. Endocrinol. 39:139-199, 1993). Melatonin may serve to reduce prostate enlargement (see above-cited US and EP patents of Zisapel) Orally administered melatonin to castrated juvenile rats inhibited the androgen-dependent growth of the ventral prostate and the seminal vesicles. (Gilad et al., J. of Urol. 159:1069-73, 1998). Recently, we have demonstrated high affinity melatonin receptors in the human benign prostate epithelial cells, which may affect cell growth and viability (Endocrinology, 137:1412-17, 1996).<br>
In addition to the pineal gland, the eye also synthesizes melatonin. Recently melatonin has been implicated in the control of intraocular pressure and may be of use in glaucoma (Samples et al., Curr, Eye, Res. 7:649-653, 1988; Rhode et al., Ophthalmic. Res. 25:10-15, 1993).<br>
The kidney also expresses melatonin receptors and melatonin has been shown to affect vasopressin and urine excretion (Song et al., FASEB J 11:93-100, 1997, Yasin etal., Brain Res. Bull 39:1-5, 1997).<br>
It is clear that there exists a broad range of therapeutic uses for melatonin. Accordingly it is of continuing interest to identify novel compounds that interact with melatoninergic system as potential therapeutic agents. These compounds may offer longer duration, selective localization and greater efficacy to those of melatonin.<br><br>
Novel compounds related to melatonin, but with pharmacological or pharmacokinetic profiles different from melatonin, are likely to be important new Pharmaceuticals, For examples, see U.S. Patent No. 5,403,851 which discloses the use of substituted tryptamines, phenylalkylamines and related compounds, in order to treat number of pharmaceutical indications including sleep disorders, endocrine indications, immune-system disorders etc. PCT Patent Application No. WO 87/00432 describes compositions, for treating or preventing psoriasis, which contain melatonin or related compounds. European Patent Application No. 0330625A2 discloses the production of melatonin and analogs thereof, for various therapeutic purposes, including the administration of melatonin in combination with an azidothymidine for the treatment of AIDS. Melatonin analogs based on the bioisosteric properties naphthalenic ring and the indole ring has been disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 1992. 35:1484-1485, EP 662471 A2 950712 of Depreux et al., WO 9529173 A1 951102 of Ladlow et al., U.S. Patents Nos. 5,151,446 of Horn et al., 5,194,614 of Adrieuxetal. and 5,276,051 of Lesieur et al.<br>
There is evidence suggesting both melatonin agonists and antagonists would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions. The present invention addresses the need for more therapeutically selective compounds than melatonin.<br>

 (a) Preparation of tarting material<br>
In a suitably equipped flask, there were dissolved 25 g (0.131 mole) 5-methoxytryptophol in 300 ml dimethylacetamide (DMA), and to this solution were added 17.1 g (0.138 mole) g-fluorobenzaldehyde and 36.2 g potassium<br>
carbonate, and a further 120 ml DMA. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then at 100°C for 264 hours. The mixture was then cooled, poured into 500 ml water and stirred vigorously for about one hour, when a light-yellow solid formed. The suspension was extracted with a total of about 2.5 I ethyl acetate, adding some NaCI to the aqueous layer as an aid to separation. The combined organic layer is dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to give about 110 g of dark-brown liquid still containing some DMA. The liquid is dissolved in 500 ml toluene, filtered and 500 ml water is added to the filtrate and stirred. A few drops of 20% NaOH are added to give an alkaline pH, then NaCI is added to prevent the formation of an emulsion. After stirring for one hour, the organic layer is separated. The extracted with toluene is repeated twice. The combined organic layers are evaporated to dryness in vacuo to give 30 g of a brown oil, which is purified by chromatography on 500 g silica gel, using the following gradient of eluent: 1 I chloroform; 1 I 95:5 chloroform/acetone; 3 I 90:10 chloroform/acetone; 500 ml 84:16 chloroform/acetone; 1 I 80:20 chloroform/acetone; 200 ml 50:50 chloroform/acetone; 300 ml 40:60 chloroform/acetone. The combined fractions containing 3-(2-p-formylphenoxyethyl)-5-methoxyindole (TLC: 90:10 chloroform/acetone Rf = 0.21; yellow spot) are evaporated in vacuo to give 12.3 g of a brown oil, which is used in the next step, (b) Preparation of Intermediate<br>
To 12.3 g (0.0417 mole) of the product of step (a) dissolved in 500 ml toluene, in a suitably equipped flask, there were added 8.4 g (0.0717 mole) 2,4-thiazolidinedione, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, adding 50 ml toluene to aid dissolution. Piperidine (5.2 ml) was added, the temperate was raised 110°C and the mixture stirred at this temperature for about three hours. After cooling, a yellow solid precipitated; this was filtered off, washed with ethyl acetate and dried to give as a yellow solid 11 g of 2-(p-(2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-ylidenemethyl)phenoxy)ethyl-5-methoxyindole of formula<br>

(c) 2-(o_-(2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-ylmethyl)phenoxy)ethyl-5- methoxyindole.<br>
Under an argon atmosphere, 70 ml of 1,4-dioxane were refluxed in a suitably equipped flask, 1 g of the product of step (b) was added , to give a clear solution after about 30 minutes, which was cooled to 50°C, followed by addition of 70 ml methanol, this flask being kept at 50°C. In a second flask, there was placed under an argon atmosphere, 1 g Mg turnings covered with methanol; two crystals of iodine were added, and after foaming began the mixture was stirred until the iodine color disappeared. The contents of the first flask were then poured into the second flask, and the temperature raised to 64°C. A further 1.4 g Mg turnings were added over 4 hours, and the reaction mixture was allowed to reflux for 5 days, until conversion as determined by UV was &gt;95%. The mixture was cooled and poured into 500 ml of 20% NH4CI solution, extracted with 3 x 200 ml dichloromethane, washed with 5% aq. citric acid and water and rotoevaporated to give a solid which was dissolved in methanol and crystallized at -18°C. There were obtained 400 mg of the title compound as yellow crystals.<br>
BIOLOGICAL TESTING OF COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION Experiment 1: The effects of orally administered compounds of the invention, MLP-76,77, 79 and 92, on androgen-dependent prostatal regrowth in adult castrated male rats was investigated. Male rats (2.5 months old) were castrated under anesthesia and left to recover for 7 days. During this period, the average weight of the prostate decreased by approximately 75%. Beginning on day 7 after castration, the rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of either oil vehicle (control) or oil vehicle containing testosterone propionate (1 mg/kg body weight per day) for 4 days at 1 hour before lights off. One group of rats was divided into subgroups (3-4 per cage), each subgroup was given either a compound of the invention, melatonin (10 mg dissolved in 100 µl ethanol per liter of drinking water) or vehicle only (100/J ethanol per liter of drinking water) through the drinking water. A second group of rats was divided into subgroups (3-4 per cage), each subgroup was given either MLP-92, melatonin (0.1 or 0.01 mg dissolved in 100 µl ethanol per liter of drinking water) or vehicle only (100 µl ethanol per liter of drinking water)<br>
through the drinking water. It was estimated that each rat in the sub-groups receiving a compound of the invention had an intake of approximately 4 ml solution, i.e. about 40 meg derivative per day. In the morning following the last injection, the rats were sacrificed and the seminal vesicles and ventral prostates were removed and weighed.<br>
The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Testosterone increased the weight of the seminal vesicles and ventral prostate in the castrated animals compared to untreated-controls. Melatonin and the four compounds of the invention decreased significantly the testosterone-mediated re-growth of the ventral prostate gland in the presence of testosterone (Table 2). MLP-92 and MLP-76 were more potent then Mlp-79, MLP-77 and melatonin. The effects of both melatonin and MLP-92 on the prostate re-growth were dose-dependent, whereas melatonin was less effective than the inventive compound (IC50= 88nM, 230nM, for MLP-92 and melatonin respectively).<br>
This experiment indicates a direct inhibitory action of orally administered compounds of the invention on prostatal growth in adult rats, which resemble the effect of meiatonin.<br>

Experiment 2<br>
The distribution of MLP-92 and MLP-77 in various organs of the rat was examined. 100 mcl saline containing 1X106 dpm 125l-labelled compounds of the invention (labelling as described by Vakkuri et al., Acta Endocrinol. 106, 152-7, 1984) were injected (ip) to adult male rats. The rats were sacrificed 1h after injection and various organs were dissected out and weighted. The contents of the radioactive derivatives in the rat organs (Brain, Hypothaiamus, Pituitary, Eyes, Thyroid, Heart, Lungs, Kidneys, Spleen, Testis, Prostate and seminal vesicle) were determined using a gamma-counter and the results are presented as dpm/g organ wet-weight. For comparison, the results of a similar experiment (Withyachumnarnkul et al., Life Sci. 38: 1757-65,1986) using 3H -melatonin are also shown (Table 4).<br>
The results demonstrate selective accumulation of MLP-92, 79 and 77 in the prostate compared to the high accumulation of melatonin in the pituitary. These retention patterns raise the possibility that the present compounds could be of potential therapeutic use for the treatment benign and tumor prostate growth.<br><br>
