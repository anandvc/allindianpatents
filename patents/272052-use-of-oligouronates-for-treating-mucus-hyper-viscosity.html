				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method of treatment of human or non-human animals, in particular mammals, with oligouronates to combat elevated mucosal viscosity, e.g. to enhance mucus clearance, especially from the respiratory tract such as in the case of COPD's (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) , in particular the sinuses and the lungs, in particular in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sinusitis.<br>
Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease in European populations.  The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel that is present in secretary and other cells in the body.  The disease is characterized by the presence of thick, intractable mucus secretions in the body that can lead to lung disease, digestive problems and infertility.  The normal pattern of mucociliary clearance in the lungs fails to clear the unduly viscous mucus which becomes colonized by microorganisms, which in turn increases mucus viscosity and may lead to chronic lung inflammation and obstruction.  Lung disease is thus the biggest health problem for the majority of CF patients and is the major cause of death.<br>
Mucus is a normal secretion of the entire respiratory tract, including the lungs.  Its primary function is as part of the mucociliary clearance system that keeps the lungs clean and protects against infection.  The mucociliary clearance system has three main components: mucus; cilia; and the airway surface liquid.  The epithelial surface thus comprises mucus secreting goblet , cells and ciliated epithelial cells with an overlying layer of airway surface liquid and above that a layer of<br>
 mucus, into which the tips of the cilia protrude.  The mucus is a sticky gel material composed primarily of water (about 95% wt.) and mucins, gel forming molecules responsible for the physical properties of the mucus. The cilia are small hair-like projections from the surface of the epithelial cells, which beat rhythmically in the watery, non-viscous airway surface liquid with their tips immersed in the mucus layer.  The mucus layer forms a sticky blanket on the lung surface that traps bacteria, viruses, inhaled particles, environmental pollutants and cell debris.  The beating of the cilia serves to propel this mucus blanket and anything trapped in it towards the mouth and out of the lungs.  Under normal conditions, the mucociliary clearance system functions effectively and the lungs are kept clean and free of infection.  If the system is overwhelmed, there is a second line of defence - cough. Thus when increased levels of mucus are secreted in response to irritation or inflammation, e.g. due to inhaled particles or infection, the mucus is projected out of the lungs by the cough reflex.<br>
In CF patients the mucus in the lung is thicker and more viscous than normal, and this thicker mucus is not so easily transported by the cilia.  As a result the mucociliary clearance system is compromised and the lungs are more vulnerable to infection.  In addition, the lungs of CF patients appear to be in a hyper-inflammatory state with a continual low level of inflammation and a heightened response to agents that normally cause inflammation.  This is problematic as part of the response to inflammation is increased production of mucus.  The increased mucus builds up if it is too thick to be cleared by the mucociliary clearance system or coughing, lung capacity is reduced and the exchange of oxygen across the mucosa is decreased.  This provides an ideal environment for bacterial colonisation, a serious problem for CF<br>
 patients as it also causes inflammation and activates the immune response.  This leads not only to increased mucus secretion but also an increased presence of immune response cells and agents such as macrophages and lysozymes.  As bacteria and macrophages die, their cell contents are released into the mucus and these include viscous molecules such as DNA.  Furthermore, some of the bacteria, e.g. Burkcnolderia sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,   also secrete highly viscous polysaccharides, in the latter case alginates. These molecules further increase the viscosity of the mucus, in the case of the alginates apparently by interaction with the mucin matrix of the mucus but in the case of DNA apparently by increasing the viscosity of the sol phase within the mucin matrix.<br>
Maintaining the mucus in a form capable of being transported by the cilia is thus a key goal of treatment of CF.  Agents which simply break down its gel-like structure would result in fluid which was as untransportable as the hyperviscous mucus of the CF patient.  It is important therefore that any treatment agent should not break down the gel matrix formed by the glycoprotein mucins.<br>
We have now found that this can be achieved using oligouronates, i.e. multiply charged hydroxyl group carrying oligomers, in particular one containing two to thirty monomer residues.<br>
Elsewhere in the respiratory tract, in particular in the sinuses, especially the paranasal sinuses, overly viscous mucous can present problems.  Oligouronates, can also be used to address these problems.<br>
Thus, viewed from one aspect the invention provides a method of treatment of a human or non-human (e.g. mammalian) subject to combat mucosal hyperviscosity in<br>
 the respiratory tract, e.g. to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis or cystic fibrosis patients, which method comprises application to a mucosal surface in said tract in said subject of an effective amount of a physiologically tolerable oligouronate polyol.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides the use of a physiologically tolerable oligouronate for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of mucosal hyperviscosity in the respiratory tract.<br>
The application of the oligouronate may be by any means which delivers it to a mucus secreting, or mucus carrying surface in the patient's respiratory tract, e.g. the paranasal sinuses or more preferably the lungs. Introduction will typically be by inhalation, e.g. of liquid-droplets (for example an aerosol) or a powder.<br>
The counterions for the oligouronate may be any of the physiologically tolerable ions commonly used for charged drug substances, e.g. sodium, potassium, ammonium, chloride, mesylate, meglumine, etc.  Ions which promote alginate gelation, e.g. group 2 metals, however will preferably not be used.<br>
While the oligouronate may be a synthetic material, it is preferably a derivative, having a weight average molecular weight of less than 100000 Da, of a naturally occurring polysaccharide.  It is preferably a 3- to 28-mer, in particular a 4- to 25-mer, especially a 6- to 22-mer, in particular an 8- to 15-mer, especially a 10-mer, e.g. having a molecular weight in the range 350 to 6000 Da especially 750 to 4500 Da.  It may be a single compound or it may be a mixture of oligouronate compounds, e.g. of a range of degrees of polymerization. Moreover, the monomeric residues in the oligouronate, e.g. the monosaccharide groups, may be the same or<br>
 different and not all need carry electrically charged groups although it is preferred that the majority (e.g. at least 60%, preferably at least 80% more preferably at least 90%) do.  It is preferred that a substantial majority, e.g. at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% of the charged groups have the same polarity.  In the oligouronate, the ratio of hydroxyl groups to charged groups is preferably at least 2:1, more especially at least 3:1.<br>
Oligouronates are readily accessible from natural sources since many natural polysaccharides contain charged uronate residues, e.g. residues such as guluronic and galacturonic acid residues.<br>
Polysaccharide to oligosaccharide cleavage to produce oligosuronate useable according to the present invention may be performed using conventional polysaccharide lysis techniques such as enzymatic digestion and acid hydrolysis.  Oligouronates may then be separated from the polysaccharide breakdown products<br>
chromatographically using an ion exchange resin or by fractionated precipitation or solubilization.<br>
The oligouronates may also be chemically modified, including but not limited to modification to add charged groups (such as carboxylated or carboxymethylated glycans), and oligouronates modified to alter flexibility (e.g. by periodate oxidation)<br>
Suitable polysaccharides are discussed for example in "Handbook of Hydrocolloids", Ed. Phillips and Williams, CRC, Boca Raton, Florida, USA, 2000.  The use of alginates however is especially preferred as these naturally occur as block copolymers of manuronic (M) and guluronic (G) acids and G-block oligomers can readily be produced from alginate source materials.  Indeed, in general the oligouronate is preferably an oligoguluronic<br>
 acid, or less preferably an oligogalacturonic acid.<br>
Where alginates are used as the starting material for preparation of the oligouronate, the guluronic acid content may if desired be increased by epimerization with mannouronan C-5 epimerases from A. vinelandii.<br>
Oligoguluronic acids suitable for use according to the invention may conveniently be produced by acid hydrolysis of alginic acid from Laminaria hyperborea, dissolution at neutral pH, addition of mineral acid to reduce the pH to 3.4 to precipitate the oligoguluronic acid, washing with weak acid, resuspension at neutral pH and freeze drying.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, especially an inhalable composition, e.g. a solution, suspension, dispersion or powder, comprising a physiologically tolerable oligouronate together with a physiologically tolerable carrier or excipient, and preferably also a further physiologically tolerable mucosal viscosity reducing agent, e.g. a nucleic acid cleaving enzyme (e.g. a DNAse such as DNase I), gelsolin, a thiol reducing agent, an acetylcysteine, sodium chloride, an uncharged low molecular weight polysaccharide (e.g. dextran), arginine (or other nitric oxide precursors or synthesis stimulators), or an anionic polyamino acid (e.g. poly ASP or poly GLU) .  The use of a DNase is especially preferred.  The oligouronate may be administered typically in doses of 1 to lOOOOmg, especially 10 to 1000mg for an adult human.  The optimum does may readily be determined by routine dosage ranging experiments, optionally following initial investigation of an animal model, e.g. a dog model.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be produced using conventional pharmaceutical carriers and excipients,<br>
 e.g. solvents (such as water), osmolality modifiers, flavours, pH regulators, etc.  They may contain additional active components, for example agents which serve to break down biopolymers not involved in the mucin matrix of the mucus (e.g. DNase, particularly rhDNase), antibacterial agents, and antiinflammatories. Combination therapy using a such further agent and the oligouronate, administered separately or together is a particularly preferred aspect of the method of the invention.  Such further agents may be used in their normal doses or even at lower doses, e.g. 50% of normal dose.<br>
The oligouronates are desirably administered as a spray, preferably an aerosol spray made from an aqueous solution or in the form of powders, e.g. of approximately nanometer to micrometer (e.g. 10 to 50000 nm) mode particle size by volume size.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a spray applicator comprising a reservoir and a droplet generator, said reservoir containing an aqueous solution of a physiologically tolerable oligouronate.  Such spray applicators, and indeed the oligouroantes, may be used in the treatment of sinus or nasal blockage or congestion resulting from the common cold or other reasons.<br>
The invention will now be described further with reference to the following non-limiting Examples and the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

 modulus (G*) and the phase angle of the same gels at the end of gelation as a percentage of the control;<br>

Figures 7a and 7b show the phase angle 5 for treated and untreated sputum samples.  Figure 7b showing 5 as a percentage of control.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The effect of five oligomeric materials on a model mucin-alginate gel were tested:-<br>
a)	Low molecular weight dextran {6000 Da)<br>
b)	Low molecular weight PEG {3350 Da)<br>
c)	Low molecular weight DNA<br>
d)	Sodium galacturonate oligomers<br>
e)	Sodium guluronate oligomers (G blocks)<br>
The sodium guluronate oligomer was prepared as described above and had the following characteristics:<br>
FG   0.87,   FM  0.13,   FQG  0.83,   FGM=FMG  0.05,   FMM  0.08,   FGGM=FMMG 0.04,   FMGM  0.02,   FGGG  0.79,   DP  19.<br>
.Materials<br>
Control gel consisted of 18mg/ml mucin + 0.6mg/ml<br><br>
alginate in 0.05M NaCl<br>
Test gels consisted of 18mg/ml mucin + 0.6mg/ml alginate + 4mg/ml test material in 0.05 M NaCl<br>
Rheological  tests<br>
Gelation - immediately after mixing the sample was<br>
loaded into the rheometer at 37°C.  The temperature was<br>
cooled to 10°C (0.5 degree/min) and then held at 10°C<br>
for 18 hours.  The behaviour of the sample and gel<br>
development was measured continuously.<br>
Frequency sweep - after gelation the temperature of the<br>
sample was raised to 37°C and the rheological behaviour<br>
monitored as a function of frequency.<br>
Stress sweep - at 37°C, the behaviour of the gel was<br>
monitored as a function of increasing applied stress.<br>
Gelation<br>
The studies demonstrated that sodium guluronate oligomers (G blocks) are able to displace alginate in mucin - alginate interactions as seen by the decrease in the complex modulus of the gel (G.*) over time after the initial gelation.  For the five test gels and the control gel this is shown in Figures la to If respectively.<br>
Of the other oligomeric materials tested only sodium galacturonate oligomers had a similar effect, showing a decrease in the moduli values over time.  The other materials (DNA, PEG, dextran) caused a delay in gelation but the gel continued to develop over time as shown by the increase in complex modulus.<br>
The complex modulus and phase angle of the gels at the end of the gelling period is plotted in Figures 2 and 3. The complex modulus is a measure of the total response or strength of the system and the phase angle concerns the balance between liquid like and solid like behaviour with a higher phase angle indicating greater liquid like<br>
 behaviour.  Sodium guluronate oligomers (G blocks) caused the greatest drop in G* and the greatest increase in the phase angle.<br>
Gel behaviour from  the frequency sweep<br>
All the gels showed frequency sweep behaviour typical of<br>
weak viscoelastic gels.<br>
Flow stress from the stress sweep<br>
A stress sweep was used to determine the stress needed to induce flow in the system.  This is plotted in Figure 4 as a % of the stress needed to induce flow in the control gel.  This gives an indication of how much the added material has weakened the gel matrix.  G blocks (sodium guluronate oligomers) had the most pronounced effect on the flow stress followed by sodium galacturonate oligomers.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Effect on sputum<br>
Sputum samples were collected from cystic fibrosis<br>
patients with a positive diagnosis for Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa  infection. The samples were gently stirred,<br>
divided into portions, frozen and stored at -40°C.<br>
Pre-testing procedure:<br>
The sputum samples were taken out from the freezer and<br>
placed in the fridge (4°C) one hour before testing,<br>
stirred on a magnetic stirrer for about 10 min and<br>
divided into 0.5 g portions. Testing media was added to<br>
all but one sample, the pure sputum sample.  The<br>
resulting samples were:<br>
A 0.5g sputum (pure)<br>
B 0.5g sputum + 65µl 350mM NaCl solution (ionic strength<br>
of the added guluronate oligomer)<br>
C 0.5g sputum + 75µl 150mg/ml Sodium guluronate<br>
oligomers Dp19<br>
D 0.5g sputum + 75µl 150mg/ml Sodium guluronate<br>
oligomers DplO<br>
The sodium guluronate oligomer Dp 10 (degree of polymerization) had the following characteristics: FQ 0.79,  FM0.11,  FOB 0.76, FGM,=FMG 0.03,  FMM, 0.07, FMGG=FGMM 0.02,  FMGM 0.01, FGGG 0.74,  FG(red) 0.10, FG(tot) 0.89,  NG&gt;1 37,  Dp 10<br>
The mixed samples were then gently stirred for 1 min and subsequently placed into the fridge for 5 min before being transferred to the rheometer for testing.<br>
Rheological testing:<br>
Rheological measurements of the pure and mixed sputum was carried out on plate / cone (40mm/l°) using a Rheologica Stress-Tech general purpose rheometer at 10°C to minimize the effect of proteolytic enzymes.<br>
The rheological characterisation of the pure sputum and sputum mixed with testing media was performed in four different steps:<br>
Oscillating strain control for 2 min with constant strain 0.03 and frequency at 1 Hz.<br>
Oscillating strain control after pre-shear (1 min at 20 s-1 shear rate) for 60 min with constant strain at 0.03 and frequency at 1 Hz.<br>
Frequency sweep with range from 0.01 - 5 Hz at constant strain 0.03.<br>
Stress sweep with range from 0.02 -20 Pa at 1 Hz.<br>
Figure 5a is bar chart showing the complex modulus (G*) for the sputum samples at the end of testing, after 60 min. Figure 5b is bar chart showing the same sputum samples as in figure 5a, but as percentage of the control (pure sputum).<br>
Figure 5c to 5f are plots of complex modulus over time for the sputum samples A to D.<br>
 Figure 6a is bar chart showing the complex viscosity (n*) for the sputum samples at the end of testing, after 60 min. Figure 6b is bar chart showing the same sputum samples as in figure 6a, but as percentage of the control.<br>
Figure 7a is bar chart showing the phase angle (5) for the sputum samples at the end of testing, after 60 min. Figure 7b is bar chart showing the same sputum samples as in figure 3a, but as percentage of the control.<br>
Addition of guluronate oligomers obviously reduces the mechanical properties of CF sputum ex vivo.   Both the complex dynamic modulus as well as the complex dynamic viscosity is considerably reduced, in some cases by as much as a factor of 5. Dp 10 appears to be more effective than the sample with an average Dp of 19. Results obtained from preparing the sputum samples as described also suggest that the CF sputum obtain equilibrium-like mechanical properties faster in the presence of Dp 10 G-blocks than in the presence of other components (G* and n* independent upon time) . The change in the phase angle is, however, not effected to such an extent as G* and n*. This is most important since it clearly shows that the mechanical properties of the mucin network is preserved and hence still able to function as a first line of defence against air-borne pollutants.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Aerosol<br>
A sterile aerosol spray, administered by the aid of a nebuliser, is made from a liquid containing 3-10% of the sodium salt of a guluronic acid block with a purity of at least 75% guluronate and a degree of polymerisation between 5 and 20, and, if necessary, a surface active compound to stabilise the aerosol droplet size.<br><br><br><br><br>
