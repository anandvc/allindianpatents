				<td>CHROMANE SUBSTITUTED BENZIMIDAZOLES AND THEIR USE AS ACID PUMP INHIBITORS<br>
Background of the invention<br>
This invention1 relates to chromane substituted benzimidazole derivatives. These compounds have selective acid pump inhibitory activity.   The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition, method of treatment and use, comprising the above derivatives for the treatment of disease conditions mediated by acid pump modulating activity; in particular acid pump inhibitory activity.<br>
It has been well established that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are prodrugs that undergo an acid-catalyzed chemical rearrangement that permits them to inhibit H+/K+-ATPase by covalently binding to its Cystein residues (Sachs, G. ef. N., Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 1995, 40,3S-23S; Sachs et. N., Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol, 1995, 35, 277-305.)'. However, unlike PPIs, acid pump antagonists inhibit acid secretion via reversible potassium-competitive inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase. SCH28080 is one of such reversible inhibitors and has been studied extensively. Other newer agents (revaprazan, soraprazan, AZD-0865 and CS-526) have entered in clinical trials confirming their efficacy in human (Pope, A.; Parsons, M., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1993,14, 323-5; Vakil, N., Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 2004,19,1041-1049.). In general, acid pump antagonists are found to be useful for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including gastrointestinal disease, gastroesophageal disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers, gastritis, infection of Helicobacter pylori, dyspepsia, functional dyspepsia, Zollinger-EIIison syndrome, non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), visceral pain, cancer, heartburn, nausea, esophagitis, dysphagia, hypersalivation, airway disorders or asthma (hereinafter, referred as "APA Diseases"; Kiljander, Toni O, American Journal of Medicine, 2003,115 (Suppl. 3A), 65S-71S; Ki-Baik Hahm et al., J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr., 2006, 38, (1), 1-8 .)<br>
WO04/054984 refers to some compounds, such as indan-1-yl oxy benzimidazole derivatives, as acid pump antagonists.<br>
There is a need to provide new acid pump antagonists that are good drug candidates and address unmet needs by PPIs for treating diseases. In particular, preferred compounds should bind potently to the acid pump whilst showing little affinity for other receptors and show functional activity as inhibitors of acid-secretion in stomach. They should be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, be metabolically stable and possess favorable pharmacokinetic properties. They should be non-toxic. Furthermore, the ideal drug candidate will exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In this invention, it has now been found out that the new class of compounds having a benzimidazole structure substituted with a chromane moiety show acid, pump inhibitory activity and favorable properties as drug candidates, and thus are useful for the treatment of disease conditions mediated by acid pump inhibitory activity such as APA Diseases.<br>

The degree of ionization in the salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non-ionized.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) thereof include both unsolvated and solyated forms. The term "solvate" is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include hydrates and solvates wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, de-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or<br>
more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci. 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in one or more crystalline forms.   These polymorphs, including mixtures thereof are also included within the scope of the present invention.<br>

Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage.   Such derivatives are referred to as "prodrugs".   Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>

Said moiety convertible in vivo into the hydroxy group means a moiety transformable in vivo into a hydroxyl group by e.g. hydrolysis and/or by an enzyme, e.g. an esterase. Examples of said moiety include, but are not limited to, ester and ether groups which may be hydrolyzed easily in vivo. Preferred are the moieties replaced the hydrogen of hydroxy group with acyloxyalkyl, 1-(alkoxycarbopyloxy)alkyl, phthalidyl and acyloxyalkyloxycarbonyl such as pivalayloxymethyloxycarbonyl.<br>

Inhibition of acid secretion in the gastric lumen-perfused rat<br>
Acid secretion in the gastric lumen-perfused rat was measured according to Watanabe et al. [Watanabe K et al., J. Physiol. (Paris) 2000; 94:111-116].<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 weeks old, deprived of food for 18 hours before the experiment with free access to water, were anesthetized with urethane (1.4 g/kg, i.p.) and tracheotomized. After a middle<br>
abdominal incision, a dual polyethylene cannula was inserted into the forestomach and the stomach was perfused with saline (37 °C, pH 5.0) at a rate of 1 ml/min. The acid output in the perfusate was determined at 5 minutes interval by titration with 0.02 M- NaOH to pH 5.0. After the determination of basal acid secretion for 30 min, the acid secretion was, stimulated by a continuous intravenous infusion of pentagastrin (16 µg/kg/h). The test compounds were administered by an intravenous bolus injection or intraduodenal administration after the stimulated acid secretion reached a plateau phase. The acid secretion was monitored after the administration.<br>

Human dofetilide binding<br>
Human ether a-go-go related gene (HERG) transfected -HEK293S cells were prepared and grown in-house. Cell paste of HEK-293 cells expressing the HERG product can be suspended in 10-fold volume of 50 mM Tris buffer adjusted at pH 7.5 at 25 oC with 2 M HCI containing 1 mM MgCI2,10 mM KCI. The cells were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (at the maximum power for 20 seconds) and centrifuged at 48,000 g for 20 minutes at 4oC. The pellet was resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged once more in the same manner. The resultant supernatant was discarded and the final pellet was resuspended (10-fold volume of 50 mM Tris buffer) and homogenized at the maximum power for 20 seconds. The membrane homogenate was aliquoted and stored at-80°C until use. An aliquot was used for protein concentration determination using a Protein Assay Rapid Kit (wako) and Spectra max plate reader (Wallac). All the manipulation, stock solution and equipment were kept on ice at all times. For saturation assays, experiments were conducted in a total volume of 200 pi. Saturation was determined by incubating 36 µl of [3H]-dofetilide, and 160 pi of membrane homogenates (20-30 ug protein, per well) for 60 minutes at room temperature in the absence or presence of 10 µM dofetilide at final concentrations (4 µl) for total or nonspecific binding, respectively. All incubations were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over PEl soaked glass fiber filter papers using Skatron cell harvester followed by two washes with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4.at 25 °C). Receptor-bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting using<br>
Packard LS counter.<br>
For the competition assay, compounds were diluted in 96 well polypropylene plates as 4-point dilutions in semi-log format. All dilutions were performed in DMSO first and then transferred into 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) containing 1 mM MgCI2, 10 mM KCI so that the final DMSO concentration became equal to 1%. Compounds were dispensed in triplicate in assay plates (4 pi). Total binding and nonspecific binding wells were set up in 6 wells as vehicle and 10 pM dofetjlide at final concentration, respectively. The radioligand was prepared at 5.6x final concentration and this solution was added to each well (36 pi). The assay was initiated by addition of YSi poly-L-lysine SPA beads (50pµ 1 mg/well) and membranes (110pµ 20 pg/well). Incubation was continued for 60 minutes at room temperature. Plates were incubated for a further 3 hours at room temperature for beads to settle: Receptor-bound radioactivity was quantified by counting Wallac MicroBeta plate counter.<br>

Culture medium was removed from both the apical and basolateral compartments and the monolayers were preincubated with pre-warmed 0.3 ml apical buffer and 1.0 ml basolateral buffer for 0.5 hour at 37°C in a shaker water bath at 50 cycles/min. The apical buffer consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) Biological Buffer, 1.25 mM CaCI2 and 0.5 mM MgCI2 (pH 6.5). The basolateral buffer consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) Biological Buffer, 1.25 mM CaCI2 and 0.5 mM MgCI2 (pH 7.4). At the end of the preincubation, the media was removed and test compound solution (10µM) in buffer was added to the apical compartment The inserts were moved to wells containing fresh basolateral buffer at 1 hour. Drug concentration in the buffer was measured by LC/MS analysis.<br>
Flux rate (F, mass/time) was calculated from the slope of cumulative appearance of substrate on the receiver side and apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated from the following equation.<br>
Papp (cm/sec) = (Fx VD) / (SAx MD) where SA is surface area for transport (0.3 cm2), VD Is the donor volume (0.3ml), MD is the total amount of drug on the donor side at t = 0.   All data represent the mean of 2 inserts.   Monolayer integrity was determined by Lucifer Yellow transport.<br>
Half-life In human liver microsomes (HLMM<br>
Test compounds (1 pM) were incubated with 3.3 mM MgCI2 and 0.78 mg/mL HLM (HL101) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37°C on the 96-deep well plate. The reaction mixture was split into two groups, a non-P450 and a P450 group. NADPH was only added to the reaction mixture of the P450 group. An aliquot of samples of P450 group was collected at 0, 10, 30, and 60 minutes time point, where 0 minutes time point indicated the time when NADPH was added into the reaction mixture of P450 group. An aliquot of samples of non-P450 group was collected at -10 and 65 minutes time point Collected aliquots were extracted with acetonitrile solution containing an internal standard.    The<br>
precipitated protein was spun down in centrifuge (2000 rpm, 15 min).   The compound concentration in<br>
supernatant was measured by LC/MS/MS system.<br>
The half-life value was obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of the peak area ratio of<br>
compounds/ internal standard versus time.   The slope of the line of best fit through the points yields the<br>
rate of metabolism (k). This was converted to a half-life value using following equations:<br>
Half-life = In 2 / k<br>

number of 384-well plates.   At several time points, a plate was removed from the incubator and the<br>
reaction was terminated with two incubation volumes of acetonitrile.   The compound concentration in<br>
supernatant was measured by LC/MS/MS system. The intrinsic clearance value was calculated using<br>
following equations:<br>
Clint (ul/min/mg protein) = k x incubation volume<br>

The methodology for stable transfection of this channel in HEK cells can be found elsewhere (Z.Zhou et al., 1998, Biophysical journal, 74, 230-241). On the day of experimentation, the cells are harvested from culture flasks and stored as cell suspension in a standard external solution (see below of its composition), in the room atmosphere of 23°C. Cells are studied between 0.5-5 hours after harvest<br>
HERG currents are studied using a standard patch clamp technique of the whole^cell mode. During the experiment, the cells are superfused with a standard external solution of the following composition;(mM) NaCl, 130; KCI, 4; CaCI2, 2; MgCI2, 1; Glucose, 10; HEPES, 5; pH 7.4 with NaOH. Whole-cell recordings is made using a patch clamp amplifier and patch pipettes which have a resistance of 1-3MOhm when filled with the standard internal solution of the following composition; (mM); KCI, 130; MgATP, 5; MgCI2, 1; HEPES, 10; EGTA5, pH 7.2 with KOH. Only those cells with access resistances below 10 MOhm and seal resistances over 1GOhm are accepted for further experimentation. Series resistance compensation is applied up to a maximum of 80% without any leak subtraction. Following the achievement of whole cell configuration and sufficient time for cell dialysis with pipette solution (&gt;5 min), the membrane is depolarized from a holding potential of - 80 mV to + 30mV for 1000 ms followed by a descending voltage ramp (rate 0.5 mV msec-1) back to the holding potential. This depolarization and ramp is applied to the cells continuously every 4 seconds (0.25 Hz). The amplitude of the peak current elicited around -40 mV during the ramp is measured. Once stable evoked current responses of minimal changes in the amplitude are obtained in the external solution, the test compound is applied for 10-20 minutes with multiple dosing in a single cell. The cells are also exposed to high dose of dofetilide (5 µM), a specific IKr blocker, to evaluate the insensitive endogenous current.<br>
All experiments are performed at 23+/-1°C. Evoked membrane currents are recorded online on a computer, filtered at 500-1000 Hz (Bessel -3dB) and sampled at 1-2 KHz. Osmolality and pH change<br>
induced by the test compound in external solution will be examined at the highest concentration.<br>
The arithmetic mean of these ten values of peak current is calculated under control conditions and in the presence of drug. Percent decrease of IN in each experiment is obtained by the normalized current value using the following formula: lN = (Ic - 'D)/( IC - Idof)x100, where lc is the mean current value under control conditions, lD is the mean current value in the presence of test compound and ld0f is the mean current value in dofetilide application. Separate experiments are performed and pooled data of arithmetic mean from each experiment is defined as the result of the study.<br>
Bioavailability in rat<br>
Adult rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were used. One to two days prior to the experiments all rats were prepared by cannulation of the right jugular vein under anesthesia. The cannula was exteriorized at the nape of the neck. Blood samples (0.2-0.3 mL) were drawn from the jugular vein at intervals up to 24 hours after intravenous or oral administrations of the test compound. The samples were frozen until analysis. Bioavailability was assessed by calculating the quotient between the area under plasma concentration curve (AUC) following oral administration or intravenous administration.<br>
Bioavailability in dog<br>
Adult Beagle dogs were used. Blood samples (0.2-0.5 mL) were drawn from the cephalic vein at intervals up to 24 hours after intravenous or oral administrations of the test compound. The samples were frozen until analysis. Bioavailability was assessed by calculating the quotient between the area under plasma concentration curve (AUC) following oral administration or intravenous administration.<br>
Plasma protein binding<br>
Plasma protein binding of the test compound (1 µM) was measured by the method of equilibrium dialysis using 96-well plate type equipment Spectra-Por®, regenerated cellulose membranes (molecular weight cut-off 12,000-14,000, 22 mm x 120 mm) were soaked for over night in distilled water, then for 20 minutes in 30% ethanol, and finally for 15 minutes in dialysis buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH7.4). Frozen plasma of human, Sprague-Dawley rats, and Beagle dogs were used. The dialysis equipment was assembled and added 150 uL of compound-fortified plasma to one side of each well and 150 uL of dialysis buffer to the other side of each well. After 4 hours incubation at 37°C for 150 r.p.m, aliquots of plasma and buffer were sampled. The compound in plasma and buffer were extracted with 300 uL of acetonitrile containing internal standard compounds for analysis. The concentration of the compound was determined with LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
The fraction of the compound unbound was calculated by the following equation: fu = 1{-([plasma]eq - [buffer]eq) / ([plasma]eq,)}<br>
wherein [plasma]eq and [buffer]eq are the concentrations of the compound in plasma and buffer, respectively.<br>
Aqueous solubility<br>
Aqueous solubility in the mediums (a)-(c) was determined by following method:<br>
Whatman mini-UniPrep chambers (Clifton, NJ, USA) containing more than 0.5 mg of compound and 0.5 mL of each medium were shaken overnight (over 8 hours) at room temperature. All samples were filtered through a 0.45 nm Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membrane into the Whatman mini-UniPrep plunger before analysis. The filtrates were assayed by HPLC.<br><medium>(a) Simulated gastric fluid with no enzyme .(SGN) at pH 1.2: Dissolve 2.0 g of NaCI in 7.0 mL of .10 M HCI and sufficient water to make 1000 mL; (b) Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 6.5: Dissolve 6.35 g of KH2PO4, 2.84 g of Na2HPO4 and 5.50 g of NaCI in sufficient water to make 1000 mL, adjusting the pH to 6.5; (c) 3.94 mg of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) and 1.06 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-L-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) in 1 mL of PBS (pH 6.5).<br>
Estimation of. hepatic clearance using the metabolic stability in human hepatocvtes<br>
Tested compounds (1 µM) were incubated statically with hepatocytes from human at 37 °C in a 95 % air/ 5 % CO2 with target cell density of 0.5 x 106 cells/ml and a total volume of 50 uL. Incubation was stopped at each time point by the addition of ice-cold acetonitrile (ACN). Aliquots of samples were mixed with 10 % ACN containing an internal standard for LC/MS/MS analysis. After samples were sonicated for 10 minutes, samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 minutes, and then the supernatant was transferred to the other plates for analysis. The compound concentrations in supernatant were measured by LC/MS/MS system.<br>
The disappearance rates of tested compounds were obtained by plotting the common logarithm of the peak area ratio of compounds / internal standard versus time. The slope of the line of best fit through the points yielded the rate of metabolism (ke). This value was scaled to take hepatocellularity, liver and body weight into account to give an intrinsic clearance value (CLINT) in ml/min/kg as illustrated in Equation 1. Hepatic clearance (CU) was predicted from this intrinsic clearance value using the parallel tube model as shown in Equation 2. The predicted clearance divided by the hepatic blood flow (Qh) afforded the extraction ratio (Eh) (Equation 3).<br>
Equation 1:        ke   x   (g    liver/kg   body   weight)x(ml    incubation/   number   of   cells   in<br>
incubation)x(cells/g liver)<br>
.   Equation 2:	CU = Qh x { 1 - exp (-CLInl/ Qh)}<br>
Equation 3:	Eh = CLh/Qh<br>
Wherein, "gliver weight /kg body weight" is 21, "Cells / g liver is 1.2 x 108, "ml incubation/ number of cells in incubation" is 2.0 x 10-6, and Qh is 20 ml/min/kg.<br>
Supposing that hepatic metabolism is the main route of drug elimination, systemic exposure<br>
(AUCpo) after oral administration is calculated using Equation 4.<br>
Equation 4	AUCpo = Dose x (1-Eh) / CLh<br>
Method for assaying the compounds phototoxlc potential:<br>
The phototoxic potential was measured in the strict accordance with method described in the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals 432 (2002). Chlorpromazine (CPZ) and Sodium n-Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.<br>
Balb/3T3, clone 31 cells (ATCC, CCL-163) were seeded into 96-wells plates (Nunc, 167008) at a density of 1x104 cells/well. Cells were incubated under a standard condition (37°C, a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2) within the culture medium-DMEM (GIBCO; caj#11885-084) for 24 hour, Following the incubation, the culture medium-DMEM was discarded and the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS; Sigma, Cai#E3024), then added 100 µl solution of the test compound in EBSS or solvent control (EBSS contained 1% dimethylsulphoxide or 1% ethanol). The plate was prepared in duplicate. All the plates were incubated under the standard condition for 60 min in the dark. One of the duplicated plates was used for determination of cytotoxicity (-Irr) and kept at room temperature in the dark for 50 min. For the determination of photocytotoxicity (+lrr), another one was exposed to the sun simulator (UVA irradiance: 1.7mW/cm2; SOL500, Dr. Honle UV Technology, Germany) for 50 min (UVA dose = 5 joules / cm2). Then the solutions were discarded from the two plates and immediately washed with 150 µl of EBSS with care. The cells were further incubated with 150 µl well of DMED medium for 18 - 22 hr.<br>
After the incubation, the culture medium was discarded, the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of EBSS and then immediately incubated with 100 µl/well of a 50 ug/rrtl of neutral red (NR) (3-amino-7-dimethylamino-2-methylphenazine hydrochloride, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) in DMEM without serum for 3 hour under the standard condition. After incorporation of neutral red into the cell lysosomes, the NR-DMED medium was discarded and the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of EBSS. The exact 150ul of ethanol/acetic acid/water (50:1:49) was added to each well of plate and the extraction was performed for 10 minutes by gently shaking at room temperature. Then optical density (OD) of the NR extract was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (Plate-reader, POLARstar OPTIMA; BMG Labtechnologies, Germany). The OD values were used to calculate the mean photo effect (MPE) value using OECD provided software "3T3 NRU Phototox". (Version 2.0, Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Germany). The results for the control (CPZ and SDS) were used for the quality assurance of the assay.<br>
