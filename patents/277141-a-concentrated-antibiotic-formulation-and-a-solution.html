DESCRIPTION<br>
INJECTABLE FORMULATION OF ANTIBIOTIC AND SOLUTION FOR<br>
INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an injectable formulation for extemporaneous    preparation of a depsipeptide antibiotic, WAP-8294A, which has a marked antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a solution for intravenous administration thereof, and methods for preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
MRSA is drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus against which antibiotics including methicillin have been ineffective.    The emergence of MRSA was first reported in 1961 in England, and thereafter MRSA spread rapidly across the world.    Nowadays MRSA comprises 50-70 % of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in medical facilities, and is rampant in hospitals.    Health care providers and patients are easy to infect with MRSA by contact within medical facilities. Usually healthy persons become just carriers when infected with MRSA because MRSA itself is a variant of Staphylococcus aureus and has low pathogenic it}'. On the other hand, when aged persons with reduced immunity, patients with immunodeficiency, post-operative patients, or patients having an intubated catheter in the trachea or a blood vessel are infected with MRSA, it proliferates within the body to cause various infectious diseases such as pneumonia, enteritis, septicemia, endocarditis, and meningitis.    In the West and in Japan where medical care is highly developed, MRSA infections are regarded as one of the most serious infections in medical facilities, and require various countermeasures for prevention of its infections.<br>
Since there is no apparent difference in symptoms and progress between MRSA infections and other bacterial infections, MRSA infections are very difficult to distinsuish hv general clinical findings and laboratory test values.<br>
 <br>
The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of MRSA by microbiological examination.    For the treatment of MRSA infections, the administration of antibacterial agents is effective in combination with symptomatic treatment. However, it is necessary to use special antibacterial agents such as vancomycin<br>
5 and teicoplanin which are effective against MRSA because MRSA is resistant to common antibacterial agents.    When using these agents, the dosage and period for administration should be limited to the minimum in order to prevent the emergence of new resistant strains.    Currently the antibacterial agents which are used for MRSA infections require rather long period of time until they exhibit a<br>
 desired effect and therefore rapid recovery of the patients cannot be expected. In contrast to the above-described situation, a depsipeptide antibiotic named WAP-8294A2 has been developed as a promising antibacterial agent (Patent Document 1).      WAP-8294A2 has a relatively narrow antibacterial spectrum, and it has remarkably strong antimicrobial activity against MRSA and<br>
 can kill MRSA in a short period of time bactericidally.    Therefore, WAP-8294A2 is considered to be effective especially against    acute exacerbation of MRSA infections because of its strong antibacterial action, and it is expected to be a therapeutic agent which can contribute to rapid recovery of patients in critical condition due to MRSA infections.<br>
 Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 3339235<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM WHICH THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
As mentioned above, a depsipeptide antibiotic, WAP-8294A2 is anticipated as a therapeutic agent for MRSA infections which are serious problems in hospitals.    Although this agent has a strong antibacterial activity, it has the drawback that it is difficult to produce an injectable formulation and solution for intravenous administration thereof which is stable at high concentrations suitable for practical use, so it was impossible to be put to practical use.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation and a solution for administration of<br>
 <br>
WAP-8294A2 which are stable at high concentrations.    The ability to produce practical injectable formulation of this antibiotic would be very useful for the treatment of MRS A infections, for which there are limited chemotherapies. Means for Solving the Problem<br>
	WAP-8294A2 is a depsipeptide antibiotic having the structural formula (I)<br>
shown below.    It exerts strong antibacterial action on MRSA.    WAP-8294A2 is obtained as a hydrochloride, and a solution thereof is strongly acidic.    The stability of an aqueous solution of WAP-8294A2 depends on the pH and concentration.    It is stable in an acidic condition at a low pH-    However, at a<br>
0 neutral pH, it is viscous and tends to gel, and its stability decreases when its concentration becomes higher.    Also, when there are ions such as sodium ion in an aqueous solution, it tends to gel even at a low pH and tends to form precipitates at a neutral pH.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceutical strategies have been employed in order to obtain a practical injectable solution of WAP-8294A2 having the above-mentioned physical and chemical characteristics, but it has been difficult to produce a stable injectable solution containing WAP-8294A2 with a high concentration.    When prepared by a conventional method, an injectable solution of AVAP-8294A2 is an aqueous<br>
 <br>
solution with low concentration.    The solution is stable, but due to the increase in the required amount of the solution for administration, the burden on patients becomes heavy when the solution is injected.    Also, the solution is unstable as its pH changes.    Even, when the pH of the solution is adjusted just before administration, it must be used soon within 2-3 hours after pH adjustment due to instability.    In addition, the conventional method has the disadvantage that microprecipitates are liable to be formed in the solution near a neutral pH, and therefore the use of a filter is essential in order to prevent the precipitates from entering the blood vessels.    Furthermore, there may be a danger after intravenous administration that interaction with sodium ions and/or serum proteins in the blood produces molecular aggregation to cause hematological abnormalities.<br>
The present inventors investigated the stabilit&gt;' of a solution of WAP-8294A2. As explained below, they found that<br>
2-hydroxypropyl-13 -cyclodextrin solution and j3 -cyclodextrin solution are especially superior for stabilization of WAP-8294A2 among solubilizers for injectable use.    Further studies revealed that a stable WAP-8294A2 injectable solution with a high concentration can be obtained by using these solubilizers or stabilizers and without pH adjustment, unlike in conventional methods, to prepare an injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation.<br>
It was also found that when a solution for administration is obtained by dilution and pH adjustment using this formulation, the solution can be prepared at a high concentration and with a small volume and is more stable than a solution prepared by a conventional method.    Furthermore, the present injectable solution exhibits remarkable therapeutic effects against MRSA infection without causing hematological abnormalities after administration as shown in the below-described pharmacological experiments using animal models.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to an injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation, comprising an antibiotic. WAP-8294A2, of the following structural formula (1) as an active ingredient, characterized in that the formulation contains 2-hYdroxypropy]- /3 -cyclodextrin or β-cyclodextrin as a solubiiizer and the pH of the formulation is not adjusted.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
This injectable formulation is mixed with an infusion or diluent and with a   pH-adjusting agent when used.    The pH of the formulation preferably ranges between 2 and 4.    The concentration of the antibiotic, WAP-8294A2 in the formulation is preferably 5-20 mg/ml.    The concentration of 2-hydroxypropyl-β -cyclodextrin in the formulation is preferably 2-50%, and the concentration of β -cyclodextrin is preferably 0.5-2.5%.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for preparing an injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation, the formulation comprising an antibiotic WAP-8294A2 of the following structural formula (1) as an active ingredient, characterized in that 2-hydroxypropyl- β -cyclodextrin or β -cyclodextrin is used as a solubilizer and the pH is not adjusted in preparing the fonnulation.<br>
The present invention further relates to a solution for intravenous administration of an antibiotic, WAP-8294A2, comprising the above-mentioned injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation, mixed with an infusion or diluent and with a pH-adjusting agent.    A preferable pH-adjusting agent used in the solution for administration is a solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium hydroxide,    The infusion cr diluent is<br>
 <br>
preferably dextrose.<br>
The present invention additionally relates to a method for preparing a solution for intravenous administration of an antibiotic, WAP-8294A2, comprising mixing the above-mentioned injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation with an infusion or diluent and with a pH-adjusting agent.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The injectable formulation for extemporaneous preparation off the present invention exhibits the beneficial effects of being capable of containing high concentration of WAP-8294A2 and of being stable for a long period by using 2-hydroxypropyl- β -cyclodextrin or β -cyclodextrin as a solubilizer without adjusting the pH to overcome the disadvantages that an aqueous solution of WAP-8294A2 is liable to gelation and is not stable.<br>
Additionally, a solution for intravenous administration of the present invention obtained by mixing the above-mentioned injectable formulation with an infusion or diluent, and a pH-adjusting agent at the time of use is stable at a high concentration and exhibits remarkable antibacterial activity against MRSA without causing hematological abnormalities when administered.<br>
Furthermore, since the injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 of the present invention can contain high concentration of WAP-8294A2, the volume of a solution for intravenous administration can be small when administered to a patient, which makes it possible to reduce the burden on the patient. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The injectable formulation of the present invention is prepared by dissolving an antibiotic, WAP-8294A2 having the above structural formula (1) in a solution of 2-hydroxypropyl- β -cyclodextrin or β -cyclodextrin as a solubilizer or stabilizer without pH adjustment.<br>
An antibiotic WAP-8294A2 as an active ingredient has the structure represented by the above formula (1) and is isolated as a hydrochloridc-Method.s for- production thereof include., for example a method as described in the<br>
 <br>
specification of Japanese Patent No. 3339235.    This method comprises culturing an antibiotic WAP-8294A2-producing bacteria belonging to Lysobacter genus such as Lysobacter sp. strain WAP-8294A (PERM BP-4990), separating the antibiotic, WAP-8294A2 from the culture broth, and conducting further separation and purification to obtain the antibiotic, WAP-8294A2.<br>
Since WAP-8294A2 is isolated as a hydrochloride, it is dissolved in a solution of 2-hydroxypropyl- 0 -cyclodextrin or P -cyclodextrin without adjusting the pH resuhing in an injectable solution having a pH of 2 to 4.<br>
The following Table 1 shows that 2-hydroxypropyl- j3 -cyclodextrin or /3 -cyclodextrin as a solubilizer or stabilizer is superior in stabilizing WAP-8294 A2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
more preferably 5% to 20%.    The concentration of  -cyclodextrin which is used is preferably within the range of 0.5% to 2.5% and more preferably 1% to 2%.<br>
WAP-8294A2 can be dissolved in a concentration ranging from 5mg/mL to 20mg/mL in the injectable formulation of the present invention.    More preferably, it is contained in a concentration ranging from 5mg/mL to 15mg/mL. Thus, compared with a prior ail: method of using a solubihzer other than 2-hydroxypropyl- /3 -cyclodextrin and /3 -cyclodextrin and adjusting the pH with a pH-adjusting agent, an injectable formulation which contains high concentration of WAP-8294A2 and is stable can be obtained.<br>
The solution for intravenous administration of the present invention can be prepared by mixing the above-mentioned injectable foi-mulation with an infiision or diluent and adding a pH-adjusting agent.    This solution is preferably adjusted to a pH of 6-8.   The amount of an infusion or diluent added may be suitably determined based on the concentration of WAP-8294A2 in the injectable formulation, the volume suitable for administration, the dosage of WAP-8294A2, etc.   The solution for administration can be prepared in a relatively high concentration such as 7.5mg/mL, and is preferably prepared in a concentration of O.lmg/mL to 5mg/mL and more preferably O.lmg/mL to 3mg/mL.    The solution for administration obtained by a prior art method is liable to produce precipitation and is not stable even at a concentration of 0,lmg/mL.    Also, hematological disorders may be caused after administration.<br>
Any infusion or diluent which is conventionally used can be used, but it is preferably dextrose from the standpoint of stability.    As a pH-adjusting agent, a solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium hydroxide is preferably used.    The solution for administration of the present invention may also contain pharmaceutically conventional additives such aspresei-vatives.<br>
The solution for administration of the present invention can be administered as a drip infusion and is useful as an agent for treating bacterial infections, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.<br>
The dosage of the present preparation '/aries with the type of disease to be<br>
 <br>
treated, the route of administration, the frequency of administration, the condition of the patient, etc.    For example. 0.5-30mg/kg per day of WAP-8294A2 is preferably administered to an adult.<br>
In order to further illustrate the present invention, examples and pharmnacological experiments are given below, but these examples do not limit the present invention in any way. EXAMPLE 1<br>
Injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 prepared in 16% solution of 2-hydroxypropyl- Q -cyclodextrin<br>
1.0 g of raw material of WAP-8294A2 was dissolved in 200 ml of a 16% solution of 2-hydroxypropyl- B -cyclodextrin prepared using distilled water for injection to obtain an injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 without adjusting the pH.    The resulting formulation was stable at room temperature for 6 months. EXAMPLE 2<br>
Injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 prepared in 5% solution of 2-hydroxypropyl-β -cyclodextrin<br>
1.0 g of raw material of WAP-8294A2 was dissolved in 100 ml of a 5% solution of 2-hydroxypropyl-β -cyclodextrin prepared using distilled water for injection, to obtain an injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 without adjusting the pH.    The resulting formulation was stable at room temperature for 6 months. EXAMPLE 3<br>
Injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 prepared in 2% solution of β -cyclodextrin<br>
1.0 g of raw material of WAP-8294 A2 was dissolved in 100 ml of a 2% solution of β -cyclodextrin prepared using distilled water for injection to obtain an injectable formulation of WAP-8294A2 without adjusting the pH.    The resulting formulation was stable at room temperature for 6 months, EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of solution for intravenous administration of WAP-g294A2<br>
20 ml of the injectable formulation containing 5 mg/ml of WAP'8294A2 in a 16% solution of 2-hydroxypropyi- β -cyclodextrin- β-eparcd in Example 1 were<br>
 <br>
neutralized by adding 2 mi of a pH-adjusting agent, which was obtained by adding 0.1 N sodium hydroxide to a phosphate buffer consisting of 39 volumes of 100 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate and 61 volumes of 100 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate to afford funal concentration of sodium hydroxide of 0.02 N.    78 ml of a 5% dextrose solution for injection were added to this solution until the total volume became 100 ml.    The prepared solution for administration had a pH of 6.9 and an osmolality of 230 mOsm/kg.    The resulting solution was stable at    room temperature for 24 hours. [EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1] 4-day repeated dose toxicity study in mice<br>
Four days-repeated dose to mice was carried out and toxicity results were compared between the solution for intravenous administration of the present invention and the conventional solution in three different doses of 50 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day.    The injectable solution of WAP-8294A2 of the present invention was prepared by the method shown in Example 4 (with 2-hydroxypropyl-  -cyclodextrm), and the prior art solution was a solution of WAP-8294A2 prepared in a solution of 5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride. These dosages corresponded to 7.5 mg/mL, 1.5mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL, respectively, as WAP-8294A2.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 2, in the group administered 50 mg/kg/day (7.5 rag/mL as WAP-8294A2) of the prior art solution, all mice died while developing clonic convulsions right after administration on day 1.    In contrast, in the group administered 50 mg/kg/day of the present solution, there were no deaths or abnormality in clinical signs.    As to hematological disorders, in the group administered 10 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/mL) of the prior art solution, a tendency for a low values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and decreased platelet values were obsei-ved.    On the other hand, in the group administered 2 mg/kg/day (0.3 mg/mL) and 10 mg/kg/day (1.5 mg/mL) of the present solution, there were no abnormalities.    A clear difference was observed between the prior art solution and the present solution in mortality and hematological abnormalities. Thus, the present solution of WAP-8294A2 had remarkable improvement in<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2]<br>
in vivo Efficacy study in a MRSA infection model<br>
Efficacy was compared between the present solution of WAP-8294A2 prepared in the manner shown in Example 4 and vancomycin for injection (5% dextrose solution) using an MRSA infection model in mice.    One hour after intravenous inoculation of MRSA (strain ATCC 33591), each single-dose of test solution was administered    intravenously, and the mortality of mice was observed for a week.<br>
The 50% effective dose (mg/kg) was calculated from the survival rate at each dosage.    As shown in Table 3, the 50% effective dose of the present solution of WAP-8294A2 was 52-fold lower than vancomycin.    It was confirmed that the present solution for administration of WAP-8294A2 showed significant efficacy against MRSA-infected mice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
