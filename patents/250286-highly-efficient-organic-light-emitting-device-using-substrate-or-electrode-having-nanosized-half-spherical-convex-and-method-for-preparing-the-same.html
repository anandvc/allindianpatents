				<td>Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to an organic light-emitting device, particularly an<br>
organic light-emitting device having non-planar structure, and a method for preparing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a transparent substance having continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes, a highly efficient organic light-emitting device using the same, and a method for preparing the. same. Background Art<br>
[2]	Organic electroluminescence means converts electrical energy into light energy by<br>
using organic materials. Its principle is explained as follows. When voltage is applied between an anode and a cathode while aligning an organic material layer between the anode and the cathode, holes are injected into the organic material layer from the anode, and electrons are injected into the organic material layer from the cathode. When the injected holes couple with the injected electrons, excitons may be formed and such excitons fall to the ground state to generate light. Such generated light is emitted through an anode, a cathode or both electrodes. Generally, an organic Jight-emilting device may be classified as a top emission type, bottom emission type and bilateral emission type according to the emitting direction of light<br>
[3]	Recently, research has been actively carried out for preparing displays or il-<br>
lumination units by using such electroluminescent phenomenon. In addition, techniques for depositing organic material layers in the form of a single layer to multilayers are being actively studied in order to achieve effective organic light-emitting devices. Most currently available organic light-emitting devices include electrode layers and organic material layers deposited in the form of a planar structure. An organic light-emitting device having a planar multi-layer structure comprising electrode layers, and organic material multi-layers including a hole injection layer (103), a hole transport layer (104), a light-emitting layer (105), and an electron transport layer (106) as shown in Fig. 1, has been widely used.<br>
[4]	The light generated from a light-emitting layer of the organic light-emitting device<br>
in Fig. 1 may pass through two different paths. Namely, the light may be emitted out of the organic light-emitting device through a transparent anode layer and glass substrate<br>
or may remain in the organic light-emitting device by being reflected entirely from the glass substrate surface or the anode surface. At this time, the amount of the light emitted out of the organic light-emitting device is only about l/2n2 among the light generated from the light-emitting layer (wherein, n is the refractive index of an organic material layer). If the refractive index of the organic material layer is 1.7, less than 17% of the light generated from the device can be emitted out of the organic light-emitting device.<br>
[5]	To solve the above problem and emit a large amount of light out of the organic<br>
light-emitting device, an organic light-emitting device including a non-planar layer, i.e., non-planar structure, has been suggested. The organic light-emitting device having a non-planar structure can be prepared through the following two methods.<br>
[6]	According to a first method, a photonic crystal having a gravure pattern is formed<br>
on a glass substrate through a photolithography process before a transparent anode is deposited on the glass substrate (see U.S. 6,630,684 and Appl. Phys. Lett. 82,3779 issued in 2003 by Y. Lee et al.), or a corrugated pattern is formed on the glass substrate by using an interference of light (see WO 2000/70691 and Adv. Mater. 13,3,23 issued in 2001 by B. J. Matterson et al.), for improving light-emitting efficiency. In detail, the former deposits an anode layer on the glass substrate, after forming the photonic crystal on the glass substrate and flattening the surface thereon by using SiNx. The latter deposits an electrode layer and an organic material layer on the glass substrate while maintaining a corrugated pattern, after forming the corrugated pattern of transparent polymer on the glass substrate by using photoresist materials and an interference of light.<br>
[7]	According to a second method, after preparing an organic light-emitting device<br>
having a planar structure as shown in Fig. 1, a micro-sized lens structure (see WO 2003/007663 and J. Appl. Phys. 91, 3324 issued in 2002 by S. Moller et al.) or a millimeter-sized lens structure (see WO 2001/33598) is attached to a surface of a glass substrate of the organic light-emitting device, thereby improving the light-emitting efficiency of the device.<br>
[8]	The above two methods can improve the light-emitting efficiency of the light-<br>
emitting device. However, the above two methods cause problems when they are applied to an available product.<br>
[9]	The first method uses the photolithography process, so it may be impossible to eco-<br>
nomically form the photonic crystal structure or the corrugated structure over a large-sized area. That is, in order to prepare the light-emitting device using the photonic crystal structure, it is necessary to sequentially carry out a deposition process, a photolithography process, and an etching process. At tins time, the substrate must, be processed at least two times under a vacuum state. In addition, in order to prepare the<br>
light-emitting device using the corrugated structure, it is necessary to perform the photolithography process by using an interference of light However, the photolithography process is not adaptable for forming a uniform corrugated structure over a substrate having an area more than a few cm2.<br>
[10]	The second method has limitations when it is applied to a display because the lens<br>
structure has a size in the range of about a few micrometers to a few millimeters. In addition, the second method is not adaptable for a large-sized area due to preparation work thereof. According to the lens structure disclosed in WO 2003/007663, a minimum surface size of the lens structure is defined as a few D such that the minimum surface size of the lens structure must be larger than the maximum wavelength of visible ray emitted from the organic light-emitting device. In addition, according to the lens structure disclosed in WO 2001/33598, the size of the lens structure must be larger than the size of one unit of an organic light-emitting device. Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>

having continuous nano-sized half-spherical recesses formed by a porous aluminum oxide layer forming process was used as a mold, continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes can be economically formed on a large-sized transparent substance. In addition, the inventors have found that continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes can be formed on an organic light-emitting device by using the transparent substance prepared by such method, and thus the light generated in an organic material layer of the organic light-emitting device can be maximally emitted out of the device.<br>

[50]	Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram of an organic light-emitting device according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
[51]	Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail.<br>
[52]	The term "nano-size" generally means the range of 1-1,000 nm in nanometer unit<br>
However, in this specification, the term "nano-size" can be understood to mean 25-1,000 nm of the range of the diameter of the recesses or convexes that can be formed actually on an aluminum substrate or a transparent substance by the present invention.<br>
[53]	In addition, the term "a first main surface ofatransparent substance" in this spec-<br>
ification means a surface formed with convexes by using an aluminum substrate as a mold and opposite to a surface adhering device.<br>
[54]	A transparent substance formed with continuous nano-sized convexes on its first<br>
main surface according to the present invention has a new structure that can be prepared only by the method of the present invention as described be]ow. The transparent substance can be used as an application for rninimizing the condition of a total internal reflection in order to emit more light out of devices in a flat panel display technical field. For example, when the transparent substance according to the present invention is applied to an organic light-emitting device, its principle is provided below.<br>
[55]	In an organic light-emitting device comprising a substrate, a first electrode, an<br>
organic material layer(s) and a second electrode in sequentially laminated form, the transparent substance formed with continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on its first main surface according to the present invention can be disposed on the underside of the substrate that does not contact the first electrode and/or the upside of the second electrode that does not contact the organic material layer. Here, it should be noted that the half-spherical convexes according to the present invention are preferably disposed, not on the interior surface where the device is formed, but on the exterior of the device, i.e., the underside of the substrate and/or the upside of the second electrode. Since an organic light-emitting device must be formed with a very thin thickness, in contrast to other light-emitting devices such as an inorganic electroluminescent device, formation of a non-planar structure in the interior of the device can affect the operation of the device.<br>
[56]	As illustrated in Fig 4, in an organic light-emitting device having a surface of a<br>
planar structure, the light generated may remain within the organic light-emitting device by a total internal reflection. However, in an organic light-emitting device having continuous nano-sized convexes in its surface, the light may be emitted out of the device by multiple reflections, preferably one or two times on the transparent substance. As shown in the principle above, an organic light-emitting device haying a surface formed with continuous nano-sized convexes according to the present<br>
invention can emit more light out of the device.<br>
[57]	In addition, since half-spherical con vexes formed on the surface of an organic light-<br>
emitting device according to the present invention are nano-sized and have a similar size to a wavelength of light, they can provide far superior effects than a simple lens by an interaction with the light emitted from the organic material layer. Accordingly, nano-sized half-spherical convexes of the present invention are different from the micro-sized lens structure described in the prior art (WO 2003/7663). A further detailed explanation is provided below.<br>
[58]	In the present invention, since half-spherical convexes on the substrate or electrode<br>
of (he organic light-emitting device are nano-sized, the brightness of the organic light-emitting device can be further improved due to a wave character of light when light is emitted from the organic material layer of the device. For instance, when a diameter of the half-spherical convexes is identical to or shorter than a wavelength of a visible ray, the half-spherical convex structure may convert the route of light by a diffused reflection or a scattering phenomenon of light Therefore, the half-spherical convexes can cause more light to be emitted out of the organic light-emitting device by minimizing a total internal reflection condition more than the planar structure. Such effect may be increased when the diameter of the half-spherical convexes is set within a range between a half-wavelength and one wavelength of the visible ray.<br>
[59]	In addition, according to the present invention, the transparent substance having a<br>
plurality of continuous half-spherical convexes on its first main surface is characterized by being prepared through a porous aluminum oxide layer forming process. The porous aluminum oxide layer forming process is known in a technical field different from this invention's technical field. However, there are no cases of using the porous aluminum oxide layer forming process to prepare the transparent substance having nano-sized convexes. Inventors of the present invention have found that the transparent substance having nano-sized convexes with a large size can be prepared at a low cost through the porous aluminum oxide layer forming process, and thus, the transparent substance having a non-planar structure can be applied to a flat panel display device such as an organic light-emitting device with a large size at a low cost.<br>
[60]	In the present invention, in order to achieve the above effect of the present<br>
invention, half-spherical convexes disposed on the substrate or electrode in the organic light-emitting device of the present invention preferably have a diameter of a range between a half wavelength and one wavelength of the visible ray, i.e., 200-800 nm. In addition, the half-spherical convexes are preferably uniformly distributed. In the present invention, the surface formed with continuous nano-sized convexes is illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
[61 ]	The porous aluminum oxide layer forming process has been disclosed in a<br>
document entitled A.P. Li et al. J. Appl. Phys., 84,6023 (1998), etc. A simple explanation is provided below. An aluminum substrate having at least one aluminum surface is dipped in an appropriate acid solution, such as a sulfuric acid solution, a phosphoric acid solution, an oxalic acid solution or a chromic acid solution. Then, an appropriate oxidation voltage, for example 10 to 400 V is applied to the aluminum substrate so that an oxide layer, in which recesses having a diameter of about 25 to 1,000 nm, preferably 200 to 800 nm, and a depth of about a few hundreds of nm to few 0 are uniformly distributed, can be formed at the aluminum substrate. The depth of the recesses may increase proportionally to the processing time. At this time, at an interface between the oxide layer and the aluminum substrate, recesses having a curvature in identical direction to curvature of the half-spherical recesses on the oxide layer are formed.<br>
[62]	Fig. 5 shows a forming process for an aluminum oxide layer through the above<br>
method. In Fig. 5, steps a) to d) represent shape-variation of the oxide layer over time in the porous aluminum oxide layer forming process. At an initial stage, a thin and uniform oxide layer (501) is formed on an aluminum substrate (502) (see (a) in FIG. 5). After a period of time, as the volume of the oxide layer is expanded, a surface of the oxide layer is irregularly deformed (see, (b) in FIG. 5). Such an irregular surface of the oxide layer may cause an uneven current density. That is, the current density may increase at a recess section of the oxide layer and may decrease at a protrusion section of the oxide layer. Then, fine recesses are formed at the recess section having a high current density due to an operation of an electric field and an electrolyte of the acid solution. The diameter of the fine recesses does not further increase after a predetermined time lapses (see, (c) in Fig. 5). In addition, me depth of the recesses may rapidly increase in a vertical direction with respect to the surface formed with the recesses while constantly maintaining the number of the recesses (see (d) in Fig. 5). As the depth of the recesses increases, recesses having a curvature in identical direction to the curvature of the recesses on the aluminum oxide layer are formed at an interface of the aluminum oxide layer (501) and the aluminum subsnrate (502) (see (c) and (d) in Fig. 5).<br>
[63]	After forming a porous oxide layer on the aluminum substrate by the process<br>
explained above, a substrate formed with a plurality of continuous half-spherical recesses as (e) in Fig. 5 can be prepared by removing the porous oxide layer from the aluminum substrate. The oxide layer can be removed through a chemical etching process, an electrochemical etching process or an electrical shock process, etc. However, the present invention does not limit the process for removing the oxide layer.<br>
[64]	According to the chemical etching process, the oxide layer is etched by using an<br>
acid solution. The example of the acid solution includes a mixture of a phosphoric acid<br>
solution and a chromic acid solution. According to the electrochemical etching process, a substrate formed with the oxide layer is used as an electrode and the substrate is dipped in the acid solution so that the oxide layer is removed from the substrate through an electrochemical reaction. The example of (he acid solution includes a mixture of ethanol and HClO4. According to the electrical shock process, electric shock is applied to the substrate by electrochemically adjusting the voltage, thereby removing the oxide layer from the aluminum substrate.<br>
[65]	In the process, if the aluminum substrate includes at least one aluminum surface, the<br>
remaining material of the aluminum substrate is not limited to specific materials. For instance, a substrate consisting of aluminum can be used in the present invention, and a substrate consisting of an aluminum layer laminated on another substrate such as a glass substrate also can be used.<br>
[66]	Then, nano-sized half-spherical convexes, which are inverted structures of nano-<br>
sized half-spherical recesses, can be formed on the transparent substance by using the aluminum substrate formed with continuous nano-sized half-spherical recesses as a mold. For this purpose, the methods known for this technical field may be used and the present invention is not limited to specific methods.<br>
[67]	The material for the transparent substance preferably includes something able to be<br>
used as a replica molding material that can remain and flatten the shape of nano-sized half-spherical recesses in the aluminum substrate. Most polymers can be used as the material for the transparent substance. However, the transparent substance having nano-sized half-spherical convexes for being applied to an organic light-emitting device of the present invention needs to have good transmission at the visible range of light Therefore, the material for the transparent substance more preferably is a polymer that has no less than 60% of transmittance for a visible ray after being fonned nano-sized half-spherical convexes thereon. The material satisfying said condition includes PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane) [see, T.M. Odom et al. Langmuir, 18,5314 (2002)] or PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) [see, H. Tan et al. J. vac. Sci. Technol. B, 16,3926 (1998)], but is not limited to them.<br>
[68]	One method for forming continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on the<br>
transparent substance consisting of such material may be a nano-imprint technique.<br>
[69]	A nano-imprint technique is a method that uses a substrate having a nano-sized<br>
structure as a mold for preparing a film having an inverted mold structure. That is, a film is fonned on a substrate having a nano-sized structure by using a material that can remain and flatten the structure of the substrate, such as PDMS or PMMA. Such film can be formed by a method such as pouring or spin-coaling such material in molten state on the mold substrate, etc. If bubbles are generated on the film, the bubbles can be removed by curing the film under a vacuum. Then, a film having an inverted<br>
structure of a nano-sized structure on the mold can be prepared by curing the film through heat or ultraviolet and then taking off the substrate used as the mold.<br>
[70]	In the method, it is preferable that the bonding between the mold and transparent<br>
film having an inverted structure of the mold's structure is weakened, for transferring the nanometer-sized structure. In this regard, the mold substrate may be dipped in a solution comprising a material able to reduce a surface energy of the mold substrate, or formed with a release layer thereon by exposing the mold substrate to the vapor of a material able to reduce a surface energy of the mold substrate, and then washing the mold substrate. The material able to reduce the surface energy of the mold substrate includes tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydroocty]trichlorosilane, etc. However, the present invention is not limited to such methods and may use methods known in the art in order to achieve the same effect as the one achieved by the release layer.<br>
[71]	In the nano-imprint technique, said aluminum substrate having continuous nano-<br>
sized half-spherical recesses can be used as the mold substrate, but a polymer mold having continuous nano-sized half-spherical recesses prepared by repeating the nano-imprint technique more than 2 times by using the aluminum substrate as a mold also can be used. At this time, the material for the polymer mold includes hard polymer materials, for example, polyurethane, etc. In order to complement the hardness of the polymer mold and facilitate separation between the polymer mold and the transparent substance in the preparation of the transparent substance having continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes, a scratch resistant thin layer consisting of polystyrene or polycarbonate, etc. or metal thin layer may be formed on the polymer mold. The aluminum or polymer mold can be used more than 10 times through a simple washing.<br>
[72]	Another method for forming continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on the<br>
transparent substance may be a method that forms continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes by appropriately pressing the transparent substance by the aluminum mold having continuous nano-sized half-spherical recesses while curing the transparent substance by ultraviolet or heat. In such method, the continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes can be formed on the transparent substance by adhering the mold to a roller or forming continuous nano-sized half-spherical recesses on a roller, and then performing a roll process by such roller [see, H. Tan et al. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B, 16, 3926 (1998)].<br>
[73]	In the present invention, the transparent substance prepared as described above can<br>
be applied to devices that need to minimize the condition of a total internal reflection. Recently, such relief of a total internal reflection is required in a flat panel display device field, but the application of the transparent substance of this invention is not limited to it. In one embodiment of the present invention, the transparent substance according to the present invention can be applied to an organic light-emitting device.<br>
[74]	An organic light-emitting device having continuous nano-sized half-spherical<br>
convexes can be prepared by adhering the transparent substance of the present invention to a transparent substrate and/or a transparent electrode, and forming continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on the transparent substance by the method as described above before or after adhering the transparent substance to the substrate or the electrode. The process that adheres the transparent substance to the transparent substrate or transparent electrode and the process that forms continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on the transparent substance may be performed before or after preparing the organic light-emitting device.<br>
[75]	In the present invention, the method adhering the transparent substance to the<br>
substrate or electrode is not limited to a specific method, and the present invention may use methods known in the art.<br>
[76]	One example of the method adhering the transparent substance to the substrate or<br>
electrode of the device is a method comprising the steps of activating the surface of the substrate or electrode by oxygen plasma, etc., and then adhering the transparent substance to the substrate or electrode by heat or ultraviolet so as to remove an air layer between the transparent substance and the substrate or electrode.<br>
[77]	Another example of the method adhering the transparent substance to the substrate<br>
or electrode of the device is a method that forms a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the substrate or electrode to improve adhesion between the transparent substance and the substrate or electrode. As an example, in order to improve adhesion between a glass substrate and a PDMS substance, the SAM can be formed on the glass substrate by dissolving 5-hexenyltrichlorosilane in a solvent such as toluene, and then dipping the glass substrate in the solution.<br>
[78]	Another method adhering the transparent substance to the substrate or electrode is a<br>
method that forms a polymer film by a method comprising the step of pouring or spin-coating the material of the transparent substance in the molten state on the substrate or electrode.<br>
[79]	In the present invention, when the transparent substance is adhered to a transparent<br>
substrate, a material having mechanical and thermal stability and low permeability for water and oxygen preferably may be used as a material for the transparent substrate. Preferable examples of the material include glass, quartz, polymers, and materials having a laminated structure of metal oxides having a good barrier property for water and oxygen. However, the present invention is not limited to them.<br>
[80]	The organic light-emitting device of the present invention can be prepared by<br>
methods known in the art and can have a structure known in the art, except for having continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes on the surface of the substrate and/or electrode of the device by the method as described above.<br>
[813	According to one embodiment of the present invention, the organic light-emitting<br>
device may have a structure as shown in Fig. 2. The organic light-emitting device shown in Fig. 2, can be prepared by depositing an anode (202) on the transparent substrate (201) adhering the transparent substance (208) having continuous nano-sized half-spherical convexes, using a metal, a metal oxide having conductivity, or an alloy thereof, then forming organic material layers comprising a hole injection layer (203), a hole transport layer (204), a light-emitting layer (205) and a electron transport layer (206), etc. thereon, and then depositing a material used for a cathode (207) thereon, by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) such as an E-beam evaporation or a sputtering, etc.<br>
[82]	In addition to such method, an organic light-emitting device can be prepared by se-<br>
quentially depositing a cathode materia], an organic material layer, and an anode material on the substrate (see, WO 2003/012890). The organic material layer may have the form of a single layer structure or a multi-layer structure comprising a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer and an electron transport, layer, etc. The organic material layer may be formed in a smaller number of layers through a solvent process, such as a spin coating process, a screen-printing process or an ink jet process using various polymer materials, instead of a physical vapor deposition process.<br>
[83]	The anode preferably may be prepared by using a material having a high work<br>

In order to emit the light through the cathode in the organic light-emitting device, a material having a high transparent degree (&gt;50%) preferably may be used as the material for the cathode. Particularly, a material prepared by depositing a transparent conductive material such as indium tin oxide or indium zinc oxide on a transparent thin layer consisting of Al or a mixture of Mg and Ag is more preferred.<br>
[85]	The hob injection layer is prepared by using a material capable of allowing holes to<br>
