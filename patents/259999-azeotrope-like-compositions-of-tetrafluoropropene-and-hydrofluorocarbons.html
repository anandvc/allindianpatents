				<td>AZEOTROPE-LIKE COMPOSITIONS OF TETRAFLUOROPROPENE AND HYDROFLUOROCARBONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to compositions comprising 1,1,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. More specifically, the present invention provides azeotrope-like compositions comprising 1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene and uses thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Fluorocarbon based fluids have found widespread use in industry in a number of applications, including as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, blowing agents, heat transfer media, and gaseous dielectrics. Because of the suspected environmental problems associated with the use of some of these fluids, including the relatively high global warming potentials associated therewith, it is desirable to use fluids having low or even zero ozone depletion potential, such as hydrofluorocarbons ("HFCs"). Thus, the use of fluids that do not contain chlorofJuorocarbons ("CFCs") or hydrochlorofluorocarbons ("HCFCs") is desirable. Furthermore, some HFC fluids may have relatively high global warming potentials associated therewith, and il is desirable to use hydrofluorocarbon or other fluorinated fluids having global warming potentials as low as possible while maintaining the desired performance in use properties. Additionally, the use of single component fluids or azeotrope-like mixtures, which do not substantially fractionate on boiling and evaporation, is desirable. However, the identification of new, environmentally-safe, non-fractionating mixtures is complicated due to the fact that azeotrope formation is not readily predictable.<br>
The industry is continually seeking new fluorocarbon based mixtures that offer alternatives, and are considered environmentally safer substitutes for CFCs and HCFCs. Of particular interest are mixtures containing both hydrofluorocarbons and other fluorinated compounds, both<br><br>
of low ozone depletion potentials. Such mixtures and their uses are the subject of this invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present inventors have developed several compositions that help to satisfy the continuing need for alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs. According to certain embodiments, the present invention provides azeotrope-like compositions comprising, or consisting essentially of, 1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene ("HFO-1234ze"), preferably trans-1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene ("transHFO-1234ze") and at least one compound component selected from the group consisting of 1,1-difluoroethane ("HFC-152a"), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane ("HFC-227ea"), 1,1,1,2,-tetraafluoethane ("HFC-134a"), 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane ("HFC-125") and combinations of two or more of these. Thus, the present invention overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings by providing azeotrope-like compositions that are, in preferred embodiments, substantially free of CFCs arid HCFCs and which exhibit relatively constant boiling point and vapor pressure characteristics.<br>
The preferred compositions of the invention tend to exhibit characteristics which make them particularly desirable for use in a number of applications, including as refrigerants in automotive air conditioning and heat pump systems, and in stationary air conditioning and refrigeration. In particular, applicants have recognized that the present compositions tend to exhibit relatively low global warming potentials ("GWPs"), preferably less than about 1000, more preferably less than about 500, and even more preferably less than about 150. Preferred embodiments of the present compositions tend also to have similar or higher refrigeration capacity than many conventional HFC refrigerants, for example, HFC-134a. Accordingly, applicants have recognized that such compositions can be used to great advantage in a number of applications, including as replacements for CFCs such as dichlorodifluormethane (CFC-12), HCFCs,<br><br>
such as chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), and HFCs, such as tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and combinations of HFCs and CFCs, such as the combination of CFC-12 and 1,1-difluorethane (HFC-152a) (the combination CFC-12:HFC-152a in a 73.8:26.2 mass ratio being known as R-500) in refrigerant, aerosol, and other applications.<br>
Additionally, applicants have recognized surprisingly that the azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention exist and can be readily formed in view of the teachings contained herein.   Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides methods of producing azeotrope-like compositions comprising the step of combining HFO-1234, preferably HFO-1234ze, and even more preferably transHFO-1234ze, and a compound selected from the group consisting of 1,1-difluoroethane ("HFC-152a"), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane ("HFC-227ea"), 1,1,1,2r tetraafluoethane ("HFC-134a"), 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane ("HFC-125") and combinations of two or more of these, in amounts effective to produce an azeotrope-iike composition.<br>
The term "HFO-1234" is used herein to refer to all<br>
tetrafluoropropenes. Among the tetrafluoropropenes are included HFO-<br>
H-234yf and both-eis-and^rans-lT-SrST^-tetrafluGropF&amp;penelHFO-<br>
1234ze). The term HFO-1234ze is used herein generically to refer to 1, 3,<br>
3, 3-tetrafluoropropene, independent of whether it is the cis- or trans- form.<br>
The terms "cisHFO-1234ze" and "transHFO-1234ze" are used herein to<br>
describe the els- and trans- forms of 1, 3, 3, 3-tetrafluoropropene<br>
respectively. The term "HFO-1234ze" therefore includes within its scope<br>
cisHFO-1234ze, transHFO-1234ze, and all combinations and mixtures of<br>
-these.	- -	—<br>
Although the properties of cisHFO-1234ze and transHFCM234ze differ in at least some respects, and while the present azeotrope-like compositions are based mainly on transHFO-1234ze, it is contemplated that the cisHFO1234ze form may be present in certain embodiments in amounts which do not negate the essential nature of the azeotrope-like<br><br>
composition. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the terms "HFO-1234ze" and 1, 3, 3, 3-tetrafluoropropene refer to both stereo isomers, and the use of this term is intended to indicate that each of the cis-and transforms applies and/or is useful for the stated purpose unless otherwise indicated.<br>
HFO-1234 compounds are known materials and are listed in Chemical Abstracts databases. The production of fluoropropenes such as CF3CH=CH2 by catalytic vapor phase fluorination of various saturated and unsaturated halogen-containing C3 compounds is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,889,379; 4,798,818 and 4,465,786, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. EP 974,571, also incorporated herein by reference, discloses the preparation of 1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene by contacting 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) in the vapor phase with a chromium-based catalyst at elevated temperature, or in the liquid phase with an alcoholic solution of KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)2 or Mg(OH)2. In addition, methods for producing compounds in accordance with the present invention are described generally in connection with pending United States Patent Application entitled "Process for Producing Fluoroprepeftes" bearing-attorney docket number (H0003789 (26267)), which is also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
—ln""additro"rn"applicants h'ave recognizeTi that the azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention exhibit properties that make them advantageous for use as, or in, numerous applications, including as heat "transfer compositions (including as refrigerants in automotive air conditioning and heat pump systems, and in stationary air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems), blowing agents, propedants and sterilizing agents. Accordingly, yet other aspects of the present invention provide one or more azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention and methods associated with these and other uses.<br>
In another embodiment, the compositions of this invention may be used as propellants in sprayable compositions, either alone or in<br><br>
combination with known propellants. The propellant compositions comprise, more preferably consists essentially of, and, even more preferably consist of the compositions of the invention. The active ingredient to be sprayed together with inert ingredients, solvents, and other materials may also be present in the sprayable mixture. Preferably, the sprayable composition is an aerosol. Suitable active materials to be sprayed include, without limitation, cosmetic materials such as deodorants, perfumes, hair sprays, cleaning solvents, lubricants, as well as medicinal materials such as anti-asthma medications.<br>
The present compositions find particular advantage in methods and systems involving aerosol compositions, particularly in medicinal compositions, cleaning composition, and other sprayable compositions. Those of skill in the art will be readily able to adapt the present compositions for use in such applications without undue experimentation.<br>
Azeotrope-like Compositions<br>
As used herein, the term "azeotrope-like" is intended in its broad sense to include both compositions that are strictly azeotropic and compositions-that behave like azeotropiemixtures.-From fundamental principles, the thermodynamic state of a fluid is defined by pressure, temperature, liquid composition, and vapor composition. An azeotropic mixture is a system of two or more components in which the liquid composition and vapor composition are equal at the stated pressure and temperature. In practice, this means that the components of an azeotropic mixture are constant-boiling and cannot be separated during a phase change.<br>
Azeotrope-like compositions are constant boiling or essentially constant boiling. In other words, for azeotrope-like compositions, the composition of the vapor formed during boiling or evaporation is identical, or substantially identical, to the original liquid composition. Thus, with boiling or evaporation, the liquid composition changes, if at all, only to a<br><br>
minimal or negligible extent. This is to be contrasted with non-azeotrope-like compositions in whfch', during boiling or evaporation, the liquid composition changes to a substantial degree. All azeotrope-like compositions of the invention within the indicated ranges as well as certain compositions outside these ranges are azeotrope-like.<br>
The azeotrope-!ike compositions of the invention may include additional components that do not form new azeotrope-iike systems, or additional components that are not in the first distillation cut. The first distillation cut is the first cut-taken after the distillation column displays steady state operation under total reflux conditions. One way to determine whether the addition of a component forms a new azeotrope-like system so as to be outside of this invention is to distill a sample of the composition with the component under conditions that would be expected to separate a non-azeotropic mixture into its separate components. If the mixture -containing the additional component is non-azeotrope-like, the additional component will fractiooate from the azeotrope-like components. If the mixture is azeotrope-like, some finite amount of a first distillation cut will be obtained that contains all of the mixture components that is constant feeiling-orbehaves-as-a single substance. -    - -  —   —  ---—<br>
It follows from this that another characteristic of azeotrope-like compasitrarrsns that there is a range of compositions containing the same components in varying proportions that are azeotrope-fike or constant boifing. All such compositions are intended to be covered by the terms "azeotrope-like" and "constant boiling". As an example, it is well known that at differing pressures, the composition of a given azeotrope will vary -at least slightly, as does the boiling point of the composition. Thus, an azeotrope of A and B represents a unique type of relationship, but with a variable composition depending on temperature and/or pressure. It follows that, for azeotrope-like compositions, there is a range of compositions containing the same components in varying proportions that<br><br>
are azeotrope-like. All such compositions are intended to be covered by the term azeotrope-like as used herein.<br>
It is well-recognized in the art that it is not possible to predict the formation of azeotropes. (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,648,017 (column 3, lines 64-65) and U.S. Patent No. 5,182,040 (column 3, lines 62-63), both of which are incorporated herein by reference). Applicants have discovered unexpectedly that HFO-1234 and MFCs, particularly the HFCs described above, form azeotrope-like compositions.<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments, the azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention comprise, and preferably consist essentially of, effective amounts of HFO-1234 and the above-noted HFCs. The term "effective amounts" as used herein refers to the amount of each component which upon combination with the other component, results in the formation of an azeotrope-like composition of the present invention.<br>
The azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention can be produced by combining effective amounts of HFO-1234 and a component, preferably in fluid form, selected from the group consisting of 1,1-difluoroethane ("HFC-152a"), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane ("HFC-227ea"),1,1,4,2,-tetrafluroethane ("HFC-4343"), 1-1,1,2*2-pentafluoroethane ("HFC-125") and combinations of two or more of these. -Any-of a wide-variety-of methods known in the-art for combining two or more components to form a composition can be adapted for use in the present methods to produce an azeotrope-iike composition. For example, "transHFO-1234ze and HFC-152a can be mixed, blended, or otherwise combined by hand and/or by machine, as part of a batch or continuous reaction and/or process, or via combinations of two or more such steps. In light of the disclosure herein, those of skill in the art will be readily able to prepare azeotrope-like compositions according to the present invention without undue experimentation.<br>
Preferably, such azeotrope-like compositions comprise, preferably consist essentially of, from greater than zero to about 99 wt.% of of HFO-<br><br>
1234, preferably transHFO-1234ze, and from about 1 wt.% to less than 100 wt.% of one or more components selected from the group consisting 1,1-difIuoroethane('HFC-152a"), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane ("HFC-227ea"), 1,1,1,2,-tetrafluroethane ("HFC-134a"), and 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane ("HFC-125"). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the production transHFO-1234ze will commonly result in product which includes a small proportion of compound which are not transHFO-1234ze. For example, it would be common in expected for a product designated as transHFO-1234ze to include a minor percentage, for example about 0.5 wt. % up to about 1 wt.% of other components, including particularly cisHFO-1234ze and/or HFO-1234yf. The term "consisting essentially of transHFO-1234ze" used herein is intended to generally include such compositions.<br>
More preferably, the present azeotrope-like compositions comprise, and preferably consist essentially of, from about 5 wt.% to about 90 wt.% of HFO-1234, preferably tfansHFO-1234ze, and from about 10 wt.% to about 90 wt. % of one or more components selected from the group consisting of 1,1-difluoroethane ("HFC-152a"), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-tieptafluoropropane- (-HFG-227ea"), 1,1,1,2,-tetrafluroethane ("HFC-134a"), and 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoroethane ("HFC-125").

Unless otherwise indicated, all weight percents reported herein are based on the total weight of the HFO-1234 and the one or more components selected from the indicated group in the azeotrope-Jike composition.<br>

Preferably the HFO-1234 of these embodiments is transHFO-<br>
Composition Additives<br>
The azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention may further include any of a variety of optional additives including lubricants, stabilizers, metal passivators, corrosion inhibitors, flammability suppressants, and the like.<br>
According to certain embodiments, the azeotrope-like compositions of the present invention further comprise a stabilizer. Any of a variety of compounds suitable for stabilizing an azeotrope-like composition of the present invention may be used. Examples of certain preferred stabilizers include stabilizer compositions comprising stabilizing diene-based<br><br>
compounds, and/or phenol compounds, and/or epoxides selected from the group consisting of aromatic epoxides, alkyl epoxides, alkenyf epoxides, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention further comprise a lubricant. Any of a variety of conventional and unconventional lubricants may be used in the compositions of the present invention. An important requirement for the lubricant is that, when in use in a refrigerant system, there must be sufficient lubricant returning -to 4he compressor of the system such that the compressor is lubricated. Thus, suitability of a lubricant for any given system is determined partly by the refrigerant/lubricant characteristics and partly by the characteristics of the system in which it is intended to be used. Examples of suitable lubricants include, which are generally those commonly used in refrigeration machinery using or designed to use hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, ehloroflurocarbon refrigerants and hydrochlorofluorocarbons refrigerants, include mineral oil, silicone oil, polyalkyl benzenes (sometimes referred to as (PABs), polyo! esters (sometimes referred to as (POEs), potyalkylene glycols (sometimes referred to as (PAGs), polyaikylene-glycoF esters (sometimes-referred to-as-PAG esters), polyviny! ethers (sometimes referred to as PVEs), poly(alpha-olefin) (sometimes referred to as PAOs) and haJocarbon oils, particularly poly(chlorotrifluorethylene) and the like. Mineral oil, which comprises paraffin oil or naphthenic oil, is commercially available. Commercially available mineral oils include Witco LP 250 (registered trademark) from Witco, Zerol 300 (registered trademark) from Shrieve Chemical, Sunisco 3GS from Witco, and Galumet-R015 frorn-Calumet,- Commercially available polyalkyl benzene lubricants include Zerol 150 (registered trademark). Commercially available esters include neopentyl glycol dipelargonate which is available as Emery 2917 (registered trademark) and Hatcol 2370 (registered trademark). Commercially available PAGs include Motorcraft PAG Refrigerant Compressor Oil, available from Ford,<br><br>
with similar products being available from Dow. Commercialiy available PAOs include CP-4600 from CPI Engineering. Commercially available PVEs are available from Idemitsu Kosan. Commercialiy available PAG esters are available from Chrysler. Other useful esters include phosphate esters, dibasic acid esters, and fluoroesters.<br>
For refrigeration systems using or designed to use MFCs, it is generally preferred to use as lubricants PAGs, PAG esters, PVEs, and POEs, particularly for systems comprising compression refrigeration, air-conditioning (especially for automotive air conditioning) and heat pumps. For refrigeration systems using or designed to use CFCs or HCFCs, it is generally preferred to use as lubricants mineral oil or PAB. In certain preferred embodiments, the lubricants of this invention are organic compounds which are comprised of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with a ratio of oxygen to carbon and are included to provide, in combination with the amounts used, effective solubility and/or miscibility with the refrigerant to ensure sufficient return of the lubricant to the compressor. This solubility ~6r miscibility preferably exists at at least one temperature from about -30°C and 70°C.<br>
„=„=   H^AGs and PAG esters are highly- preferred in certain embodiments because they are currently in use in particular applications such as original equipment mobile air-conditioning systems. Polyol esters are highly preferred in other certain embodiments because they are currently in use in particular non-mobile applications such as residential, commercial, and industrial air conditioning and refrigeration. Of course, different mixtures of different types of lubricants may be used.<br>
Uses of the Compositions<br>
The present compositions have utility in a wide range of applications.   For example, one embodiment of the present invention relates to heat transfer compositions, such as refrigerant compositions, comprising an azeotrope-like composition of the present invention. The<br><br>
heat transfer compositions of the present invention are generally adaptable for use in heat transfer applications, that is, as a heating and/or cooling medium. Although it is contemplated that the compositions of the present invention may include the present azeotrope-like composition in combination with one or more other compounds or combinations of compounds in widely ranging amounts, it is generally preferred that heat transfer compositions of the present invention, including refrigerant compositions, consist essentially of, and in some embodiments consist of<br>
the present azeotrope-like-compositions.	-••-_-	<br>
The heat transfer compositions of the present invention may be used in any of a wide variety of refrigeration systems including air-conditioning (including both stationary and mobile air conditioning systems), refrigeration, heat-pump systems, and the like. In certain preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are -used in refrigeration systems originally designed for use with an HFC-refrigerant, such as, for example, HFC-134a or an HCFC refrigerant, such as, for example, HCFC-22. The preferred compositions of the present invention tend to exhibit many of the desirable characteristics of HFC-134a -and-other-HFG-refrigerantsr including non-flammabilityr-and-a GWP that is as low, or lower than that of conventional HFC-refrigerants and a capacity thatis~as substantially similar to or substantially matches, and preferably is as high as or higher than such refrigerants. In particular, applicants have recognized that the present compositions tend to exhibit relatively low global warming potentials ("GWPs"), preferably less than about 1000, more preferably less than about 500, and even more preferably less than about 150, In addition, the relatively constant boiling nature of the compositions of the present invention makes them even more desirable than certain conventional HFCs, such as R-404A or combinations of HFC-32, HFC-125 and HFC-134a (the combination HFC-32:HFC-125:HFC134a in approximate 23:25:52 weight ratio is referred to as R-407C), for use as refrigerants in many applications. Heat transfer compositions of the<br><br>
present invention are particularly preferred as replacements for HFC-134, HFC-152a, HFC-22, R-12 and R-500. The present compositions are also believed to be suitable as replacements for the above noted compositions in other applications, such as aerosols, blowing agents and the like.<br>
In certain other preferred embodiments, the present compositions are used in heat transfer systems in general, and in refrigeration systems in particular, originally designed for use with a CFC-refrigerant.   Preferred refrigeration compositions of the present invention may be used in refrigeration^systems containing a lubricant used conventionally with CFC-refrigerants, such as mineral oltsrpolyalkylbenzene, polyalkylene glycols, and the like, or may be used with other lubricants traditionally used with HFC refrigerants.<br>
As used herein the term "refrigeration system" refers generally to any system or apparatus, or any part or portion of such a system or -apparatus^ whieh-employs a refrigerant to provide cooling .    Such refrigeration systems include, for example, air conditioners, electric refrigerators, chillers (including chillers using centrifugal compressors), transport refrigeration systems, commercial refrigeration systems and the<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention may-be-usecho retrofit refrigeration systems-containing HFC, HCFC, and/or CFC-refrigerants and lubricants used conventionally therewith. Preferably, the present methods involve recharging a refrigerant system that contains a refrigerant to be replaced and a lubricant comprising the steps of (a) removing the refrigerant to be replaced from the refrigeration system while retaining a substantial portion of the lubricant in said system; and (b) introducing to the system a composition of the present invention. As used herein, the term "substantial portion" refers generally to a quantity of lubricant which is at least about 50% (by weight) of the quantity of lubricant contained in the refrigeration system prior to removal of the chlorine-containing refrigerant. Preferably, the substantial portion of<br><br>
lubricant in the system according to the present invention is a quantity of at least about 60% of the lubricant contained originally in the refrigeration system, and more preferably a quantity of at least about 70%. As used herein the term "refrigeration system" refers generally to any system or apparatus, or any part or portion of such a system or apparatus, which employs a refrigerant to provide cooling.    Such refrigeration systems include, for example, air conditioners, electric refrigerators, chillers, transport refrigeration systems, commercial refrigeration systems and the<br>
like.	     	<br>
Many existing refrigeration systems are currently adapted for use in connection with existing refrigerants, and the compositions of the present invention are believed to be adaptable for use in many of such systems, either with or without system modification. In many applications the compositions of the present invention may provide an advantage as a replacement in-smaller-systems currently based on certain refrigerants, for example those requiring a small refrigerating capacity and thereby dictating a need for relatively small compressor displacement. Furthermore, in embodiments where it is desired to use a lower capacity -refrigerant composition of the present invention, for reasons of-efficiency for example, to replace a refrigerant of higher capacity, such embodiments -otthe present-compositions provide a potential advantage. Thus, it is preferred in certain embodiments to use compositions of the present invention, particularly compositions comprising a substantial proportion of, and in some embodiments consisting essentially of the present azeotrope-like compositions, as a replacement for existing refrigerants, such as: .-HFC-134a;.CFC--12; HCFO22; HFC-152a; combinations of pentfluoroethane (HFC-125), trifluorethane (HFC-143a) and tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) (the combination HFC-125:HFC-143a:HFC134a in approximate 44:52:4 weight ratio is referred to as R-404A); combinations of HFC-32, HFC-125 and HFC-134a (the combination HFC-32:HFC-125:HFC134a in approximate 23:25:52 weight<br><br>
ratio is referred to as R-407C); combinations of methylene fluoride (HFC-32) and pentfluoroethane (HFC-125) (the combination HFC-32:HFC-125 in approximate 50:50 weight ratio is referred to as R-410A); the combination of CFC-12 and 1,1-difiuorethane (HFC-152a) (the combination CFC-12:HFC-152a in a 73.8:26.2 weight ratio is referred to R-500); and combinations of HFC-125 and HFC-143a (the combination HFC-125:HFC143a in approximate 50:50 weight ratio is referred to as R-507A). In certain embodiments it may also be beneficial to use the present compositions Jn connection with the replacement of referigerants formed from the combination HFC-32:HFC-125:HFC134a in approximate 20:40:40 weight ratio, which is referred to as R-407A, or in approximate 15:15:70 weight ratio, which is referred to as R-407D.. Heat transfer compositions of the present invention are particularly preferred as replacements for R-22, R-32, R-404A, R-407A, R-407C, R-407D, R-41OA and R-507A.   The present compositions are also believed to be suitable as replacements for the above noted compositions in other applications, such as aerosols, blowing agents and the like.<br>
In certain applications, the refrigerants of the present invention potentially permit the beneficial use of larger displacement compressors, thereby resulting in better energy efficiency than other refrigerants, such as-HFG-134a.—Therefore the refrigerant compositions of the present invention provide the possibility of achieving a competitive advantage on an energy basis for refrigerant replacement applications. —It is contemplated that the compositions of the present also have advantage (either in original systems or when used as a replacement for refrigerants such as CFC-_12, HCFC-22, HFC-134a, HFC-152a R-404A, R-41 OA , R-407C, R-500 and R-507A), in chillers typically used in connection with commercial air conditioning and refrigeration systems. In certain of such embodiments it is preferred to including in the present compositions from about 0.5 to about 30%, and in certain cases more preferably 0.5% to about 15% by weight of a supplemental flammabitity suppressant. In this<br><br>
regard it is noted that the HFO-1234ze component and the other compound in the azeotrope-Jike compositon of the present compositions may in certain embodiments act as a flammability suppressant with respect to other components in the composition. For example, in cases where other components more flammable than HFO~1234ze are included in the composition, HFO1234-ze may function to suppress the flammability of such other component. Thus, any additional components which have flammability suppressant functionality in the composition will sometimes be referred to herein as a supplemental flammability suppressant.<br>
In certain embodiments, co-refrigerants, including for example HFCs, HCFCs and CFCs may be included in the heat transfer compositions of the present invention, including one or more of the following compounds, including any and ail fsomers thereof: Trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) Dichiorodifluoromethane (GFC-12) DifluoromethanetHFC-32)<br>
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane (HFC-236fa)<br>
-l7lvl73T3-pentafltaoropropane(HF€-245fa) 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane (HFC-365mfc)<br>
"water" C02<br>
The relative amount of any of the above noted components, as well as any additiohal^cornponerTts which may be incTuo'ed in present compositions, may be incorporated in amounts depending on the particular application for the composition, and all such relative amounts are considered to be within the scope hereof, provided preferably that such components do not negate the azeotrope-like nature of the preferred compositions described herein.<br>
The present methods, systems and compositions are thus adaptable for use in connection with automotive air conditioning systems<br><br>
and devices, commercial refrigeration systems and devices, chillers {including systems which utilize centrifugal compressors), residential refrigerator and freezers, general air conditioning systems, heat pumps, and the like.<br>
Any of a wide range of known methods can be used to remove refrigerants to be replaced from a refrigeration system while removing less than a major portion of the lubricant contained in the system. For example, because refrigerants are quite volatile relative to traditional hydrocarbon-based lubricants (the boiling points of refrigerants are generally less than 10°C whereas the boiling points of mineral oils are generally more than 200 °C), in embodiments wherein the lubricant is a hydrocarbon-based lubricant, the removal step may readily be performed by pumping chlorine-containing refrigerants in the gaseous state out of a refrigeration system containing liquid state lubricants. Such removal can -be achieved in any of-a number of ways known in the art, including, the use of a refrigerant recovery system, such as the recovery system manufactured by Robinair of Ohio. Alternatively, a cooled, evacuated refrigerant container can be attached to the low pressure side of a •—refrigeration-system such that the gaseous refrigerant-is drawn4nto the evacuated container and removed. Moreover, a compressor may be attached to-a refrigeration-system to pump-the-refrigerant from the system to an evacuated container. In light of the above disclosure, those of ordinary skill in the art will be readily able to remove chlorine-containing ~1ubrtcants^ramTefrigeration"systems and to provide a refrigeration system having therein a hydrocarbon-based lubricant and substantially no chlorine-containing refrigerant according to the present invention. Any of a wide range of methods for introducing the present refrigerant compositions to a refrigeration system can be used in the present invention. For example, one method comprises attaching a refrigerant container to the low-pressure side of a refrigeration system and turning on the refrigeration system compressor to pull the refrigerant into<br><br>
the system. In such embodiments, the refrigerant container may be placed on a scale such that the amount of refrigerant composition entering the system can be monitored. When a desired amount of refrigerant composition has been introduced into the system, charging is stopped. Alternatively, a wide range of charging tools, known to those of skill in the art, is commercially available. Accordingly, in light of the above disclosure, those of skill in the art will be readily able to introduce the refrigerant compositions of the present invention into refrigeration systems according to the present invention without undue experimentation.<br>
According to certain other embodiments, the present invention provides refrigeration systems comprising a refrigerant of the present    ' invention and methods of producing heating or cooling by condensing and/or evaporating a composition of the present invention. In certain preferred embodiments, the methods for cooling including cooling of other fluid either directly or indirectly or a body directly or indirectly, comprise condensing a refrigerant composition comprising an azeotrope-like composition of the present invention and thereafter evaporating said refrigerant composition in the vicinity of the fluid or body to be cooled. Certain preferred-methods for heating an article comprise condensing a refrigerant composition comprising an azeotrope-like composition of the present invention in the vicinity of the fluid or body to be heated and thereafter evaporating said refrigerant composition. As used herein, the term "body" is intended to refer not only to inanimate objects but also to living tissue, including animal tissue in general and human tissue in particular. For example, certain aspects of the present invention involved application-of the present composition-to human tissue for one or more therapeutic purposes, such as a pain killing technique, as a preparatory anesthetic, or as part of a therapy involving reducing the temperature of the body being treated. In certain embodiments, the application to the body comprises providing the present compositions in liquid form under pressure, preferably in a pressurized container having a one-way<br><br>
discharge valve and/or nozzle, and releasing the liquid from the pressurized container by spraying or otherwise applying the composition to the body. In light of the disclosure herein, those of skill in the art will be readily able to heat and cool articles according to the present inventions without undue experimentation.<br>
Applicants have found that in the systems of the present invention many of the important refrigeration system performance parameters are relatively close to the parameters for R-134a. Since many existing refrigeration systems have-been designed-far R-134a, or for other refrigerants with properties similar to R-134a, those skilled in the art will appreciate the substantial advantage of a low GWP and/or a low ozone depleting refrigerant that can be used as replacement for R-134a or like refrigerants with relatively minimal modifications to the system. It is contemplated that in certain embodiments the present invention provides -retrofitting methods which comprise replacing the refrigerant in an existing system with a composition of the present invention, without substantial modification of the system. In certain preferred embodiments the replacement step is a drop-in replacement in the sense that no substantial H^design ef^he-syslemHS Fequired-afid-neHTiajor^em of-equipment needs to be replaced in order to accommodate the refrigerant of the present ^ inventionrln certain-preferred^embodimentS7-the-methods comprise a drop-in replacement in which the capacity of the system is at least about 70%, preferably at least about 85%, and even more preferably at least "aboat"90%~of the'system capacity prior to replacement ~ In -certain preferred embodiments, the methods comprise a drop-in replacement in which the-suction pressure and/or the discharge pressure of the system, and even more preferably both, is/are at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 90% and even more preferably at least about 95% of the system capacity prior to replacement.   In certain preferred embodiments, the methods comprise a drop-in replacement in which the mass flow of the<br><br>
system is at least about 80%, and even more preferably at least 90% of the system capacity prior to replacement.<br>
In another embodiment, the azeotrope-like compositions of this invention may be used as propellents in sprayable compositions, either alone or in combination with known propellants. The propellent composition comprises, more preferably consists essentially of, and, even more preferably, consists of the azeotrope-like compositions of the invention. The active ingredient to be sprayed together with inert -ingredients, solvents, and other materials may also be present in the sprayable mixture. Preferably, the sprayable composition is an aerosol. Suitable active materials to be sprayed include, without limitation, cosmetic materials such as deodorants, perfumes, hair sprays, and cleaning solvents, as well as medicinal materials such as anti-asthma medications. The term medicinal materials is used herein in its broadest -sense to include-any and all materials which areror at least are believe to be, "effective in connection with therapeutic, diagnostic, pain relief, and similar treatments, and as such would include for example drugs and biologically active substances.<br>
-—-  Yet another-embedfment-ef the present-inveRtion relates to a blowing agent comprising one or more azeotrope-like compositions of the "invention. Ingeneral;the blowing agent may include the azeotrope-like compositions of the present Invention in widely ranging amounts. It is generally preferred, however, that the blowing agents comprise the ~ present azeotrope-like compositions in amounts atleast about 5 % by weight, and even more preferably at least about 15 % by weight, of the -blowing agent. In-certain-preferred embodiments, the blowing agent comprises at least about 50% by weight of the present compositions, and in certain embodiments the blowing agent consists essentially of the present azeotrope-like composition. In certain preferred embodiments, the blowing agent includes, in addition to the present compositions, one or<br><br>
more of co-blowing agents, fillers, vapor pressure modifiers, flame suppressants, stabilizers and like adjuvants.<br>
in other embodiments, the invention provides foamable compositions. The foamable compositions of the present invention . generally include one or more components capable of forming foam having a generally cellular structure and a blowing agent in accordance with the present invention. In certain embodiments, the one or more components comprise a thermosetting composition capable of forming<br>
foam and/or foamable .compositions,	Examples of thermosetting<br>
compositions include polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam compositions, and also phenolic foam compositions,   and methods of preparing foams. In such thermosetting foam embodiments, one or more of the present azeotrope-like compositions are included as a blowing agent in a foamable composition, or as a part of a two or more part foamable composition,,which composition preferably includes one or more additionalcomponents capable of reacting and foaming under the proper conditions to form a foam or cellular structure, as-is well known in the art. In certain other embodiments, the one or more components comprise -thermoplastic-materials, particularlythermoplastic-poiyrners,and/or resins. Examples of thermoplastic foam components include polyolefins, such as -polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethyleneterepthalate (PET), and foams formed therefrom, preferably low-density foams. In certain embodiments, the thermoplastic foamable "composition is an extrudable composition.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, especially in view of -the disclosure contained herein, that the order and manner in which the blowing agent of the present invention is formed and/or added to the foamable composition does not generally affect the operability of the present invention. For example, in the case of extrudable foams, it is possible that the various components of the blowing agent, and even the components of the present composition, be not be mixed in advance of<br><br>
introduction to the extrusion equipment, or even that the components are not added to the same location in the extrusion equipment. Thus, in certain embodiments it may be desired to introduce one or more components of the blowing agent at first location in the extruder,, which is upstream of the place of addition of one or more other components of the blowing agent, with the expectation that the components will come together in the extruder and/or operate more effectively in this manner. Nevertheless, in certain embodiments, two or more components of the blowing agent are combined in advance and introduced together into the foamable composition, either directly or as part of premix which is then further added to other parts of the foamable composition.<br>
The invention also relates to foam, and preferably closed cell foam, prepared from a polymer foam formulation containing a composition of the invention, preferably as part of blowing agent.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, dispersing agents, cell stabilizers, surfactants and other additives may also be incorporated into the blowing agent compositions of the present invention. Surfactants are optionally but preferably added to serve as cell stabifizers. Some representative materials -are-sold undeMhe-flame^of DG-493, B-8404, and L-5340 which are, generafly, polysiloxane polyoxyalkylene block co-polymers such as those disclosed in U:S:-Patent Nos. 2,834,748, 2,917,480, and 2,846,458, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other optional additives for the blowing agent mixture may include flame retardants or suppressants such as tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate, tri(2-chloropropyl)phosphate, tri(2,3-dibFomopropyl)-phosphater-tri(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate, diammonium phosphate, various halogenated aromatic compounds, antimony oxide, aluminum trihydrate, polyvinyl chloride, and the like.<br>
Any of the methods well known in the art, such as those described in "Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technology," Volumes I and II, Saunders and Frisch, 1962, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, which is<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference, may be used or adapted for use in accordance with the foam embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Other uses of the present azeotrope-like compositions include use as solvents, cleaning agents, and the like. Those of skill in the art will be readily able to adapt the present compositions for use in such applications without undue experimentation.<br>

About 18 g HFO-1234 is charged to the ebuHiometer and then HFC-227ea is added in small, measured increments. Temperature depression is observed when HFC-227ea is added to HFO-1234, indicating a binary minimum boiling azeotrope is formed. From greater than about 0 to about 53 weight percent HFC-227ea, the boiling point of the composition changed by about 0.7CC or less. The binary mixtures shown in Table 1 were studied and the boiling point of the compositions changed-by less than about 1°C . The compositions exhibit azeotrope and/or azeotrope-like properties over this range.<br>
