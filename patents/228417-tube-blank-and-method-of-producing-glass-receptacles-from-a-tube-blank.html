				<td>Tube blank and method of producing glass receptacles from a tube blank<br>
The present invention relates to a tube blank for the production of glass<br>
receptacles, in particular glass tube vials, glass ampules, and glass syringes in the<br>
pharmaceutical field, particularly having the features of the preamble of Claim 1,<br>
as well as a method of producing glass receptacles, particularly to be filled with<br>
pharmaceutical products, from a tube blank.<br>
A method of producing glass tube vials from a glass tube blank is previously<br>
known from the publication European Patent B 111 710. In this case, the glass<br>
tube blank is formed from a continuous glass bar. For this purpose, a tube length<br>
is detached from the glass tube strand and softened on both ends. The softened<br>
ends are drawn out axially until the glass tube collapses in this region and closed<br>
tube ends are thus obtained. A point-shaped opening is applied in the direct<br>
proximity of one of the two closed tube ends and the tube length prepared in this<br>
way is inserted in the form of a tube blank into a manufacturing machine and<br>
processed there into glass vials. The tube blank is inserted in the vertical direction<br>
into the manufacturing machine in such a way that the point-shaped opening lies<br>
on the bottom in the vertical direction. The tube wall is moderately heated on the<br>
upper end. Above the point-shaped opening, the tube length is then cut through<br>
thermally, a floor also temporarily forming on the remaining tube blank, which,<br>
however, immediately splits again due to the overpressure which builds up. At this<br>
location, the mouth of the first tube vial is formed. At a distance from this location<br>
which corresponds to the length of the tube vial, the tube blank is then cut through<br>
thermally again, the floor of the first tube vial and a further floor being formed<br>
simultaneously from the remaining tube, which, however, again immediately splits<br>
due to the internal overpressure which builds up. These method steps are<br>
repeated on the remaining tube blank, through which individual tube vials arise,<br>
which have cleanliness suitable for pharmaceutical applications.<br><br>
The tube blanks themselves are typically produced at a different time than the<br>
actual production of the glass receptacles. These blanks are then packaged into<br>
tube packages according to a method such as that described, for example, in the<br>
publication German Patent Application A-27 29 266. they, in the densest packing.<br>
lying next to and on top of one another, being enclosed by a shroud made of<br>
flexible material. In this doubly-protected state, they then reach the glass<br>
receptacle producer, who uses the method already described. To completely seal<br>
the individual tube blanks, the point-shaped opening, which functions as a<br>
ventilation hole, is also resealed by a film. This film is constituted in such a way<br>
that it softens upon moderate heating and then splits open under a slight pressure<br>
or is made of a material which combusts without a residue. In this way, the<br>
cleanliness necessary for pharmaceutical applications is ensured. However, the<br>
manufacturing of the tube blank is distinguished by an elevated outlay in this case.<br>
Furthermore, a part of the tube length of the tube blank is always discarded to<br>
manufacture glass receptacles, in particular glass receptacles for pharmaceutical<br>
applications, specifically the part having the ventilation hole and the remaining part<br>
of the tube blank having a shorter length than the tube vial upon division into the<br>
tube vial lengths. Furthermore, it has also been observed that, from a tube blank<br>
of this type in accordance with the method described, a specific rate of faulty glass<br>
receptacles may only be prevented through precise tailoring of the individual<br>
process parameters during the glass receptacle production.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of providing a method of<br>
producing glass receptacles, in particular for pharmaceutical applications, for<br>
example in the form of glass tube vials, glass ampules, and glass syringes, which<br>
is distinguished by high cost-effectiveness. In this case, optimum usage of the<br>
entire length of the tube blank is particularly desired. Furthermore, the outlay for<br>
manufacturing and control technology for the production of the glass receptacles is<br>
to be kept as low as possible and/or is to be distinguished by a large tolerance<br>
range.<br><br>
The achievement of the object according to the present invention is characterized<br>
by the features of Claims 1 and 5. Advantageous embodiments are described in<br>
the subclaims.<br>
The tube blank according to the present invention for producing glass receptacles,<br>
particularly those suitable for pharmaceutical applications, in particular glass tube<br>
vials, glass ampules, and glass syringes, includes a tube wall having two end<br>
regions, a first end region of the tube wall being closed to form a floor. At least<br>
one ventilation hole is provided in the tube wall in the region of the first end region.<br>
The hole is preferably implemented perpendicularly to the tube blank axis. The<br>
diameter of this ventilation hole is preferably in a range from &gt; o to 
open area present in a typical tube open on both sides. According to the present<br>
invention, the other, second end region is free of a seal, i.e., it has an opening or is<br>
completely open. To manufacture a tube blank of this type, a tube length is<br>
detached from a continuous glass tube strand. One of the two open ends of this<br>
tube length is softened and drawn out, using a force which acts in the axial<br>
direction, until the tube collapses and thus a first floor, which is planar or curved<br>
slightly inward, i.e., directed toward the inner chamber delimited by the tube wall,<br>
is made. After sealing of the one end region, the ventilation hole is then<br>
introduced into the tube wall in the region of this end region. It may be burned in,<br>
for example, using a spot burner. The detachment from a continuous glass tube<br>
strand may be distinguished by a somewhat elevated particle load in the region of<br>
the open end. However, it has been determined that in connection with the<br>
method according to the present invention for producing glass receptacles,<br>
particularly glass receptacles suitable for pharmaceutical applications, this<br>
disadvantage is compensated again by the method steps which then follow, and<br>
glass receptacles having a very high cleanliness, which are therefore suitable for<br>
pharmaceutical applications, may nonetheless be produced. The tube blank<br>
according to the present invention is therefore distinguished by a lower<br>
manufacturing technology outlay than the related art described. Furthermore, no<br>
separate measures are necessary for the transport of the tube blank to the actual<br><br>
manufacturing location for the glass receptacles, and the method of packing in<br>
tube packages already known from the related art may be used.<br>
There are no restrictions in regard to the implementation of the floor on the tube<br>
blank. It may be implemented as planar or curved slightly inward. In this case, the<br>
geometry of the floor is a function of the temperature and the strength of the force<br>
which acts on the tube end region to be sealed.<br>
In order to begin with the production of glass receptacles starting from the open<br>
tube end region, the open end region advantageously has a run-out of &gt; 0 and s 1<br>
mm, preferably8 mm.<br>
To manufacture the glass receptacles, particularly those suitable for use in<br>
pharmaceutical fields, in particular in the form of glass vials, glass ampules, or<br>
glass syringes, from a tube blank designed according to the present invention, the<br>
tube blank is placed in a manufacturing machine and processed there into the<br>
glass tube receptacles. According to the present invention, the tube blank is<br>
preferably inserted vertically into the manufacturing machine in such a way that<br>
the closed end region having the ventilation hole is located on top in the vertical<br>
direction. The second, open end region is then located on the bottom in the<br>
vertical direction. The manufacturing may immediately be begun on the second,<br>
open end region, in that it is heated and the desired mouth form is shaped. At an<br>
interval corresponding to the length of the glass receptacle, the tube blank is then<br>
cut through thermally, starting from the shaped mouth, the floor of the glass<br>
receptacle forming simultaneously during this process. This floor may be<br>
implemented as planar or with a curvature directed into the inner chamber<br>
delimited by the tube wall. The individual method steps are then continuously<br>
repeated on the tube blank, further glass receptacles arising. Preferably, the glass<br>
tube receptacle already manufactured is removed from the guide of the tube blank,<br>
so that the remaining tube blank, having the now open end region, may be pushed<br>
into the position of the glass receptacle now removed. This offers the advantage<br><br>
that the heating and shaping unit for producing the mouth does not have to be<br>
displaced and. if the tube blank is arranged vertically, it may assume this position<br>
solely due to gravity. An essential advantage of this achievement of the object is<br>
that the manufacturing of the glass receptacles may begin immediately, without<br>
discarding material of the tube blank, and, furthermore, due to the ventilation hole,<br>
which is always present, the pressure ratios in the tube blank may be controlled<br>
easily, so that no damage or faulty glass receptacles arise due to possible<br>
pressure spikes in the tube blank. Furthermore, a floor may be implemented on<br>
the remaining tube blank even as it is cut through thermally, this not being<br>
problematic in any way, since the necessary opening and therefore also the mouth<br>
shape may be introduced again through targeted heating of this end region. The<br>
disadvantage of elevated particle load on the open end region which may possibly<br>
result during the production of the tube blank may be compensated through this<br>
method, in particular through targeted heating.<br>
The achievement of the object according to the present invention therefore offers,<br>
particularly in the mass production of glass receptacles, a significant economic<br>
advantage, through the use of a tube blank having an end region closed on one<br>
side and a ventilation hole, in relation to the known achievements of the object<br>
having an end region closed on both sides and a ventilation hole or an end region<br>
closed on one side without a ventilation hole. The preparation by detaching the<br>
region having the ventilation hole may be dispensed with, furthermore, the<br>
pressure ratios may be controlled reliably due to the ventilation hole present, so<br>
that they do not lead to negative interference in the manufacturing of glass<br>
receptacles.<br>
In an especially advantageous embodiment, the heating of the second open end<br>
region is controlled as a function of the desired mouth shape. The advantage is<br>
that an opening having a desired diameter is achieved through the controlled<br>
heating.<br><br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
method is performed automatically. This offers the possibility of a high throughput,<br>
particularly in mass production.<br>
The achievement according to the present invention is elucidated in the following<br>
with reference to figures. The following is illustrated in detail therein:<br>
Figure 1 elucidates a tube blank designed according to the present invention<br>
on the basis of a longitudinal section;<br>
Figure 2 elucidates a schematic, greatly simplified illustration of the basic<br>
principle of the method of producing glass receptacles, particularly<br>
those suitable for use in the pharmaceutical field.<br>
Figure 1 elucidates a schematic, greatly simplified illustration of a longitudinal<br>
section through a tube blank 1 designed according to the present invention, which<br>
is used to produce glass receptacles 2, which may be implemented, for example,<br>
in the form of glass vials, glass ampules, or glass syringes, and which are<br>
particularly suitable for pharmaceutical applications. Tube blank 1 is illustrated in<br>
longitudinal section in this case. It has two end regions, a first end region 3 and a<br>
second end region 4. First end region 3 is sealed in this case. For this purpose, a<br>
floor 6 is provided directly on tube end 5. The floor may be implemented, as in the<br>
case shown, as curved toward inner chamber 7 of the tube blank, which is<br>
delimited by the wall of the floor. A planar implementation of floor 6 (not shown<br>
here) is also conceivable. According to the present invention, tube blank 1 is also<br>
open in a second end region 4. In addition, a ventilation hole 8 is provided, which<br>
is introduced into wall 9 of tube blank 1 and preferably lies near floor 6. The<br>
ventilation hole is formed perpendicularly to tube central axis RM in this case. It is<br>
also positioned in first end region 3.<br><br>
Tube blank 1 is obtained in this case from a continuous glass tube strand of finite<br>
length. In this case, a tube element having length i, which forms tube blank 1, is<br>
detached from the glass tube strand The tube element made in this case is<br>
opened on both end regions. One of the two open end regions of tube length I is<br>
then softened and drawn out by a force acting in the axial direction until the tube<br>
element collapses in this region and a first planar or slightly inwardly curved floor 6<br>
is formed. The second end region, which then corresponds to open end region 4<br>
in finished tube blank 1, remains untreated. The necessary run-out on the open<br>
end region is made possible in this case by the detachment from the glass tube<br>
strand, which is typically performed thermally. Ventilation hole 8 is then introduced<br>
into first end region 3. It is preferably applied using a spot burner.<br>
To perform the method according to the present invention, tube blank 1 thus<br>
arising is then preferably inserted into a manufacturing machine 10 in such a way<br>
that closed end region 3 having ventilation hole 8 lies on top in the vertical<br>
direction. The manufacturing is performed beginning from open end region 4. In<br>
this case, tube wall 9 is moderately heated in open end region 4, for example<br>
using a device 11, the desired mouth for glass receptacle 2 being shaped using a<br>
device 12. Device for heating 11 and device for shaping 12 may also be combined<br>
into one unit in this case.<br>
At a distance a from the open tube end, in particular the mouth which has already<br>
been introduced, tube blank 1 is then cut through thermally, a floor 15 forming on<br>
end region 13 of tube part 14 thus arising, which then forms glass receptacle 2,<br>
during the cutting. Glass receptacle 2 thus made is removed from manufacturing<br>
machine 10 corresponding to the direction of the arrow and the tube blank is<br>
guided downward and/or falls downward in the vertical direction. Second end<br>
region 4', which results on remaining tube blank 1 after removal of glass<br>
receptacle 2, may either be closed again due to the thermal cutting, or may be<br>
provided with an opening. However, this does not play a role in the further<br>
manufacturing, since this second end region 4' is again subjected to heating, also<br><br>
using device 11, and the desired mouth for glass receptacle 2'. i.e., the second<br>
glass receptacle obtained from tube blank 1, is formed using device 12 for<br>
shaping. The pressure ratios in tube blank 1 remain controllable due to existing<br>
ventilation hole 8. The resulting contour of glass tube vial 2' is illustrated using a<br>
dashed line. Glass tube vial 2' is then manufactured after vial 2 is removed from<br>
the machine or at least guided into the position illustrated in Figure 2 for glass tube<br>
vial 2. Following the introduction of the mouth, the cutting procedure on tube blank<br>
1 is again performed at a distance a', end region 13' of tube part 14' thus arising<br>
being sealed by a floor 15' during the cutting process and/or subsequently thereto.<br>
This process may now be continued until the end of tube blank 1, only the upper<br>
part having the ventilation hole being discarded. The manufactunng, beginning at<br>
the open end region, offers the advantage in this case that the production of glass<br>
receptacles may be begun immediately, without planning a part to be exploited,<br>
and the length of tube blank 1 available may be used optimally, since only the<br>
remaining end region having the ventilation hole is discarded and therefore no<br>
complicated calculations in regard to the size of the discard are necessary from<br>
the beginning, as in an embodiment with an end region closed on both sides.<br><br><br><br>
