METHOD AND APPARATUS OF CONTROLLING TRANSMISSION<br>
OF DATA BLOCK<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling<br>
transmission of a data block. Although the present invention is suitable for a wide<br>
scope of applications, it is particularly suitable for controlling data block transmission<br>
more efficiently by measuring round trip time (RTT) and setting a timer using the<br>
measured RTT.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a network structure of a universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (UMTS). Referring to FIG. 1, the universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (hereinafter, referred to as 'UMTS') includes a user<br>
equipment 1 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UE'), a UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
2 (hereinafter, referred to as 'UTRAN') and a core network 3 (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
'CN'). The UTRAN 2 includes at least one radio network sub-system 4 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNS') and each RNS includes a radio network controller 5 (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'RNC') and at least one base station 6 (hereinafter, referred to as 'Node<br>
B') managed by the RNC. The Node B 6 includes at least one cell.<br>
[0003] FIG. 2 is an architectural diagram of UMTS radio protocol between a<br>
UE 1 and UTRAN 2. Referring to FIG. 2, the radio interface protocol horizontally<br>
includes a physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer and the radio interface<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	2	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
protocol vertically includes a user plane for data information transfer and a control<br>
plane for signaling transfer. The protocol layers in FIG, 2 can be divided into L1 (first<br>
layer), L2 (second layer), and L3 (third layer) based on lower three layers of the open<br>
system interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in the communications<br>
systems. The radio protocol layers exist as pairs in both the UE 1 and UTRAN 2 to<br>
facilitate data transmission in the radio section.<br>
[0004] The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer is connected to a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer above the physical layer via transport channels<br>
through which data are transferred between the medium access control layer and the<br>
physical layer. The transport channels are classified as dedicated transport channels and<br>
common transport channels according to whether or not a channel is shared. Data is<br>
transmitted between different physical layers, and more particularly, between the<br>
physical layer of a transmitting side and the physical layer of a receiving side via<br>
physical channels.<br>
[0005] The medium access control (MAC) layer of the second layer provides<br>
services to a radio link control (hereinafter abbreviated RLC) layer above the MAC<br>
layer via logical channels. The RLC layer of the second layer supports reliable data<br>
transfer and is operative in segmentation and concatenation of RLC service data units<br>
(SDUs) sent down from an upper layer.<br>
[0006] The MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the transport<br>
channel. The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer,<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	3	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
a broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[0007] The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and transport<br>
channels and provides allocation of the MAC parameters for allocation and re-allocation<br>
of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer, called the radio link<br>
control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel,<br>
[0008] Various logical channels are provided according to the type of<br>
information transmitted. In general, a control channel is used to transmit information of<br>
the control plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the user plane.<br>
[0009] The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels<br>
and can be divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer,<br>
a MAC-hs sub-layer and a MAC-e sublayer. The division of the MAC is according to<br>
the type of transport channel being managed.<br>
[0010] The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a<br>
transport channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh sub-<br>
layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel (FACH)<br>
or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of terminals, or in<br>
the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). The MAC-d sub-layer manages a<br>
dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a specific terminal.<br>
The MAC-hs sublayer manages a transport channel HS-DSCH (high speed downlink<br>
shared channel) for high speed data transfer to support the high speed data transfer in<br>
downlink and uplink. The MAC-e sublayer manages a transport channel E-DCH<br>
(enhanced dedicated channel) for uplink data transfer.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	4	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[0011] The radio link control (hereinafter abbreviated 'RLC') layer supports a<br>
guarantee of quality of service (hereinafter abbreviated 'QoS') of each radio bearer and<br>
also controls the transfer of corresponding data. The RLC layer leaves one independent<br>
RLC entity at each RB to guarantee intrinsic QoS of the RB. Three RLC modes are<br>
provided to support various QoS; a transparent mode (hereinafter abbreviated 'TM'), an<br>
unacknowledged mode (hereinafter abbreviated 'UM') and an acknowledged mode<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated 'AM').<br>
[0012] The RLC also facilitates adjusting a data size to enable a lower layer to<br>
transfer data to a radio section. To facilitate an adjusted data size, the RLC segments<br>
and concatenates data received from an upper layer.<br>
[0013] The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer and facilitates<br>
transferring data using IP packets, such as IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently in a radio section<br>
having a relatively small bandwidth. Toward this end, the PDCP layer performs header<br>
compression, a function by which mandatory data header information is transferred to<br>
increase transport efficiency in a radio section.<br>
[0014] Since header compression is a basic function of the PDCP layer, the<br>
PDCP layer exists only in a packet service domain (hereinafter abbreviated 'PS<br>
domain'). Furthermore, one PDCP entity exists for each RB in order to provide an<br>
effective header compression function to each PS service.<br>
[0015] The BMC (broadcast/multicast control) layer is located above the RLC<br>
layer. The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast message and performs broadcasting to<br>
UEs located in a specific cell.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	5	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[0016] A radio resource control (RRC) layer located on the lowest part of the<br>
third layer is defined in the control plane only and controls the logical channels, the<br>
transport channels, and the physical channels with configuration, reconfiguration, and<br>
release of radio bearers (RBs). A RB is a logical path provided by the first and second<br>
layers for the data transfer between the UE 1 and the UTRAN 2. Generally, configuring<br>
an RB refers to defining the characteristics of protocol layers and channels necessary for<br>
providing a specific service and is to establish respective specific parameters and<br>
operational methods for them.<br>
[0017] Basic functions of the RLC layer are to guarantee QoS of each RB and a<br>
corresponding data transfer. Since an RB service is a service that the second layer<br>
provides to an upper layer, the entire second layer affects QoS. However, the RLC layer<br>
has the greatest effect on QoS.<br>
[0018] The RLC layer provides an independent RLC entity at each RB to<br>
guarantee the intrinsic QoS of aa RB and provides three modes, specifically TM, UM<br>
and AM. Since the three RLC modes differ from one another in the supported QoS,<br>
their operational methods are different as well as their detailed functions. Therefore, the<br>
RLC operational mode must be considered.<br>
[0019] TM RLC is a mode in which no overhead is attached to an RLC service<br>
data unit (hereinafter abbreviated 'SDU') that is delivered from a higher layer in<br>
configuring an RLC protocol data unit (hereinafter abbreviated TDU'). Since the RLC<br>
transmits the SDU transparently, it is called TM RLC.<br>
[0020] Due to these transparent characteristics, the TM RLC plays various roles<br>
in user and control planes. In the user plane, the TM RLC performs real-time circuit<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	6	PCT/KR2006/001139<br><br>
data transfer, such as voice or streaming data, in a circuit service domain (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated 'CS domain') since data processing time within RLC is short. In the control<br>
plane, the RLC controls uplink transmission of RRC messages from an unspecific UE or<br>
downlink transmission of RRC messages broadcast from all UEs with a cell since there<br>
is no overhead within the RLC.<br>
[0021] Unlike the transparent mode, a non-transparent mode is a mode in which<br>
overhead is added in the RLC. Non-transparent modes are classified into an<br>
unacknowledged mode (UM), having no acknowledgement for the transmitted data, and<br>
an acknowledged mode (AM), having acknowledgement for the transmitted data.<br>
[0022] By attaching a PDU header including a sequence number (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated 'SN') to each PDU, UM RLC enables a receiving side to determine which<br>
PDU is lost in the course of transmission. Due to this characteristic, the UM RLC<br>
primarily performs transmission of real-time packet data, such as broadcast/multicast<br>
data transmission, voice of PS domain, (such as, VoIP) and streaming data in the user<br>
plane or transmission of RRC messages transmitted to a specific UE or specific UE<br>
group within a cell in control plane that require no acknowledgement.<br>
[0023] AM RLC is a non-transparent mode that configures PDUs by attaching a<br>
PDU header, including an SN, as in UM RLC. However, AM RLC differs from UM<br>
RLC in that a receiving side acknowledges the PDUs transmitted by a transmitting side.<br>
[0024] The receiving side acknowledges PDU reception in the AM RLC<br>
because the transmitting side can request retransmission of a PDU that is not received<br>
by the receiving side. The retransmission function is the most outstanding feature of the<br>
AM RLC.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	7	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[0025] An object of the AM RLC is to guarantee error-free data transmission<br>
through retransmission. Due to this characteristic, the AM RLC primarily controls<br>
transmission of non-real-time packet data, such as TCP/IP of PS domain in the user<br>
plane, or transmission of RRC messages transmitted to a specific UE within a cell in<br>
control plane for which acknowledgment is mandatory.<br>
[0026] TM or DM RLC is used for uni-directional communications, whereas<br>
AM RLC is used for bi-directional communications due to the feedback from a<br>
receiving side in AM RLC. Since bi-directional communications are primarily used for<br>
point-to-point communications, AM RLC uses only a dedicated logical channel.<br>
Therefore, one RLC entity includes a transmission or reception structure in TM or UM<br>
RLC, whereas a transmitting side and a receiving side exist within one RLC entity in<br>
AM RLC.<br>
[0027] The complexity of AM RLC is due to the retransmission function. The<br>
AM RLC includes a retransmission buffer for retransmission management as well as a<br>
transmitting/receivtng buffer and performs various functions. The various functions may<br>
be related to a transmitting/receiving window for flow control, polling when a<br>
transmitting side requests status information from a corresponding RLC entity of a<br>
receiving side, status reporting in order that a receiving side may report its buffer status<br>
to a corresponding RLC entity of a transmitting side, status PDU for carrying status<br>
information and piggybacking by inserting a status PDU in a data PDU to increase data<br>
transfer efficiency.<br>
[0028] A reset PDU is required in order to request the resetting of all operations<br>
and parameters of an AM RLC entity of the other side if an AM RLC entity discovers a<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	8	PCT/KR2006/001139<br><br>
critical error during the course of operation, A reset ACK PDU is required for response<br>
to the reset PDU.<br>
[0029] To support these functions, an AM RLC needs various protocol<br>
parameters, status variables and a timer. PDUs used for data transfer control in status<br>
information reporting, status PDUs and reset PDUs are called control PDUs and PDUs<br>
used for delivery of user data are called data PDUs.<br>
[0030] Specifically, PDUs used by an AM RLC may be classified into two<br>
types. A first type is a data PDU and a second type is a control PDU. Control PDUs<br>
include status PDU, piggybacked status PDUs, reset PDUs and reset ACK PDUs.<br>
[0031] As mentioned previously control PDUs are used for a reset procedure.<br>
The reset procedure is used in response to an error condition during operation of an AM<br>
RLC.<br>
[0032] For example, an error condition may result if mutually used sequence<br>
numbers are different from each other or a PDU or an SDU transmission fails in excess<br>
of a count limit. Through the reset procedure, an AM RLC of a receiving side and an<br>
AM RLC of a transmitting side reset environmental variables and then communications<br>
are re-enabled.<br>
[0033] Once an AM RLC entity, such as an AM RLC of a transmitting side,<br>
decides to initiate a reset procedure, a currently used transmitting direction hyper frame<br>
number (hereinafter abbreviated 'HFN') value is included in a reset PDU and the reset<br>
PDU is transmitted to the corresponding AM RLC entity on the other side, such as an<br>
AM RLC of a receiving side. The AM RLC of the receiving side, having received the<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	9	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
reset PDU, re-establishes an HFN value of its receiving direction and then resets<br>
environmental variables, such as a sequence number.<br>
[0034] Subsequently, the AM RLC of the receiving side includes its<br>
transmitting direction HFN in a reset ACK PDU and then transmits the reset ACK PDU<br>
to the AM RLC of the transmitting side. Upon receiving the reset ACK PDU, the AM<br>
RLC of the transmitting side re-establishes its receiving direction HFN value and then<br>
resets environmental variables.<br>
[0035] FIG. 3 illustrates the structure of an AM RLC PDU. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3, an AM RLC PDU is used when an AM RLC entity attempts to transmit user<br>
data or piggybacked status information anci a polling bit. A user data portion is<br>
configured as an 8-bit integer multiplication and an AM RLC PDU header is<br>
constructed with a 2-octet sequence number. The header part of an AM RLC PDU<br>
includes a length indicator.<br>
[0036] FIG. 4 illustrates the structure of a status PDU. As illustrated in FIG. 4,<br>
a status PDU includes different types of SUFIs (super fields). The status PDU size is<br>
variable, but is limited to a size of the largest RLC PDU of a logical channel carrying<br>
the status PDU.<br>
[0037] The SUFI is utilized to identify what type of AM RLC PDU is received<br>
at a receiving side or what type of AM RLC PDU is not received at the receiving side.<br>
The SUFI consists of three parts that indicate type, length and value.<br>
[0038] FIG. 5 illustrates the structure of a piggybacked status PDU. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5, the structure of a piggybacked status PDU, while similar to that of<br>
a status PDU, differs in that a reserved bit (R2) replaces the D/C field. The piggybacked<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	10	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
status PDU is inserted if there is sufficient space in an AM RLC PDU. The PDU type<br>
value may be fixed at' 000'.<br>
[0039] FIG. 6 illustrates the structure of a reset ACK PDU. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6, a reset PDU includes a 1-bit sequence number (RSN). A reset ACK PDU is<br>
transmitted in response to a received reset PDU by including the RSN contained in the<br>
received reset PDU.<br>
[0040] The 'D/C field' indicates whether a corresponding PDU is a control<br>
PDU or a data PDU. The TDU Type' indicates a type of the control PDU and,<br>
specifically, whether a corresponding PDU is a reset PDU or a status PDU. The<br>
'Sequence Number' value indicates sequence number information of an AM RLC PDU.<br>
[0041] The 'Polling Bit' value is set when a request for a status report is made<br>
to a receiving side. The 'Extension bit (E)' value indicates whether a next octet is a<br>
length indicator. The 'Reserved bit (R1)' value is used for a reset PDU or a reset ACK<br>
PDU and is coded as '000'. The 'Header Extension Bit (HE)' value indicates whether a<br>
next octet is a length indicator or data. The 'Length Indicator' value indicates a location<br>
of a boundary if a boundary exists between different SDUs within a data part of a PDU.<br>
The 'PAD' part is a padding area and is not used in an AM RLC PDU.<br>
[0042] A method of reducing reception error in an AM RLC entity is explained<br>
as follows. Unlike an UM RLC or TM RLC, error-free data transmission is important<br>
for an AM RLC.<br>
[0043] Specifically, if a receiving side fails to successfully receive an AM RLC<br>
PDU transmitted by a transmitting side, the transmitting side keeps transmitting the AM<br>
RLC PDUs until they are successfully received. The receiving side informs the<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	11	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
transmitting side of reception or failure of the AM RLC PDUs. Included in the<br>
information is a status PDU or a piggybacked status PDU.<br>
[0044] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a conventional AM RLC PDU<br>
transmitting method according to a first example. As illustrated in FIG. 7, a transmitting<br>
side RLC transmits a first AM RLC PDU, a second AM RLC PDU and a third AM<br>
RLC PDU.<br>
[0045] Assuming that the second AM RLC PDU is lost during transmission, a<br>
receiving side RLC is unable to receive the second AM RLC PDU. Therefore, the<br>
receiving side RLC determines that the second AM RLC PDU is lost and informs the<br>
transmitting side, via a status PDU, that the second AM RLC PDU was not received.<br>
[0046] The transmitting side retransmits the second AM RLC PDU in response<br>
to the status PDU received from the receiving side. If the receiving side successfully<br>
receives the retransmitted second AM RLC PDU, the AM RLC PDU transmitting<br>
process is terminated.<br>
[0047] As illustrated in FIG. 7, the receiving side transmits the status PDU if an<br>
AM RLC PDU is not received, if the transmitting side polls the receiving side AM RLC<br>
PDU or if a receiving side transmission interval timer (Timer_Status jperiodic) expires.<br>
The transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) is provided to enable the<br>
receiving side to send a status PDU periodically and the receiving side transmits the<br>
status PDU each time the transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) expires.<br>
[0048] However, the status PDU includes no data, but rather only control<br>
information. Unlike an AM RLC PDU, which includes data, the status PDU lowers a<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	12	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
real data rate. Therefore, to prevent the status PDU from being sent too frequently, a<br>
timer, such as a transmission prohibit interval (Timer_Status_Prohibit) timer, is utilized.<br>
[0049] The transmission prohibit interval (Timer_Status_Prohibit) timer is<br>
initialized each time the receiving side transmits the status PDU. While the transmission<br>
prohibit interval (TimerJ5tatus_Prohibit) timer is active, the receiving side is prevented<br>
from transmitting a status PDU.<br>
[0050] FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a conventional AM RLC PDU<br>
transmitting method according to a second example. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the<br>
receiving side determines that a second AM RLC PDU was lost and initiates a<br>
transmission interval timer (Timer _Status_periodic) and a transmission prohibit interval<br>
timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) while transmitting a status PDU.<br>
[0051] Upon receiving a fifth AM RLC PDU, the receiving side determines that<br>
a fourth AM RLC PDU was lost. However, since the transmission prohibit interval<br>
timer (Timer__status _Prohibit) has not expired, the receiving side does not transmit the<br>
status PDU despite having determined that a second PDU was lost.<br>
[0052] Also as illustrated in FIG. 8, a re-transmission of the second AM RLC<br>
PDU fails as well. However, the receiving side is unable to determine whether the<br>
second AM RLC PDU was retransmitted from the transmitting side. The retransmitted<br>
second AM RLC PDU may have been lost or the status PDU previously sent by the<br>
receiving side to indicate loss at the second AM RLC PDU may have been lost and not<br>
delivered to the transmitting side. Therefore, the receiving side again sends the status<br>
PDU to the transmitting side to indicate loss of the second AM RLC PDU.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	13	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[0053] The transmission prohibit interval tinier (Timer_Starus_prohibit)<br>
determines an interval for retransmitting the status PDU. In the previous example, if the<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_Status_prohibit) expires, the receiving side<br>
immediately transmits the status PDU to the transmitting side again.<br>
[0054] Since the transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_Status_prohibit)<br>
expires, there is no limitation on the AM RLC transmitting the status PDU. Upon<br>
receiving the retransmitted status PDU, the transmitting side retransmits the second AM<br>
RLC PDU one again time. Therefore, the receiving side can receive data without error<br>
in operation of the AM RLC.<br>
[0055] FIG. 9 illustrates a conventional AM RLC PDU transmitting method<br>
according to a third example. As illustrated in FIG. 9, it is assumed that there is no<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_Status_rohibit) and that a transmission<br>
interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) is set to a very short value.<br>
[0056] A receiving side again sends a status PDU indicating loss of the second<br>
AM RLC PDU before receiving the retransmitted second AM RLC PDU from a<br>
transmitting side. Therefore, the transmitting side decides that the retransmitted second<br>
AM RLC PDU was also lost in transmission and retransmits the second AM RLC PDU<br>
once more. However, if the receiving side successfully receives the first retransmission<br>
of the second AM RLC PDU, the second retransmission of the second AM RLC PDU<br>
unnecessarily wastes radio resources.<br>
[0057] On the other hand, if the transmission interval timer<br>
(Timer__Status__periodic) is set to too long a value, a delay before the transmitting side<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	14	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
attempts the retransmission is increased. Due to the increased delay, QoS (quality of<br>
service) is degraded.<br>
[0058] If a value of the transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) or<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) is set closer to a time<br>
required for a transmitting side of a UE to receive a corresponding status response after<br>
having sent an AM RLC PDU to a receiving side, system performance can be enhanced.<br>
Such a time required for the transmitting to receive a corresponding status response<br>
back from the receiving side is called a round-trip time (hereinafter abbreviated 'RTT').<br>
[0059] In conventional methods, a value of a transmission interval timer<br>
(Timer_Status_periodic) or a transmission prohibit interval timer<br>
(Timer_status_Prohibit) is determined when a UE and a serving RNC (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated 'SRNC') first configure a RB and the value is unilaterally selected by the<br>
SRNC. However, since the SRNC has no measurement value for data transmission of an<br>
AM RLC to a UE, the SRNC is unable to select a correct RTT value. Therefore, the<br>
value of the transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) or transmission<br>
prohibit interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) cannot be set to a correct value.<br>
[0060] Furthermore, since a UE keeps moving between cells and since a<br>
processor load of the UE or base station fluctuates, an RTT value varies. Therefore, it is<br>
necessary to keep updating the value of the transmission interval timer<br>
(Timer_Status_periodic) or transmission prohibit interval timer (Tnner_status_Prohibit).<br>
However, these values are determined by the RRC of the SRNC and provided to the<br>
RRC of a UE and the RRC of the UE informs the RLC of the UE of the values to use.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	15	PCT/KR2006/0O1139<br>
[0061] Moreover, signaling between the RECs takes a lot of time and the timer<br>
values are basic attributes of an RB. Therefore, whenever these values are changed, a<br>
complicated RB reconfiguration process is required. As a result, an incorrect value of<br>
the transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) or transmission prohibit interval<br>
timer (Trmer_status_Prohibit) degrades RLC performance and the conventional<br>
signaling using the RRC limits the RLC performance as well.<br>
[0062] Therefore, there is a need for a system for controlling data block<br>
transmission more efficiently by measuring round trip time (RTT) and setting a timer<br>
using the measured RTT. The present invention addresses this and other needs.<br>

BEST MOPE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[00112] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for controlling<br>
a transmission of data blocks by which data block transmission can be controlled more<br>
efficiently by measuring the RTT and setting a control timer value according to the<br>
measured RTT. Although the present invention is illustrated with respect to a mobile<br>
communication device, it is contemplated that the present invention may be utilized<br>
anytime it is desired to more efficiently control a transmission of data blocks by<br>
measuring a round trip time and setting a control timer value according to the measured<br>
time.<br>
[00113] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[00114] The present invention enables an AM RLC entity to operate with an<br>
optimal transmission interval timer (timer_Status__periodic) value and an optimal<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	29	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) value, thereby providing a<br>
service more efficiently by increasing the data rate. The present invention provides a<br>
method to enable an RLC entity to measure a round-trip time (RTT) value and set a<br>
transmission interval timer (timer_Status_periodic) value and a transmission prohibit<br>
interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) value using the measured RTT value,<br>
[00115] An AM RNC uses a status PDU or piggybacked status PDU to measure<br>
an RTT value. Specifically, an AM RLC attempting to measure the RTT sends a<br>
message requesting RTT measurement to an AM RLC of the other side. An AM RLC<br>
entity, having received the message, transmits a corresponding response.<br>
[00116] The requesting AM RLC uses the status PDU or the piggybacked status<br>
PDU to send the RTT measurement request message. Specifically, the AM RLC<br>
includes the RTT measurement request (SUFI) in a transmitted status PDU or<br>
piggybacked status PDU.<br>
[00117] The AM RLC of the other side uses the status PDU or the piggybacked<br>
status PDU to transmit an RTT measurement response message in response to the RTT<br>
measurement request message. Specifically, the AM RLC includes the RTT<br>
measurement response SUFI in a transmitted status PDU or a piggybacked status PDU.<br>
[00118] Since the RTT measurement request or response message is transmitted<br>
through a radio section, it may be lost in the radio section. Therefore, for more accurate<br>
RTT measurement, a sequence number is attached to the AM RLC PDU that includes<br>
the RTT measurement request so that a measuring side can identify the RTT<br>
measurement response message.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	30	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[00119] The requesting AM RLC attaches a sequence number to each RTT<br>
measurement request message. Upon receiving the RTT measurement response message,<br>
the requesting AM RLC processes the RTT measurement response message if a value<br>
equal to the sequence number that was sent by the AM RLC is received. If an RTT<br>
measurement response message including a value different from the sequence number<br>
that was sent by the AM RLC is received, the requesting AM RLC deletes the message<br>
or does not process the message.<br>
[00120] The requesting AM RLC records a time at which each RTT<br>
measurement request message is transmitted. Each time an RTT measurement request<br>
message is received, the measuring AM RLC checks the sequence number included in<br>
the RTT measurement request message. Upon sending an RTT measurement response<br>
message, the measuring AM RLC includes a value equal to the sequence number from<br>
the RTT request message in the RTT measurement response message.<br>
[00121] To measure a real RTT value, the requesting AM RLC waits for an RTT<br>
measurement response message after sending an RTT measurement request message.<br>
Upon receiving the RTT measurement response message, the requesting AM RLC<br>
checks a sequence number included in the received RTT measurement response<br>
message.<br>
[00122] If the sequence number is equal to the sequence number previously sent<br>
by the AM RNC in the RTT measurement request message, the AM RNC determines a<br>
difference between the time the RTT measurement response message was received and<br>
the time the RTT measurement request message was sent The AM RNC then uses the<br>
determined difference as a measured RTT value.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	31	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[00123] The requesting AM RLC executes the RTT measurement process several<br>
times to increase reliability of the measurement and to remove variable factors in<br>
measurement The AM RLC determines an average of the measured RTT values for use<br>
as an estimated value of real RTT. By determining an average value, a UE can use a<br>
number of samples as indicated by a base station.<br>
[00124] Subsequently, the requesting AM RNC can set the estimated RTT as a<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer _status_Prohibit) value or a transmission<br>
interval timer (Timer_Starus_periodic) value. Alternately, the requesting AM RNC may<br>
set the transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit) value or<br>
transmission interval timer (Timer_Status_periodic) value by processing the estimated<br>
RTT according to parameters indicated by a base station.<br>
[00125] FIG. 10 illustrates a flowchart of an RTT measuring and setting method<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 10, once a<br>
transmitting side initiates an RTT measurement (S101), an RTT measurement request<br>
message is created and a sequence number is included in the message and recorded in a<br>
transmitting side memory (S102). The created RTT measurement request message is<br>
transmitted to a receiving side and a time at which the RTT measurement request<br>
message is transmitted is recorded in the transmitting side memory (S1 03).<br>
[00126] A receiving side, upon receiving the RTT measurement request message<br>
transmitted by the transmitting side (S104), transmits an RTT measurement response<br>
message to the transmitting side (S106). After transmitting the RTT measurement<br>
request message, the transmitting side waits for an RTT measurement response message<br>
(S107). Upon receiving the RTT measurement response message, the transmitting side<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	32	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
records a reception time of the RTT measurement response message in the transmitting<br>
side memory (S108).<br>
[00127] The transmitting side checks a sequence number included in the received<br>
RTT measurement response message (S109). If the sequence number in the RTT<br>
measurement response message is equal to the sequence number in the transmitted RTT<br>
measurement request message, the RTT is calculated using the recorded transmission<br>
time and the recorded reception time (S110).<br>
[00128] However, for accurate RTT measurement, the receiving side AM RLC<br>
must send an RTT measurement response immediately upon receiving an RTT<br>
measurement request. In order to accomplish this, an RTT measurement response<br>
message can be immediately transmitted without previously set limitations, such as a<br>
transmission prohibit interval timer (Timer_status_Prohibit). Furthermore, for more<br>
effective measurement, the transmitting side AM RLC can be free from previously set<br>
limitations with regard to sending an RTT measurement request.<br>
[00129] FIG. 11 illustrates an RTT measurement response SUFI according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG 10 and FIG 11, 'TYPE' is an<br>
identifier to identify various types of SUFIs and ' Sequence Number' indicates an RTT<br>
measurement response SUFI corresponding to an RTT measurement request SUFI<br>
[00130] Unlike a status PDU, a pi ggybacked status PDU, which replaces<br>
padding of an AM RLC PDU, has no additional overhead. Therefore, to reduce<br>
overhead due to the RTT measurement request message, the RTT measurement request<br>
message can be included only in a piggybacked status PDU.<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	33	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
[00131] However, if RTT measurements are performed too frequently, system<br>
performance may be affected. To reduce the effect upon system performance, a network<br>
can restrict RTT measurements performed by an AM entity. In order to restrict RTT<br>
measurements, an RTT measurement prohibit interval timer can be used. Specifically,<br>
after an RTT measurement request has been sent or after an RTT measurement process<br>
has been completed, the AM entity initiates the RTT measurement prohibit interval<br>
timer. A UE is unable to initiate a new RTT measurement process until the RTT<br>
measurement prohibit interval timer expires.<br>
[00132] To increase accuracy of the RTT measurement process, an AM entity<br>
can send an RTT measurement request message and an RTT measurement response<br>
message consecutively. In this way, the probability of losing each message in a radio<br>
section is lowered and sequence numbers of the consecutively sent messages are equal<br>
to each other. The number of the consecutively sent messages can be determined by the<br>
network and indicated to a UE.<br>
[00133] If an AM entity periodically performs the RTT measurement, it can be<br>
prevent a difference between an actual RTT value and an RTT value determined by a<br>
UE from deviating considerably. For periodically performing the RTT measurement, an<br>
RTT measurement period timer (periodic timer) is defined. A network can inform a UE<br>
of a value of the RTT measurement prohibit interval timer and a value of the RTT<br>
measurement period timer (periodic timer).<br>
[00134] An AM entity initiates the RTT measurement period timer (periodic<br>
timer). Whenever the RTT measurement period timer (periodic timer) expires, the AM<br>
entity initiates the RTT measurement process. Each time the RTT measurement process<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	27	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
is completed, the AM entity activates the RTT measurement period timer (periodic<br>
timer) again.<br>
[00135] Since the RTT measurement request message or the RTT measurement<br>
response message can be lost in the radio section, the RTT measurement response<br>
message may not arrive at the side having made the request for the RTT measurement.<br>
An RTT measurement waiting timer can be defined to prevent a side having sent an<br>
RTT measurement request message from awaiting the RTT measurement response<br>
message indefinitely.<br>
[00136] After transmitting an RTT measurement response message, the AM<br>
entity activates the RTT measurement waiting timer. If the RTT measurement response<br>
message is not received before the RTT measurement waiting timer expires, the AM<br>
entity sends the RTT measurement request message again. This retransmission process<br>
cannot be repeated indefinitely. To restrict the retransmission process, a count limit of<br>
RTT measurement request retransmissions can be set.<br>
[00137] In order to remove ambiguity of each retransmission, a sequence number<br>
can be changed each time the RTT measurement request is retransmitted. The sequence<br>
number can simply be incremented by' 1' each time the RTT measurement request is<br>
retransmitted. To increase efficiency, each time the RTT measurement request is<br>
retransmitted, a value of the RTT measurement waiting timer is increased to<br>
accommodate a change of a lower layer.<br>
[00138] If an AM PDU is not received by an AM entity, the AM entity transmits<br>
a status PDU. If a correspondiag response is not received within a uniform duration or if<br>
a transmission count of the status PDU indicating that a specific AM PDU is not<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	35	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
received exceeds a predetermined value, the AM entity executes the RTT measurement<br>
process. Furthermore, if an AM PDU that is indicated as not having been received in<br>
the status PDU arrives within a time that is shorter than a previously measured RTT<br>
value or a time that is shorter than the transmission prohibit interval timer<br>
(Tirner_status_Probibit) value, the AM entity executes the RTT measurement process.<br>
Furthermore,<br>
[00139] Whenever the RTT value is updated, the AM entity updates an<br>
associated timer value. The AM entity can appropriately set values associated with<br>
polling, such as a polling timer (Timer poll) or a polling prohibit interval timer<br>
(Timer_Poll_prohibit).<br>
[00140] The AM entity can also include the time of message transmission when<br>
transmitting an RTT measurement request message. In this way, the time included in the<br>
RTT measurement request message is a time that can be determined by the AM entities<br>
of both sides. Furthermore, the time included can be a system frame number (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated 'SFN') as a time reference applied to all UEs located within one cell or a<br>
connection frame number (hereinafter abbreviated 'CFN') managed in common by one<br>
UE and one SRNC.<br>
[00141 ] Therefore, one side, having received the RTT measurement request<br>
message, can obtain the transmission time in one direction using the difference between<br>
the time included in the message and the time at which the message was received.<br>
Similarly, if the time of transmission of the RTT measurement response message is<br>
included in the response message, the side receiving the RTT measurement response<br>
message can calculate a portion of RTT using the difference between the time the<br><br>
WO 2006/104341	36	PCT/KR2006/001139<br>
message was received and the time included in the message. The RTT can then be found<br>
by multiplying the measured time by' 2'.<br>
[00142] Accordingly, the present invention sets a control timer by measuring an<br>
RTT value, thereby transmitting data blocks more efficiently,<br>
