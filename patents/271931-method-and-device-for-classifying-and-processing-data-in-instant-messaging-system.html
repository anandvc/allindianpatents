				<td>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CLASSIFYING AND PROCESSING DATA IN INSTANT MESSAGING SYSTEM<br>
nELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of instant messaging, and in particular to a method and device for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a commonly-used network communication tool, the instant messaging system provides more and more functions. Typically, it is required to perform a first authentication when logging in the instant messaging systeift; After passing the first authentication, the user may use the instant messaging service included in the instant messaging system. Through the instant messaging system, another service, such as email, personal webpage, network hard disk and the like, may be linked as required. In order to facilitate operation, the display panel of the instant messaging system is configured with the link identifier of a relevant service, by clicking which the page of the relevant service may be linked. However, the service with more security requirements needs to perform a second authentication for the user when it is started.<br>
Thus, when the non-instant messaging service included in the instant messaging system is used, it is required to perform the second authentication for the non-instant messaging service. In the instant messaging system of the prior art, the second authentication is configured according to the type of service, and the second authentication needs to be performed when it is required to access any data of the non-instant messaging service. Although to perform the second authentication for every data of the non-instant messaging service may help in increasing the security of the corresponding service of the instant messaging system, the user has to remember respective passwords corresponding to various services, thus the user cannot use the non-instant messaging service included in the instant messaging system easily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The embodiment of the present invention provides a method for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system, which includes: classifying the data of every service included in the instant messaging system into confidential data and non-confidential data; obtaining and processing the non-confidential data of every service after a first authentication is passed successfully; and obtaining and processing the confidential data of every service after a second authentication is passed successfully.<br><br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a device for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system, which includes: a data classifying unit, adapted to classify the data of every service included in the instant messaging system into confidential data and non-confidential data; a non-confidential data obtaining unit, adapted to obtain, when the service is activated, the non-confidential data of every service after a first authentication is passed successfully; a second authentication unit, adapted to implement a second authentication of the instant messaging system, and to send confirmation information used for indicating that the second authentication is passed successfully after the second authenticatibn is passed successfully; and a confidential data obtaining unit, adapted to obtain the confidential data of the service after receiving the confirmation information used for indicating that the second authentication is passed successfully sent from the second authentication unit.<br>
According to the method and device for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system provided by the embodiment of the present invention, the data of every service provided by the instant messaging system is classified into confidential data and non-confidential data, the non-confidential data is obtained and processed after a first authentication is passed successfully, and the confidential data is obtained and processed after a second authentication is passed successfully. According to the embodiment of the present invention, once a certain service is activated in the instant messaging system, the user can thus perform a non-confidential data related operation of the service, hence facilitating the user. If the user wishes to operate the confidential data, the second authentication is required to be performed, so as to ensure the security of the data of the service that needs to be confidential. Being compared with the prior art where it is required to perform the second authentication for all operations of every non-instant messaging service included in the instant messaging system, the method and device according to the embodiment of the present invention not only meet the security requirements of the instant messaging system, but also facilitate the user to use various services of the instant messaging system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
For better understanding of the objects, features and advantages of the present invention, the present invention is described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings and the embodiments.<br>
Figure' 1 is a flowchart illustrating a method for service classification and processing in an instant messaging system of the prior art. The method includes steps as follows.<br>
Step SlOl: After being started normally based on a first authentication, the instant messaging system provides an instant messaging service normally, with the identifier of a non-instant messaging service being displayed on the display panel of the instant messaging system, where the user may click the corresponding identifier of the service according to service requirements. The non-instant messaging service includes: email, personal webpage, network hard disk, etc.<br>
After the identifier of the service is activated, the page of the service is linked.<br>
For example, if the user clicks the identifier of email in the instant messaging system, the page of the email of the user is linked.<br><br>
Step S102: A separate password is inputted so as to perform a second authentication.<br>
The instant messaging system pops up a dialog box to ask the user to input the separate password which is different from the instant messaging password, so as to perform the second authentication for the user's Identity.<br>
For example, the user inputs the password corresponding to the email system into the dialog box to perform the second authentication.<br>
Step S103: After the authentication is passed successfully, all of the data of the corresponding service is obtained and processed, and the corresponding service is provided for the user.<br>
The instant messaging system authenticates the separate password inputted by the user. If it is identical to the preset separate password, the authentication is passed successfully, and the data of the corresponding service is obtained and processed and the corresponding service is provided for the user. If it is different from the preset separate password, error information is returned.<br>
It can be understood from the above steps that in prior art, depending on various service types provided by the instant messaging system, the data of the instant messaging system is processed after the second authentication is passed successfully. Thus in the prior art, the second authentication is performed for every data of the non-instant messaging service. Although this may help in increasing the security of the corresponding service of the instant messaging system, the user has to remember respective passwords corresponding to various services, thus the user cannot use the non-instant messaging service included in the instant messaging system easily.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the data of all the services provided by the instant messaging system is processed according to whether the data needs to be confidential, instead of processing the data according to the type of the service. The data of every service that does not need to be confidential is provided for the user after the first authentication is passed successfully. The second authentication is performed only when the user needs to access the confidential data of those services, thus facilitating the user to use the service of the instant messaging system and ensuring the security of the instant messaging system.<br>
Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The method includes steps as follows.<br>
Step 8201: The data of every service provided by the instant messaging system is classified into confidential data and non-confidential data. The classified data may be<br><br>
included with a confidential-or-not flag used for indicating whether the data can be displayed so as to be processed by the user after the first authentication is passed successfully.<br>
The services provided by the instant messaging system include: the instant messaging service provided by the instant messaging system itself, a plurality of non-instant messaging services connected with and provided by the instant messaging system. The non-instant messaging service includes: email, network hard disk, personal webpage, etc. Specifically, the process of classifying the data of every service provided by the instant messaging system includes: classifying the data of the instant messaging service and the non-instant messaging service provided by the instant messaging system into confidential data and non-confidential data. Specifically, the email service involves data of new mail, data of received mail, data in draft box, other relevant data, etc. The network hard disk service includes resource data of TV drama program, resource data of movie, resource data of song, etc. The personal webpage service includes data of diary, data of photo, etc. Thus, the data of every service provided by the instant messaging system is classified into confidential data and non-confidential data according to the property of the service and the importance of the service data, and is identified by a confidential-or-not flag.<br>
Step S202: The non-confidential data of every service provided by the instant messaging system is obtained and processed after the first authentication performed in the instant messaging system is passed successfully.<br>
The display panel of the instant messaging system is configured with the identifier of various services, where the user may call a certain service by clicking the identifier of the service. The instant messaging system performs determination for each data of the service according to the confidential-or-not flag of the data of the service. If being determined as non-confidential data, the data is obtained and processed. If being determined as confidential data, the data is not obtained and processed.<br>
Step S203: The instant messaging system performs a second authentication when the user needs to access the confidential data, and the confidential data of the service is obtained and processed after the second authentication is passed successfully.<br>
When it is required to perform a relevant operation for the confidential data, the separate password conesponding to the service is obtained, and is comparecl with the preset separate password. If they are identical to each other, the second authentication is passed successfully and the confidential data of the service is obtained. If they are different from each other, prompt information used for indicating that the password is wrong is returned.<br><br>
Therefore, the non-confidential data .of every service of the instant messaging system is displayed for the user to perform processing after the first authentication is passed successfully. It is required to perform the second authentication only when the user needs to operate the confidential data of the service, and after the second authentication is passed successfully, the confidential data is displayed for the user to perform processing, thus ensuring the security requirements of the instant messaging system and facilitating the user to use the service of the instant messaging system easily and quickly.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, the email system linked by the instant messaging system is taken as an example to describe the data processing procedure in the case that the instant messaging system provides an email service. In the email service, the mail data newly received or having not been accessed typically needs to be processed by the user in time, contains a relatively small amount of data, and thus is not confidential. The data stored in the inbox or the draft box of the email system that has been accessed is the historical data stored by the user, which contains more information and typically is confidential. Thus, for the email system, the data can be classified into confidential data and non-confidential data according to whether the data has been accessed.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart illustrating the method for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The method includes steps as follows.<br>
Step S301: Whether the data of the email system linked by the instant messaging system has been accessed is determined.<br>
The data of the email system linked by the instant messaging system includes: data in inbox, data in outbox, data in draft box, other relevant data, etc. The inbox receives new mail. If the data of the received mail has been accessed, the accessed-or-not flag corresponding to the data is set. The instant messaging system determines whether the mail data has been accessed according to the accessed-or-not flag.<br>
Step S302: If the mail data has not been accessed, the mail data is classified as<br>
non-confidential data and the confideritial-or-not flag of the mail "data is reset;<br>
otherwise, the mail data is classified as' confidential data and the confidential-or-not<br>
flag of the mail data is set.	"^<br>
For example, if the data of the newly received mail has not been accessed, the accessed-or-not flag corresponding to the mail data is reset, the mail data is classified as non-confidential data, and the confidential-or-not flag of the mail data is reset. If the<br><br>
data of the received mail has been accessed, the accessed-or-nbt flag corresponding to the mail data is set, the mail data is classified as confidential data, and the confidential-or-not flag of the mail data is set.<br>
Step S303: When the email service is activated, the non-confidential data of email is obtained and displayed for the user to perform processing.<br>
The email identifier configured on the display panel of the instant messaging system is clicked, and the email system is activated. The instant messaging system performs determination for each data of the email system according to the confidential-or-not flag of the data. The data is obtained and processed if it is non-confidential data. The data is not obtained and processed if it is confidential data.<br>
The instant messaging system may choose to display the email system linked therewith in a completely displaying mode or an incompletely displaying mode. If the completely displaying mode is chosen, the identifier corresponding to the confidential data and the non-confidential data of the email system, as well as various application function identifiers, are obtained, and complete interface information of the email system is displayed, but the user cannot operate the identifier related to the confidential data before passing the second authentication. For example, in the case of the completely displaying mode, an inbox identifier, an outbox identifier, a draft box identifier, and a mail writing operation identifier and the like are displayed on the interface of the email system.<br>
If the incompletely displaying mode is chosen, only the identifier corresponding to the non-confidential data of the email system, as well as various application function identifiers, are obtained, and incomplete interface information of the email system is displayed. For example, in the .case of the incompletely displaying mode, only an unread mail identifier and a mail writing operation identifier and the like are displayed on the interface of the email system.<br>
Step S304: The confidential data of the email system is obtained and processed after the second authentication is passed successfully.<br>
If it is required to perform a relevant operation for the confidential data of the ernail system, the separate password corresponding to the email system is obtained, and is compared with the preset separate, password. If they are identical to each other, the^. second authentication is passed successfully, and the confidential data of the email ■• system is obtained and processed. Otherwise, prompt information used for indicating that the password is wrong is returned.<br>
In the case that the user chooses the completely displaying mode, after the second authentication is passed successfully, the identifier related to the confidential data can<br><br>
be operated. In the case that the user chooses the completely displaying mode, after the second authentication is passed successfully, the identifier corresponding to the confidential data is obtained and the complete mode of the email system is displayed.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, the data is classified into * confidential data and non-confidential data according to the accessed-or-not flag, and the data of the email system is configured with the confidential-or-not flag correspondingly. In the email system linked by the instant messaging system, new mail data that has not been read and is not confidential can be effectively classified as non-confidential data, the user can switch to the email system through the instant messaging system to operate the new mail, thus facilitating the user. The stored mail data that has been read and is confidential can be classified as confidential data, and the confidential data can only be operated after the second identity authentication is performed for the user, thus ensuring the security of the relevant data of the email system.<br>
In a third embodiment of the present invention, the network hard disk service linked by the instant messaging system is taken as an example to describe the data processing process that the instant messaging system provides a network hard disk service. The network hard disk service can be used to store various data, e.g. to store resource data of TV drama program, resource data of music and song, resource data of movie, etc. Because the resource of newly launched TV drama program, song, movie and the like attracts a large number of users, the visiting frequency thereof is quite high. Thus the resource data having a high visiting frequency can be set as confidential data, and the second authentication and the corresponding management is performed for the user intended to download such resource data. On the contrary, the resource of outdated TV drama program, song, movie and the like attracts fewer users, the downloading frequency is thus lower, and therefore such resource data can be set as non-confidential data and is provided for the user freely.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating the method for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The method includes steps as follows.<br>
Step S401: The frequency that each data of the network hard disk service pf the<br>
instant messaging system is accessed is calculated.	.   "<br>
To calculate the frequency that each data o^f the network hard disk service of the instant messaging system is accessed includes, for example, the frequency that each TV drama program is accessed, the frequency that each song is accessed, the frequency that each movie is accessed, etc.<br><br>
Step S402: If the frequency that it has been accessed exceeds a predetermined value, the data is classified as confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag of the data is set; otherwise, the data is classified as non-confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag of the data is reset.<br>
The frequency that each data in the network hard disk is accessed is compared with the predetermined value. If the frequency that it has been accessed exceeds the predetermined value, the data is classified as confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag of the data is set. If the frequency that it has been accessed is lower than the predetermined value, the data is classified as non-confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag of the data is reset. Specifically, the predetermined value may be 50 million times/day.<br>
Step S403: When the network hard disk service is activated, whether the data of the network hard disk service is confidential data is determined according to the confidential-or-not flag, go to Step S404 if it is confidential data, and go to Step S405 otherwise.<br>
For example, when wishing to download a newly launched movie, the user clicks the identifier of the movie, the system determines whether the data of the movie is confidential data, go to Step S404 if the data of the movie is confidential data, and go to Step S405 otherwise.<br>
Step S404: After the second authentication is passed successfully, the confidential data of the network hard disk service is obtained and processed.<br>
The separate password corresponding to the network hard disk is obtained, and is compared with the preset separate password. If they are identical to each other, the second authentication is passed successfully and the data of the movie that the user requires is obtained and processed. Otherwise, prompt information used for indicating that the password is wrong is returned.<br>
Step S405: The required data is directly obtained from the network hard disk so as to be processed.<br>
After the data of the movie that the user requires is determined as non-confidential data, the instant messaging sy^stem obtains the data of the movie that the user require? directly from the network hard disk service.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, by calculating the frequency that the data of the network hard disk service has been accessed, the instant messaging system effectively classifies the data in the network hard disk into confidential data and non-confidential data. The data of the network hard disk service that has been accessed in a low frequency is classified as non-confidential data, and is completely open to all<br>
10<br><br>
users, thus facilitating the user to download the data at any time. The data of network hard disk service that is new and has been accessed in a high frequency is classified as confidential data, and it is required to perform the second authentication for the user intended to download it, thus facilitating effectively managing the user downloading the confidential data. When the data of the network hard disk service is outdated, the frequency that it is accessed decreases, its utilization vajue also decreases, and there is no need to keep the data as confidential anymore, thus the instant messaging system classifies it as non-confidential data.<br>
In a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the personal webpage linked by the instant messaging system is taken as an example to describe the data processing process that the instant messaging system provides a personal webpage service. If the user uses the personal webpage linked by the instant messaging system to record personal information (such as personal diary, personal photo), the information newly added by the user typically is not confidential and can be open to another user. However, the stored historical record typically is confidential and it is required to perform an identity authentication for another accessing user. Thus, in the personal webpage, the data can be classified into confidential data and non-confidential data according to the time that it is generated, and the data of the personal webpage service is configured with the confidential-or-not flag correspondingly.<br>
Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating the method for classifying and processing data in an instant messaging system according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The method includes steps as follows.<br>
Step S501: The time that the data of the personal webpage service linked by the instant messaging system is generated is obtained.<br>
The time that the data of the personal webpage service is generated refers to the time that the data of the personal webpage service is stored into the personal webpage. For example, the time that the newly written diary is stored is May 12th, and the time that the other diary already contained in the database is stored is earlier than May 1st.<br>
Step S502: If the time that the data is generated is later than a predetermined time, the data is classified as non-confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag of the data is reset; otherwise, the data is classified as confidential data and the confidential-or-not flag is set.<br>
A reference time is set and the time that the data of the personal webpage service is generated is compared with the reference time having been set. If the time that it is generated is earlier than the time having been set, the data is classified as confidential data. If the time that it is generated is later than the time having been set, the data is<br>
11<br><br>
classified as non-confidential data.<br>
For example, the reference time having been set is the eighth day prior to the current time, where the current time is May 15th, thus the time having been set is May 7th. The time that the new diary is written is May 12th, which is later than the time having been set, thus the data of the diary is non-confidential data. The time that any of the diary stored in th'e database is generated is earlier than May 1st, hence is earlier than the time having been set, thus the data of the stored diary is confidential data.<br>
Step S503: When the personal webpage service is activated, the non-confidential data of the personal webpage is obtained and displayed," and provided for the user.<br>
The personal webpage identifier on the display panel of the instant messaging system is clicked, and the personal webpage service is activated. The instant messaging system determines whether the data of the personal webpage service is non-confidential data according to the confidential-or-not flag. If so, the data is obtained and processed. Otherwise, the data is not obtained and processed.<br>
The personal webpage service may choose to use a completely displaying mode and an incompletely displaying mode. When the completely displaying mode is chosen, the confidential data and the non-confidential data of the personal webpage service are obtained and displayed, where the personal webpage displays complete interface information. For example, the identifier of newly stored diary and the identifier of previously stored diary are displayed on the interface of the personal webpage, but other user(s) cannot perform the relevant operation for the identifier related to the confidential data.<br>
When the incompletely displaying mode is chosen, the non-confidential data of the personal webpage is obtained and displayed, where incomplete interface information of the personal webpage is displayed. For example, only the identifier of newly stored diary is displayed on the interface of the personal webpage.<br>
Step S504: After the second authentication is passed successfully, the confidential data of the personal webpage is obtained and displayed, and processed.<br>
When it is required to perform a relevant operation for the confidential data, the separate password corresponding to the personal webpage is obtained, and is compared with the preset separate password. If they are identical to each other, the second authentication is passed jiuccessfuUy and the confidential data of the personal webpage service is obtained. Otherwise, prompt information used for indicating that the password is wrong is returned.<br>
In the case that the user chooses the completely displaying mode, after the second authentication is passed successfully, the identifier related to the confidential data can<br>
12<br><br>
be processed. In the case that the user chooses the completely displaying mode, after the second authentication is passed successfully, the confidential data is obtained and processed and the complete mode of the personal webpage is displayed.<br>
In the fourth embodiment of the present invention, the data of the personal webpage service is classified into confidential data and non-confidentfal data according to the time that it is generated. Specifically, the newly stored "diary or the newly uploaded photo is determined as unimportant data, and there is no need to perform the second authentication when another user accesses the data, thus facilitating the user to read the personal webpage. It is required to perform the second authentication only when the user accesses the previously stored diary or photo of the personal webpage, thus ensuring the security of the data of the personal webpage service.<br>
Based on the above method for performing the second authentication in the instant messaging system, an embodiment of the present invention provides a system for performing the second authentication in the instant messaging system.
