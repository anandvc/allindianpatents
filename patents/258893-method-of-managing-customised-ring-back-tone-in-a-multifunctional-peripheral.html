				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP) systems and in particular, to facsimile machines. More particularly the invention relates to a method of customized ring back tone in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the present scenario, in order to dial for a FAX (facsimile) transmission, the ring back signal is generated by network and it is heard at the caller side until the receiver (fax machine at the other end) starts receiving the fax. This is a standard<br>
Ring Back Signal hearing which one cannot differentiate to which number one has<br>
*<br>
called.	4c<br>
The patent publication no. EP 1014653 A2 titled "graphical indication of called and calling parties" describes a network communication system wherein a graphical transmission is possible between the source and destination party networks. According to the patent publication, a digital representation of a sound waveform can also be transmitted via the above mentioned network communication system. Further, the patent publication mentions that such form of graphical or audio information transmission can be implemented for telephones, FAX machines etc. However, the publication mainly focuses on providing graphical information for a telephone having a digital display and does not elaborate the use of customized audio/tones for a FAX machine.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a Flow Chart depicting an MFP and CRBT (customized ring back tone).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed invention describes a method for having customized ring back signal in MFP instead of having the Ring Back Signal generated by the Network.<br>
The object of the proposed invention is to disclose a method of customized ring back tone in MFP, which is unique.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method of providing customized ring back tone in MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	setting the customized ring back tones by storing in a memory of the MFP and associating the said tones with particular numbers or group;<br>
(b)	playing the customized ring back tone associated with the number when a user dials a particular number or group from the MFP and on detection of a signal from the network; and<br>
(c)	managing the customized ring back tones.<br>
The setting up of customized ring back tones involves browsing the contact menus and selecting the contact name and associating the ring back tones stored in the MFP memory. The setting up of ring back tones involves browsing the contact menus and selecting the group name and associating the ring back tones stored in the MFP memory. Playing the customized ring back tone associated with a particular number or group involves fetching the ring back tone set against the number which is dialed from the number list. On detection of ring back tone from the network the MFP overrides the tone and play the customized ring back tone. Managing the customized ring back tones involves the addition and removal of the said customized ring back tones from the MFP. Playing the customized ring back tones involves variations of the assigned tone during faxing.<br>
The invention relates to a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP) system and in particular, to facsimile machines. The invention provides an MFP with a memory to store tones and to associate them with particular numbers or group. When a user dials a particular number or group from an MFP, the MFP on detecting a signal from the network plays the tone associated with that number. Moreover, the tone is played as long as the network signal for data transfer is detected. In one particular example, the MFP can be a facsimile machine and when a FAX is sent over to a particular number, the tone associated with that particular number is played as long as ring back signal is detected from the network. Also, when such an operation is being carried out for a group, different tones can be assigned for different recipients in the group.<br>
Accordingly the proposed invention relates to a method for enhancing the information conveyability during the FAX by having customized Ring Back Tones played in MFP. It also enhances the information conveyability by continuing to play variation of the assigned tone during actual faxing and during the Group FAX, wherein different tones are assigned to different numbers.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Referring to figure 1 the section Manage CRBT (Step 1) provides the necessary Ul through which the CRBT can be added or removed from the memory of MFP (step 2 ). Adding CRBT involves for example downloading CRBT to memory in MFP via USB or any standard interface (Step 3) .Removing CRBT involves deleting CRBT from memory of MFP (Step 4).<br>
The section Set CRBT provides the necessary Ul to select the CRBT assign it to the Contact. Step 1 and Step 2 of Set CRBT will allow the user to browse the available CRBT in the memory and associate with the contact name. Step 3 of Set CRBT will allow the user to browse the available CRBT in the memory and associate with the contact group.<br>
The section Play CRBT which requires the above two sections has been done in prior in order to play any CRBT, The Step 4 shows the start of a fax or fax over internet Protocol job. This can be either a single fax job or a group fax job. Group suggests that there are one or more numbers in queue for faxing. While Numbers(step 5) will retrieve the number one by one and FAX or FOIP is initiated. While dialing of number (step 6) is in progress in order to initiate a FAX corresponding CRBT if anything is set is retrieved from Memory from MFP (step 7). In the connection process normally the standard RBT is heard. If RBT is detected then instead of the RBT if any set CRBT is there it is played hence conveying information about which number is currently being tried for faxing as the user who has set the CRBT will know for which number he/ she has set the CRBT. (Step 8 of Fig 1). After the connection is received no RBT is received hence the CRBT is also stopped from playing, and continue with FAX protocol step 9 of Fig 1 in a loop in a similar fashion when ever the FAX job of a particular dumber is commenced a selected CRBT indicative of the Faxed number is played thus conveying more information to the user who initiates Group FAX or FAX.<br>
The invention provides a method for providing memory to store the customized tones in the MFP, assigning tones to a Particular Number or Group which is supported by MFP and detecting the Ring Back Signal generated by network and replacing it with the associated tone assigned for the called number or group for the time period the Ring Back signal is sent from network.<br>
The method proposed in the invention is relevant in various scenarios for example when the MFP, while sending a group fax where it sends the fax automatically in a queue to the pre-defined numbers and the total number of dialing to a particular number is also shown, if the called party is busy.<br>
As per the invention the MFP will play the associated tone, which gives more information conveying which user FAX is being done. Additionally when FAX is in progress the MFP can also continue playing variation of the same tone. For the person who configures even though MFP is a networked common machine he can know from the configured tone when which FAX job is processed.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
