				<td>Description<br>
Waste water lifting system<br>
The invention relates to a waste water lifting system<br>
comprising a collecting tank for liquids, in particular<br>
sewage, excrement or the like, and comprising a device<br>
for emptying the tank, in particular a pump which is<br>
connected to a motor and which is arranged as a motor<br>
pump unit wholly or partially lowered in the tank, the<br>
tank has at least one inlet and outlet pipe,<br>
respectively, for the liquids, and the waste water<br>
lifting system is provided with a device for switching<br>
the pump as a function of a liquid level within the<br>
tank.<br>
Waste water lifting systems of this kind are frequently<br>
used as excrement lifting systems and are employed in<br>
buildings and plants when waste water to be conveyed<br>
accrues beneath a so-called backwash level. The<br>
backwash level is usually a height level of an external<br>
waste water system, which is disposed outside a<br>
building under a road. For a proper operation of such a<br>
waste water lifting system, devices for monitoring the<br>
liquid level within the tank are necessary in order to<br>
be able to ensure that the pump is switched on and off<br>
on time.<br>
Through DE-A 33 11 980, such a waste water lifting<br>
system for the collection and pumping-off of sewage<br>
water is known. To this end, the waste water lifting<br>
system has a collecting tank and a motor pump unit<br>
located therein, which receives its switching signals<br>
through a pneumatic control bell. This is constituted<br>
by a Pitot tube, the air volume of which, when a tank<br>
content is raised, is enclosed and thus generates a<br><br>
static pressure in the Pitot tube. This pressure is<br>
registered by a pressure sensor and its value converted<br>
into a fill level height of the respective tank.<br>
However, such dynamic pressure systems, which exist in<br>
a wide variety of forms, are susceptible to the sewage<br>
water, and its constituent parts, present within the<br>
tank. Since a failure of a relevant component of this<br>
kind is of fundamental significance for the entire<br>
system and the building whose waste it disposes,<br>
considerable servicing and maintenance works are<br>
necessary to ensure the functionality thereof. In order<br>
to prevent leakages or deposits within such a Pitot<br>
tube system, the tube must constantly be cleared in a<br>
complex manner by separate control elements or the<br>
above drawbacks can be prevented by the introduction of<br>
air bubbles.<br>
Alternatively thereto, float switches, as are known,<br>
for example, through DE-A 3 43 0 527, have gained market<br>
acceptance for the controlling of the pump. In<br>
dependence on the liquid level within the tank, a<br>
float-actuated switch triggers the necessary switch-on<br>
and switch-off motions of a pump. These float switches<br>
also, however, are restricted or jeopardized in terms<br>
of their function by deposits or solid constituents in<br>
the liquid.<br>
The problem on which the invention is founded is<br>
therefore to develop a level registration system by<br>
which the fill level in the tank can be reliably<br>
registered without difficulty, and complex, additional<br>
protective devices exposed to the liquid can be<br>
dispensed with.<br>
The solution of the problem provides that the tank<br>
floor, or at least a part-area of the tank floor, is<br>
configured such that it is elastically resilient as a<br><br>
function of the tank fill level, that one or more<br>
sensors are disposed on the outer side of the<br>
elastically resilient tank floor area and measure the<br>
deformation thereof.<br>
With this solution, the problem of fill level sensors<br>
becoming contaminated is easily circumvented. Since the<br>
sensors which register the degree of deformation of a<br>
tank floor part are fitted on the outer side of the<br>
tank, they are fully removed from the harmful<br>
influences of the waste water. As a result of the<br>
arrangement of the tank floor part at a distance from<br>
an installation area for the waste water lifting<br>
system, a cavity is formed therebetween. This cavity is<br>
simultaneously a protective space for the external<br>
sensors against external mechanical influences and<br>
prevents damage to the elastically resilient tank floor<br>
part.<br>
The tank floor or a part-area thereof is designed such<br>
that at least one sensor is disposed at a tank floor<br>
measuring point at which an evaluable deformation<br>
occurs when the tank is maximally filled. Similarly, it<br>
is provided that at least one sensor is disposed at a<br>
tank floor measuring point at which an evaluable<br>
deformation occurs when the tank is minimally filled.<br>
The generation of sensor signals, with which the<br>
necessary switch-on, switch-off or alarm points of a<br>
waste water lifting system, or of the pump connected<br>
thereto, and the dependence on the respective fill<br>
level in the tank, can be reliably registered, is thus<br>
ensured. The deformation of load-imposing tank, which<br>
deformation here maximally occurs at a measuring point,<br>
lies within the respectively permitted material values.<br>
This is achieved by an appropriate shaping of the tank<br>
floor or of a part thereof.<br><br>
It is likewise possible to arrange an elastically<br>
resilient element in a leaktight and flexibly held<br>
manner in the tank floor and to connect it to at least<br>
one sensor. A sensor signal above a respective fill<br>
level is processed by the evaluation units (known per<br>
se) of such waste water lifting systems for a pump<br>
control system.<br>
According to another embodiment, one or more sensors<br>
are exchangeably fastened. This can be effected by<br>
means of simple snap-fastening or clamping connections<br>
and simplifies manufacture, whilst at the same time<br>
making a sensor easy to exchange in a possible service.<br>
An illustrative embodiment of the invention is<br>
represented in the drawings and is described in greater<br>
detail below, wherein<br>
fig. 1 shows an installation diagram for a<br>
waste water lifting system,<br>
fig. 2 shows a view of the waste water lifting<br>
system,<br>
fig. 3 &amp; 4 show views of sensor arrangements, and<br>
fig. 5 shows an enlarged representation of a<br>
floor.<br>
In fig. 1, a cross section through a building is shown,<br>
in the basement of which a sanitary device is<br>
represented. The sewage of the sanitary device and<br>
other liquids to be disposed of flow to a waste water<br>
lifting system 1 and are collected therein until a<br>
sufficiently high fill level for an ad hoc conveyance<br>
is reached. The waste water lifting system 1 comprises<br>
a liquid-tight and odor-tight tank 2 and a pump 3,<br><br>
disposed sealingly therein, in the form of a motor pump<br>
unit, which is designed for the smooth-running<br>
conveyance of such liquids. Via an inlet pipe 4,<br>
accrued waste water is led into the tank 2, and via an<br>
outlet pipe 5 in the form of a pressure line, is<br>
conveyed over a backwash level 6 in order to flow from<br>
there into a sewage system 7. In general, such a tank 2<br>
is provided with a ventilation (not represented here),<br>
whereby a gas evacuation is achieved and the creation<br>
of an overpressure in the tank 2 is prevented. Such a<br>
ventilation port is generally run over the roof of a<br>
building in order to prevent odors from causing a<br>
nuisance.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in enlarged representation a side view of<br>
such a waste water lifting system according to the<br>
prior art. The tank 2 which collects the sewage is<br>
hermetically sealed in order to prevent its escape and<br>
prevent odor nuisances within a building. The tank 2 is<br>
connected to an inlet line 4 and to an outlet line 5,<br>
in which latter a non-return valve 8 and a shut-off<br>
valve 9 are disposed. Partially immersed in the tank 2<br>
is an electrically driven pump 3. It pumps into the<br>
outlet pipe 5 and is only ever switched on when<br>
required. To this end, it is connected to a switching<br>
apparatus 10 for controlling and monitoring the<br>
operation of such a waste water lifting system.<br>
By way of example, a float switch 11 is shown in dashed<br>
representation as the prior art. Such a float switch<br>
disposed within the tank 2 is used to transmit a signal<br>
to the switching apparatus 10 when three tank fill<br>
levels PA, PE and A (shown in dash-dot representation)<br>
are reached, and from said switching apparatus a<br>
switching function for the waste water lifting system<br>
is triggered. The lowermost line PA here stands for the<br>
switching function "pump off". The pivotably mounted<br><br>
float switch then hangs down. As the liquid level<br>
increases, the float moves upwards until, at a tank<br>
fill level PE, it reaches a switching setting<br>
corresponding to the switching function "pump on" and<br>
causes the pump to be switched on by the switching<br>
apparatus 10. And when the uppermost, third tank fill<br>
level A is reached, a non-permitted operating state, an<br>
alarm function is triggered. If a greater quantity of<br>
waste water flows into the tank than can be pumped away<br>
by the pump, then the alarm function prevents the<br>
cellar rooms from being flooded by a backflow and<br>
prevents waste water from escaping from the inlets of<br>
the connected-up devices. This state can also arise in<br>
the event of a pump failure. Care should therefore be<br>
taken to ensure that such a float switch disposed<br>
within the tank is constantly ready for use.<br>
In contrast, fig. 3 shows as an improvement to the<br>
previous solutions an enlarged detail of the tank 2 in<br>
the form of a cross section through a tank floor 12.<br>
The floor 12 of the tank 2 has a part-region 12.1,<br>
which is disposed above and at a distance from an<br>
installation plane 13. As a result, between the<br>
installation plane 13 and the tank 2 resting thereon<br>
with the floor area 12, a wholly or partially closed-<br>
off cavity 16 is formed. This shields the resilient<br>
part-region 12.1 of the tank floor 12 from external<br>
influences. The part-region 12.1 of the tank floor 12<br>
is of elastically resilient configuration and on its<br>
outer side 14 there are disposed one or more sensors<br>
15. The distance between the sensor 15 mounted at the<br>
lowest point and the installation plane 13 is<br>
dimensioned such that, when a tank 2 is fully filled, a<br>
contact with the installation plane 13 is safely<br>
prevented.<br><br>
The respective degree of filling of a tank 2 acts, in<br>
the form of a column of liquid, deformingly upon the<br>
part-area 12.1 of elastically resilient configuration.<br>
The respective degree of deformation thereof is<br>
registered by at least one external sensor 15. Its<br>
signal is converted with the aid of the switching<br>
apparatus 10 into a fill level signal, is displayed<br>
and/or is used to control the pump 3.<br>
Due to a liquid level which is reached within the tank<br>
and due to the column of liquid resulting therefrom,<br>
the tank floor area is deformed or deflected<br>
differently. The orders of magnitude of these<br>
deformations lie within the permitted values of the<br>
material respectively used for the tank 2. The sensor<br>
15 is thus affected by deformation works, which are<br>
used as a direct measure of the fill level within the<br>
tank 2. Since the sensor 15 is disposed in a cavity 16,<br>
formed between the installation plane 13 and the, in<br>
relation thereto, raised floor part 12.1, an additional<br>
protective space for the sensor 15 is obtained. The<br>
signal lines (not represented here) of the sensor 15<br>
are likewise located completely outside the waste water<br>
lifting system and can therefore be connected without<br>
difficulty to the switching apparatus 10. The hitherto<br>
usual pipe bushings in the tank 2 are thus fully<br>
dispensed with. This constitutes an additional safety<br>
feature for a safe operation.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another embodiment of the floor area 12.<br>
Here, in the resilient tank floor part 12.1, a tank<br>
floor part 12.2 of elastically resilient configuration<br>
is additionally designed as a membrane inserted in a<br>
liquid-tight manner. This tank floor part 12.2 can<br>
consist of a rubber material, can be configured as<br>
plate consisting of an elastic plastics material, can<br>
be designed as a metallic membrane or as a combination<br><br>
of such materials. The respective liquid level in the<br>
tank 2 deflects the tank floor part 12.2 in the<br>
direction of the outer side 14. A sensor 15 disposed on<br>
the outer side 14 and operatively connected to the tank<br>
floor part 12.2 generates a sensor signal from the<br>
deflection.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the arrangement of the sensor 15 in an<br>
exchangeably designed housing 17, which with known<br>
means 18 can be fastened to the tank floor part 12.1.<br>
In the shown illustrative embodiment, it serves<br>
simultaneously to fasten the tank floor part 12.2. And<br>
the sensor 15 can be designed as an inductive system<br>
for a path measurement or as a piezoquartz for a<br>
pressure measurement.<br><br>
