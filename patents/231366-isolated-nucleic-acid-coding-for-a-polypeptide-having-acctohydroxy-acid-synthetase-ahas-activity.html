				<td>The present invention is directed to specific nucleic acids<br>
and polypeptides coded by these nucleic acids as well as<br>
their application. The polypeptides of the present<br>
invention serve to improve the production of branched-chain<br>
amino acids by fermentation.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides nucleotide<br>
sequences coding for acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS)<br>
mutants, the mutated enxymes themselves and a process for<br>
the fermentative production of branched-chain amino acids<br>
using these enzymes in specific hosts in which genes which<br>
code for the modified acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS)<br>
are expressed.<br>
It is known that amino acids may be produced by<br>
fermentation of strains of coryneform bacteria, in<br>
particular Corynebacterim glutamicum. Due to their great<br>
significance, efforts are constantly being made to improve<br>
the production process. Improvements to the process may<br>
relate to measures concerning fermentation technology, for<br>
example stirring and oxygen supply, or to the composition<br>
of the nutrient media, such as for example sugar<br>
concentration during fementation, or to working up of the<br>
product by, for example, ion exchange chromatography, or to<br>
the intrinsic performance characteristics of the micro-<br>
organism itself.<br>
The performance characteristics of these microorganisms are<br>
improved using methods of mutagenesis, selection and mutant<br>
selection. In this manner, strains are obtained which are<br>
resistant to antimetabolites, such as for example the<br>
isoleucine analogue isolencine hydroxyamate (Kisumi M,<br>
Komatsubara S, Sugiura, M Chibata I (1972) Journal of<br>
Bacteriology 110: 761-7 63 , the valine analogue 2-<br>
thiazolealanine (Tsuchida T, Yoshinanga F, Kubota K, Momose<br>
H (1975) Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, Japan 39:<br>
1319-1322) or the leucine analogue α-aminobutyrates (Ambe-<br><br>
Ono Y, Sato K, Totsuka I., Yoshihara Y, Nakamori S (1996)<br>
Bioscience Biotechnology Biochemistry 60: 1386-1387) or<br>
which are auxotrophic for regulatorily significant<br>
metabolites and produce e.g. branched-chain amino acids<br>
(Tsuchida T, Yoshinaga F, Kubota K, Momose H, Okumura S<br>
(1975) Agricultural and Biological Chemistry; Nakayama K,<br>
Kitada S, Kinoshita S 0 961) Journal of General and Applied<br>
Microbiology, Japan 7: 52-69; Nakayama K, Kitada S, Sato Z,<br>
Kinoshita (191) Journal of General and Applied<br>
Microbiology, Japan 7: 4 1-51)..<br>
For some years, the methods of recombinant DNA technology<br>
have also been used for strain improvement of strains of<br>
Corynebacterium which produce branched-chain amino acids by<br>
amplifying individual bi osynthesis genes for branched-chain<br>
amino acids and investigating the effect on their<br>
production. Review articles on this subject may be found<br>
inter alia in Kinoshita ("Glutamic Acid Bacteria", in:<br>
Biology of Industrial Microorganisms, Demain and Solomon<br>
(Eds.), Benjamin Cummings, London, UK, 1985, 115-142),<br>
Hilliger (BioTec 2, 40-44 (1991)), Eggeling (Amino Acids<br>
6:261-272 (1994)), Jetton and Sinskey (Critical Reviews in<br>
Biotechnology 15, 73-103 (1995)), Sahm et al. (Annuals of<br>
the New York Academy of Science 782, 25-39 (1996)), and<br>
Eggeling et al. , Journal, of Biotechnology 56: 168-180<br>
(1997)).<br>
Among others the branched-chain amino acids L-isoleucine,<br>
L-valine and L-leucine are used in pharmaceutical industry,<br>
in human medicine and in animal nutrition. One of the key<br>
enzymes of the synthesis of all three amino acids in<br>
bacteria is the acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS). It<br>
catalyses two reactions giving rise to precursors of the<br>
three amino acids.<br>
In valine and leucine baosynthesis pathway, the substrate<br>
for AHAS is pyruvate. AHAS catalyses the decarboxylation of<br>
pyruvate and its condensation with the second molecule of<br>
pyruvate to produce ace:olactate. In the isoleucine<br><br>
pathway, AHAS catalyses reaction of pyruvate and 2-<br>
ketobutyrate producing acetohydroxy butyrate. In<br>
Escherichia coli strains, as much as three AHAS isoenzymes<br>
exist. Activity of the isoenzymes is inhibited by<br>
combinations of amino acids, from which the inhibition by<br>
valine is the strongest (De Felice, M., Levinthal, M.,<br>
Iaccarino, M., GuardioLa, J., 1979. Growth inhibition as a<br>
consequence of antagonism between related amino acids:<br>
effect of valine in Escherichia coli K12. Microbiol Rev 43,<br>
4258) . AHAS I, coded by the genes ilvBN, is inhibited by<br>
valine and isoleucine, AHAS II, coded by ilvGM is valine<br>
resistant and AHAS III, coded by ilvIH is inhibited by<br>
valine and isoleucine. In all cases the enzyme consists of<br>
2 subunits. In AHAS I and AHAS III the small regulatory<br>
subunits coded by the genes ilvN and ilvH , respectively,<br>
are responsible for the inhibition.<br>
In contrast to E. coli, ilvBN codes for the only AHAS in C.<br>
glutamicum (Keilhauer, C, Eggeling, L., Sahm, H., 1993.<br>
Isoleucine synthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum:<br>
molecular analysis of the ilvB-ilvN-ilvC operon. J.<br>
Bacteriol. 175, 5595-5603). Activity of the C. glutamicum<br>
enzyme is inhibited by valine, leucine and isoleucine<br>
(Eggeling, I., Cordes, C, Eggeling, L., Sahm, H., 1987.<br>
Regulation of acetoh\droxy acid synthetase in<br>
Corynebacterium glutemicum during fermentation of alfa-<br>
ketobutyrate to L-isoleucine. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 25,<br>
346-351) . Expression of the gene cluster ilvBNC is also<br>
regulated by these three amino acids through the<br>
transcriptional attenuation (Morbach, S., Junger, C, Sahm,<br>
H., Eggeling, L. , 20)0. Attenuation control of ilvBNC in<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum; evidence of leader peptide<br>
formation without ths presence of a ribosome binding site.<br>
J Biosci Bioeng 90, 501-507).<br>
In Corynebacterium glutamicum no mutations deregulating the<br>
AHAS activity has been described on molecular level until<br>
now.<br><br>
The object of the present invention was to provide a<br>
modified acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS) . In particular<br>
the AHAS of the present invention shall be less prone to<br>
inhibition by amino acids just produced.<br>
This goal is meet according to the claims. Claim 1 is<br>
directed to specific nucleic acids which code for a<br>
polypeptide comprising envisaged features. Claim 2 embraces<br>
the polypeptides themseLves. Claim 3 and 4 disclose hosts<br>
comprising the nucleic acids of the invention or special<br>
primers or probes for their production via PCR. Moreover,<br>
claim 5 specifies a process for the production of further<br>
improved polypeptides of the inventions, whereas claim 6<br>
protects the thus produced polypeptides and nucleic acids,<br>
respectively. Claim 7 and 8 are directed to special uses<br>
and claim 9 embraces a process for the production of amino<br>
acids. Likewise claim 10 and 11 provide special vectors and<br>
micro-organisms.<br>
By providing isolated r.ucleic acid sequences coding for a<br>
polypeptide having acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS)<br>
activity selected from the group consisting of:<br>
a)	a nucleic acid sequence according to SEQ. ID No: 1<br>
or SEQ. ID NO: 3;<br>
b)	a nucleic acid sequence comprising in position<br>
21 and 22 a base traplet coding for Asp and Phe,<br>
respectively;<br>
c)	a nucleic acid sequence hybridising under stringent<br>
conditions with those of a) or b) ;<br>

polypeptide coded by a) or b) ;<br>
. f) a nucleic acid coding for a polypeptide with<br>

successive bases of the nucleic acid sequences of<br>

the obstacles presented above and known from the prior art<br>
have surprisingly been evercome in a notwithstandingly<br>
superior fashion. The nucleic acids of the invention encode<br>
polypeptides having a decreased amino acid feedback<br>
inhibition action compared to the wild type enzyme.<br>
The procedure to improve the nucleic acids according to the<br>
invention or the polypeptides coded by them using the<br>
methods of mutagenesis is sufficiently well-known to a<br>
person skilled in the art Suitable methods of mutagenesis<br>
are all the methods available for this purpose to a person<br>
skilled in the art. In particular these include saturation<br>
mutagenesis, random mutagenesis, in vitro recombination<br>
methods and site-directed mutagenesis (Eigen, M. and<br>
Gardiner, W., Evolutionary molecular engineering based on<br>
RNA replication, Pure Appl. Ch&amp;rt. 1984, 56, 967-978; Chen,<br>

Acad Sci USA 91, 1994, L0747-10751) .<br>
The new nucleic acid sequences obtained are cloned in a<br>
host organism using common methods cited below, and the<br>
polypeptides expressed :.n this way are detected and then<br>
isolated using suitable screening methods. For the purposes<br>
of detection, all the possible detection reactions for the<br>
molecules formed with this polypeptide are basically<br>
suitable. In particular, a photometric tests via the<br>
compounds formed (like e.g. acetolactate) or consumed, HPLC<br>
or GC methods can be used here to detect the amino acids<br>
formed. In addition, to detect new polypeptides modified by<br>
means of genetic engineering techniques, gel<br>
electrophoretic methods of detection or methods of<br>
detection using antibodies are also suitable.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention also covers nucleic acid<br>
sequences which hybridise under stringent conditions with<br>
the single-strand nucleic acid sequences according to the<br>
invention or single-straid nucleic acid sequences which are<br>
complementary thereto.<br>
The expression "under stringent conditions" is to be<br>
understood here in the seme way as is described in Sambrook<br>
et al. (Sambrook, J.; Fr:.tsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T.<br>
(1989), Molecular clonimg: a laboratory manual, 2nd ed.,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York). Stringent<br>
hybridisation in accordance with the present invention is<br>
preferably present when, after growing for one hour with 1 x<br>
SSC (150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0)<br>
and 0.1 % SDS (sodium dodecylsulfate) at 50°C, preferably at<br>
55 °C, more preferably at 62 °C and most preferably at 68 °C<br>
and more preferably for one hour with 0.2 x SSC and 0.1 %<br>
SDS at 50°C, preferably at 55 °C, more preferably at 62 °C<br>
and most preferably at 68 °C, a positive hybridisation<br>
signal is still observed.<br><br>
A second aspect of the present invention are polypeptides<br>
selected from the group consisting of<br>
a)	a polypeptide coded by a nucleic acid sequence<br>
according to Claim 1<br>
b)	a polypeptide having a sequence in accordance with<br>
SEQ .ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4;<br>
c)	a polypeptide which :.s at least 84 % homologous to<br>
a polypeptide with SHQ. ID NO: 2 or SEQ: ID NO. 4,<br>
without the activity and/or selectivity and/or<br>
stability of the polypeptide being substantially<br>
reduced as compared with the polypeptide with SEQ.<br>
ID NO: 2 or SEQ. ID M0: 4,<br>
which may serve as modified AHAS-enzymes in the bio-pathway<br>
in the production of branched--chain amino acids, in<br>
particular valine, leucine and isoleucine, by fermentation.<br>
Theses enzymes, as already mentioned, posses less feedback<br>
inhibition, hence, leading to the possibility to generate<br>
higher concentrations oi amino acids in the fermentation<br>
broth without having adverse inhibition effects.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention is concerned with<br>
plasmids, vectors, micro-organisms comprising one or more<br>
of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention.<br>
Suitable plasmids or vectors are in principle all<br>
embodiments which are available to a person skilled in the<br>
art for this purpose. These types of plasmids and vectors<br>
can be found e.g. in Studier et al. (Studier, W. F.;<br>
Rosenberg A. H.; Dunn J. J., Dubendroff J. W. ; , Use of the<br>
T7 RNA polymerase to direct expression of cloned genes,<br>
Methods Enzymol. 1990, 185, 61-89) or in company brochures<br>
issued by Novagen, Promega, New England Biolabs, Clontech<br>
or Gibco BRL. Other preferred plasmids and vectors can be<br>
found in: Glover, D. M. (1985), DNA cloning: a practical<br>
approach, Vol. I-III, IFL Press Ltd., Oxford; Rodriguez,<br>

heterologous gene expression, Methods Enzymol. 1990, 185,<br>
3-7; Sambrook, J.; Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989),<br>
Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd ed. , Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.<br>
Plasmids with which the gene constructs containing nucleic<br>
acids according to the invention can be cloned in a very<br>
preferred manner in the host organism are those of Fig. 1<br>
and Fig. 2.<br>
Likewise, the invention also provides microorganisms<br>
containing one or more o:l the nucleic acid sequences<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The micro-organism in wh:.ch the plasmids which contain the<br>
nucleic acid sequences according to the invention are<br>
cloned may be used to multiply and obtain a sufficient<br>
amount of the recombinant enzyme. The processes used for<br>
this purpose are well-known to a person skilled in the art<br>
(Sambrook, J.; Fritsch, :z. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989),<br>
Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd ed. , Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York). Micro-organisms<br>
which may be referred to are in principle all organisms<br>
known to a person skilled in the art which are suitable for<br>
this purpose such as e.g. yeasts such as Hansenula<br>
polymorpha, Pichia sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<br>
prokaryotes, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis or eukaryontes,<br>
such as mammal cells, insect cells. Strains of E. coli are<br>
preferably used for this purpose. The following are very<br>
particularly preferred: E. coli XLl Blue, NM 522, JM101,<br>
JM109, JM105, RRl, DH5a, TOP 10" or HB101. Plasmids with<br>
which the gene construct containing the nucleic acid<br>
according to the invention is preferably cloned, in the<br>
host organism are mentioned above.<br>
Preferred micro-organisms, provided by the present<br>
invention, may produce branched-chain amino acids from<br>
glucose, sucrose, lactose, mannose, fructose, maltose,<br>
molasses, starch, cellulose or from glycerol and ethanol.<br>
The micro-organisms may comprise representatives of the<br>
coryneform bacteria in particular of the genus<br><br>
Corynebacterium. Within the genus Corynebacterium,<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum may in particular be mentioned,<br>
which is known in specialist circles for its ability to<br>
produce enantiomerically enriched amino acids, preferably<br>
L-amino acids.<br>
Suitable strains of the genus Corynebacterium, in<br>
particular of the species Corynebacterium glutamicum, are<br>
in particular the known wild type strains<br>
Corynebacteriim glutamicum ATCC13032<br>
Brevibacteriun flavum ATCC14067<br>
Brevibacteriun lactofermentum ATCC13869 and<br>
Brevibacteriun divaricatum ATCC1402 0<br>
and branched-chain amino acid producing mutants or strains<br>
produced therefrom,<br>
such as for example the isoleucine producing strains<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC143 09<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC14310<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC14311<br>
CoryneJbacteriun glutamicum ATCC15168<br>
Corynebacterium ammo.niagenes ATCC 6871,<br>
such as for example the leucine producing strains<br>
Corynebacteriim glutamicum ATCC 21885<br>
Brevibacteriun flavum ATCC 21889<br>
or such as for example the valine producing strains<br>
Corynebacteriim glutamicum DSM 12455<br>
Corynebacteriim glutamicum FERM-P 9325<br>
Brevibacteriun lactofermentum FERM-P 9324<br>
Brevibacteriun lactofermentum FERM-BP 1763.<br>
The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be<br>
overexpressed in a suitable host. Overexpression may be<br>
achieved by increasing the copy number of the corresponding<br>
genes or by mutating the promoter and regulation region or<br>
the ribosome-binding site located upstream from the<br>
structural gene. Expression cassettes incorporated upstream<br><br>
from the structural gens act in the same manner. It is<br>
additionally possible to increase expression during the<br>
fermentative production of branched-chain amino acids by<br>
inducible promoters. Expression is also improved by<br>
measures to extend the lifetime of the mRNA. Enzyme<br>
activity is moreover amplified by preventing degradation of<br>
the enzyme protein. The: genes or gene constructs may either<br>
be present in plasmids in a variable copy number or be<br>
integrated in the chronosome and amplified. Alternatively,<br>
overexpression of the genes concerned may also be achieved<br>
by modifying the composition of the nutrient media and<br>
culture conditions. For further guidance in this instance<br>
it is referred to US09/471803 or its equivalent DE19951708. .<br>
Primers for preparing - by means of PCR - or hybridisation<br>
probes for detecting the nucleic acid sequences of the<br>
invention are a next topic of the present invention.<br>
Nucleic acid sequences accoarding to the invention are<br>
suitable as hybridisation probes for RNA, cDNA and DNA in<br>
order to isolate full length cDNA which code for AHAS<br>
proteins and to isolate such cDNA or genes, the sequence of .<br>
which exhibits a high level of similarity with that of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Nucleic acid sequences according to the invention are<br>
furthermore suitable as primers, with the assistance of<br>
which, using all types of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ,<br>
DNA of genes which cede for AHAS proteins may be generated.<br>
Sense and antisense primers coding for the corresponding<br>
amino acid sequences, or complementary DNA sequences, are<br>
included. Suitable primers may be obtained in principle by<br>
processes known to a person skilled in the art. Designing<br>
the primers according to the invention is performed by<br>
comparison with known DNA sequences or by translating the<br>
amino acid sequences detected by eye in the preferred codon<br>
of the organism under consideration (e.g. for Streptomyces:<br>
Wright F. and Bibb K. J. (1992), Codon usage in the G+C-<br>
rich Streptomyces genome, Gene 113, 55-65). Common features<br><br>
in the amino acid sequence of proteins from so-called<br>
superfamilies are also of use in this regard (Firestine, S.<br>
M. ; Nixon, A. E.; Benkovic, S. J. (1996), Threading your<br>

Such nucleic acid sequences acting as probes or primers<br>
have at least 30, preferably at least 20, very particularly<br>
preferably at least 15 successive nucleic acids in common<br>
with those of the invention. Nucleic acid sequences having<br>
a length of at least 40 or 50 base pairs are also suitable.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is directed<br>
to a process for preparing improved rec-polypeptides with<br>
acetohydroxy acid syn thetase (AHAS) activity starting from<br>
nucleic acid sequences in accordance with the invention,<br>
characterised in that<br>
a)	the nucleic acid sequences are subjected to mutagenesis,<br>
b)	the nucleic acid sequences obtainable from a) are cloned<br>
in a suitable vector and these are transferred into a<br>
suitable expression system and<br>
c)	the polypeptides with improved activity and/or<br>
selectivity and/or stability which are formed are detected<br>
and isolated.<br>
The invention also provides rec-polypeptides or nucleic<br>
acid sequences coding for these which are obtainable by a<br><br>
process like the one just described.<br>
Preparation of the nucl =ic acid sequences required to<br>
produce the improved rec-polypeptides and their expression<br>
in hosts is described supra and accordingly applies here.<br>
The polypeptides and improved rec-polypeptides according to<br>
the invention are preferably used to prepare enantiomer-<br>
enriched branched-chain amino acids, more preferably<br>
valine, leucine and iscleucine.<br>
In addition the nucleic acid sequences and improved nucleic<br>
acid sequences may pref erentially be used to prepare an<br>
branched-chain amino acid producing micro-organism.<br>
A next development of the invention reflects a process for<br>
the production of branched-chain amino acids with utilises<br>
a polypeptide of the invention.<br>
Moreover vectors pECKA (Fig. 1) or pECKA/ilvBNC (Fig. 2)<br>
are embraced by present invention. Furthermore modified<br>
micro-organisms like D!5M15652, DSM15561 or DSM15650 are<br>
enclosed in present invention. They were deposited at the<br>
Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen<br>
GmbH, Mascheroder Weg Lb, D-38124 Braunschweig, according<br>
to the Budapest Treaty on June 04, 2003.<br>
For cloning of the ilvSNC operon containing the mutations<br>
in the ilvN gene, the shuttle vector Escherichia coli -<br>
Corynebacterium glutamicum was constructed. First<br>
recognition site for the restriction enzyme Bglll was<br>
removed from the vector pK19. Then, HindiII/Hindi! fragment<br>
(2.7 kb) of the plasmid pBLl from Brevibacterium<br>
lactofermentum was cloned into Nhel site of pKl9. The<br>
resulting plasmid vector pECKA (5.4 kb) replicates in<br>
Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum, provides 7<br>
unique cloning sites, kanamycin resistance marker and a-<br>
complementation of (B-galactosidase for cloning in E. coli.<br>
The Chromosomal fragment Ssp::/EcoRl (5.7 kb) (with<br>
Sspl+BamH.1 ends) carrying the ilvBNC operon was cloned into<br><br>
the HindII+BamHI-digested vector pECKA to create<br>
pECKAilvBNC (11.1 kb) .<br>
The natural Scal/Bglll fragment of ilvBNC operon (77 0 bp)<br>
was exchanged with the same fragment containing 3 to 5 base<br>
alterations constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The<br>
target for site-directed mutagenesis was the conserved<br>
domain of the regulatory subunit coded by ilvN near the N<br>
terminus. Mutations were designed by PCR according to the<br>
sequences of the Escherichia coli and Streptomyces<br>
cinnamonensis AHAS mutants. Mutations were detected by<br>
sequencing.<br>
Plasmid DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli and the<br>
strain CoryneJbacterium glutamicum ATCC13032AilvN was<br>
transformed with the plismids pECKAilvB2NC(WT) ,<br>
pECKAilv.BNC(M8) and pECKAilvBNC(Ml3) . The decrease of<br>
inhibition of AHAS by branched-chain amino acids was<br>
demonstrated.<br>
"Isolated" means separated from its natural environment.<br>
Optically enriched (enantiomerically enriched, enantiomer<br>
enriched) compounds in the context of this invention is<br>
understood to mean the presence of &gt;50 mol% of one optical<br>
antipode mixed with the other,<br>
The expression nucleic acid sequences is intended to<br>
include all types of single-strand or double-strand DNA and<br>
also RNA or mixtures OF the same.<br>
An improvement in activity and/or selectivity and/or<br>
stability means, according to the invention, that the<br>
polypeptides are more active and/or more selective and are<br>
more stable under the reaction conditions used. Whereas the<br>
activity and stability of enzymes for industrial<br>
application should natxrally be as high as possible, with<br>
regard to the selectivity an improvement is referred to<br>
either when either the substrate selectivity decreases or<br>
the enantioselectivity of the enzymes increases. For the<br><br>
expression not substantially reduced, used in this<br>
connection, the same definition applies mutatis mutandis.<br>
The claimed protein sequences and nucleic acid sequences<br>
also include, according 1:0 the invention, those sequences<br>
which have a homology (excluding natural degeneration) of<br>
greater than 91 %, preferably greater than 92 %, 93 % or<br>
94 %, more preferably greater than 95 % or 96 % and<br>
particularly preferably creater than 97 %, 98 % or 99 % to<br>
one of these sequences, provided the mode of action or<br>
purpose of such a sequence is retained. The expression<br>
"homology" (or identity) as used herein can be defined by<br>
the equation H (%) = [1 - V7X] x 100, where H means<br>
homology, X is the total number of nucleobases/amino acids<br>
in the comparison sequence and V is the number of different<br>
nucleobases /amino acids in the sequence being considered<br>
with reference to the comparison sequence. In each case the<br>
expression nucleic acid s aquences which code for<br>
polypeptides includes all sequences which appear to be<br>
possible, in accordance w.Lth degeneration of the genetic<br>
code.<br>

1.	Construction of the pLasmid vector pECKA<br>
For cloning of the C. glatamicvm ilvBNC operon containing<br>
the mutations in the ilv.N gene and for its overexpression,<br>
the shuttle vector repliCating in Escherichia coli and<br>
CoryneJbacterium glutamic mi was constructed. First,<br>
recognition site for the restriction enzyme Bglll was<br>
removed from the vector pK19 (Pridmore, R. D. , 1987. New<br>
and versatile cloning vectors with kanamycin-resistance<br>
marker. Gene 56, 309-312'. The plasmid pKl9 was digested by<br>
BglII, blunt-ended by Klenow enzyme and religated. After<br>
ligation, E. coli DH5a cells were transformed, with the<br>
ligation mixture and transformants containing the resulting<br>
plasmid pK19B were selected on agar plates containing<br>
kanamycin (20 mg/1) . The removal of the Bglll site in pK19B<br>
was confirmed by the treatment of the isolated plasmid<br>
molecule with Bglll. (Th.s removal has permitted later<br>
subcloning of the fragment carrying the ilvN gene into the<br>
newly constructed vector pECKA.) Then, HindIII /HindII<br>
fragment (2.7 kb) of the plasmid pBLl from Brevibacterium<br>
lactofermentum blunt-ended by the Klenow enzyme was cloned<br>
into, the blunt-ended NheI. site of pK19B. The resulting<br>
plasmid vector pECKA (5.4 kb) replicates in Escherichia<br>
coli and CoryneJbacterium glutamicum, provides 7 unique<br>
cloning sites (HindII, SaII, BamHI, SmaI, AvaI, KpnI, SacI)<br>
kanamycin resistance marker and a-complementation of B<br>
galactosidase for cloning in E. coli. Its restriction and<br>
genetic map is shown in rig. 1.<br>
2.	Cloning of the ilvBNC operon into the vector pECKA<br>
The 5.7-kb fragment of C glutamicum chromosome carrying<br>
the ilvBNC operon was obtained by digestion of the plasmid<br>
pKK5 (Keilhauer, C, Egguling, L. Sahm, H., 1993.<br>
Isoleucine synthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum:<br>
molecular analysis of the ilvB-ilvN-ilvC operon. J.<br><br>
Bacteriol. 17 5, 5595-560 3) with the restriction enzymes<br>
Sspl and BamHI. The fragment was ligated with the<br>
HindiI+BamHI-digested vector pECKA and the ligation mixture<br>
was used for transformation of E. coli DH5α. The<br>
transformants were selected on the agar plates containing<br>
kanamycin (30 rug/1) . The structure of the resulting plasmid<br>
pECKAilvBNC (11.1 kb) was confirmed by restriction<br>
analysis. The restriction and genetic map of the plasmid<br>
pECKAilvBNC is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
3. Design of the oligonucleotide primer for mutagenesis of<br>
the ilvN gene<br>
The known amino acid sequence of the regulatory subunit of<br>
AHAS coded by the C. glutamicum ilvN gene (GenBank<br>
accession number L09232) was aligned with the known amino<br>
acid sequences of regulatory subunits of AHAS from<br>
Streptomyces cinnamonens.is (GenBank accession number<br>
AF175526) and from Escherichia coli (GenBank accession<br>
number AE016769, section 15 of the complete genome).<br>
Several mutations of Escherichia coli a.nd Streptomyces<br>
cinnamonensis conferring resistance to valine were<br>
described (Vyazraensky, M , Sella, C, Barak, Z., Chipman,<br>
D. M. , 1996. Isolation and characterization of subunits of<br>
acetohydroxy acid synthase isozyme III and reconstitution<br>
of the holoenzyme. Biochemistry 35, 10339-10346; Kopecky,<br>
J., Janata, J., Pospisil S., Felsberg, J., Spizek, J.,<br>
1999. Mutations in two d:.stinct regions of acetolactate<br>
synthase regulatory subunit from Streptomyces cinnamonensis<br>
result in the lack of sensitivity to end-product<br>
inhibition. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 266, 162-166).In<br>
some strains displaying this phenotype, a mutation changing<br>
amino acid glycine to aspartate at position 20 (in E. coli<br>
sequence numbering) was ::ound in both E. coli and S.<br>
cinnamonensis at the partially conserved domain near the N-<br>
terminus of the protein:<br><br>

We have designed a degenerated oligonucleotide primer<br>
ILVNM1 (SEQ. ID NO: 7) for site-directed mutagenesis of the<br>
ilvN gene of C. glutamicum. Thii3 primer may introduce<br>
mutations into the ilvN gene at the positions of the<br>
nucleotide triplets corresponding to the amino acids<br>
glycine, isoleucine and asoleucine at positions 20 to 22 in<br>

The nucleotides altered, comparing to the sequence of the<br>
wild type, are shown in bold face. There are two<br>
degenerated positions, w:.thin triplets 20 and 22 (G or A<br>
and A or T, respectively].<br>
4. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ilvN gene<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis of the natural Scal/Bglll<br>
fragment of C. glutamicun ilvBNC operon (770 bp) was<br>
performed using PCR reactions and 4 oligonucleotide primers<br>
(Ito, W., Ishiguro, H., Kurosawa, Y., 1991. A general<br>
method for introducing a series of mutations into cloned<br>
DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. Gene 102, 67-70).<br><br>
The primers used:<br>
MILVNH 5'GCGGAGGAAGTACTGCC 3'	(SEQ.	ID NO:	6)<br>
MILVND 5'CAATCAGATTAATTGCTGTTTA 3'	(SEQ.	ID NO:	7)<br>
ILVM1 5'GGACGTAGACGGTGACTTTCCCGCG	3' (SEQ.	ID NO:	8)<br>
A T<br>
MISBGL 5'GTTTAGAACTTGGCCCGAG 3'	(SEQ.	ID NO:	9)<br>
First PCR: Using the primers MILVNH and MISBGL the<br>
fragment A (786 bp) with altered natural Bglll site was<br>
amplified. Using the primers ILVMl and MILVND the fragment<br>
B (491 bp) with mutations within ilvN gene was amplified.<br>
As a template, the plasmd pECKAilvBNC was used. The<br>
resulting DNA fragments were separated in the agarose gel,<br>
isolated and purified by precipitation.<br>
Second PCR: Using primers MILVNH - MILVND and template,<br>
fragments A + B (mixed in a molar ratio 1:1), a mixture of<br>
fragment C (803 bp) with mutation in Bglll site and<br>
fragment D (803 bp) with mutations in the ilvN gene were<br>
amplified. This mixture was digested by SeaI and BglII and<br>
the resulting fragments were isolated from the agarose gel.<br>
The plasmid pECKAi1VBNC was digested by the same enzymes<br>
providing fragments of 766 bp and 10334 bp and the larger<br>
fragment was also isolated from the gel. The isolated<br>
fragments were mixed and ligated. The cells of E. coli<br>
DH5oc were transformed by the ligation mixture and<br>
transformants were selected on the plates with kanamycin<br>
(30 mg/1). In this way, a natural Seal/BelII chromosomal<br>
fragment (766 bp) in the plasmid pECKAilvBNC was exchanged<br>
for the same fragment in which ilvN can contain 3 to 5<br>
altered nucleotides.<br><br>
5.	Sequencing of the inutants of ilvN<br>
Plasmid DNA from the obtained E. coli DH5α clones was<br>
isolated and sequenced using the primer SILVNH and<br>
automatic sequencer Vistra (Amersham).<br>
Primer SILVNH:<br>
5' GATCCTGCCGACATTCACC-A 3' (SEQ. ID NO: 9)<br>
Clones with 2 differer.t sequences within the triplets 20 to<br>
22 were isolated:<br><br>
The complete ilvN sequences of the mutants M8 and M13 are<br>
shown in Seq. 3 and 1, respectively..<br>
6.	Transformation of Corynehacterium glutamicum<br>
Plasmid DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli and the<br>
strain Corynehacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 ilvN was<br>
transformed with the plasmids pECKAilvBNC(WT),<br>
pECKAilvBNC(M8) and pECKAilvfiiVC(Ml3) using the<br>
electroporation methcd (Liebl, W. , Bayerl, A., Schein, B.,<br>
Stillner, U., Schleifer, K. H., 1989. High efficiency<br>
electroporation of irtact Corynebacterium glutamicum cells.<br>
FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 53, 299-303). Transformants were<br>
selected on the plates with kanamycin (30 mg/1).<br><br>
7. Measurements of the AHAS activity and of its inhibition<br>
by valine, leucine and isoleucine<br>
Strains C. glutamicum ATCC13032 kilvN carrying the plasmids<br>
pECKAi 1 vBNC(WT) , pECKAi 11VBNC(M8) and pECKAi1vBNC(Ml3 ) were<br>
used for measuring the activity of AHAS. The cells were<br>
cultivated in the minima]. medium CGXII overnight, harvested<br>
by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication. After<br>
centrifugation (16000xg, 30 min AHAS activity was measured<br>
in the cell-free extract. The spectrophotometric enzyme<br>
assay detects indirectly the reaction product acetolactate<br>
(Singh, B. K., Stidham, M. A., Shaner, D. L. , 1988. Assay<br>
of acetohydroxyacid synthase. Anal Biochem 171, 173-179) .<br>
The assay involves the conversion of the end product<br>
acetolactate to acetoin end the detection of acetoin via<br>
the formation of a creatine and naphthol complex.<br>
The results of the enzyme activity measurements are shown<br>
in table 1. To test the inhibition of the enzyme by valine,<br>
leucine and isoleucine, the three amino acids (lOmM) were<br>
separately added into the reaction mixture. The results are<br>
shown in table 2 and table 3, respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
