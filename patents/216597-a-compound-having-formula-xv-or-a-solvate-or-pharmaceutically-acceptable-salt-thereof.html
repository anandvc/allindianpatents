COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND HAVING FORMULA (XV), OR A SOLVATE OR PHARMACEUTICALLY ACCEPTABLE SALT THEREOF"<br>
CARDIOME PHARMA CORP., [formerly known as NORTRAN PHARMACEUTICALS INC.,], of 6190 Agronomy Road, 6th Floor, Vancouver, British Colurribia V6T 1Z3, Canada,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
TFCHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present  invention  is generally directed  toward  aminocyclohexyl ether     compounds,     pharmaceutical     compositions     and     kits     containing     tiic 5     aminocyclohexyl ether compounds, and therapeutic uses thereof<br>
BACK GRUUND Of  THE  INVENTION<br>
Arrhythmia is a variation from the normal rhythm of the heart beat and generally represents the end product of abnormal ion-channel structure, number or function    Both atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias are known.   The major<br>
10 cause of fatalities due to cardiac arrhythmias is the subtype of ventricular arrhythmias known as ventricular fibrillation (VF) Conservative estimates indicate that, in the U.S. alone, each year over one million Americans will have a new or recurrent coronary attack (defined as myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease) About 650,000 will be first heart attacks and 450,000 will be recantent attacks     About one<br>
15 third of the people experiencing these attacks will die of them. At least 250,000 people a year die of coronary heart disease with 1 hour of the onset of symptoms and before they reach a hospital. These are sudden deaths caused by cardiac arrest, usually resulting from ventricular fibrillation<br>
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen in clinical<br>
20 practice and is a cause of morbidity in many individuals (Pntchett F.L., .V Engl. J Med. 527(14): 1031 Oct. 1, 1992, discussion 1031-2; Kannel and Wolf, Am. Heart J. 12?( I \:1M 7 Jan. 1942) lis prevalence ts likely to increase as the population ages and it is estimated that 3-5% of patients over the age of 60 years have AF (Kannel W.B.. Abbot R.D . Savage D.D., McNamara P.M., ,V. Engl. J. Med 306( 1 7)-1018-22. 1982,<br>
25 Wolf FA., Abbot R.D., Kannel W.B. Stroke. 22(8):983-8, 1991). While AF is rarely fatal, it can impair cardiac function and is a major cause of stroke (Hinton R.C., Kistler J.P., Fallon J.T., Fnedhch A.L., Fisher CM., American Journal nf Cardiology 40(4):509-13,   1977;   Wolf P.A.,  Abbot  R.D.,  Kannel   W.B.,  Archives  of Internal<br><br>
Medicine 147(0):|561 4. 19S7; Wolf PA . Abbot R.I)., Kannel W.B. Stroke. 22(8)981-8, 1991; Cabin U.S.. Clubb K.S., Hall C.. Perlmutter R.A., Femstcin A.R.. American Journal of ('ardiologv 65( 16): 1112-6, 1990 i<br>
Antiarrhythmic agents have been developed to prevent or alleviate 5 cardiac arrhythmia. For example. Class 1 antiarrhythmic compounds have been used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment of ventricular arrhythmia is very- important since such an arrhythmia can be fatal. Serious ventricular arrhyilmuas (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) occur most often in the presence of myocardial ischemia and/or infarction Ventricular fibrillation often occurs 10 in the setting ol~ acute myocardial ischemia, before infarction fully develops. At present, there is no satisfactory pharmacotherapy for the treatment and/or prevention of ventricular fibrillation during acute ischemia. In fact, many Class I antiarrhythmic compounds may actually increase mortality in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.<br>
15	Class la, Ic and III antiarrhythmic drugs have been used to convert recent<br>
onset Ai to sinus rhyilun and prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia (Fuch and Podrid, 1992; Nattel S . Hadjis T., Talajic M., Drugs 48(3):345-7l, 1994). However, drug therapy is often limited by adverse effects, including the possibility of increased mortality,  and   inadequate  efficacy  (Fold  O.K.,  Circulation   83(6):2248-50,   1990,<br>
20 Conlen SE' , Amman EM., Berlin J.A , Hewitt P.. Chalmers DC . Circulation 1991; 83(2):7|4 and Circulation 82(4): I 106-16, 1990; Flaker G.C , Blackshcar J.L., McBride R., Kronmal R.A., Halpenn J.L., Hart R.G , Journal of the American College of Cardiology 20(3):527-'i2, 1992; CAST, ,Y Engl. J. Med. 321:406. 1989; Nattel S.. Cardiovascular   Research    37(3)567-77.    1998.      Conversion   rates   for   Class   I<br>
25 antiarrhythmics range between 50-90% (Nattel S., Hadjis f, Talajic M , Drugs 4.(3):345-71, 1994; Steinbeck G., Rcmp T., Hoffmann F.., Journal of Cardiovascular Elecirophysiology. 9(8 Suppl):S104-8, 1998). Class III antiarrhythmics appear to be more effective for terminating atrial flutter than for AF and are generally regarded as less effective than Class I drugs for terminating of AF (Nattel S., Hadjis T., Talajic M.,<br>
30    Drugs. 48(3):345-71, 1994; Capucci A., Aschieri D., Villani G.Q., Drugs &amp; Aging<br><br>
3(7)5 1-70. l998l examples of such drugs include ibutilidc. dofetilide and sotalol. Conversion rates for these drugs range between 30-50% for recent onset AF (Capucci A. Aschien D. Villani G.Q., Drills &amp; Aging I3(/):51-70. 1998), and they are also associated with a risk of the induction of Torsades do Pouites ventricular tachyarrhythmias. For ibutilidc, the risk of ventricular proarrhythniia is estimated at -4.4%. with 17% of patients requiring cardioversion for refractory ventricular arrhythmias (Kowey PR., Vanderl ugt J.T., Ludcrcr JR. American Journal of Cardrolog   I:4O-52, 1996). Such events are particularly tragic in the case of Al-as this arrhythmia is rarely a fatal in and of itself.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art to identify new antiarrhythmic treatments, for both ventricular arrhythmias as well as for atrial arrhythmias. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides other related advantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As noted above, the present invention is directed to aminocyclohexyl ether compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing the aminocyclohexyl ether compounds, and various uses for the compound and compositions. Such uses include blockage of ion channels in vitro or in vivo, the treatment of arrhythmias, the production of anesthesia, and other uses as described herein.   An understanding of the present<br><br>
invention may be aided by reference to the following definitions and explanation of conventions used herein.<br>
Definitions and Conventions<br>
The aminocyclohexyl ether compounds of the invention have an eUier 5    oxygen atom at position \  of a cyclohexane ring, and an amine nitrogen atom at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring, with other positions numbered in corresponding order as shown below in structure (A):<br><br>
10	The bonds from the cyclohexane ring to the 1-oxygen and 2-nitrogen<br>
atoms in the above formula may be relatively disposed in either a cis or trans relationship. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the stereochemistry of the amine and ether substituents of the cyclohexane ring is either (R,R)-trans or (S,S)-trans.  In another preferred embodiment the stereochemistry is either (R,S)-c/s or<br>
15    (S,R)-m.<br>
In the formulae depicted herein, a bond to a substituent and/or a bond<br>
that links a molecular fragment to the remainder of a compound may be shown as<br>
intersecting one or more bonds in a ring structure. This indicates that the bond may be<br>
 attached to any one of the atoms that constitutes the ring structure, so long as a<br>
20 hydrogen atom could otherwise be present at that atom. Where no particular substituent(s) is identified for a particular position in a structure, then hydrogen(s) is present at that position. For example, compounds of the invention containing the A-X-CH(R5)- group where A equals formula (III)<br><br><br>
are intended to encompass compounds having the group (B):<br><br><br><br>
(B)<br>
where the group (B) is intended to encompass groups wherein any ring atom that could otherwise be substituted with hydrogen, may instead be substituted with either R7, R8 or R9, with the proviso that each of R7 R8 and R9 appears once and only once on the ring.<br>
10 Ring atoms that are not substituted with any of R7 R8 or R9 are substituted with hydrogen. In those instances where the invention specifies that a non-aromatic ring is substituted with more than one R group, and those R groups are shown connected to the non-aromatic ring with bonds that bisect ring bonds, then the R groups may be present at different atoms of the ring, or on the same atom of the ring, so long as that atom<br>
15    could otherwise be substituted with a hydrogen atom.<br>
Likewise,  where the  invention  specifies compounds containing the A-X-CH(R5)- group where A equals the aryl group (VI)<br><br>
20<br>
the invention is intended to encompass compounds wherein -X-CH(R5)- is joined through X to the aryl group (VI) at any atom which forms the aryl group (VI) so long as that atom of group (VI) could otherwise be substituted with a hydrogen atom. Thus, there are seven positions (identified with the letters "a" through "g") in structure (VI)<br>
25    where the -X-CH(R.)- group could be attached, and it is attached at one of those seven<br><br>
positions.    The  R12 group would occupy one and only one of the remaining six<br>
positions, and hydrogen atoms would be present in each of the five remaining positions.<br>
It is to be understood that when Z represents a divalent atom, e.g., oxygen or sulfur,<br>
then Z cannot be directly bonded to -X-CH(R5)-.<br>
5	When the invention specifies the location of an asymmetric divalent<br>
radical, then that divalent radical may be positioned in any possible manner that provides a stable chemical structure. For example, for compounds containing the A-X-CH(R5)- group where X is C(RI4,R6)-Y-, the invention provides compounds having both the A-C(R14,R6)-Y-CH(R5)- and A-Y-C(R14,R6)-CH(R5)- groups.<br>
!0	A wavy bond from a substituent to the central cyclohexane ring indicates<br>
that that group may be located on either side of the plane of the central ring.<br>

Outline of Method of Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
The aminocyclohexyl ether compounds of the present invention contain amino and ether sidechains disposed in a 1,2 arrangement on a cyclohexane ring. Accordingly, the amino and ether sidechains may be disposed in either a cis or trans 5 relationship, relative to one another and the plane of the cyclohexane ring. The present invention provides synthetic methodology whereby cis or trans compounds may be prepared.<br>
Trans compounds of the present invention may be prepared in analogy with known  synthetic  methodology  (see,  e.g.,  Shanklin,  Jr.  et  al., U.S.   Patent,<br>
10 5,130,309). Figure 1 outlines the preparation of a trans compound of the invention, where this preparation is more fully described in Example 1. As outlined in Figure 1, the preparation of a trans compound of the invention may be achieved by following a four step procedure.<br>
In a first step (denoted "i)" in Figure 1), cyclohexene epoxide undergoes<br>
15 a ring-opening reaction with an amine. See, e.g., Szmuszkovicz, U.S. Patent 4,145,435. While the reaction can occur at room temperature, typically elevated temperature is preferred in order to drive the reaction to completion in a commercially desirable length of time. The reaction is typically conducted in a solvent, such as water, and the reflux temperature of the solvent provides a suitable temperature. Equal molar amounts of the<br>
20 amine and cyclohexene epoxide typically provide satisfactory results. In any event, the amine nitrogen reacts with the epoxide group to form a 1-hydroxy 2-amino cyclohexane, where the hydroxy and amine groups are typically disposed in a trans relationship. A wide variety of amine compounds and substituted cyclohexene oxides may be employed in this general reaction, and Figure 1 illustrates this reaction in the<br>
25    instance where the amine is morpholine and the cyclohexene oxide is unsubstituted.<br><br>
For other amines or substituted cyclohcxene epoxides that may contain other reactive<br>
functional groups, appropriate protection groups are introduced prior to step i) being<br>
carried out. Suitable protecting groups are set forth in, for example, Greene, "Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York NY (1991).<br>
5	In a second step (denoted "ii)" in Figure 1) the hydroxy group that was<br>
derived from the epoxide, is converted into an activated form. An "activated form" as used herein means that the hydroxy group is converted into a good leaving group. The leaving group illustrated in Figure 1 is a mesylate group, and that is a preferred leaving group. However, the hydroxy group could be converted into other leaving groups 10 according to procedures well known in the art. In a typical reaction, the aminocyclohexanol compound is treated with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine as shown in Figure 1. The reaction is satisfactorily conducted at about 0°C. An excess of the methanesulfonyl chloride, relative to the aminocyclohexanol, is typically preferred in order to maximally convert the more<br>
15 valuable aminocyclohexanol into the activated form. For some other aminocyclohexanol compounds, it may be necessary to introduce appropriate protection groups prior to step ii) being performed. Suitable protecting groups are set forth in, for example, Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York NY( 1991)<br>
20	In a third step (denoted "iii)" in Figure 1) an alcohol is reacted with a<br>
strong base to provide an alkoxide salt. Conversion of an alcohol to an alkoxide (also known as an alcoholate) using strong base is a general reaction, and will work with a wide variety of hydroxy-containing compounds. In some instances, the alcohol compound may have other reactive functional groups that are desirably protected prior<br>
25 to contact of the alcohol with strong base. Suitable protecting groups are set forth in, for example, Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York NY (1991). Such alcohols are either commercially available or may be obtained by procedures described in the art or adapted therefrom, where suitable procedures may be identified through the Chemical Abstracts and Indices therefor, as<br>
30    developed and published by the American Chemical Society.<br><br>
In a fourth step (denoted "iv)" in Figure 1), the alcoholate of step "iii)" is reacted with the activated aminocyclohexanol of step "ii)". Thus, generally stated, compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an activated form of the appropriate 1,2-aminocyclohcxanol (1 mol) with an alcoholate (1.25 mol) prepared 5 by treatment of the selected alcohol (1.25 mol) with, for example, sodium hydride (1.3 mol). The 1,2-aminocyclohexanol (1 mol) can be activated by forming the corresponding mesylate, in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride (1.25 mol) and tneihylamine (1.5 mol). The mesylate is added quickly to the alcoholate, in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide. The reaction temperature is monitored carefully in<br>
10 order to avoid undesired side-reactions such as p-elimination. In general, a reaction temperature of 80-90°C for 2 hours is typically suitable to form compounds of the invention. When the reaction has proceeded to substantial completion, the desired product is recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional organic chemistry techniques,   and   is   purified   generally  by   column   chromatography   followed   by<br>
15 recrystallisation. Protective groups may be removed at the appropriate stage of the reaction sequence. Suitable methods are set forth in, for example, Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York NY (1991).<br>
The  reaction  sequence  described  above  (and  shown  in  Figure   1) generates the aminocyclohexyl ether as the free base. The pure enantiomeric forms can<br>
20 be obtained by preparative chiral HPLC. The free base may be converted, if desired, to the monohydrochloride salt by known methodologies, and subsequently, if desired, to other acid addition salts by reaction with inorganic or organic salts. Acid addition salts can also be prepared metathetically by reacting one acid addition salt with an acid which is stronger than that of the anion of the initial salt.<br>
25	Cis or trans compounds of the invention may be prepared according to<br>
the chemistry outlined in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, 1, 2-aminocyclohexanones may be prepared by Swem oxidation of the corresponding trans-l, 2-aminocyclohexanol compounds (which may be prepared as described above) using oxalyl  chloride/dimethyl sulfoxide (see, e.g.,  Synthesis   1980,   165).     Subsequent<br>
30    reduction of the aminocyclohexanone with lithium aluminum hydride or sodium.<br><br>
borohydride provides a mixture of cis- and trans-aminocyclohexanols. The mixture of aminoalcohols may be estcrified with an appropriate carboxylic acid by azeotropic distillation in toluene in the presence of a catalytic amount of P-toluenesulfonic acid, to provide a diastereomeric mixture of cis- and frans-esters. The mixture of 5 diastereomeric esters can be separated by preparative chromatography by one of ordinary skill in the art. The racemic cis- or trans ester preparation could then be reduced with sodium borohydride in the presence of Lewis acid to the corresponding racemic cis- or trans-eiher (see, e.g., J. Org. Chem. 25, 875, 1960 and Tetrahedron 18, 953, 1962).    The racemic cis-ether can be resolved by preparative chiral HPLC as<br>
10    discussed above for the trans-compound.<br>
Alternatively, cis and trans compounds of the invention may be prepared according to the chemistry outlined in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, cyclohexene oxide can react with an alcohol (ROH) in the present of Mg(CIO4)2 (see, e.g., M. Chini et al., Synlett, 673-676, 1992) to provide 1,2-hydroxycyclohexyl ethers. Oxidation with<br>
15 pyridinium dichromate (see, e.g., R. Oshimaet al., J. Org. Chem., 50, 2613-2621, 1985) yielded the corresponding 1,2-alkoxycyclohcxanone. Subsequent reductive animation (R. F. Borch et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 93(12), 2897-2904, 1971) provides a mixture of cis- and rrans-aminocyclohexyl ethers. The mixture of diastereomeric ethers can be separated by chromatography by one of ordinary skill in the art.   The racemic cis- or<br>
20 trans-ether so prepared could then be resolved by classical recrystallization methods well known in the art or by preparative chiral HPLC to provide the individual enantiomer: trans-(1R,2R), trans-(1S,,2S), m-(lR,2S) or cis-(1S,2R) aminoethers.<br>
The synthetic procedures described herein, especially when taken with the general knowledge in the art, provide sufficient guidance to those of ordinary skill<br>
25 in the art to perform the synthesis, isolation, and purification of the compounds of the present invention.<br>

Pharmacological Testing<br>
5	As   noted   above,   the  present   invention   provides   for   utilizing   the<br>
compounds described above in in vitro and in vivo methods. In one embodiment, ion channels, such as cardiac sodium channels, are blocked in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Ion channels are ubiquitous membrane proteins in the cells of warm¬blooded animals such as mammals. Their critical physiological roles include control of<br>
10 the electrical potential across the membrane, mediation of ionic and fluid balance, facilitation of neuromuscular and neuronal transmission, rapid transmembrane signal transduction, and regulation of secretion and contractility.<br>
Accordingly, compounds that are capable of modulating the activity or function of the appropriate ion channels will be useful in treating or preventing a variety<br>
15 ot diseases or disorders caused by defective or inadequate function of the ion channels. The compounds of the invention are found to have significant activity in modulating ion channel activity both in vivo and in vitro.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides for methods of treating a disease or condition in a warm-blooded animal suffering from or having the disease or condition,<br>
20 and/or preventing a disease or condition from arising in a warm-blooded animal, wherein a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a composition containing a compound of formula (I) is administered to a warm-blooded animal in need thereof. The diseases and conditions to which the compounds, compositions  and  methods  of the  present  invention  may  be  applied  as  follows:<br>
25 arrhythmia, diseases of the central nervous system, convulsion, epileptic spasms, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, respiratory disorders, cystic fibrosis, asthma, cough, inflammation, arthritis, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, urinary incontinence, irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral or myocardial ischemias, hypertension, long-QT syndrome, stroke, migraine, ophthalmic<br><br>
diseases, diabetes mcllitus, myopathics, Becker's myotonia, myasthenia gravis, paramyotonia congentia, malignant hyperthermia, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, Thomson's myotonia, autoimmune disorders, graft rejection in organ transplantation or bone marrow transplantation, heart failure, hypotension, Alzheimer's disease or other 5     mental disorder, and alopecia.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for producing local analgesia or anesthesia in a warm-blooded animal which includes administering to a warm blooded animal in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of formula (I). These 10 methods may be used to relieve or forestall the sensation of pain in a warm-blooded animal.<br>
Furthermore,   the   present   invention   provides   a   method   wherein   a<br>
preparation that contains ion channels is contacted with, or a warm-blooded animal<br>
(e.g., a  mammal,  such  as  a  human)  is administered  an  effective  amount  of an<br>
15     aminocyclohexyl ether compound of the invention.   Suitable preparations containing<br>
cardiac sodium channels include cells isolated from cardiac tissue as well as cultured<br>
cell lines. The step of contacting includes, for example, incubation of ion channels with<br>
a compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to permit modulation of the<br>
activity of the channels by the compound.<br>
20	In another embodiment, the compounds described above are provided for<br>
treating arrhythmia.   As used herein, "treating arrhythmia" refers to both therapy for<br>
arrhythmia and for the prevention of arrhythmias occurring in a heart that is susceptible<br>
to arrhythmia. An effective amount of a composition of the present invention is used to<br>
treat arrhythmia in a warm-blooded animal, such as a human. Methods of administering<br>
25     effective amounts of antiarrhythmic agents are well known in the art and include the<br>
administration of an oral or parenteral dosage form. Such dosage forms include, but are<br>
not limited to, parenteral dosage form.  Such dosage forms include, but are not limited<br>
to, parenteral solutions, tablets, capsules, sustained release implants, and transdermal<br>
delivery systems.    Generally, oral or intravenous administration is preferred.    The<br>
30    dosage amount and frequency are selected to create an effective level of the agent<br><br>
without harmful effects. It will generally range from a dosage of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg/day, and typically from about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg where administered orally or intravenously for antiarrhythmic effect.<br>
Administration of compositions of the present invention may be carried 5 out in combination with the administration of other agents. For example, it may be desired to administer an opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, if a compound exhibits opioid activity where such activity may not be desired. The naloxone may antagonize opioid activity of the administered compound without adverse interference with the antiarrhythmic activity.   As another example, an aminocyclohexyl ether compound of<br>
10 the invention may be co-administered with epinephrine in order to include local anesthesia<br>
In order to assess whether a compound has a desired pharmacological activity with the present invention, it is subjected to a series of tests. The precise test to employ will depend on the physiological response of interest.  The published literature<br>
15 contains numerous protocols for testing the efficacy of a potential therapeutic agent, and these protocols may be employed with the present compounds and compositions<br>
For example, in connection with treatment or prevention of arrhythmia, a series of four tests may be conducted. In the first of these tests, a compound of the present invention is given as increasing (doubling with each dose) intravenous boluses<br>
20 every 8 minutes to a pentobarbital anesthetized rat. The effects of the compound on blood pressure, heart rate and the ECG are measured 30 seconds, 1, 2, 4 and 8 minutes after each dose. Increasing doses are given until the animal dies. The cause of death is identified as being of either respiratory or cardiac origin. This test gives an indication as to whether the compound is modulating the activity of sodium channels and/or<br>
25 potassium channels, and in addition gives information about acute toxicity. The indices of sodium channel blockade are increasing P-R interval and QRS widening of the ECG Potassium channel blockade results in Q-T interval prolongation of the ECG.<br>
A second test involves administration of a compound as an infusion to pentobarbital anesthetized rats in which the left ventricle is subjected to electrical<br>
30    square wave stimulation performed according to a preset protocol described in further<br><br>
detail below. This protocol includes the determination of thresholds for induction of extrasystoles and ventncular fibrillation In addition, effects on electrical refractoriness are assessed by a single extra beat technique. In addition effects on blood pressure, heart rate and the ECG are recorded In this test, sodium channel blockers produce the 5 ECG changes expected from the first test In addition, sodium channel blockers also raise the thresholds for induction of extrasystoles and ventricular fibrillation. Potassium channel blockade is revealed by increasing refractoriness and widening of (he Q-T intervals of the ECG.<br>
A third test involves exposing isolated rat hearts to increasing 10 concentrations of a compound Vcniricular pressures, heart rate, conduction velocity and ECG are recorded in the isolated heart in the presence of varying concentrations of the compound. The test provides evidence for direct toxic effects on the myocardium. Additionally, selectivity, potency and efficacy of action of a compound can be ascertained under conditions simulating ischemia. Concentrations found to be effective 15     in this test are expected to be efficacious in the electrophysiological studies.<br>
A fourth test is estimation of the antiarrhythmic activity of a compound<br>
against the arrhythmias induced by coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized rats.  It is<br>
expected that a good antiarrhythmic compound will have antiarrhythmic activity at<br>
doses which have minimal effects on cither the ECG, blood pressure or heart rate under<br>
20    normal conditions.<br>
All of the foregoing tests are performed using rat tissue. In order to ensure that a compound is not having effects which are only specific to rat tissue, further experiments arc performed in dogs and primates. In order to assess possible sodium channel and potassium channel blocking action in vivo in dogs, a compound is 25 tested for effects on the ECG, ventricular epicardial conduction velocity and responses to electrical stimulation. An anesthetized dog is subjected to an open chest procedure to expose the left ventricular epicardium. After the pericardium is removed from the heart a recording/stimulation electrode is sewn onto the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. Using this array, and suitable stimulation protocols, conduction velocity across the 30    epicardium as well as responsiveness to electrical stimulation can be assessed.   This<br><br>
information coupled with measurements of the ECG allow's one to assess whether sodium and/or potassium channel blockade occurs As in the first test in rats, a compound is given as a series of increasing bolus doses. At the same lime possible toxic effects of a compound on the dog's cardiovascular system is assessed.<br>
The effects of a compound on the ECG and responses to electrical stimulation are also assessed in intact, halothane anesthetized baboons {Pcipio anubis) In this preparation, a blood pressure cannula and ECG electrodes arc suitably placed in an anesthetized baboon In addition, a stimulating electrode is placed into the right ventricle, together with a monophasic action potential electrode. As in the tests described above, ECCi and electrical stimulation response to a compound reveal the possible presence of sodium and/or potassium channel blockade. The monophasic action potential also reveals whether a compound widens the action potential, an action expected of a potassium channel blocker.<br>
As another example, in connection with the mitigation or prevention of the sensation of pain, the following test may be performed. To determine the effects of a compound of the present invention on an animal's response to a sharp pain sensation, the effects of a slight prick from a 7.5 g weighted syringe fitted with a 23G needle as applied to the shaved back of a guinea pig (Cavio porcellus) is assessed following subcutaneous administration of sufficient (50 pl, 10 mg/ml) solution in saline to raise a visible bleb on the skin Each test was done on the central area of the bleb and also on its periphery to check for diffusion of the test solution from the point of administration (f the test animal produces a flinch in response to the stimulus, this demonstrates the absence of blockade of pain sensation. Testing was carried out at intervals for up to 4 hours post administration. The sites of bleb formation were examined after 24 hours and showed no skin abnormalities consequent to local administration of test substances or of saline, the vehicle used for preparation of the test solutions.<br>

The present invention also provides kits that contain a pharmaceutical composition which includes one or more compounds of the above formulae.   The kit<br><br>
also includes instructions for the use of the pharmaceutical composition for modulating the activity of ion channels, for the treatment of arrhythmia or for the production of local analgesia and/or anesthesia, and for the other utilities disclosed herein. Preferably, a commercial package will contain one or more unit doses of the pharmaceutical composition, for example, such a unit dose may be an amount sufficient for «the preparation of an intravenous injection It will he evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that compounds which are light and or air sensitive may require special packaging and/or formulation.

ASSESSMKNT OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC EFFICACY Antiarrhythmic efficacy was assessed by investigating the effect o( a compound on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in conscious rats subject to coronary artery occlusion. Rats weighing 200-300 gms were subjected to preparative surgery and 5 assigned to groups in a random block design. In each case, the animal was anesthetized with halolhaue during surgical preparation The left femoral artery was cannulated for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure and withdrawal of blood samples. The left femoral vein was also cannulated for injection of drugs. The thoracic cavity was opened and a polyethylene occluder loosely placed around the left anterior descending<br>
10 coronary artery. The thoracic cavity was then closed. ECG was recorded by insertion of electrodes placed along the anatomical axis of the heart. All cannulae and electrode leads were exteriorized in the mid scapular region. In a random and double-blind manner, about 0.5 to 2 hours post-surgery, an infusion of vehicle, or the compound to be tested was given.    After 15 minutes infusion, the occluder was pulled so as to<br>
15 produce coronary artery occlusion. ECG, arrhythmias, blood pressure, heart rate and mortality were monitored for 30 minutes after occlusion. Arrhythmias were recorded as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) and scored according to Curtis, M.J. and Walker, M.J.A., Cardiovasc. Res. 22:656 (1988) (see Table 2).<br>

EXAMPLE 29 MEASUREMENT OF ECG PARAMETERS<br>
Rats weighing 200-250 gms were used in this example.   Animals were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbitone i.p.   The carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated for measurement of blood pressure and drug injection, respectively ECG was recorded by insertion of electrodes placed along the anatomical axis of the heart. All compounds were given as bolus injections<br>
Various ECG parameters were measured. Table 4 describes the results of the tests as ED25 (micromol/kg) which are the doses required to produce a 25% increase in the parameter measured (nc = not estimated). The increases in P-R interval and QRS interval indicate cardiac sodium channel blockage while the increase in Q-T inten'al indicates ancillary cardiac potassium channel blockage which is the property of a type la antiarrhythmic.<br><br><br>
Table 4<br>
EXAMPLE 30 ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKAGE<br><br>
Rats were prepared according to the preceding procedure. Two silver stimulating electrodes were inserted through the chest wall and implanted in the left ventricle. Square wave stimulation was used to determine threshold current for capture, ventricular fibrillation threshold current, and effective refractor)' period (Howard, P.G. and Walker. M.J.A., Proc. West. Pharmacol. Soc. Jj: 123-127 (1990)). Table 5 contains BD:s values for these indices of cardiac sodium channel blockage, where the ED25 is the infusion rate in micromol/kg/minute of compound required to elicit a 25% increase from control. The increases in refractoriness indicate ancillary blockage of potassium channels. The threshold current for capture is represented by "It". The fibrillation threshold current is represented by "VFT". The effective refracting period is represented by "F.RP".<br>

CANINE VAGAL-AF MODKI.<br>
General methods<br>
Mongrel dogs of either sex weighing 15-49 kg were anesthetized with morphine (2 mg/kg im initially, followed by 0.5 mg/kg IV every 2 h) and a-chloralose (120 mg/kg IV followed by an infusion of 29.25 mg/kg/h; St.-Georges et al., 1997).<br><br>
Dogs were ventilated mechanically with room air supplemented with oxygen via an endotracheal lube at 20 to 25 breaths/minute with a tidal volume obtained from a nomogram. Arterial blood gases were measured and kept in the physiological range (SAO2&gt;90%, pH 7.30-7.45). Catheters were inserted into the femoral artery for blood 5 pressure recording and blood gas measurement, and into both femoral veins for drug administration and venous sampling Catheters were kept patent with heparinized 0.9% saline solution. Body temperature was maintained at 37-40'C with a heating blanket.<br>
The heart was exposed via a medial thoracotomy and a pericardial cradle was created. Three bipolar stainless steel, Teflon™-coated electrodes were inserted into<br>
10 the right atna for recording and stimulation, and one was inserted into the left atrial appendage for recording. A programmable stimulator (Digital Cardiovascular Instruments, Berkeley, CA) was used to stimulate the right atnum with 2 ms, twice diastolic threshold pulses. Two stainless steel, Teflon™-coated electrodes were inserted into the left ventricle, one for recording and the other for stimulation.   A ventricular<br>
15 demand pacemaker (GBM 5880, Mcdtronics, Minneapolis, MN) was used to stimulate the ventricles at 90 beats/minute when (particular during vagal-AF) the ventricular rate became excessively slow. A P23 ID transducer, electrophysiological amplifier (Bloom Associates, Flying Hills, PA) and paper recorder (Astromed MT-95000, Toronto, ON, Canada) were used to record ECG leads II and III, atrial and ventricular electrograms,<br>
20 blood pressure and stimulation artefacts The vagi were isolated in the neck, doubly-ligated and divided, and electrodes inserted in each nerve (see below). To block changes in P-adrenergic effects on the heart, nadolol was administered as an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg iv, followed by 0.25 mg/kg [V every two hours.<br>
Atrial fibrillation model<br>
25	Drug effects to terminate sustained AF maintained during continuous<br>
vagal nerve stimulation were assessed. Unipolar hook electrodes (stainless steel insulated with Teflon™, coated except for the distal 1-2 cm) were inserted via a 21 gauge needle within and parallel to the shaft of each nerve. In most experiments, unipolar stimuli were applied with a stimulator (model DS-9F, Grass Instruments,<br><br>
Quincy, MA) set to deliver 0.1 ms square wave pulses at 10 Hz and a voltage 60% of that required to produce asystole. In some experiments, bipolar stimulation was used. The voltage required to produce asystole ranged between 3-20 volts. Under control conditions, a short burst of rapid atrial pacing (10 Hz, four times diastolic threshold) was delivered to induce AF which was ordinarily sustained for more than 20 minutes. The vagal stimulation voltage was adjusted under control conditions, and then readjusted after each treatment to maintain the same bradycardic effect. AF was defined as rapid (&gt;500 minute under control conditions), irregular atnal rhythm with varying electrogram morphology.<br>
Measurement of electrophysiological variables and vaual response<br>
Diastolic threshold current was determined at a basic cycle length of 300 ms by increasing the current 0.1 mA incrementally until stable capture was obtained. For subsequent protocols current was set to twice diastolic threshold. Atrial and ventricular ER.P was measured with the extrastimulus method, over a range of S1S2 intervals at a basic cycle length of JOU ms A premature extrastimulus S2 was introduced every 15 basic stimuli. The SIS2 interval was increased in 5 ms increments until capture occurred, with the longest S1S2 interval consistently failing to produce a propagated response defining ERP Diastolic threshold and ERP were determined in duplicate and averaged to give a single value These values were generally within 5 ms. The interval between the stimulus artefact and the peak of the local electrogram was measured as an index of conduction velocity AF cycle length (AFCL) was measured during vagal-AF by counting the number of Cycles (number of beats -1) over a 2-second interval at each of the atrial recording sites The three AFCLs measurements were averaged to obtain an overall mean AFCL. for each experimental condition.<br>
The stimulus voltage-heart rate relationship for vagal nerve stimulation was determined under control conditions in most experiments. The vagal nerves were stimulated as described above with various voltages to determine the voltage which caused asystole (defined as a sinus pause greater than 3 seconds). The response to vagal nerve stimulation was confirmed under each experimental condition and the voltage<br><br>
adjusted to maintain the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation constant In cases in which is was not possible to produce asystole, vagal nerve stimulation was adjusted to a voltage which allowed two 20-minute episodes of vagal-AF to be maintained under control conditions (see below).<br>
5     Experimental protocols<br>
The experimental groups studied are summarized in Table 5.   Each dog received only one drug at doses indicated in Table 5.   The first series of experiments were dose ranging studies, followed by blinded study in which 1-3 doses were given All drugs were administered IV via an infusion pump, with drug solutions prepared<br>
10 freshly in plastic containers on the day of the experiment. Vagal stimulation parameters were defined under control conditions as described above, and maintenance of AF during 20 minutes of vagal nerve stimulation under control conditions was verified. After the termination of AF, the diastolic threshold and ERP of the atrium and ventricle were determined.   Subsequently, these variables were reassessed in the atrium under<br>
15     vagal nerve stimulation.   Electrophysiological testing usually took 15-20 minutes. The heart   rate   response   to   vagal   nerve   stimulation   was  confirmed   and   the   vagal AF/electrophysiological testing protocol was repeated.   A pre-drug blood sample was obtained and vagal-AF reinstituted.    Five minutes later, one of the treatments was administered at doses shown in Table 5.  The total dose was infused over 5 minutes and<br>

If AF terminated within 15 minutes, the electrophysiological measurements obtained under control conditions were repeated and a blood sample was obtained. If AF was not terminated by the first dose (within 1 5 minutes), a blood sample was obtained and vagal stimulation    was    discontinued    to    allow    a    return    to    sinus    rhythm.        The<br>

EXAMPLE 32 5<br>
CANINE STERILE PERJCARDITLS MODEL<br>
This model has been used to characterize the mechanisms of AF and atrial flutter (AFL).  Waldo and colleagues have found that AF depends on reentry and<br>
10 that the site of termination is usually an area of slowed conduction. This canine model is prepared by dusting ihe exposed atria with talcum powder followed by "burst" pacing the atria over a period of days after recovery. AF is inducible two days after surgery, however, by the fourth day after surgical preparation; sustainable atrial flutter is the predominant inducible rhythm    The inducibility of AF at day 2 is somewhat variable,<br>
15 such that only 50% of dogs may have sustained AF (generally 
20 the sterile pericarditis model mimics. There may be an inflammatory component involved in the etiology of post surgery AF that would provide a degree of selectivity to an ischaemia or acid selective drug. Similarly, while coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is performed to alleviate ventricular ischaemia, such patients may also be at risk for mild atrial ischaemia due to coronary artery disease (CAD)    While atrial<br>
25 infarcts arc rare, there has been an association between AV nodal artery stenosus and risk for AF following CABG surgery. Surgical disruption of the autonomic innervation of the atria may also play a role in AF following CABG.<br>
Methods<br>
Studies were carried out in a canine model of sterile percarditts to 30    determine   the   potency   and   efficacy   of   Compound    1    in   terminating   atrial<br><br>
fibrillation/flutter. Atrial flutter or fibrillation was induced 2 to 4 days after creation of sterile pericarditis in adult mongrel dogs weighing 19 kg to 25 kg. In all instances, the atrial fibrillation or flutter lasted longer than 10 minutes. All studies were performed in accordance with guidelines specified by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the American Heart Association Policy on Research Animal Use, and the Public Health Service Policy on Use of Laboratory' Animals.<br>
Creation of the Sterile Pericarditis Atrial Fib/Flutter Model<br>
The canine sterile pericarditis model was created as previously described. At the time of surgery, a pair of stainless steel wire electrodes coated with FEP polymer except for the tip (O Flexon, Davis and Geek) were sutured on the righi atrial appendage, Bachman's bundle and the posteroinferior left atrium close to the proximal portion of the coronary sinus. The distance between each electrode of each pair was approximately 5 mm. These wire electrodes were brought out through the chest wall and exteriorized posteriorly in the interscapular region for subsequent use At the completion of surgery, the dogs were given antibiotics and analgesics and then were allowed to recover. Postoperative care included administration of antibiotics and analgesics.<br>
In all dogs, beginning on postoperative day 2, induction of stable atrial fibrillation/flutter was attempted in the conscious, non-sedated state to confirm the inducibility and the stability of atrial fib/flutter and to test the efficacy of the drugs. Atrial pacing was performed through the electrodes sutured during the initial surgery. On postoperative day 4, when stable atrial flutter was induced, the open-chest study was performed.<br>
For the open-chest study, each dog was anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/'kg IV) and mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen by use of a Boyle model 50 anesthesia machine (Harris-Lake, Inc.). The body temperature of each dog was kept within the normal physiological range throughout the study with a heating pad. With the dog anesthetized, but before the chest was opened, radiofrequency ablation of the His bundle was performed to create complete atrioventricular (AV) block by standard<br><br>
electrode catheter techniques This was done to minimize the superimposition of atrial and ventricular complexes during subsequent recordings of unipolar atrial electrograms after induction of atrial flutter After complete AV block was created, an effective ventricular rate was maintained by pacing of the ventricles at a rate of 60 to 80 beats per 5 minute with a Medtronic 5375 Pulse Generator (Medtronic Inc.) to deliver stimuli via the electrodes sutured to the right ventricle during the initial surgery.<br>
Determination of Stimulus Thresholds and Refractory Periods During Pacing<br>
For the induction of AF'AFL, one of two previously described methods was used:  (1) introduction of one or two premature atrial beats after a train of 8 paced<br>
10 atrial beats at a cycle length of 400 ms, 300 ms, 200 ms, or 150 ms, or (2) rapid atrial Pacing for Periods of 1 to 10 seconds at rates incrementally faster by 10 to 50 beats per minute than the spontaneous sinus rate until atrial flutter was induced or there was a loss of 1:1 atrial capture. Atrial pacing was performed from either the right atrial appendage electrodes  rr the postcroinferior  '-ft  atrial electrodes.     All  pacing  was<br>
15 performed using stimuli of twice threshold for each basic drive train with a modified Medtronic 5325 programmable, battery-powered stimulator with a pulse width of 1.8 ms<br>
After the induction of stable atrial fib/flutter (lasting longer than 10 minutes), the atrial fib/flutter cycle length was measured and the initial mapping and<br>
20 analysis were performed to determine the location of the atrial fib/flutter reentrant circuit. Atrial flutter was defined as a rapid atrial rhythm (rate, &gt;240 beats per minute) characterized by a constant beat-to-beat cycle length, polarity, morphology, and amplitude of the recorded bipolar electrograms.<br>
Drug Efficacy Testing Protocol<br>
25	1.	Effective refractory periods (ERPs) were measured from three<br>
sites: right atrial appendage (RAA), posterior left atrium (PLA), and Bachman's Bundle (BB), at two basic cycle lengths 200 and 400 ms.<br><br>
2.	Pace induce A-Fib or AI'L. This was attempted for one hour. If no arrhythmia was induced, no further study was done on that day.<br>
3.	If induced, AF must have been sustained for 10 minutes. Then a waiting period was allowed for spontaneous termination or 20 minutes, whichever came first.<br>
4.	AF was then reinduced and 5 minutes was allowed before starting drug infusion.<br>
5.	Drug was then infused in a bolus over 5 minutes.<br>
6.	If AF terminated with the first dose then a blood sample was taken and ER.P measurements were repeated.<br>
7.	Five minutes was allowed for the drug to terminate. If there was no termination then the second dose-was given over 5 minutes.<br>
8.	After termination and ERPs were measured, a second attempt to reinduce AF was tried for a period often minutes.<br>
9.	If reinduced and sustained for 10 minutes, a blood sample was taken and the study repeated from #3 above.<br>
10.	If no reinduction, then the study was over<br><br>

ASSESSMENT OF PAIN BLOCKAGE<br>
Guinea pigs were shaved (backs only) and 6 aliquots (50 ul) of compound solution (10 mg/ml) were injected just beneath the skin to form 6 blebs which were outlined with a permanent marker. Pain responses were assessed as above on each bleb at regular intervals up to 4 hours post injection and the duration of pain blockage was recorded for three animals for each test solution.<br>
