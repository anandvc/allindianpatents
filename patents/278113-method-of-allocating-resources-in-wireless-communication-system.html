METHOD OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES IN WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a wireless communication process, and more par-<br>
ticularly, to a method of allocating resources in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A third generation partnership project (3GPP) mobile system based on a wideband<br>
code division multiple access (WCDMA) radio access technology has been widely<br>
deployed all over the world. A high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), which is<br>
a first step in the evolution of the WCDMA, provides the 3GPP with a radio access<br>
technology having high competitiveness. However, since radio access technology has<br>
been continuously developed in view of requirements and expectations of users and<br>
providers, evolution of a new technology in the 3GPP is required to increase compet-<br>
itiveness. There are required reduced cost per bit, increased service availability,<br>
flexible use of a frequency band, a simple structure and an open interface, and<br>
adequate power consumption of a user equipment.<br>
[3]	A wireless communication system needs to provide various radio services such as a<br>
web browsing service, a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service, in addition to a<br>
voice service. In order to provide various radio services, at least one radio bearer has to<br>
be set up between a base station and a user equipment. Radio bearers can be configured<br>
with different priorities or equal priorities. For example, although the voice service<br>
uses a relatively small amount of transmission rate but needs to minimize transmission<br>
delay. On the contrary, a web browsing service needs a relatively large amount of<br>
transmission rate but does not matter transmission delay. A plurality of radio bearers<br>
are configured so as to support various applications and concurrently provide various<br>
radio services. The plurality of radio bearers may have different priorities or equal<br>
priorities like in a case where a plurality of web browsers are concurrently provided.<br>
[4]	A method is sought for efficiently allocating resources to the plurality of radio<br>
bearers having priorities.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[5]	The present invention provides a method of allocating resources to a plurality of<br>
radio bearers having equal priorities.<br>
[6]	The present invention also provides a method of allocating resources to a plurality of<br>
logical channels having equal priorities.<br>
 <br>
Technical Solution<br>
[7]	In an aspect, a method of allocating resources in a wireless communication system is<br>
provided. The method includes configuring priorities for a plurality of logical channels<br>
according to a first criterion, wherein each of the plurality of logical channels has each<br>
priority and allocating resources to a subset of the plurality of logical channels<br>
according to a second criterion to transfer data through a transport channel, wherein the<br>
subset of the plurality of logical channels is configured with same priority.<br>
[8]	In another aspect, a method of transmitting data from an upper layer to a lower layer<br>
is provided. The method includes determining transmission priorities of a plurality of<br>
logical channels to transmit data of the plurality of logical channels according to a<br>
criterion, wherein the plurality of logical channels have same logical channel priorities,<br>
and transmitting the data of the plurality of logical channels based on the determined<br>
transmission priorities.<br>
[9]	In still another aspect, a method of allocating resources in a wireless communication<br>
system is provided. The method includes configuring a priority for each logical<br>
channel according to a first criterion and allocating resources in a transport channel<br>
according to a second criterion, wherein the transport channel is mapped to a plurality<br>
of logical channels configured with same priority.<br>
[10]	In still another aspect, a method of allocating resources in a wireless communication<br>
system is provided. The method includes configuring a priority for each logical<br>
channel according to a first criterion and allocating resources in a transport channel,<br>
the transport channel being mapped to a plurality of logical channels configured with<br>
same priority, the plurality of logical channels having same amount of transmission<br>
data.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[11]	As a communication system has been developed, there is a need to run multiple ap-<br>
plications and to concurrently provide various services. Specifically, when a plurality<br>
of radio bearers having equal priorities are concurrently configured like a case where a<br>
plurality of web browsers are concurrently used, quality of service may not be<br>
guaranteed if any efficient method of processing equal priorities is not available. Ac-<br>
cordingly, it is possible to reliably provide various services through a method of<br>
processing radio bearers having the equal priorities.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[27]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a wireless communication system. This may be a<br>
network structure of an E-UMTS (Evolved-Universal Mobile telecommunications<br>
System). The E-UMTS system may be referred to as an LTE (Long-term Evolution)<br>
system. The wireless communication system can widely be deployed to provide a<br>
variety of communication services, such as voices, packet data, and the like.<br>
[28]	Referring to FIG. 1, an E-UTRAN (Evolved-UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access<br>
Network) includes at least one base station (BS) 20. A user equipment (UE) 10 can be<br>
fixed or mobile and can be referred to as another terminology, such as a MS (Mobile<br>
Station), a UT (User Terminal), a SS (Subscriber Station), a wireless device, or the<br>
like. The BS 20 generally is a fixed station that communicates with the user equipment<br>
10 and can be referred to as another terminology, such as an e-NB (evolved-NodeB), a<br>
BTS (Base Transceiver System), an access point, or the like. There are one or more<br>
cells within the coverage of the BS 20. Interfaces for transmitting user traffic or control<br>
traffic can be used between BSs 20. Hereinafter, downlink means communication from<br>
 <br>
the BS 20 to the UE 10, and uplink means a communication from the UE 10 to the BS<br>
20.<br>
[29]	The BSs 20 are interconnected with each other by means of an X2 interface. The BSs<br>
20 are also connected by means of the S1 interface to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core),<br>
more specifically to the MME (Mobility Management Entity) / SAE (System Ar-<br>
chitecture Evolution) Gateway. The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation<br>
between MME/SAE Gateway 30 and the BS 20.<br>
[30]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing functional split between the E-UTRAN and the<br>
EPC. Slashed boxes depict radio protocol layers and white boxes depict the functional<br>
entities of the control plane.<br>
[31]	Referring to FIG. 2, a BS hosts the following functions. (1) Functions for Radio<br>
Resource Management such as Radio Bearer Control, Radio Admission Control,<br>
Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of resources to UEs in both uplink<br>
and downlink (scheduling), (2) IP (Internet Protocol) header compression and en-<br>
cryption of user data stream, (3) Routing of User Plane data towards S-GW, (4)<br>
Scheduling and transmission of paging messages, (5) Scheduling and transmission of<br>
broadcast information, and (6) Measurement and measurement reporting configuration<br>
for mobility and scheduling.<br>
[32]	The MME hosts the following functions. (1) Dispersion of paging messages over the<br>
BSs, (2) Security control, (3) Idle state mobility control, (4) SAE bearer control, and<br>
(5) Ciphering and integrity protection of non-access stratum (NAS) signaling.<br>
[33]	An SAE gateway hosts the following functions. (1) Termination of a user plane<br>
packet with respect to paging and (2) Switching of a user plane for supporting mobility<br>
of the UE.<br>
[34]	FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing constitutional elements of a UE. A UE 50<br>
includes a processor 51, memory 52, a RF unit 53, a display unit 54 and a user<br>
interface unit 55. Layers of the radio interface protocol are implemented in the<br>
processor 51. The processor 51 provides a control plane and a user plane. The function<br>
of each layer can be implemented in the processor 51. The memory 52 is coupled to<br>
the processor 51 and stores an operating system, applications, and general files. The<br>
display unit 54 displays a variety of information of the UE and may use a well-known<br>
element, such as an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or OLED (Organic Light Emitting<br>
Diode. The user interface unit 55 can be configured with a combination of well-known<br>
user interfaces such as a keypad or touch screen. The RF unit 53 is coupled to the<br>
processor 51 and transmits and/or receives radio signals.<br>
[35]	Layers of the radio interface protocol between the user equipment and the base<br>
station can be classified into Ll layer (a first layer), L2 layer (a second layer), and L3<br>
layer (a third layer) based on the lower three layers of the Open System Inter-<br>
 <br>
connection (OSI) model that is well-known in the related art. A physical (PHY) layer<br>
belonging to the first layer provides information transfer service on a physical channel.<br>
A radio resource control (RRC) layer belonging to the third layer serves to control<br>
radio resources between the user equipment and the network. The user equipment and<br>
the network exchange RRC messages via the RRC layer.<br>
[36]	FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing radio protocol architecture for a user plane. FIG. 5<br>
is a block diagram showing radio protocol architecture for a control plane. They il-<br>
lustrate the architecture of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the E-<br>
UTRAN. The data plane is a protocol stack for user data transmission and the control<br>
plane is a protocol stack for control signal transmission.<br>
[37]	Referring to FIGs. 4 and 5, a physical (PHY) layer belonging to the first layer offers<br>
information transfer services to upper layers on a physical channel. The PHY layer is<br>
coupled with a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer, i.e., an upper layer of the PHY<br>
layer, through a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the<br>
PHY layer through the transport channel. Between different physical layers, i.e., the<br>
physical layer of a transmitter and the physical layer of a receiver, data are transferred<br>
through the physical channel. The physical channel may be modulated by orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The physical channel may use a time and a<br>
frequency as radio resources.<br>
[38]	The MAC layer in the second layer provides services to a RLC (Radio Link Control)<br>
layer, i.e., an upper layer of the MAC layer, through a logical channel. The RLC layer<br>
in the second layer supports reliable data transfer. There are three operating modes in<br>
the RLC layer, such as TM (Transparent Mode), UM (Unacknowledged Mode) and<br>
AM (Acknowledged Mode) according to a data transfer method. The AM RLC<br>
provides bidirectional data transmission service and supports re-transmission when the<br>
transfer of a RLC PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is failed.<br>
[39]	A PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) belonging to the second layer performs<br>
header compression function. The PDCP layer reduces the header size of the Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) packet so as to efficiently transmit the IP packet.<br>
[40]	A RRC (Radio Resource Control) layer belonging to the third layer is defined only in<br>
the control plane. The RRC layer serves to control the logical channel, the transport<br>
channel, and the physical channel in association with configuration, reconfiguration<br>
and release of radio bearers (RBs). A RB means a service provided by the second layer<br>
for data transmission between the user equipment and the network. When a RRC<br>
connection is established between the RRC layer of the user equipment and the RRC<br>
layer of the network, it is called that the user equipment is in the RRC connected mode.<br>
When a RRC connection is not established yet, it is called that the user equipment is in<br>
the RRC idle mode.<br>
 <br>
[41 ]	A NAS (Non-Access Stratum) layer belonging to the upper layer of the RRC layer<br>
serves to perform session management and mobility management.<br>
[42J	FIG. 6 shows mapping between downlink logical channels and downlink transport<br>
channels. FIG. 7 shows mapping between uplink logical channels and uplink transport<br>
channels.<br>
[43J	Referring to FIGs. 6 and 7, in downlink, a paging control channel (PCCH) can be<br>
mapped to a paging channel (PCH). A broadcast control channel (BCCH) can be<br>
mapped to a broadcast channel (BCD) or a downlink shared channel (DL-SCH). A<br>
common control channel (CCCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a dedicated<br>
traffic channel (DTCH), a multicast control channel (MCCH) and a multicast traffic<br>
channel (MTCH) can be mapped to the DL-SCH. The MCCH and MTCH can also be<br>
mapped to a multicast channel (MCH). In uplink, a CCCH, a DCCH and a DTCH can<br>
be mapped to a uplink shared channel (UL-SCH).<br>
[44]	Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred. A<br>
classification of logical channels is into two groups: control channels and traffic<br>
channels.<br>
[451	Control channels are used for transfer of control plane information. The BCCH is a<br>
downlink control channel for broadcasting system control information. The PCCH is a<br>
downlink channel that transfers paging information and is used when the network does<br>
not know the location cell of the UE. The CCCH is a channel for transmitting control<br>
information between UEs and network and is used for UEs having no RRC connection<br>
with the network. The MCCH is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel used for<br>
transmitting multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) control information from<br>
the network to the UE, for one or several MTCHs and is only used by UEs that receive<br>
MBMS. The DCCH is a point-to-point bi-directional channel that transmits dedicated<br>
control information between a UE and the network and is used by the UE having an<br>
RRC connection.<br>
[46]	Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information. The DTCH is a<br>
point-to-point channel dedicated to one UE, for the transfer of user information. The<br>
DTCH can exist in both uplink and downlink. The MTCH is a point-to-multipoint<br>
downlink channel for transmitting traffic data from the network to the UE and is only<br>
used by UEs that receive MBMS.<br>
[47]	The transport channels are classified by how and with what characteristics data are<br>
transferred over the radio interface. The BCH is broadcasted in the entire coverage area<br>
of the cell and has fixed, pre-defined transport format. The DL-SCH is characterized<br>
by support for hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), support for dynamic link ad-<br>
aptation by varying the modulation, coding and transmit power, possibility to be<br>
broadcast in the entire cell, possibility to use beamforming, support for both dynamic<br>
 <br>
and semi-static resource allocation, support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to<br>
enable UE power saving and support for MBMS transmission. The PCH is char-<br>
acterized by support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to enable UE power saving<br>
and requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell. The MCH is<br>
characterized by requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell,<br>
support for MBMS Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) combining of MBMS<br>
transmission on multiple cells.<br>
[48]	Uplink transport channels are a UL-SCH and a random access channel (RACH). The<br>
UL-SCH is characterised by support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the<br>
transmit power and potentially modulation and coding, support for HARQ and support<br>
for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation. The RACH is characterised by<br>
limited control information and collision risk.<br>
[49]	FIG. 8 shows mapping between downlink transport channels and downlink physical<br>
channels. FIG. 9 shows mapping between downlink transport channels and downlink<br>
physical channels.<br>
[50]	Referring to FIGs. 8 and 9, in downlink, a BCH can be mapped to a physical<br>
broadcast channel (PBCH). A MCH can be mapped to a physical multicast channel<br>
(PMCH). A PCH and a DL-SCH can be mapped to a physical downlink shared channel<br>
(PDSCH). The PBCH carries the BCH transport block. The PMCH carries the MCH.<br>
The PDSCH carries the DL-SCH and PCH. In uplink, a UL-SCH can be mapped to a<br>
physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). A RACH can be mapped to a physical<br>
random access channel (PRACH). The PRACH carries a random access preamble.<br>
[51]	There are several physical control channels used in the physical layer. A physical<br>
downlink control channel (PDCCH) informs the UE about the resource allocation of<br>
PCH and DL-SCH, and HARQ information related to DL-SCH. The PDCCH may<br>
carry the uplink scheduling grant which informs the UE about resource allocation of<br>
uplink transmission. A physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) informs<br>
the UE about the number of OFDM symbols used for the PDCCHs and is transmitted<br>
in every subframe, A physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH) carries HARQ<br>
ACK/NAK signals in response to uplink transmissions. A physical uplink control<br>
channel (PUCCH) carries uplink control information such as HARQ AC/NAK in<br>
response to downlink transmission, scheduling request and channel quality indicator<br>
(CQI). The PUCCH is not transmitted simultaneously with the PUSCH from the same<br>
UE.<br>
[52]	In order to provide various types of services, at least one RB may be configured. The<br>
RB is a logical link provided by the first and second layers among radio protocols<br>
between the UE and the network. A logical channel is allocated to an RB. A plurality<br>
of logical channels corresponding to a plurality of RBs are multiplexed and transmitted<br>
 <br>
through one transport channel.<br>
[53]	Each RB may have different logical channel priority (LCP) or equal LCP.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of transmitting data based on the LCP will be described.<br>
[54]	1. In case of Different LCPs<br>
[55]	When a plurality of RBs are multiplexed and transmitted through a transport channel,<br>
a MAC layer can determine amounts of transmission data of the RBs by using the<br>
following rules with respect to given radio resources whenever data is transmitted.<br>
[56]	(1) Amounts of transmission data are determined in the descending order of LCPs of<br>
the RBs. Data corresponding to the maximum prioritized bit rate (PBR) for each RB is<br>
determined as an amount of transmission data.<br>
[57]	(2) In a case where radio resources remains, amounts of transmission data are de-<br>
termined in the descending order of the LCPs, again, with respect to the multiplexed<br>
RBs.<br>
[58]	For example, when the LCPs range from 1 to 8, it is assumed that 1 is the highest<br>
priority and 8 is the lowest priority. The PBR is the minimum bit rate that is<br>
guaranteed by the RB. Even in a case where a wireless environment is very poor, a<br>
wireless communication system needs to provide the minimum bit rate. The PBR may<br>
ranges from zero to infinity.<br>
[59]	An LCP and/or a PBR information of an RB are transmitted from an RRC layer of a<br>
network to an RRC layer of an UE through an RB configuration message when the RB<br>
is initially configured. The RRC layer of the UE which receives the RB configuration<br>
message configures a RB and sends information on the LCP and the PBR of the RB to<br>
the MAC layer of the UE. The MAC layer that receives the information determines<br>
amounts of transmission data of the RB according to the aforementioned rales with<br>
respect to given radio resources for each transmission time interval (TTI). Hereinafter,<br>
the TTI is referred to as an interval to transmit data through one transport channel.<br>
[60]	FIG. 10 illustrates an example of a method of transmitting data with different LCPs.<br>
[61 ]	Referring to FIG. 10, three RBs RB 1 to RB3 are multiplexed in one transport<br>
channel. Here, it is assumed that LCP1 of the RBI is 1, LCP2 of the RB2 is 3, LCP3 of<br>
the RB3 is 5, BR1 of the RB1 is 300 bit/TTI, PBR2 of the RB2 is 400 bit/TTI, and<br>
PBR3 of the RB3 is 100 bit/TTI. The size of a transport block that is allocated to a<br>
transport channel is 1700 bits. The size of the transport block is the size of radio<br>
resources allocated to the transport channel and may vary for each TTI according to<br>
channel condition.<br>
[62]	A buffer occupancy BOl of the RBl is 700 bits, a buffer occupancy B02 of the RB2<br>
is 1500 bits, and a buffer occupancy B03 of the RB3 is 600 bits. A buffer occupancy<br>
(BO) is an amount of a buffer currently occupied by data. The occupied data can be<br>
divided into data corresponding to the PBR and the other data. Hereinafter, the data<br>
 <br>
corresponding to the PBR among BOs of the RBs is called as PBR data and the other<br>
data is called as remaining data.<br>
[63]	First, the MAC layer fills the transport block with the PBR data of RBs in the<br>
descending order of the LCPs with respect to given radio resources to the extent of the<br>
maximum PBR. In the example of FIG. 10, the LCP1 of the RBl is the highest, the<br>
LCP2 of the RB2 is the next highest, and the LCPS of the RB3 is the lowest. Thus,<br>
amounts of transmission data are determined in the order of RB1, RB2 and RB3, to the<br>
extent of the PBR. That is, the transport block is filled with 800 bits of PBR data in the<br>
order of the PBR1 of the RB 1 of 300 bits, the PBR2 of the RB2 of 400 bits, and the<br>
PBR3 of the RB3 of 100 bits.<br>
[64]	Next, in a case where radio resources remain in the transport block, the transport<br>
block is filled with the remaining data of the RBs in the descending order of the LCPs.<br>
In the example of FIG. 10, since the amount of the data of the RBs is filled according<br>
to the PBRs is 800 bits with respect to the transport block of the 1700 bits, extra<br>
resources of 900 bits remain. Accordingly, the transport block is filled with remaining<br>
data in the descending order of the LCPs. That is, all the remaining data of 400 bits of<br>
the RB 1 having the highest LCP are firstly filled. Then, remaining data of the RB2 is<br>
filled with extra resources of 500 bits.<br>
[65]	Finally, in this TTI, the determined amounts of transmission data of the RBs are RB 1<br>
= 700 bits, RB2 = 900 bits, and RB3 = 100 bits. The determined transmission data is<br>
carried by the one transport block.<br>
[66]	The order of filling the transport block with data of RBs in the transport block<br>
depends on an embodied method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data<br>
according to a rule for determining amounts of data so as to show a method of de-<br>
termining amounts of data.<br>
[67]	II. In case of equal LCPs<br>
[68]	In a case where the RBs having equal LCPs are multiplexed, a method of clear<br>
processing the RBs is needed. As a communication system has been developed, a<br>
network has to concurrently provide a plurality of services to UEs. Thus, a plurality of<br>
RBs with equal priorities can be configured. If a method of efficiently processing the<br>
RBs having equal LCPs is not defined, quality of service for RBs cannot be<br>
guaranteed. Accordingly, it is necessary to efficiently determine amounts of<br>
transmission data so that quality of service is not deteriorated even in a case where<br>
RBs having equal priorities are multiplexed.<br>
[69]	When the RBs having equal LCPs are multiplexed, it is possible to determine<br>
amounts of transmission data of the RBs in the following method.<br>
[70]	II-1. Equal Amount Allocation<br>
[71]	It is possible to allocate equal amounts of transmission data to the RBs with equal<br>
 <br>
LCPs. However, since PBRs are configured in the RBs, there are two methods based<br>
on whether the PBR allocation is included or not.<br>
[72]	FIG. 11 illustrates a method of allocating equal amounts of transmission data except<br>
PBR allocation. This means equal allocation of remaining resources after PBR al-<br>
location. First, amounts of transmission data are allocated to the extent of the PBRs of<br>
the RBs. The equal amounts of transmission data are allocated to the RBs with respect<br>
to the remaining radio resources. Conditions of FIG. 11 are the same as those of FIG.<br>
10 except that the LCPs of the RB2 and the RB3 are 5's.<br>
[73]	Referring to FIG. 11, first, amounts of transmission data are allocated to the RBs in<br>
the descending order of the LCPs to the extent of the PBRs. That is, the RB1 allocates<br>
the PBR1 of 300 bits. Since the RB2 and the RB3 have equal LCPs, the RB2 and the<br>
RB3 allocate the PBR2 of 400 bits and the PBR3 of 100 bits in any order. In the<br>
example of FIG. 11, the amount of transmission data is firstly allocated to the RB2.<br>
However, since the LCPs of the RB2 and the RB3 are equal, the amount of<br>
transmission data may be firstly allocated to the RB3.<br>
[74]	Amounts of transmission data are firstly allocated to the extent of the PBRs of the<br>
RBs. When radio resources remains in the transport block, the remaining radio<br>
resources are allocated in the descending order of the LCPs. 800 bits of the transport<br>
block having 1700 bits are allocated according to the PBRs of RBs, and 900 bits<br>
remain. Therefore, 400 bits to which all the remaining data can be transmitted are<br>
allocated to the RB 1 having the highest priority. Then, 250 bits are respectively<br>
allocated to the RB2 and the RB3 by equally dividing the remaining 500 bits.<br>
[75]	In this TTI, the determined amounts of transmission data of the RBs are RB 1 = 700<br>
bits, RB2 = 650 bits, and RB3 = 350 bits. The determined transmission data is earned<br>
by the one transport block.<br>
[76]	The order of filling the transport block with data of the RBs depends on an embodied<br>
method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data according to a rule for de-<br>
termining amounts of data so as to show a method of determining amounts of data.<br>
[77]	Fig. 12 illustrates a method of allocating equal amounts of transmission data<br>
including PBR allocation. This means equal allocation of total resources including<br>
PBR allocation. In this method, entire amounts of transmission data allocated to RBs<br>
having equal LCPs are the same regardless of PBRs of the RBs. This condition is the<br>
same as that of FIG. 11.<br>
[78]	Referring to FIG. 12, amounts of transmission data are allocated to RBs in the<br>
descending order of LCPs to the extent of the PBRs. That is, 300 bits of PBR1 are<br>
allocated for the RB1. Since the RB2 and the RB3 have equal LCPs, 400 bits of PBR2<br>
for the RB2 and 100 bits of PBR3 for the RB3 are allocated arbitrarily.<br>
[79]	Then, since radio resources of 900 bits remain, the remaining radio resources are<br>
 <br>
allocated in the descending order of the LCPs. 400 bits to which all the remaining data<br>
can be transmitted are allocated to the RB1 having the highest priority. The remaining<br>
500 bits are allocated to the RB2 and the RB3. In this time, 100 bits and 400 bits are<br>
allocated respectively to the RB2 and the RB3 so that the entire amounts of<br>
transmission data of the RB2 and the RB3 are equal.<br>
[80]	Finally, in this TT1, the determined amounts of transmission data of the RBs are RB1<br>
= 700 bits, RB2 = 500 bits, and RB3 = 500 bits. The determined transmission data are<br>
carried by one transport block.<br>
[81]	The order of filling the transport block with data of the RBs depends on an embodied<br>
method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data according to a rule for de-<br>
termining amounts of data so as to show a method of determining amounts of data.<br>
[82]	U-2. Prioritization with New Criterion<br>
[83]	If LCPs of RBs are equal, priorities of the RBs are not determined based on the<br>
LCPs. The priorities may be determined based on a new criterion. A new criterion may<br>
be a buffer occupancy (BO), a PBR, a maximum bit rate (MBR), a buffer latency<br>
period of data, or a TTI. Various criteria may be available.<br>
[84]	FIG. 13 illustrates a method of enabling an RB having a lower PBR to have a higher<br>
priority with respect to RBs having equal LCPs. That is, in the RBs having equal<br>
LCPs, PBRs are used instead of LCPs.<br>
[85]	Referring to FIG. 13, first, the MAC layer determines that an RB having a lower<br>
PBR has a higher priority by comparing PBRs of the RBs having the equal LCPs when<br>
RBs are configured. In the example of FIG. 13, although the LCPs of the RB2 and the<br>
RB3 are 5's, the PBR2 is 400 bits, and the PBR3 is 100 bits. Since the PBR3 is lower<br>
than the PBR2, the RB3 has a higher priority than the RB2. After determining<br>
priorities of the RBs, amounts of transmission data are allocated.<br>
[86]	First, amounts of transmission data are allocated to the RBs in the descending order<br>
of priorities that are determined according to the LCPs or PBRs of the RBs. That is,<br>
300 bits of the PBR1 are allocated to the RB1, 100 bits of the PBR3 are allocated to<br>
the RB3 having the next higher priority, and finally, 400 bits of the PBR2 are allocated<br>
to the RB2.<br>
[87]	Then, since radio resources of 900 bits remain, the remaining radio resources are<br>
allocated in the descending order of priorities determined according to the LCPs or<br>
PBRs. First, 400 bits to which all the remaining data can be transmitted are allocated to<br>
the RB1 having the highest priority, and 500 bits to which all the remaining data can<br>
be transmitted are allocated to the RB3 having the next highest priority. Now, no more<br>
radio resource remains. Thus, an amount of transmission data is not allocated to the<br>
RB2 having the lowest priority.<br>
[88]	Finally, in this TTI, the determined amounts of transmission data of the RBs are RB 1<br>
 <br>
= 700 bits, RB2 = 400 bits, and RB3 = 600 bits. The determined transmission data is<br>
carried by the one transport block.<br>
[89]	The order of filling the transport block with data of the RBs depends on an embodied<br>
method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data according to a rule for de-<br>
termining amounts of data so as to show a method of determining amounts of data.<br>
[90]	Here, although priorities of the RBs having the equal LCP are determined in the<br>
descending order of PBRs, priorities of the RBs may be determined in the ascending<br>
order of PBRs. Selectively, priorities of the RBs may be determined by using a new<br>
criterion such as a BO, an MBR, a buffer latency period of data, and the like.<br>
[91]	A criterion that is a PBR is used to determine priorities of RBs having the equal<br>
LCPs. Alternatively, various criteria or a combination of various criteria may be used.<br>
For example, priorities of the RBs having the equal LCPs may be determined in the<br>
ascending order of BOs/PBRs. If this criterion is applied to the example of FIG. 13,<br>
although the RB2 and the RB3 have the equal LCPs, a BO/PBR of the RB3 is greater<br>
than that of the RB2. Accordingly, the RB3 has a higher priority than the RB2. For<br>
another example, a TTI can be a candidate for the criterion. For example, for 3 RBs<br>
having equal logical channel priorities, we can prioritize them cyclically based on<br>
transmission time, i.e. RB1&gt;RB2&gt;RB3 for 1st TTI, RB2&gt;RB3&gt;RB1 for 2nd TTI,<br>
RB3&gt;RB1&gt;RB2 for 3rd TTI. and so on. An advantage of this method is that, whatever<br>
criterion is used, a UE can just consider one RB at a time. Thus, it can alleviate UE's<br>
complexity.<br>
[92]	II-3. Method of Allocating Amounts of Transmission Data of RBs according to a<br>
Ratio of a New Criterion by Configuring the New Criterion instead of the LCPs.<br>
[93]	In this method, amounts of transmission data are allocated to the RBs having the<br>
equal LCPs according to a ratio of a criterion. At this time, the amounts of<br>
transmission data may be allocated according to the criterion such as a BO, a PBR, an<br>
MBR, a buffer latency period of data, a TTI, and the like. Various criteria may be<br>
available. Selectively, a combination of various criteria may be used. That is, various<br>
criteria such as a BO/PBR, an MBR/PBR, and the like may be available.<br>
[94]	There are two methods based on whether the determined criterion applied to al-<br>
location of amounts of transmission data includes PBR allocation or excludes PBR al-<br>
location.<br>
[95]	FIG. 14 illustrates a method of allocating amounts of transmission data according to<br>
a ratio of a criterion except PBR allocation. First, amounts of transmission data are<br>
allocated to the extent of the PBRs of the RBs. The amounts of transmission data are<br>
allocated to the RBs with respect to the remaining radio resources according to the<br>
ratio of the criterion. Here, a BO is used as the criterion.<br>
[96]	Referring to FIG. 14, amounts of transmission data are allocated to RBs in the<br>
 <br>
descending order of LCPs to the extent of the PBRs. That is, 300 bits of the PBR1 are<br>
allocated for the RBI. Since the RB2 and the RB3 have equal LCPs, 400 bits of the<br>
PBR2 for the RB2 and 100 bits of the PBR3 for the RB3 are allocated in any order.<br>
[97]	Amounts of transmission data are firstly allocated to the extent of the PBRs of the<br>
RBs. When radio resources remains, the remaining radio resources are allocated in the<br>
descending order of the LCPs. 800 bits of the transport block having 1700 bits are<br>
allocated according to the PBRs of RBs, and 900 bits remain. Therefore, 400 bits to<br>
which all the remaining data can be transmitted are allocated to the RB1 having the<br>
highest priority. Then, remaining 500 bits are allocated to the RB2 and the RB3. At<br>
this time, since the LCPs of the RB2 and the RB3 are equal, extra radio resources of<br>
500 bits are allocated to the RB2 and the RB3 according to a ratio of BOs except the<br>
PBR allocation. That is, the RB2 has 1100 bits except the PBR2 among 1500 bits, and<br>
the RB3 has 500 bits except the PBR3 among 600 bits. Thus, a ratio of amounts of<br>
transmission data is 1100:500. When this ratio is applied to 500 bits, 344 bits and 156<br>
bits are respectively allocated to the RB2 and the RB3.<br>
[98]	Finally, in this TTI, the determined amounts of transmission data of the RBs are RB1<br>
= 700 bits, RB2 = 744 bits, and RB3 = 256 bits. The determined transmission data are<br>
canned by the one transport block.<br>
[99]	The order of filling the transport block with data of RBs depends on an embodied<br>
method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data according to a rule for de-<br>
termining amounts of data so as to show a method of determining amounts of data.<br>
[ 100] FIG. 15 illustrates a method of allocating amounts of transmission data according to<br>
a ratio of a criterion including PBR allocation. In this method, amounts of transmission<br>
data are allocated to the RBs having the equal LCPs according to a ratio of the criterion<br>
regardless of PBRs. A BO is used as the criterion.<br>
[101] Referring to FIG. 15, amounts of transmission data are allocated to RBs in the<br>
descending order of LCPs to the extent of the PBRs. That is, 300 bits of PBR1 are<br>
allocated for the RB1. Since the RB2 and the RB3 has equal LCPs, 400 bits of the<br>
PBR2 for the RB2 and 100 bits of the PBR3 for the RB3 are allocated in any order.<br>
Then, since radio resources of 900 bits remain, the remaining radio resources are<br>
allocated in the descending order of LCPs.<br>
[102] First, 400 bits to which all the remaining data can be transmitted are allocated to the<br>
RB1 having the highest priority, and remaining 500 bits are allocated to the RB2 and<br>
the RB3. At this time, the amounts of transmission data are allocated to the RB2 and<br>
the RB3 according to a ratio of the BOs. The entire radio resources which can be used<br>
by the RB2 and the RB3 are 1000 bits including 500 bits allocated to the PBRs. When<br>
the radio resources are divided according to a ratio of 1500:600, the amounts of<br>
transmission data of the RB2 and the RB3 are 714 bits and 286 bits, respectively.<br>
 <br>
When the already allocated PBR1 of 400 bits and PBR2 of 100 bits are excluded,<br>
amounts allocated to the remaining 500 bits are 314 bits and 186 bits, respectively.<br>
[103] Finally, in this TTI, the determined amount of transmission data of the RBs are RB1<br>
= 700 bits, RB2 = 714 bits, and RB3 = 286 bits. The determined transmission data are<br>
carried by the one transport block.<br>
[104] The order of filling the transport block with data of the RBs depends on an embodied<br>
method. In FIG. 10, the transport block is filled with data according to a rule for de-<br>
termining amounts of data so as to show a method of determining amounts of data.<br>
[105] Every function as described above can be performed by a processor such as a micro-<br>
processor based on software coded to perform such function, a program code, etc., a<br>
