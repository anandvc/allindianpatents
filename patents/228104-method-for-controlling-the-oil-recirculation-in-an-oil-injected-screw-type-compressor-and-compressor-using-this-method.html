				<td>METHOD FOR CONTROLLING THE OIL RECIRCULATION IN AN<br>
OIL-INJECTED SCREW-TYPE COMPRESSOR AND COMPRESSOR USING<br>
THIS METHOD<br>
This invention relates to a method for controlling the<br>
oil recirculation in an oil-injected screw-type<br>
compressor comprising a compressor element, connected<br>
thereto an inlet conduit and a pressure conduit, an oil<br>
separator in said pressure conduit, an oil recirculation<br>
conduit between said oil separator and the compressor<br>
element, in which recirculation conduit an oil cooler is<br>
installed, and a bypass bridging-over the oil cooler in<br>
the recirculation conduit, which controlling is performed<br>
by means of a thermostatic valve having a valve element<br>
which can be moved by means of a temperature-sensitive<br>
element, whereby the temperature-sensitive element<br>
measures the temperature of the recirculating oil and the<br>
valve element, if this temperature is below a certain<br>
value, opens the bypass, such that the separated oil from<br>
the oil separator can flow directly towards the<br>
compressor element without having to flow over the oil<br>
cooler and, if the temperature of the oil is above a<br>
certain value, which is higher than or egual to the<br>
aforementioned value, the valve element closes off the<br>
bypass.<br>
According to the known methods, the valve element of the<br>
thermostatic valve is in that position in which it opens<br>
the bypass, when the oil is cold, and this when the<br>
compressor is without load as well as when the compressor<br>
changes from the unloaded to the loaded status.<br>
When the oil is warmer than a well-defined temperature,<br>
then the valve element is in that position in which it<br>
closes the bypass, as a consequence of which the oil from<br><br>
the oil separator is forced to flow over the oil cooler<br>
before being injected back into the compressor element.<br>
When the compressor is running without load and thus no<br>
air is suctioned into the compressor element, the<br>
pressure in the oil separator, which latter also serves<br>
as a pressure vessel, is kept as-low as possible in order<br>
to limit the unloaded power consumption.<br>
When transiting into the loaded working condition, and<br>
thus when opening the inlet valve, the screw-type<br>
compressor element maximally suctions air which then is<br>
compressed. Due to the low pressure in the oil separator,<br>
the oil pressure at the beginning of the transition also<br>
is low.<br>
When the oil temperature is high, the bypass thus is<br>
closed, such that the oil flows over the oil cooler,<br>
which moreover causes a pressure drop, such that the oil<br>
injection pressure temporarily is particularly low.<br>
As a consequence, with these known methods high tempera-<br>
ture peaks may be created at the outlet of the compressor<br>
element.<br>
The pressure in the oil separator during the unlpaded<br>
operation of the compressor element and, thus, the<br>
consumed input, can not be chosen optimally low in order<br>
to prevent the occurrence of said temperature peaks.<br>
The invention aims at a method for controlling the<br>
recirculation of the oil, whereby the pressure in the oil<br>
separator, when the compressor element is working without<br>
load, can be kept lower, without the risk of temperature<br>
peaks at the outlet of this compressor element during the<br>
transition from unloaded to loaded operation.<br><br>
According to the invention, to this aim, during the<br>
transition from the unloaded to the loaded condition of<br>
the screw-type compressor, the influence of the<br>
temperature-sensitive element temporarily is switched off<br>
at least partially, such that the valve element<br>
temporarily takes a position in which, regardless of the<br>
temperature of the oil, at least the bypass is open and<br>
thus the recirculation of oil from the oil separator<br>
towards the compressor element temporarily takes place at<br>
least by means of this bypass.<br>
Thus, the additional pressure drop in the oil cooler<br>
temporarily is switched off, such that, notwithstanding<br>
the low pressure of the oil, there still is a sufficient<br>
injection pressure in order to avoid temperature peaks at<br>
the outlet of the compressor element.<br>
This switching-off of the influence of the temperature-<br>
sensitive element is solely of a short duration, in<br>
consideration of the fact that, under load, the pressure<br>
in the oil separator rapidly increases.<br>
When transiting from unloaded to loaded, the valve<br>
element, preferably takes a position whereby the bypass as<br>
well as the recirculation conduit are open, such that the<br>
oil temporarily can flow back to the compressor element<br>
through the bypass as well as through the oil cooler,<br>
regardless of the temperature of the oil.<br>
The temporarily, at least partially, switching-off the<br>
effect of the temperature-sensitive element can take<br>
place by realizing a part of the wall of the thermostatic<br>
valve, against which the temperature-sensitive element<br>
normally is situated, as a piston of a pneumatically<br>
controllable piston mechanism, whereby the temperature-<br>
sensitive element can expand without moving the valve<br><br>
element, for example, by pushing away this piston, and<br>
whereby, for example, the pressure in the oil separator<br>
and the control pressure for operating a controlled inlet<br>
valve in the inlet conduit are used as control pressures.<br>
The invention also relates to an oil-injected screw-type<br>
compressor which is suitable for being controlled<br>
according to the method described in the aforegoing.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates to an oil-injected<br>
screw-type compressor comprising a screw-type compressor<br>
element, connected thereto an inlet conduit and a<br>
pressure conduit, an oil separator in said pressure<br>
conduit, an oil recirculation conduit between said oil<br>
separator and the compressor element, in which<br>
recirculation conduit an oil cooler is arranged, and a<br>
bypass bridging-over the oil cooler in the recirculation<br>
conduit and which can be closed off by means of a valve<br>
element of a thermostatic valve with a valve element that<br>
can be moved by a temperature-sensitive element situated<br>
in the recirculation conduit, and with as a characteris-<br>
tic that the screw-type compressor comprises a control<br>
system which, when transiting from the unloaded to the<br>
loaded condition, temporarily switches off the effect of<br>
the temperature-sensitive element onto the valve element<br>
of the thermostatic valve at least partially, such that<br>
during this transition, the valve element is in a<br>
position whereby at least the bypass is open, regardless<br>
of the temperature of the oil.<br>
The bypass can be limited to a passage between a part of<br>
the recirculation conduit situated between the oil<br>
separator and the oil cooler, and a part of the<br>
recirculation conduit situated between the oil cooler and<br>
the compressor element.<br><br>
In a particular form of embodiment of the invention, the<br>
valve element of the thermostatic valve is situated in<br>
the bypass as well as in the recirculation conduit,<br>
upstream from the bypass, such that, in one position, it<br>
simultaneously opens the bypass and closes off the part<br>
of the recirculation conduit situated between the outlet<br>
of the oil cooler and the bypass, in another position<br>
simultaneously closes off the bypass and further opens<br>
the aforementioned part of the recirculation conduit, and<br>
preferably in the first-mentioned position and/or in an<br>
intermediate position opens the bypass as well as opens<br>
the aforementioned part of the recirculation conduit.<br>
The valve element takes up the first-mentioned position,<br>
amongst others, when, during the transition from the<br>
unloaded to the loaded condition, the working of the<br>
thermostatic valve is switched off at least partially.<br>
The aforementioned control system may comprise a piston<br>
mechanism, the piston of which, in a well-defined posi-<br>
tion, forms a stop for the temperature-sensitive element.<br>
When this piston is freely movable, then the temperature-<br>
sensitive element of the thermostatic valve can freely<br>
change its length, and the effect of this thermostatic<br>
valve thus is switched off at least partially.<br>
With the intention of better showing the characteristics<br>
of the invention, hereafter, as an example without any<br>
limitative character, a preferred form of embodiment of a<br>
method for controlling the oil recirculation in an oil-<br>
injected screw—type compressor and screw-type compressor<br>
controlled in this manner, according to the invention, is<br>
described, with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>
Figure 1 schematically represents a screw-type<br><br>
compressor according to the invention, during cold<br>
starting;<br>
figure 2, in cross-section and at a larger scale,<br>
represents a practical embodiment of the part<br>
indicated by F2 in figure 1;<br>

gure 1, however, during the normal regime operation,<br>
either loaded or unloaded, when the oil is warm;<br>
figure 4, in cross-section and at a larger scale,<br>
represents a practical embodiment analogous to that<br>
from figure 2, of the part indicated by F4 in figure<br>
3;<br>
figure 5 represents the screw-type compressor during<br>
the transition from unloaded to loaded operation,<br>
when the oil still is warm;<br>
figure 6, in cross-section and at a larger scale,<br>
represents a practical embodiment analogous to that<br>
of figures 2 and 4, of the part indicated by F6 in<br>
figure 5;<br>
figure 7 represents a cross-section analogous to that<br>
from figures 2, 4 and 6, however, relating to another<br>
status of the screw-type compressor.<br>
The screw-type compressor represented in the figures<br>
comprises a compressor element 1 comprising a housing 2<br>
surrounding a rotor chamber 3 in which two mutually<br>
cooperating screw-shaped rotors 4 are installed. The<br>
compressor element 1 is driven by a motor, not<br>
represented in the figures.<br>
At the inlet side, an inlet conduit 5 gives out in the<br>
rotor chamber 3, in which conduit 5 air filters 6 and a<br>
controlled inlet valve 7 are provided, whereas at the<br>
outlet side, a pressure conduit 8, by means of an outlet<br>
valve 9 which, for example, is a return valve, connects<br>
to the rotor chamber 3.<br><br>
In the pressure conduit 8, successively an oil separator<br>
10, an air cooler 11, and a water separator 12 are<br>
arranged.<br>
In the oil separator 10, there is a vessel 13 which is<br>
provided with an outlet 14 at the top. Opposite to outlet<br>
14, a filter 15 is installed in the vessel 13, and a<br>
minimum pressure valve 16 is installed in the outlet 14.<br>
The major part of the oil is collected in the lower part<br>
of the vessel 13, and the underside of vessel 13 is<br>
connected to an injection point of the compressor element<br>
1 by means of a recirculation conduit 17.<br>
In this recirculation conduit 17 for the oil, successive-<br>
ly an oil cooler 18, an oil filter 19 and a controlled<br>
oil valve 20 are provided.<br>
For control, the oil valve 20, by means of a control<br>
conduit 21, is in connection with the outlet of the<br>
compressor element 1.<br>
By means of a conduit 22, the interior of the filter 15<br>
is in connection with the interior of the rotor chamber 3<br>
for recirculating the oil collected at the bottom of the<br>
filter 15.<br>
The oil cooler 18 and the air cooler 11 are cooled by a<br>
common fan and have radiators which are united to one<br>
single block.<br>
The oil filter 19 is provided on the housing 23 of a<br>
thermostatic valve 24. This valve 24 comprises a space 25<br>
in which a valve element 26 is situated and a space 28<br>
separated therefrom by a partition 27.<br><br>
The space 25 is in connection with the inlet of an oil<br>
filter 19 placed on the housing 23 and thus is situated<br>
in the recirculation conduit 17. This space 25 forms the<br>
connection between said oil filter 19 and the part 17B of<br>
the recirculation conduit 17 situated between the outlet<br>
of the oil cooler 18 and the housing 23. The connection<br>
of the £&gt;art 17B tio the space 25 forms a passage 29 which<br>
can be closed off by the valve element 26.<br>
A bypass having the form of a passage 30 from the part<br>
17C of the recirculation conduit 17, situated between the<br>
oil separator 10 and the inlet of the oil cooler 18, to<br>
the space 25 gives out into the space 25. This passage<br>
30, too, can be closed off by the valve element 26.<br>
The bypass for the oil bridges-over the oil cooler 18,<br>
and through this bypass or passage 30, oil can flow<br>
directly from the oil separator 10 to the oil filter 19<br>
and further to the compressor element 1 without passing<br>
through oil cooler 18.<br>
When the valve element 26 closes off the passage 30 and<br>
thus the bypass, it opens the passage 29, and reverse,<br>
when the valve element 26 opens the passage 30, it<br>
closes off the passage 29. In an intermediate position,<br>
the valve element 26 leaves open both passages 29 and 30.<br>
The space 28 is in connection with, on one hand, the<br>
outlet of the filter element of the oil filter 19 and, on<br>
the other hand, the part 17A of the recirculation conduit<br>
17 situated between the oil filter 19 and the oil valve<br>
20.<br>
As is represented more detailed in figures 2, 4, 6 and 7,<br>
the thermostatic valve 24 can be composed as follows:<br><br>
The valve element 26 is a bush which is axially movable<br>
in a bore 25A which forms part of the space 25 and into<br>
which ring-shaped chambers 31 and 32 give out, which<br>
respectively form part of the passages 29 and 30 to which<br>
the conduit parts 17B and 17C connect.<br>
The valve element 26 is provided with a slot 33 extending<br>
over a part of the circumference parallel to the chambers<br>
31 and 32 and being smaller than the width of the<br>
chambers 31 and 32 in axial direction.<br>
A temperature-sensitive element 34 is axially installed<br>
in the valve element 26, said element 34 having a base 35<br>
and a finger 36 moving out of it when the temperature<br>
increases.<br>
Normally, the finger 36 cooperates with a stop which is<br>
movable and which, in the represented example, is formed<br>
by a piston 37 which is situated in the prolongation of<br>
the bore 25A.<br>
This piston 37 forms part of a control system 38 which<br>
shall be described in the following.<br>
The base 35 is attached to the valve element 26 by the<br>
intermediary of a disk ring 39.<br>
A spring 40, which is provided between said disk ring 39<br>
and a collar 25B of the wall of the bore 25A, pushes the<br>
valve element 26 into the direction of the housing 41 of<br>
the control system 38.<br>
Said piston 37 consists of a plunger 37A fitting into an<br>
opening 42 in the housing 41, and a head 37B with larger<br>
diameter situated in a chamber 43 in the housing 41.<br><br>
At the plunger side of the head 37B, the chamber 43, by<br>
means of a duct 44, is in connection with the atmosphere.<br>
At the other side of the head 37B, the chamber 43, by<br>
means of a duct 45, connects to a conduit 46 ending up in<br>
the vessel 13.<br>
This duct 45 can be put into connection with the<br>
atmosphere by means of an auxiliary control, formed by a<br>
relief valve 47. Said relief valve 47 comprises a valve<br>
body 48 having a hollow part provided with radial<br>
openings 49 in its wall, which, for one position of this<br>
valve body 48, connects the duct 45, through the interior<br>
of this last-mentioned valve body 48, to the atmosphere.<br>
A part of the duct 45 forms a ring-shaped duct 45A around,<br>
the bore 50 for this valve body 48, and for said position<br>
of the valve body 48, the openings 49 give out onto this<br>
ring-shaped duct 45A.<br>
Whereas the interior of the valve body 48 at one<br>
extremity, by means of a chamber 51 and a duct 52 in the<br>
housing 41, is in connection with the atmosphere, the<br>
hollow valve body 48 is closed off at the other extremity<br>
and has a piston-forming part 48A which is movable in a<br>
cylinder-forming chamber 53.<br>
The most outwardly situated extremity of this chamber 53<br>
connects, by means of a duct 54, to a control conduit 55<br>
which is in connection with the control conduit 55A for<br>
supplying the control pressure PI to the inlet valve 7.<br>
By means of a not represented duct, the other extremity<br>
of the chamber 53 is in connection with the atmosphere.<br>
In the chamber 51, two springs 56 and 57 are arranged<br>
which counteract the movement of the valve bodv 48 under<br><br>
the influence of this control pressure P1, to wit a<br>
relatively weak spring 56 between this valve body 48 and<br>
the end of a tubular element 58, and a stronger spring 47<br>
which is provided around the tubular element 58 between a<br>
collar of the tubular element 58 and the extremity of the<br>
chamber 51.<br>
The control of the recirculation of oil from the vessel<br>
13 to the compressor element 1 takes place as follows:<br>
When the screw-type compressor is at rest, the inlet<br>
valve 7 is closed and there is no control pressure P1.<br>
The part 48A of the valve body 48 is situated against the<br>
extremity of the chamber 53, and the openings 49 are.<br>
closed off by the housing 41.<br>
The pressure P2 in the oil separator 10 is situated<br>
minimum 0,6 bar above atmospheric pressure, such that the<br>
piston 37 is pushed into withdrawn position, whereby its<br>
end surface forming a stop for the finger 36 is situated<br>
in the plane of the end of the bore 25A, as represented<br>
in figures 2 and 4.<br>
When the oil flowing from the oil separator 10 back to<br>
the compressor element 1 has a temperature which is lower<br>
than a well-defined value, as, for example, with a first<br>
start before the compressor is put under load, then the<br>
finger 36 is slid maximally into the base 35, this is<br>
until the widened extremity of the finger 36 is situated<br>
against the base 35, as represented in figure 2. Hereby,<br>
the valve element 26 is in the position in which the<br>
passage 29 is closed off and the passage 30 is open.<br>
The oil flows from the oil separator 10, through the<br>
passage 30 and thus without being cooled in the oil<br>
cooler 18, to the compressor element 1, as represented by<br><br>
arrows in figures 1 and 2.<br>
When the temperature of the oil increases, then the<br>
temperature-sensitive element 34 becomes longer and the<br>
finger 36 is pushed out of the base 35, which means that,<br>
considered that the piston 37 does not change its<br>
position by the pressure P1, the base 35 is moved away<br>
from the piston 37. By means of the disk ring 39, the<br>
base 36 takes along the valve element 26, against the<br>
effect of spring 40. At a well-defined moment, this valve<br>
element 26 will leave open both passages 29 and 30.<br>
Once the oil has reached its normal operation<br>
temperature, then the finger 36 is slid out maximally,<br>
and the condition represented in figures 3 and 4 is<br>
obtained. The valve element 26 closes off the passage 30<br>
entirely, whereas the passage 29 is maximally open. All<br>
of the oil flows back through oil cooler 18, as<br>
represented by arrows in figures 3 and 4.<br>
At the moment that the control of the compressor gives a<br>
signal for the transition from unloaded to loaded<br>
condition, in other words, when compressed air has to be<br>
delivered, the pressure P2 prevailing in the oil<br>
separator 10, by means of control conduit 55A, is<br>
immediately used as control pressure PI of the inlet<br>
valve 7. In the chamber 53, thus a control pressure Pl,<br>
prevails which is equal to the pressure P2 in the oil<br>
separator 10. This control pressure PI is sufficiently<br>
high in order to move the valve body 48 against the force,<br>
of the weakest spring 56, however, is insufficient in<br>
order to equally compress the stronger spring 57.<br>
Thereby, the valve body 48 takes a position as<br>
represented in figure 6, whereby the openings 49 give out<br>
onto the duct 45.<br><br>
Consequently, the chamber 43 temporarily is in connection<br>
with the atmosphere and the piston 37 in fact is free,,<br>
and the temperature-sensitive element 34 can push the<br>
piston 37 away. Under the influence of the spring 40, the<br>
valve element 26, as represented in figure 6, will be<br>
pushed against the end of bore 25A, whereby the passage<br>
29 as well as the passage 30 are open and the oil thus<br>
can flow through the oil cooler 18 as well as through the<br>
bypass or passage 30. At that moment, the inlet valve 7<br>
still is closed.<br>
From figure 6. it is obvious that the valve element 26<br>
takes said position regardless whether the oil is cold or<br>
warm. When the temperature-sensitive element 34, as a<br>
result of the warm oil, has a maximum length, it simply<br>
pushes the piston 37 further into the chamber 43, as<br>
represented in figure 6.<br>
The pressure P2 in the oil separator 10 increases<br>
continuously until it is high enough to open the inlet<br>
valve 7. At this stage, the risk is the largest that<br>
temperature peaks occur in the compressor element 1<br>
because of insufficient oil lubrication as a result of<br>
too low an oil pressure P2. Due to the fact that the oil,<br>
as represented by arrows in figure 6, can flow through<br>
the passage 30 and the chamber 25 directly to the<br>
compressor element 1, the pressure drop in the oil cooler<br>
18 is avoided, as a result of which a higher pressure is<br>
obtained at the inlet of the oil valve 20 and whereby<br>
thus a better oil lubrication is obtained during said<br>
transition stage from unloaded to loaded operation of the<br>
screw-type compressor.<br>
After opening the inlet valve 7, the pressure P2 in the<br>
oil separator 10 and thus also the control pressure P2<br>
increases more rapidly. When the control pressure P1 is<br><br>
sufficiently high, the valve body 48, against the effect<br>
of the stronger spring 57, is moved further up into the<br>
position represented in figure 7. The passages 49 then<br>
are closed off by the housing 41.<br>
The part of the chamber 43 onto which the duct 45 gives<br>
out, then no longer is in connection with the atmosphere,<br>
but is at the pressure P2.<br>
Thereby, the piston 37 is pushed into its position<br>
represented in figure 7, Whereby the plunger 37A fills<br>
the opening 42 and forms a stop in the plane of the end<br>
of the bore 25A.<br>
The pressure of the oil in the chamber 25, however, also<br>
is approximately equal to P2, however, this pressure is<br>
exerted onto a smaller surface, to wit that of the<br>
plunger 37A, than the surface of the head 37B.<br>
As the oil is at operation temperature, the finger 36 of<br>
the temperature-sensitive element 34 is maximally pushed<br>
out, as a result of which the valve element 26, against<br>
the effect of the spring 40, is brought into the position<br>
represented in figure 7.<br>
This valve element 26 then closes off the passage 30,<br>
whereas the passage 29 is open. The oil flows as is<br>
represented by arrows in figures 3 and 7, this is through<br>
the part 17C of the conduit 17 to the oil cooler 18 and<br>
from there through the part 17B and through the passage<br>
29 to the filter 29.<br>
When the load of the compressor, which by now is warmed<br>
up, stops, then first the inlet valve 7 is closed and the<br>
control pressure PI drops below said minimum value, as a<br>
result of which the valve body 48, by the springs 56 and<br><br>
57, is pushed back to the position represented in figures<br>
3 and 4.<br>
The pressure P2 in the oil separator and thus also the<br>
pressure of the oil effecting on the piston 37, drops to<br>
a minimum value, which nevertheless still is sufficient<br>
for keeping the piston 37 pushed in, such that the<br>
condition from figure 4 is obtained and the warm oil, as<br>
represented in figure 3, must flow through oil cooler 18.<br>
When the compressor again changes from the unloaded to<br>
the loaded condition, the process described heretofore in<br>
connection with such transition is repeated.<br>
Thus, this means that with each transition from the<br>
unloaded to the loaded condition of the compressor, when<br>
the oil pressure is low, the passage 30, as represented<br>
in figure 6, is temporarily opened and thus the oil<br>
substantially can flow through the bypass formed by this<br>
passage 30 directly from the oil separator 10 to the<br>
filter 19 and from there to the oil valve 20, whereby an<br>
additional pressure drop over the oil cooler 18 is<br>
avoided.<br>
In that during the transition, as also represented in<br>
figure 6, passage 29 is open, too, the oil also will<br>
partially, however, to a lesser extent, flow through the<br>
oil cooler 18, as a result of which, at the end of said<br>
transition phase, when the passage 30 suddenly is closed<br>
off and the maximum oil flow rate must flow through the<br>
oil cooler 18, the oil flow rate through this oil cooler<br>
18 will increase less sudden and the transition thus will<br>
take place at a steadier pace.<br>
As with each transition from an unloaded to a loaded<br>
condition, each time the oil cooler 18 is bypassed, the<br><br>
pressure drop in the oil is smaller, as a result of which<br>
the oil is injected into the compressor element 1 at a<br>
higher pressure and consequently a better lubrication is<br>
obtained, such that the risk of temperature peaks at the<br>
outlet of the compressor element 1 diminishes.<br>
According- to the same argumentation, it can be stated<br>
that during unloaded operation, the oil pressure in the<br>
oil separator 10 may drop lower than in a classical<br>
compressor without control system 38 according to the<br>
invention, without the risk of such damaging temperature<br>
peaks.<br>
The invention is in no way limited to the form of<br>
embodiment described in the aforegoing and represented in<br>
the accompanying drawings, however, such method for<br>
controlling the oil recirculation in an oil-injected<br>
screw-type compressor and such controlled screw—type<br>
compressor can be realized in various variants, without<br>
leaving the scope of the invention, as determined by the<br>
