				<td>Modified plant gums for preparations of active ingredients<br>
The present invention relates to modified plant gums, a process for the manufacture thereof, as well as to compositions containing active ingredients, preferably fat-soluble active ingredients, and/or colorants in a matrix based on these modified plant gums and to a process for preparing these compositions.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the compositions of this invention for the enrichment, fortification and/or for the coloration of food, beverages, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions comprising a plant gum, where the protein part has been hydrolysed up to a degree of 30% and/or the polysaccha-ride part has been hydrolysed up to a degree of 50%, and a (fat soluble) active ingredient and/or a colorant, especially a carotenoid, to a process for preparing these compositions and the use of these compositions as additives for the enrichment, fortification and/or for the coloration of food, beverages, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions; and to food, beverages, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions containing such compositions.<br>
If plant gum as known in the prior art is used as matrix for compositions containing (fat-soluble) active ingredients and/or colorants, the physical parameters of such obtained com-<br>
positions often differ due to quality differences in the plant gum. Therefore, a need exists for compositions, wherein the quality of the plant gum is standardized or even improved.<br>
This need is fulfilled by compositions comprising<br>
i) at least a modified plant gum, optionally with a protein content and preferably obtainable<br>
by the process of the present invention as described below,<br>
ii) at least an active ingredient, especially a fat-soluble active ingredient, and/or a colorant,<br>
and<br>
iii) optionally at least an adjuvant and/or an excipient.<br>
Such compositions are used for the enrichment, fortification and/or coloration of food, beverage, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions; said use being a further aspect of the invention. Moreover, the invention is related to food, beverage, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions containing such compositions.<br>
The components i) to iii) are in more detail described in the following.<br>
Component i)<br>
The term "plant gum composition" denotes any composition comprising plant gums as obtainable from natural plant gum sources. Examples of such plant gum compositions are mixtures of various gums from.different sources .as-well-as .plant .gum-compositions con-taming further hydrocolloids, such as starch, modified starch, maltodextrin, etc. and optionally any typical emulsifier (as co-emulgator), such as mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, lecithins, sorbitan monostearate, and plant fibre or sugar.<br>
As used herein, the term "plant gum" denotes a plant gum as it is found either in natural products such as exudates of plants or obtained by artificially wounding the plants ("tears of gum"), cleaning the exudates from dust by washing and drying the aqueous solutions or suspensions of the exudates by spray-drying and which has not been modified by enzymatic treatment or chemical derivatisation. However, the term "plant gum" is understood to include products which have undergone a fractionation step, such as filtration or cen-trifugation, products which have been thermally treated in a dry form, gums, the aqueous<br>
suspensions or solutions of which have been heated, and gums that have been extracted from plants.<br>
Plant gums are polysaccharide based hydrocolloids, which can have a protein content of about 
The polysaccharide chains of plant gums contain various sugar units, e.g. Ce-sugars such as galactose, mannose and glucose, Cs-sugars such as arabinose, xylose, Ce-sugar acids such as glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid, Ce-desoxysugars such as rhamnose and fucose.<br>
As a source for the plant gum all known gums, such as guar gum, carob gum (carob seed gum, carob bean gum, locust bean gum), tragacanth gum, tara gum, karaya gum, gum acacia (gum arabic), ghatti gum, cherry gum, apricot gum, tamarind gum, mesquite gum, larch gum, psyllium, or fenugreek gum can be used. Furthermore gums derived from microorganisms (bacteria, algae) such as xanthan gum (xanthum gum), seaweed gum, gellan gum, agar gum, or carrageenan can be used. For the purpose of the present invention, preparations of gum acacia (gum arabic) from Acacia Senegal or Acacia seyal, especially in powder form, with a protein content of preferably about 0.5 to about 3 weight-%, based on the totaLweieht of the plant gum,..are preferred.<br>
Plant gums e.g. from Acacia Senegal are readily commercially available in the form of powders such as the product Quick Gum from the company Alfred L. Wolff. (Hamburg, Germany).<br>
The term "modified plant gum" refers to plant gums which have been submitted to hydrolysis to degrade the polysaccharide and, where appropriate, the protein portion. Preferably the modified plant gum is a plant gum whose protein part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 30%, preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 30%, more preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 10%, most preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 5%. In certain embodiments of the present invention modified plant gums are used, the protein part of which is hydrolysed between 0.05 and 1%. In other preferred embodiments<br>
the modified plant gum is a plant gum whose polysaccharide part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 50%, preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 20%, more preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 5%. One may also use modified plant gums whose protein part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 30% (preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 30%, more preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 10%, most preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 5%) and whose polysaccharide part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 50% (preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 20%, more preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 5%).<br>
Component u")<br>
The term "active ingredients" as used herein encompasses "fat-soluble active ingredients"<br>
as well as "water-soluble active ingredients". Preferred are "fat-soluble active ingredients".<br>
The term "fat-soluble active ingredient" as used herein encompasses fat soluble vitamins and functionally related compounds which can be used for enrichment or fortification of food, beverages, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Examples of such fat soluble vitamins are the vitamins of the groups A, D, E or K or derivatives thereof such as their acetates, e.g. vitamin A acetate or tocopherol acetate, or their longer chain fatty acid esters, e.g. vitamin A palmitate or tocopherol palmitate.<br>
Examples of functionally related compounds are e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or derivatives thereof, triglycerides rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapen-taenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DBA) or y-linolenic acid (GLA), or coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10). Also included are fat soluble sun filters, such as UV-A andUV-B filters used in sun care and cosmetic preparations.<br>
The term "colorant" as used herein comprises a carotene or structurally related polyene compound which can be used as a colorant for food, beverages, animal feed, cosmetics or pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Examples of such carotenes or structurally related polyene compounds are carotenoids such as a-carotene, (3-carotene, S'-apo-p-carotenal, 8-apo-p-carotenoic acid esters such as<br>
the ethyl ester, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin or crocetin, a- or P-zeacarotene or mixtures thereof. The preferred carotenoid is [3-carotene.<br>
Therefore, a preferred aspect of the invention deals with compositions containing at least a modified plant gum and p-carotene as colorant. These compositions, when dissolved, dispersed or diluted in/with water to a final P-carotene concentration of 10 ppm are typically characterised by ultraviolet/visible-spectroscopy using deionised water as reference. At a sample thickness of 1 cm the dispersions show an extinction of at least 0.2 (preferably above 1.0) absorbanee units at the wavelength of maximum optical density in the range of 400 to 600 nm. This is equivalent to a formal extinction coefficient of P-carotene in aqueous dispersion E(l%, 1cm) of 200 to 1000 (preferably &gt;1000).<br>
It is understood that the above named substances of the categories "fat-soluble active ingredient" and "colorant" can also be used as mixtures within the compositions of the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the amount of the modified plant gum i) is from about 0.5 to about 60.0 weight-%, the amount of the (fat-soluble) active ingredient and/or colorant ii) is from about 0.1 to about 80.0 weight-%, and the amount of the adjuvant and/or excipient iii) is from about 10 to about 95 weight-%, preferably from about 60 to about 90 weight-%, based on the total amount of the composition.<br>
Component iii)<br>
Suitably, the compositions of the present invention (further) contain one or more excipi-ents and/or adjuvants selected from the group consisting of monosaccharides, disaccha-rides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, glycerol, triglycerides (different from the triglycerides rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids mentioned above), water-soluble antioxi-dants and fat-soluble antioxidants.<br>
Examples of mono- and disaccharides which may be present in the compositions of the present invention are sucrose, invert sugar, xylose glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, saccharose and sugar alcohols.<br>
Examples of the oligo- and polysaccharides are starch, modified starch and starch hydro-lysates, e.g. dextrins and maltodextrins, especially those having the range of 5 to 65 dextrose equivalents (DE), and glucose syrup, especially such having the range of 20 to 95 DE. The term "dextrose equivalent" (DE) denotes the degree of hydrolysis and is a measure of the amount of reducing sugar calculated as D-glucose based on dry weight; the scale is based on native starch having a DE close to 0 and glucose having a DE of 100.<br>
The triglyceride is suitably a vegetable oil or fat, preferably corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, cotton seed oil, olive oil or coconut oil.<br>
Solid compositions may in addition contain an anti-caking agent, such as silicic acid or tricalcium phosphate and the like, and up to about 10 weight-%, as a rule about 2 to about 5 weight-%, of water.<br>
The water-soluble antioxidant may be for example ascorbic acid or a salt thereof, preferably sodium ascorbate, watersoluble polyphenols such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycon, epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) or extracts of rosemary or olives.<br>
The fat-soluble antioxidant may be for example a tocopherol, e.g. dl-a-tocopherol (i.e. synthetic tocopherol), d-a-tocopherol (i.e. natural tocopherol), J3- or y-tocopherol, or a : mixture of two or more'of these; butyiated hydroxytoluene (BHT);-butylateti hydroxyani- • sole (BHA); ethoxyquin, propyl gallate; tert. butyl hydroxyquinoline; or 6-ethoxy-l,2-dihydroxy-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline (EMQ), or an ascorbic acid ester of a fatty acid, preferably ascorbyl paknitate or stearate.<br>
Depending on the pH of the aqueous matrix solution the ascorbic acid ester of a fatty acid, particularly ascorbyl palmitate or stearate, may alternatively be added to the water phase.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be solid compositions, i.e. stable, water-soluble or -dispersible powders, or they may be liquid compositions, i.e. aqueous colloidal solutions or oil-in-water dispersions of the aforementioned powders. The stabilised oil-in-water dispersions, which may be oil-in-water emulsions or may feature a mixture of sus-<br>
pended, i.e. solid, particles and emulsified, i.e. liquid, droplets, may be prepared by the methods described below or by an analogous manner.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is concerned with stable compositions in powder form comprising one or more (fat-soluble) active ingredients and/or one or more colorants in a matrix of a modified plant gum composition.<br>
Typically, a powder composition according to the present invention comprises<br><br>
(Table Removed)   In still another aspect of the invention, the compositions according to the invention may additionally contain proteins (of plant or animal origin) or hydrolysed proteins that act as protective colloids, e.g. proteins from soy or lupin, or hydrolysed proteins from soy or lupin. Such additional proteins may be present in the formulations of the invention in an amount of from 1 to 50 weight-% based on the total amount of protein in the formulation.<br><br>
In a further aspect of the invention the modified plant gum is cross-linked with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of reducing sugars, proteins including protein hydrolysates, peptides, glycoproteins or glycopeptides - dependent on the structure of the modified plant gum, because intra- and/or intermolecular cross-linking is achieved between a sugar-unit and an amino acid-unit.<br>
In a preferred composition of the invention the modified (= hydrolysed; see below) plant gum has a protein content of from about 0.5 to about 6 weight-%, more preferably of from about 0.5 to about 4 weight-%, based on the total weight of the plant gum, and at least one type of cross-linking selected from the group consisting of cross-linking between the protein part of the modified plant gum with an added reducing sugar, cross-linking between the sugar/polysaccharide part of the modified plant gum with an added protem/peptide, cross- linking between the modified plant gum and glycoproteins or glycopeptides, and intra- and/or intermolecular cross-Unking between the protein part and the sugar/polysaccharide part of the modified plant gum is present.<br>
For the following see also step IX) below.<br>
Such compositions with a cross-linked modified plant gum can be obtained by submitting mixtures additionally containing a reducing sugar, e.g. glucose, fructose, saccharose or xylose or a protein, peptide, glycoprotein or glycopeptide, to heat-treatment to cause cross-'linfcmg'Df the -sugar &gt;with the protein insa-Maillard type'reacti-tby.tkeiimally. treatment, preferably at temperatures from about 30 to about 160°C, more preferably at temperatures form about 70 to about 100°C, most preferably at temperatures from about 80 to about 90°C.<br>
The term "protein" hereby also encompasses "protein hydrolysates".<br>
Cross-linking of the protein-containing plant gums with various proteins, protein hydrolysates, peptides, glycoproteins, or glycopeptides can also be achieved by treatment with cross-linking enzymes (acyltransferases, EC 2.3, e.g. transglutaminase, EC 2.3.2.13, pro-tein-glutamine:Y-glutamyltransferase), i.e. by enzymatically treatment, conveniently carried out at temperatures from about 0 to about 70°C, preferably at temperatures from about 20 to about 40°C.<br><br>
Enzymatic cross-linking results in stable protein-containing polysaccharide networks, in the case of a transglutaminase by the formation of £-(Y-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bonds. The use of glutamyl- and lysyl-containing proteins, protein hydrolysates, peptides, glyco-proteins, or glycopeptides is preferred for the enzymatic cross-linking.<br>
Both techniques, heat-treatment to cause cross-linking of the sugar with the protein in a Maillard type reaction and enzymatic cross-linking can be used for the incorporation of lipophilic moieties and can be carried out either in a dried form of the composition, or in an aqueous solution or suspension. The enzymatic cross-linking is preferably carried out in an aqueous solution or suspension.<br>
Manufacture of component i), the modified plant gum<br>
The modified plant gum can be manufactured by a process comprising the following steps:<br>
A)	preparing an aqueous solution or suspension of a plant gum having a dry mass con<br>
tent of from about 0.1 to about 60 weight-%, based on the total amount of the aque<br>
ous solution of suspension;<br>
B)	hydrolysing the plant gum solution or suspension of step a) until the desired degree<br><br>
C)	optionally fractionating the hydrolysate of step b);<br>
D)	optionally converting the optionally fractionated hydroysate into a solid form.<br>
Details of this process are discussed in the following.<br>
Step A)<br>
In step A) preferably an aqueous solution or suspension of a plant gum (as defined above)<br>
having a dry mass content of from about 5 to about 20 weight-% is prepared.<br><br>
Step B)<br>
Preferably the hydrolysis in step B) is achieved by adjusting the pH of the plant gum solution or suspension to a value of between about 2 and about 10, more preferably to a value of between about 2 and about 9, most preferably to a value of between about 4 and about 8. This is done by the addition of any organic and/or inorganic acid or base. Preferably such acid or base has a concentration of about 0.1 to 5 M, preferably of about 0.5 to about 2 M. Examples of organic acids are acetic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid and ascorbic acid.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid (preferred), sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid.<br>
Examples of inorganic bases are (earth) alkali hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide (preferred), potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide.<br>
The hydrolysis is carried out until the desired degree of hydrolysis is reached. In the case of the hydrolysis of a plant gum with a protein part, the desired degree of hydrolysis of the protein part is up to 30%, preferably from about 1 to about 30%, more preferably from about 1 to about 10%, most preferably from about 1 to about 5%, In certain embodiments of the present invention it is preferred to hydrolyse the protein part of the plant gum to a degree of between 0.05 and 1%. This degree of hydrolysis can be determined in a manner taiowfi*to those-skillecUn the art, .e.g. as described-by Petersen, !&gt;.„ Nielsen,JP.1$,, jQamb-mann C., Determination of the Degree of Hydrolysis (DH) based on OPA Reaction, ED-9512723 Novo Nordisk A/S, Dec. 1995; Frister, H., Meisel, H., Schlimme, E., OPA method modified by use of N,N-dimethyl-2-mercaptoethylammonium chloride as thiol component, Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 330 (1988) 631.<br>
If a plant gum with a low content of protein such as gum acacia (gum Arabic) from Acacia Senegal or Acacia seyal is used and the degree of hydrolysis is low it was found that a modified OPA method where the correction factors a and |3 were determined experimentally as described in example 7 gives more exact results of determining the degree of hydrolysis.<br><br>
In other preferred embodiments the modified plant gum is a plant gum whose polysaccha-ride part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 50%, preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 20%, more preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 5%. The relative degree of hydrolysis (relative to the polysaccharide part) can be determined by osmolality (W. Dzwokak and S. Ziajka, Journal of food science, 1999, 64 (3) 393-395; see also example 9). One may also hydrolyse the plant gums in such a way that the protein part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 30% (preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 30%, more preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 10%, most preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 5%) and that the polysaccharide part is hydrolysed up to a degree of about 50% (preferably to a degree of from about 0.05 to about 20%, more preferably to a degree of from about 1 to about 5%),<br>
Step B) is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 5 to about 120°C, more preferably from about 5 to about 70°C, most preferably from about 20 to about 55°,C.<br>
When step B) is carried out at a temperature of from about 5 to about 70°C in a preferred embodiment of the invention a hydrolase is added and after the desired degree of hydrolysis is achieved the hydrolase is inactivated.<br>
The hydrolase (EC 3; see http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EG3/) may be selected from the group consisting of proteases (EC 3.4), glycosylases (EC 3.2) and their ^mixtures,,.-<br>
The hydrolases can be from fruit, animal origin, bacteria or fungi. The hydrolase may have endo-activity and/or exo-activity. Therefore, enzyme-preparations of endo- and exo-proteases may be used as well as enzyme preparations of endo- and exo-glycosylases or any of their mixtures. Preferably the glycosylases have pectolytic and/or hemicelluloytic activity. Usually the hydrolases show also unknown side activities, but which are not critical for the manufacture of the desired product.<br>
Proteases for use in the process of the invention are available from the suppliers No-vozymes, Genencor, AB-Enzymes, DSM Food Specialities Amano, etc. Preferred proteases are those of bacterial or fungal origin, e.g. from Bacillus licheniformes orAspergillus oryzae. Enzyme preparations such as Alcalase or Havourzyme as obtainable from the firm<br><br>
Novozymes may be used. An example of a protease produced from Carica papaya, a plant, i.e. an enzyme of fruit origin, is the commercially available Collupilin® of DSM Food Beverages, Delft, Netherlands.<br>
Enzymes such as pectinases for use in the process of the invention are available from the suppliers, Novozymes, Genencor, AB-Enzymes, DSM Food Specialities etc. Preferred enzymes are those of fungal origin, e.g. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus aculeatus orAsper-gillus oryzae. Enzyme preparations such as Shearzyme or Pectinex as obtainable from the firm Novozymes may be used. An enzyme produced from Aspergillus aculeatus is e.g. the commercially available Peelzym® of Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark.<br>
Examples of glycosylases are the commercially available enzyme preparations from the suppliers Novozymes, Genencor, AB-Enzymes, DSM Food Specialities, Amano, etc.<br>
The hydrolase is added to provide a concentration of from about 0.01 to about 10 weight-%, preferably of from about 0.1 to about 1 weight-%, based on the dry weight of the plant gum. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the enzyme is added at once. The enzymatic hydrolysis may also be carried out stepwise. For instance, the hydrolase or a mixture of hydrolases is added to the incubation batch in an amount of e.g. 1 % whereupon, e.g. after 5 to 10 minutes (at a temperature of 35 °C) further hydrolase or a mixture of hydrolases which may by the same or different from the first added hydrolase or 4aiiftiare%f fiydrolaseg%'added, feig.'in an amount 'of 2:!% whereupon the ineabatron batch is hydrolysed at 35°C for 10 minutes enzyme preparations of endo- and exo- glycosylases or any of their mixtures. The hydrolases can be from fruit, animal origin, bacteria or fungi. Using this procedure, starting plant gums featuring a protein content having a degree of hydrolysis of approximately zero can be used.<br>
The duration of hydrolysis may vary between about a few seconds and about 300 minutes and is preferably from about 1 to about 30 minutes, more preferably from about 5 to about 10 minutes. In the case of the use of glycosylases the exact duration of the enzymatic treatment may be determined in an empirical way with respect to the desired properties of the modified gum, such as emulsifying stability, emulsifying capacity, droplet size of the emulsion, depending strongly on parameters like enzyme activities, or composition of the<br><br>
substrate. Alternatively it may be determined by measuring the osmolality as described in example 9.<br>
The inactivation of the hydrolase is suitably achieved by heat denaturation, e.g. by heating of the incubation batch to about 80 to 85°C for 5 to 30 minutes, especially for 5 to 10 minutes.<br>
Step<br>
Step C) may be carried out by centrifugation or filtration, preferably by ultrafiltration.<br>
Step D)<br>
The conversion into a solid form, e.g. a dry powder, can be achieved by spray drying or freeze-drying.

A further aspect of the invention refers to a process for the manufacture of a modified plant gum comprising the following steps:<br><br>
a)	preparing an aqueous solution or suspension of a plant gum having a dry mass content of<br>
from 0.1 to 60 weight-%, based on the total amount of the aqueous solution or suspension,<br>
whereby the plant gum has a protein part;<br>
b)	hydrolysing the protein part of the plant gum until a degree of hydrolysis of the protein<br>
part of up to 30%, preferably from about 1 to about 30%, is obtained; and/or hydrolysing<br>
the polysaccharide part of the plant gum until a degree of hydrolysis of the polysaccharide<br>
part of up to 50%, preferably from about 0.05 to about 20%, is obtained;<br>
c)	optionally fractionating the hydrolysate;<br>
d)	converting the optionally fractionated hydrolysate into a solid form.<br>
The steps a) to d) are explained in more detail in the following. Reference is also made to the according parts of the description of the steps A) to D) above and the preferences mentioned there.<br>
Step a)<br>
Suitable plant gums (polysaccharide based hydrocolloids) for use in this step and preferred examples thereof are mentioned in the description of step A) above. The protein part of the plant gum is conventionally of about  10 weight-%, especially of about  6 weight-%, frem-aboet 0 to-about 6weight-%,-;more.prefer-ably-of about=S-4.weight-%J even more preferably of about 0.5 to about 4 weight-%, most preferably of about 2 to about 4 weight-%, based on the total weight of the plant gum.<br>
Step b)<br>
The hydrolysis of step b) (the hydrolysis of the protein part) can be achieved by adjusting the pH of the plant gum solution or suspension to a value of between about 2 and about It), preferably to a value of between about 2 and about 9, more preferably to a value of between about 4 and about 8. In a preferred embodiment of the invention additionally a protease is added to such an adjusted solution/suspension.<br><br>
m a more preierred embodiment of the invention not only the protein part of the plant gum, but also the sugar/polysaccharide part of the plant gum is hydrolysed, This can be achieved by adding after or before or simultaneously with the protease a glycosylase to the aqueous solution or suspension of the plant gum.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the invention only the sugar/polysaccharide part of the plant gum is hydrolysed. This can be achieved by adding a glycosylase to the aqueous solution or suspension of the plant gum.<br>
Suitable proteases and glycosylases for use in this step and preferred examples thereof are mentioned in the description of step A) above.<br>
The amount of the protease and/or glycosylase each is independently from each other preferably of from about 0.01 to about 10 weight-%, based on the dry weight of the.plant gum.<br>
Conventionally step b) is carried out at a temperature of from about 5 to about 120°C, preferably at a temperature of from about 5 to about 70°C, more preferably at a temperature of from about 20 to about 55°C.<br>
Preferably step b) is stopped when the protein part of the plant gum solution or suspension is hydrolysed to a degree of from about 1% to about 10% and/or the polysaccharide part of #».pknfcjgum<is thydrolysed:to.a degree of front.about tcjrabcut5 jfoeertam-embodi-w. ments the present invention step b is stopped when protein part plant gum hydrolysed to a between and optionally polysaccharide up preferably from about more></is>
The absolute degree of hydrolysis can be determined in a manner known to those skilled in the art, e.g. as described by Petersen, D., Nielsen, P.M., Dambmann C., Determination of the Degree of Hydrolysis (DH) based on OPA Reaction, ED-9512723, Novo Nordisk A/S, Dec. 1995; Petersen, D., Nielsen, P.M., Dambmann C., Journal of Food Science 2001, 66 (5). 642-646 ("Improved method for determining food protein degree of hydrolysis."); Frister, H., Meisel, H., Schlimme, E., OPA method modified by use of N,N-dimethyl-2-<br><br>
mercaptoethylammonium chloride as thiol component, Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 330 (1988) 631. As already mentioned above for a plant gum with a low content of protein such as gum acacia (gum Arabic) from Acacia Senegal or Acacia seyal low degrees of hydrolysis, i.e. degrees of hydrolysis up to 5%, preferably between 0.05% to 2%, more preferably between 0.05% and 1%, may be determined preferably by the modified OPA method as described in examples 7 and 8. The relative degree of hydrolysis (relative to the polysaccharide part) can be determined by osmolality (W. Dzwokak and S. Ziajka, Journal of food science, 1999, 64 (3) 393-395; see also example <br>
The reaction can be stopped by neutralising the solution or suspension if an inorganic or organic acid or base is used or by heating to denature the protease that may preferably be used to hydrolyse the protein part of the plant gum. The reaction of the glycosylase may be stopped in the same way.<br>

Preferred embodiments of this process of the invention<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment of the invention the plant gum is subjected not only "toenzyaiatic-toydrolysis by using proteases, but also to further.enzymaticjrsatment by using polysaccharide-cleaving enzymes, so called glycosylases. This procedure can be carried out with either the aqueous solution or suspension of the modified plant gum after incubating with the proteases or with the solid form of the modified plant gum. In a further aspect of the invention plant gums can be subjected to enzymatic treatment by using polysaccharide-cleaving enzymes in a first step and optionally subjecting the so-obtained modified plant gums to enzymatic hydrolysis by using proteases in a second step. The enzymatic treatment by using polysaccharide-cleaving enzymes is carried out by adjusting the solution or suspension of plant gums or modified plant gums as described above to a pH of between about 2 and about 9, preferably to a pH of between about 4 and about 8, e.g. by the addition of any 0.1 to 5 M, preferably 0.5 to 2 M, organic and/or inorganic acid or base such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively and preferably brought to a temperature of from about 20 to about 60 °C, especially from about 30 to about 40°C, par-<br><br>

The enzyme is added to provide a concentration of from about 0.01 to about 1.0 weight-%, preferably of from about 0.1 to about 1 weight-%, based on the dry weight of the plant gum. The enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out for 1 to 600 minutes until the desired emulsifying properties in the end product are reached. The enzyme is then inactivated, suitably by heating of the incubation batch.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the enzyme mixture of protease and glycosylase is added at once. The enzymatic hydrolysis may also be carried out step-wise. For instance, the enzyme mixture is added to the incubation batch in an amount of e.g. 1 % whereupon, e.g. after 5 to 10 minutes (at a temperature of 35°C) further enzyme mixture which may by the same or different from the first added enzyme mixture is added, e.g. in an amount of 2 % whereupon the plant gum is further hydrolysed at 35°C for about 10 minutes.<br>

The spray-dried powder was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature over night. A fine powder was obtained.<br>
DH = degree of hydrolysis; h = number of hydrolyzed peptide bonds; htot = total number of peptide bonds.<br>
htot [milli equivalents Serin-NEb per g; meqv Serin-NHj/g] refers to the amino acid composition of the protein and is calculated as sum of the amounts of the amino acids (mmol) of the individual amino acid composition per g protein (J. Adler-Nissen, Enzymic Hydrolysis of food proteins; Elsevier Allied Science Publishers, London 1986, p. 115-131).<br>
A calculation with the amino acid compositions given in R.C. Randall, G.O. Phillips, P.A. Williams, Food Hydrocolloids 1989, 3(1), p. 65-75, Table m, entries "this study" and "reference, 1$", results in.atht«tivp^um.|^ig,S.enega]tpf 8,.128,riieqv^gipf^i^v|ind 8.2.58 ......<br>
meqv/g protein, respectively. If the amino acid composition given in M. E. Osman et aL, Phytochemisiry 1995, 38(2), p. 409-417, is taken as basis for the calculation a htot of 8.292 meqv/g protein results. The average htot (of these three data) is 8.226 meqv/g protein for gum arabic Senegal. Therefore, the further calculation is based on this numerical value.<br>
It is also possible to determine the amino acid composition via analysis of the total hydro-lysate and calculate htot on basis of these experimentally determined data.<br>

To get more exact results the correction factors a and (5 were determined experimentally. For this the following values have to be known: htot, the absorption of native gum arable (the native plant gum with a low protein content) and the absorption of totally hydrolysed gum arabic (the totally hydrolysed plant gum with a low protein content).<br>
= meqv Serm-NEk/g protein, i.e. the number of free amino groups per g protein, is calculated according to D. Petersen, P.M. Nielsen, C. Dambmann, Determination of the Degree of Hydrolysis based on OPA reaction, ED-9512723, Novo Nordisk A/S, 1995; Petersen, D., Nielsen, P.M., Dambmann C., Journal of Food Science 2001, 66 (5). 642-646 ("Improved method for determining food protein degree of hydrolysis.") as follows:<br>

The determination of DH was based on a modified OPA reaction as disclosed by H. Fris-ter, H. Meisel, E. Schlimme, Anal. Chem. 1988, 330, 631-633.<br>
a) Preparation of the OPA solution<br>
Solution 1: 7.620 g of Borax were dissolved in 100 g of demineralised water. Solution 2: 0.160 g of ortho-phthaldialdehyd (OPA) were dissolved in 4 ml of ethanol. Solution 3: 0.400 g of N,N-dimethyl-2-mercaptoethylammonium chloride 
 <br>
All solutions 1 to 3 were put together in a 200 ml flask. 0.200 g of sodium dodecyl sulphate (= "SDS") were added and demineralised water was added to get a total, of 200 ml of the OPA solution. Under exclusion of light the OPA solution can be stored for one week.<br>
tO Preparation of the samples, the control sample and the standard solution of serine and measurement of their absorption<br>
Native gum arabic as well as totally hydrolysed gum arabic were tested. (Other plant gums with a low protein content may also be measured accordingly.) To 0.1 mg of powderous gum arabic (It is recommended that in case of plant gums with a low protein content the 10-fold amount is used in comparison to plant gums with a high protein content.) was added an aqueous 10 weight-% SDS solution and the mixtures were stirred for 10 minutes at 90°C. Afterwards the solution was filled up with demineralised water to give a total of 100 ml, it was then centrifugated for 10 minutes at 10750 g and filtered over a 0.45 ujn filter. To 400 ul of this resulting solution 3 ml of the OPA solution were added. The mixture was stirred and measured then in a spectral photometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer Instruments, Boston, USA) at 340 nm exactly two minutes after preparation of the mixture. The sample of the totally hydrolysed gum arabic was prepared and measured accordingly.<br>
The control sample was demineralised water. To 400 \d of demineralised water 3 ml of the OPA solution were added. The mixture was stirred and measured then in a spectral phd-tometer:r(Lambda 25, PerKrfElmef Mstruinen'ts;:'BostOTi, USA):at"340&gt;nnT1exactly two minutes after preparation of the mixture.<br>
0.100 g of L-serine were dissolved in 500 ml of demineralised water to give the standard solution of serine which is used for the purpose of calibration. Standard solutions of serine with concentrations ranging between 10 and 200 mg/1 were measured therefore. To each of 400 ul of the standard solution of serine of a certain concentration 3 ml of the OPA solution were added. The mixture was stirred and measured then in a spectral photometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer Instruments, Boston, USA) at 340 nm exactly two minutes after preparation of the mixture.<br><br>
c) Calculation of g and B<br>
With the measured values for Assumptive, Abscontroi, and Abs standard (each measured twice and the average value taken) and with further taken into account the coloration of the sample of the totally hydrolyzed gum Arabic Ser-NH2 could be calculated according to formula ITT given above.<br>
Under the assumptions that the number of hydrolysed peptide bonds in native gum arabic is zero ((3 = Ser-NIk) and that the degree of hydrolysis is 100% for totally hydrolyzed gum arabic (i.e. h = hlot), a and (3 can be calculated: For gum arabic Senegal a is 1.999 meqv/g protein and P is 0.588 meqv/g protein.<br>
The method as described above for gum arabic Senegal may be applied accordingly to other plant gums with a low protein content, especially with a protein content 
Example 8: Determination of the Degree of Hydrolysis (DH) of gum arabic<br>
With the now known correction factors a and (3 for gum arabic Senegal (a = 1.999 meqv/g protein; P = 0.588 meqv/g protein) it is now possible via measuring the absorption at 340 nm (to determine Ser-NBb via formula HI) to calculate the number of hydrolysed peptide "H and tfius afso-th-eeffvrd formultiT(s'ee above).<br>

 <br>
Example 9: Determination of the degree of hydrolysis of the polvsaccharide part of gum Acacia<br>
To an aqueous suspension of the plant gum from Acacia Senegal having a dry matter content of 10 weight-%, based on the total amount of the aqueous suspension, is added 1 weight-% - based on the amount of the plant gum - of an enzyme produced from Aspergil-lus aculeateus e.g. commercially available as Peelzym® of Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark. The solution is then heated up at 50°C during 10 min without agitation and an aliquot of 0.15 mL is used to determine the relative degree of hydrolysis of sugar part by Os-molality (micro Osmometer, KNAUER). The read value is converted into relative degree of hydrolysis using the next formula, and taking as presumption that the osmotic coefficient for peptides (w) and the total number of peptides bonds (h tot) are constant during this hydrolysis:<br>
