Axial gap type rotating electric machine<br>
Technical Field<br>
an axial gap type<br>
The present invention relates to if rotating electric<br>
machine having a rotor and a stator constituting an electric<br>
motor, a generator or the like and utilizing both operation<br>
of a motor and a generator as a regenerative brake when the<br>
rotating electric machine is used as a drive source of a vehicle.<br>
Background Art<br>
A radial gap type electric motor is used as a general<br>
electric motor of a drive source or the like of an electric<br>
two-wheeled vehicle or the like. The radial gap type electric<br>
motor is provided with a magnet around an axis in a cylindrical<br>
shape on a side of, for example, a rotor, and provided with<br>
a plurality of teeth opposed to a cylindrical face of the magnet<br>
on a side of a stator and wound with coils around the teeth.<br>
Therefore, a gap between opposed faces of the magnet and the<br>
respective teeth is formed in a cylindrical shape along the<br>
axis.<br>
Meanwhile, an axial gap type electric motor is used as<br>
a rotation drive source of an audio apparatus or the like having<br>
a comparatively small output. The axial gap type electric motor<br><br>
is constituted by a yoke on a side of a rotor in a circular<br>
plate shape fixed to a rotating shaft, a yoke on a side of a<br>
stator in a circular plate shape opposed to the yoke on the<br>
side of the rotor, a magnet fixed to a side of an opposed face<br>
of the yoke of either one yoke on the side of the rotor or the<br>
side of the stator, a plurality of teeth arranged on the side<br>
of an opposed face of other yoke on the side of the rotor or<br>
the side of the stator radially and opposedly to the magnet<br>
and coils wound around respective teeth- Therefore, a gap<br>
between the opposed faces of the magnet and the teeth is formed<br>
in a planar shape orthogonal to an axis.<br>
Fig. 22 is an explanatory view of a magnetic flux of an<br>
axial gap type electric motor of a background art. The drawing<br>
shows a magnetic flux only with respect to one tooth 3 and<br>
illustration thereof is omitted with respect to left and right<br>
contiguous teeth 3.<br>
The stator 1 is provided with a stator yoke 2 in a circular<br>
plate shape having a laminated member of steel plates and a<br>
plurality of teeth 3 each similarly having a laminated member<br>
of steel plates which are arranged radially above the stator<br>
yoke 2 . Each tooth 3 is wound with a coil (not illustrated) .<br>
A rotor (not illustrated) in a circular plate shape is arranged<br>
opposedly to the teeth 3 of the stator. A magnet is fixed to<br>
the rotor at a predetermined gap from upper faces of the teeth<br>
3. Incidentally, the circular plate shape includes a circular<br><br>
shape and a planar ring shape (doughnut shape).<br>
A magnetic circuit is formed between the rotor/ not<br>
illustrated, and the stator, and a magnetic flux coming out<br>
from an N pole of the magnet is made to flow to the tooth 3<br>
and to the stator yoke 2 (arrow A) and flow to an S pole (not<br>
illustrated) of the magnet by passing other teeth 3. By<br>
energizing the coil, the tooth of that coil is excited to attract<br>
and repulse the magnet of the rotor opposed to an upper face<br>
of the tooth. By successively switching energization of the<br>
coil, the excited teeth are successively moved and the rotor<br>
is rotated along with the magnet.<br>
According to such an axial gap type motor, opposed faces<br>
of the magnet and the teeth are orthogonal to an axial direction<br>
and therefore, a length in the axial direction becomes shorter<br>
than that of the radial gap type. Also in the case of increasing<br>
an output, the opposed faces opposed to each other via the gap<br>
can be increased without prolonging the length in the axial<br>
direction and therefore, the constitution can contribute to<br>
thin formation of the motor.<br>
However, according to the above-described axial gap type<br>
electricmotor, by energizing the coil, themagnetic flux flowing<br>
from the tooth 3 to the stator yoke 2 is changed in a direction<br>
and a magnitude thereof since the magnet on the side of the<br>
rotor is rotated and by electromagnetic induction in accordance<br>
with an amount of the change, an induced current B in an eddy<br><br>
shape is made to flow at inside of the stator yoke 2 centering<br>
on the tooth 3 at a surrounding thereof (Fig. 22) . The induced<br>
current B becomes Joule's heat to constitute loss of energy<br>
and the motor efficiency is reduced.<br>
Although the loss of energy by the heat does not cause<br>
a serious problem in the case of a low output, when a strong<br>
magnet is used for achieving a large torque as in, for example,<br>
an electric two-wheeled vehicle, the loss is significantly<br>
increased and also a temperature rise rate is increased to bring<br>
about high temperatures.<br>
Therefore, although such an axial gap type electric motor<br>
is of a thin type and regarded to be preferable to mount to<br>
an axle or the like of an electric two-wheeled vehicle, the<br>
motor efficiency is significantly reduced in the case of the<br>
electric two-wheeled vehicle having a high torque and using<br>
a strong magnet and therefore, the axial gap type electric motor<br>
is not applied as the drive source.<br>
The invention takes a consideration of the<br>
above-described background art and it is an object thereof to<br>
provide an axial gap type rotating electric machine which is<br>
small-si zed and achieves a highmotor efficiency as, for example,<br>
a drive source having a high torque using a strong magnet by<br>
reducing energy loss by an induced current.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the<br>
invention provides an axial gap type rotating electric machine,<br>
including: a yoke on a side of a rotor in a circular plate shape<br>
fixed to a rotating shaft; a yoke on a side of a stator in a<br>
circular plate shape opposed to the yoke on the side of the<br>
rotor; a magnet fixed to a side of an opposed face of either<br>
one of the yokes on the side of the rotor or the side of the<br>
stator; a plurality of teeth arranged on a side of an opposed<br>
face of other yoke on the side of the rotor or the side of the<br>
stator radially and opposedly to the magnet and fixed to the<br>
yoke; and a coil wound around each of the plurality of teeth;<br>
wherein the teeth comprises a laminated member of plate members<br>
for the teeth and faces to be superposed of the plate members<br>
for the teeth are arranged in a circumferential direction.<br>
According to the constitution, an induced current by a<br>
magnetic flux flowing from the magnet to the teeth can<br>
effectively be reduced. This is based on the following reasons.<br>
The magnet is constituted by a circular plate (doughnut<br>
shape) and therefore, in a circumferential direction of the<br>
teeth, the magnet is present also at a portion which is not<br>
opposed to the teeth. The magnetic flux coming out from that<br>
magnet is brought not in an opposed face (upper face) of the<br>
toothbut a side face (lateral face) ona side in a radial direction<br>
(C of Figs. 17, 18). When the side face is disposed on a side<br>
of faces to be superposed of plate members of the teeth, an<br><br>
eddy current is formed at in-face and therefore, a large induced<br>
current is made to flow.<br>
Meanwhile, even when the magnet is extruded in a radial<br>
direction from a face thereof opposed to the teeth, an amount<br>
thereof is small and therefore, also an amount of the magnetic<br>
flux coming out from the magnet (D of Figs. 17, 18) is small.<br>
Therefore, even when the face is the face to be superposed of<br>
the plate members for the teeth, the loss is small. That is,<br>
the magnet opposed to the teeth is provided with an actual<br>
rectangular face opposed to the teeth and extruded portions<br>
of outer peripheral edges of four sides. The extruded portions<br>
of four sides are four sides of two inner and outer sides in<br>
the radial direction and two left and right sides in the<br>
circumferential direction. Among them, the extruded portions<br>
in the circumferential direction are larger than the extruded<br>
portions in the radial direction and therefore, by arranging<br>
a side face (face showing a plate thickness) of each plate member<br>
for the teeth opposedly to the magnetic flux from the<br>
circumferential direction, the eddy current is difficult to<br>
be formed and the induced current can be reduced.<br>
In other words, since the extruded portions in the radial<br>
direction are smaller than the extruded portions in the<br>
circumferential direction, the induced current can be reduced<br>
by providing the magnetic flux of the portions to the side of<br>
the faces to be superposed of the plate members for the teeth.<br><br>
Incidentally, almost all of the magnetic flux coming out<br>
from the magnet is brought into the teeth by passing the upper<br>
faces of the teeth, and the magnetic flux from the extruded<br>
portion is small.<br>
A preferable constitution example is characterized in<br>
that a fixing hole for fixing the teeth provided at the yoke<br>
is formed into a shape having a longitudinal direction and the<br>
longitudinal direction is directed in the radial direction.<br>
According to the constitution, a face of each plate member<br>
for the teeth from which a side face thereof is seen (a face<br>
in which an eddy current is difficult to flow) is arranged in<br>
the longitudinal direction, the face is arrangedon a side having<br>
the large magnetic flux and therefore, the induced current can<br>
efficiently be reduced.<br>
A preferable constitution example is characterized.in<br>
that the fixing hole is a rectangular shape.<br>
According to the constitution, the teeth can be formed<br>
by laminating the plate members for the teeth having a constant<br>
shape.<br>
A preferable constitution example is characterized in<br>
that a magnetic resistance portion is provided between a side<br>
of the face to be superposed of the tooth and the fixing hole<br>
of the stator yoke<br>
According to the constitution, by increasing magnetic<br>
resistance by forming, for example, a space between the side<br><br>
of the faces to be superposed of the plate members for the teeth<br>
at which the eddy current is liable to be formed and the fixing<br>
hole, the magnetic flux passing the faces is reduced and the<br>
induced current is reduced.<br>
A preferable constitution example is characterized in<br>
that a resistance portion against the induced current is provided<br>
between the side face showing a plate thickness of each plate<br>
member for the teeth and the fixing hole of the stator yoke.<br>
According to the constitution, the induced current can<br>
effectively be reduced. That is, normally, a press fit face<br>
of the laminated teeth which is press-fit to the fixing hole<br>
is brought into close contact and the current is liable to flow<br>
and therefore, the eddy current is made to flow between the<br>
laminated plate members for the teeth. According to the<br>
invention, an electric resistance is increased and the induced<br>
current is reduced by providing a space or an insulating member<br>
or the like at the press fit close contact face.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A description will be given of embodiments of the invention<br>
with reference to the drawings as follows.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of an electric two-wheeled vehicle<br>
to which an axial gap type electric motor of the invention is<br>
applied.<br>
The electric two-wheeled vehicle 10 is mounted with a<br>
steering shaft (not illustrated) of a handle 6 which is inserted<br>
to a head pipe 5 fixedly attached to a front end of a main frame<br>
4 and supports a front wheel 8 via a front fork 7 connected<br>
thereto. A saddle 9 is provided at a central portion of a vehicle<br><br>
body and a battery 11 is fixed to the main frame 4 on a lower<br>
side of the saddle. A swing arm 13 is pivotably supported by<br>
way of a pivot 12 via a damper 14 from a central portion to<br>
a rear side of the main frame 4. A motor case 16 is integrally<br>
formed at a rear end portion on the swing arm 13. An axial<br>
gap type electric motor according to the invention, mentioned<br>
later, is mounted to inside of the motor case 16 along with<br>
an axle (not illustrated) of a rear wheel 15 and coaxially with<br>
the axle.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram of an essential portion of a rear<br>
wheel portion of the electric two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
A tire 15a of the rear wheel 15 is mounted with a wheel<br>
18 fixed to an axle 17. An electric motor 19 of an axial gap<br>
type is mounted to inside of the motor case 16 integral with<br>
the swing arm 13. The electric motor 19 is constituted by a<br>
rotor shaft 20, a rotor yoke 21 fixed to the rotor shaft 20,<br>
a magnet 22 fixed to the rotor yoke 21, a stator yoke 23 fixed<br>
to the motor case 16, a plurality of teeth 24 fixed to the stator<br>
yoke 23 by being aligned radially and opposedly to the magnet<br>
22, and a coil 25 wound around each of the teeth 24.<br>
One end portion of the rotor 20 is rotatably supported<br>
by the motor case 16 via a bearing 26 and other end thereof<br>
is rotatably supported by the axle 17 via a shaft support 27.<br>
The rotor shaft 20 is connected to the axle 17 via a planetary<br>
mechanism 28. The planetary mechanism 28 per se is publicly<br><br>
known and constituted by a cylindrical housing 29, a ring gear<br>
30 provided at an inner face of the housing 29, a sun gear 31<br>
provided at the rotor shaft 20, a planetary gear 32 rotated<br>
and revolved by being brought in mesh with the sun gear 31 and<br>
the ring gear 30, a carrier 33 supporting the planetary gear<br>
32 and a carrier support plate 34 supporting the carrier 33<br>
and integral with the axle 17. The axle 17 is rotatably attached<br>
to the housing 29 via a bearing 35.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram of an essential portion of a stator<br>
portion of an axial gap type electric motor according to the<br>
invention.<br>
A plurality of the teeth 24 each having a laminated member<br>
of steel plates are radially arranged above the stator yoke<br>
23 in a circular plate shape (doughnut shape) having a laminated<br>
member of steel plates and is, for example, fixedly press-fit<br>
thereto. As shown in Fig. 11, mentioned later, the stator yoke<br>
23 is formed by laminating plate members 123 for the yoke<br>
constituted by punching steel plates (in a doughnut shape as<br>
shown in Fig. 3 in this example). Further, as shown in Fig.<br>
11, the teeth 24 are formed by laminating plate members 124<br>
for the teeth constituted by punching steel plates.<br>
The plate members 124 for the teeth are laminated by<br>
superposing front and rear plate faces 124a. A side face 124b<br>
in correspondence with a plate thickness of a steel plate is<br>
exposed to a side face of the tooth 24 which is the laminated<br><br>
member. According to the example, a laminating direction is<br>
a radius direction (radial direction) and the tooth 24 is fixedly<br>
press-fit to the yoke 23 such that a direction of the plate<br>
face 124a constituting the face to be superposed becomes a<br>
circumferential direction.<br>
The coil 25 (Fig. 2) is wound around each tooth 24. As<br>
shown in Fig. 2, mentioned above, the magnet 22 fixed to the<br>
rotor yoke 21 in the circular plate shape is arranged opposedly<br>
to the teeth 24 with a predetermined gap therebetween.<br>
According to the embodiment, a slit 36 is formed by cutting<br>
the stator yoke 23 on an outer peripheral side of each tooth<br>
24.<br>
Fig. 4 is an explanatory view of operation of the slit<br>
provided at the stator yoke.<br>
By energizing the coil (not illustrated) wound around<br>
each tooth 24, the tooth 24 of the coil is excited to attract<br>
and repulse the magnet of the rotor (not illustrated) opposed<br>
to an upper face of the tooth. By successively switching the<br>
excited coil, the rotor is made to rotate by successively<br>
attracting and repulsing the magnet. At this occasion, a<br>
magnetic flux is made to flow from a side of the magnet to the<br>
teeth 24 and a magnetic path is formed by passing the magnet,<br>
the predetermined tooth 24 and the stator yoke 23. The magnetic<br>
flux forming the magnetic path is made to flow from the<br>
predetermined tooth 24 by passing the stator yoke 23 as shown<br><br>
by an arrowA. As explained with reference to Fig. 17, an induced<br>
current is generated at inside of the stator yoke 23 at a<br>
surrounding of the tooth 24 (at a position of a dotted line<br>
in the drawing). However, according to the embodiment, the<br>
slit 36 for constituting an insulating layer is formed at the<br>
stator yoke 23 on an outer peripheral side of a press fit portion<br>
of a root portion of each tooth 24 and therefore, an induced<br>
current is blocked and substantially, the induced current does<br>
not flow.<br>
That is, the slit 36 constitutes a resistance portion<br><br>
against the induced current and the induced current is blocked<br>
or reduced. The resistance portion is not limited to a slit<br>
having a slender interval but may be formed by a space portion<br>
of a cut having almost no interval or a hole having other shape<br>
or the like. Further, an insulating film may be interposed<br>
or an insulating agent of a resin or the like may be filled<br>
therein. Or, the induced current may be reduced by providing<br>
an insulating property by denaturing a portion at which the<br>
induced current flows by a treatment of a chemical treatment,<br>
a laser treatment or the like.<br>
Fig. 5 is a plane view of the stator yoke according to<br>
the embodiment of the invention.<br>
The stator yoke 23 in the ring-like shape is formed to<br>
be penetrated by a plurality of teeth press fit holes 37. The<br>
slit 36 opened to an outer peripheral side of each press fit<br><br>
hole 37 is formed by cutting the stator yoke 23.<br>
The press fit hole 37 is a fixing portion for inserting<br>
a portion of the tooth (press fit portion 24a in Fig. 11) to<br>
fix to the yoke. The fixing portion may be a hole penetrating<br>
the yoke 23 in a plate thickness direction as shown in Fig.<br>
9 (A), mentioned later, or may be recess which does not penetrate<br>
therethrough but formed with a hole to a middle thereof as shown<br>
in Fig. 9(C).<br>
Fig. 6 is a plane view of a stator yoke according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The embodiment is formed with a slit 36 by cutting an<br>
inner peripheral side of each teeth press fit hole 37 formed<br>
at a stator yoke 23. Even when the inner peripheral side of<br>
each teeth press fit hole 37 is cut in this way, similar to<br>
the example of Fig. 5, the induced current can be blocked.<br>
Fig. 7 is a plane view of a stator yoke according to still<br>
another embodiment of the invention.<br>
The embodiment is formed with a slit 36 in a circular<br>
arc shape or a linear shape by communicating central portions<br>
in a radial direction of teeth press fit holes 37 contiguous<br>
to each other. In this way, the slit 36 is formed along a<br>
circumferential direction (a direction orthogonal to the radial<br>
direction) of a stator yoke 23. By the slit 36, an induced<br>
current formed at a surrounding of the press fit hole fixed<br>
with the tooth can be blocked or reduced.<br><br>
In this case, the induced current can effectively be<br>
restrained from being generated by forming the slit 36 by<br>
connecting a set of the teeth 24 constituting 360° in an<br>
electrical angle. The example of Fig. 7 is an example of forming<br>
an electrical angle of 360° by three pieces of contiguous teeth<br>
24 (U phase, V phase, W phase) in a motor having 18 slots and<br>
12 poles and the slit 36 is formed by connecting the central<br>
portions in the radial direction of the respective teeth press<br>
fit holes 37 at every three pieces of the teeth press fit holes<br>
37 contiguous to each other. Further, a position of the slit<br>
36 may also be other than the central portion.<br>
Fig. 8 is an explanatory view of a shape of still another<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The embodiment is formed with a connecting portion 136<br>
at an end portion of a slit such that a peripheral edge of teeth<br>
press fit hole 37 is brought into a continuous state without<br>
opening the slit 36 to the teeth press fit hole 37 but cutting<br>
the slit 36 before the teeth press fit hole. Thereby, not only<br>
the induced current is reduced but also deformation of the stator<br>
yoke and reduction in a force to hold the press-fitting teeth<br>
by forming the slit 36 can be prevented. Further, although<br>
the example of drawing shows an example of applying to the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 5 formed with the slit 36 on an outer peripheral<br>
side of the tooth, also with regard to the examples of Fig.<br>
6 and Fig. 7, similarly, the slit 36 maybe formed without opening<br><br>
the slit 36 to the teeth press fit hole 37 but in a state of<br>
making the peripheral edge of the teeth press fit hole 37<br>
continuous.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates sectional views of a portion of the<br>
yoke 23 taken along a line X-X of Fig. 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 (A), the stator yoke 23 is the laminated<br>
member of the plate members 123 for the yoke and the connecting<br>
portion 136 is formed between the press fit hole 37 and the<br>
slit 36.<br>
Fig. 9(B) is a modified example of Fig. 9(A) and is an<br>
example in which the slit 36 is not penetrated in the plate<br>
thickness direction of the yoke 23 but is formed to a middle<br>
thereof. According to the example, the lowermost plate member<br>
123 of the yoke is not formed with an opening for the slit.<br>
In this way, by providing a portion in which the slit is not<br>
formed also in the plate thickness direction of the yoke along<br>
with the connecting portion 136, an effect of preventing<br>
deformation of the yoke is increased.<br>
Fig. 9(C) shows the press fit hole 37 in a shape of a<br>
recess in which the press fit hole 37 is not penetrated in the<br>
plate thickness direction of the yoke 23 but is formed to a<br>
middle thereof. According to the example, the lowermost plate<br>
member 113 of the yoke is not formed with the press fit hole<br>
37.<br>
Fig. 10(A) through 10(G) are views showing still another<br><br>
examples of shapes of resistance portions against the induced<br>
current according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 10(A) is formed with the slits 36 alternately on<br>
the inner peripheral side and the outer peripheral side of the<br>
press fit holes 37. The slits 36may not alternately be provided<br>
at every inner peripheral side and outer peripheral side of<br>
the press fit holes 37 but at every plural pieces thereof.<br>
Fig. 10(B) is formed with two of the slits 36 from a reverse<br>
direction on the outer peripheral side (or inner peripheral<br>
side). By aligning two (or more) of the slits in a labyrinth<br>
shape in a state in which end portions of the slits on one side<br>
are not opened but closed to be continuous in this way, similar<br>
to the example of Fig. 8, not only the strength of the yoke<br>
ismaintainedbut also the resistanceagainst the induced current<br>
is increased and the effect of reducing the induced current<br>
is increased.<br>
In Fig. 10(C), both end portions of the slits 36 in the<br>
radial direction are not opened but closed to connect. That<br>
is, in the example of Fig. 8, also with regard to the outer<br>
peripheral edge side of the yoke 23, the end portions of the<br>
slits 3 6 are made to be continuous similar to those on the inner<br>
peripheral side.<br>
In Fig. 10(D), the slit 36 in the radial direction is<br>
inclined in a skewed direction. The slit 36 may be bent.<br>
In Fig. 10 (E), between the press fit holes 37 contiguous<br><br>
to each other, the plurality (three in this example) of the<br>
slits 36 are provided in the circumferential direction in a<br>
labyrinth shape similar to Fig. 10(B).<br>
In Fig. 10(F), between the press fit holes 37 contiguous<br>
to each other, the slit 3 6 which is made to be continuous by<br>
closing both ends thereof similar to Fig. 10(C) are provided<br>
in the circumferential direction.<br>
In Fig. 10(G), a resistance portion against the induced<br>
current is constituted by forming holes 36', in a circular shape<br>
in place of the slits 36 on the inner peripheral side and the<br>
outer peripheral side of the press fit hole 37. The shape,<br>
a position and a number of the resistance portions (holes 36' )<br>
are not limited to those of the example of the drawing.<br>
Fig. 11 is an exploded view of the stator according to<br>
the invention.<br>
According to the example, the stator according to the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 5 is shown. The stator yoke 23 formed with<br>
the slit 36 on the outer peripheral side of the teeth press<br>
fit hole 37 is the laminated member of the plate members 123<br>
for the yoke formed of steel plates. The tooth 24 which is<br>
the laminated member of the plate members 124 for the teeth<br>
formed of steel plates is inserted into the stator yoke 23 by<br>
passing a bobbin (insulator) 38 made of an insulating member<br>
and a bobbin flange 39 which are mounted at a position of each<br>
teeth press fit hole 37 of the stator yoke 23. The tooth 24<br><br>
is fixedly held by press-fitting the press fit portion 24a at<br>
a lower end thereof into the teeth press fit hole 37. The coil<br>
25 is wound around the tooth 24 via the bobbin 38.<br>
Fig. 12 is a whole perspective viewof thestator according<br>
to the invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, mentioned above, the teeth 24 wound<br>
with the coils 25 via the bobbins 38 are aligned radially above<br>
the ring-like stator yoke 23 and press-fitted to be fixedly<br>
held. Thereby, the stator 1 is formed. According to the example,<br>
the slit36is formed at the stator yoke 2 3 on the outer peripheral<br>
side of each tooth 24.<br>
Fig. 13 is a whole sectional view of an electric motor<br>
integrated with the stator of Fig. 12.<br>
Amotor case 40 surrounding the entiremotor is constituted<br>
by a front cover 41 and a rear cover 42 in a circular plate<br>
shape and a side cover 43 in a cylindrical shape. The front<br>
cover 41 is fixed with the stator yoke 23 formed with the<br>
above-described slit 36 of the invention. An end portion of<br>
the rotor shaft 20 is rotatably mounted to the front cover 41<br>
via the bearing 26. The vicinity of the outer end portion of<br>
the rotor shaft 20 is rotatably supported by the rear cover<br>
42 via a bearing 44. The rotor yoke 21 is fixed to the rotor<br>
shaft 20. The rotor yoke 21 is fixed with the magnet 22. The<br>
teeth 24 press-fit to the stator yoke 23 is arranged to be opposed<br>
to the magnet 22 via a predetermined gap G therebetween.<br><br><br>
Fig. 14 shows the stator sealed by a resin mold. Fig.<br>
14(A) is a plane view and Fig. 14(B) is a sectional view.<br>
The yoke 23 is mounted with the plurality of teeth 24<br>
in a ring-like shape and each tooth 24 is wound with the coil<br>
25 via the bobbin 38. Substantially the whole stator 1 having<br>
the yoke 23 and the teeth 24 in this way is molded and sealed<br>
by a resin member 131. A lower face side and a base plate<br>
attaching portion 132 of the resin mold member are formed with<br>
positioning bosses 130, 134. Numeral 135 designates a screw<br>
hole for attaching the base plate. A peripheral edge portion<br>
of the resin mold member is formed with an attaching hole 136<br>
and mounted with a collar 137.<br>
By sealing the stator 1 by the resin mold in this way,<br>
the teeth 24 mounted with the coil or the like is firmly held<br>
fixedly by the yoke 23. Further, when the above-described<br>
various slits 36 or the like are formed in order to reduce the<br>
induced current, the yoke is liable to be deformed in<br>
press-fitting the teeth, however, even when the yoke is deformed,<br>
when the yoke is subjected to molding, the yoke can be set in<br>
a state of being corrected by a die and the stator can be molded<br>
in an undeformed shape having high dimensional accuracy.<br>
When the deformation is corrected in this way, a mark<br>
138 of a hold pin provided at the die for correcting the yoke<br>
is formed at the mold member of the resin mold 131. In this<br>
example, the mark 138 of the hold pin is formed on the yoke<br><br>
between the respective teeth 23, the portion is not provided<br>
with the resin and a surface of the yoke is exposed. The marks<br>
138 of the hold pins are also formed on a rear face side of<br>
the stator 1.<br>
Fig. 15 is a perspective view of teeth according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
According to the embodiment, a laminating direction of<br>
the tooth 24 is changed. That is, according to the example<br>
of Fig. 15, the plate face 124a (refer to both front and rear<br>
faces with respect to each sheet of the plate member 124)<br>
constituting the face to be superposed of the respective plate<br>
members 124 for the teeth constituting the teeth 24 of the<br>
laminated member is directed in the radial direction of the<br>
stator yoke 23. The side face 124b (the face showing the plate<br>
thickness of the steel plate) of the plate member 124 for the<br>
teeth is arranged in the circumferential direction of the stator<br>
yoke 23.<br>
Even when the plate face 124a constituting the face to<br>
be superposed of the respective plate members 124 for the teeth<br>
is directed in the radial direction in this way, similar to<br>
the above-described example (Fig. 11) directing the plate face<br>
124a in the circumferential direction, the effect of reducing<br>
the induced current by the slit 36 is sufficiently achieved.<br>
Fig. 1.6 is a perspective view of still another embodiment<br>
of the invention.<br><br>
According to the embodiment, gaps 45 are provided at press<br>
fit portions on an inner peripheral side and an outer peripheral<br>
side (only the inner peripheral side is illustrated) of the<br>
tooth 24 press-fitted to the stator yoke 23. Further, according<br>
to the example, with regard to a section in a rectangular shape<br>
of the press fit portion of the tooth 24, a long side thereof<br>
is directed in the radial direction and a short side thereof<br>
is directed in the circumferential direction. In this case,<br>
the plate face 124a constituting the face to be superposed of<br>
the plate member 124 for the teeth is arranged on the side of<br>
the short side and the side face 124b (face showing the plate<br>
thickness) of the plate member 124 for the teeth is arranged<br>
on the side of the long side. Therefore, the gap 45 is formed<br>
on the side of the plate face 124a constituting the face to<br>
be superposed of the teeth 24 and on the side of the short side<br>
of the rectangular shape. The gap 45 is formed by notching<br>
the teeth press fit hole 37 provided at the yoke 23.<br>
By the gap 45, the magnetic flux passing the plate face<br>
124a on the side of the short side arranged in the circumferential<br>
direction is reduced, the induced current based on the magnetic<br>
flux is reduced and the energy loss is further alleviated.<br>
Further, by arranging the side face 124b of each plate members<br>
124 on the side of the long side, the large induced current<br>
generated on the side of the long side can effectively be reduced<br>
by a resistance of the boundary faces of the laminated layers.<br><br>
Fig. 17 is an explanatory view of a flow of the magnetic<br>
flux when the plate face 124a of each plate member 124 for the<br>
teeth of the tooth 24 shown in Fig. 15, mentioned above, is<br>
directed in the radial direction, theplate members are laminated<br>
in the circumferential direction and the side of the long side<br>
of the press fit portion is made to constitute the plate face<br>
124a.<br>
The magnet, not illustrated, is arranged opposedly to<br>
the upper face side of the tooth 24. The magnetic flux'(not<br>
illustrated) is made to flow from the magnet to the upper face<br>
of the tooth, and a magnetic flux C and the magnetic flux D<br>
are made to flow from side faces of an upper portion of the<br>
tooth other than the magnetic flux flowing from the upper face.<br>
At this occasion, the magnetic flux C flowing from the side<br>
of the plate face 124a constituting the face to be superposed<br>
of the tooth 24 is larger than the magnetic flux D flowing from<br>
the side of the side face 124b of the plate member 124 for the<br>
teeth constituting the face showing the plate thickness. An<br>
eddy current is made to flow at in-face at the plate face 124a<br>
and therefore, a comparatively large induced current E is<br>
generated based on the magnetic flux C at in-face of each plate<br>
member 124.<br>
Further, with regard to a magnetic flux coming out from<br>
the tooth 24 to the side of the stator yoke 23, a large magnetic<br>
flux F is made to flow from the side of the long side of the<br><br>
press fit portion having a section in the rectangular shape<br>
and a small magnetic flux G is made to flow from the side of<br>
the short side. Also in the magnetic flux on the outlet side,<br>
a comparatively large induced current H is generated at in-face<br>
of each steel plate based on the large magnetic flux on the<br>
side of the long side.<br>
Therefore, according to the constitution in which the<br>
side of the long side of the press fit portion having the section<br>
in the rectangular shape is made to constitute the plate face<br>
124a by directing the plate face 124a constituting the face<br>
to be superposed of the teeth 24 in the radial direction, although<br>
the induced current B flowing to a total of the surrounding<br>
of the tooth 24 shown in Fig. 22, mentioned above, is effectively<br>
blocked by the slit 36, the induced currents E, H by the magnetic<br>
fluxes in the direction orthogonal to the lateral face of the<br>
tooth 24 are made to flow at in-face of each plate member 124<br>
for the teeth and energy loss thereby is generated.<br>
Fig. 18 is an explanatory view of a flow of a magnetic<br>
flux when the plate face 124a constituting the face to be<br>
superposed of the plate member 124 for the teeth of the tooth<br>
24 shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 16, mentioned above, is directed<br>
in the circumferential direction and the side of the long side<br>
of the press fit portion orthogonal thereto is made to constitute<br>
the side face 124b showing the plate thickness of each plate<br>
member 124.<br><br>
Similar to the above-described example of Fig. 17, the<br>
magnet, not illustrated, is arranged opposedly to the side of<br>
the upper face of the tooth 24. The magnetic flux (not<br>
illustrated) is made to flow from the magnet to the upper face<br>
of the tooth and the magnetic flux C and the magnetic flux D<br>
are made to flow from the lateral faces of the upper portion<br>
of the tooth other than the magnetic flux flowing from the upper<br>
face. At this occasion, the magnetic flux C flowing from the<br>
lateral face on the side of the side face 124b of the plate<br>
member 124 of the tooth 24 is larger than the magnetic flux<br>
D flowing from the lateral face on the side of the plate face<br>
124a constituting the face to be superposed.<br>
In the case of the tooth 24 of Fig. 18, since the plate<br>
face 124a is directed in the circumferential direction, an<br>
induced current J is generated based on the magnetic flux D<br>
at in-face of each plate member 124, however, the induced current<br>
J is small since the magnetic flux D is small.<br>
Further, also with regard to the magnetic flux coming<br>
out from the tooth 24 to the side of the stator yoke 23, similar<br>
to the above-described example of Fig. 17, the large magnetic<br>
flux F is made to flow from the side of the long side of the<br>
press fit portion having the section in the rectangular shape<br>
and the small magnetic flux G is made to flow from the side<br>
of the short side. Also with regard to the magnetic flux on<br>
the outlet side, according to the example of Fig. 18, the plate<br><br>
face 124a of the tooth 24 is disposed on the side of the short<br>
side and therefore, an induced current K is generated at in-f ace<br>
of the steel plate based on the magnetic flux G on the side<br>
of the short side, however, the induced current K is small since<br>
the magnetic flux G is small.<br>
Therefore, as shown in Fig. 18, by directing the face<br>
on the side of the side face 124b showing the plate thickness<br>
of each plate member 124 for the teeth of the tooth 24 in the<br>
radial direction and providing the face on the side of the long<br>
side of the press fit portion having the section in the<br>
rectangular shape, the energy loss can be alleviated by reducing<br>
the induced current by the magnetic flux brought into the tooth<br>
via the lateral face of the tooth.<br>
Figs. 19(A) through 19(E) are explanatory views of shapes<br>
of teeth press fit holes according to still other embodiments<br>
of the invention.<br>
Fig. 19(A) shows the structure of the background art and<br>
the tooth 24 having the laminated member of the steel plates<br>
is press-fit to the press fit hole 37 of the stator yoke 23.<br>
According to the structure, the induced current B is generated<br>
as described above. The induced current Bis blocked by forming<br>
the slit 36 as shown in Fig. 19(B). However, when the face<br>
(refer to Fig. 11, Fig. 16) on the side of the side face 124a<br>
of the plate member 124 for the teeth of the tooth 24 is brought<br>
into press contact (contact with low resistance) with the inner<br><br>
face of the press fit hole 137 of the yoke 23, as shown in Fig.<br>
19 (C), an induced current Y detouring the slit 36 via the press<br>
contact face is made to flow. According to the embodiment,<br>
as shown in Fig. 19(D), respective side faces of the tooth 24<br>
are provided with insulating layers by gaps 4 6 (or insulating<br>
films) having a length of, for example, a half of the length<br>
of the long side by shifting positions thereof from each other.<br>
Thereby, the induced current Y via the respective plate members<br>
124 is blocked over a total length of the long side. The gaps<br>
46 may be formed along the total length of the long sides on<br>
the both sides of the press fit hole 37 (or the total length<br>
of the long side only on one side) as shown in Fig. 19(E).<br>
In the case of Fig. 19 (E), as shown in Fig. 20, the press<br>
fit portion 24a of the tooth 24 can firmly be held fixedly at<br>
inside of the press fit hole 37 by several sheets of the plate<br>
members 123 by not forming the gap 4 6 over the total of the<br>
yoke 23 in the thickness direction and by not forming the gap<br>
46 at the several lower sheets of the plate members 123 for<br>
the yoke. Also in the case of Fig. 19(D), a force of fixedly<br>
holding the tooth 24 may be increased by not forming the gap<br>
46 at the several lower sheets of the plate members 123 of the<br>
yoke in this way.<br>
The gap 4 6 is for blocking the induced current and therefore,<br>
the embodiment is not limited to the gap having the space but<br>
an electrically insulating member may be provided. That is,<br><br>
a resistance portion against the induced current may be<br>
constituted.<br>
Fig. 20 shows examples of forming the resistance portion<br>
(gap 46) provided at the press fit portion. In Fig. 20(A),<br>
the gaps 4 6 are provided on both sides of the press fit portion<br>
24a having a narrow width formed at the lower end portion of<br>
the tooth 24. In Fig. 20(B), a total of a lower portion of<br>
the tooth 24 is formed by a shape having the same width including<br>
the press fit portion 24a at the lower end and the gaps 4 6 are<br>
formed on the both sides of the press fit portion 24a on the<br>
side of the yoke 23. In Fig. 20(C), the press fit portion 24a<br>
is formed by widening the width of the lower end portion of<br>
the tooth 24, the press fit portion 37 on the side of the yoke<br>
23 stays to be the same through hole and the gaps 4 6 are formed<br>
on an upper side of the press fit portion 24a. Further, in<br>
any of the cases, the gap 4 6 may be formed only on one side<br>
of the tooth 24.<br>
Fig. 21 shows another embodiment of the invention.<br>
According to the embodiment, the shape of the teeth 24<br>
is formed not by the rectangular shape but by a trapezoidal<br>
shape different from the above-described embodiment. The<br>
trapezoidal shape is a slender trapezoidal shape having a long<br>
side on an outer peripheral side and a short side on an inner<br>
peripheral side and constituting a longitudinal direction<br>
thereof by a radial direction. By constituting the teeth 24<br><br>
by the trapezoidal shape in this way, in comparison with the<br>
case of the rectangular shape, an interval W on the outer<br>
peripheral side between the contiguous tees 24 can be reduced.<br>
Thereby, the induced current can be reduced by increasing the<br>
magnetic flux brought from the magnet (not illustrated) opposed<br>
to the upper face of the teeth to inside thereof via the upper<br>
face of the teeth and reducing the magnetic flux of an extruded<br>
portion brought from a lateral face thereof.<br>
The teeth 24 having such a trapezoidal shape is formed<br>
by changing a shape of the laminated plate member 124 for the<br>
teeth such that a width thereof is gradually reduced.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As has been described above, according to the invention,<br>
by arranging the face of the teeth formed of the laminated member<br>
of the plate members for the teeth for superposing the respective<br>
plate members for the teeth in the circumferential direction,<br>
the induced current by the magnetic flux flowing from the magnet<br>
to the teeth can effectively be reduced.<br>
In this case, the fixing hole for fixing the teeth provided<br>
at the yoke is formed by the shape having the longitudinal<br>
direction, and according to the constitution in which the<br>
longitudinal direction is directed in the radial direction,<br>
the face (face in which eddy current is difficult to flow) from<br>
which the side faces of the respective plate members for the<br><br>
teeth are seen is arranged in the longitudinal direction, the<br>
face is arranged on the side having the large magnetic flux<br>
and therefore, the induced current can efficiently be reduced.<br>
Further, according to the constitution of forming the<br>
fixing hole into the rectangular shape, the teeth can be formed<br>
by laminating the plate members for the teeth having the constant<br>
shape.<br>
Further, according to the constitution provided with the<br>
magnetic resistance portion between the side of the face to<br>
be superposed of the tooth and the fixing hole of the stator<br>
yoke, by increasing the magnetic resistance by forming, for<br>
example, a space between the side of the face to be superposed<br>
of the plate member for the teeth at which the eddy current<br>
is liable to be formed and the fixing hole, the magnetic flux<br>
passing the face is reduced and the induced current is reduced.<br>
Further, according to the constitution provided with the<br>
resistance portion against the induced current between the side<br>
face showing the plate thickness of each plate member for the<br>
teeth and the fixing hole of the stator yoke, the induced current<br>
can effectively be reduced. That is, although normally, the<br>
press fit face of the laminated layers of the teeth press-fit<br>
to the fixing hole is brought into close contact therewith and<br>
the current is liable to flow and therefore, the eddy current<br>
flows between the laminated plate members for the teeth, the<br>
induced current can be reduced by increasing the electric<br><br>
resistance by providing the space or the insulating member or<br>
the like at the press fit close contact face.<br><br>

a yoke on a side of a rotor in a circular plate shape fixed to a<br>
rotating shaft;<br>
a yoke on a side of a stator in a circular plate shape opposed to<br>
the yoke on the side of the rotor;<br>
a magnet fixed to a side of an opposed face of either one of the<br>
yokes on the side of the rotor or the side of the stator;<br>
a plurality of teeth arranged on a side of an opposed face of<br>
other yoke on the side of the rotor or the side of the stator<br>
radially and opposedly to the magnet and fixed to the yoke; and<br>
a coil wound around each of the plurality of teeth;<br>
wherein the teeth comprises a laminated member of plate<br>
members for the teeth and faces to be superposed of the plate<br>
members for the teeth are arranged in a circumferential<br>
direction, and<br>
a resistance portion against an induced current is provided<br>
between a side face showing a plate thickness of each plate<br>
member for the teeth and the fixing hole of the stator yoke.<br><br>
There is provided an axial gap type rotating electric<br>
machine which is small-sized and achieves a high motor efficiency<br>
as a drive source having a high torque using, for example, a<br>
strong magnet by reducing an energy loss by an induced current.<br>
