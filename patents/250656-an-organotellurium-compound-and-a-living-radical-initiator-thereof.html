TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to organotellurium compounds and a process for preparing the same. More particularly, the invention relates to living radical polymerization initiators of the tellurium type, processes for preparing macro living radial polymerization initiators, living radical polymers and block polymers with use of the initiator, and these macro living radical polymerization initiators and polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Living radical polymerization is a polymerization process which is adapted for precision control of molecular structures while ensuring convenience and universal usefulness of radical polymerization, and is powerful means for preparing novel polymer materials. Georges et al has made a report on a typical example of living radical polymerization using TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy) as an initiator (publication of JP-A No. 1994-199916) .<br>
This process makes it possible to control molecular weights and molecular weight distributions, but requires a high polymerization temperature of 130"C and is difficult to use for monomers having a thermally unstable functional group. The process<br>
is also unsuited to the control of modification of terminal functional groups of high molecular weight compounds.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an organotellurium compound which is useful as a living radical polymerization initiator and which makes possible precision control of molecular weights and molecular weight distributions (PD = Mw/Mn) under mild conditions, a process for preparing the compound, a process for producing a polymer with use of the compound, and the polymer.<br>

Next, a detailed description will be given of the process for preparing a polymer.<br>
A vinyl monomer and a living radical polymerization initiator represented by the formula (4) are mixed together in a container with the air therein replaced by an inert gas. The inert gas to be used is, for example, nitrogen, argon, helium or the like. Preferable are argon and nitrogen. Nitrogen is more preferable. While the amounts of the vinyl monomer and the living radical polymerization initiator may be suitably adjusted in accordance with the molecular weight or molecular weight distribution of the living radical polymer to be obtained, usually 5 to 10,000 equivalents, preferably 50 to 5,000 equivalents, of the vinyl monomer is used per equivalent of the initiator. Although the reaction is conducted in the absence of solvent, a solvent may be used which is generally used for radical polymerization. Examples of solvents usable are benzene, toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetone, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, etc. DMF is preferred. While the amount of solvent to be used may be adjusted suitably, 0.01 to 1 ml, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 ml of solvent is used per gram of vinyl monomer.<br>
The mixture is then stirred. The reaction temperature and<br>
the reaction time may be adjusted suitably in accordance with the molecular weight or molecular weight distribution of the living radical polymer to be obtained. The mixture is stirred usually at 60 to 150°C for 5 to 100 hours, preferably at 80 to 120'C for 10 to 30 hours. The reaction is conducted usually under atmospheric pressure, but may be conducted at increased pressure or in a vacuum.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the solvent used and the remaining monomer are removed in a vacuum to take out the desired polymer, or the desired product is isolated by re-precipitation using a solvent wherein the product is insoluble. The reaction mixture can be treated by any method insofar as it causes no problem to the desired product.<br>
The living radical polymerization initiator of the present invention is adapted for excellent control of molecular weights and molecular weight distributions under very mild conditions.<br>
The living radical polymer to be obtained by the invention is adjustable in molecular weight according to the reaction time and the amount of organotellurium compound, and can be 500 to 1,000,000 in number average molecular weight. The invention is especially suitable for producing living radical polymers having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 50,000.<br>
The living radical polymer to be obtained by the invention is controlled to 1.05 to 1.50 in molecular weight distribution (PD = Mw/Mn). The molecular weight distribution is controllable to a narrower range of 1.05 to 1.30, a further narrower range of 1.05 to 1.20, a still narrower range of 1.05 to 1.15.<br>
It has been found that the living radical polymer of the<br>
present invention has a terminal group which is an alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aromatic heterocyclic group, or hydroxycarbonyl derived from the organotellurium compound and a growth terminal which is highly reactive tellurium. Accordingly, the organotellurium compound used for radical polymerization makes it easier to convert the terminal group to other functional group than in the case of the living radical polymer obtained by conventional living radical polymerization. The living radical polymer obtained according to the invention is therefore usable as a macro living radical polymerization initiator (macroinitiator).<br>
Stated more specifically, the use of the macro living radical polymerization initiator of the invention makes it possible to produce, for example, A-B diblock copolymers such as styrene-butyl acrylate, A-B-A triblock copolymers such as styrene-butyl acrylate-styrene and A-B-C triblock copolymers such as styrene-butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate. This is attributable to the fact that the initiator of the present invention is capable of controlling various types of vinyl monomers and that highly reactive tellurium exists at the growth terminal of the living radical polymer to be obtained with use of the initiator.<br>
Block copolymers can be produced by the processes to be described below in detail.<br>
Like the process for producing the living radical polymer described above, A-B diblock copolymers such as styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer are produced by mixing together styrene and a living radical polymerization initiator of the invention represented by the formula (4) to obtain polystyrene first and subsequently mixing butyl acrylate with the polymer to obtain<br>
styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer.<br>
A-B-A triblock copolymers or A-B-C triblock copolymers are produced by preparing an A-B diblock copolymer by the above process and thereafter mixing a vinyl monomer (A) or vinyl monomer (C) with the copolymer to obtain the triblock copolymer.<br>
Each block prepared may be subjected as it is to the subsequent reaction to produce the next block, or the completion of the first reaction may be followed by purification and then by the subsequent reaction to obtain the next block. The block copolymer can be isolated by the usual method.<br>

The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 3 minutes, carbon dioxide was forced into the mixture for 1 minute, and a transparent solution obtained was treated with 19.2 mg (0.60 mmole) of methanol. The resulting mixture was returned to room temperature. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was washed with water, and the aqueous layer was subjected to extraction with Et2O three times.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The invention provides organotellurium compounds and a process for preparing the same. The organotellurium compound is useful as a living radical polymerization initiator and adapted for precision control of molecular weights and molecular weight distributions under mild conditions. Living radical polymers obtained by polymerization have a terminal group which can be readily converted to other functional group. The living radical polymer obtained by the invention can therefore be used as a macro living radical polymerization initiator (macroinitiator).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
