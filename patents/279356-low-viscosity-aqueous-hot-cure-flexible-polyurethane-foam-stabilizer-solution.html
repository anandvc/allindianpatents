Goid schmidt GmbH, Essen<br>
Use of aqueous polyurethane hot soft foam stabilizing solutions of low viscosity having polyether siloxane in the production of polyurethane hot soft foams<br>
The subject matter of the present patent application relates to low-viscosity aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions containing polyethersiloxanes and to their use in the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams, and also to the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam produced by means of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution.<br>
Flexible polyurethane foams presently find diverse use in the manufacture of mattresses, upholstered furniture or automobile seats. They are produced by reaction of isocyanates with polyols. In the course of the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams, foam stabilizers serve to stabilize the expanding foam. In the absence of these stabilizers the surface tension of the reaction mixture during hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam production is too high, meaning that the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam would collapse in the course of production.<br>
Polyethersiloxanes in particular are used for stabilizing hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams.<br>
EP-A1 0 520 392 describes a surface-active composition for flexible polyurethane foams, that composition being a mixture comprising a component A) containing 99.98% to 90% by weight of a surface-active "nonhydrofyzing" siloxane polyether, which can be used in the production of conventional flexible polyurethane foams, said siloxane polyether containing siloxane chains with at least 26 Si atoms without capped end groups; and a component B) containing 0.02% to 10% by weight of a salt of organic acids having the general formula AaMm; the weight figures are based on the total weight of the siloxane polyether and of the salt of the organic acid.<br>
A very high concentration of polyethersiloxane in the foam stabilizer mixture leads typically to an increase in the viscosity. A disadvantage is that a high viscosity is detrimental to good flow behavior on the part of the foam stabilizer mixture during processing. A further disadvantage is that rapid and at the same time homogeneous distribution of such a foam<br>
 <br>
stabilizer mixture in the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam reaction mixture is not adequately possible.<br>
The reason why the high viscosity of poiyethersiloxane-containing foam stabilizer mixtures is a disadvantage particularly in the context of the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam is that it hinders pumping in the mixing head or even makes such pumping impossible. Within the art, a viscosity of 5000 mPa-s is regarded as the upper limit Consequently, foam stabilizer mixtures of this kind are mixed with organic solvents, such as low molecular mass diols, exemplified by ethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol or diethylene glycol. In some cases short-chain polyethers, vegetable oils or technical solvents, such as propylene carbonate or phthalate compounds, are used as well. The disadvantage of all of these solvents is that they introduce into the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam an extraneous substance not actually required for the foam's production. Furthermore, to a greater or lesser extent, these substances are environmentally hazardous and combustible.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, to provide a low-viscosity foam stabilizer mixture containing a high concentration of polyethersiloxane that avoids at least one of the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
The object of the present invention is achieved by means of a low-viscosity aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution which can be used in the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams, wherein the low-viscosity aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution comprises the following components:<br>

with the proviso that x + y + z + t&gt;3, and that at least one substituent R\ R2, R3, R4, and<br>
R5 is a polyether of the formula II, the weight fraction of the aforementioned components<br>
being selected such that the overall weight fraction of the components does not exceed<br>
100% by weight, based on the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution.<br>
In terms of the distribution of the monomer units to the polymer chain, the polyether of formula II may be random, blockwise or changing with a gradient.<br>
The polyethersiloxane component in the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution may also be composed of two or more polyethersiloxanes of formula I.<br>
The weight fraction of the aforementioned components, unless specified otherwise, is selected such that the total weight fraction of the components does not exceed 100% by<br>

Unless specified otherwise, the weight figures are based on the total weight of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution.<br>
Unless specified otherwise, the respective components may take the form of individual components or of a mixture. It is in fact preferred for the polyethersiloxane to constitute a mixture. It may likewise be preferable for the surfactant to take the form of a surfactant mixture.<br>
The polyethersiloxane, organic surfactant, water, organic solvent additions, and, where appropriate, further additives, compounds which can be used in accordance with the invention, are in each case different from one another. By way of example, the surfactants comprise no inventively useful polyethersiloxane of the formula I or the organic solvent additions comprise no organic surfactant, and vice versa.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention exhibit a much lower viscosity than the otherwise identical compositions from which surfactant is absent.<br>

 <br>
It is also preferred if the iow-viscosity aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention containing &gt; 50% to  0.1 Pa-s to  0.3 Pa-s to  0.4 Pa-s to 
As organic solvent additions it is possible to use solvents selected from the group encompassing dipropylene glycol, butyl diglycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, phthalates, polyethers, animal and vegetable oils, mineral oils and/or antifreeze agents in liquid form.<br>
With particular preference the organic solvent additions comprise an antifreeze agent selected from the group encompassing dipropylene glycol and/or propylene glycol.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention it may also be the case that no organic solvents are added to the low-viscosity aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution.<br>

The values of x, y, z, t u, v, w, m, a, b, c, d and/or g therefore correspond to average values.<br>

 <br>

preference 5 to 30,<br>
f	&gt; 0 - 120, preferably 1 to 50, more preferably 5 to 40, and with particular<br>
preference 10 to 30, where e + f = 15.<br>
PE here may also represent a mixture of different polyethers, all of which, however, are shown by formula IV.<br>
The use of water over organic solvents has the further advantage that water is of almost unlimited availability and is nontoxic and nonflammable. On cleaning, furthermore, aqueous solutions are easy to remove and can be disposed of without technical complexity. A further advantage is that the safety provisions for the storage of aqueous solutions are generally lesastrict Viewed overall, the use of water as solvent makes it possible to reduce significantly the complexity and, consequently, the production costs of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention as compared with nonaqueous systems.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention comprises principally water as solvent.<br>
The polyethersiloxanes which can be used in accordance with the invention are prepared in general by the platinum-catalyzed addition reaction of a siioxane containing silane hydrogen atoms with linear polyalkylene oxide polyethers whose linear chain is capped at the reactive end by an alkyleneoxy group, such as allyloxy or vinyloxy, and at the other end by, for example, an alkoxy, aralkyloxy or acyloxy group. The polyethers. are prepared by alkoxylating ally! alcohol or higher molecular mass hydroxy-functional allyl or vinyl compounds.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively the OH groups of the poiyethers can be endcapped not until after the hydrosiiylaticn. in that case only, or predominantly, uncapped poiyethers are used for the hydrosiiyiation.<br>
The preparation of polyethersiloxanes is set out generally and in patents including EP-A1 0 520 392 and EP-A1 1 350 804, and incoporated here by reference.<br>
The end group of the polyether may, starting from the alkoxylation, initially have a free OH function. This hydroxyl group may also be present at least in part in the polyethersiloxane of the invention. In the case of the preferred polyethersiloxanes, however, the end groups are wholly or at least predominantly endcapped. This can be done by esterification, preferably acetylation, or by ethehfication, preferably methylation, of the free OH function.<br>
The polyethersiloxanes which can be used in accordance with the invention may in particular be highly stable to hydrolysis, so that the polyethersiloxanes of the invention can be designated hydrolytically stable.<br>
Polyethersiloxanes which can be used in accordance with the invention have a high molecular weight, making their neat viscosity too high for direct processing. The viscosity of neat polyethersiloxanes of this kind may be &gt; 1000 mPas at 25°C; for the majority of polyethersiloxanes that are used for stabilizing hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam, the figure is more than 3000 mPa-s at 25°C; for certain representatives of the polyethersiloxanes of the invention the viscosity may even be just below 6000 mPas at 25°C. In the context of the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam, however, high viscosities constitute a problem, one reason for this being the hindrance to pumping in the mixing head.<br>
In the prior art, therefore, polyethersiloxanes have been diluted with organic solvents, such dilution being associated with the disadvantages described above. Typical polyethersiloxane contents in prior-art hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizers are 50% to 70% by weight, the remainder being organic solvent.<br>
The use of water as a solvent for polyethersiloxanes used as a stabilizer in hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam was not hitherto considered, since when mixtures of inventive polyethersiloxanes with water are prepared in the concentration range from 40% to 80% by weight of polyethersiloxane, a drastic increase in viscosity is observed in the mixture. The viscosities that come about significantly exceed the level of the polyethersiloxane alone. The reason for the increase in viscosity is the appearance of lyotropically liquid-crystalline<br>
 <br>
phases. These phases are- based on a muitidimensionaily ordered packing of amphiphiiic surfactant molecules. Such amphiphiiic surfactant molecules also include, for example, the poiyethersiioxanes used in accordance with the invention. Lyorropic mesophases of this kind often have an anisotropic distribution of physical properties in space. Depending on the particular mode of packing, the viscosities attain values which completely prohibit flow of the material and hence produce a gellike character.<br>
For instance, an aqueous solution with a polyethersiloxane fraction of 40% by weight, based on the aqueous solution, already has a viscosity of well above 5 Pa-s, and so at this level it is no longer possible to talk of low-viscosity aqueous solutions. Aqueous solutions with a polyethersiloxane fraction of 50%. to 70% by weight have even higher viscosities, usually well above 50 Pa-s. The viscosity maximum is reached at approximately 60% by weight polyethersiloxane and 40% by weight water.<br>
On account of their low concentration, aqueous solutions with a polyethersiloxane fraction of 
Aqueous solutions having a polyethersiloxane content of &gt; 80% by weight are likewise unsuitable on account of the high viscosity. An amount of water 
Low-viscosity aqueous hot-Gure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions to which the invention gives preference have a polyethersiloxane content of 40% to 70% by weight with a ■ viscosity 
It has now been found, surprisingly, that, through the addition of organic surfactants, it is<br>
 <br>
possible to suppress the incidence of the high viscosities at 40 to 70% by weight polyethersiloxane in the aqueous blend. Particular anionic surfactants were very effective in this context.<br>
Preferred aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions have a low viscosity and hence a good rheology. Tne hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution in accordance with the present invention may possess a viscosity of &gt; 100 mPa-s to  500 mPa-s to  700 mPa-s to  900 Pa-s to  100 mPa-s were measured using a cone/plate geometry (diameter = 50.0 mm, angle = 0.981°). Samples with a viscosity 
An advantage is that it is possible to obtain stable, storable hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions which, in spite of the use of water as a solvent within the claimed ranges, exhibit no tendency, or virtually no tendency, during storage of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution, to form precipitates which settle at the base of a vessel or rise. This is advantageous because in this way it is possible to obtain hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions with effective homogeneous distribution of the components.<br>
A further advantage of these aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention is that they remain clear and homogeneous even on an increase in temperature. Thus in certain cases no changes were observed in the aqueous solutions up to well above 50°C.<br>
A further advantage of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the<br>
 <br>
invention is that small amounts can be added, 5% to 10% by weight for example, of a component which functions as an antifreeze agent. Suitable substances are, for example, low molecular mass monoois or diols. such as ethanol, isopropanol, dipropyiene glycol ethylene glycol or butyldiglycol. Frost-stabilized aqueous hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention of this kind do not freeze even at - 20°C.<br>
Freezing of the hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution wouid be a great problem, since in that case only the water would freeze. Polyethersiloxanes are not incorporated into the ice crystal structure, and on thawing a phase separation would be observed which would be eliminable only by means of intensive stirring.<br>
However, frost-stabilized aqueous hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solutions are of very high viscosity at low temperatures. This process, however, does not present a problem, since as a general rule the raw materials for hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam production are conditioned to room temperature (23°C). After the cold, frost-stabilized aqueous hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution has been warmed to room temperature, the low-viscosity hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution is obtained again.<br>
A further advantage of the hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention is that it is now also possible without problems to add additional substances which are very hydrophilic and which in pure polyethersiloxanes or in solutions of polyethersiloxanes in organic solvents do not dissolve at all or at least only dissolve to a very incomplete extent. These substances are, on the one hand, saltlike additives and, on the other, polyhydroxy-functional additives. As far as the first group is concerned, it is possible for example to add lithium salts, sodium salts or potassium salts. Such salts also act as antifreeze agents. The salts added may also exert a catalytic effect during the production of the hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam. The fraction of the additionally added saltlike compounds, based on the hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution, can be preferably = 0% to = 5% by weight. As electrolytes from the group of the inorganic salts it is possible to employ a wide number of very different kinds of salts. Preferred cations are the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, preferred anions the halides, sulfates, and carboxylates - such as, for example, alkali metal benzoates or.alkali metal acetates.<br>
The hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention may with preference additionally comprise polyhydroxy-functional additives which possess a hydroxyl group functionality of = 3 and which in the context of hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam<br>
 <br>
production act as crosslinkers. The fraction of these poiyhydroxy-functional compounds may be between = 0% and = 10% by weight, based on the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam siabiiizer solution. The poiyhydroxy-functional compounds may with preference be selected from the group encompassing glycerol, trimethyiolpropane, pentaerythrito!, water-solubie carbohydrates of low molecular mass, especially monomeric or dimeric glycosides, and water-soluble sugar alcohols, preferably sorbitol.<br>
The use of poiyhydroxy-functional compounds having a functionality = 3 may be advantageous, since in the production of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam these compounds may be able to contribute to chemical stabilization through increased crosslinking, in addition to the physical stabilization through the polyethersiloxane. When added to aqueous stabilizer solutions of low viscosity, these crosslinkers permit additional control over the foaming behavior, which was hitherto possible only by separate addition of crosslinkers.<br>
Furthermore, the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention may further comprise typical additives such as catalysts, blowing agents, biocide and/or flame retardants. Biocides may, where appropriate, reduce the risk of microbial contamination of the aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam solution and hence increase the storage life. Biocides which can suitably be used are, in particular, biocides as recorded in the European Biocidal Products Directive 98/8/EC, List of Substances.<br>
Other additional additives that can be used include antioxidants. These antioxidants may extend the oxidation stability of the aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution. Suitable antioxidants are preferably sterically hindered phenols such as, for example, butyiated hydroxytoluene (BHT).<br>
As additional additives it is also possible, furthermore, to use buffer substances, in order to set a neutral or slightly basic pH. Suitable buffer substances are preferably phosphate buffers, borate buffers, amino acids, carbonate buffers, or buffers based on the salts of tertiary amines.<br>
Polyethersiloxanes with a broad molecular weight distribution can be used, giving stable hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions. In accordance with the present invention it is possible to use polyethersiloxanes which have a molecular weight of 10 000 g/mol to 50 000 g/mol, preferably of 13-000 g/mol to 40 000 g/mol, and more preferably of 15 000 g/mol to 35 000 g/mol.<br>
 <br>
It has also emerged that hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions containing polyethersiioxanes in which the polyether units possess a molar mass of 500 g/mo! to 7000 g/mol, preferably 1000 g/mol to 6000 g/mol, more preferably 2000 g/mol to 5000 g/mol, have good product properties in terms of stability of the solution and/or concentration distribution of the polyethersiloxane component. It is therefore particularly preferred for at least one polyether unit to have an average molar mass of Mn &gt; 2100 g/mol.<br>
The fraction of ethylene oxide in a polyether unit that can be used with preference in accordance with the invention may be 10% to 100% by weight, the amount of propylene oxide then being adapted accordingly; in other words at 10% by weight ethylene oxide, the propylene oxide fraction in the polyether unit is 90% by weight, and, if the ethylene oxide content is 100% by weight, the fraction of propylene oxide in the polyether unit accounts for 0% by weight.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, however, the fraction of propylene oxide in the polyether unit may also be 10% to 100% by weight, in which case the ethylene oxide content is then adapted accordingly; in other words, at 10% by weight propylene oxide, the ethylene oxide fraction in the polyether unit is 90% by weight, and, if the propylene oxide content is 100% by weight, the fraction of ethylene oxide in the polyether unit accounts for 0% by weight.<br>
Good properties for the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution in terms of pore distribution and quality of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam are obtained if the propylene oxide fraction, averaged over all of the polyether units of the polyethersiloxane, is 40% to 90% by weight, preferably &gt; 50% by weight, more preferably &gt; 55% by weight, and with particular preference &gt; 60% by weight.<br>
In addition, however, it is also possible to incorporate further alkylene oxides into the polyethers. They include, in particular, butylene oxide, dodecene oxide, and styrene oxide.<br>
For use in connection with the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams particular suitability in accordance with the invention is given to hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions wherein a hot-cure flexiblepolyurethane foam stabilizer solution comprises:<br>
 <br>
-	&gt; 42% to  45% to  47% to 
-	&gt; 1 % to  2% to  4% to 
-	&gt; 15% to  20% to  30% to 
-	&gt; 0% to  1% to  2% to 
A/here appropriate the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution may contain urther additives as an additional component. The fraction of the above components of the lot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution is selected in each case such that the otal fraction of the components does not exceed 100% by weight.<br>
Dne inventively preferred hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution comprises:<br>
-	&gt; 45% to 
-	&gt; 1% to  2% by weight to 
-	&gt; 30% to  35% to 
-	&gt; 1 % to  3% to 
Vhere appropriate the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution may contain urther additives as an additional component. The fraction of the above components of the lot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution is selected in each case such that the total fraction of the components does not exceed 100% by weight.<br>
It is self-evident that the respective components are matched to one another in such a way as to minimize the viscosity. The inventively desired viscosity ranges have already been described above for the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution. The desired viscosity can be set by appropriately raising or lowering the organic surfactant fraction and/or by means of the ratio of water to polyethersiloxane. It is possible where appropriate to exert further influence over the viscosity of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution by the corresponding addition of inorganic salts.<br>
 <br>
In order to ensure a good concentration distribution of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution in the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam reaction mixture, it is possible with preference to use homogeneous and transparent solutions of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution. Transparent hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of this kind may take the form, for example, of a clear or slightly cloudy solution. Suitable transparent hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions may for example also have an opaque shimmer.<br>
Hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions containing floes or a sediment are not - in accordance with the invention - suitable hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions if the viscosity is above 5000 mPa-s.<br>
Floes and/or the development of a sediment can be avoided by appropriately setting the proportions of water, surfactant, and polyethersiloxane, where increasing the surfactant concentration and at the same time lowering the polyethersiloxane concentration produces the inventively preferred, low-viscosity hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions.<br>
The hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention are storage-stable at room temperature. It has emerged that hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention exhibit no phase separation and/or precipitation over a period of at least 14 days. The high storage stability and also the avoidance of precipitation, such as floes, can be set via the proportion of the components: organic surfactant, polyethersiloxane, water, and, where appropriate, inorganic salts.<br>
In accordance with the present invention preferred hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions contain no floes and/or sediment.<br>
In spite of their high water content, the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention are also notable for an increased cloud point as compared with the blends of polyethersiloxanes in water without surfactant. Preferred hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions of the invention have a cloud point of &gt; 40°C, preferably &gt; 50°C, and more preferably &gt; 60°C.<br>

Suitable betaines. are those compounds with the formula R(R')2N+ R2COO-, in which R is a C6-Ci8 hydrocarbyl group, each R1 is generally CVC3 alkyl, and R2 is a CrC5 hydrocarbyl group. Preferred betaines are Ci2-C18 dimethylammoniohexanoate and the C10-C18 acylamido-propane- (or -ethane-)dimethyl-(or diethyl-)betaines. Complex betaine surfactants are likewise suitable in accordance with the invention.<br>
The amphoteric surfactant may with particular preference be selected from the group encompassing amphoacetates, amphodiacetates, glycinates, amphopropionates, sultaines, amine oxides and/or betaines.<br>
A further subject of the present invention relates to a hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer blend comprising amine, poryol and/or water, the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer blend containing at least 40% by weight of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention, based on the total weight of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer blend.<br>
Both the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention and/or the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer blend of the invention can be used for producing hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam.<br>
By way of example, the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can be used directly, i.e., without further additions, in the production of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams.<br>
 <br>
By polyurethane foam is meant, generally speaking, foamed polymeric materials which form when polyfunctions! isocyanates react with poiyois. Tne linking structural element formed is in this case the urethane moiety. Water can be used as a blowing agent, in that case carbon dioxide and the corresponding amine are formed,- the amine reacting with further isocyanate to give a urea group. The polyurethane foam may be constructed on a majority basis from urea groups, as well as urethane groups.<br>
The hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam material of the invention is preferably a flexible foam based on polyether polyols. The hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam material of the invention may further take the form of slabstock foam or molded foam.<br>
Under compressive stress the deformation resistance of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam material is relatively low (DIN 7726).<br>
Typical figures for the compressive stress at 40% compression of a hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam material are between 1 kPa and 10 kPa (procedure in accordance with DIN EN IS03386-1/2).<br>
The cell structure of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam material is predominantly open-celled.<br>
The density of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam of the invention is situated preferably in a range from 5 to 80 kg/mz, in particular in a range from 7 to 50 kg/'m2, with very particular preference in a range from 10 to 30 kg/m2 (measured in accordance with DIN EN ISO 845, DIN EN ISO 823).<br>
The hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams can be obtained from the reaction of polyols with isocyanates using a hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention and/or further components.<br>
By means of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention it is possible to produce hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams having for example a pore size distribution in the range from 5 to 25 cells/cm.<br>
As a chemical blowing agent for producing the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam materials it is possible with preference to use water, which on its reaction with the isocyanate groups<br>
 <br>
releases carbon dioxide. Water is used preferably in an amount of 0.2 to 6 parts by weight (all parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of polyol), with particular preference in an amount of 1.5 to 5.0 parts by weight. Together with or instead of water it is also possible to employ blowing agents that act physically, examples being carbon dioxide, acetone, hydrocarbonts, such as n-pentane, isopentane or cyciopentane, cyclohexane or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, tetrafiuoroethane, pentafluoropropane, heptafluoropropane, pentafluorobutane, hexafiuorobutane or dichloromonofiuoroethane. The amount of the physical blowing agent is in that case preferably in the range between 1 to 15 parts by weight, in particular 1 to 10 parts by weight, the amount of water preferably being in the range between 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, in particular 1 to 5 parts by weight. Carbon dioxide is preferred among the physical blowing agents, and is used preferably in combination with water as the chemical blowing agent.<br>
Suitable isocyanates include the aliphatic, cycioaliphatic, araliphatic and, preferably aromatic polyfunctional isocyanates that are known per se. With particular preference isocyanates are used in a range from 80 to 120 mol% relative to the sum of the isocyanate-consuming components.<br>
Specific examples that may be mentioned include the following: alkylene diisocyanates having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkylene radical, such as 1,12-dodecane diisocyanate, 2-ethyltetramethylene 1,4-diisocyanate, 2-methylpentamethylene 1,5-diisocyanate, tetramethylene 1,4-diisocyanate, and, preferably, hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate, cycioaliphatic diisocyanates, such as cyclohexane 1,3- and -1,4-diisocyanate, and also any desired mixtures of these isomers, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethy!-5-<br>
isocyanatomethyicyclohexane (IPDI), 2,4- and 2,6-hexahydrotolyiene diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, 4,4'-, 2,2'-, and 2,4'-dicyclohexy!methane diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, and, preferably, aromatic di- and polyisocyanates, such as, for example, 2,4- and 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, 4,4'-, 2,4'-, and 2,2'-dipheny!methane diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, mixtures of 4,4'- and 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanates, polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates, mixtures of 4,4'-, 2,4'-, and 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanates and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates (crude MDI), and mixtures of crude MDI and tolylene diisocyanates. The organic di- and polyisocyanates can be used individually or in the form of their mixtures. Particular preference is given to mixtures of polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanate with diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the fraction of 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate being preferably &gt; 30% by weight.<br>
 <br>
Use is also made advantageously of what are called modified polyfunctional jsocyanates, i.e., products obtained by chemical reaction of organic di- and/or polyisocyanates. By way of example mention may be made of di- and/or poiyisocyanates containing ester, urea, biuret, allophanate, carbodiimide, isocyanurate, uretdione and/or urethane groups. Specific examples that are suitable include the following: modified 4,4'-diphenyimethane diisocyanate, modified 4,4'- and 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate mixtures, modified crude MDI or 2,4-and/or 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, organic, preferably aromatic polyisocyanates containing urethane groups, having NCO contents of 43% to 15% by weight, preferably from 31% to 21% by weight, based on the total weight, examples being reaction products with low molecular mass diols, triols, dialkylene glycols, trialkylene glycols or polyoxyalkylene glycols having molecular weights up to 6000, in particular with molecular weights up to 1500, which can be used as di- and/or polyoxyalkylene glycols individually or as mixtures. Examples that may be mentioned include the following: diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethene glycols, triols and/or tetraols. Also suitable are NCO-containing prepolymers having NCO contents of 25% to 3.5% by weight, preferably of 21% to 14% by weight, based on the total weight, prepared from the polyester polyols and/or preferably polyether polyols described below and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, mixtures of 2,4'- and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 2,4-and/or 2,6-tolylene diisocyanates or crude MDI. Others which have proven appropriate are liquid polyisocyanates containing carbodiimide groups and/or isocyanurate rings, having NCO contents of 43% to 15%, preferably 31% to 21% by weight, based on the total weight, based for example on 4,4'-, 2,4'-, and/or 2,2'-diphenyimethane diisocyanate and/or 2,4-and/or 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate.<br>
The modified polyisocyanates may be mixed with one another or with nonmodified organic polyisocyanates, such as, for example, 2,4'-, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, crude MDI, 2,4- and/or 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate.<br>
The following have proven particularly appropriate as organic polyisocyanates and are therefore employed with preference: toluylene diisocyanate, mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers, mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyphenylpolymethyl polyisocyanate or toluene diisocyanate with diphenylmethane diisocyanate and/or polyphenylpolymethyl polyisocyanate, or so-called prepolymers. Particular preference is given to using tolylene diisocyanate in the process of the invention.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment the organic and/or modified organic polyisocyanates used are mixtures of 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate with 2,6-tolylene<br>
 <br>
diisocyanate, having a 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate fraction of 80% by weight.<br>
Suitable polyols are those having at least two H atoms thai are reactive toward isocyanate groups; preference is given to using polyether polyols. Such polyether poiyois can be prepared by known processes, as for example by anionic polymerization of afkylene oxides in the presence of alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alkoxides as catalysts, and with addition of at least one starter molecule containing 2 to 3 attached reactive hydrogen atoms, or by cationic polymerization of alkylene oxides in the presence of Lewis acids such as, for example, antimony pentachloride or boron fluoride etherate, or by double metal cyanide catalysis. Suitable alkylene oxides contain 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkylene radical. Examples of tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-propylene oxide, 1,2- and 2,3-butylene oxide; preference is given to using ethylene oxide and/or 1,2-propylene oxide. The alkylene oxides can be used individually, in alternation in succession, or as mixtures. Suitable starter molecules include water and 2- and 3-hydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, propane-1,2- and -1,3-diol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, etc. Polyfunctional polyols as well, such as sugars, can be used as starters.<br>
The polyether polyols, preferably polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene polyols, possess a functionality of 2 to 5 and number-averaged molecular weights in the range from 500 to 8000, preferably 800 to 3500.<br>
Where appropriate, flame retardants as well are added to the starting materials, preferably those which are liquid and/or are soluble in one or more of the components used for production of the foam. Commerciafly customary phosphorus fiame retardants are employed with preference, examples being tricresyl phosphate, tris(2-chloroethy1) phosphate, tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate, tris(2,3-dibromopropyi) phosphate, tris(1,3-dichioropropyl) phosphate, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethylenediphosphate, trisbutoxyethyl phosphate, dimethyl methanephosphonate, diethyl ethanephosphonate, and diethyl diethanolaminomethylphosphonate. Likewise suitable are halogen- and/or phosphorus-containing flame-retardant polyols and/or melamine. In addition it is also possible to use melamine. The flame retardancy is preferably in an amount of not more than 35% by weight, preferably not more than 20% by weight, based on the polyol component. Further examples of surface-active additives which can be used as well where appropriate are foam stabilizers and also cell regulators, reaction retardants, stabilizers, flame retardants, dyes, and also substances having fungistatic and bacteriostatic activity. Details on usage and mode of action of these adjuvants are described in G. Oertel (ed.): "Kunststoff-Handbuch", volume VII, Carl HanserVerlag, 3rd edition, Munich 1993, pp. 110-123.<br>
 <br>
In addition, in the process of the invention, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight, in particular 0.1 to 0.2 part by weight, of catalysts for the blowing reaction can be used. These catalysts for the blowing reaction are selected from the group of tertiary amines [triethyienediamine, triethylamine, tetramethylbutanediamine, dimethyicyclohexylamine, bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether, dimethylaminoethoxyethanoi, bis(3-dimethylaminopropyl)amine, N,N,N'-trimethylaminoethylethanolamine, 1,2-dimethyiimidazole, N-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, N,N-dimethylethanolamine,N,N-diethylethanolamine, 1,8-diazabicyclo-5,4,0-undecene, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N,N,N',N",N'"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, N,N,N',N",N'"-pentamethyldipropylenetriamine, N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, 2,2'-dimorpholinodiethyl ether, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, N,N',N"-tris(dimethylaminopropyl)hexahydrotriazine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, tris(3-dimethylaminopropyl)amine, and/or tetramethylpropanamine]. Likewise suitable are acid-blocked derivatives of the tertiary amines. In one particular embodiment the amine used is dimethylethanolamine or bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether. In another embodiment the amine used is triethyienediamine.<br>
In the process of the invention it is also possible to use preferably 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight, in particular 0.1 to 0.3 part by weight, of catalysts for the gel reaction. The catalysts for the gel reaction are selected from the group of organometallic compounds and the metal salts of the following metals: tin, zinc, tungsten, iron, bismuth, and titanium. One particular embodiment uses catalysts from the group of the tin carboxyiates. Very particular preference is given in that context to tin (2-ethylhexanoate) and tin ricinoleate. Tin 2-ethyIhexanoate in particular is important for the inventive production of a hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam. Furthermore, preference is also given to tin compounds having fully or partly covalently attached organic radicals. Particular preference in this context is given to using dibutyitin dilaurate.<br>

In a further application the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can be used for low-pressure machines. In that case the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution can be<br>
 <br>
introduced separately into the mixing chamber. In a further version of the process, the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can also be admixed upstream of the mixing chamber into one of the components which subsequently enters the mixing chamber. This admixing can also take place in the raw materials tank.<br>
In a further application the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can also be used on high-pressure machines. In that case the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution can be added directly into the mixing head.<br>
In a further version of the process, the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can also be admixed upstream of the mixing chamber into one of the components which subsequently enters the mixing chamber. This admixing can also take place in the raw materials tank.<br>
The plant for the production of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam can be operated continuously or batchwise. The use of the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention for continuous foaming is particularly advantageous. The foaming operation in that case may take place in either a horizontal or a vertical direction. In a further embodiment, the low-viscosity, aqueous hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solution of the invention can be utilized for the C02-technology.<br>
in a further embodiment, foaming may also take place in molds.<br>
The gas permeability of the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam of the invention is situated preferably in a range from 1 to 300 mm ethanol column, in particular in a range from 7 to 25 mm ethanol column (measured by measuring the pressure difference on flow through a foam sample. For that purpose a foam disk 5 cm thick is placed on a smooth surface. A plate (10 cm x 10 cm) weighing 800 g and having a central hole (diameter 2 cm) and a hose connection is placed on the foam sample. A constant air stream of 8 l/min is passed into the foam sample via the central hole. The pressure difference occurring (relative to unhindered outflow) is determined by means of an ethanol column in a graduated pressure meter. The more closed the foam, the greater the pressure which is built up and the greater the extent to which the surface of the ethanol column is pushed downward, and the greater the values measured).<br>
The present invention additionally provides a product comprising a hot-cure flexible<br>
 <br>
polyurethane foam produced using an inventive hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer solution and/or a hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foam stabilizer blend.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is elucidated in more detail with reference to the examples and tables below. For these examples a typical polyethersiloxane for stabilizing hot-cure flexible poiyurethane foams was produced and was characterized in terms of its various blends.<br>
Polyethersiloxane A<br>
Polyethersiloxane A is an inventive polyethersiloxane of the following formula:<br>
 <br>
in which, o = 4, n = 70, PE = polyether = mixture of two polyethers: 37.5 eq% of a methylated polyether with Mn = 3800 g/mol, prepared from 58% by weight propylene oxide and 42% by weight ethylene oxide, and 62.5 eq% of a methylated polyether with Mn = 600 g/mol, prepared from 100% by weight ethylene oxide.<br>
Preparation of polyethersiloxane A:<br>
The polyethersiloxane is prepared from the corresponding, pendantty Si-H-functional polydimethylsiloxane and from the corresponding ally! poiyether(s). The siloxane is prepared in accordance with the known processes, described for example in EP 0499200, by equilibration. The allyl polyether is obtained by aikoxyiating alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, dodecene oxide or styrene oxide with allyl alcoho! as starter in an anionic polymerization. Examples of the synthesis options for allyl polyethers of this kind are disclosed in EP 0822218. For the hydrosilylation, a 30% by weight excess of the allyl polyethers) over the stoichiometrically required amount is added. A typical platinum catalyst for the hydrosilylation reaction, such as cis-Pt or hexachloroplatnic acid, is introduced in an amount of 10 ppm. The reaction mixture is heated at 90°C for 6 h for the reaction, the residual SiH function content being determined at intervals by volumetric reaction with potassium butoxide solution and determination of the hydrogen formed. The reaction is at an end when &gt; 98% of the Si-H functions employed have undergone reaction. The excess polyether present in the reaction product remains in the reaction mixture. The product thus obtained is used directly as polyethersiloxane A for the further tests. The preparation of Si-C¬linked polyethersiloxanes of this kind has already been described frequently in the literature,<br>
 <br>
as for example in US 4,147,847, EP 0493836, and US 4,855,379, fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Blending of polyethersiloxane A<br>
For the purpose of illustrating the invention, the abovementioned polyethersiloxane, by way of example, was blended with various organic solvents, with water, and with water containing surfactants. The viscosity of each of the samples was measured.<br>
Blending of polyethersiloxane A with water:<br>
In a mixing series the polyethersiloxane A was mixed in 10% by weight steps with water and<br>
the viscosities were ascertained.<br>
 <br>
It is apparent that the course of the viscosity between the pure water and the pure polyethersiloxane is in no way linear. Instead, beginning at 30% by weight of polyethersiloxane in the mixture with water, there is a very significant increase in the viscosity. The maximum is reached at about 60% by weight polyethersiloxane in the mixture with water. There it is possible for values up to more than 100 Pa-s to occur. Such high viscosities result in a gellike behavior. If the fraction of polyethersiloxane is increased further, the viscosity then drops again. At about 80% by weight, the region of drastic increase in viscosity is at an end. The viscosity then falls in the direction of the pure polyethersiloxane. A graph of the viscosity figures is atttached in Fig. 1. It is obvious that the preparation of ready-<br>
 <br>
to-use, low-viscosity hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer solutions - viscosity = 5000 mPa-s - with water as solvent is not possible without further additions in the range from 40% to 80% by weight polyethersiloxane in the mixture.<br>
Addition of various adjuvants to the mixtures prepared from polyethersiloxane and water<br>
Various adjuvants were then added to the pre-prepared blends of polyethersiloxane and water. The amounts by weight of the adjuvants, in % by weight, based on the polyethersiloxane/water mixture (100% by weight), were weighed out and added to the mixture. The absolute amounts of polyethersiloxane and water in the mixture including surfactant are lowered as a result by the corresponding factor, but the ratio between polyethersiloxane and water is retained (which is very important for the phase behavior). First of all an attempt was made to achieve a desired low-viscosity solution of the two polyethersiloxanes in water by addition of a typical organic solvent for polyethersiloxanes. The solvent used was dipropylene glycol (DPG). DPG is the standard solvent for hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizers. In this case an amount of 5% by weight DPG was added to the blends of the polyethersiloxanes and water.<br>
 <br>
It is apparent that the addition of 5% by weight DPG does lower the viscosity somewhat, but there is still a drastic increase in viscosity observed. The addition of higher quantities of DPG<br>
 <br>
does nothing to alter this situation, as can be inferred from the comparative examples in Table III. As well as the DPG, a liquid polyether (IPE) was used here as solvent. This 1PE is a liquid poiyether prepared starting from n-butanol, with randomly distributed incorporation of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, having an average moiar mass of approximately 1000 g/mol. 42% by weight is propylene oxide and 58% by weight ethylene oxide. This poiyether is prepared in analogy to the allyl-functional polyethers described above, by alkoxyiation.<br>
 <br>
Although the increase in viscosity is more moderate, it is still the case that a viscosity above 5 Pas is observed, which rules out such blends for industrial use as poryurethane stabilizers.<br>
In contrast to the solvents mentioned above, surfactants or surfactant mixtures were added to the following blends of the polyethersiloxane A with water. As far as the surfactants are concerned, blends with water are in some cases customary in the art In such cases, the aim when preparing the sample was to add 5% by weight of pure surfactant; in other words, in the case of dilute surfactants, a correspondingly greater amount of a surfactant blend was employed. The water present in some cases in the surfactant blend was taken into account with regard to the total water content of the polyethersiloxane/water/surfactant mixture.<br>
First of all a 2-ethylhexylsulfonate-Na salt was used with the trade name Rewopol® D 510, available from Degussa. Rewopol® D 510 itself is a 40% by weight blend with 60% by weight water.<br>
Table IV Mixture of polyethersiloxane A and water and addition of 5% by weight<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Besides the use of surfactants, the combined use of surfactants and organic solvents may be sensible. This may be necessary particularly with a view to improving the freeze protection. Beiow, for this purpose, in addition, 5% by weight DPG was added to the samples from Table VI.<br>
 <br>
Comparing Table VI and Table VII, no marked change can be observed in the viscosity profile. The addition of DPG initially does not alter much about the viscosity-lowering properties of the addition of an organic surfactant to a mixture of polyethersiloxane and water, but may yet have further advantages such as, for example, greater antifreeze security.<br>
The polyethersiloxane was used, furthermore, in a blend with DPG (noninventive) and with water and organic surfactant (inventive example) when producing a hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam in the laboratory. The blends used in this case were as follows:<br>
60% by weight polyethersiloxane 40% by weight DPG<br>
 <br>
60% by weight polyethersiloxane<br>
35% by weight water<br>
5% by weight alkyibenzenesuifonate, Na<br>
The blends prepared in this way were then investigated in a typical hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam formulation:<br>
General formula for the production of experimental hot-cure flexible polyurethane foams:<br>
-100 parts by weight polyol (Desmophen® PU20WB01 from Bayer, OH number 56)<br>
- 5.0 parts by weight water (chemical blowing agent) (in the case of the water-containing<br>
polyethersiloxane blend, lower correspondingly)<br>
-1.0 part by weight polyethersiloxane blend<br>
-	0.15 part by weight amine catalyst (triethylenediamine)<br>
-	0.23 part by weight tin catalyst (tin 2-ethylhexanoate)<br>
-	5.0 parts by weight methylene chloride (additional physical blowing agent)<br>
- 63.04 parts by weight isocyanate (tolylene diisocyanate, TDl-80) (ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate-consuming reactive groups = 1.15)<br>
Procedure:<br>
Polyol, water, catalysts, and stabilizer were placed in a cardboard cup and mixed up using a stirring disk (45 s at 1000 rpm). Then the methylene chloride was added and mixing carried out again at 1000 rpm for 10 s. After that the isocyanate (TDl-80) was added and stirring was carried out again, at 2500 rpm, for 7 s. The mixture was then introduced into a box measuring 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm. During foaming, the rise height was measured by means of an ultrasound height measuring system. The rise time is the time which elapses until the foam has reached its maximum rise height. Settling refers to the subsidence of the foam surface after the hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam has blown. The settling is measured 3 minutes after blowing, in relation to the maximum rise height. The density was measured in accordance with DIN EN ISO 845 and DIN EN ISO 823. The cell count was taken using a magnifier with graduation, at three points, and the values were averaged.<br>
Table VIII Results of hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam test foaming<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the course of the test foamings it emerges that both blends of the polyethersiloxane show identical properties. With the test foamings, therefore, no effect of the solvent can be observed. In other hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam formulations, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out differences in the foaming behavior of a blend of polyethersiloxanes with organic solvents and water. Specifically, the absence of dipropylene glycol may also lead to more open foam structures. In the context of the relevant objective, a blend of polyethersiloxanes with a water/surfactant mixture can be classed as being useful as a hot-cure flexible polyurethane foam stabilizer.<br>
A final objective of interest concerns the type of surfactants which are able to result in the reduction in viscosity set out in this invention. To ascertain this, the polyethersiloxane was mixed with a wide variety of surfactants. The amount used of the pure surfactant in each case is 5% by weight in the mixture as a whole. Based on a mixture of polyethersiloxane and water without surfactant, the ratio set out in Tabie LX is found. The resulting viscosities are set out in Tables IX and X.<br>

The viscosities which result - for comparison - when 5% by weight DPG is added, with the ratio of polyethersiloxane A and water as in Table X, are as follows.<br>
Table XI Mixture of the polyethersiloxanes and water in the ratio of the surfactant serial experiments in<br>
Table X with 5% by weight added DPG<br>
 <br>
 <br>
It is apparent that for each of the surfactant groups listed (anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric) it is possible to find examples for which the viscosity in the biend with water and the surfactant is below the viscosity of 5 Pa-s. In principle it is not possible to except any organic surfactant groups. A comparison with DPG (Table XI) shows again the much lower fall in the viscosity as a result of using an organic solvent.<br>
Determination of the viscosity<br>
All of the viscosities reported in the present description, unless otherwise indicated, were determined as follows.<br>
The viscosity was measured in a rotational experiment at 25°C with a shear rate of 1 s"1 using an MCR301 rotational viscometer from Physica (Anton Paar, Ostfildern, Germany). Samples with a viscosity &gt; 100 mPa-s were measured using a cone/plate geometry (diameter = 50.0 mm, angle = 0.981°). Samples with a viscosity
