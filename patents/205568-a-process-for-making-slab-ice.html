COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br><br>
 PROCESSFOR MAkING SLAB ICE<br>
CHAINSUKH SHOBHACHAND GANDHI of 25, NAV RAJASTHAN HSG. SOCIETY, SENAPATI BAPAT ROAD, PUNE - 411 016, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, INDIAN National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
A PLANT FOR MAKING SLAB ICE<br>
The invention relates to a plant for making ice slab. More particularly the invention relates to plant for making hygenic ice slab.<br>
In the conventional system of ice making wherein the plant occupies too much of space that is about by 12 meters * 12 meters to make 15 tons per day of block ice. The environment in which the conventional plant reduces are water which gets contaminated with brine solution or dipping water cans in brine solution . In the conventional system there is too much of human handling such as dirt from the shoes of operator and the environmental pollution which makes the process unhygenic.<br>
Therefore there is need to develop a plant which requires less space and produces hygenic ice slab.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to produce hygenic ice-slab with minimum cost.<br>
The invention is based on "water" changes to " ice " i.e frozen water, when latent heat of freezing is removed from water i.e. 80 Kcal heat removal at 0°C water converts water to ice. Invention to make "slab" ice from water without using conventional brine tank and dipping water cans in brine tank to freeze water as slab ice.<br>
Conventional slab ice plant occupies too much space i.e. about 12 M * 12 M to make 15 tons per day ice where as new invention allows same production in 4 M * 12 M space.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
The coventional plant produces dirty ice as water gets contaminated with brine and dirt from water gets contaminated with brine and dirt from shoes of the operator . New invention uses technique which allows ice fully hygenic.<br>
The new invention is the stainless steel water channels of 30 to 100 mm width , 300 to 500 mm height and 1000 to 3000 lengths are made with one end closed and top open. Second end is closed with flat soft side head of the valve (closing the side with polyurethane / PVC / rubber covered flap , so that water does not leak out from freezing container channel.<br>
The water is then taken in to this channel . This has jacket liquid refrigerant evaporation arrangement where liquid refrigerant is evaporated to gas taking away latent heat of freezing from water and converts water to ice. This is acheived by connecting refrigerant side to standard refrigeration system.<br>
The drag chain is kept dipped in water gets embedded in slab of ice. Water for next cycles of freezing is taken in the channel , refrigerant is stopped by closing actuated refrigerant valve , hot gas valve is operated to push out liquid refrigerant to surge tank. The hot gas warms up walls of ice tank (channel) and releases the slab of ice because of this ice comes out of side opening.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
The tank side door is opened . Then the drag chain drive is then started . This brings ice slab out of ice forming channel . The valve flap is then again closed and water spilled out in tray is pumped in to water channel and refrigeration valve is opened for freezing the water and the cycle of ice slab making repeats.<br>
The slabs of ice are taken on roller to convey on to pallet . The "" star cool cozy " is used to cover the ice slabs to avoid melting loss in open air.<br>
The benefits of the invention over the conventional one is of space saving and obtaining hygenic ice.<br>
The inventor has made a compact plant for the manufacture of ice slabs by following components :<br><br>
slab ice maker  (1)<br>
phon  referigeration inner wall of ice -<br>
slab cooling conveyor<br>
The referigerant liquid inlet to surrounding which referigerant gas plus liquid outlet from ice maker (2) covered by referigeran : jacket of ice maker (3) is disposed with a thermos} arrangement (4) is disposed in the maker ; a freezing tank (5) is provided ; a referigerant accumulator (6) is provided outsice the ice maker to seperate a refrigerant gas and liqui 1 ; there is a gas outlet (7) to the compressor ; A ice (8) is provided to pull the ice - sltb from the ice maker to the pallet through chain and sprocket arrangement (9) the freezing tank end (10) a surge tajik (11) is provided<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
seperately having a gas trap valve (12) ; a hot gas<br>
solenoid valve (13) is provided in the accumulator region<br>
and main suction solenoid valve (14) and referigerant inlet<br>
valve (15) is disposed.	/<br>
Accordingly , there is provided a plant for making slab -ice in a hygenic way by completely avoiding human handling in a limited space for cost effective slab ice making comprising a ice making zone, a accumulator zone and a surge drum zone . The said ice - making zone comprising injecting refrigerant liquid into the ice maker having jacketed ice maker wherein thermosyphon , refrigeration arrangement are provided in the inner part of the ice - maker , having a freezing tank , where the partially cooled water through the accumulator will pass to the ice - maker and a ice - slab is produced due to the refrigerant which allows the water changing into ice , i.e. frozen water when latent heat of freezing is removed from water i.e. 80 Kcal. / Kg of water heat removal from and 0°Centigrate the water converts water to ice without the use of brine tank and the ice slab thus produced is conveyed by the conveyor belt run through chain and sprocket arrangement and delivered on to the pallet . The star cool cozy is used to cover the ice slab , thereby producing hygenic ice - slab with minimal cost . The invention will now be described with refernce to Figure. 1 , 2 , and 3 in the accompanying specification.<br>
Fig. 1 : is a plan view of the plant for making slab - ice.<br>
Fig. 2 : is a elevation of the plant for making slab - ice.<br>
Fig. 3 : is the end view of the plant for making slab - ice.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 3 , a compact plant for the manufacture of ice slabs is being produced by following components :<br>
The referigerant liquid inlet to slab ice maker (1) surrounding which referigerant gas plus liquid outlet from ice maker (2) covered by referigerant jacket of ice maker (3) is disposed with a thermosyphon referigeration arrangement (4) is disposed in the inner wall of ice -maker ; a freezing tank (5) is provided ; a referigerant accumulator (6) is provided outside the ice maker to seperate a refrigerant gas and liquid ; there is a gas outlet (7) to the compressor ; A ice - slab cooling conveyor (8) is provided to pull the ice - slab from the ice maker to the pallet through chain and sprocket arrangement (9) the freezing tank end (10) a surge tank (11) is provided seperately having a gas trap valve (12) ; a hot gas solenoid valve (13) is provided in the accumulated region and main suction solenoid valve (14) and referigerant inlet valve (15) is disposed .<br>
