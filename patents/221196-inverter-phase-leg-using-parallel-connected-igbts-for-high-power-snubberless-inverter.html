				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an inverter phase leg module using parallel connected IGBTs for high power snubberless inverters.<br>
An inverter is used to convert direct current (DC) power source to alternating current (AC) power source. Normally inverters use self-commutating devices, such as, gate-turn-off thyristors (GIOs), insulated gate-bipolar transistors (IGBTs), integrated gate—commutated thyristors (IGCTs) etc. The IGBT has become the most commonly used power semiconductor device for medium to high power inverters because of its voltage driven characteristics and the consequent simple gate drive circuit.<br>
Patent No. US 5/98916 discloses the assembly of high power inverter employing series connected devices with reduced stray loop inductance. The voltage rating of an inverter can be increased by connecting switching devices in series. Patent No. US 5422440 discloses low inductance bus arrangement for high power inverter. Low inductance is achieved by using electrically conducting bars having rounded edges and inserting dielectric materials between parallel conductors.<br>
Generally, snubber circuits, consisting of resistors, capacitors and diodes are connected across the 1BBT to protect it during turn-on and turn-off. There are several disadvantages associated with the use of snubber circuit across the IBBT.<br>
One of the main disadvantages of the snubber circuit is that it occupies spaces resulting in bulkier inverter.<br>
Another disadvantage with the snubber circuit is that the energy in the stray wiring inductance of the inverter circuit is dissipated as heat in the resistor of the snubber circuit. The heat loss in the snubber circuit decreases the inverter efficiency.<br>
Yet another disadvantage with voltage source type of I6BT based inverter is that a high value of capacitor bank has to be connected across DC link to maintain the DC link voltage ripple-free . A phase leg of inverter comprises of two switches in series across the DC link. If the two switches in a phase leg conduct simultaneously because of control circuit failure, the capacitors bank discharges through the IBBTs in the phase module, resulting in destruction of IBBTs due to shoot-through fault.<br><br>
Further disadvantages is that IGBTs of very high voltage and current ratings are not available. To realise high power IGBT inverter, IGBTs have to be connected in parallel. IGBTs of suitable characteristics have to be connected in parallel for equal current sharing. As mentioned earlier, the stray inductance in inverter circuit wiring causes additional loss, which has to be dissipated in the snubber circuit.<br>
As high power IGBTs are not available, it becomes necessary to connect a large number of IGBTs in parallel to form a phase leg for high power inverter. It is desirable to eliminate the snubber, so as to give compact and efficient inverter. But, at the same time, it requires careful consideration in the inverter assembly, so that the device can be protected during turn—on and turn-off without the use of snubber. Further, as the voltage source inverter is prone to failure due to shoot-through fault, it is desirable to incorporate protection device in each phase leg to protect the devices against shoot through fault.<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective means to protect the high power inverter during turn—on and turn-off of the device and eliminate the snubber circuit.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide the means for connecting iCJBIs in parallel in a phase leg such that the stray inductance in wiring is reduced to bare minimum.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device for the phase module of I6BT inverter, with which the heat generated by the IGBTs is effectively dissipated to keep the junction temperature of IBBTs within permissible limit.<br>
A further objective of the present is to provide the means for the high power I6BT inverter for mounting the filter capacitors? and discharge resistors in such a way so as to reduce the stray inductance and consequent elimination of snubber circuit for realizing compact inverter.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an ultra-fast acting current sensing and protection circuit to protect the 16Bfs in a phase module against over-current due to shoot-through fault or over-load.<br>
Still  a further objective of the present invention  is<br>
to  connect  three such 1SBT phase leg modules in  a  three-phase<br>
 bridge configuration for conversion of power from DC to AC ,Q.r AXX<br>
to DC<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an inverter phase leg module using parallel connected IGBT* for high power snubberless three phase inverter, said inverter phase leg module comprising an assembly of a heat sink having a blower mounted on top of said heat sink, plurality of IGBTs are mounted on said heat sink and said IGBTs having positive busbars connected to the collector terminals of top IGBT, and negative busbar connected to emitter terminals of the bottom IGBTs and the AC output phase busbar is formed by connecting the emitter terminals of the top IGBTs, a plurality of capacitors mounted between a pair of fiberglass sheets one at the bottom and the other at the top of the capacitor bank having DC input positive busbar and a negative busbar and discharge resistors connected between positive and negative busbars of paralled capacitors and the IGBT assembly and the capacitor assembly is connected by positive connecting busbar and negative busbar, said positive connecting busbar is provided with a current sensor connected to a fault detection and protection circuit.<br>
