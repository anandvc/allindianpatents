3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a procedure and equipment for the production of core thread or core dummy twisted thread. Herein at least one sliver is combined and twisted with at least one filament, wherein the sliver is subjected to a compression process prior to rotation.<br>
With the DE 198 15 054 C1 already this kind of procedure and spinning machine meant for its execution are known. After the exit roller pair, sufficiently known compression equipment is arranged with, for example, a suction element and a surrounding transport belt having at least partial air permeability and moving over this element and which has sliding surface provided with a suction slit. This causes compression of at least one sliver. A core thread filament is fed from a stock in such a manner that along with a sliver runs through the exit roller pair of the drafting equipment and the compression equipment. For producing a dummy twist from at least two slivers, the filament, however, is also combined with a sliver and compressed together. The subsequent imparting of twist follows either through a traditional ring spinning fixture or a pot spinning fixture.<br>
With the common compression of filament and sliver an especially good integration of the filament in the core thread or dummy twist can be achieved. In the practice, however, this effect is not reached, because through different tensioning drafts in the region of the compression equipment differences arise in lengths between filament and sliver. Thereby the core thread can loose its stretched position and loops can emerge in the reinforced fiber. In case of subsequent imparting of twist through a ring spindle, besides the core thread comes out of the fiber embedding due to centrifugal forces occurring in the thread balloon of thread.<br>
To tackle the problem of differential tensioning drafts, according to the DE 101 49 635 CI the filament should be directly fed in the compression zone and then must compressed together with the sliver. Since, however, in the selected technical solution this is fraught with considerable difficulties in introducing the filament, an additional suction zone for the filament is arranged upstream ahead of the compression zone, which is handled separately from flow technology point of view. This leads - in the practical implementation - especially due to spindle specific switching related influencing of separate air engineering measures to considerable expenditure. For certain filament qualities these special air engineering measures are not even sufficient.<br>
2<br><br>
Therefore, the basic task of the invention is to create a procedure and an equipment for the production of core thread or core dummy thread, which allow a high grade embedding of a filament without much technical effort.<br>
This task is resolved through the procedure according to the characteristic part of the patent claim 1. Other advantageous features are contained in claims 2 to 7. Equipment suitable for the execution of the procedure is contained in claim 8, which is formed in more details through the claims 9 to 18.<br>
A major advantage of the invention is that the filament is fed to the sliver(s) free of draft with defined tension after the compression zone. The feeding is done in most simple manner through a thread guide.<br>
The invention is described more in detail below on the basis of a design example. The related drawings show in<br>
Fig. 1	Side view of an invention based equipment with a drafting equipment, a<br>
compression unit and a ring spinning unit,<br>
Fig. 2	Plan view of parts of the drafting equipment and the compression unit<br>
and in<br>
Fig. 3	a Detail from Fig. 2.<br>
In the following design example the invention is shown on the basis of production of core dummy twisted thread, in which two slivers and one filament are combined as core thread and provided with a twist.<br>
Analogue to this, the invention, however, is applicable also for the production of core thread from one sliver and one filament or for other numeric combinations of slivers and filaments.<br>
Fig. 1 shows draft equipment 1, how it is used at ring spinning machines. On the shafts not represented in the figure three driven bottom rollers 2; 3; 4 are arranged, by which three top rollers 6; 7; 8 suspended in one pressure arm 5 are carried. The bottom roller 4 and the<br>
3<br><br>
top roller 8 form together the exit roller pair 4; 8 of the draft equipment 1. Up to this exit roller pair 4; 8 in the draft equipment 1 a sufficiently known stretching of fed sliver 9 takes place.<br>
At the exit roller pair 4; 8 joins a compression zone with a suction element 10, which is described more in detail later on. This suction element 10 and a guiding roller 11 are partially encircled each by one air permeable transport belt 12. In the sector covered by the transport belt 12 the guiding roller 11 is in touch with a drive roller 13, which is in contact with a motorized drive in a manner not shown here. Preferably this drive roller 13 is like the bottom rollers 2; 3; 4 part of a drive shaft across several spinning locations or the entire machine length. The pressure of the guiding roller 11 at the drive roller 13 is applied by means of a spring 14, which is fixed to a holding anglel5, which is in contact with the spinning machine frame. The transport belt 12 and the sliver 9 resting on it are held besides by a clamping roller 16 at the surface of the suction element 10.<br>
For the purpose of imparting the twist downstream to the draft equipment 1 with the compression unit 10-16 traditional ring spinning equipment 17 is arranged, elements of which need not described here more in detail.<br>
To the draft equipment 1 also allocated is a filament stock 18 (preferably a spool) with a filament 19, which serves as core thread for the core yarn or core dummy thread. This filament 19 can be, for example, a thread, a monofilament, an elasthan fiber, a metallized plastic filament or even metallic thread.<br>
In the plan view as per Fig. 2 two slivers 9 guided in the draft equipment 1 parallel to each other can be recognized. According to the invention first follows the compression of slivers 9 and thereafter the feed of filament 19 from the filament stock 18. In the represented variant the clamping roller 16 takes over the drawing of filament 19. Alternatively, it is also possible, to involve a positively driven delivery fixture.<br>
The combination of the filament 19 with the slivers 9 takes place in the described case of production of core dummy twisted thread after the clamping point built up by the clamping roller 16 and the transport belt 12 resting on the suction element 10. it means, the slivers 9 and the filament 19 run through the clamping point still at distance from each<br>
4<br><br>
other and form according to this a kind of 'Spinning triangle" till the twist generated by the ring spinning fixture 17 sets in.<br>
In case of production of core thread, for which for example, only one sliver 9 and one filament 19 can be referred to, its combining point can be located also directly in the clamping line between clamping roller 16 and transport belt 12.<br>
For the production of core dummy twisted thread as can be seen in Fig. 2 the invention based design of the suction element 10 continues to be of significance. For both the slivers 9 to be compressed, the suction element 9 contains one each of suction slit 21 running taper to the run direction 20 of the slivers 9. Both the suction slits 21 are so set that these run towards each other in the run direction 21 in V shape. On the inlet side the slivers 9 are thus guided as a sufficient distance, which prevents that threads jump between slivers 9. The slivers 9 approach each other only after takeover of threads by the compression equipment. Especially, in case of worsted yarn this can be supported additionally by the arrangement of a Siro front condenser 22 ahead of exit roller pair 4; 8 (see Fig. 1).<br>
This V shaped arrangement of the suction slit 21 is also responsible for the fact mentioned already that both the slivers 9 still move in the clamping line at the clamping roller 16 at distance from each other.<br>
Thus, there is a possibility, to feed also the filament 19 in such a manner that this clamping point passes still with distance to the slivers 9. It has proved itself as especially advantageous, if the filament 19 is fed on the center line between the slivers 9. This is ensured by a thread guide 23 arranged in the region of clamping roller 16. However, there is also a possibility of arranging this thread guide 23 - as adjustable - diagonal to the run direction 20 of the slivers 9, so that it also becomes possible, to guide the filament 19 with the same coverage or immediate next to one of the slivers 9 to the clamping point. Herein, however, a care should be taken that the thread guide 23 in run direction 20 is also arranged according to the suction slits 21, so that in the region of compression unit no contact between filament 19 and slivers 9 is possible.<br>
In the already mentioned case of production of core thread with only a single sliver 9 and a single filament 19 the allocated suction slit 21 is also arranged taper with respect to the<br>
5<br><br>
run direction 20 of the sliver 9.<br>
Major part of the invention belongs to the designing of the transport belt 12. Advantageously, it is made up of fabric or thread which receives tensile load. The fabric is coated differently on both sides. On the side facing the suction element 10 the coating has an easy-to-slide surface, whereas the coating of the other side is designed in the interest of good and loop-free transport of the sliver 9 with good grip. Along with the coatings the transport belt 12 achieves a thickness between 0.9 and 1.2 mm. The surrounding air permeating zone 24 of the transport belt 12 is - considering a sideways movement tolerance - just marginally broader than the effective width of the suction slit 21 in the direction of movement 20. In the zone 24 the transport belt 12 is provided with perforation, which consists - in actually known manner - advantageously of evenly arranged, circular shaped perforations 25. The degree of perforation of the zone 24, i. e. The area proportion of perforations 25 with respect to total area of zone 24 is between 15 and 30%.<br>
In the described case of production of core dummy twisted thread for both the suction slits 21 of the suction element 10 a common transport belt 12 is deployed, which has two air permeating zones 24 in the sense described above.<br>
