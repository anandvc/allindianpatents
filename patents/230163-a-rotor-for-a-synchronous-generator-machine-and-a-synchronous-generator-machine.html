				<td>HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPER-CONDUCTING COILS SUPPORTED BY AN IRON CORE ROTOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a super-conductive coil in a synchronous<br>
rotating machine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a rotor having a<br>
super-conductive core, coil support structures and an electromagnetic shell.<br>
Synchronous electrical machines having field coil windings include, but are not<br>
limited to, rotary generators, rotary motors, and linear motors. These machines<br>
generally comprise a stator and rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor<br>
may include a multi-pole rotor core and one or more coil windings mounted on the<br>
rotor core. The rotor cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material, such<br>
as an iron-core rotor.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings (although<br>
low by conventiona measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial heating of the<br>
rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine. Recently, super-<br>
conducting (SC) coil windings have been developed for rotors. SC windings have<br>
effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
Known super-conductive rotors employ air-core designs, with no iron in the rotor, to<br>
achieve air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher. These high air-gap magnetic<br>
fields yield increased power densities of the electrical machine, and result in<br>
significant reduction in weight and size of the machine. Air-core super-conductive<br>
rotors require large amounts of super-conducting wire. The large amounts of SC wire<br>
add to the number of coils required, the complexify of the coiJ supports, and the cost<br>
of the SC coil windings and rotor.<br><br>
High temperature SC coil field windings are formed of super-conducting materials<br>
that are brittle, and must be cooled to a temperature at or below a critical temperature,<br>
e.g., 27Â°K, to achieve and maintain super-condiictivity. The SC windings may he<br>
formed of a high temperature super-conducting material, such as a BSCCO<br>
(BixSrxCaxCuxOx) based conductor.<br>
Super-conducting coils have been cooled by liquid helium. After passing through the<br>
windings of the rotor, the hot, used helium is returned as room-temperature gaseous<br>
helium, using liquid helium for cryogenic cooling required continuous reliquefaction <br>
of the returned, room-temperature gaseous helium, and such reliquefaction poses<br>
significant reliability problems and requires significant auxiliary power.<br>
Prior SC coil cooling techniques include cooling an epoxy-impregnated SC coil<br>
through a sohd conduction path from a cryocooler. Alternatively, cooling tubes in the<br>
rotor may convey a liquid and/or gaseous cryogen to a porous SC coil winding that is<br>
immersed in the flow of the liquid and/or gaseous cryogen. However, immersion<br>
cooling requires the entire field winding and rotor structure to be at cryogenic<br>
temperature, as a result no iron can be used in the rotor magnetic circuit because of<br>
the brittle nature of iron at cryogenic temperatures.<br>
What is needed is a super-conducting field winding assemblage for an electrical<br>
machine that does sot have the disadvantages of the air-core and liquid-cooled super-<br>
conducting field winding assemblages of, for example, known super-conductive<br>
rotors.<br>
In addition, high temperature super-conducting (HTS) coils are sensitive to<br>
degradation from high bending and tensile strains. These coils must undergo<br>
substantial centrifugal forces that stress and strain the coil windings. Normal<br>
operation of electrical machines involves thousands of start up and shut down cycles<br>
over the course of several years that result in low cycle fatigue loading of the rotor.<br>
Furthermore, the HTS rotor winding should be capable of withstanding 25% over-<br>
Speed operation during rotor balancing procedures at ambient temperature and<br>
notwithstanding occasional over-speed conditions at cryogenic temperatures during<br><br>
power generation operation. These over-speed conditions substantially increase the<br>
centrifugal ibrce loading on the windings over normal operating conditions.<br>
High strains can damage HTS super-conductor wire. To withstand high strains, HTS<br>
wire have in the past been protected by massive and complex coil winding and coil<br>
support structures. However, massive, complex superrconducting windings and<br>
supports are costly, especially in state-of-the-art air core electrical machines.<br>
Moreover, these massive windings have to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures, and<br>
thus require large refrigeration systems.<br>
The coil windings also are isolated from the hot coil supports and rotor. To isolate the<br>
coil windings, large thermal insulators have been used to separate the coils from their<br>
support systems. Because the insulators are between the coils and their support<br>
systems, prior thermal insulators are large structures that can support the high<br>
centrifugal loading of coils. Because these large thermal insulators are in contact with<br>
the cold coils, me insulators are a large heat source to the coils. While the isolators<br>
are designed to minimize heat conduction to the coils, the insulators result in large<br>
cryogenic heat loads and expensive cryorefrigerators.<br>
Developing support systems for HTS coil has been a difficult challenge in adapting<br>
SC coils to HTS rotors. Examples of coil support systems for HTS Totors that have<br>
previously been proposed are disclosed in U. S. Patents Nos. 5,548,168; 5,532,663;<br>
5,672,921; 5,777,420; 6,169,353, and 6,066,906. However, these coil support<br>
systems suffer various problems, such as being expensive, complex and requiring an<br>
excessive number of components. There is a long-felt need-for a HTS rotor having a<br>
coil support system for a S.C. coil. The need also exists for a coil support system made<br>
with low cost and easy to fabricate components.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A high temperature super-conducting (HTS) rotor has been developed having a two-<br>
pole core-body formed of a solid magnetic material, such as iron. The rotor core body<br>
is generally cylindrical and has flat surfaces machined longidinally along its length.<br>
The HTS coil is assembled around these flat surfaces and the coil has a race-track<br><br>
shape that extends around the core. The race-track coil is supported by tension coil<br>
support members that extend through the won core rotor body. Drive and collector<br>
shafts are mechanically iastened to the rotor sore. A cylindrical shell eletromagnetic<br>
shield surrounds the HTS coil and iron core rotor body.<br>
The iron core rotor significantly reduces the field winding ampere-turns, super-<br>
conductor utilization and cost with respect to air-cooled rotors. The single race-track<br>
shaped HTS coil replaces typical complex saddle-shaped coil windings. The tension<br>
coil support provides direct support to the HTS coil so as to reduce the strains on the<br>
coil during cool-down and centrifugal loading. Moreover, the coil support system is<br>
at cryogemic temperatures with the coil.<br>
The HTS rotor may be implemented in a machine originally designed to include a SC<br>
coil(s). Alternatively, the HTS rotor may be implemented to replace a conventional<br>
rotor field winding of a two-pole synchronous machine with a single race-flack<br>
shaped high temperature super-conducting (HTS) coil. The rotor and its SC coil are<br>
described in the context of a generator, but the HTS coil rotor and coil support<br>
disclosed here are also suitable for use in other synchronous machines.<br>
In a first embodiment the invention is a rotor for a synchronous machine comprising:<br>
a cylindrical magnetic solid rotor core; a race-track super-conducting coil winding<br>
extending around the rotor core; a coil support extending through the core and<br>
attaching to opposite long sides of the coil winding, and a pair of end shafts extending<br>
axially from said core and attached to the core.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention is a method for assembling a high<br>
temperature super-conducting rotor having a coil -winding on a solid iron rotor core of<br>
a synchronous machine comprising the steps of extending a tension bar through a<br>
conduit in said rotor core, wherein said conduit extends between opposite planer<br>
sections on long sides of the core; inserting a housing over a portion of the coil;<br>
attaching an end of the tension bar to the housing, and attaching rotor end shafts to<br>
opposite ends of the rotor core.<br><br>
In a further embodiment the invention is a rotor in a synchronous machine<br>
comprising, a cylindrical rotor core having a pair of planer sections on opposite sides<br>
of the core and extending longitudinally along the core; a super-conducting coil<br>
winding extending around at least a portion of the rotor core, the coil winding having<br>
a pair of side sections adjacent the planer sections of the core; a first end shaft<br>
extending axially from a first end of the rotor core, and a second end shaft extending<br>
axialfy from a second end of the rotor core.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 10 having a stator 12<br>
and a rotor 14. The rotor includes field winding coils that fit inside the cylindrical<br>
rotor vacuum cavity 16 of the stator. The rotor fits inside the rotor vacuum cavity of<br>
the stator. As the rotor turns within the stator, a magnetic field 18 (illustrated by<br>
dotted lines) generated by the rotor and rotor coils moves/rotates through the stator<br>
and creates an electrical current in the windings of the stator coils 19. This current is<br>
output by the generator as electrical power.<br><br>
The rotor 14 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 20 and a generally solid<br>
rotor core 22. The solid core 22 has high magnetic permeability, and is usually made<br>
of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron, is a low power density super-conducting<br>
machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the magnetomotive force (MMF),<br>
and, thus, minimize the amount of super-conducting (SC) coil wire needed for the coil<br>
winding. For example, the solid iron-rotor core may he magnetically saturated at an<br>
air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla<br>
The rotor 14 supports at least one longitudinally-extending, race-track shaped, high-<br>
temperature super-conducting (HTS) coil winding 34 (See Fig. 2). A coil support<br>
system is disclosed here for a single race-track SC coil winding. The coil support<br>
system may be adapted for coil configurations other than a single race-track coil<br>
mounted on a solid rotor core, such as a multiple race-track coil configuration.<br>
The rotor core is supported by end shafts attached to the core. The rotor includes a<br>
collector end shaft 24 and a drive end shaft 30 that are supported by bearings 25. The<br>
end shafts may be coupled to external devices. The collector end shaft 24 includes<br>
collector rings 78 that provide an external electrical connection to the SC coil. The<br>
collector end shaft also has a cryogen transfer coupling 26 to a source of cryogenic<br>
cooling fluid used to cool the SC coil -windings in the rotor. The cryogen transfer<br>
coupling 26 includes a stationary segment coupled to a source of cryogen cooling<br>
fluid and a rotating segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS coil. The drive<br>
end shaft 30 of the rotor may be driven by a power turbine via power coupling 32.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary HTS race-track field coil winding 34. The SC field<br>
winding coils 34 of the Totor includes a high temperature super-conducting (SC) coil<br>
36. Each SC coli includes a high temperature super-conducting conductor, such as a<br>
BSCCO (BixSrxCaxCuxOx) conductor wires laminated in a solid epoxy impregnated<br>
winding composite. For example, a series of BSCCO 2223 wires may be laminated,<br>
bonded together and wound into as solid epoxy impregnated coil.<br>
SC wire is brittle and easy to be damaged. The SC coil is typically layer wound SC<br>
tape that is epoxy impregnated. The SC tape is -wrapped in a precision coil form to<br><br>
attain close dimensional tolerances. The tape is wound around in a helix to form the<br>
race-track SC coil 36.<br>
The dimensions of the race-track coil are dependent on the dimensions of the rotor<br>
core. Generally, each race-track SC coil encircles the magnetic poles at opposite ends<br>
of the rotor core, and is parallel to the rotor axis. The coil windings are continuous<br>
around the race-track. The SC coils form a resistance free electrical current path<br>
around the rotor core and between the magnetic poles of the core. The coil has<br>
electrical contacts 114 that electrically connect the coil to the collector 78.<br>
Fluid passages 38 for cryogenic cooling fluid are included in the coil winding 34.<br>
These passages may extend around an outside edge of ihe SC coil 36. The<br>
passageways provide cryogenic cooling fluid to the coil and remove heat from the<br>
coil. The cooling fluid maintains the low temperatures, e.g., 27Â°K, in the SC coil<br>
winding needed to promote super-conducting conditions, including the absence of<br>
electrical resistance in the coil. The cooling passages have an input and output fluid<br>
ports 112 at one end of the rotor core. These fluid (gas) ports ] 12 connect the cooling<br>
passages 38 on the SC coil to the cryogen transfer coupling 26.<br>
Each HTS race-track coil winding 34 has a pair of generally straight side portions 40<br>
parallel to a rotor axis 20, and a pair of end portions 54 that are perpendicular to the<br>
rotor axis. Tbe side portions of the coil are subjected to the greatest centrifugal<br>
stresses. Accordingly, the side portions are supported by a coil support system that<br>
counteract the centrifugal forces that act on the coil.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an exploded view of a rotor core 22 and coil support system for a<br>
high temperature super-conducting coil. The support system includes tension rods 42<br>
connected to U-shapgd coil housings at opposite ends of each rod. The coil housings<br>
hold and support the side portions 40 of the coil winding 38 in the rotor. While one<br>
tension rod and coil housing is shown in FIGURE 3, the coil support system will<br>
generally include a series of lension rods with housings at ihe ends of each rod.<br>
FIGURE 3 show for illustratative purpose only an end 86 of the tension rod extending<br>
beyond the side 40 of the coil, but in practice the end 86 would abut an inside surface<br><br>
of the coil. The tension rods and coil housings prevent damage to the coil winding<br>
during rotor operation, support the coil winding with respect to centrifugal and other<br>
forces, and provide a protective shield for the coil winding.<br>
The principal loading of the HTS coil winding 34 in an iron core rotor is from<br>
centrifugal acceleration during rotor rotation. An effective coil structural support is<br>
needed to counteract the centrifugal forces. The coil support is needed especially<br>
along the side sections 40 of the coil that experience the most centrifugal acceleration.<br>
To support the side sections of the coil, the tension rods 42 span between the sections<br>
of the coil and attach to the coil housings 44 that grasp opposite side sections of the<br>
coil. The tension rods extend through conduits 46, e.g., apertures, in the rotor core so<br>
that the rods may span between side sections of the same coil or between adjacent<br>
coils.<br>
The conduits 46 are generally cylindrical passages in the rotor core having a straight<br>
axis. The diameter of the conduits is substantially constant, except at their ends near<br>
the recessed surfaces of the rotor. At their ends, the conduits may expand to a larger<br>
diameter to accommodate a non-conducting cylindrical insulator tube 52 that provides<br>
a slidable bearing surface and thermal isolation between the rotor core and the tension<br>
rod.<br>
The axes of the conduits 46 are generally in a plane defined by the race-track coil. In<br>
addition, the axes of the conduits are perpendicular to the side sections of the coil to<br>
which are connected the tension rods that extends through the conduits. Moreover,<br>
the conduits are orthogonal to and intersect the rotor axis, in the embodiment shown<br>
here. The number of conduits and the location of the conduits will depend on the<br>
location of the HTS coils and the number of coil housings needed to support the side<br>
sections of the coils.<br>
The tension rods support the coil especially well with respect to centrifugal forces as<br>
the rods extend substantially radially between the sides of the coil winding. Each<br>
tension rod is a shaft with continuity along the longitudinal direction of the rod and in<br>
the plane of the race-track coil. The longitudinal continuity of the tension rods<br><br>
provides lateral stiffness to the coils which provides rotor dynamics benefits.<br>
Moreover, the lateral stiffness permits integrating the coil support with the coils so<br>
that the coil can be assembled with the coil support prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-<br>
assembly of the coil and coil support reduces production cycle, improves coil support<br>
quality, and reduces coil assembly variations. The race-track coil is supported by an<br>
array of tension members that span the long sides of the coil. The tension rod coil<br>
support members are pre-assembled to coil.<br>
The HTS coil winding and structural support components are at cryogenic<br>
temperature. In contrast, the rotor core is at ambient "hot" temperature. The coil<br>
supports are potential sources of thermal conduction that would allow heat to reach<br>
the HTS coils from the rotor core. The rotor becomes hot during operation. As the<br>
coils are to be held in super-cooled conditions, heat conduction into the coils is to be<br>
avoided. The rods extend through apertures, e.g., conduits, in the rotor but are not in<br>
contact with the rotor. This lack of contact avoids the conduction of heat from the<br>
rotor to the tension rods and coils.<br>
To reduce the heat leaking away from the coil, the coil support is minimized to reduce<br>
the thermal conduction through support from heat sources such as the rotor core.<br>
There are generally two categories of support for super-conducting winding: (i)<br>
"warm" supports and (ii) "cold" supports. In a warm support, the supporting<br>
structures are thermally isolated from the cooled SC windings. With warm supports,<br>
most of the mechanical load of a super-conducting (SC) coil is supported by structural<br>
members spanning from cold to warm members.<br>
In a cold support system, the support system is at or near the cold cryogenic<br>
temperature of the SC coils. In cold supports, most of the mechanical load of a SC<br>
coil is supported by structural members which are at or near a cryogenic temperature.<br>
The exemplary coil support system disclosed here is a cold support in that the tension<br>
rods and associated housings that couple the tension rods to the SC coil windings are<br>
maintained at or near a cryogenic temperature. Because the supporting members are<br>
cold, these members are thermally isolated, e.g., by the non-contact conduits through<br>
the rotor core, from other "hot" components of the rotor.<br><br>
An individual support member consists of a tension rod 42 (which may be a bar and a<br>
pair of bolts at either end of the bar), a pair of coil housings 44, and a dowel pin 80<br>
that connects each housing to an end of the tension rod. Each coil housing 44 is a U-<br>
shaped bracket having legs that connect to a tension rod and a channel to receive the<br>
coil winding 34. The U-shaped housing allows for the precise and convenient<br>
assembly of the support system for the coil. A series of coil housings may be<br>
positioned end-to-end along the side of the coil winding. The coil housings<br>
collectively distribute the forces that act on the coil, e.g., centrifugal forces, over<br>
substantially the entire side sections 40 of each coil.<br>
The coil housings 44 prevent the side sections 40 of the coils from excessive flexing<br>
and bending due to centrifugal forces. The coil supports do not restrict the coils from<br>
longitudinal thermal expansion and contraction that occur during normal start/stop<br>
operation of the gas turbine. In particular, thermal expansion is primarily directed<br>
along the length of the side sections. Thus, the side sections of the coil slide slightly<br>
longitudinally with respect to the channel housing and tension rods.<br>
The U-shaped housings are formed of a light, high strength material that is ductile at<br>
cryogenic temperatures. Typical materials for coil housings are aluminum, Inconel,<br>
or titanium alloys, which are non-magnetic. The shape of the U-shaped housing may<br>
be optimized for low weight and strength.<br>
The dowel pin 80 extends through apertures in the coil housing and tension rod. The<br>
dowel may be hollow for low weight. Locking nuts (not shown) are threaded or<br>
attached at the ends of the dowel pin to secure the housing and prevent the sides of the<br>
housing from spreading apart under load. The dowel pin can be made of high strength<br>
Inconel or titanium alloys. The tension rods are made with larger diameter ends that<br>
are machined with two flat surfaces 86 at their ends.<br>
The width of these flat surfaces fit the U-shaped housing and coil width. The flat<br>
ends 86 of the tension rods abut an inside surface of the HTS coils 34, when the rod,<br>
coil and housing are assembled together. This assembly reduces the stress<br>
concentration at the hole in the tension rod that receives the dowel.<br><br>
The coil support system of tension rods 42 and coil housings 44 for the long sides 40<br>
of the coil, and a pair of split-clamps 58 for the coil ends may be assembled with the<br>
HTS coil windings 34 as both are mounted on the rotor core 22. The tension rods,<br>
channel housings and clamp provide a fairly rigid structure for supporting the coil<br>
windings and holding the coil windings in place with respect to the rotor core.<br>
Each tension rod 42 extends through the rotor core, and may extend orthogonally<br>
through the axis 20 of the rotor. Conduits 46 through the rotor core provide a passage<br>
through which extend the tension rods. The conduits 46 extend perpendicularly<br>
through the rotor axis and are symmetrically arranged along the length of the core.<br>
The number of conduits 46 and tension rods 42, and their arrangement on the rotor<br>
core and with respect to each other is a matter of design choice. The diameter of the<br>
conduits is sufficiently large to avoid having the hot rotor walls of the conduits be in<br>
contact with the cold tension rods. The avoidance of contact improves the thermal<br>
isolation between the tension rods and the rotor core.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 5 and 6, the rotor 14 comprises three main structural<br>
components, a stainless steel drive shaft 30, an iron rotor core 22, and a non-magnetic<br>
stainless steel collector shaft 24. The rotor core and end shafts are typically discrete<br>
components that are assembled and securely joined together by either bolting or<br>
welding. The drive and collector shafts are rabbeted and bolted to the iron rotor core.<br>
The iron rotor core is a cylindrical forging with fiats 48 machined across the<br>
quadrature axis of the core to accept a race-track coil 34 that is wound with high<br>
temperature super-conductor tape 36.<br>
A highly-conductive, cylindrical shell 90, made of copper or aluminum alloys fits<br>
over the rotor core. The shell 90 serves as an electromagnetic shield for the rotor<br>
winding and may form a vacuum envelope to a vacuum space that surrounds the low<br>
temperature rotor coil winding 34. The ends of the electromagnetic shield are bonded<br>
to stainless steel transition rings 130 as part of the shield 90 fabrication. The shield<br>
subassembly is welded to the drive and collector shafts to make a vacuum tight<br>
assembly around the coil windings.<br><br>
To receive the coil winding, the rotor core has recessed surfaces 48, such as flat or<br>
triangular regions or slots. These surfaces 48 are formed in the curved surface of the<br>
cylindrical core and extending longitudinally across the rotor core. The coil winding<br>
34 is mounted on the rotor adjacent the recessed areas 48. The coils generally extend<br>
longitudinally along an outer surface of the recessed area and around the ends of the<br>
rotor core. The recessed surfaces 48 of the rotor core receive the coil winding. The<br>
shape of the recessed area conforms to the coil winding. For example, if the coil<br>
winding has a saddle-shape or some other shape, the recess(es) in the rotor core would<br>
be configured to receive the shape of the winding.<br>
The recessed surfaces 48 receive the coil winding such that the outer surface of the<br>
coil winding extend to substantially an envelope defined by the rotation of the rotor.<br>
The outer curved surfaces 50 of the rotor core when rotated define a cylindrical<br>
envelope. This rotation envelope of the rotor has substantially the same diameter as<br>
the rotor cavity 16 (see Fig. 1) in the stator.<br>
The gap between the rotor envelope and stator cavity 16 is a relatively-small<br>
clearance, as required for forced flow ventilation cooling of the stator only, since the<br>
rotor requires no ventilation cooling. It is desirable to minimize the clearance<br>
between the rotorand stator so as to increase the electromagnetic coupling between<br>
the rotor coil windings and the stator windings. Moreover, the rotor coil winding is<br>
preferably positioned such that it extends to the envelope formed by the rotor and,<br>
thus, is separated from the stator by only the clearance gap between the rotor and<br>
stator.<br>
The end sections 54 of the coil winding 34 are adjacent opposite ends 56 of the rotor<br>
core. A split-clamp 58 holds each of the end sections of the coil windings in the rotor.<br>
The split clamp at each coil end 54 includes a pair of opposite plates 60 between<br>
which is sandwiched the coil winding 34. The surface of the clamp plates includes<br>
channels to receive the coil winding and connections 112,114 to the winding.<br>
The split clamp 58 may be formed of a non-magnetic material, such as aluminum or<br>
Inconel alloys. The same or similar non-magnetic materials may be used to form the<br><br>
tension rods, channel housings and other portions of the coil support system. The coil<br>
support system is preferably non-magnetic so as to preserve ductility at cryogenic<br>
temperatures, since ferromagnetic materials become brittle at temperatures below the<br>
Curie transition temperature and cannot be used as load-carrying structures.<br>
The split clamp 58 is surrounded by, but is not in contact with collar 62. The end<br>
shafts 24, 30 include a collar 62 that connects to an end of the rotor core 22. The<br>
collar is a thick disk of non-magnetic material, such as stainless steel, the same as or<br>
similar to the material that forms the rotor end shafts. The collar has a slot 64<br>
orthogonal to the rotor axis and sufficiently wide to receive and clear the split clamp<br>
58. The hot side-walls 66 of the slot collar are spaced apart from the cold split clamp<br>
so they do not come in contact with each other.<br>
The collar 62 may include a recessed disk area 68 (which is bisected by the slot 64) to<br>
receive a raised disk region 70 of the rotor core (see opposite side of rotor core for<br>
raised disk region to be inserted in opposite collar). The insertion of the raised disk<br>
region on the end 56 of the rotor core into the recessed disk 68 provides support to the<br>
rotor core in the collar, and assists in aligning the rotor core and collars. In addition,<br>
the collar may have a circular array of bolt holes 72 extending longitudinally through<br>
the collar and around the rim of the collar. These bolt holes correspond to matching<br>
threaded bolt holes 74 that extend partially through the rotor core. Threaded bolts 75<br>
(see Fig. 5) extend through these longitudinal bolt holes 72, 74 and secure the collars<br>
to the rotor core.<br>
The rotor core may be encased in a metallic cylindrical shield 90 that protects the<br>
super-conducting coil winding 34 from eddy currents and other electrical currents that<br>
surround the rotor and provides the vacuum envelope as required to maintain hard<br>
vacuum around the cryogenic components of the rotor. The cylindrical shield 90 may<br>
be formed of a highly conductive material, such as a copper alloy or aluminum. The<br>
SC coil winding 34 is maintained in a vacuum. The vacuum may be formed by the<br>
shield 90 which may include a stainless steel cylindrical layer that forms a vacuum<br>
vessel around the coil and rotor core.<br><br>
FIGURE 6, 7 and 8 show cross-sectional close-up diagrams of the collector end shaft<br>
24. In particular, these figures show a conduit tube 76 through the shaft which<br>
provides a passageway for the cooling fluid tubes and electrical lines. FIGURES 7<br>
and 8 show the conduit 76 of the collector end shaft, and associated shaft structures<br>
near the rotor core. The cross section shown in FIGURE 7 is orthogonal to the cross<br>
section shown in FIGURE 8. FIGURE 6 shows a cross section of the end of the<br>
collector shaft 24 near the cooling coupling 26.<br>
The electrical connections 114 from the coil winding 34 are connected to electrical<br>
lines 132. These lines extend the length of the end shaft 24 towards the collector<br>
rings 78. The electrical lines 132 extend through the conduit 76. The cold end<br>
segments of lines 132 are supported inside the thermal standoff insulator tube 140.<br>
An electrical contact 134 connects the electrical line 132 from inside the end shaft to a<br>
lead 136 that extends outside the shaft to the collector coupling rings 138.<br>
The cooling fluid inlet and outlet ports 112 from the coil connect to the inlet and<br>
outlet cooling tubes 94 that extend the length of the end shaft. These tubes are<br>
coaxial. The inlet tube 142 is at the center of the outlet tube 150. The inlet tube 142<br>
extends to an inlet port 144 of the coil coupling 112 that is coaxial with the rotor axis.<br>
The cooling gas outlet port 146 of the coil coupling 112 is offset from the rotor<br>
access. The outlet port couples to a gas transfer housing 148 which directs cooling<br>
fluid from the coil to an annular outlet tube 150. The outlet tube 150 is coaxial with<br>
the inlet tube 142 and external to the inlet tube.<br>
