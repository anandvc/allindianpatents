TKCHNTCAT. FTELD<br>
The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence device (hereinafter, electroluminescence will be referred to as EL) emitting while light and, more particularly, to an organic EL device having a high efficiency and a long life and emitting white light.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Electroluminescence devices which utilize electroluminescence show high self-distinguishability because of the self-emission and are excellent in impact resistance because they are completely solid devices. Therefore, electroluminescence devices have been attracting attention for application as light emitting devices in various types of display apparatus.<br>
The electroluminescence devices include inorganic electroluminescence devices in which an inorganic compound is used as the light emitting material and organic electroluminescence devices in which an organic compound is used as the light emitting material. Organic electroluminescence devices have been extensively studied for practical application as a light emitting device of the next generation because the applied voltage can be decreased to a large extent, the size of the device can be reduced easily, consumption of electric power is small, planar light emission is possible and three primary colors are easily emitted.<br><br>
As for the construction of the organic electroluminescence device, the basic construction comprises an anode / an organic light emitting layer / a cathode. Constructions having a hole injecting and transporting layer or an electron injecting layer suitably added to the basic construction are known. Examples of such construction include the construction of an anode / a hole injecting and transporting layer / an organic light emitting layer / a cathode and the construction of an anode / a hole injecting and transporting layer / an organic light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer/a cathode.<br>
Recently, organic EL devices for display apparatuses have been developed actively. In particular, a device which can emit white light is the major target of the development. An organic EL device emitting white light can be used as the light source for single color displays and back light. Moreover, an organic EL device emitting white light can be used for full color display when color filters are attached to a display apparatus.<br>
For examples, an organic EL device emitting white light is disclosed in the United States Patent No. 5,503,910, in which a laminate of a light emitting layer emitting blue light and a light emitting layer emitting green light is used as the layer of a light emitting medium and a fluorescent compound emitting red light is added to the layer of a light emitting medium. An organic EL device emitting white light is disclosed in the United States Patent No. 5,683,828, which has a layer of a light emitting medium obtained by adding a complex compound containing boron which is a fluorescent compound emitting red light to a light emitting layer emitting bluish green light.   An organic EL device emitting white light is<br><br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 10(1998)-308278, which has a light emitting medium obtained by adding a benzothioxanthene derivative which is a fluorescent compound emitting red light to a light emitting layer emitting bluish green light.<br>
However, the device disclosed in the United States Patent No. 5,503,910 has an efficiency of light emission as low as about 1 lumenAV and a life as short as about 1,000 hours although white light is emitted. The device disclosed in the United States Patent No. 5,683,828 has an efficiency of light emission as low as about 2.6 cd/A although white light is emitted. The device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 10(1998)-308278 has an efficiency of light emission as low as about 1 lumen/W although white light is emitted. No devices sufficiently satisfy the requirements for practical application with respect to the efficiency of light emission and the life.<br>
DTSCTiOSURE OF THE TNVENTTON<br>
The present invention has an object of providing an organic EL device emitting white light which emits white hght and exhibits properties sufficient for practical applications, i. e., a high efficiency of light emission of 5 lumenAV or greater and 5 cd/A or greater and a long life of 10,000 hours or longer.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above object, it was found that, when the layer of a light emitting medium comprises a light emitting material emitting blue light and a fluorescent compound having at least one structure selected from the fluoranthene skeleton structure, the pentacene structure and the perylene<br><br>
structure, an organic EL device comprising this layer of a light emitting medium disposed between a pair of electrodes has a high efficiency of light emission and a long life and emits white light. The present invention has been completed based on this knowledge.<br>
The present invention provides an organic electroluminescence device emitting white light which comprises a pair of electrodes and a layer of a light emitting medium disposed between the pair of electrodes, wherein the layer of a light emitting medium comprises a light emitting material emitting blue light and a fluorescent compound having at least one structure selected from a fluoranthene skeleton structure, a pentacene skeleton structure and a perylene skeleton structure.<br>

light emitting medium disposed between the pair of electrodes.<br>
The layer of a Hght emitting medium comprises a light emitting material emitting blue light and a fluorescent compound having at least one structure selected from the fluoranthene skeleton structure, the pentacene skeleton structure and the perylene skeleton structure.<br>
The layer of a light emitting medium comprises organic compounds as the main components thereof and is a medium providing a field for transportation and recombination of electrons and holes which are injected from the electrodes. This layer may comprise a single layer or a plurality of layers. When the layer of a light emitting medium comprises a plurality of layers, the layers comprised in the layer of a light emitting medium include a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting layer.<br>
In the present invention, various constructions of the layers can be used.<br>

The layer of a light emitting medium may comprise a light emitting layer emitting blue light and light emitting layer A described above.<br>
In this construction, the layer of a light emitting medium may comprise light emitting layer A and organic layers other than light emitting layer A. For example, as shown in Figure 2, light emitting layer A may be laminated with a charge transporting layer such as a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer and an electron transporting<br><br>
layer. The charge transporting layer and light emitting layer A may be laminated in the order reverse to that shown in Figure 2. Layers other than the charge transporting layers such as an electron barrier layer, a hole barrier layer, an organic semiconductive layer, an inorganic semiconductive layer and a layer for improvement of adhesion may also be contained in the laminate.<br>
It is preferable that light emitting layer A described above comprises the light emitting material emitting blue Hght and a fluorescent dopant emitting blue light and/or that the light emitting layer emitting blue light comprises the light emitting material emitting blue light and a fluorescent dopant emitting blue light.<br>

A glass substrate of 25 mm X 75 mm X1.1 mm thickness having a transparent electrode line of ITO (In-Sn-0) (manufactured by GEOMATEC Company) was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes under application of ultrasonic wave and treated by the UV ozone cleaning for 30 minutes. The cleaned glass substrate having a transparent electrode line was attached to a substrate holder in a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus. On the face of the substrate on which the transparent electrode line was disposed, a film of N,N'-bis(N,N'-diphenyl-<br><br>
4-aminphenyl)-N,N-diphenyl-4,4'-diamino-l,l'-biphenyl (a TPD232 film) having a thickness of 60 nm was formed in a manner such that the film covered the transparent electrode line. The TPD232 film worked as the hole injecting layer. Then, a film of 4,4'-bis[N-(l-naphthyl)-N-phenylaminojbiphenyl (an NPD film) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed on the TPD232 film. The NPD film worked as the hole transporting layer. On the NPD film, a styryl derivative DPVBi having the structure shown below and a fluorescent compound El having the structure also shown below (the peak wavelength of fluorescence: 565 nm) were vapor deposited in amounts such that the ratio of the amounts by weight was 40:0.04 and a film having a thickness of 40 nm was formed. This film worked as the light emitting layer emitting white light. On the film formed above, a film of tris(8-quinolinol)aluminum (an Alq film) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed.

Subsequently, Li (lithium, manufactured by SAES GETTERS Company) and Alq were binary vapor deposited and an Alq:Li film was formed as the electron injecting layer (a cathode). On the formed Alq:Li film, aluminum metal was vapor deposited and a metal cathode was formed.    Thus, an organic EL device was formed.<br>
The properties of the obtained organic EL device were evaluated. A direct voltage of 5 V was applied in a condition such that the ITO anode was connected to the positive electrode (+) and the aluminum cathode was connected to the negative electrode (-). White light was emitted at a luminance of 181 cd/m^, a maximum luminance of 110,000 cd/m^ and an efficiency of light emission of 8.8 cd/A. The chromaticity coordinates were (0.36, 0.32) and emission of white light could be confirmed.    The life was<br><br>
