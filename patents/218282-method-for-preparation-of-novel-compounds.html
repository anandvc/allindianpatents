Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Acyclic nucleotide analogues containing phosphonate groups are disclosed for example in U.S. Patents 4,659,825,4,8j)8^7J^,J,724,233, 5442/)51, 5,302,585, 5,208,221,5,352,786,5,356,886l  in EP" publication numbers 269,947,481,214,630,381, 369,409,454,427,468,119,434,450, 618,214 and 398,231 and in WO 95/07920, WO 94/03467 and WO 96/33200. The teachings of these patents include compounds in which a phosphonate group is linked to a defined purine or pyrimidine base, generally at the 1- or 9-position of the pyrimidine or purine bases, respectively, by way of a 2-(methoxy)propyl group, a 2-(methoxy)ethyl group, a 2-methoxy-3-hydroxypropyl group, or a 2-methoxy-3-fluoropropyl group, known respectively as PMP, PME, HPMP and FPMP purine or pyrimidine compounds. These compounds exhibit antiviral and cytostatic activity.<br>
Daluge et al. (34th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Oct. 4-7,1994) discloses carbovir derivatives in which the 6 position of the purine is substituted with cyclopropylamino, N-cyclopropyl-N-methylamino or N-aziridinyl.<br>
Cihlar et al, "Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy" 39(1):117-124 (1995) disclose N6-aminohexyl-PMEDAP.<br>
Holy et al., "ACS Symp. Ser." 401:57-71 (1989) and Holy, "Kern. Ind." 38(10):457-462 (1989) describe the antiviral activity of certain N6-substituted nucleotide analogues.<br>
Additional phosphonate-substituted pyrimidine analogues are disclosed by Holy et al., "Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun." 64:242-256 (1999), Eger et al., "J. Med. Chem." 37:3057-3061 (1994), Wormstadt et al., "J. Heterocyclic Chem." 37:1187-1191 (2000), and Franchetti et al., "Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides" 14(3-5):607-610 (1995). The latter three publications have a phosphonate-containing side-chain linked via a 6-N substituent of 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, and unless modified by the immediate context, alkyl means branched, normal or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons and includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, isopropyl, n-, sec-, iso- and tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 1-ethylpropyl, neopentyl, and t-pentyl.<br>
Halo typically means chloro, but includes bromo, fluoro, or iodo.<br>
Rl typically is H or amino, but also can be methylsulfanyl (i.e. methylthio).<br>
R2 generally is hydroxy or -N(R5)2 where R5 independently is H or C1-C5 alkyl.<br>
R3 typically is H or methyl, but may be hydroxymethyl (typically (S) configuration substantially free of the (R) enantiomer) or halomethyl, and, if methyl or halomethyl, preferably is in the (2R) configuration substantially free of the (2S) configuration. Halomethyl generally is fluoromethyl.<br>
R5 generally is H, but also can be lower (C1-C3) alkyl (one or both instances).<br>
As is further described infra, Z is suitably any ester or amide heretofore known for use with nucleotide phosphonates. When Z is an ester, it has the structure OR7. R7 ordinarily is H (i.e., Z is hydroxy) in compounds having antiviral activity per se, although other R7 ester groups described below are suitable for use as protecting groups or as pro-functionalities for prodrug embodiments.<br>
X preferably is O.<br>
Z is an ester or amide when it is desired to protect the compounds of this invention against undesired reactions or when the object is to provide an in vivo prodrug of the compound. Otherwise, Z is OH.<br>
The esters or amides are useful as protected intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of this invention where Z = OH. In this embodiment, the selection of ester or amide may not be important, depending upon the nature of the reaction involved. All that is needed is that the Z substituent not be removed until the step in Synthesis at which this is desired, and if this is not apparent on theoretical grounds it can be readily determined by rudimentary experiments. For example, esters in particular are used to protect the phosphonate hydroxy groups against alkylation.<br>
When Z serves as a prodrug functionality, the ester or amide is removed in vivo from the phosphonate. Suitable prodrug esters or amidates optionally are selected based on the substrate specificity of esterases and/or carboxypeptidases expected to be found within cells where precursor hydrolysis is desired. To the extent that the specificity of these enzymes is unknown, one will screen a plurality of nucleotide analogues of this invention until the desired substrate specificity is found. This will be apparent from the appearance of free phosphonate or antiviral activity. One generally selects compounds that are (i) not hydrolyzed or hydrolyzed comparatively slowly in the upper gut, (ii) gut and cell permeable and (iii) are hydrolyzed in the cell cytoplasm and/or systemic circulation. Screens with cells from particular tissues are used to identify precursors that are released in organs susceptible to a target viral or microbial infection, e.g. in the case of liver, precursor drugs capable of hydrolysis in the liver. Other infections, e.g. CMV or HIV, optionally are treated with a precursor that is hydrolyzed at substantially the same rate and to substantially the same degree in all tissues. Assays known in the art are suitable for these purposes, including intestinal lumen stability, cell permeation, liver homogenate stability and plasma stability assays. These assays are used to determine the bioavailability characteristics of the precursors.<br>
Typical examples of ester and amide substituents group Z are found in W095/07920, W098/04569 and EP 481214 Al. :Any ester or amide genus or species described inlhese publications (and in the preference order set forth in such publications) can be used as group Z herein.<br>
Usually, both Z are hydroxyl or both are ester and/or amide, i.e, typically 2 or no Z groups are hydroxy. In general, when neither Z is OH then one Z is amide and one is ester. Amides with naturally occurring amino acids and a esters with<br>
phenyl are preferred. The free carboxyl(s) of amino acid Z groups generally are ester if ied with C1-C5 alkyl.<br>
In general, Z is hydroxy in compounds to be used directly for antiviral purposes, i.e. such compounds are employed without any requirement for hydrolysis in vivo of the ester or amide.<br>
Protecting groups for hydroxyl include acetals, ketals or C1-C5 alkyl. A typical protecting group for amino is trityl. Other conventional protecting groups are known (Greene et al., "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed. 1991, pp. 1O-142 and 309-405).<br>
Utilities<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of viruses, or as intermediates in the preparation of such compounds. Exemplary viral infections to be treated or to be tested for susceptibility to compounds of this invention include infections caused by DNA or RNA viruses such as herpesviruses (CMV, HSV1, HSV 2, EBV, varicella zoster virus [VZV], bovid herpesvirus type 1, equid herpesvirus type 1, HHV-6, papillomaviruses (HPV types 1-55 including carcinogenic HPV), flavi viruses (including yellow fever virus, African swine fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus), togaviruses (including Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus), influenza viruses (types A-C), retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, SIV, FeLV, FIV, MoMSV), adenoviruses (types 1-8), poxviruses (vaccinia virus), enteroviruses (poliovirus types 1-3, Coxsackie, hepatitis A virus, and ECHO virus), gastroenteritis viruses (Norwalk viruses, rotaviruses), hantaviruses (Hantaan virus), polyomavirus, papovaviruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, rabies virus, respiratory synctial virus (RSV), hepatitis viruses A, B, C and E, and the like.<br>
Preferred compounds of this invention for the treatment of herpes viruses, hepadna viruses and HIV are those in which Ri = NH2, R2 = NH2 or OH, X = O and R3 = H or methyl. Other antiviral activities of compounds of this invention are determined by routine assay of antiviral activity using enzyme inhibition assays, tissue culture assays, animal model assays and the like as will be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
The novel compounds of this invention also are useful per se or as intermediates in the preparation of polymers having a wide variety of diagnostic, therapeutic and industrial utilities.<br>
The compounds of this invention are suitable as intermediates to prepare affinity absorption media bearing substituent groups having properties useful for absorbing compounds from impure mixtures. These are prepared and used in the<br>
same fashion as other ion exchange media containing the same substituents, e.g. phosphonate or amino. For example, the phosphonate group of the compounds herein are covalently bound to insoluble matrix and free Ri amino substituents on the heterocyclic base serve as ion exchange sites. Alternatively, the heterocyclic base amino group is linked to the matrix and the free phosphonate group is then useful in the chromatographic absorption of positively charged molecules. Other immobilized embodiments of the compounds herein are useful in purifying proteins, e.g., enzymes to which the compounds of this invention may bind, e.g. transport proteins (see Cihlar, supra).<br>
Suitable methods of incorporation of the compounds of this invention into insoluble matrices such as polymeric resins will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. The compounds herein can be immobilized by covalently crosslinking the pyrimidine amino or hydroxy groups to an insoluble matrix. Similarly, compounds of this invention are incorporated into insoluble resins by binding the hydroxy of the phosphonate group or a hydroxymethyl R3 group to the matrix or resin using covalent linking agents heretofore known. Suitable linking methods are described in Cihlar (supra).<br>
The compounds of this invention also are useful as cross-linkers or spacers in preparing affinity absorption matrices (as opposed to functioning as affinity moieties per se as noted in the preceding paragraphs). The compounds herein contain a multiplicity of functional groups that are suitable as sites for cross-linking desired substances. It is conventional to link affinity reagents such as hormones, peptides, antibodies, enzymes, drugs, and the like to insoluble substrates. These insolubilized reagents are employed in known fashion to absorb substances from manufactured preparations, diagnostic samples and other impure mixtures. Similarly, immobilized enzymes are used to perform catalytic conversions with facile separation of enzyme from product.<br>
In some embodiments, it is not necessary that the compounds of this invention be cross-linked to insoluble materials. For example, they can be used to link analytes to detectable groups in preparing soluble diagnostic reagents.<br>
Methods for cross-linking using the substituent groups found in the compounds of this invention are well known in the art. For example, the phosphonic acid is used to form esters with alcohols or amides with amines. Similarly, the amino, halo, hydroxy and other reactive sites found on the pyrimidine are suitable. Of course, protection of reactive groups will be used where necessary while assembling the cross-linked reagent. In general, the inventive compounds are used by linking them through phosphonic acid to the hydroxy or amino groups of the linking partner, and covalently bonded to the<br>
other binding partner through another substituent of the compound of this invention. For example a first binding partner such as a steroid hormone is esterified to the phosphonic acid of this invention and then this conjugate is cross-linked through R3 hydroxymethyl to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose, whereby the immobilized steroid is obtained. Other chemistries for conjugation are well known. See, for example Maggio, "Enzyme-Immunoassay" (CRC, 1988, pp 71-135) and references cited therein.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations.<br>
The compounds of this invention and their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates (hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingredients) are formulated for administration by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The compounds and formulations preferably will be sterile.<br>
The active ingredients are placed into pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The formulations conveniently are presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
For external infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc), typically 0.2 to 15% w/w and most typically 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible<br>
ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.<br>
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxy groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogues.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. This phase may comprise an emulsifier alone, or a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. Suitable oils or fats include straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate or 2-ethylhexyl palmitate. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is typically is present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.01 to 20% by weight.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 20 and 500 microns in increments of 5 microns such as 30 microns, 35 microns, etc), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be<br>
delivered with other therapeutic agents such as pentamidine for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient.<br>
The present invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor. Veterinary carriers are materials for administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.<br>
Compounds herein optionally are used in controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more active compounds in which the release of the active ingredient is controlled and regulated to allow less frequent dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given compound. In general, the compounds are administered from controlled release systems such as the implant of WO 92/14450 or U.S /Patent 5,098,443, or the matrices of U.S. Patent 4,740,365 or US.Patent 5,141,752. Many others are known and are suitable for use herein.<br>
Therapeutic Administration Suitable routes for administration include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including ocular, buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravitreous, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural). The preferred route of administration will depend upon the condition of the patient, the toxicity of the compound and the site of infection, among other considerations known to the clinician.<br>
For each of the above-indicated therapeutic indications the amount required of an active ingredient (as above defined) will depend upon a number of factors including the severity of the condition to be treated, the infectious agent, whether the use is prophylactic or to treat an acute infection, the site of infection or pathology and other factors ultimately at the discretion of the attending physician or veterinarian. In general, however, a suitable dose for consideration by the clinician will be in the range of analogous methoxyphosphonates (see supra), taking into account differences in potency in in vitro testing, generally 0.1 to 250 mg per kilogram bodyweight of recipient per dose (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1 mg and 400 mg/Kg/dose in increments of 0.5 mg/Kg/dose such as 2.5 mg/Kg/dose, 3.0 mg/Kg/dose, 3.5 mg/Kg/dose, etc), typically in the range 0.5 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per dose and most usually in the range 1 to 300 mg per kilogram body weight per dose.<br>
The desired dose is administered at appropriate intervals in unit dosage forms, usually with a relatively higher induction dose and lower, less frequent maintenance doses. The compounds also are used prophylactically, for example, by administration on about from 1 to 7 days before viral infection. HPV tumors or growths and herpes lesions often are treated topically, either by local injection or by topical gels, ointments or the like.<br>
The compounds of the invention optionally are employed in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of the infections or conditions indicated above. Examples of such further therapeutic agents include agents that are effective for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections. These include but are not limited to the NRTIs, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT), 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T), carbovir (carbocyclic 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydroguanosine), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl), didanosine, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddc, zalcitabine), 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU), 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine, 2-deoxycoformycin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorouridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine, 6-azauridine, 5-fluoroorotic acid, methotrexate, triacetyluridine, l-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-l-p-D-arabinosyl)-5-iodocytidine (FIAC), tetrahydroimidazo(4,5,l-jk)-(l,4)-benzodiazepin-2(lH)-thione (TIBO) or other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. nevirapine, delaviridine, efavirens,<br>
daparivine, etc.), protease inhibitors (e.g. saquinavir, indinavir, ritonovir, amprenavir, and the like), 2'-nor-cyclicGMP, 6-methoxypurine arabinoside (ara-M), 6-methoxypurine arabinoside 2'-O-valerate, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), acyclic nucleosides such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, acyclic nucleotide analogues such as HPMPC, PMEA, PMEG, PMPA, PMPDAP, FPMPA, HPMPA and HPMPDAP, (2R, 5R)-9-[tetrahydro-5-(phosphonomethoxy)-2-furanyl]adenine, (2R, 5R)-l-[tetrahydro-5-(phosphonomethoxy)-2-furanyl] thymine, other antivirals including ribavirin (adenine arabinoside), 2-thio-6-azauridine, tubercidin, aurintricarboxylic acid, 3-deazaneoplanocin, neoplanocin, rimantidine, adamantine, and foscarnet (trisodium phosphonoformate.<br>
Synthesis Methods<br>
Compounds falling within the formula (I) are synthesized by alkylating the corresponding 6-hydroxypyrimidine base with dialkyl 2-<br>
chloroethoxymethylphosphonate (or its analogues yielding other R3 groups) in the presence of NaH, CS2CO3 or DBU (l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) in dipolar aprotic solvent, usually DMF, optionally followed by deprotection, e.g. with bromotrimethylsilane and subsequent hydrolysis. The product of the formula (I) is accompanied by formation of varying amounts of the corresponding N1-isomer, i.e. 2,4-disubstituted l-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]pyrimidin-6-one. It can be removed by chromatography as the neutral diester prior to the bromotrimethylsilane treatment.<br>
Another method of preparation of compounds of the formula (I) comprises the transformation of 2-substituted 4-chloro-6-[2-<br>
(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy]pyrimidine derivatives (and its R3 analogues) by reaction with primary or secondary amines in anhydrous solvents (e.g. ethanol), alkali hydroxide or alkali carbonate in water. This reaction can be catalyzed e.g. by 1,3,5-triazole, imidazole, or, to an advantage, with DABCO (diazabicyclooctane). The protecting groups optionally are then removed, e.g. by bromotrimethylsilane treatment and hydrolysis.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be also obtained by the reaction of 2,4-disubstituted 6-halogenopyrimidines with sodium alkoxide of dialkyl 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (or its analogues yielding other R3 groups) followed by optional deprotection. The advantage of this procedure consists in the formation of the required 06-isomer only. The selection of the suitable synthetic procedure depends on the availability of the heterocyclic pyrimidine derivative used as a starting material.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be also obtained by the reaction of 2,4-disubstituted 6-(2-hydroxyalkyl)pyrimidines with dialkyl p-toluenesulfonyloxymethylphosphonate in the presence of NaH. The starting materials are prepared by treatment of the appropriate 6-chloropyrimidine with a protected or unprotected diol in the presence of a base.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be further obtained by substitution at diverse positions of the pyrimidine ring. Thus, the 5-halo derivatives can be obtained by reactions with elemental halogen or by halogen anion exchange reactions.<br>
Z group amides or esters are converted to hydroxyl by hydrolysis.<br>
Monoesters are easily available from the diester or a mixture of di- and monoesters by treatment with lithium or sodium azide in DMF (A. Holy, "Synthesis 1998" 381-385 (1998)).<br>

This compound (1.0 g, 2.9 mmol) was treated with BrSiMe3 (4 mL) in acetonitrile (40 mL) overnight. The solvents were stripped down in vacuo, the residue codistilled with acetonitrile (2x25 mL) and water (50 mL) was added to the residue.

Purification of the desalted mixture on Dowex 1 column (elution with water) gave product which was crystallized from water to afford 0.95 g (65%) of 2,4-diamino-l-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]pyrimidine-(lH)-one, m.p. 228°C (water). Eup0.90. For C7Hi3N405P.H20 (282.2) calculated 29.79%C, 5.36%H, 19.85%N, 10.98%P; found 29.76%C, 5.22%H, 20.01 %N, 10.92%P. Mass spectrum: 349.2 (MH+)(100); 265.1(MH+-2x iPr)(35); 126 (BH+) (26). UV-spectrum [Xmax (max)] (pH 2): 264 (18000), (pH 7): 267 (12200). The ax value coincides with the value published for 2,4-diamino-l-methylpyrimidine-6(lH)-one (268 nm). 1H NMR (CD3SOCD3): 3.59 d, 2 H, J(CH2,P)=8.4 (CH2P); 3.601, 2 H, J(2',l')=6.1 (H-2'); 3.96 t, 2 H, J(l',2')=6.1 (H-1'); 4.61 s, 1 H (H-5); 5.88 bs, 2 H and 6.61 bs, 2 H (2 x NH2)H NMR (D2O): 3.48 d, 2 H, J(CH2,P)=8.4 (CH2P); 3.76 t, 2 H, J(l',2')=5.2 (H-1'); 4.09 t, 2H, J(2',l')=5.2 (H-2'); 5.06 s, 1 H (H-5). 13C NMR (D2O): 45.15 (C-l'); 70.41 d, J(CH2-P)=154.7<br>

Two signals of NH2 groups (8 6.61 and 5.88) which are observed in 1H NMR spectrum in DMSO exclude the substitution at the exo-positions 2-NH2 and/or 4-NH2 and are consistent with the expected substitution at N(l).<br>

Viruses. The origins of MSV, HIV type 1 (HIV-1) (strain IIIB and Ba-L), HIV-2 (strain ROD) and FIV (strain Petaluma) have been described previously (Balzarini et al., AIDS 5: 21-28,1991; De Clercq et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 137:59O-594,1971; Egberink et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 87:3087-3091,1990; Hartmann et al., Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 5:13-19,1994; Popovic et al., Science 224:497-500,1984). HIV-I(IIIB) and HIV-2(ROD) stocks were obtained from supernatants of virus-infected MT-4 cell cultures. HIV-lBaLwas expanded in human primary M/M, whose supernatants were collected, filtered and stored at -80°C before use. Characteristics of viral stocks used for this study were 2.1 x 108 HIV-RNA genomes/ml (corresponding to 35 ng of p24 antigen) and 5,000 tissue culture infectious doses 50% per ml (TCIDso/ml) as assessed by virus titration in other primary M/M cultures. The isolation and characterization of the clinical HIV-1 isolates LIS, L6S and L6S/PMEA has been reported (Thormar et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:3283-3287,1995; Van Laethem et al., AIDS 15:553-561, 2001). The HIV-1/L1S clinical isolate was derived from a patient not treated with NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) or ANPs and cultured without the selective pressure of any drugs. Therefore, it contained no obvious mutations that are characteristic for NRTI- or ANP-treated patients. HIV-1/L6S is a clinical isolate from a drug-treated individual cultured without the selective pressure of any drugs. As is characteristic for NRTI-treated patients, it contained S68G, K70T, V75I, F77L, F116Y and Q151M mutations in its RT. HIV-1/L6S/PMEA is the clinical isolate HIV-1/L6S that has been isolated after culturing the virus for 11 passages in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMEA (adefovir). It gained, in addition to the mutations mentioned for HIV-1/L6S, also the PMEA-characteristic K65R mutation in its reverse transcriptase (RT).<br>

Compounds. Following compounds were used in this study: 1, 2,4-diamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy]pyrimidine; 2, 2,4-diamino-6-{ [2-(phos-phonomethoxy)ethyl]-sulfanyl}pyrimidine; 3,4-amino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy) ethoxy]pyrimidine; 4, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy] pyrimidine; 5, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-{ [2-(phosphono-methoxy)ethyl]sulfanyl} pyrimidine; 6, 2~amino-4-dimethylamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)-ethoxy] pyrimidine; 1, 2~amino-4-cyclopropylamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy) ethoxy] pyrimi-dine; 8, 4-amino-2-methylsulfanyl-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy] pyrimidine; 9, 2-amino-4-methyl-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy]pyrimidine; 10, 2,4-diamino-6-(S)-[2-(phosphonome-thoxy)propoxy]pyrimidine;ll, 2,4-diamino-6-(R)-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propoxy]pyrimidine;PMEA, 9-[(2-phosphono-methoxy)ethyl]adenine; (R)-PMPA, (R)-9-[(2-phosphonomethoxy)-propyl]adenine.<br>
In vitro antiviral assays. The activity against HIV-1- and HIV-2-induced cytopathicity was examined in MT-4 cell cultures at day 5 post infection and based on the determination of cell viability by trypan blue dye staining or in CEM cell cultures at day 4 to 5 post infection and based on the microscopical examination of virus-induced giant cell formation. HIV-1 and HIV-2 were added at 100 CCID50 to the cell cultures.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were isolated by density centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Nycomed Pharma, AS Diagnostics, Oslo, Norway) and stimulated with phytohemagglutin (PHA) (Sigma Chemical Co., Bornem, Belgium) for 3 days. The activated cells (PHA-stimulated blasts) were washed with PBS and viral infections were done as described by the AIDS clinical trial group protocols. Briefly, PBMCs (2 x 105/200 well) were plated in the presence of serial dilutions of the test compound and were infected with HIV stocks at 1000 CCID50 per mL. At day 4 post-infection, 125 ul of the supernatant of the infected cultures was removed and replaced with 150 ul of fresh medium containing the test compounds at the appropriate concentrations.<br>
At 7 days after plating the cells, p24 antigen was detected in the culture supernatant by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NEN, Paris, France).<br>
Human primary macrophages (M/M) were prepared and purified as follows. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), obtained from healthy HIV-1-negative donors were separated over a Ficoll gradient and seeded in 48-<br>
well plates at 1.8 x 106 cells/well in 1 ml of RPMI1640 containing 20% heat-inactivated, endotoxin- and mycoplasma-free fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 4 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 [ig/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) (hereinafter referred to as complete medium). Five days after plating and culturing the PBMC at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere enriched with 5% CCVadherent cells were carefully removed with repeated washings with warmed RPMI-1640, leaving a monolayer of adherent cells which were finally incubated in complete medium. Cells treated under these conditions have previously been shown to be &gt;97% M/M, as determined by cytofluorimetric analysis. Macrophages were treated for 30 minutes with the compounds, then challenged with 300 TCIDso/ml of HIV-lBaL. Two hours after virus challenge, M/M were washed to remove the viral inoculum, complete medium containing the appropriate compound concentrations was replaced where requested, and the M/M were then cultured for the duration of the experiments. Each compound concentration was run in triplicate while positive controls were run in sextuplicate. Therefore, compounds were replaced each time of medium change. Supernatants were collected at day 14 after infection for assessment of virus production by analysis of HIV-l-p24 antigen.<br>
For the anti-FIV assays, 105 CrFK cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were cultured with 2 ml of culture medium/well containing 2.5% of fetal calf serum in the presence of various drug concentrations. The assays were carried out in triplicate. After a 1-hr incubation period at 37°C, cells were infected with FIV. Virus was left in contact with the cultures for 1 day, after which the medium was removed and new medium containing the appropriate drug<br>
concentrations was added. After 6 days, the presence of FIV p24 antigen was examined by an antigen capture assay.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the test compounds on MSV-induced transformation of murine embryo fibroblast C3H/3T3 cell cultures was examined microscopically at day 6 post infection. MSV was added at 75 focus-forming units to the cell cultures. The detailed procedures for the antiretroviral evaluations has been described in detail before (Balzarini et al., AIDS 5:21-28,1991; Balzarini et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37:332-338,1993; De Clercq et al, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 137:59O-594,1971).<br>
Anti-MSV activity in vivo. The inhibitory effects of the compounds on the initiation of MSV-induced tumor formation and survival of MSV-inoculated mice were evaluated as previously described (Balzarini et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:332-336,1989; Balzarini et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4961-4965,1991; Balzarini et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37:332-338,1993). Briefly, 2- to 3-day-old NMRI mice were each inoculated subcutaneously in the left hind leg with MSV and treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of test compound at 4 h prior to virus infection (day 1) followed by a single dose of test compound at days 2, 3,4 and 5. Drug doses were 50, 20, 8, 4 and/or 2 mg/kg/day for tenofovir [(R)-PMPA], adefovir (PMEA), 1 (designated PMEO-2,4-di-NH2-Pym), 2 (designated PMES-2,4-di-NH2-Pym) and 11 (designated (R)-PMPO-2,4-di-NH2-Pym). No toxicity was observed for the highest dose of the test compound. The appearance and growth of MSV-induced tumors at the site of virus inoculation, as well as survival of the mice for up to 30 days post infection, were recorded daily.<br>
Cytostatic and antimetabolic effect of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates in vitro. The assays to examine the inhibition of CEM cell growth by the test compounds have been described previously (Balzarini et al., AIDS 5:21-28,1991). The 50% cytostatic concentration (CC50) was defined as the concentration of compound that reduced the number of living cells by 50%. To measure MT-4 cell toxicity of the test compounds, 5 x 104 MT-4 cells were incubated in the wells of 96-well microplates in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the test compounds for 5 days at 37°C The CC50 was then calculated from the<br>
number of living cells counted under a microscope by the trypan blue exclusion method.<br>
The incorporation of [methtyl-3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine and [3H]leucine into the methanol-insoluble CEM cell fraction was also measured in microplates. To each well were added 105 CEM cells, 5.9 pmol (0.25 µCi) of [methyl-3H]thymidine, 38 pmol (1.0 µCi) of [3H]uridine and 19 pmol (1.0 µCi) [4,5-3H]leucine, and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 20 h at 37°C in a humidified, C02-controlled atmosphere. At the end of this incubation period, the contents of the wells (200 µl) were brought onto 25-mm glass fiber filters (type A/G; Gelman Instrument Co., Ann Arbor, MI) mounted on a Millipore 3025 sampling manifold apparatus. The filters were washed twice with cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), twice with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, once with cold ethanol, and once with cold ether. The filters were then allowed to dry for 10 min at 60°C and assayed for radioactivity in a toluene-based scintillant.<br>
Anti-HIV-1 activity of acyclic pyrimidine nucleoside phosphonate analogues in CEM cell cultures. A prerequisite for potent antiretroviral activity is the presence of an amino group at C-2 of the pyrimidine ring together with an amino group at C-4 (i.e.compounds 1, 2,11) or a hydroxyl group at C-4 (i.e. compound 4) (Table 1). These 6-PMEO and 6-PMPO substituted pyrimidine structures resulted in an anti-HIV activity with an EC50 that ranked between 0.80 and 2.0 ug/ml. Lack of an amino group at C-2 (i.e. compound 3 or 8), or the presence of a dimethylamino or methyl or cyclopropylamino at C-4 (i.e. compounds 6, 9 and 7, respectively) resulted in complete annihilation of the antiretroviral activity (Table 1). Thioether derivatives were, as a rule, 5- to 1O-fold less active than the corresponding ether derivatives (i.e. compare compound 2 with compound 1), or even completely inactive (i.e. compound 5). Interestingly, the antiretroviral activity of the novel pyrimidine ANPs showed marked enantiospecificity in their action against HIV-1. The (R)-6-PMPO pyrimidine derivative 11 was markedly more inhibitory to these viruses than the corresponding (S)-6-PMPO pyrimidine derivative (10) (Table 1). The residual<br>
antiviral activity noted for the (S)-enantiomer might be due to the contamination with (R)-enantiomer originating from the chiral starting material (1-2%).<br>
For most of the compounds, poor, if any cytotoxicity was noted at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, with a striking exception for compound 4 (CC50: 2.5 µg/mL for CEM cells). The antivirally most active 6-PMEO-2,4-di-NH2 pyrimidine derivative (compound 1) showed a CC50 of 11 ug/mL for CEM cells, whereas its corresponding thioether analogue 2 and the (R)-6-PMPO-2,4-di-NH2 pyrimidine derivative 11 had CC50 values around 60 ug/ml (Table 1). Interestingly, the 5-bromo-derivative of 1 was active against HIV-1 in CEM cell cultures at 2.5ug/mL, and not toxic at 100 ug/mL. Neither compounds 1 nor 2, nor compound 11 were inhibitory towards [3H]dThd, [3H]Urd and [3H]leu incorporation into TCA-insoluble CEM cell material within a 12 hour incubation period at 200 ug/mL. Also, PMEA and (R)-PMPA were not inhibitory to macromolecular synthesis at this drug concentration (data not shown).<br>
Anti-retrovirus activity of acyclic pyrimidine nucleoside phosphonate analogues in several virus/cell systems. The 6-PMEO derivatives 1 and 4, the 6-PME thioether (6-PMES) 2, and the (K)-6-PMPO derivative 11 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against several in vitro retrovirus models (Table 2). As a rule, the antiviral activity values of the test compounds found for HIV-1 (IIIB) in CEM cell cultures (Table 1) matched very closely the antiviral activity values found for HIV-2(ROD) in CEM cells, HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT-4 cell cultures, and FIV in feline Crandell kidney cells. Thus, the EC50 values of compound 1 for HIV ranged between 0.29 and 0.80 ug/mL, and for compound 11 between 1.3 and 3.0 ug/mL. These values were close to those observed for the reference compounds PMEA (adefovir) (EC50: 0.96-2.0 ug/mL) and (R)-PMPA (tenofovir) (EC50: 0.36-0.52 ug/mL). When the 6-PMEO and 6-(R)-PMPO derivatives were evaluated against HIV-1 in primary cells [HIV-1(IIIB) in PBL and HIV-l(Ba-L) in monocyte/macrophages (M/M)], the antiretroviral potency was even more pronounced. Indeed, compounds 1 and 11 inhibited the virus in PBL at an EC50 of 0.07 and 0.12 ug/mL, respectively, compared with 1.9 and 0.33 ug/mL for the<br>
reference compounds PMEA and (R)-PMPA. The 6-PMEO and (R)-6-PMPO derivatives were even more inhibitory to HIV-1 (Ba-L) in M/M, as also observed for PMEA and (R)-PMPA. As a rule, the compounds proved less cytotoxic in MT-4, as compared to CEM cells, and not toxic at 100 ug/mL in monocyte/macrophages.<br>
Since it has been previously shown that PMEA and (R)-PMPA exhibit pronounced inhibitory activity against murine Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) in both cell culture and newborn mice, the novel 6-PMEO and (R)-6-PMPO derivatives were also evaluated for their in vitro activity against MSV. Compounds 1,11 and 4 were highly inhibitory against MSV-induced C3H cell transformation. The EC50 values were as low as 0.05-0.15 \ig/mL (Table 2).<br>
Effect of natural nucleosides and nucleobases on the anti-HIV activity of the acyclic pyrimidine nucleoside phosphonate analogues in cell culture. It is well known that the anti-HIV activity of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC, zalcitabine) can be affected (i.e. diminished) in the presence of natural nucleosides such as dThd and dCyd (Balzarini et al., Textbook of AIDS Medicine, chapter 49, Broder, S., T.C. Merigan, and D. Bolognesi, eds. Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, Maryland, pp. 751-772,1994; Balzarini et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37:332-338,1993). Therefore, to estimate whether the presence of natural nucleosides and nucleobases could influence the anti-HIV activity of the novel 6-PMEO and (R)-6-PMPO pyrimidine derivatives, the effect of subtoxic concentrations of the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine (dThd) and 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd), the purine nucleosides adenosine (Ado) and guanosine (Guo), and the nucleobase adenine (Ade), were examined (Table 3). None of the natural nucleosides and nucleobases had any measurable influence on the anti-HIV-1 activity of the test compounds in CEM cell cultures. In all cases, the antiretroviral activity of the compounds was fully preserved, as was also the case for the reference compounds PMEA, (R)-PMPA and PMEG (Table 3).<br>
Efficacy of acyclic pyrimidine nucleoside phosphonate analogues against MSV-induced tvimor formation in newborn NMRI mice. The 6-PMEO<br>
derivative 1 and its thioether analogue 2, and the (R)-6-PMPO derivative 11 were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on MSV-induced tumor formation and associated death in newborn NMRI mice (Table 4). PMEA (adefovir) and (R)-PMPA (tenofovir) were included as reference compounds. Of the novel 6-PMEO and (R)-6-PMPO derivatives, compound 1 proved to be most efficient in preventing MSV-induced tumor formation and associated death of newborn NMRI mice (Table 4). At least 80% of mice were protected from tumor formation at 50 and 20 mg/kg, and the remaining mice that developed tumors survived for more than 30 days post infection. At a dose as low as 2 mg/kg, compound 1 could still prevent tumor formation in 5% of the mice and afforded 15% long-term survivors. Compound 1 had a comparable ability to prevent tumor formation and associated animal death as PMEA and (K)-PMPA (Table 4). In contrast, the corresponding thioether derivative 2 was unable to prevent tumor formation at all doses tested, and it afforded 20% long-term survivors at a dose of 8-50 mg/kg. The capacity of the (R)-6-PMPO derivative 11 to prevent tumor formation and associated death was intermediate between that observed for compounds 1 and 2. All drugs delayed MSV-induced tumor formation in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 1 had an inhibitory effect that was comparable with that of (R)-PMPA and PMEA. Compound 11 was inferior to compound 1, and compound 2 only showed a pronounced delay in tumor formation at a dose of 50 mg/kg. As noted for tumor formation, delay of associated animal death was also afforded in a dose-dependent manner, and compound 1 was at least as efficient in delaying death as the reference drugs PMEA and (R)-PMPA.<br>
Sensitivity of mutated HIV-1 strains towards acyclic pyrimidine nucleoside phosphonate analogues in CEM cell cultures. Compounds 1, 2 and 11 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 (IIIB) strains containing the nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)-specific L100I, K103N, Y181C and Y188H mutations in the RT. All three compounds retained full activity against these mutant virus strains (data not shown). The same compounds were also evaluated on their inhibitory effect on the clinical isolates HIV-1/L1S, HIV-1/L6S and HIV-1 /L6S/PMEA (Table 5). PMEA and (R)-PMPA were included as<br>
reference compounds. Compound 1 retained pronounced antiviral activity against the three virus strains. Compounds 2 and particularly 11 showed clearly decreased activity against the HIV-1/L6S/PMEA isolate and so did PMEA and (R)-PMPA. Thus, the multi-NRTI resistance mutations (S68G, K70T, V75L F77L, F116Y and Q151M) and the PMEA-characteristic K65R mutation present in HIV-1/L6S/PMEA did not markedly affect the antiviral potency of compound 1 and PMEA (~ 3.6- to 4.5-fold increased EC50) while more extensively decreasing sensitivity to the other ANPs (Table 5).<br>
