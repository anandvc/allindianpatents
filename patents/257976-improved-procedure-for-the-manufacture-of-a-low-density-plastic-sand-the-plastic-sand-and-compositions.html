				<td>IMPROVED PROCEDURE FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A LOW-DENSITY<br>
PLASTIC SAND , THE PLASTIC SAND AND COMPOSITIONS.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.<br>
This invention refers to a low-density plastic sand<br>
based on recycled low-density polyethylene and the<br>
compositions formed by it, the use of plastics in the world<br>
has flooded vital spaces, contaminating soil and the water<br>
stratum with a wide variety of waste, which because of their<br>
slow biodegradation, have forced us to search alternatives<br>
for the use of such materials, recycling and withdrawing them<br>
from open-air dumps where, because of effects of the<br>
environment (the sun, air, etc.), they let off gases and<br>
toxic fumes that aggravate the deterioration of soil and<br>
water strata, as well as the creation, accumulation and<br>
proliferation of bacteria and parasite animals; on the other<br>
hand, conventional sand as a basic material for mortar (sand,<br>
cement and water) is used in all constructions to join blocks<br>
and bricks , and the process followed in producing them also<br>
damages and contaminates the environment, in addition to the<br>
high transportation costs, which significantly increase<br>
housing and building costs.<br>
There are different methods of recycling low-density<br>
polyethylene, but none as the one contained in this<br>
invention; this fine sand is obtained or manufactured from<br>
all kinds of recycled low-density polyethylene plastics, that<br>
when smelted are transformed into fine sand that is 53%<br>
lighter than conventional sand and can be used as mortar or<br>
in bricks and concrete parts.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention refers to a low-density plastic sand<br>
based on recycled or virgin low-density polyethylene, to the<br>
process of obtainment and fabrication, and to the<br>
compositions formed by it, the plastic sand obtained through<br>
the fabrication process is obtained by using and kind of lowdensity<br>
polyethylene, as for example, drinking straws,<br>
glasses and disposable plates, bags, bottles, etc., recovered<br>
from trash dumps as solid waste, or from any other industrial<br>
source where it can be found. The raw material of the sand of<br>
this invention consists of all kinds of low-density<br>
polyethylene found in trash dumps as solid or industrial<br>
waste, when polyethylene is heated up to the smelting point<br>
or above it is transformed and a change surprisingly occurs,<br>
that is, it become less ramified and less dense, and<br>
therefore, more flexible; this rearrangement of reorientation<br>
of polymer chains in the low-density polyethylene is carried<br>
out through this procedure to produce the plastic sand, once<br>
the plastic which is low-density polyethylene is reunited, it<br>
is placed in a closed container, which is heated when applied<br>
direct fire, the container has a outlet conduct through which<br>
the gases produced from the smelting and part of combustion<br>
produced during this stage come out directly to the nozzles<br>
of the burner thereby eliminating those gases through<br>
combustion, avoiding contamination of the environment, this<br>
container also has a feeding means and a temperature<br>
regulator, the recommended interval temperature to carry out<br>
the smelting process and part of combustion of the plastic is<br>
approximately from 65°C to 90°C, preferably 70°C to 80°C<br>
during 3 to 20 minutes, preferably 3 to 5 minutes, it is<br>
important to not go beyond this range and not go above 100°C,<br>
because if this temperature is surpassed the raw material<br>
will be lost, that is, it begins to burn and becomes carbon,<br>
losing reorientation and the molecular rearrangement of the<br>
low-density polyethylene polymer, enormously affecting its<br>
qualities, that is, it is transformed into ashes in the form<br>
of gas, which are totally eliminated when reaching the<br>
burner, by carrying out this step with the polyethylene, the<br>
highly ramified chains that constitute the polymer are<br>
broken, reoriented and rearranged, forming new non-ramified<br>
chains with new properties, as for example, flexibility, that<br>
is, the plastic becomes less dense and more flexible, to this<br>
plastic material with new chains a predetermined amount of<br>
petroleum in solid form, known as curved tar from waste is<br>
added, in an amount varying approximately from 0.1% to 30%,<br>
preferably 2% in proportion to the weight of the raw material<br>
of smelted polyethylene, leaving the union of these materials<br>
at the same temperature during 10 to 35 minutes.<br>
The tar astoundingly favors the formation of a larger<br>
and more flexible polymeric molecule.<br>
Once having thoroughly mixed the plastic and the tar,<br>
the mixture is taken out of the container to be poured on a<br>
clean surface or in containers until it crystallizes at room<br>
temperature, once it crystallizes, the substrate formed,<br>
which is brittle and therefore forms different sizes of<br>
grain, is lifted from the surface or containers and sieved,<br>
passing it through sieves of different sizes, which allows to<br>
obtain control of the diameter of the grain according to the<br>
requirements or intended use. The size of the crystal or<br>
grain may be vary very fine to one inch, larger grains that<br>
remain in the sieve are collected to be further passed<br>
through a mill, reducing their diameter to be further<br>
sieved.<br>
If the plastic sand thus obtained must be transported<br>
from one place to another, we recommend providing it a little<br>
dampness to avoid losing it because of its extreme lightness.<br>
The following is a description of the procedure followed<br>
to manufacture or fabricate plastic sand with this invention,<br>
that comprises the following steps:<br>
A) Collect raw material consisting of all kinds of lowdensity<br>
polyethylene found in trash dumps as solid or<br>
industrial waste; B) once having collected the plastic<br>
consisting of low-density polyethylene, it is placed in a<br>
closed container that is heated by applying direct fire, the<br>
container has a outlet conduct through which the gases<br>
released from smelting and part of combustion produced during<br>
this stage come out directly to the nozzles of the burner<br>
thereby eliminating those gases through combustion, avoiding<br>
contamination of the environment, this container also has<br>
feeding means and a temperature regulator, the recommended<br>
interval temperature for the smelting process and part of<br>
combustion of the plastic is approximately 65°C to 90°C,<br>
preferably 70°C to 80°C during 3 to 20 minutes, preferably 3<br>
to 5 minutes, it is important to not go beyond this range and<br>
not reach above 100°C, because if this temperature is<br>
surpassed the raw material will be lost, that is, it begins<br>
to burn and form carbon, losing reorientation and the<br>
molecular rearrangement of the low-density polyethylene<br>
polymer, which enormously affects its qualities, that is, it<br>
is transformed into ashes in the form of gas, which are<br>
totally eliminated when reaching the burner C) a<br>
predetermined amount of solid petroleum known as curved tar<br>
obtained from waste is added, this amount varies<br>
approximately 1% to 30%, preferably 2% in proportion to the<br>
weight of the raw material of smelted polyethylene, and<br>
leaving the union of these materials at the same temperature<br>
for 10 to 35 minutes; D) once the plastic and the tar are<br>
perfectly mixed, the mixture of these materials is taken out<br>
of the container to be poured on a clean surface or in<br>
containers until it crystallized at room temperature; F) once<br>
having crystallized, the substrate formed, which is brittle<br>
and therefore forms different sizes of grain, is lifted from<br>
the surface or containers and is sieved, passing it through<br>
sieves of different sizes, which allows to obtain control in<br>
the diameter of the grain according to the requirements or<br>
intended use; G) The size of the crystal or grain may be from<br>
very fine to one inch, larger grains that remain in the sieve<br>
are collected to further be passed through a mill and reduce<br>
their diameter, to be later sieved according to F) above.<br>
The properties and characteristics of the plastic sand<br>
obtained through this manufacture or fabrication procedure<br>
are obtained in the laboratory, with the results and various<br>
tests mentioned below.<br>
"Granulometry of the sand"<br>
The plastic sand was submitted to the granulometry test<br>
to determine its fineness standard; and in addition, to know<br>
the following elements:<br>
1. Volumetric Weight<br>
2 . Density<br>
3. Absorption<br>
4. Loss through Washing<br>
5. Colorimetry<br>
First granulometry test<br>
For the granulometry of the plastic sand, a 500 gr.<br>
sample was taken, that was passed through meshes numbers 8,<br>
14, 36, 48 and 100, the powder was collected, with the<br>
following results:<br>

Fineness Standard = 218/100<br>
Fineness Standard = 2.18 (fine plastic sand).<br>
This plastic sand may already be classified by its<br>
fineness standard, based on designation 4 by the A.S.T.M,<br>
according to the following table.<br>

As the result of the fineness standard was 2.18, it<br>
ranges within classification 1.50 to 2.50, and results in a<br>
class of fine plastic sand.<br>
Second granulometry test and determination of the fineness<br>

Fineness Standard = 81.01/100<br>
Fineness Standard =0.81 (very fine plastic sand).<br>
This plastic sand may already be classified by its<br>
fineness standard, based on designation 4 by the A.S.T.M,<br>
according to the following table.<br>
(Table Removed)As the result of the fineness standard was 0.81, it<br>
ranges within classification 0.50 to 1.50, and results in a<br>
class of fine plastic sand.<br>
Volumetric weight of the plastic sand<br>
The volumetric weight of a material varies according to<br>
the compacting condition of the sample, as well as the<br>
dampness it contains. According to the applicable regulatory<br>
requirements, except for special cases, the material is<br>
always used in a saturated and superficially dry manner to<br>
determine the volumetric weight, without compacting.<br>
In this case, a cubic deposit made of thick nondeformable<br>
wood was used, with a 5-liter capacity. This known<br>
weight deposit (empty weight) was filled with a scoop, it was<br>
softly sieved inside the cube with a molder' s spoon at a<br>
height of not more than 2 inches from the upper edge, and<br>
then levels and weighed, obtaining the following result for<br>
the plastic sand:<br>
W.V. = (total weight - empty weight)/volume<br>
W.V. = (4.566 kg. - 2.320 kg.) 5/ Its.<br>
W.V.4 9 9 kg./m<br>
Density of the plastic sand<br>
To determine the density of the plastic sand, the<br>
Lechateelier or Chapman flask was used, where water was<br>
placed up to the O.C.C. mark, then 50 gr of saturated and<br>
superficially dry plastic sand were deposited in the flask<br>
always continuing to agitate it, with revolving movements, to<br>
eliminate the air bubbles.<br>
The flask was left to rest until the bubbles rose and<br>
disappeared, to be able to apply a new reading, which<br>
correctly gave the volume dislodged by the 50 gr of plastic<br>
sand placed, and resulted in the following:<br>
Density = Weight / Volume = 50 gr/ 23.8 C.C. =2.1<br>
Absorption of the sand<br>
After performing the test on the saturated and<br>
superficially dry sand, a sample is taken with an exact<br>
weight of 500 gr and placed on a tray to be left to totally<br>
dry at a temperature of 60°C. It is then placed in a clean<br>
porcelain and placed to cool in a dryer for 20 minutes, after<br>
which it is weighed again.<br>
The difference between both weights reported the<br>
absorption of water, which is indicated in the percentage of<br>
water with respect to the dry weight, in our case, the<br>
absorption based on the weight of the dry material was:<br>
Absorption = (500 - 497.8) / 497.8)*100 = 0.441%<br>
This test, together with the density test, provide<br>
corrective data in order to obtain a quality control in<br>
producing the concrete.<br>
Saturated and superficially dry plastic sand<br>
Plastic sand has a dark color, and in order to obtain a<br>
saturated and superficially dry sand, 50 gr of this material<br>
to be saturated were placed in water during 24 hours, after<br>
which the highest amount possible of water was removed<br>
through known methods, being careful that powder is not<br>
washed away.<br>
The material then begins to slowly dry on a furnace. To<br>
avoid altering the process, temperatures below 110°C are<br>
recommended, always continuously removing the plastic sand<br>
until all the free water disappears, and then continue with<br>
the drying process caused by the sun or wind, until the<br>
plastic sand no longer forms lumps when squeezed in one's<br>
hand or when pressing a handful between both palms of the<br>
hands.<br>
This behavior showed that the material was very near the<br>
condition being looked for, and therefore, the test was<br>
applied with a cone made of sheet.<br>
The cone was totally filled with plastic sand and was<br>
pounded, pressed 25 times on the free surface of a tamper<br>
with a circular section that has an area with a one inch<br>
diameter (2.54 c.m) and a 12 ounce weight.<br>
The mold was filled up to its capacity with plastic<br>
sand, which was carefully withdrawn from it, with the result<br>
that the sand took the shape of the mold. This proved that it<br>
still had superficial dampness that gave it an apparent<br>
cohesion.<br>
The tests of the cone were continued two more times<br>
until the moment when the material obtained the desired<br>
condition, having taken its natural resting angle.<br>
Loss through washing<br>
This test was performed to know the amount of silt the<br>
sand might have, as on some occasions the sand it is not<br>
featured in the sand on the trays and is placed directly on<br>
the ground, which might influence in increasing contractions<br>
of the concrete and in reducing its resistance.<br>
A sample of entirely dry plastic sand with a dry weight<br>
of 600 grams was taken and placed in mesh #200 and washing<br>
was begun, until running water that passed through mesh came<br>
out totally clean.<br>
The washed plastic sand was collected and dried again on<br>
the stove, always taking care that the organic particles<br>
which it might contain did not get burned. Once the plastic<br>
was dried, it was weighed again and the difference with the<br>
original weight gives the weight of the power contained in<br>
the sand, which was expressed in percentage with respect to<br>
the original weight, providing the following data:<br>
Loss through washing = /500 gr of the sample - 487.5/500,)*<br>
100 = 2.5%.<br>
According to standards, the sands accepted must have a<br>
loss below 5%, in this case the result was 2.5%. This result<br>
was because the material used is polyethylene (drinking<br>
straws, disposable plates and plastic bags).<br>
Test to determine dampness in fine sand<br>
To begin this test, the porcelain capsule was first<br>
washed with the intention of eliminating impurities, it was<br>
then placed on the stove for 10 minutes at 100°C, it was<br>
taken out and placed on a glass dryer for about 15 minutes.<br>
The scale was gauged and the empty capsule was weighed,<br>
immediately after the sample was placed in the porcelain was<br>
weighed (the sample weighed 34.3 grams), it was placed on the<br>
stove at 60°C for approximately 2 hours, the sample was<br>
withdrawn and placed on the dryer for approximately 20<br>
minutes.<br>
The final result was 69.9 grams; consequently, the<br>
dampness content was 0.1 grams.<br>
Colorimetry<br>
The colorimetry test provides an index of the content or<br>
organic matter or other elements in the plastic sand, that<br>
may be less or above what a so-called "normal color" is.<br>
The test was performed in a 250 ml capacity suckingbottle,<br>
where approximately 125 ml of plastic sand were<br>
placed per test.<br>
A 3% solution of caustic soda (NaOH) was added (one<br>
liter of water with 30 gr of caustic soda (NaOH) up to the<br>
200 ml mark, level that together with additions of solution<br>
must be kept in the flask after having been vigorously<br>
shaken. It was left to rest for 24 hours, after which the<br>
color of the solution in the bottle is compared with the<br>
normal colored glass.<br>
Data obtained from this test correspond to a minimum of<br>
organic matter, because the polyethylene used in preparing<br>
the plastic sand is obtained from waste.<br>
The analysis of the result of determining ashes at a<br>
975° temperature shows us a low percentage, because the<br>
sample had a 25% of impurity in weight, the reason why the<br>
final percentage of the elements analyzed was as follows:<br>
(Table Removed)The plastic sand obtained is an alternative construction<br>
material, of low cost, fire-proof, insulating, thermal, easy<br>
to handle, lighter than conventional sand, compatible with<br>
conventional sand, in addition to a high resistance to<br>
compression stress and can be used in walls and slabs<br>
together with other materials without affecting their<br>
qualities, as aggregate when used in mortars and concrete in<br>
at least 30%, by being lighter, less dense and even so,<br>
preserves its volume with that of normal sand, plastic sand<br>
preserves a minimum of dampness, which provides consistency,<br>
avoiding that its lightness not be as volatile, avoiding<br>
complications when placing the material together and<br>
transporting it.<br>
Among its chemical qualities, plastic sand contains a<br>
high resistance to fire, of approximately 80 to 100°C, and<br>
begins to melt at one fourth of its amount at 200°C without<br>
changing its structure, characteristic which it shares with<br>
the material with which it is combined, either mortar or in<br>
bricks, providing higher resistance to fire, water, dampness<br>
and wear, extending its useful life 10 times more than<br>
conventional materials.<br>
One of the main characteristics of this product is that,<br>
being very similar to normal sand, it has many uses in the<br>
field of construction, because of its origin from recycled<br>
polyethylene it reduces the costs in any construction or<br>
edification.<br>
The following are some of its qualities:<br>
30% cheaper than conventional sand<br>
No specialized material is required in order to<br>
produce it<br>
Does not require skilled hand labor<br>
It reduces the cost of structures up to 50%<br>
- Among the physical qualities, the size of the grain<br>
runs from fine up to % inch (1.9 cm)<br>
Its volumetric weight is 449 Kg/m3<br>
Among its qualities, it is resistant to fire from 80<br>
to 100°C without modifying its structure, it begins to<br>
melt in one fourth part at 210°C<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
The following composition of plastic sand is prepared<br>
with the procedure described above, the plastic sand includes<br>
2% of waste tar, in proportion to the weight of the lowdensity<br>
polyethylene plastic material of 5, 4, 12, 200 and<br>
1000 grams, letting the elements join together at the same<br>
temperature for 10 minutes, by using plastic sand in mortars<br>
(normally water, sand, cement), one must have the following<br>
specification: 50% natural sand and 50% plastic sand, in<br>
addition to water and cement; if it will be used in parks and<br>
gardens, it is important to make a detailed analysis with<br>
experts in the field to be able to mix it as follows, 55%<br>
normal sand and 45% plastic sand.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same procedure as in the previous example, but using<br>
a composition of plastic sand that includes polyethylene,<br>
that may vary between 55, 10, 30, 200 or 500 kilograms with<br>
2% curved tar obtained from waste; with this plastic sand<br>
obtained, several kinds of bricks are produced, that include<br>

to cover all aspects of the invention clearly as observed in<br>
the attached claims. Several modifications, equivalent<br>
processes, as well as numerous compositions and procedures to<br>
which this invention may be applicable and shall be clear and<br>
easy for experts in the art on which this invention focuses,<br>
with respect to the time when reviewing the specification.<br>
I put on record that to this date, the best method known<br>
by the applicant in order to put into practice the abovementioned<br>
invention, is the one that results clear from this<br>
de-scription of the invention.<br>
Having described the above invention, the content of the<br>
following claims are claimed as property:<br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.- A manufacturing or fabrication procedure of<br>
plastic sand based on recycled low-density polyethylene<br>
plastic, featured for containing the following steps:<br>
A) Collect raw material consisting of all kinds of lowdensity<br>
polyethylene found in trash dumps as solid or<br>
industrial waste; B) once having collected the plastic<br>
consisting of low-density polyethylene, it is placed in a<br>
closed container that is heated when applied direct fire, the<br>
container has a outlet conduct through which the smelted<br>
gases and part of combustion produced during this stage come<br>
out directly to the nozzles of the burner, thereby<br>
eliminating those gases through combustion, avoiding<br>
contamination of the environment, this container also has<br>
feeding means and a temperature regulator, the recommended<br>
interval temperature for the smelting process and part of<br>
combustion of the plastic is approximately 65°C to 90°C,<br>
preferably 70°C and 80°C during a time period of 3 to 20<br>
minutes, preferably 3 to 5 minutes, C) add a predetermined<br>
amount of solid petroleum known as curved tar from waste, the<br>
amount varies from approximately 0.1% to 30%, preferably 2%<br>
in proportion to the weight of the raw material of smelted<br>
polyethylene, and leave these materials to mix at the same<br>
temperature for 10 to 35 minutes; D) once the plastic and the<br>
tar have been perfectly mixed, the mixture is withdrawn from<br>
the container to be poured on a clean surface or in<br>
containers until it crystallizes at room temperature; F) once<br>
having crystallized, the substrate formed, which is brittle<br>
and therefore forms different sizes of grain, is removed from<br>
the surface or containers and is sieved, passing it through<br>
sieves of different sizes, which allows to obtain control of<br>
the diameter of the grain according to the requirements or<br>
intended use; G) The size of the crystal or grain may be from<br>
very fine to one inch, larger grains remaining in the sieve<br>
are collected to further be passed through a mill and be<br>
reduced in diameter, to be later sieved according to step F)<br>
above.<br>
2, The method according to claim 1, featured because the<br>
low-density polyethylene used is selected from any kind, as<br>
for example, disposable straws and glasses, bags, bottles,<br>
etc., collected from trash dumps as solid waste or from any<br>
other industrial source.<br>
3. The method according to claim 1, featured because in<br>
step B) , when heating the polyethylene one is able to break<br>
the highly ramified chains that constitute the polymer,<br>
provoking their reorientation and rearrangement, forming new<br>
non-ramified chains with new properties.<br>
4. The method according to claim 1, featured because<br>
in step C) , the tar added contributes to the formation of a<br>
larger and more flexible polymeric molecule.<br>
5. A plastic sand based on recycled plastic featured<br>
because it contains recycled low-density polyethylene and<br>
petroleum in solid form from 0.1% up to 30%, preferably t%,<br>
all of which must be adjusted to 100%.<br>
6. A plastic sand according to claim 5, featured<br>
because the solid petroleum is selected from curved waste<br>
tar.<br>
7. A plastic sand according to claim 5, featured because<br>
the low-density polyethylene is selected from all kind of<br>
low-density polyethylene, for example, straws, disposable<br>
glasses, bags, bottles, etc., collected from trash dumps as<br>
solid waste or from any other industrial source.<br>
8. The use of plastic sand in claim 5 obtained from the<br>
process of claim 1 to manufacture bricks, mortar, concrete,<br>
and in construction.<br></td>
