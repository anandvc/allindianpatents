				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to processes and apparatus for the<br>
removal of nitrogen oxides or "NOX" (principally nitric oxide (NO) and<br>
nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) from exhaust gases and the like. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to processes and apparatus for<br>
reducing NOX selectively from exhaust gases produced during petroleum<br>
refining, petrochemical production and also to industrial processes<br>
producing exhaust gases containing NOX.<br>
Carbonaceous fuels are burned in internal combustion engines and<br>
in a wide variety of industrial process (i.e. boilers, furnaces, heaters and<br>
incinerators, petroleum refining, petrochemical production, and the like).<br>
Excess air frequently is used to complete the oxidation of combustion<br>
byproducts such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons and soot. Free<br>
radicals of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) combine chemically to form<br>
NOX, primarily NO, at high combustion temperatures. This thermal NOX<br>
tends to form even when nitrogen is not present in the fuel. Combustion<br>
modifications which decrease the formation of thermal NOX generally are<br>
limited by the generation of objectionable byproducts or deteriorating<br>
flame properties.<br>
When discharged to the air, NO emissions oxidize to form NO2,<br>
which in the presence of sunlight reacts with volatile organic compounds<br>
to form ground level ozone, eye irritants and photochemical smog.<br>
Despite advancements in fuel and combustion technology, ground level<br>
ozone concentrations still exceed federal guidelines in many urban<br>
regions. Under the Clean Air Act and its amendments, these ozone non-<br>
attainment areas must implement stringent NOX emissions regulations.<br>
Such regulations require low NOX emissions levels that are attained only<br>
by exhaust after-treatment. When an exhaust after-treatment system is<br>
applied to a refinery or petrochemical plant, it is particularly important to<br>
minimize any impact on the operation of the underlying refining or<br>
petrochemical process.<br>
Exhaust after-treatment techniques tend to reduce NOX using<br>
various chemical or catalytic methods. Such methods are known in the<br>
art and involve non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR), selective<br>
catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR5.<br>
Alternatively, NO may be oxidized to NO2 for removal by wet scrubbers.<br>
Such after-treatment methods typically require some type of reactant for<br>
removal of NOX emissions.<br>
Wet scrubbing of NO2 produces waste solutions that represent<br>
potential sources of water pollution. Wet scrubbers primarily are used for<br>
NOX emissions from nitric acid plants or for concurrent removal of NO2<br>
with sulfur dioxide (SO2). High costs and complexity generally limit<br>
scrubber technology to such special applications.<br>
The NSCR method typically uses unburned hydrocarbons and CO<br>
to reduce NOX emissions in the absence of O2. Fuel/air ratios must be<br>
controlled carefully to ensure low excess O2. Both reduction and<br>
oxidation catalysts are needed to remove emissions of CO and<br>
hydrocarbons while also reducing NOX. The cost of removing excess O,<br>
precludes practical applications of NSCR methods to many O2-containing<br>
exhaust gases.<br>
Chemical reactions on a solid catalyst surface of commercial SCR<br>
systems convert NOX to N2. These solid catalysts are selective for NOX<br>
removal and do not reduce emissions of CO and unburned hydrocarbons.<br>
Large catalyst volumes are normally needed to produce low levels of NOX.<br>
The catalyst activity depends on temperature and declines with use.<br>
Normal variations in catalyst activity are accommodated only by enlarging<br>
the volume of catalyst or iimiting the range of combustion operation.<br>
Catalysts may require replacement prematurely due to sintering or<br>
poisoning when exposed to high levels of temperature or exhaust<br>
contaminants.<br>
Commercial SCR systems primarily use ammonia (NH3) as the<br>
reductant. Excess NH3 needed to achieve low NOX levels tends to result<br>
in NH3 breakthrough as a byproduct emission. Even under normal<br>
operating conditions, SCR systems require a uniform distribution of NH3<br>
relative to NOX in the exhaust gas. NOX emissions, however, are<br>
frequently distributed nonuniformly, so low leveis of both NOX and NH3<br>
breakthrough may be achieved only by controlling the distribution of<br>
injected NH3 or mixing the exhaust to a uniform NOX level.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly stated, the invention in a preferred form is a method for<br>
removing pollutants from flue gas generated by a plant having one or<br>
more burners located at an inlet end of a vertically extending stack, the<br>
flue gas being discharged through an outlet end of the stack. The<br>
pollutants are removed by an emission treatment system which includes<br>
a major component module and inlet and outlet ductwork providing fluid<br>
communications between the stack and the major component module.<br>
The major component module includes an SCR segment, a heat<br>
exchanger segment, and an ID fan, the SCR segment having at least one<br>
catalyst unit composed of materials for selectively catalyzing at least one<br>
pollutant. The method comprises the steps of drawing the flue gas from<br>
the stack and through the major component module with the ID fan,<br>
removing the pollutant from the flue gas with the SCR segment to<br>
produce a clean flue gas, and discharging the clean flue gas to the stack<br>
with the ID fan.<br>
When the pollutant to be removed is NOX, the emission treatment<br>
system also includes an ammonia addition subsystem which is in fluid<br>
communication with the inlet ductwork, and at least one catalyst unit is<br>
composed of materials for selectively catalyzing NOX. In addition, the<br>
method also comprises the step of mixing ammonia vapor with the flue<br>
gas upstream of the SCR segment. The ammonia vapor is mixed with the<br>
flue gas by injecting the ammonia vapor into the inlet ductwork and<br>
mixing the ammonia vapor with the flue gas over the length of the inlet<br>
ductwork. The mixing is facilitated by creating turbulence in the flue gas<br>
by changing the direction of flue gas flow from a vertical direction in the<br>
stack to a horizontal direction in the inlet ductwork.<br>
The ammonia addition subsystem includes a source of ammonia<br>
vapor, an ammonia injection grid disposed in the inlet ductwork, an<br>
ammonia vapor pipe providing fluid communication between the source<br>
of ammonia vapor and the ammonia injection grid, and a throttle valve<br>
disposed in the ammonia vapor pipe. The rate of ammonia addition is<br>
controlled by regulating the throttle valve with an ammonia addition<br>
controller. In a first control scheme, the throttle valve is regulated on the<br>
basis of the flue gas flow rate and the level of NOX entering and exiting<br>
the emission treatment system. In a second control scheme, the throttle<br>
valve is regulated on the basis of ammonia carry-over. In a third control<br>
scheme, the throttle vaive is regulated on the basis of the fuel flow rate<br>
and the composition of the fuel.<br>
The flow rate of the flue gas through the major component<br>
module is controlled by regulating the pressure decrease across the ID fan<br>
with a controller. A damper controlling the pressure decrease across the<br>
ID fan is regulated on the basis of the ID fan supply and discharge<br>
pressures and the differential pressures across the SCR and heat<br>
exchange segments.<br>
The plant also has a boiler and a feed pump circulating feedwater<br>
to the boiler, the flow of the feedwater through the heat exchange<br>
segment is controlled by regulating the speed of the feed pump with a<br>
pump speed controller. The feed pump is regulated on the basis of the<br>
feedwater temperature and pressure in the feed and return lines.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method of removing<br>
pollutants from flue gas which is easily adapted to the removal of many<br>
pollutants.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a method of<br>
removing pollutants from flue gas which is relatively simple to perform.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the drawings and specification.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
As concern for the environment grows, greater efforts are being<br>
undertaken to reduce emissions of known pollutants, such as particulate<br>
matter, NOX, SOX, mercury, etc, by the promulgation of more stringent<br>
control requirements. For the refinery and petrochemical industries, the<br>
first of these more stringent requirements focuses on NOX reduction.<br>
With reference to the drawings wherein like numerals represent<br>
like parts throughout the several figures, an emission treatment system<br>
10 in accordance with the present invention reduces NOX by SCR<br>
technology, provides for future emissions control of other pollutants, and<br>
is a stand-alone system that may be installed on the ground along side<br>
the existing equipment, or on legs along side the existing equipment, or<br>
on top of the existing equipment, thereby reducing the downtime of the<br>
refinery or petrochemical production equipment.<br>
The emission treatment system 10 may be utilized with most<br>
refinery and petrochemical production systems. However, for descriptive<br>
purposes, the system 10 is described herein installed with an ethylene-<br>
cracking furnace 12 (Figure 2). Fuel is fired by burners 14 located at the<br>
bottom or side of the furnace 1 2 generating high temperature gas and<br>
NOX. The "cracking" of hydrocarbon molecules into simpler molecules<br>
occurs in a coil 1 6 in this highest temperature zone. As the furnace<br>
gases pass upward through the furnace, heat is recovered from the flue<br>
gas by a series of additional coils 18 which contain either cracking<br>
feedstock for preheating or water/steam for use in this process or other<br>
processes. Typically, ethylene-cracking furnaces 12 have one or more<br>
induced draft (ID) fans 20 located on top of the heater connected by a<br>
vertical stack 22. Ethylene-cracking furnaces 12 typically run for several<br>
years between significant outages and are a key provider of feedstock for<br>
other processes within the refinery or petrochemical plant. Therefore, the<br>
downtime to install an SCR is severely limited and costly to the owner.<br>
SCR NOX removal processes are typically most efficient at<br>
temperatures of 500 - 750° F. Gases at this temperature are typically<br>
found just upstream of the ethylene-cracking furnace boiler feedwater<br>
heating coil 24 and the ID fan 20. One conventional approach for an SCR<br>
retrofit is to shut down the furnace 12, cut into the stack-22 at the<br>
appropriate location, lift up the downstream sections and install the SCR.<br>
This is much too time consuming to be an economically attractive<br>
solution.<br>
The subject emission treatment system 10 includes a stand-alone,<br>
modular major component module 26, typically at ground level, that<br>
includes an SCR segment 28, a boiler feedwater heat exchange segment<br>
30, and an ID fan 32. By "abandoning" the stack ID fan 20 and the<br>
ethylene-cracking furnace boiler feedwater heating coil 24 installed in the<br>
stack 22, the emission treatment system 10 is installed without requiring<br>
any major modifications to the ethylene-cracking furnace 1 2. This allows<br>
installation of the emission treatment system 10 without significantly-<br>
interrupting use of the ethylene-cracking furnace 12. The major<br>
component module 26 may also be placed on legs above the ground, or<br>
even on top of the existing furnace 12, as individual application<br>
circumstances may require. The new, system ID fan 32 is sized to<br>
provide for the increased draft requirements of the emission treatment<br>
system 10, principally for the SCR segment 28. The boiler feedwater<br>
 heat exchange segment 30 may have higher heat recovery efficiency than<br>
the stack boiler feedwater heating coil 24, depending on the design and<br>
materials of the stack boiler feedwater heating coil 24, providing an<br>
improvement in overall cycle efficiency and/or reduced fuel costs. The<br>
stand-alone nature of the system 10 allows for future modification of the<br>
 SCR segment 28 or the addition of additional segments for emissions<br>
control of other pollutants.<br>
With further reference to Figure 2, the emission treatment system<br>
10 also includes a blanking member 34 or bypass flapper 34" mounted<br>
within the vertical stack 22, just upstream of the ethylene-cracking<br>
furnace boiler feedwater heating coil 24. The blanking member 34 is<br>
installed across the stack 22 to permanently cutoff all flow through the<br>
ethylene-cracking furnace boiler feedwater heating coil 24 and the stack<br>
ID fan 20. The bypass flapper 34" is installed across the stack 22 to<br>
selectively cutoff all flow through the ethylene-cracking furnace boiler<br>
feedwater heating coil 24 and the stack ID fan 20. Flue gas take-off and<br>
return openings 36, 38 are formed in the stack 22 just upstream of the<br>
blanking member/bypass flapper 34, 34" and just downstream of the<br>
stack ID fan 2O respectively. Inlet ductwork 40 connected to flue gas<br>
take-off opening 36 and an inlet transition piece 42 in the upper end<br>
portion of the major component module 26 and outlet ductwork 44<br>
connected to flue gas return opening 38 and the outlet of system ID fan<br>
32 provide fluid communication between the stack 22 and the major<br>
component module 26. The inlet ductwork 40 includes a horizontal run<br>
46 and a vertical run 48, each having a nominal length of thirty (30) feet.<br>
Dynamic vanes 50 may be positioned in the elbow 52 between horizontal<br>
run 46 and vertical run 48 to reduce the pressure drop through the<br>
elbow (Figure 4).<br>
Conventional utility boiler applications having SCR systems<br>
generally use ammonia (NH3) as a reductant and include an ammonia<br>
addition system which provides a mixture of ammonia diluted with air or<br>
flue gas to uniformly distribute the ammonia across the face of the SCR<br>
catalyst, which is located a relatively short distance downstream of the<br>
injector. Accordingly, a conventional ammonia addition system consists<br>
of a control system, a source of ammonia (NH3) vapor, a static mixer, at<br>
least one blower, and an injector which includes multiple spray lines, each<br>
having multiple spray nozzles. The ammonia vapor source injects<br>
ammonia vapor into the static mixer. Dilution air is blown by the<br>
blower(s) into the static mixer to dilute the ammonia vapor and propel the<br>
diluted ammonia vapor out of the ammonia addition subsystem via the<br>
injector nozzles.<br>
The subject emission treatment system 10 includes an ammonia<br>
addition subsystem 54 which takes advantage of the relatively long<br>
lengths of the horizontal and vertical runs 46, 48 to provide for proper<br>
mixing of the ammonia vapor in the flue gas stream. The ammonia<br>
addition subsystem 54 does not include dilution air blowers, blower<br>
controls, and the larger diameter diluted ammonia ducting. The ammonia<br>
addition subsystem 54 consists of only three major components, a<br>
controller 56, a source of ammonia vapor 58, and an ammonia injection<br>
grid (AIG) 60. Only a small diameter ammonia vapor pipe 62 is needed.<br>
As discussed in greater detail below, the AIG 60 is preferably installed<br>
within ten (10) feet of the stack 22. A static mixer/diffuser 64 may be<br>
positioned in the horizontal run 46 in the event that the AIG 60 must be<br>
located at a significant distance from the stack 22 or to simply provide<br>
additional assurance of complete mixing of the ammonia vapor and the<br>
flue gas. The inlet transition piece 42 at the entrance to the major<br>
components module 26 distributes the ammonia vapor/flue gas mixture<br>
evenly across the inlet to the downstream SCR segment 28.<br>
In addition, the AIG 60 is much simpler than the injectors of<br>
conventional systems, having a much reduced number of spray lines and<br>
no nozzles, the ammonia vapor being sprayed through openings in the<br>
sidewall of the spray line. The exact number of spray lines and openings<br>
is dependent on the installation specific parameters, such as the flue gas<br>
flow rate and the required rate of ammonia addition. The AIG 60 is<br>
preferably located within ten feet of the stack 22 to take advantage of<br>
the turbulence within the flue gas steam created by the "bend" formed by<br>
the blanking member/bypass flapper 34, 34" and opening 36. The<br>
turbulence further ensures that the ammonia vapor is thoroughly mixed<br>
with the flue gas. Analysis has shown that sufficient ammonia/flue gas<br>
mixing occurs even if the AIG 60 is located in horizontal run 46 within<br>
ten (10) feet of the stack 22. It is possible that additional analysis would<br>
show that sufficient mixing will also occur at greater distances from the<br>
stack 22. The motive force for injecting the ammonia vapor into the flue<br>
gas stream may provided by the vapor pressure of the ammonia in the<br>
ammonia source 58. As shown in Table 1, the pressure of the ammonia<br>
vapor is sufficient over a full range of expected ambient temperatures to<br>
provide the required motive force.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 3, the SCR segment 28 contains catalyst<br>
units 66 which remove NOX. The catalyst units 66 are conventional<br>
units, each having nominal dimensions of three feet - three inches by six<br>
feet - six inches (3.25" x 6.5"). As shown in Figure 3, upper and lower<br>
groups 68, 70 of catalyst units 66, each including one to eight units 66,<br>
may be positioned within the SCR segment housing 72. Intermediate<br>
support rails 74 carry the weight of the upper group 68 of catalyst units<br>
66, while allowing the flue gas/ammonia vapor mixture to access all of<br>
the catalyst units 66 contained within the SCR segment housing 72. If<br>
only three catalyst units 66 are required to remove the NOX, a blanking<br>
mechanism 76 may be included in the SCR segment 28 to selectively<br>
block half of the catalyst units 66. Such a blanking mechanism 76 may<br>
comprise one or more flappers 77, 77" which each have a single side<br>
edge pivotally mounted to opposite inside surfaces of the housing 72.<br>
Initially, flapper 77 is in the vertical, open position (allowing flow through<br>
the catalyst units 66 disposed under flapper 77) and flapper 77" is in the<br>
horizontal, closed position (preventing flow through the catalyst units<br>
disposed under flapper 77"). As the catalyst units 66 disposed under<br>
flapper 77 become depleted, flapper 77" is repositioned to the vertical,<br>
open position (allowing flow through the catalyst units 66 disposed under<br>
flapper 77"). Flapper 77 may be repositioned to the closed position.<br>
Alternatively, flapper 77 may remain in the open position, to allow use of<br>
any residual NOX removal capability of the catalyst units 66 disposed<br>
thereunder. !f it is expected that flapper 77 will never be positioned in<br>
the close position, only flapper 77" need be installed.<br>
Alternatively, the SCR segment 28 may contain upper and lower<br>
groups 68, 70 of two catalyst units 66 or a single layer of one to eight<br>
catalyst units 66, depending on the amount of NOX which must be<br>
removed and other application specific considerations, if space permits,<br>
and if other pollutants (e.g. CO, hydrocarbons, etc.) must be removed<br>
from the flue gas, catalyst units 78 targeting such other pollutants or<br>
catalyst units 80 removing N0x plus such other pollutants may be<br>
included in the SCR segment 28. Alternatively, the housing 82 located<br>
above the SCR segment 28 may be converted into a second SCR<br>
segment to provide for removing additional NOX and/or other pollutants.<br>
As noted above, the emission treatment system 10 may be<br>
installed without significantly interrupting use of the ethylene-cracking<br>
furnace 1 2 by eliminating the need to make major modifications to the<br>
stack 22. The impact on the plant is further reduced by the modular<br>
construction of the major component module 26. The major component<br>
module 26 includes upper, middle and lower sub-modules 84, 85, 86.<br>
The lower sub-module 86 includes the ID fan 32, an outlet transition<br>
piece 88, and power and controls boxes (not shown), all of which are<br>
mounted on a base plate 90. The middle sub-module 85 includes the<br>
heat exchange segment 30. The upper sub-module 84 includes the SCR<br>
segment 28 and the inlet transition piece 42. Each of the sub-modules<br>
84, 85, 86 is sized to fit on a conventional flat-bed tractor trailer.<br>
With reference to Figures 5-8, installation of the emission<br>
treatment system 10 is a relatively simple process, providing for a low<br>
on-site construction time and minimal disruption of normal refinery<br>
activities. A number of activities are required take place in preparation<br>
92 for the arrival of the major component module 26. The installation<br>
site of the major component module 26 must be selected 94 and an<br>
appropriate foundation installed 96 at such installation site. The location<br>
of the flue gas take-off and return openings 36, 38 must be determined<br>
98. The heat exchanger take-off and return must be identified 100.<br>
Sources for the ammonia vapor, electric power, and control air (if needed)<br>
must be identified 102, 104, 106. Finally, all control system interfaces<br>
must be identified 108. It should be appreciated that the majority of<br>
these tasks may be conducted in parallel.<br>
Initial installation 110 begins by setting 112 the lower sub-<br>
module 86 on the foundation with a crane and securing 114 the base<br>
plate 90 to the foundation with anchor bolts (not shown). The crane is<br>
then used to set 115 the middle sub-module 85 on top of lower sub-<br>
module 86, set 116 the upper sub-module 84 on top of middle sub-<br>
module 85 and the three sub-modules 84, 86 are welded 118 together.<br>
The crane is then used to set 120 the inlet and outlet ductwork 40, 44<br>
in place, along with its appropriate support structure, and the ductwork<br>
40, 44 is connected to inlet transition piece 42 and outlet transition<br>
piece, respectively. The ammonia injection grid (AIG) 60 is installed 121,<br>
including connection to the ammonia vapor source 58. Connecting<br>
flanges 122 are welded 124 to the stack 22 at the location where the<br>
fiue gas take-off and return openings 36, 38 will be cut, but openings 36<br>
and 38 are not cut at this time. Interconnecting piping 126 is run 128<br>
between the new heat exchanger segment 30 and the heat exchanger<br>
take-off and return and connected to heat exchanger segment 30. Using<br>
the crane again, platforms and ladders 130 are mounted 132 to the major<br>
components module 26. The instrumentation is installed and the<br>
ammonia vapor feed, electric power, control, and instrumentation<br>
connections are installed 134 with the corresponding system devices.<br>
The catalyst units 66 are loaded 136 in the SCR segment 28.<br>
Commissioning and pre-start procedures are conducted 138. During a<br>
scheduled tie-in outage 140, the flue gas take-off and return openings<br>
36, 38 are cut 142, the blank/damper 34, 34* is installed 144 within the<br>
stack 22, and the heat exchanger feed and return lines 126 are<br>
connected 146 to the heat exchanger segment 30 and the take-off and<br>
the return. Finally, the ethylene-cracking furnace 12 and emission<br>
treatment system 10 are started-up 1 50.<br>
As discussed above, the motive force for injecting the ammonia<br>
vapor into the flue gas stream is provided by the vapor pressure of the<br>
ammonia in the ammonia source 58. With reference to Figure 9, a<br>
throttle valve 152 in ammonia vapor pipe 62 controls the flow of the<br>
ammonia vapor into the AIG 60. Preferably, valve 1 52 is controlled by<br>
the controller 56 on the basis of the flue gas flow rate, the amount of<br>
NOX entering the emission treatment system 1 0, and the amount of NOX<br>
exiting the emission treatment system 10. A flow sensor 154 positioned<br>
upstream of AIG 60 and NOX detectors 156, 158 located upstream of<br>
AIG 60 and at the outlet of fan 32, respectively, provide the necessary<br>
inputs to controller 56 to control ammonia addition in this manner.<br>
Alternatively, ammonia addition may be controlled on the basis of<br>
ammonia carry-over or slip. For control in this manner, an ammonia<br>
sensor 1 60 may be positioned at the outlet of fan 32. In still another<br>
alternative, ammonia addition may be controlled on the basis of the fuel<br>
flow to the burners 14 and the composition of such fuel.<br>
Interconnections 162 may be provided between controller 56 and the fuel<br>
control 164 of the furnace 12 to control in this manner. Ammonia vapor<br>
flow may be monitored by pressure, temperature and flow detectors 1 66,<br>
168, 170 disposed in ammonia vapor pipe 62.<br>
With reference to Figure 10, proper flow of the flue gas through<br>
the emission treatment system 10 is maintained by a controller 1 72<br>
which controls the position of a damper 173 in the inlet of fan 32 onthe<br>
basis of the fan supply pressure, the fan discharge pressure, the<br>
differential pressure across SCR 28, and the differential pressure across<br>
heat exchanger 30. Pressure detectors 1 74, 1 76 at the inlet and outlet<br>
of fan 32, respectively, and differential pressure detectors 178, 180 on<br>
SCR 28 and heat exchanger 30, respectively, provide necessary inputs<br>
to controller 172. The temperature of the flue gas stream may be<br>
monitored by a temperature detector 1 82 positioned upstream of AIG 60<br>
(Figure 9).<br>
With reference to Figure 1 1, a feed pump 184 in the heat<br>
exchanger feed and return lines 126 controls the flow of the boiler<br>
feedwater through heat exchanger 30. The speed of pump 184 is<br>
controlled by a controller 186 on the basis of the boiler feedwater<br>
pressure and temperature. Pressure sensors 188 and temperature<br>
sensors 190 positioned in the boiler feedwater inlet and outlet of the heat<br>
exchanger 30 provide the necessary inputs to controller 56 to feedwater<br>
flow in this manner. Temperature detectors 192, 194 in the flue gas<br>
stream upstream and downstream of heat exchanger 30, respectively,<br>
allow the efficiency of the heat exchanger 30 to be monitored.<br>
The emission treatment system 10 described above is intended<br>
for use in treating flue gas having little or no sulfur. If sulfur is present<br>
or expected to be present in the flue gas, such sulfur must be removed<br>
before the flue gas enters the SCR segment 28. The major components<br>
module 26 is also described above as a vertical system. The benefit of<br>
such a vertical system is that it reduces the size of the foot print required<br>
for installing the module 26. However, if the foot print size is not a<br>
concern, the major components module 26 may be installed as a<br>
horizontal system, thereby providing easier access to the SCR and heat<br>
exchange segments 28, 30.<br>
Many ethylene-cracking furnaces 12 have relied on "first<br>
generation" low NOX burners to reduce NOX emissions to levels which<br>
were acceptable under the old emissions standards. However, newer<br>
"second generation" low NOX burners must be used to attain levels which<br>
are acceptable under the new emissions standards. The second<br>
generation low NOX burners adversely affect the efficiency of the furnace<br>
1 2 due to the different flame shape and heat distribution produced by<br>
such burners, compared to first generation low NOX burners. It should be<br>
appreciated that the use of the emission treatment system 10 allows the<br>
continued use of the first generation low NOX burners, thereby<br>
maintaining the ethylene-cracking furnace 1 2 at peak efficiency. In<br>
addition, burner control systems may be used which optimize burner<br>
efficiency.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been shown and described,<br>
various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to<br>
be understood that the present invention has been described by way of<br>
illustration and not limitation.<br>
