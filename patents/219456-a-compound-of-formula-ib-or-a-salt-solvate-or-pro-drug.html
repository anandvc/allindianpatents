COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND OF FORMULA (IB) OR A SALT, SOLVATE<br>
OR PRO-DRUG"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a compound of formula (lb) of a salt, solvate or pro-         drug.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of a group of benzamide compounds in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment or prevention of a disease or medical 5  condition mediated through glucokinase (GLK), leading to a decreased glucose threshold for insulin secretion. In addition the compounds are predicted to lower blood glucose by increasing hepatic glucose uptake. Such compounds may have utility in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said benzamide compound, a sub-group of novel compounds of said benzamide compounds , 10  and the use of such a compound in the conditions described above.<br>
In the pancreatic -cell and liver parenchymal cells the main plasma membrane glucose transporter is GLUT2. Under physiological glucose concentrations the rate at which GLUT2 transports glucose across the membrane is not rate limiting to the overall rate of<br>
        glucose uptake in these cells. The rate of glucose uptake is limited .by the rate of<br>
15   phosphorylation of glucose to gIucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) which is catalysed by glucokinase (GLK)[1]. GLK has a high (6-1 OmM) Km for glucose and is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of G-6-P [1]. GLK expression is limited to a few tissues and cell types, most notably pancreatic (3-cells and liver cells (hepatocytes) [1]. In these cells GLK activity is rate limiting for glucose utilisation and therefore regulates the extent of glucose induced insulin 20  secretion and hepatic glycogen synthesis. These processes are critical in the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis and both are dysfunctional in diabetes [2],<br>
In one sub-type of diabetes. Type 2 maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY-2), the diabetes is caused by GLK loss of function mutations [3, 4]. Hyperglycaemia in MODY-2 patients results from defective glucose utilisation in both the pancreas and liver [5]. Defective 25  glucose utilisation in the pancreas of MODY-2 patients results in a raised threshold for glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Conversely, rare activating mutations of GLK reduce this threshold resulting in familial hyperinsulinism {6, 7].  In addition to the reduced GLK activity observed in MODY-2 diabetics, hepatic glucokinase activity is also decreased in type 2 diabetics [8]. Importantly, global or liver selective overexpression of GLK prevents or 30  reverses the development of the diabetic phenotype in both dietary and genetic models of the disease [9-12]. Moreover, acute treatment of type 2 diabetics with fructose improves glucose folerance through stimulation of hepatic glucose utilisation [13]. This effect is believed to be<br><br>
mediated through a fructose induced increase in cytosolic GLK activity in the hepatocyte by       the mechanism described below [13].<br>
Hepatic GLK activity is inhibited through association with GLK regulatory protein (GLKRP). The GLK/GLKRP complex is stabilised by fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) binding to 5   the GLKRP and destabilised by displacement of this sugar phosphate by fructose-1-phosphate (F1P). F1P is generated by fructokinase mediated phosphorylation of dietary fructose. Consequently, GLK/GLKRP complex integrity and hepatic GLK activity is regulated in a nutritionally dependent manner as F6P is elevated in the post-absorptive state whereas F1P predominates in the post-prandial state. In contrast to the hepatocyte, the pancreatic -cell 10  expresses GLK in the absence of GLKRP. Therefore, -cell GLK activity is regulated<br>
exclusively by the availability of its substrate, glucose. Small molecules may activate GLK either directly or through destabilising the GLK/GLKRP complex. The former class of compounds are predicted to stimulate glucose utilisation in both the liver and the pancreas whereas the latter are predicted to act exclusively in the liver. However, compounds with 15   either profile are predicted to be of therapeutic benefit in treating Type 2 diabetes as this disease is characterised by defective glucose utilisation in both tissues.<br>
GLK and GLKRP and the KATP channel are expressed in neurones of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that is important in the regulation of energy balance and the control of food intake [14-18]. These neurones have been shown to express orectic and 20   anorectic neuropeptides [15, 19, 20] and have been assumed to be the glucose-sensing<br>
neurones within the hypothalamus that are either inhibited or excited by changes in ambient glucose concentrations [17, 19, 21, 22]. The ability of these neurones to sense changes in glucose levels is defective in a variety of genetic and experimentally induced models of obesity [23-28]. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of glucose analogues, that are 25   competitive inhibitors of glucokinase, stimulate food intake in lean rats [29, 30]. In contrast, icv infusion of glucose suppresses feeding [31]. Thus, small molecule activators of GLK may decrease food intake and weight gain through central effects on GLK. Therefore, GLK activators may be of therapeutic use in treating eating disorders, including obesity, in addition to diabetes.   The hypothalamic effects will be additive or synergistic to the effects of the same 30   compounds acting in the liver and/or pancreas in normalising glucose homeostasis, for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Thus the GLK/GLKRP system can be described as a potential "Diabesity" target (of benefit in both Diabetes and Obesity).<br><br>
InWO0058293  and W00 l/44216 (Roche), a series of benzylcarbamoyl compounds<br>
are described as glucokinase activators. The mechanism by which such compounds activate<br>
GLK is assessed by measuring the direct effect of such compounds in an assay in which GLK<br>
activity is linked to NADH production, which in turn is measured optically - see details of the<br>
5   in vitro assay described in Example A. Compounds of the present invention may activate GLK<br>
directly or may activate GLK by inhibiting the interaction of GLKRP with GLK. The latter<br>
mechanism offers an important advantage over direct activators of GLK in that they will not<br>
cause the severe hypoglycaemic episodes predicted after direct stimulation. Many compounds<br>
of the present invention may show favourable selectivity compared to known GLK activators.<br>

BIOLOGICAL<br>
Tests:<br>
The biological effects of the compounds of formula (I) or (IA) or (IB) may be tested in the<br>
following way:<br>
(1) Enzymatic activity of GLK may be measured by incubating GLK, ATP and glucose. The rate of product formation may be determined by coupling the assay to a G-6-P dehydrogenase, NADP/NADPH system and measuring the increase in optical density at 340nm (Matschinsky et al 1993).<br>
(2) A GLK/GLKRP binding assay for measuring the binding interactions between GLK and GLKRP. The method may be used to identify compounds which modulate GLK by modulating the interaction between GLK and GLKRP. GLKRP and GLK are incubated with an inhibitory concentration of F-6-P, optionally in the presence of test compound, and the extent of interaction between GLK and GLKRP is measured.  Compounds which either displace F-6-P or in some other way reduce the GLK/GLKRP interaction will be detected by a decrease in the amount of GLK/GLKRP complex formed. Compounds which promote F-6-P binding or in some other way enhance the GLK/GLKRP interaction will be detected by an<br><br>
increase in the amount of GLK/OLKRP complex formed.   A specific example of such a 1     binding assay is described below<br>
GLK/GLKRP scintillation proximity assay<br>
5	The compounds A to S (described in Examples A to S) and 1 to 118 (described in<br>
Examples T to Y) were found to have an activity of at least 40% activity at 10 u.m when tested in the GLK/GLKRP scintillation proximity assay described below.<br>
Recombinant human GLK and GLKRP were used to develop a "mix and measure" 96 10   well SPA (scintillation proximity assay) as described in WO01/20327 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). GLK (Biotinylated) and GLKRP are incubated with streptavidin linked SPA beads (Amersham) in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of radiolabeled [3H]F-6-P (Amersham Custom Synthesis TRQ8689), giving a signal. Compounds which either displace the F-6-P or in some other way disrupt the GLK/ GLKRP 15   binding interaction will cause this signal to be lost.<br>
Binding assays were performed at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction mixtures contained 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2mM ATP, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT, recombinant biotinylated GLK ( 0.1 mg), recombinant GLKRP (0.1 mg), 0.05mCi [3H] F-6-P (Amersham) to give a final volume of 100ml. Following incubation, the extent of 20  GLK/GLKRP complex formation was determined by addition of-O.lmg/well avidin linked SPA beads (Amersham) and scintillation counting on a Packard TopCount NXT.<br>
(3) A F-6-P / GLKRP binding assay for measuring the binding interaction between GLKRP and F-6-P. This method may be used to provide further information on the<br>
25   mechanism of action of the compounds. Compounds identified in the GLK/GLKRP binding assay may modulate the interaction of GLK and GLKRP either by displacing F-6-P or by modifying the GLK/GLKRP interaction in some other way. For example, protein-protein interactions are generally known to occur by interactions through multiple binding sites. It is thus possible that a compound which modifies the interaction between GLK and GLKRP<br>
30   could act by binding to one or more of several different binding sites.<br>
The F-6-P / GLKRP binding assay identifies only those compounds which modulate the interaction of GLK and GLKRP by displacing F-6-P from its binding site on GLKRP.<br><br>
GLKRP is incubated with test compound and an inhibitory concentration of F-6-P, in the absence of GLK, and the extent of interaction between F-6-P and GLKRP is measured. Compounds which displace the binding of F-6-P to GLKRP may be detected by a change in the amount of GLKRP/F-6-P complex formed. A specific example of such a binding assay is 5   described below<br>
F-6-PI GLKRP scintillation proximity assay<br>
Recombinant human GLKRP was used to develop a "mix and measure" 96 well scintillation proximity assay ) as described in WOO 1/20327 (the contents of which are<br>
10   incorporated herein by reference). FLAG-tagged GLKRP is incubated with protein A coated SPA beads (Amersham) and an anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of radiolabeled [3H]F-6-P. A signal is generated. Compounds which displace the F-6-P will cause this signal to be lost. A combination of this assay and the GLK/GLKRP binding assay will allow the observer to identify compounds which disrupt the GLK/GLKRP<br>
15   binding interaction by displacing F-6-P.<br>
Binding assays were performed at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction mixtures contained 50mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 2mM ATP, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT, recombinant FLAG tagged GLKRP (0.1 mg), Anti-Flag M2 Antibody (0.2mg) (IBI Kodak), 0.05mCi [3H] F-6-P (Amersham) to give a final volume of 100ml. Following incubation, the 20  extent of F-6-P/GLKRP complex formation was determined by addition of O.lmg/well protein A linked SPA beads (Amersham) and scintillation counting on a Packard TopCount NXT.<br>
Production of recombinant GLK and GLKRP:<br>
25   Preparation ofmRNA<br>
Human liver total mRNA was prepared by polytron homogenisation in 4M guanidine<br>
isothiocyanate, 2.5mM citrate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, lOOmM b-mercaptoethanol, followed by<br>
centrifugation through 5.7M CsCl, 25mM sodium acetate at 135,000g (max) as described in<br>
Sambrook J, Fntsch EF &amp; Maniatis T, 1989.<br>
30	Poly A+ mRNA was prepared directly using a FastTrack™ mRNA isolation kit<br>
(Invitrogen).<br><br>
PCR amplification of GLK and GLKRP cDNA sequences<br>
Human GLK and GLKRP cDNA was obtained by PCR from human hepatic mRNA using established techniques described in Sambrook, Fritsch &amp; Maniatis, 1989. PCR primers were designed according to the GLK and GLKRP cDNA sequences shown in Tanizawa et al 5   1991 and Bonthron, D.T. et al 1994 (later corrected in Warner, J.P. 1995).<br>
Cloning in Bluescript II vectors<br>
GLK and GLKRP cDNA was cloned in E. coli using pBluescript II, (Short et a] 1998) a recombinant cloning vector system similar to that employed by Yanisch-Perron C et al 10  (1985), comprising a colEI-based replicon bearing a polylinker DNA fragment containing multiple unique restriction sites, flanked by bacteriophage T3 and T7 promoter sequences; a filamentous phage origin of replication and an ampicillin drug resistance marker gene.<br>
Transfo nn at ion s<br>
15	E. Coli transformations were generally carried out by electroporation. 400 ml cultures<br>
of strains DH5a or BL21(DE3) were grown in L-broth to an OD 600 of 0.5 and harvested by centrifugation at 2,000g. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold deionised water, resuspended in 1ml 10% glycerol and stored in aliquots at -70 C. Ligation mixes were desalted using Millipore V series™ membranes (0.0025mm) pore size). 40ml of cells were<br>
20  incubated with 1ml of ligation mix or plasmid DNA on ice for 10 minutes in 0.2cm electroporation cuvettes, and then pulsed using a Gene Pulser™ apparatus (BioRad) at 0.5kVcm~', 250mF, 250 ?. Transformants were selected on L-agar supplemented with tetracyline at lOmg/ml or ampicillin at lOOmg/ml.<br>
25  Expression<br>
GLK was expressed from the vector pTB375NBSE in E.coii BL21 cells,, producing a recombinant protein containing a 6-His tag immediately adjacent to the N-terminal methionine. Alternatively, another suitable vector is pET21(+)DNA, Novagen, Cat number 697703. The 6-His tag was used to allow purification of the recombinant protein on a column 30  packed with nickel-nitnlotriacetic acid agarose purchased from Qiagen (cat no 30250).<br>
GLKRP was expressed from the vector pFLAG CTC (TBI Kodak) in E.coii BL21 cells, producing a recombinant protein containing a C-terminal FLAG tag. The protein was purified<br><br>
initially by DEAE Sepharose ion exchange followed by utilisation of the FLAG tag for final purification on an M2 anti-FLAG immunoaffinily column purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat no. A1205).<br>
5   Biotinylation of GLK:<br>
GLK was biotinylated by reaction with biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (biotin-NHS) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat no. B2643). Briefly, free amino groups of the target protein (GLK) are reacted with biotin-NHS at a defined molar ratio forming stable amide bonds resulting in a product containing covalently bound biotin. Excess, non-10  conjugated biotin-NHS is removed from the product by dialysis. Specifically, 7.5mg of GLK was added to 0.31mg of biotin-NHS in 4mL of 25mM HEPES pH7.3, 0.15M KC1, ImM dithiothreitol, ImM EDTA, ImM MgCl2 (buffer A). This reaction mixture was dialysed against lOOmL of buffer A containing a further 22mg of biotin-NHS. After 4hours excess biotin-NHS was removed by extensive dialysis against buffer A. 15<br>
