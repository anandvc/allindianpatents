				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention is related to polymeric compounds useful as a<br>
combined corrosion or hydrolysis inhibitor and surface modifier for metallic flake pigment. The invention also pertains to coating compositions containing the treated metallic pigments.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The use of metallic flake pigments, such as aluminum flake pigments,<br>
in decorative coatings to give the coating a metallic effect is widespread. The metallic effect is particularly popular with customers in the automotive market where "glamour finishes" are desired.<br>
[0003]	Automotive coatings can utilize a single, uniformly pigmented layer.<br>
Alternatively, they can have two distinct layers, i.e., a first, highly pigmented layer (basecoat) and a subsequently applied coating layer with little or no pigmentation (clearcoat). The two-layer coating is known in the industry as "basecoat/clearcoat". Basecoat/clearcoat coatings impart a high level of gloss and depth of color that can result in a particularly appealing look. Metallic flake pigments typically are incorporated into the basecoat composition.<br>
[0004]	Waterborne automotive paints are gaining widespread usage in the<br>
automotive industry due to concerns over organic solvent emissions during coating application and curing processes. However, waterborne paints have the disadvantage of using a medium that can be corrosive to metallic flake pigments. For example, hydrolysis of the metal pigments can occur in waterborne paints. Additionally, the pH of typical waterborne acrylic coating compositions can range from 8.0 to 9.0, and typical polyurethane coating compositions can have a pH typically ranging from 7.5 to 8.0. In a basic pH environment, the aluminum pigment can be oxidized. The oxidation is a form of corrosion that destroys the metallic pigmentation properties of the mirror-like particles. When a paint with oxidized metallic flake pigments is coated onto a substrate, the coating shows discoloration and diminished metallic effect.<br>
[0005]	Additionally, the hydrolysis or oxidation of the metallic surfaces in<br>
waterborne paints results in the evolution of hydrogen gas. The amount of hydrogen gas evolved is indicative of the amount of oxidation (i.e., corrosion) of the metallic <br>
pigment. The hydrogen gas can accumulate under pressure if the coating<br>
composition is stored in a closed container.<br>
[0006]	Hydrolysis of aluminum pigment in the presence of water can<br>
accelerate over time due to continuous contact with the basic pH environment of the<br>
coating composition. Coating compositions containing metal flake pigment are often<br>
stored for 6 months or more before application, which can result in significant<br>
corrosion of the pigment. If this corrosion remains unchecked the coating<br>
composition can be rendered unusable.<br>
[0007]	Considerable work has been done in the industry to treat or<br>
"passivate" metal pigment surfaces to prevent corrosion of the metal surface by water<br>
)n waterborne coating compositions. For example, it is known to apply a chrome<br>
coating over aluminum pigment surfaces to prevent the corrosion and hydrogen<br>
generation described above. However, chrome can be toxic and, therefore, special<br>
handling and disposal procedures are required for such chrome coated metallic<br>
pigment particles.<br>
[0008]	Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a coating composition<br>
that could be used to passivate metal pigments while reducing or eliminating<br>
altogether at least some of the problems associated with known passivation<br>
procedures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

suitable for passivating a metal surface. The polymer comprises (a) at least one nitro<br>
group, and/or pyridine group, and/or phenolic hydroxyl group; and (b) at least one<br>
group selected from a phosphorous-containing group and/or a carboxylic acid group,<br>
wherein the at least one phosphorous-containing group is selected from a phosphate,<br>
a phosphite, or a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate.<br>
[0010]	Also, the present invention provides a passivated metal pigment<br>
comprising at least one metal pigment particle and a passivating material formed over at least a portion of the at least one pigment particle, The passivating material can comprise a polymer comprising (a) at least one nitro group, and/or pyridine group, and/or phenolic hydroxyl group; and (b) at least one group selected from a phosphorous-containing group and/or a carboxylic acid group, wherein the at least one phosphorous-containing group is selected from a phosphate, a phosphite, or a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate.<br><br>
[0011]	In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a coating<br>
composition which comprises a diluent medium, a film-forming polymer, and at least one metal pigment particle at least partly treated with a passivating material. The passivating material can comprise a polymer comprising (a) at least one nitro group, and/or pyridine group, and/or phenolic hydroxyl group; and (b) at least one group selected from a phosphorous-containing group and/or a carboxylic acid group, wherein the at least one phosphorous-containing group is selected from a phosphate, a phosphite, or a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate.<br>
[0012]	Another embodiment provides a coating composition which comprises<br>
an aqueous diluent medium, a film-forming polymer, and at least one metal pigment particle at least partly treated with a passivating material. The passivating material can comprise a polymer comprising the reaction product of a diglycidyl ether of a polyhydric alcohol; a nitro group-containing compound selected from at least one of an alkyl, an aryl, and/or an alkyl aryl nitro group-containing compound; and a phosphorous group-containing compound comprising a phosphate group and/or a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate group.<br>
[0013]	A method of passivating a metal surface that comprises contacting the<br>
metal surface with a passivating material is also provided. The passivating material comprises a polymer comprising (a) at least one nitro group, and/or pyridine group, and/or phenolic hydroxyl group; and (b) at least one group selected from a phosphorous-containing group and/or a carboxylic acid group, wherein the at least one phosphorous-containing group is selected from a phosphate, a phosphite, or a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate.<br>

functionality include hydroxyethyl {rneth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, and allyl alcohol. Examples of suitable monomers with<br>
epoxy functionality include glycidyi (meth)acrylate. The addition polymer can be a<br>
hornopolymer of any of these hydroxyl or epoxy functional monomers or can be a<br>
copolymer of one or more of these hydroxyl or epoxy functional monomers and at<br>
least one other ethylenically unsaturated monomer that is not hydroxyl or epoxy<br>
functional. Examples of these other monomers include but are not limited to methyl<br>
(rneth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, styrene, and vinyl<br>
monomers such as styrene, vinyl toluene and vinyl acetate.<br>
[0019J	Examples of epoxy compounds that can be utilized include<br>
compounds as simple as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, and the like.<br>
[0020]	Examples of epoxy compounds that can be utilized also include the<br>
epoxy polyethers obtained by reacting an epihalohydrin (such as epichlorohydrin or epibromohydrin) with a polypheno! in the presence of an alkali. Suitable polyphenols include: 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane {i.e., bisphenol-A), 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)isobutane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxytertiarybutylpheny))propane, 4,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, bis(2-<br><br>

The polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols of various molecular weights can be produced, for example, by varying the mole ratio of epichlorohydrin to pofyphenol in known manner,<br>
[0021]	Examples of epoxy compounds that can be utilized also include the<br>
polyglycidyl ethers of mononuclear polyhydric phenols such as the polyglycidyl ethers of resorcinol, pyrogallol, hydroquinone, and pyrocatechol, as well as the monoglycidyl ethers of monohydric phenols such as phenylglycidyl ether, alpha-naphthylglycidyl ether, beta-naphthylgtycidyl ether, and the corresponding compounds bearing an alkyl substituent on the aromatic ring.<br>
[0022]	Further non-limiting examples of epoxy compounds that can be<br>
utilized also include the glycidyl ethers of aromatic alcohols, such as benzylgfycidyl<br>
ether and phenylglycidyi ether, or the polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols such<br>
as the reaction products of epichlorohydrin or dichlorohydrin with aliphatic and<br>
cycloaliphatic alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>

Other epoxy compounds that can be utflized include the monoglycidyl esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as glycidyl benzoate, glycidyl naphthoate as well as the monoglycidyl esters of substituted benzoic acid and naphthoic acids.<br>
[0024]	Addition polymerized resins containing epoxy groups can also be<br>
employed. Such materials can be produced by the addition polymerization of epoxy<br>
functional monomers such as giycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and ally! glycidyl<br>
ether typically in combination with polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated and/or<br>
vinyl monomers such as styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, alpha-ethyl styrene, vinyl<br>

acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate, and the like.<br>
[0025]	Alternatively, the polymeric backbone can comprise an acrylic,<br>
urethane, polyester, alkyd or epoxy polymer oroligomer. The polymeric backbone<br><br>
when synthesized can include thereon at least two isocyanate groups or capped or blocked isocyanate groups. This can be accomplished by either copolymerizing into the polymeric backbone a monomer with isocyanate or blocked isocyanate functionality, or by reacting one or more groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) with isocyanate or blocked isocyanate functionality onto the polymer. The reaction of the isocyanate or blocked isocyanate functionality with an isocyanate-reactive functionality of the first substituent or the second substituent can form the appropriate linking group.<br>
[0026]	Illustrative examples of isocyanate or blocked isocyanate functional<br>
urethane backbones include urethane polymers with terminal isocyanate or blocked<br>
isocyanate functionality. The urethane polymers can be synthesized by known<br>
techniques, such as bulk polymerization, such as solution polymerization, from<br>
polyisocyanates and polyfunctional compounds reactive with polyisocyanates,<br>
including, for example, polyols, polyarnines, and amino alcohols; with the proviso that<br>
the sum of equivalents of isocyanate and latent isocyanate groups used exceeds the<br>
equivalents used of polyfunctional compounds reactive with polyisocyanates. The<br>
polyisocyanate can be, for example, isophorone diisocyanate, p-phenylene<br>
diisocyanate, biphenyl 4, 4' diisocyanate, meta-xylylene diisocyanate, toluene<br>
diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-biphenylene diisocyanate, 1,4-tetramethylene<br>
diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyfhexane-1,6-<br>
diisocyanate, 1,3-bis-[2-((isocyanato)propyl]benzene (also known as<br>
fetramethylxylyldiisocyanate, TMXDI) methylene bis-(phenyl isocyanate), 1,5-<br>
naphthalene diisocyanate, bts-(isocyanatoethy) fumarate), methyfene bis-(4-<br>
cyclohexyf isocyanate), and biurets or isocyanurates of any of these.<br>
[0027]	The pofyfunctional compounds reactive with polyisocyanates can<br>
include any of diols, triols, or alcohols of higher functionality, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, neopentyl glyco), trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, polyester polyols, polyether polyols, and the like; polyarnines, such as ethylene diamine and diethylene triamine; or amino alcohols, such as diethanolamine and ethanolamine.<br>
[0028]	One of either the polyisocyanate or the polyfunctional compound<br>
reactive with polyisocyanate can have functionality (including blocked functionality) greater than two. The reactants can be apportioned so that the polyurethane copolymer has terminal isocyanate functionality.<br><br>
[0029]	Illustrative examples of isocyanate or blocked isocyanate functional<br>
acrylics are copolymers of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing an<br>
isocyanate or blocked isocyanate group. The copolymers can be prepared by using<br>
conventional techniques, such as free radical polymerization cationic polymerization,<br>
or anionic polymerization, in, for example, a batch or semi-batch process. For<br>
instance, the polymerization can be carried out by heating the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers in bulk or in organic solution in the presence of a free radical<br>
source, such as an organic peroxide or azo compound and, optionally, a chain<br>
transfer agent for a batch process; or, alternatively, the monomers and initiator(s) can<br>
be fed into the heated reactor at a controlled rate in a semi-batch process.<br>
[0030]	In one non-limiting embodiment, the first substituent can comprise a<br>
nitro (NO2) group. The nitro substituent can be formed by reacting a nitro-containing material with isocyanate groups on the polymer backbone. Examples of such materials useful for forming the substituents compatible with the above-mentioned requirements include any nitro-containing compound having an isocyanate reactive group, such as hydroxy, amino, mercapto or oxirane group. Useful nitro-containing compounds include alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl substituted compounds including an isocyanate reactive group. Exemplary, non-limiting nitro-containing compounds for purposes of the present invention include 2-methyl-2-nitro propanol, 2-nitro-1-propanol, 2-nitroethanol, 4-nitroaniline, 2-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-nitrothio phenol, 2-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 2-4-dinitrobenzoic acid, and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0031]	In another non-limiting embodiment, the first substituent can comprise<br>
at least one pyridine group and/or at least one phenolic hydroxyl group. Examples of<br>
materials suitable for forming the pyridine group include, but are not limited to, 2,6<br>
pyridine dimethanol, 2-pyridine propanol, 3-pyridine propanol, pyridine proprionic<br>
acid, isonicotonic acid, picolinic acid, dipicolinic acid, nicotinic acid, dinicotinic acid,<br>
cinchomeronic acid, isocinchomeronic acid, or mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
materials suitable for forming the phenolic hydroxyl group include, but are not limited<br>
to, gallic acid, allyl phenol, polyhydroxy phenols, such as resorcinol, catechol,<br>
phloroglucinol, pyrogallol, 1,2,4-benzene triol, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0032]	In one non-limiting embodiment, the second substituent comprises a<br>
phosphorous-containing group, such as a phosphate group, a non-nitrogen substituted phosphonate group, orthophosphoric acid, an organic ester of phosphoric acid, and/or a phosphite compound. For example, the phosphate compound can be<br><br>
of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,565,716. Organic phosphites are derivatives of phosphorous acid, rather than phosphoric acid used to produce organic phosphates. Exemplary organic phosphates are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,808,231.<br>
[0033]	Examples of phosphoric acid esters that can be used in the practice of<br>
the invention include mono- and di-C4-Ci8 alkyl esters, such as mono- and dibutylphosphate, mono and dipentyl phosphate, mono- and dihexylphosphate, mono- and diheptylphosphate, mono- and dioctylphosphate, mono- and dinonylphosphate, mono- and dihexadecylphosphate and mono- and dioctadecylphosphate; and aryl and aralkyl esters containing from 6 to 10 carbon atoms in the aromatic group, for example mono- and diphenylphosphate and mono-and dibenzylphosphate.<br>
[0034]	In one particular non-limiting embodiment, the passivating polymer<br>
useful in the present invention comprises an epoxy polymer with at least one nitro group substituent and at least one phosphoric acid group having an equivalent ratio of epoxy: nitro group: phosphoric acid of 3.8 / 0.3 / 4.8 to 3.8 / 3 / 0.8. In another non-limiting embodiment, the equivalent ratio of epoxy: nitro group: phosphoric acid can be 3.8 / 0.8 / 4.2 to 3.8 /1 / 3.2.<br>
[0035]	It has been found that contacting a metallic pigment with a passivating<br>
polymer, such as any of those described above, reduces or prevents hydrolysis or oxidation of the pigment and thereby reduces or eliminates altogether the generation of hydrogen gas   Moreover, the inclusion of metallic pigment treated with such a polymer in a waterborne coating composition does not disadvantageously affect humidity resistance of dry films (coatings) produced from such waterborne compositions.<br>
[0036]	An exemplary waterborne coating composition of the invention<br>
typically comprises a film-forming polymer, an aqueous diluent medium, and a metallic pigment at least partially treated with a passivating polymer of the invention. The tendency of the pigment to react with the aqueous medium and release gaseous material is prevented or reduced by the incorporation of an effective amount of a passivating material of the invention.<br>
[0037]	Examples of metallic pigments suitable for use in a waterborne<br>
coating composition of the invention include any metallic pigments that are generally known for use in pigmented coating compositions. Examples include, without limitation, metallic pigments, such as metallic flake pigments, comprised at least<br><br>
partly of aluminum, copper, zinc, iron, and/or brass as well as those composed of<br>
other malleable metals and alloys such as nickel, tin, silver, chrome, aluminum-<br>
copper alloy, aluminum-zinc alloy, and aluminum-magnesium alloy. Moreover, a<br>
waterborne coating composition of the invention also can include one or more of a<br>
wide variety of other pigments generally known for use in coating compositions, such<br>
as various color-producing pigments and/or filler pigments. Examples of such<br>
pigments include, without limitation, generally known pigments based on metal<br>
oxides; metal hydroxides; metal sulfides; metal sulfates; metal carbonates; carbon<br>
black; china clay; phthalo blues and greens, organo-reds, and organic dyes.<br>
[0038]	Various procedures can be used to incorporate a passivating material<br>
comprising a passivating polymer of the invention, such as any of those described previously, into a coating composition, such as but not limited to a waterborne coating composition of the invention. By "waterborne" coating composition is meant a coating composition in which the diluent medium is primarily an aqueous medium, i.e., the waterborne coating composition is free or substantially free of organic solvent.  By "substantially free of organic solvent" is meant that the amount of organic solvent; if present, is less than 20 weight percent based on the total weight of the coating composition, such as less than 10 weight percent, such a less than 5 weight percent, such as less than 2 weight percent, such as less than 1 weight percent. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the coating art, in one non-limiting embodiment of the invention the waterborne coating composition can include a small amount of organic solvent to affect one or more of the coating properties, such as to improve flow or leveling of the applied composition or to decrease viscosity as needed. One method of incorporating the passivating material comprising a polymer of the invention is to bring the metallic pigment into contact with the passivating material prior to the incorporation of the pigment into the waterborne coating composition. This can be done by adding the passivating material of the invention to the pigment paste (e.g., pigment as normally supplied commercially), or it can be added at an earlier stage such as during the actual production of the pigment. Alternatively, a passivating material can be introduced into a waterbome coating composition of the invention by simply introducing it "neat", i.e., as a further ingredient in the formulation of the waterborne coating composition, for example during the mixing of film-forming resin, metallic pigment and aqueous medium together with other conventional and optional constituents such as crosslinking agents, co-solvents, thickeners and fillers. Irrespective of the manner in which a passivating material of the invention is<br><br>
incorporated into a waterborne coating composition of the invention, an amount of<br>
such compound generally is employed which is effective in reducing or eliminating<br>
gassing of the metallic pigment in the aqueous medium. For example, the amount of<br>
the passivating material can be in the range of 5 weight percent to 200 weight<br>
percent passivating material solids based on the weight of pigment solids, such as in<br>
the range of 10 weight percent to 100 weight percent, such as in the range of 10<br>
weight percent to 80 weight percent, such as in the range of 15 weight percent to 50<br>
weight percent, such as in the range of 16 weight percent to 25 weight percent.<br>
[0039]	One exemplary substantially organic solvent-free coating composition<br>
of the present invention can be a thermoplastic film-forming composition, or, alternatively, a thermosetting composition. As used herein, by "thermosetting composition" is meant one which "sets" irreversibly upon curing or crosslinking, wherein the polymer chains of the polymeric components are joined together by covalent bonds. This property is usually associated with a crosslinking reaction of the composition constituents often induced, for example, by heat or radiation. Hawley, Gessner G., The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, Ninth Edition., page 856; Surface Coatings, vol. 2, Oil and Colour Chemists' Association, Australia, TAPE Educational Books (1974). Curing or crosslinking reactions also may be carried out under ambient conditions. Once cured or crosslinked, a thermosetting composition will not melt upon the application of heat and is insoluble in solvents. By contrast, a 'thermoplastic composition" comprises polymeric components which are not joined by covalent bonds and thereby can undergo liquid flow upon heating and are soluble in solvents. Saunders, K.J., Organic Polymer Chemistry, pp. 41-42, Chapman and Hall, London (1973).<br>
[0040]	An exemplary coating composition of the invention comprises a diluent<br>
medium, a resinous binder system, a passivating material comprising a polymer of<br>
the invention, and at least one metal pigment: particle. For example, the pigment<br>
particle can be at least partially treated with a passivating material of the invention.<br>
[0041]	The diluent medium can be a solventborne diluent medium or an<br>
aqueous (e.g., waterborne) diluent medium. By "solventborne" is meant that the<br>
diluent material is primarily a non-aqueous, e.g., organic solvent, material.<br>
[0042]	The resinous binder system typically comprises (a) at least one<br>
reactive functional group-containing film-forming polymer and (b) at least one crosslinking agent having functional groups reactive with the functional groups of the film-forming polymer.<br><br>
[0043]	The film-forming polymer (a) can comprise any of a variety of reactive<br>
group-containing polymers well known in the surface coatings art provided the polymer is sufficiently dispersible in the diluentmedia. Suitable non-limiting examples can include acrylic polymers, polyester polymers, polyurethane polymers, polyether polymers, polysiloxane polymers, polyepoxide polymers, copolymers thereof, and mixtures thereof. Also, the polymer (a) can comprise a variety of reactive functional groups, for example, functional groups selected from at least one of hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, epoxy groups, amino groups, amido groups, carbamate groups, isocyanate groups, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0044]	For example, suitable hydroxyl group-containing polymers can include<br>
acrylic polyols, polyester polyols, polyurethane polyols, polyether polyols, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0045]	Suitable hydroxyl group and/or carboxyl group-containing acrylic<br>
polymers can be prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
and are typically copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid and/or hydroxylalkyl esters of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid with one or more other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers such as alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid including methyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate and 2-ethyl hexylacrylate, and vinyl<br>
aromatic compounds such as styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, and vinyl toluene.<br>
[0046]	In a one embodiment of the present invention, the acrylic polymer can<br>
be prepared from ethylenically unsaturated, beta-hydraxy ester functional monomers, such as those described above.<br>
[0047]	Epoxy functional groups can be incorporated into the acrylic polymer<br>
prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers by copolymerizing<br>
oxirane group-containing monomers, for example glycidyl (meth)acrylate and allyl<br>
glycidyl ether, with other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as<br>
those discussed above. Preparation of such epoxy functional acrylic polymers is<br>
described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,001,156 at columns 3 to 6.<br>
[0048]	Carbamate functional groups can be incorporated into the acrylic<br>
polymer prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers by copolyrnerizing, for example, the above-described ethylenically unsaturated monomers with a carbamate functional vinyl monomer such as a carbamate functional alkyl ester of methacrylic acid. Useful carbamate functional alkyl esters can be prepared by reacting, for example, a hydroxyalkyl carbamate, such as the reaction product of ammonia and ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate, with<br><br>
methacrylic anhydride. Other useful carbarnate functional vinyl monomers include,<br>
for instance, the reaction product of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate, and hydroxypropyl carbamate; or the reaction product of hydroxypropyl<br>
methacrylate, isophorone diisocyanate, and methanol. Still other carbamate<br>
functional vinyl monomers may be used, such as the reaction product of isocyanic<br>
acid (HNCO) with a hydroxyl functional acrylic or methacrylic monomer such as<br>
hydroxyethyl acrylate, and those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,479,328. Carbamate<br>
functional groups can also be incorporated into the acrylic polymer by reacting a<br>
hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer with a low molecular weight alkyl carbamate, such<br>
as methyl carbamate. Pendant carbamate groups can also be incorporated into the<br>
acrylic polymer by a "transcarbamoylation" reaction in which a hydroxyl functional<br>
acrylic polymer is reacted with a low molecular weight carbamate derived from an<br>
alcohol or a glycol ether. The carbamate groups exchange with the hydroxyl groups<br>
yielding the carbamate functional acrylic polymer and the original alcohol or glycol<br>
ether. Also, hydroxyl functional acrylic polymers can be reacted with isocyanic acid<br>
to provide pendent carbamate groups. Likewise, hydroxyl functional acrylic polymers<br>
can be reacted with urea to provide pendent carbamate groups.<br>
[0049]	The polymers prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers can be prepared by solution polymerization techniques, which are well known to those skilled in the art, in the presence of suitable catalysts such as organic peroxides or azo compounds, for example, benzoyl peroxide or N,N-azobis(isobutylronitrile). The polymerization can be carried out in an organic solution in which the monomers are soluble by techniques conventional in the art. Alternatively, these polymers can be prepared by aqueous emulsion or dispersion polymerization techniques which are well known in the art. The ratio of reactants and reaction conditions are selected to result in an acrylic polymer with the desired pendent functionality.<br>
[0050]	Polyester polymers are also useful in the film-forming compositions of<br>
the invention. Useful polyester polymers typically include the condensation products of polyhydric alcohols and polycarboxylic acids. Suitable polyhydric alcohols can include ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, trimethylo! propane, and pentaerythritol. Suitable polycarboxylic acids can include adipic acid, 1,4-cyctohexyl dicarboxylic acid, and hexahydrophthalic acid. Besides the polycarboxylic acids mentioned above, functional equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower alkyl esters of the acids such as the methyl esters can be used. Also, small<br><br>
amounts of monocarboxylic acids such as stearic acid can be used. The ratio of<br>
reactants and reaction conditions are selected to result in a polyester polymer with<br>
the desired pendent functionality, i.e., carboxyl or hydroxyl functionality.<br>
[0051]	For example, hydroxyl group-containing polyesters can be prepared<br>
by reacting an anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid such as hexahydrophthalic anhydride<br>
with a diol such as neopentyl glycol in a 1:2 molar ratio. Where it is desired to<br>
enhance air drying, suitable drying oil fatty acids may be used and include those<br>
derived from linseed oil, soya bean oil, tall oil, dehydrated castor oil, ortung oil.<br>
[0052]	Carbamate functional polyesters can be prepared by first forming a<br>
hydroxyalkyl carbamate that can be reacted with the polyacids and polyols used in<br>
forming the polyester. Alternatively, terminal carbamate functional groups can be<br>
incorporated into the polyester by reacting isocyanic acid with a hydroxy functional<br>
polyester. Also, carbamate functionality can be incorporated into the polyester by<br>
reacting a hydroxyl polyester with a urea.  Additionally, carbamate groups can be<br>
incorporated into the polyester by a transcarbamoylation reaction. Preparation of<br>
suitable carbamate functional group-containing polyesters are those described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,593,733 at column 2, line 40 to column 4, line 9.<br>
[0053]	Polyurethane polymers containing terminal isocyanate or hydroxyl<br>
groups also can be used as the polymer in the coating compositions of the invention. The poiyurethane polyols or NCO-terminated polyurethanes which can be used are those prepared by reacting polyols including polymeric polyols with polyisocyanates. Polyureas containing terminal isocyanate or primary and/or secondary amine groups which also can be used are those prepared by reacting polyamines including polymeric polyamines with polyisocyanates. The hydroxyl/isocyanate or amine/isocyanate equivalent ratio is adjusted and reaction conditions are selected to obtain the desired terminal groups. Examples of suitable polyisocyanates include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,729 at column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 28, incorporated herein by reference. Examples of suitable polyols include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,729 at column 7, line 52 to column 10, line 35. Examples of suitable polyamines include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,729 at column 6, line 61 to column 7, line 32 and in U.S. Patent No. 3,799,854 at column 3, lines 13 to 50.<br>
[0054]	Carbamate functional groups can be introduced into the poiyurethane<br>
polymers by reacting a polyisocyanate with a polyester having hydroxyl functionality and containing pendent carbamate groups. Alternatively, the poiyurethane can be<br><br>
prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate with a polyester polyol and a hydroxyalkyl carbamate or isocyanic acid as separate reactants. Examples of suitable polyisocyanates are aromatic isocyanates, such as 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,3-phenylene diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate, and aliphatic polyisocyanates, such as 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate. Cycloaliphatic diisocyanates, such as 1,4-cyclohexyl diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate also can be employed.<br>
[0055]	Examples of suitable polyether polyols include polyalkylene ether<br>
polyols such as those having the following structural formulas (I) or (II):<br><br><br>
•O<br>
H-<br><br>
CH<br>
R<br><br>

wherein the substituent R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group containing from 1 to 5<br>
carbon atoms including mixed substituents, and n has a value typically ranging from<br>
2 to 6 and m has a value ranging from 8 to 100 or higher. Exemplary polyalkylene<br>
ether polyols include poly(oxytetramethylene) glycols, poly(oxytetraethylene) glycols,<br>
poly(oxy-1,2-propylene) glycols, and poly(oxy-1,2-butylene) glycols.<br>
[0056]	Also useful are polyether polyols formed from oxyalkylation of various<br>
polyols, for example, glycols such as ethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, Bisphenol A, and the like, or other higher polyols such as trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and the like. Polyols of higher functionality which can be utilized as indicated can be made, for instance, by oxyalkylation of compounds such as sucrose or sorbitol. One commonly utilized oxyalkylation method is reaction of a polyol with an alkylene oxide, for example, propylene or ethylene oxide, in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst. Specific examples of polyethers include those sold under the names TERATHANE and TERACOL, available from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc.<br><br>
[0057]	As previously mentioned, in certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the film-forming composition may also comprise (b) one or more crosslinking agents that are adapted to react with the functional groups of the polymer and/or any of the previously mentioned polymeric microparticles and/or addivites to provide curing, if desired, for the film-forming composition. Non-limiting examples of suitable crosslinking agents include any of the aminoplasts and polyisocyanates as are well known in the surface coatings art, provided that the crosslinking agent(s) are adapted to be water soluble or water dispersible as described below, and polyacids, polyanhydrides and mixtures thereof. When used, selection of the crosslinking agent or mixture of crosslinking agents is dependent upon the functionality associated with the polymeric microparticles, such as hydroxyl and/or carbamate functionality. When, for example, the functionality is hydroxyl, the hydrophilic crosslinking agent may be an arninoplast or polyisocyanate crosslinking agent.<br>
[0058]	Examples of arninoplast resins suitable for use as the crosslinking<br>
agent include those containing methylol or similar alkylol groups, a portion of which have been etherified by reaction with a lower alcohol, such as methanol, to provide a water soluble/dispersible arninoplast resin. One appropriate arninoplast resin is the partially methylated arninoplast resin, CYMEL 385, which is commercially available from Cytec Industries, Inc. An example of a blocked isocyanate which is water soluble/dispersible and suitable for use as the crosslinking agent is dimethyl pyrazole blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer commercially available as Bl 7986 from Baxenden Chemicals, Ltd. in Lancashire, England.<br>
[0059]	Polyacid crosslinking materials suitable for use in the present<br>
invention can include, for example, those that on average generally contain greater than one acid group per molecule, sometimes three or more and sometimes four or more, such acid groups being reactive with epoxy functional film-forming polymers. Polyacid crosslinking materials may have di-, tri- or higher functionalities. Suitable polyacid crosslinking materials which can be used include, for example, carboxylic acid group-containing oligomers, polymers and compounds, such as acrylic polymers, polyesters, and polyurethanes and compounds having phosphorus-based acid groups.<br>
[0060]	Examples of suitable polyacid crosslinking agents include, for<br>
example, ester group-containing oligomers and compounds including half-esters formed from reacting polyols and cyclic 1,2-acid anhydrides or acid functional<br><br>
polyesters derived from polyols and polyacids or anhydrides. These half-esters are of relatively low molecular weight and are quite reactive with epoxy functionality. Suitable ester group-containing oligomers include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,430, column 4, line 26 to column 5, line 68, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0061]	Other useful crosslinking agents include acid-functional acrylic<br>
crosslinkers made by copolymerizing methacrylic acid and/or acrylic acid monomers with other ethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomers as the polyacid crosslinking material. Alternatively, acid-functional acrylics can be prepared from hydroxy-functional acrylics reacted with cyclic anhydrides.<br>
[0062]	In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
crosslinking agent (b) which typically is water soluble/dispersible, may be present as a component in the film-forming composition in an amount ranging from 0 to at least 10 weight percent, or at least 10 to at least 20 weight percent, or from at least 20 to at least 30 weight percent based on total resin solids weight in the film-forming composition.  In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, the crosslinking agent may be present as a component in the film-forming composition in an amount ranging from less than or equal to 70 to less than or equal to 60 weight percent, or less than or equal to 60 to less than or equal to 50 weight percent, or less than or equal to 50 to less than or equal to 40 weight percent based on total resin solids weight of the film-forming composition. The crosslinking agent can be present in the film-forming composition in an amount ranging between any combination of these values inclusive of the recited ranges.<br>
[0063]	Resinous binders for a basecoat can be organic solvent-based<br>
materials, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,220,679, note column 2, line 24 continuing through column 4, line 40. Also, water-based coating compositions, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,403,003, U.S. Patent No. 4,147,679, and U.S. Patent No. 5,071,904, can be used as the binder in the basecoat composition.<br>
[0064]	The coating composition can include various other ingredients<br>
generally known for use in waterborne coating compositions. Examples of various other ingredients include: fillers; plasticizers; antioxidants; mildewcides and fungicides; surfactants; various flow control agents including, for example, thixotropes and additives for sag resistance and/or pigment orientation such as precipitated silicas, fumed silicas, organo-modified silicas, bentone clays, organo-<br><br>
modified bentone clays, and such additives based on polymer microparticles (sometimes referred to as microgels) described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.025,474; 4,055.607; 4.075,141; 4,115,472; 4,147.688; 4.180.489; 4,242,384; 4,268,547; 4,220,679; and 4,290,932.<br>
[0065]	Examples of organic solvents and/or diluents that can be employed in<br>
an organic solvent-borne coating composition of the invention include alcohols, such as lower alkanols containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms including methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, butanol, sec-butyl alcohol, tertbutyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol; ethers and ether alcohols such as ethyleneglycol monoethyl ether, ethyleneglycol rnonobutyl ether, ethyleneglycol dibutyl ether, propyleneglycof monomethyl ether, diethyleneglycoi rnonobutyl ether, diethyleneglycol dibutyl ether, dipropyleneglycol monomethyl ether, and dipropyleneglycol monobutyl ether; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl arnyl ketone and methyl N-butyl ketone; esters such as butyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate and 2 ethylhexyl acetate; aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as the various petroleum naphthas and cyclohexane; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene. The amount of organic solvent and/or diluent utilized in an organic solvent-borne coating composition of the invention may vary widely. However, in one non-limiting embodiment, the amount of organic solvent and/or diluent can range from about 10 percent to about 50 percent, such as from 20 percent to 40 percent, by weight based on the total weight of organic solvent-borne coating composition.<br>
[0066]	Passivating materials of the present invention can also be utilized in<br>
powder coating compositions comprising a film-forming polymer and a pigment (typically a metallic pigment).<br>

construed as a limitation on the scope thereof. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, all percentages and amounts are understood to be by weight.<br>

[0088]	The pre-emulsion was passed once through a MICROFLUIDIZER<br>
RTM M110T at 8000 psi and transferred to a four neck round bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, condenser, thermometer, and a nitrogen atmosphere. 150.0 g of deionized water used to rinse the MICROFLUIDIZER RTM was added to the flask   The polymerization was initiated by adding 4.0 g of isoascorbic acid and 0.02 g of ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolved in 120.0 g water followed by an addition over a thirty minute period of 4.0 g of 70% t-butyf hydroperoxide (dissolved in 115.0 g of water)  The reaction temperature increased from 24°C to 85°C during this time. The temperature was reduced to 26°C at which time 36 g of 33.3% aqueous dirnethylethanolamine was added, followed by 2.0 g of PROXEL GXL (biocide commercially available from ICI Americas, Inc.) in 8.0 g of water. The pH of the latex thus formed was 7.9, the nonvolatile content was 42.0%, and the Brookfield viscosity was 17 cps (spindle #1, 50 rpm).<br>

[0095]	Each of the aqueous basecoat compositions of Examples BC1 to BC10 was<br>
prepared by mixing the above-listed ingredients under agitation. The pH of each composition was adjusted to 8.4-8.6 using an appropriate amount of a 50% aqueous solution of DMEA.  Following an equilibration period of sixteen hours at ambient conditions, the pH of each basecoat was readjusted to 8.4-8.6 using an appropriate amount of a 50% aqueous solution of DMEA.  The viscosity of each of the compositions then was reduced to 24 to 26 seconds spray viscosity (Ford #4 cup) using deionized water. The samples were then placed into the gassing test as described below.<br>
GASSING EVALUATION<br>
[0096]	Each of the aqueous basecoat compositions of Examples BC1 to BC10 was<br>
evaluated to measure the amount of gas evolved from an aluminum flake-containing waterborne coating. The test method was used to determine the effectiveness of aluminum flake passivators (i.e., gassing inhibitors) in stopping or inhibiting the reaction between the aluminum pigment surface and water, which generates hydrogen gas and heat. The method included foading an aluminum flake-containing waterborne paint into a gassing experiment apparatus which measured the amount of gas evolved in milliliters (ml) of gas evolved per 200 grams of basecoat composition over a period of 7 days.<br>
[0097]	Following the final pH and viscosity adjustments described above, 200 grams<br>
of each basecoat composition was placed into a separate 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask and<br>
capped with a greased glass adapter with a hose connector (Tygon tubing). A taper clip was<br>
attached at the joint of the flask and adapter. A lead weight was placed around each of the<br>
filled Erlenmeyer flasks and each was then placed into a pre-set constant temperature bath<br>
of 40°C. Four hours in the bath was then allowed for temperature equilibration.<br>
[0098]	While the compositions were equilibrating, ring stands and burettes were<br>
assembled in a Nalgene tub next to the constant temperature bath. Ring stands were placed in the Nalgene tub filled with water. Burette clamps were attached to the ring stands. For each basecoat, a 250 ml burette was filled with water and inverted in the Nalgene tub filled with water The inverted burette was placed so that the top of the inverted burette was below the top of the water level in the tub. The burettes were cfamped into place with burette clamps.<br>
[0099]	Following the equilibration period, the Tygon tubing was inserted into the<br>
inverted burette and then attached to the end of the hose adapter on the flasks inside the constant temperature bath. The initial water level in the burette was then recorded (in ml). The difference between the initial water level and the final water level after 7 days in the test apparatus was recorded as the amount of gas evolved from the basecoat. As will be<br><br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art, gassing results can differ from one run to another due to slight changes in the experimental conditions. Therefore, the gassing results in Table 11 should be understood to have a tolerance of plus or minus about 5 ml. {0100] The gassing data presented in Table 11 below illustrates that aqueous metallic basecoat compositions containing the aluminum passivators of the present invention (i.e., the compositions of Examples BC2 to BC14) provide similar or improved aluminum flake passivation as compared with the commercially available passivator (Example BC1).<br>

[0109]	Each of the aqueous basecoat compositions of Examples BC14 to BC17 was<br>
prepared by mixing the above-listed ingredients under agitation. The pH of each composition was adjusted to 8.4-8.6 using an appropriate amount of a 50% aqueous solution of DMEA. Following an equilibration period of sixteen hours at ambient conditions, (he pH of each basecoat was readjusted to 8.4-8.6 using an appropriate amount of a 50% aqueous solution of DMEA. The viscosity of each of the compositions then was reduced to 24 to 26 seconds spray viscosity (Ford #4 cup) using deionized water. The samples were then placed into the gassing test as described below.<br>
GASSING EVALUATION<br>
[0110]	Each of the aqueous basecoat compositions of Examples BC14 to BC17 was<br>
evaluated according to a test method that measures the amount of gas evolved from an aluminum flake-containing waterborne coating. This test method is used to determine the effectiveness of aluminum flake passivators (i.e., gassing inhibitors) in stopping or inhibiting the reaction between the aluminum pigment surface and water, which generates hydrogen gas and heat. The method involves loading an aluminum flake-containing waterborne paint into a gassing experiment apparatus that measures the amount of gas evolved in ml of gas per 250 gram of paint over 7 days.<br><br>
[0111]	Following the final pH and viscosity adjustments described above, 250 grams<br>
of each basecoat was placed into a gassing bottle and placed in a waterbath of 40°C.  Each sample was placed into the waterbath as quickly as possible to after it was reduced to capture all possible gassing. The results are set forth in Table 17.<br>
