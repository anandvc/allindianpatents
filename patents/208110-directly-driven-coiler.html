Directly driven coiler<br>
The invention relates to a directly driven coiler for winding rolled strip to coils according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such directly driven coilers have become known, for example, through DE:PS 17 52 185 or DE-OS 39 39 119. Here the relative axial displacement between the coiler shaft and the plunger connected with the segments is effected via mechanical actuating drives. These are toggle drives or laminated springs and spacing elements respectively, all of which can be activated only when the coiler is stationary. Any adjustment during the coiling operation is impossible with these actuating drives.<br>
Through DE-OS 35 02 452, also piston-cylinder units have become known, by means of which laminated springs affected by the above-described disadvantages and serving as an actuating drive can be tensioned or slackened.<br>
EP-PS 0 004 854, too. discloses a piston-cylinder unit which serves directly as an actuating drive for the expansion or releasing of the coiler. These two coilers equipped with piston-cylinder units are, however, not generic directly driven coilers but indirectly driven coilers with which the driying motor is located beside the coiler shaft.<br>
The coiler according to EP-OS 0 004 854 does have central rotary feeders, so that, for example, adjustment is possible during the coiling operation. If, however, the driving motor for the coiler were flanged directly to the coiler shaft, difficulties would arise with the pressure medium feed, as only solid motor shafts are used as a rule, so that the<br><br>
pressure medium could not be led to the piston-cylinder unit from the end of the shaft where it is fed in. Should the pressure medium feed, however, be laid through the motor shaft, metal particles in the pressure medium may be magnetized by the magnetic action in the motor and possible lead to blockages of the incoming lines. Furthermore, intricate flexible pressure medium connections would have to be provided in order to be able to bridge any lateral offsets or axial displacements between driving unit and coiler shaft.<br>
Through DE-PS 38 06 931, rotary feeders by means of which pressure medium can be fed radially into a shaft have indeed become known; these rotary feeders have for optimal operation very close production tolerances which preclude application in adverse conditions, as prevail in rolling mills. In addition, these rotary feeders can be used only with sizes of not more than 80 mm diameter at the annular gap. For this reason, too, application in rolling mill operations, e.g. in rolling mill coilers, where substantially larger diameters are used, was not feasible.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the technical problem of developing a generic directly driven coiler in such a way that it is also expandable or releasable during the coiler operation.<br>
To solve this problem, the features of claim 1 according to the invention are proposed. By means of the rotary feeder, a connection is created between the piston-cylinder unit and a source of pressure medium, by means of which source the piston-cylinder unit can be constantly supplied with pressure medium even if the coiler is driven by rotary actuator for the purpose of winding strip on or off.<br>
The rotary feeder is to be positioned in such a way that none of the pressure medium lines runs through the shaft of the motor flanged to the coiler shaft or the shaft shoulder. It is therefore foreseen that the rotary feeder should be located on the shaft shoulder. There is, however, also the possibility to provide the rotary feeder on the coiler shaft oneself.<br><br>
Through the use of a dual action differential piston, the necessary expansion and releasing forces can be set with a corresponding pressure of the pressure medium.<br>
In that the rotary feeder has a stationary housing, the external connections can be rigidly positioned with the rotary feeder. Intricate and susceptible flexible hoses are not necessary here. The bushes located in the housing can be produced substantially more easily than if the housing were to have a corresponding bush form. In addition, through the separate provision of a housing, of bushes and of the sleeve, different material pairings can be realized, which guarantee lowest possible wear and which are coordinated  in their thermal<br>
*<br>
expansion, so that the gaps between the bushes and the sleeve are also optimally dimensioned with the adverse conditions in rolling mills.<br>
The sleeve equipped with feeding channels is easy to manufacture from the production engineering aspect. Its application permits the use of solid, non-drilled shaft shoulders, whereby a high stability of the shaft shoulders is guaranteed.<br>
The pressure medium emerging between the sleeve and the bushes, through which medium the bush is supported on the sleeve by means of an oil film, is carried away to a tank via leakage oil tubes. Leakage oil tubes which end in the oil tank are also assigned to the piston-cylinder unit. The leakage oil tubes of the piston-cylinder unit carry oil only when seals of the piston-cylinder unit are defective. In this case, leakage oil detectors which indicate the defect in the seals can be provided.<br>
In order not to let the oil film between the sleeve and the bushes be interrupted during the coiler operation, a given oil pressure threshold must always be maintained on the pressure medium lines. The "expansion" pressure oil line is thereby under sufficient pressure, so that a stable oil film is guaranteed. The "releasing" pressure medium line could theoretically be unpressurized during the coiler operation, whereby<br><br>
damage would occur to the rotary feeder, however, if the oil pressure threshold were not also maintained on the "releasing" pressure line.<br>
There is, however, also the possibility to provide additional annular channels and radial bores in the bushes in order to maintain statically an oil film between the sleeve and the corresponding bush. In this case the "releasing" pressure medium line can remain unpressurized even during operation. The oil film serves thereby to absorb the great weight of the bushes and any acceleration forces occurring at the rolling mill coilers as a result of vibrations. One substantial advantage of the static oil film is yielded thereby through the resilient widening of the sealing gap. By this means, defects of form, e.g. deviations from the circular form, which may occur as a result of the mechanical processing and a change of the internal stress status under pressure and temperature, are compensated.<br>
The ceramic coatings proposed in claim 10 guarantee a longer life of the sleeve and the bushes. The compliant mounting of the bushes in the housing, e.g. by means of O-rings, is of advantage in compensating the deviations of symmetry which may occur in the production of the individual components. The bushes are centred on the sleeve by the oil film and are given by the O-rings the opportunity to adapt to the position of the sleeve.<br>
The invention is explained in further detail by means of a drawing in which<br>
Figure 1	shows a coiler according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2	shows a sectional partial view according to Fig. 1,<br>
Figure 3	shows a piston-cylinder unit according to the invention.<br>
Figure 4	shows a rotary feeder according to the invention.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a coiler 1 which comprises a drum 2 on which a coil 3 is wound, a coiler shaft 4, a shaft shoulder 5. a shaft coupling 6 and a motor 7. A rotary feeder 8 is located on the shaft shoulder 5. A pusher 10 which serves to push the coils 3 from the drum 2 located on a guide 9 is assigned to the coiler 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the drum 2 partially in expanded and partially in released position. The drum segments 11 are thereby movable via a plunger 12 and a connection flange 13 on the coiler shaft 4. The plunger 12 is drivable by means of a piston-cylinder unit 14 which is connected by pressure medium lines 15,15' with the rotary feeder 8.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the piston 16 and the cylinder 17 of the piston-cylinder unit 14, which unit is integrated into the coiler shaft 4. The cylinder 17 is held axially by means of the shaft shoulder 5. The piston 16 is connected by screws 18 with the plunger 12. The pressure medium lines 15, 15' shown in tandem arrangement in Fig. 3 end in the cylinder compartments 19, 20. The piston 16 is sealed by means of sealing rings 21 in the cylinder 17. Leakage oil tubes 22 serve to intercept and to lead off to an oil tank (not shown) any quantity of leakage oil emerging. If the leakage oil tubes 22 are carrying oil, this is a sign that the sealing rings 21 are damaged.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the shaft shoulder 5 on which the rotary feeder 8 is located. The rotary feeder 8 comprises a housing 23 in which bushes 24, 25 are mounted. The bushes 24, 25 are mounted on a sleeve 26 which surrounds the shaft shoulder 5.<br>
At the housing 23 a connection 27 for the pressure medium for the expansion procedure of the drum 2 and a connection 28 for the pressure medium for releasing the drum 2 are provided. The bushes 24, 25 have annular channels 29 in the area of the connections 27, 28 overlapping them, by means of which channels discharge bores 30 are connected with annular channels 31. The annular channels 31 are<br><br>
opposite discharge bores 32 in the sleeve 26. The discharge bores 32 end in the pressure medium lines 15,15'.<br>
The bushes 24 and 25 are mounted in the housing 23 by means of O-rings 33. An oil film on which the bush 24 floats forms between the bush 24 and the sleeve 26 during operation. The oil emerging between the bush 24 and the sleeve 26 is intercepted by a leakage oil tube and led to the oil tank (not shown).<br>
The annular channel 31 of the bush 25 which is opposite the connection 28 for the releasing can be unpressurized during normal coiler operation. If a bush corresponding to the bush 24 were to be used for this bush 25, a certain pressure would have to be present on the releasing line during the coiler operation so that the lubrication between the bush and the sleeve 26 is guaranteed.<br>
The bush 25 shown in Fig. 4 has, however, further annular channels 34, 35; 34'. 35' and radial bores 36; 36' via which a pressure medium is constantly led into the gap be-rween the bush 25 and the sleeve 26 to maintain the lubricant film. The connection 37 serves to direct the lubricant to the bush 25 in order to guarantee the hydrostatic bearing of the bush 25 on the sleeve 26 without medium having to be pressurized at the connection 28. A corresponding hydrostatic system can, of course, also be provided for the bush 24 or further bushes (not shown).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
