(b)	of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra.<br>
(c)	an Indian Company ;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention (and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.	<br><br><br><br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT GRANULE AND DETERGENT COMPOSITION CONTAINING<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry treatment granule.  It further extends to granular detergent compositions comprising a firstl crranule, which comprises detergent active, and a second (granule, which is according to the invention.  The invention further extends to a process for manufacturing a laundry treatment granule according to the invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Repeated washing of garments, particularly those comprising cotton or other cellulosic fibres, causes gradual loss of material from individual fibres; and the loss of whole fibres from the fabric.  These processes of attrition result in thinning of the fabric, eventually rendering it semi-transparent, more prone to accidental tearing and generally detracting from its original appearance.<br>
Hitherto, there has been no way of minimising this kind of damage except by employing less frequent washing and use cf less harsh detergent products and/or wash conditions, which obviously tends to less effective cleaning.<br><br>
In laundry cleaning or treatment products, it is essential for some ingredients to be deposited onto and adhere to the fabric for them to deliver their beneficial effects. Typical examples are fabric conditioners or softeners. Nevertheless, the benefits conferred by such conventional materials do not include rebuilding the fabric. It has now been found possible, to include in laundry products, agents which deposit cellulose or cellulose-like materials onto the fabric to at least partially replace the lost material of the fibre.<br>
Our copending application WO 00/18860 describes a wide general class of fabric rebuild agents, which can rebuild fabric during a laundry operation.  It has been found that, during storage of the formulation, normal conditions of humidity, temperature and alkalinity within the package are such that the fabric rebuild agent degrades so that it can become insoluble and ineffective.  The present i.nventors have found that this problem can be overcome by formulating the fabric rebuild agent into a granule which also comprises acidic binder and a neutral filler.  This granule can then be admixed to conventional powder laundry detergent compositions.<br>

In a second aspect, the present invention provides a laundry treatment granule comprising:<br>
(a)  50-90% by weight based on the granule of a water-soluble or water-dispersible rebuild agent for deposition onto a fabric during a laundry treatment process wherein the rebuild agent undergoes during the laundry treatment process, a chemical change by which change the affinity of the rebuild agent for the fabric is increased, the chemical change occurring in or to a group or groups covalently bonded to be pendant on a polymeric backbone of the rebuild agent and which backbone comprises cellulose units or other p-1,4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the total of all groups pendant on the saccharide<br><br>

Further, the present invention extends to a granular laundry detergent composition, comprising a first granule ..which comprises a laundry detergent active and a second granule, which is a granule according to the present invention.<br>
Definitions<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Throughout this specification, "average degree of substitution" refers to the number of substituted pendant groups per saccharide ring, averaged over all saccharide rings of the rebuild agent.  Each saccharide ring prior to substitution has three -OH groups and therefore, an average degree of substitution of 3 means that each of these groups en all molecules of the sample, bears a substituent.<br><br>
By ester linkage is meant that the hydrogen of an -OK group has been replaced by a substituent such as R'-CO-, R'S02- etc to form a carboxylic acid ester, sulphonic acid ester (as appropriate) etc together with the remnant oxygen attached to the saccharide ring.  In some cases, the group R' may for example contain a heteroatom, e.g. as an<br>
-NH- group, attached to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage.  However, the term ester linkage is still to be construed as encompassing these structures.  The compositions according to the second aspect are not limited to those incorporating rebuild agents incorporating monocarboxylic acid ester linkages.<br>
Optionally, the rebuild agent used in the granule may be as defined for both the first and second aspects of the invention, simultaneously.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
The Rebuild Agent<br>
The exact mechanism by which the rebuild agents exert their effect is not fully understood.  Whether or not they can repair thinned or damaged fibres is not known.  However, they are capable of replacing lost fibre weight with deposited and/or bonded material, usually of cellulosic cype.  This can provide one or more advantages such as repair or rebuilding of the fabric, strengthening of the textile or giving it enhanced body or smoothness, reducing its transparency, reducing fading of colours, improving the<br><br>
appearance of the fabric or of individual fibres, improved comfort during garment wear, dye transfer inhibition, increased stiffness, anti-wrinkle, effect and ease of ironing.<br>
In the case of those rebuild agents having a cellulose backbone and pendant ester groups, without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, the inventors have conjectured that the mechanism of deposition is as follows.<br>
Cellulose is substantially insoluble in water.  Attachment of the ester groups causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility.  In the treatment liquor, it is believed that the ester groups are hydrolysed, causing the affinity for the fabric to increase and the polymer to be deposited on the fabric.<br>
The rebuild agent material used in the present invention is water-soluble or water-dispersible in nature and in a preferred form comprises a polymeric backbone having one or more pendant groups which undergo the chemical change to cause an increase in affinity for fabric.<br>
The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the rebuild agent (as determined by GPC) may typically be in the range of 50C to 2,000,000 for example 1,000 to 1,500,000.  Preferably though, it is from 1,000 to 100,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 50,000, especially from 10,000 to 15,000.<br><br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.  Preferably though, the term "water-dispersible" means that the material, in water at pH 7 and at 25°C, produces a solution or a dispersion having long-term stability.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the material for the fabric upon a chemical change, what is meant is that at some time during the treatment process, the amount of material that has been deposited is greater when the chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of chemical change.<br>
Deposition includes adsorption, cocrystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br>
The Polymeric Backbone<br>
For the first aspect of the invention, it is especially preferred that the polymeric backbone is of a similar chemical structure to that of at least some of the fibres of the fabric onto which it is to be deposited.<br><br>
For example, if the fabric is cellulosic in nature, e.g. cotton, the polymeric backbone is preferably cellulose or a cellulose derivative or a another p-l,4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as mannan and glucomannan.  This is essential in the case of the second asjpect of the invention.  The a-verage degree of substitution on the polysaccharide of the.pendant groups which undergo the chemical change (plus any non-functional pendant groups which may be present) is preferably (for compositions according to the first aspect of the invention) or essential (for compositions according to the second aspect of the invention) from 0.3 to 3, more preferably from 0.4 to l.  Still more preferred is a degree of substitution of from 0.5 to 0.75 and yet more preferred is 0.6-0.7.<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (and therefore are not in themselves counted in the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings, which'have pendant hydroxyl groups. The pendant groups can be bonded chemically or by other bonding mechanism, to these hydroxyl groups by any means described hereinbelow.  The "average degree of substitution" means the average number of pendant groups per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear<br><br>
backbone or are themselves, pendant side groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
Other polymeric backbones suitable as according to the present invention include those described in Hydrocolloid Applications, A. Nussinswitch, Blackie 1997. Pendant Groups which undergo the Chemical Change<br>
The chemical change which causes the increased fabric is preferably hydrolysis, perhydrolysis or bond-cleavage, optionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst. Hydrolysis of ester-linked groups is most typical.  However, preferably this change is not merely protonation or deprotonation, i.e. a pH induced effect.<br>
The chemical change occurs in or to a group covalently bonded to a polymeric backbone, especially, the loss of one or more such groups.  These group(s) is/are pendant on the backbone.  In the case of the first aspect of the invention these are ester-linked groups based on monocarboxylic acids.<br>
Preferred for use in the first aspect of the invention are cellulosic polymers of formula (I):-<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein each R1 is independently selected from Cx-ao (preferably CVJalkyl, C2.20 (preferably C2.6) alkenyl (e.g. vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (e.g. phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C1-4 alkyl, Ci-u (preferably C1.4) alkoxy, hydroxy 1, vinyl and phenyl groups ,•  and<br>
each R2 is independently hydrogen or a group R1 as hereinbefore defined.<br><br>
The second aspect of the invention is not limited to (but may include) use of rebuild agents incorporating ester linkages based on monocarboxylic acids.<br>
Preferred for use in the second aspect of the invention are cellulosic polymers of formula (II):-<br><br><br>
(H)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
R3 is a bond or is selected from C].-4 alkylene, C2-
each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen, counter<br>
1 cations such as alkali metal (preferably Na) or jCa or 7 N*c<br>
and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;<br>
wherein each R5 is  independently selected from the group consisting of H, CJ-CJO alkyl, Cs-C7 cycloalkyl, C7-C20 arylalkyl, C7-C20 alkylaryl, substituted alkyl, hydroxyalky;r (R«)2N-alkyl, and (Rs) 3N-alkyl, where R« is independently selected from the group consisting of H, Ci-C2o alkyl, C5-C-cycloalkyl, C7-C20 arylalkyl, C7-C2o alkylaryl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl, piperidinoalkyl, morpholinoalkyl, cycloaminoalkyl and hydroxyalkyl;<br>
groups R which together with the oxygen atom forming the linkage to the respective saccharide ring forms an ester o-,-hemi-ester group of a tricarboxylic- or higher polycarboxylic- or other complex acid such as citric acid, an amino acid, a synthetic amino acid analogue or a protoin.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as already mentioned, in both formula (I) and formula (II) the groups R do not all havn to have the same structure and some of them may have structu 1.-03 which are different to the structures of groups which undergo a chemical change.  For example, one or more R groups may simply be hydrogen or an alkyl group.<br><br>
In the case of formula (II) , some preferred R groups may be independently selected from one or more of<br>
methanesulphonate, toluene, sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, glutamic, aspartic and malic acids.<br>
In the case of formula (I) and formula (II) , they may be independently selected from one or more of acetate, propandate, crifluroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate, cinnamate, formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate and gluconate groups.<br>
Particularly preferred are cellulose monoacetate, cellulose hemisuccinate, and cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propanoate.  The term cellulose monoacetate is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of 1 or less.<br>
Other Pendant Groups<br>
— ■	-      ■*<br>
As mentioned above, preferred (for the first aspect of the invention) or essential (for the second aspect of the invention) are degrees of substitution for the totality of all pendant substituents in the following order of increasing preference:  from 0.3 to 3, from 0.4 to 1, from 0.5 to 0.75, from 0.6 to 0.7.  However, as well as the groups which undergo the chemical change, pendant groups of other types may optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance fabric affinity.<br><br>
Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the rebuild agent (e.g. groups which are, or contain one or more free carbcxylic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy-and/or (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
The other pendant groups preferably constitute from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 10% (e.g. from 0% to 5%) of the total number of pendant groups.  The minimum number of other pendant groups may, for example be 0.1% or 1% of the total. The water-solubilising groups could comprise from 0% to 100% of those other groups but preferably from 0% to 2 0%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, still more preferably from 0% to 5% of the total number of other pendant groups.<br>
Synthetic Routes<br>
Those rebuild agents used in the present invention which are not commercially available may be prepared by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(1) polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example, enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda, &amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, 9_9, 17S-184 or oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g.<br><br>
per H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1432-1434. ;<br>
(2)	derivatisation of a polymeric backbone (either naturally<br>
occurring, especially polysaccharides, especially beta-1,4-<br>
linked polysaccharides, especially cellulose, mannan,<br>
glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan; or synthetic<br>
polymers) up to the required degree of substitution with<br>
functional groups which improve the solubility of the<br>
polymer using a reagent (especially acid halides, especially<br>
carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides, carboxylic acid<br>
anhydrides, carboxylic acids or, carbonates) in a solvent<br>
which either dissolves the backbone, swells the backbone, or<br>
does not swell the backbone but dissolves or swells the<br>
product;<br>
(3)	hydrolysis of polymer derivatives (especially esters) down to the required degree of substitution; or<br>
(4)	a combination of any two or more of routes (l)-(3).<br>
The degree and.pattern of substitution from routes (1) or (2) may be subsequently altered by partial removal of functional groups by hydrolysis or solvolysis or other cleavage.  Relative amounts of reactants and reaction times can also be used to control the degree of substitution.  In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be reduced before, during, or after the derivatisation with functional groups.  The degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be increased by further<br><br>
f<br><br>
polymerisation or by cross linking agents before, during, or after the derivatisation step.<br>
Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride, typically in acetic acid solution at 20 3 0°C.  When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water.  Glycallac and lactic esters can be made in this way.<br>
Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose ■chloracetate (B.P, 320,842) by treating 100 parts with 32 parts of NaOH in alcohol addled in small portions.<br>
An alternative method of preparing cellulose esters consists in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher ionisation constant (F.P. 702,116).  The ester is heated at about 100° with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester.  By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate.  A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also.  As an example cellulose acetate (10 g) in dioxan (75 ml) containing oxalic acid (10 g) is heated at 100° for 2 hours under reflux.<br>
Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, e.g. the acetate, is dissolved in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid<br><br>
(1.82 x 10*s) .  With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used.  If a mixed cellulose ester is treated with an acid this should have an ionisation constant greater than that of either of the acids already in combination.  Thus:<br>
A cellulose acetate-lactate-pyruvate is prepared from cellulose acetate, 40 per cent, acetyl (100 g), in a bath of 125 ml pyruvic acid and 125 ml of 85 per cent, lactic acid by heating at 100° for 18 hours.  The product is soluble in water and is precipitated and washed' with ether-acetone. M.p. 230-250°.<br>
Acidic Binder<br>
By an acidic binder, it is meant a composition which is capable of acting as a binder for a granule, which material gives a pH when dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous solution at a level of 1 g/1 at 20°C of less than 6.<br>
Suitably, the acidic binder is a polymeric material. Suitably, it is a homo or copolymer of monomers selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, alpha-chloro-acrylic acid, crotonic acid, cinnamic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, citraccr.ic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitic acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Polymers and copolymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and maleic acid are particularly preferred, such as Sokalan CP45 (trade mark).<br><br>
The acidic binder may also comprise a long chain monocarboxylic acid, preferably a Cs-C2o  alkyl fatty acid.<br>
Neutral Filler<br>
By neutral filler is meant a solid material suitable for bulking out the granule and which gives a pH, when dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous solution at a level of 1 g/1 at 20°C in the range 8-6.<br>
Suitably, the inert filler comprises sodium sulphate, sodium, acetate or sodium chloride.<br>
Acidic Filler<br>
The granule of the present invention may optionally comprise acidic filler. Acidic filler is defined as a material, suitable for bulking out a granule, which, when dissolved or dispersed in an aqueous solution at a level of 1 g/1 at 20°C gives a pH below 6.  Suitable acidic filers comprise acidic silica and mono or polycarboxylic acids such as malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid or mixtures thereof.<br>
Mixing Ratios<br>
Granules of the present invention preferably comprise 50-75% by weight of the fabric rebuild agent, more preferably 6C-70% by weight.  The granule preferably comprises 7-25% by<br><br>
weight of neutral filler, more preferably 10-20% by weight of neutral filler.  The granule may comprise 5-30% by weight of acidic filler, more preferably 10-20% by weight.  Acidic binder is preferably present at a level in the range 0.4-5.0% by weight, more preferably 0.5-1.0% by weight.<br>
Processing<br>
The granule of the present invention may be prepared by mixing the components in a high speed mixer/granulator. Suitable apparatus is described in EP-A-0340013, EP-A-0367339, EP-A-0390251 and EP-A-0420317.  The components may be added into the mixer/granulator in any suitable order.  Liquid, such as water, may be added to the mixer to act as a granulating agent if necessary.<br>
Laundry Detergent Compositions<br>
The granule of the present invention comprising rebuild agent may be included, according to the third_aspect of the invention, in a granular detergent composition.  The granule, of the present invention is suitably mixed.with the first granule at a weight ratio in the range 200:1 to 20:1, more preferably 100:1 to 50:1.  The granule of the present invention may be included at such a level as to give an overall content of fabric rebuild agent in the detergent composition in the range 0,01% to 10%, more preferably 0.25% to 2.3%.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are preferably laundry compositions, especially main wash (fabric washing; comoositions.<br><br>
The detergent compositions of the invention contain a surface-active compound (surfactant) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, non-ionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>

Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and SP 420 317A (Unilever).<br><br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by way of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:  Preparation of Cellulose "Monoaeetate" This was prepared by the methods of WO 91/16359 Example la<br>
30.0 g of cellulose diacetate (DS 2.45) (the starting cellulose ester), 0.08 g of molybdenum carbonyl (catalyst), 213.6 g of methanol (reactive solvent 1) and 30.0 g of water (reactive solvent 2) are loaded into a 1-litre, steel Parr reactor equipped with a magnetically coupled agitator. The reactor is sealed, then heated to 140°C. 'The heat-up time is typically 1 to 2 hours.  The initial pressure in the reactor is typically 200 500 psi (1379 3447 kPa) nitrogen. The reaction mixture is stirred at 140°C for 7 hours. Then the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, which typically takes 2 to 3 hours. The products are isolated by filtration of the resulting slurry.  The reactive solvent, as well as by-products such as methyl acetate, can be recovered from the filtrate by distillation. The product is cellulose monoaeetate and the yield is 66%. The key analyses are: DS = 0.48; intrinsic viscosity (0.25 g per 100 ml of DMSO) = 0.55.<br><br>
Example lb<br>
30.0 g of cellulose diacetate (DS 2.45) (the starting cellulose ester), 0.05 g of molybdenum (VI) oxide and 237.3 g of methanol (reactive solvent) are loaded into a 1-litre, steel Parr reactor equipped with a magnetically coupled agitator. The reactor is sealed, then heated to 155°C.  The heat-up time is typically 1 to 2 hours.  The initial pressure in the reactor is typically 200 500 psi (137S 3447 kPa) nitrogen.  The reaction mixture is stirred at 153°C for 3 hours. Then the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, which typically takes 2 to 3 hours. The products are isolated by filtration of the resulting slurry. The reactive solvent, as well as certain by-products such as methyl acetate ,can be recovered from the filtrate by distillation. The product is cellulose monoacetate and the yield is 87%. The key analyses are: DS = 0.50; intrinsic viscosity (0.25 g per 100 ml of DMSO) = 1.16.<br>
Example 2:  Preparation of cellulose hemisuccinate (first route)<br>
Cellulose hemisuccinate was prepared following B.P. 410,125. A mixture of cellulose (Whatman cellulose powder CF11 which is cotton, 5g), succinic anhydride (25 g), and pyridine (75 ml) was kept at 65°C for a week.  On pouring into methanol the pyridinium salt of cellulose hemisuccinate was obtained. The crude cellulose hemisuccinate, pyridinium salt, was<br><br>
washed repeatedly with methanol to remove pyridine and unused reactants.  The pyridinium salt of cellulose hemisuccinate was converted to the free acid form by driving off the pyridine under vacuum at 
Infrared spectra of reagents and products were recorded on a Bio-Rad FTS-7 infrared spectrometer using a Graseby Specac (Part #10500) Single Reflection Diamond ATR attachment.<br>
The degree of substitution of cellulose hemisuccinate prepared from cotton fibres was determined by a one-step neutralisation of the carboxylic acid groups and hydrolysis of the ester groups, using an excess of sodium hydroxide, followed by titration of the excess sodium hydroxide with a standard solution of hydrochloric acid, using phenolphthalein as an indicator.  The figure thus obtained was 2.8.<br>
The infrared spectrum of the product in its neutralised, sodium salt form, has two distinct bands attributable to the stretching of C=0. The band at 1574 cm'1 is attributable to carboxylate anion, a band for which is expected at 1550-1610 cm'1. It is therefore reasonable, to attribute the other band at 1727 cm"1 to ester, a band for which is expected at 1735 -1750cm"1. The infrared spectrum is therefore consistent with a hemiester salt.<br>
Example 3;  Preparation of cellulose hemisuccinate (route 2)<br>
Cellulose hemisuccinate was prepared following GB-A-410,125. A mixture of cellulose (Avicel PH105, 5g), succinic anhydride (25 g), and pyridine (75 ml) was kept at 65°C fcr<br><br>
a week.  On pouring into methanol the pyridinium salt of cellulose hemisuccinate was obtained.  The crude cellulose hemisuccinate, pyridinium sal", was washed repeatedly with methanol to remove pyridine and unused reactants.<br>
When this gel was mixed with dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, it did not immediately dissolve but remained as lumps, but it did slowly dissolve to form a near-optically-clear solution. The fact that the methanol-washed cellulose hemisuccinate was not immediately soluble in dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide indicated that the cellulose hemisuccinate was slightly cross linked.<br>
The methanol-rinsed cellulose hemisuccinate was used to prepare a cellulose hemisuccinate having a lower degree of substitution and with fewer cross links which was water dispersable.<br>
A homogeneous solution was prepared by partially hydrolysing the cellulose hemisuccinate as follows.  Cellulose hemisuccinate prepared from microcrystalline cellulose, in the form of a gel of cellulose hemisuccinate, pyridinium salt, dispersed in methanol, was added to 50 ml of stirred Q.l M NaCl solution at 50 °C.  0.1 M NaOH solution was added until the pH was raised to -7.0 (18.0 ml was required). More 0.1K NaOH solution was added until the pH was raised to -10.5 (3.0 ml was required).  This pH was then maintained for 45 minutes by further additions of 0.1 M NaOH solution (4.2 ml was required).  The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and neutralised using 1.0 M HC1 (0.13 ml was required).  After this procedure the solution was only<br><br>
slightly turbid.  The polymer was separated fron inorganic salts by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Inc.) employing a cellulose triacetate membrane with a molecular weight cut¬off of 20,000 (Sartorious SM 145 39).<br>
The degree of substitution of cellulose hemisuccinate prepared from by this route was determined by a one-step neutralisation of the carboxylic acid groups and hydrolysis of the ester groups, using an excess of sodium hydroxide, followed by titration of the excess sodium hydroxide with a standard solution of hydrochloric acid, using phsnolphthalein as an indicator.  The figure thus obtained was 2.0.<br>
Example 4;  Preparation of cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propanoate<br>
Following the method described in DE 3,322,118 a mixture of 2.33 g lactide (3,6-dimethyl-l,4-dioxane-2,5-dione) and 29.7 g of cellulose solution (obtained by dissolving 14 g of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH105) swollen with 14 g of N,W-dimethylacetamide in a mixture of 2 00 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide and 25.3 g of lithium chloride) was treated with 1.5 ml of triethyl amine and stirred at 7S°C for 1.5 hours.<br>
Cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propanoate was isolaced by pipetting the reaction mixture into 300 mi of methanol. The product gel was washed with a further two batches of 300 ml of methanol.  At this stage the methanol-swollen 2-(2-hycroxy-1-oxcpropcxy)propanoate was water soluble.<br><br>
