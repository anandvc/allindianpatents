Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring the frequency of a<br>
received signal. The present invention also relates to an apparatus for measuring<br>
the frequency of a received signal. It can be applied to a frequency counter.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There exists a need to analyse a received signal in a given frequency band and<br>
determine the frequency of a signal present at a particular frequency within the<br>
band. This is generally known as frequency measurement.<br>
A device known as a Delay Line Correlator can be used for frequency<br>
measurement. However, a Delay Line Correlator is implemented entirely by<br>
analogue components and consequently can be expensive to manufacture. It also<br>
has relatively high power consumption requirements and often has a large<br>
physical volume.<br>
The delay line correlator operates by comparing the phase of a received signal<br>
with a delayed version of the signal. Mixers are used to determine the frequency<br>
of the signal depending on the result of the comparison.<br>
Digital frequency measurement devices have also been proposed. These apply<br>
signal processing techniques such as fourier transforms to a sampled version of<br>
the received signal to derive the frequency of the received signal.<br>
In a wideband digital frequency measurement device short pulses are typically<br>
analysed over a large dynamic range. However this requires complex analogue-<br>
to-digital converters (ADCs) and a large amount of processing to cope with the<br>
frequency range, which may have an upper limit of 2GHz or more.<br><br>
In a narrowband digital device, a heterodyne is used to achieve increased<br>
resolution and sensitivity with reduced complexity in the ADC and processor.<br>
However such a device can only cover a narrow frequency band and therefore<br>
cannot cover wideband of interest (such as 0.5 to 2 GHz) simultaneously.<br>
EP 1450170 (Anritsu) discloses a method of measuring the frequency of a<br>
received signal comprising the steps of generating a first phase signal by<br>
digitising the phase of the received signal, delaying the first phase signal by a<br>
predetermined amount to generate a second phase signal; calculating the phase<br>
difference between the first and second phase signals; and, calculating the<br>
frequency of the input signal from the phase difference.<br>
EP 0373802 (Thorn EMI PLC) discloses a method of frequency measurement.<br>
The method comprises making a high resolution n bit measurement and then<br>
derives the frequency from the measurement by means of a best fit line<br>
In view of the above, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved<br>
method and apparatus for measuring frequency using digital components.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
measuring the frequency of a received signal comprising the steps of:<br>
generating a first phase signal by digitising the phase of the received<br>
signal;<br>
delaying the first phase signal by a predetermined amount to generate a second<br>
phase signal;<br>
calculating a phase difference between the first and the second phase<br>
signals; and,<br>
calculating the frequency of the input signal from the phase difference.<br><br>
The predetermined amount of delay preferably corresponds to an integer multiple<br>
of the length of one sampling period used when generating the first phase signal.<br>
This allows digital components to be used to execute the method without<br>
requiring expensive digitisation and processing. Unlike prior digital methods, the<br>
method does not use signal processing techniques such as Fourier transforms.<br>
Unlike prior analogue methods, the method can be implemented without the need<br>
for mixers (or their digital equivalent of multipliers) in the calculation of the<br>
phase difference, reducing complexity.<br>
Preferably, the stuff of generating a first phase signal comprises:<br>
splitting the received signal into in-phase and quadrature components,<br>
thereby generating a received in-phase signal and received quadrature signal;<br>
digitising the received in-phase signal thereby generating a digitised<br>
received in-phase signal;<br>
digitising the received quadrature signal thereby generating a digitised<br>
received quadrature signal; and<br>
generating a first phase signal from the digitised received in-phase signal<br>
and the digitised received quadrature signal.<br>
This allows the phase of the received signal to be digitised using standard<br>
components. The combination of the in-phase and quadrature signal together<br>
represent the signal in complex format and allow the phase to be derived.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises limiting the amplitude of the signal<br>
prior to the step of splitting the received signal into in phase and quadrature<br>
components.<br>
By limiting the amplitude, the resolution required to digitised signal can be<br>
reduced.<br><br>
Preferably, the steps of digitising use a one-bit resolution, such that the digitised<br>
received in-phase signal and the digitised received quadrature signal each<br>
comprise a succession of single bits representing signal value at a particular<br>
instant in time.<br>
By using a one-bit resolution, so that each sample has only two possible values<br>
the processing requirements can be further reduced.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises de-serialising the succession of single<br>
bits of the digitised received in-phase signal and the digitised received quadrature<br>
signal into words having a predetermined number of bits.<br>
If the succession of single bit samples is grouped together into words having a<br>
predetermined number of bits, these words can then be processed at a lower<br>
clock speed thereby allowing the use of a processor with a lower clock speed.<br>
Advantageously, the predetermined number can correspond to the internal word<br>
length used when processing. Likewise, the predetermined number can be of the<br>
form 2° where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises:<br>
converting the phase difference into an in-phase and quadrature<br>
components, thereby generating a phase difference in-phase signal and a phase<br>
difference quadrature signal;<br>
filtering the phase difference in-phase signal thereby generating a filtered<br>
phase difference in-phase signal;<br>
filtering the phase difference quadrature signal thereby generating a<br>
filtered phase difference quadrature signal;<br><br>
generating a filtered phase difference signal from the filtered phase<br>
difference in-phase signal and the filtered phase difference quadrature signal;<br>
and,<br>
using the filtered phase difference signal in the step of calculating the<br>
frequency of the received signal.<br>
By filtering the signal the effective resolution can be increased. This allows a<br>
lower sampling resolution to be used while still achieving good resolution.<br>
In one embodiment, filter is a moving average filter.<br>
Preferably, the step of calculating the frequency of the receive signal uses the<br>
formula:<br><br>
Where f is the frequency of the receive signal, Fs is the sampling frequency used<br>
when digitising the signal, and d is the predetermined amount of delay used in<br>
the step of delaying expressed as a number of sample periods.<br>
This formula can be implemented in a simple manner without requiring complex<br>
processing.<br>
Preferably, the method is executed at least twice using a different value for the<br>
predetermined amount of delay in the step of delaying.<br>
By implementing the method more than once with a different value for the delay,<br>
cyclic (or ambiguous) frequencies can have their frequency correctly identified.<br><br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
apparatus for measuring the frequency of received signal, the apparatus<br>
comprising:<br>
digitisation means for digitising the phase of the receive signal and<br>
generating a first phase signal;<br>
delay means for delaying the first phase signal by a predetermined<br>
amount to generate a second phase signal; and,<br>
processing means for calculating a phase difference between the first and<br>
the second phase signals and for calculating the frequency of the received signal<br>
from the phase difference.<br>
Thus, the method of the first aspect can be implemented without requiring<br>
expensive specialist hardware.<br>
Preferably, the digitisation means comprises:<br>
a signal splitter for splitting the received signal into in-phase and<br>
quadrature components, thereby generating a received in-phase signal and a<br>
received quadrature signal;<br>
a first analogue-to-digital converter for digitising the received in-phase<br>
signal thereby generating a digitised received in-phase signal;<br>
a second analog-to-digital converter for digitising the received quadrature<br>
signal thereby generating a digitised received quadrature signal; and<br>
means for resolving the phase of the received signal from the digitised<br>
received in-phase signal and the digitised received quadrature signal and for<br>
outputting the first phase signal.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus further comprises a limiting amplifier connected to the<br>
input of the signal splitter.<br><br>
Preferably, the first and second analog-to-digital converters are single bit<br>
devices, preferably comparators.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus further comprises a first deserialiser connected to the<br>
output of the first analogue to digital converter for deserialising the output from<br>
the first analogue-to-digital converter and for outputting words having a<br>
predetermined number of bits; and,<br>
a second deserialiser connected to the output of the first analogue to<br>
digital converter for deserialising the output from the second analog-to-digital<br>
converter and for outputting words having a predetermined number of bits.<br>
Deserialiser is used to refer to any device which can convert a serial bitstream<br>
into a parallel bitstream of a given word length.<br>
Preferably, the processing means further comprises:<br>
means for converting the phase difference into in-phase and quadrature<br>
components, thereby generating a phase difference in-phase signal and a phase<br>
difference quadrature signal;<br>
a first digital filter for filtering the phase difference in-phase signal<br>
thereby generating a filtered phase difference in-phase signal;<br>
a second digital filter for filtering the phase difference quadrature signal<br>
thereby generating a filtered phase difference quadrature signal; and<br>
means for generating a filtered phase difference signal from the filtered<br>
phase difference in-phase signal and the filtered phase difference quadrature<br>
signal;<br>
wherein the filtered phase difference signal is used in the calculation of<br>
the frequency of the received signal.<br>
Preferably, the first and second digital filters are moving average filters.<br><br>
Preferably, the processing means is adapted to calculate the frequency using the<br>
formula:<br><br>
Where f is the frequency of the received signal, Fs is the sampling frequency used<br>
by the analogue-to-digital converters the signal, and d is the predetermined<br>
amount of delay used in the step of delaying expressed as a number of sample<br>
periods.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus further comprises at least two delay means each of<br>
which delays the signal by a different amount.<br>
Preferably, the delay means and the processing means are implemented in a Field<br>
Programmable Gate Array.<br>
A Field Programmable Gate Array is a standard component which can be<br>
programmed at the point of manufacture to operate in a particular way. It<br>
therefore allows a cost-effective implementation of the invention.<br>
Other devices such as programmable DSP or microprocessor could also be used<br>
for the processing means.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of a frequency measurement receiver according<br>
to a first embodiment of the present invention;<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts a block diagram of the processing to calculate a received<br>
frequency according to the first embodiment;<br>
Figures 3A, 3B and 3C illustrate the incidence of quantisation noise in the first<br>
embodiment;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the simulated performance of the first embodiment; and<br>
The figure 5 depicts a block diagram of a second exemplary embodiment.<br>
According to a first embodiment, an apparatus (or receiver) for frequency<br>
measurement performs a frequency discrimination by measuring the differential<br>
phase between two time-separated versions of an input signal. Unlike an<br>
analogue delay line correlator, the input signal is digitised, and phase<br>
discrimination subsequently performed in the digital domain using high-speed<br>
Field Programmable Gate Array. A block diagram of the receiver according to<br>
this embodiment is shown in figure 1.<br>
Referring to figure 1, in general terms a limiting amplifier 2 compresses the input<br>
signal dynamic range such as a pair of high-speed comparators 4 and 6 can<br>
perform I-Q phase digitisation. The high-speed comparators operate at a<br>
sampling frequency Fs. This generates two serial data streams In and Q„ which<br>
are then fed into 1:16 deserialisers 8 and 10 which produced 16-bit words (Im and<br>
Qm) at 1/16th of the sampling frequency. All subsequent processing is performed<br>
by an FPGA at this reduced rate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A more detailed description of each component of figure 1 will now follow.<br><br>
The use of a limiting amplifier 2 strips all amplitude information from the input<br>
signal and therefore the digital correlation receiver is only able to process one<br>
pulse at a time. The limiting amplifier 2 is connected to an I-Q generator 3.<br>
The I-Q generator 3 is used because a complex representation of the input signal<br>
is required. In this embodiment the I-Q generator 3 is either a distributed or a<br>
lumped-element realisation of a quadrature hybrid. Only a single hybrid is<br>
required and thus tracking errors introduced by multiple distributed element<br>
components are eliminated.<br>
The output of the I-Q generator 3 is connected to the high-speed comparators 4<br>
and 6. A clock 5 controls the sampling frequency and operates at a rate greater<br>
than the bandwidth of the input signal. The high-speed comparators 4 and 6 must<br>
also be capable of tracking analogue signals in the band of interest. Providing the<br>
latter requirement is met, sub-Nyquist sampling can be implemented and any<br>
band (of width Fs Hz) can be analysed without ambiguity. Thus, for example, to<br>
analyse a band of 0.5 to 2 GHz sampling frequency of 2GHz is required. In this<br>
embodiment a sampling frequency of 2GHz is used. The high-speed comparators<br>
4 and 6 produce an output of a bitstream of successive single-bit sample values at<br>
the sampling frequency; signals In and Qn respectively.<br>
The output of the high-speed comparators 4 and 6 is connected to the<br>
deserialisers 8 and 10 respectively. These reduce the data rate of the data streams<br>
I„ and Qn by combining several successive bits into longer length words output at<br>
a slower rate. This allows the signal to be processed at a slower rate than the<br>
sampling rate. Deserialisers operating at 2.5 gigabits per second are readily<br>
available and may also provide appropriately divided clocks as an output. In this<br>
embodiment the deserialisers 8 and 10 output data words having a length of 16<br>
bits. The data streams of these 16-bit words are indicated in figure 1 by Im and<br>
Qm.<br><br>
Careful phase alignment of the deserialisers 8 and 10 is required. This is<br>
performed at power-up to ensure proper operation of the receiver.<br>
The signals Im and Qm are provided to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)<br>
12. The FPGA 12 processes the signals Im and Qm using a clock frequency equal<br>
to 1/16* that of the clock 5 because each 16-bit word contain 16 samples. Thus,<br>
it also produces updated frequency data 18 at a rate of Fs/16. In order to supply <br>
the correct clock frequency to the FPGA 12, a divider 14 divides the signal from<br>
the clock 5 by 16 for supply to the FPGA 12. Therefore, in this embodiment, the <br>
FPGA is clock at 125Mz.<br>
Although in this embodiment the frequency discrimination is performed in a<br>
continuously clocked fashion, asynchronous triggered operation is possible in<br>
alternative embodiments due to the relatively high processing rate of me FPGA.<br>
The processing carried out by the FPGA 12 will now be described. A block<br>
diagram showing the processing required is depicted in figure 2.<br>
The use of single bit comparators 4 and 6 results in the two digitised signals Im<br>
and Qm effectively resolving the phase of the input signal into four states. As<br>
depicted in figure 2A the phase φ can be resolved into any of the states 20, 22,<br>
24, 26. The phase φ is resolved by the block 27. The quantised phase<br>
representation φ is delayed by a number of sample clock cycles in the delay<br>
block 28. The phase difference between the undelayed and the delayed signals is<br>
then calculated in block 30, producing a two-bit, low resolution estimate of the <br>
differential phase Acp. (Once again, this is resolved into four possible states). This<br>
estimate is converted to IQ format by block 32 to produce signals ΔI and ΔQ.<br><br>
The signals ΔI and ΔQ are then filtered by filters 34 and 36. This has the<br>
beneficial result of increasing the resolution of the phase estimate, and an<br>
improved differential phase estimate Δφ' is generated by resolving the phase<br>
from the filtered signals ΔI' and ΔQ' in block 38. In this embodiment the filters<br>
34 and 36 are both moving average filters, although other filter types could also<br>
be used.<br>
The frequency, f, of the input signal can be derived by block 40 from the<br>
differential phase estimate Δφ' as follows:<br><br>
Where d is the number of sample delays in the delay block 28, and Fs is input<br>
sample rate. Improved resolution can be achieved by increasing the delay in<br>
delay block 28. Cyclic (and therefore ambiguous) frequency estimates can be<br>
resolved by using multiple correlators each using varying delays. All correlators<br>
are implemented within a single FPGA , unlike prior proposed frequency<br>
measurement apparatus, and therefore an extremely compact solution is realised.<br>
In this embodiment the correlation process uses the principle of over-sampling an<br>
input signal using low-bit resolution sampling devices (the high-speed<br>
comparators 4 and 6). The digital data is subsequently filtered to reduce the<br>
quantisation noise introduced during the sampling process.<br>
The performance of the system will now be discussed, particularly in relation to<br>
the noise introduced.<br>
The quantisation noise introduced during the digitisation process in the high-<br>
speed comparators 4 and 6 is of the same order as the noise present in the input<br>
signal when the correlator operates in poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)<br><br>
environments. Both the noise present in the input signal and the quantisation<br>
noise contribute to the output noise and as a result define the frequency accuracy<br>
performance of the apparatus. An analysis of both these noise components is<br>
given below.<br>
Figure 3A depicts the four states into which the phase of the signal can be<br>
resolved. Figure 3B illustrates how the quantisation noise changes, as the<br>
absolute phase φ of the input signal is resolved into one of the four phase states<br>
depicted in figure 3A. Assuming the quantisation noise samples are statistically<br>
independent (i.e. uncorrelated with the sample clock and with each other), the<br>
noise is uniformly distributed as shown in figure 3C and can be shown to have a<br>
standard deviation or RMS value of<br><br>
Using standard phase noise theory, the phase noise at the output of a phase<br>
detector for a given SNR, S is:<br><br>
These two noise components, Gqnoise and oSnoisc are statistically independent; noise<br>
present at the output of the phase discriminator (before filtering by filters 34 and<br>
36) is therefore:<br><br>
In this embodiment the filters 34 and 36 are moving average filters, which is<br>
optimal for this embodiment. The filters 34 and 36 average N adjacent samples<br>
are averaged, reducing the RMS noise by VN. In this embodiment the value of N<br>
is 64 and therefore the RMS noise is reduced by a factor of 8. Different values of<br>
N may also be used.<br><br>
The assumption in the calculations above that successive quantisation noise<br>
samples are uncorrected is vital for all but a few cases of input frequencies (and<br>
phase relative to the sample clock). It can be shown mat within four bands of<br>
input signal frequency defined by:<br><br>
Where N is the order of the filter, Fs is the sample rate and k is an integer k=1..4;<br>
quantisation noise samples are correlated resulting in a localised loss of<br>
sensitivity. In practice, system noise will tend to de-correlate this noise therefore<br>
reducing its effect.<br>
A specific example of a hardware implementation of this embodiment will now<br>
be described. This example hardware implementation has the following target<br>
specification and performance attributes:<br>
•	The sample rate is 2 Gsps, with an unambiguous bandwidth of 2GHz<br>
•	125 MHz correlator processing rate<br>
•	50ns pulse-width capability<br>
•	7-bit resolution for each discriminator<br>
•	4-correlators are used in the designed to give a robust solution<br>
•	there is 125MHz unambiguous bandwidth for a 'fine discriminator',<br>
resulting in an approximately 1MHz resolution<br>
•	measurement delay: 120ns<br>
A VHDL design of this embodiment has been implemented and full timing<br>
driven gate level simulations performed. The results of the simulation of a single<br>
correlator are shown in figure 4.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows the RMS phase error for different input SNR conditions for two<br>
digital delay correlator sample delays; a 1 sample delay (curve 50) and a 16-<br>
sample delay (curve 52). The theoretical performance is also shown as curve 54,<br>
which is calculated from equation (4). It is clear that the simulation performs<br>
better than the theory suggests. It is thought that the improved performance is a<br>
result of in-phase correlation effects experienced in phase discriminator<br>
correlator designs. The fact that the short delay design appears to perform better<br>
man the long delay correlator supports this assumption.<br>
It is possible to estimate the frequency accuracy performance of the design for a<br>
given input SNR thus:<br>
The 16 sample delay 'fine discriminator'(with performance depicted by curve<br>
52) defines the frequency accuracy. This will have an unambiguous bandwidth of<br>
2GHz/16 =125 MHz. From figure 4, the RMS phase error for 3dB SNR is<br>
approximately 5°. The frequency error is therefore 5/360*125 = 1.7MHz RMS.<br>
The design described above was targeted towards FPGAs which are<br>
commercially available from Xilinix is sold under the mark Spartan-3. These are<br>
low-cost, high performance parts. These devices also have a large amount of on-<br>
board memory, which can be used as fast look-up-tables carrying calibration data<br>
to overcome non-ideal behaviour of the analogue components.<br>
A four-correlator design when targeted to an XC3S400 device (which is a<br>
member of the Xilinix Spartan-3 family) uses less than 12 % of the available<br>
logic resources. Gate-level timing simulations show that this design can be<br>
clocked at over 150MHz (as opposed to thel25MHz required). This margin can<br>
be exploited by reducing the amount of pipelining used in the design to decrease<br>
the measurement delay, or indeed the system clock rate could be increased to<br>
improve the resolution {i.e. increase the over-sampling rate).<br><br>
Simulation results state that the power dissipation of the FPGA design is around<br>
1.2W. Dissipation of other components such as the de-serialisers, digitizers and<br>
limiting amplifier suggest that the dissipation of the complete receiver would be<br>
around 3.3W. This is approximately one third of that typically dissipated by<br>
existing analogue frequency measurement devices. Furthermore, a double-sided<br>
PCB design can be realised with approximate the mentions of 100*100*15 mm<br>
which is a quarter of the volume occupied by existing 2-18GHz analogue<br>
frequency measurement devices.<br>
Figure 5 depicts a block diagram of a second embodiment of the invention. It<br>
shows how a static microwave frequency divider could be used to implement a<br>
compact 2-18GHz receiver.<br>
The embodiment uses two limiting amplifier 60 and 62. Limiting amplifier 62 is<br>
operative for frequencies in the range 0.5 to 2GHz and limiting amplifier 60 is<br>
operative for frequencies in the range 2 to 18GHz. The output of limiting<br>
amplifier 60 is connected to a prescaler 64 which divides by 8 and produces an<br>
output in the range 0.25 to 2.25 GHz.<br>
A multi-octave I-Q generator 66 generates an in-phase and quadrature<br>
component signals to supply to the digital correlator 68.<br>
The multi-octave I-Q generator 66 could be implemented digitally using high-<br>
speed flip-flops and absorbed into the frequency division operation, this would<br>
provide for an extremely robust receiver design with 'zero' alignment.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the in-phase and quadrature signals are digitised<br>
with a resolution higher than one bit.<br><br>
