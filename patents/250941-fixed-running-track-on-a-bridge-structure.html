3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The present invention concerns a rigid track on a bridge construction in which a concrete slab is positioned on a bridge girder in order to support a rail for a railway vehicle.<br>
Rigid tracks are usually used for high-speed sections of railway track. This involves the creation of a concrete strip, consisting either of prefabricated concrete plates joined together or of individual sleepers bonded together by site-mixed concrete. The rigid track here is aligned and fastened by a hydraulically bonded subbase. This forms an almost endless, continuous concrete strip on which the rails for the railway are mounted. This strip is, however, interrupted in the region of bridges, in order to avoid relative movements between the bridge girders and the concrete slabs of the rigid track. In this case the concrete slabs are laid in such a way as to correspond to the lengths of the bridge girders. The concrete strip is also interrupted at the place where two bridge girders meet, so that the expansion of the bridge girder can be transferred directly to the concrete slabs of the rigid track, thus avoiding unacceptable warping in the composite system of the bridge girder and the concrete slab. A disadvantage of mounting the rigid track on a bridge construction in this way is that the lengths of the concrete slabs must match the lengths of the bridge girders. It is therefore necessary, particularly when prefabricated concrete slabs are used, for special lengths of these prefabricated concrete slabs to be manufactured, allowing them to be matched to the lengths of the bridge girders. A further disadvantage is that expansion joints are provided in the rigid track just as on the bridge girders, and this can necessitate an expensive rail structure.<br>
The task of the present invention is therefore to provide a rigid track on a bridge construction that is independent of the length of the individual bridge girders, and which, moreover, can be manufactured economically.<br><br><br>
The present invention fulfils this task with a rigid track on a bridge construction having the characteristics of Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, the concrete slab of the rigid track forms a strip that is continuous over at least two bridge girders. The expansion joint between the two bridge girders is thus irrelevant to the path of the concrete strip. Because of the high mass of the bridge girder in comparison with the concrete slab, and because of the direction of incoming thermal radiation, the concrete slab is subject to much higher levels of thermal expansion than the bridge girder itself, and the thermal expansion of the bridge girder is significantly slower than that of the concrete slab, for which reason a structure is provided according to the invention that makes the bridge girder independent of the strip of concrete slabs. This structure incorporates a profiled concrete layer between the concrete slab and the bridge girder. The profiled concrete layer is, like the strip of concrete slabs, continuous in structure. A sliding layer is incorporated between the profiled concrete layer and the bridge girder, while the profiled concrete layer is permanently bonded to the rigid track. This allows the concrete slab and a profiled concrete layer to slide on the bridge girder. The thermal expansions can thereby take place largely independently. The profiled concrete layer performs the function of the conventional, hydraulically bonded subbase on which the concrete slab is built. Whereas, however, the hydraulically bonded subbase is tightly bonded to the ground, the profiled concrete layer can slide on the bridge girder, and bridges the expansion joints between the individual bridge girders. A rigid track is thereby created of the type that can be constructed continuously and without interruption even in the region of bridges. Rail alignment in order to bridge over joints is no longer necessary. This means that the rigid track can be manufactured economically, and is more convenient than before in operation.<br><br><br>
In a favourable embodiment of the rigid track according to the invention, the bridge girder is supported by a fixed bearing and a movable bearing, and the profiled concrete layer is rigidly bonded to it in the area of the fixed bearing of the bridge girder. As a result, the different expansions of the rigid track and the profiled concrete layer as against the bridge girder exhibit the favourable feature that the expansions necessarily take place in substantially the same direction. The relative movements of the two units thereby remain relatively small.<br>
It is particularly favourable if the rigid connection of the bridge girder and the profiled concrete layer is achieved through connecting elements such as tie-bolts, particularly screw-in tie-bolts, bow reinforcements or plugs that may, for instance, protrude from the bridge girder and onto which the profiling concrete layer is formed. It is particularly favourable here if the tie-bolts are screw-in tie-bolts, and if they are not screwed in into the bridge girder until immediately before the profiled concrete layer is formed. This permits the bridge girder to be used to carry construction vehicles before the profiled concrete layer is poured without damaging the tie-bolts.<br>
A particular advantage is provided by the use of a resilient layer, such as a layer of high-resistance foam or a layer of elastomer in the region where two bridge girders meet, positioned between the bridge girders and the profiled concrete layer. Because the individual bridge girders are independent of one another, whereas the profiled concrete layer and the concrete slab, in contrast, extend as a continuous strip over the expansion joints in the bridge girders, the two units have different elastic lines. Each of the bridge girders flexes in the form of a bow, whereas the concrete slabs and the profiled concrete layer extend over the individual bridge girders in the form of a wave. The layer of high-resistance foam is provided in order to avoid the development of excessive stresses in the area between two bridge girders. In extreme cases, the ends of the bridge girders can move in and out of the resilient layer without ex-<br><br><br>
erting excessive pressure on the profiled concrete layer and the concrete slab. This reduces the stress on the continuous strip. The resilient layer thus represents a particularly favourable element of the present structure. The resilient layer can, for instance, be a layer of high-resistance foam laid in the form of high-resistance foam sheets on the bridge girder prior to pouring the profiled concrete layer. In this way shuttering is, at the same time, provided for the profiled concrete layer in the region where two neighbouring bridge girders meet with a space between them.<br>
If a bolster plate is positioned on the resilient layer facing the profiled concrete layer, the reinforcement for the profiled concrete layer can be placed on this bolster plate prior to and during the pouring of the concrete without damaging the resilient layer or being concreted into the profiled concrete layer in an undefined manner.<br>
If the bridge girder incorporates an indentation to partially hold the resilient layer, then on the one hand the position of the high-resistance foam on the bridge girder is defined, while on the other hand the profiled concrete layer in the region of the resilient layer is not significantly weakened. The height of the profiled concrete layer in the region of the transition between two bridge girders is thereby almost the same as the thickness in other parts of the profiled concrete layer.<br>
Although the concrete slab of the rigid track is bonded essentially rigidly to the profiled concrete layer, usually by non-positive connexion, particularly high stability is achieved if, in the region where two bridge girders meet, the concrete slab of the rigid track is bonded to the profiled concrete layer with positive interlock. This positively interlocking joint can be made particularly easily by bolting the concrete slab to the profiled concrete layer. Screw-in tie-bolts, reinforcing hoops, or subsequently drilled and cast pegs can also be used.<br><br><br>
The sliding layer between the profiled concrete layer and the bridge girder is favourably manufactured from a membrane and/or a geotextile. The use of two membranes lying on top of one another, and therefore definitively able to slide past one another, is also favourable. The geotextile has the advantage that it is at least partially impregnated by concrete, and therefore bonds very well to the concrete. Un-evenness in the bridge girder can be compensated for by the geotextile, which can have a thickness of 2 - 10 mm. This makes it significantly easier for the profiled concrete layer to slide on the bridge girder. Distortion can thus be largely avoided. A layer of geotextile can, for this purpose, be positioned on the bridge girder and/or on the side of the profiled concrete layer that faces the bridge girder, and can have one or two membranes, such as polyethylene membranes with a thickness of about 0.3 - 0.5 mm, in between.<br>
It is particularly favourable for the invention if the concrete slab consists of individual prefabricated concrete slabs that are joined together to form a continuous strip. This can, for instance, be done in a conventional manner as is known from the "Feste Fahrbahn - Bogl" system. Alternatively, the invention can, of course, also be applied to a rigid track consisting of prefabricated slabs that are not coupled together, or of sleepers cast in site-mixed concrete.<br>
In a particularly favourable embodiment, the prefabricated concrete slabs may comprise standard parts of the usual length, laid without reference to the locations where the bridge girders meet. Because the prefabricated concrete slabs are laid on top of the profiled concrete layer, which forms a continuous strip, it is not necessary to consider the meeting points between the bridge girders when laying the prefabricated concrete slabs. The continuous strip formed by the profiled concrete layer slides on the bridge girders together with the strip of prefabricated concrete slabs that constitute the rigid track.<br><br><br>
In addition to the advantages described above, the profiled concrete layer offers the further benefit that the path of the rigid track can be guided by the profiled concrete layer. In particular, raising the rail, for instance in curved sections, can be shaped with the aid of the profiled concrete layer. The same version of the concrete slabs, in particular the prefabricated concrete slabs, can be laid throughout. Special dimensions for prefabricated concrete slabs are, in most cases, not necessary.<br>
The profiled concrete layer is reinforced in order to make it stable and able to absorb both compressive and tensile stress arising as a result of thermal expansion and as a result of the acceleration forces acting on the rail vehicles.<br>
In order, in particular, to stop the profiled concrete layer and the rigid track from breaking away sideways, stoppers are located on the bridge girders to maintain the lateral position of the profiled concrete layer and/or of the concrete slabs of the rigid track. The stoppers permit relative movement of the profiled concrete layer and/or of the concrete slabs in the longitudinal direction of the rails. Sideways movement of the profiled concrete layer and/ or of the concrete slabs on the bridge girders is avoided by the stoppers that are located on both sides of the profiled concrete layer and/or of the concrete slabs.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are described in the following embodiments. They show:<br>
Figure 1        a longitudinal section through a rigid track on a bridge structure in the region where to bridge girders meet;<br>
Figure 2        a view from above onto a rigid track in an area similar to that of Figure 1;<br><br><br>
Figure 3        a cross-section through a bridge girder and<br>
Figure 4        a section showing a detailed view of the sliding layer.<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through a rigid track 1 in the region 12 where two bridge girders 2 meet. In this embodiment, the rigid track is formed from concrete slabs 3 that are joined rigidly where they butt together 4, and thereby constituting a continuous strip. The connection of the individual concrete slabs 3 where they butt together 4 can be created conventionally with the aid of prestressing steel and by pouring concrete into the gap at the joint 4. Rails 6 are laid on rail support points 5 on the rigid track 1.<br>
The concrete slabs 3 are positioned on a profiled concrete layer 7. This can be achieved, for instance, by adjusting the position of the concrete slabs 3 on the profiled concrete layer 7 by means of spindles, and then fixing it in place with cast concrete between the concrete slab 3 and the profiled concrete layer 4. The profiled concrete layer 7 thus provides a solid foundation in a constant position for the concrete slabs 3, for permanent laying of the rigid track 1.<br>
A sliding layer 10 is positioned between the profiled concrete layer 7 and the upper side of the bridge girder 2. In order to permit the differing expansions that occur in particular due to solar radiation and to the different masses of the bridge girders 2 and the rigid track 1 with the profiled concrete layer 7, it is particularly favourable if the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 can slide on the bridge girder 2. This avoids the development of unacceptable stresses, creating a very uniform structure, particularly in the region of the rigid track 1, significantly increasing comfort of travel in the trains, whilst on the other hand being relatively economical to manufacture. The joints 4 in the rigid track 1 in this structure no longer have to correspond<br><br><br>
with the meeting points 12 between the bridge girders, as was the case in the past. The rigid track 1 extends over the meeting points 12 in the bridge girders 2 without interruption. The fabrication of the individual concrete slabs 3 can therefore be done in the conventional, standardized way. It is not necessary to consider the particular lengths of the individual bridge girders 2. This structure is of particularly great advantage in comparison with the state of the art on sections of track characterized by a large number of bridges, because the conventional structure requires a large number of concrete slabs 3 made to special lengths.<br>
In the section illustrated here, the bridge girders 2 are positioned on top of a pillar 14. Each is supported on one fixed bearing 15 and one movable bearing 16. This permits the bridge girder 2 to expand from the fixed bearing 15 in the direction of the movable bearing 16 of the same bridge girder 2. The gap at the meeting site 12 therefore becomes larger or smaller as the length of the bridge girder 2 changes. In order for shear forces from the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 to be transferred to the bridge girder 2, tie-bolts 18 are positioned in the area of the fixed bearing 15 of the bridge girder 2, and these join the profiled concrete layer 7 to the bridge girder 2. Thermal expansions of the unit consisting of the profiled concrete layer 7 and the concrete slabs 3 thus take place in the same direction as the bridge girder 2, as a result of which a smaller relative movement between the two units is to be expected.<br>
The tie-bolts 18 are favourably screw-in tie-bolts. This means that threaded sleeves are concreted into the upper side of the bridge girder 2, and the anchors 18 are screwed into them shortly before concreting the profiled concrete layer 7. This has the advantage that during the construction work the upper side of the bridge girder 2 can be used as a track for construction vehicles without damaging the anchors 18, which otherwise would protrude from the upper side of the bridge girder 2.<br><br><br>
Because the bridge girders 2 are not connected together, each girder will sag into the shape of a bow when loaded. In contrast, the movements of the continuous strip of profiling concrete 7 and of the rigid track 1 will rather adopt the shape of a wave. In order to avoid the formation of an unacceptable kink in the continuous strip in the region of the joint 12, a layer of high-resistance foam 20 is positioned on the bridge girders 2 and under the profiled concrete layer 7 in the region of the joints 12. Should any kink develop between two bridge girders 2 in the region of the joint 12, they will therefore not press against the profiled concrete layer 7 but will move into the layer of high-resistance foam 20, compressing the high-resistance foam without exerting unacceptable pressure on the profiled concrete layer 7. The layer of high-resistance foam 20 can consist of high-resistance foam sheets inserted into an indentation in the bridge girder provided for the purpose. A thickness of a few centimetres is usually sufficient for the layer of high-resistance foam 20. It is also sufficient to overlap the joint 12 for a length of 1-2 m in order to compensate for the expected relative movements between the profiled concrete layer 7 and the bridge girder 2 in a vertical direction. The indentation in the upper side of the bridge girder 2 provided to accept the layer of high-resistance foam 20 is favourable for manufacture, as the position of the layer of high-resistance foam 20 is maintained securely while the profiled concrete layer 7 is being poured, but it is not in fact essential for function.<br>
In order to ensure the correct positioning of the reinforcement in the profiled concrete layer 7 while it is being poured, it is favourable if a bolster plate 21 is positioned on the layer of high-resistance foam 20. The bolster plate 21 ensures that the reinforcement does not sink down to the layer of high-resistance foam 20 during concreting, but that it maintains a specified clearance from it. The reinforcement can accordingly be supported by the bolster plate 21, for instance by means of feet positioned on it.<br><br><br>
Pegs 22 are provided in order to ensure that there is a rigid connection between the concrete slabs 3 of the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 in the region of the joint 12. After the rigid track 1 has been laid, they are inserted into the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7, and provide additional security for the connection between the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7, particularly in the region of the joint 12.<br>
Figure 2 shows a view from above of a rigid track 1 on bridge girders 2 in the region of the joint 12 between two bridge girders 2. It can be seen that of the rigid track 1, like the profiled concrete layer 7, constitutes a continuous strip that extends over the joint 12 between two bridge girders 2. The layer of high-resistance foam 20 and the bolster plate 21 are incorporated in the region of the joints 12. The tie-bar 18 and the peg 22 are also provided in this area, in order to create a bond between the profiled concrete layer 7 and the bridge girder 2, and with the rigid track 1. The rails 6 of the track for the railway vehicles are laid on a large number of rail supports 5. Depending on the system used to lay the rails, this can, however, be implemented in a different way. Thus, instead of the discontinuous rail support, continuous support is also possible. It is also possible for the rigid track 1 not to be constructed from prefabricated concrete slabs or from a grid of slabs, but from individual sleepers that support both rails 6 and are connected together by concrete and reinforcement. In any event, the important feature is that a continuous strip is formed for the rigid track, continuing uninterrupted past the joint 12.<br>
Stoppers 24 are provided to ensure that the position of the rigid track 1 remains constant in relation to the transverse direction of the bridge girders 2. The stoppers 24 are fastened to the bridge girder 2, and hold the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 in a fixed position in the transverse direction. The location where the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 make contact is loose, so that stresses<br><br><br>
resulting from expansion are avoided. It can therefore be favourable to provide a sliding layer here again between the stopper 24 and the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7. Because of the rigid joint between the rigid track 1 and the profiled concrete layer 7 it may be adequate merely to position the stopper 24 with respect to the profiled concrete layer 7, and to hold it laterally in position.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-section through the construction according to the invention. The left-hand side illustrates a section through the bridge girder 2 and the rigid track 1 in the region of a joint 12 between two bridge girders 2. The layer of high-resistance foam 20 and the bolster plate 21 under the profiled concrete layer 7 can therefore be seen. The profiled concrete layer 7 is wedge-shaped, as a result of which the rigid track 1 is raised. This is, in particular, necessary in track sections where the rigid track 1 is curved. As can be seen from the illustration, standard components can again be used for the rigid track 1 in this region. The lifting is created with the aid of the profiled concrete layer 7, which is concreted as required. Stoppers 24 are positioned at the side to maintain the lateral position of the rigid track 1 and of the profiled concrete layer 7. The stoppers 24 are, on the one hand, rigidly bonded to the bridge girder 12, and, on the other hand, can slide with respect to the profiled concrete layer 7 and the rigid track 1.<br>
The right-hand half of the illustration in Figure 3 shows a cross section in the region of a normal section of track, away from the joint 12. The sliding layer 10 is located between the bridge girder 2 and the profiled concrete layer 7, permitting the profiled concrete layer 7 to slide across the bridge girder 2. In other respects it is this illustration corresponds to the illustration on the left-hand side of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 4 shows a detail of the sliding connection between the profiled concrete layer 7 and the bridge girder 2. In order to permit the relatively rough surfaces of the<br><br><br>
bridge girder 2 and the profiled concrete layer 7 to slide past one another without giving rise to high friction, this embodiment incorporates a geotextile 26 on the upper side of the bridge girder 2 and on the lower side of the profiled concrete layer 7. There are two membranes 27 between the geotextiles 26. The geotextiles 26 smooth out unevenness in the surfaces of the bridge girder 2 and the profiled concrete layer 7. During concreting they are partially impregnated by the concrete being used if they are applied before the concrete sets. Usually the geotextile 26 on the bridge girder 2, however, is only applied after the concrete has set. In this case the geotextile 26 does not become impregnated. On the other hand, the profiled concrete layer 7 is usually poured onto the geotextile 26, penetrates the geotextile 26 during concreting, thus creating a firm bond. The two membranes 27 allow the profiled concrete layer 7 to slide on the bridge girder 2, resulting in very low friction. The two membranes 27 slide against one another without much resistance. In a simpler embodiment of the invention it is also adequate if only one membrane 27 and, possibly, also only one geotextile 26 are used to compensate for unevenness in the bridge girder 2 and the profiled concrete layer 7 and to permit sliding with sufficient ease.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated. Modifications in the design of the profiled concrete layer 7, the bridge girder 2 and the sliding layer 10 are possible at any time within the framework of the patent claims.<br><br><br>
