				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to composition.<br>
The present invention relates to coloured, weathering-stabilized compositions based on impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends and moulding compositions, semi-finished products and mouldings produced therefrom, whichrare employed, for example, for motor vehicle exterior uses in non-lacquered form or in a form coated only with a transparent clear lacquer.<br>
Impact-modified moulding compositions which comprise partly crystalline polyesters, amorphous polycarbonates and graft copolymers are known. Such moulding compositions are employed, for example, in the automobile sector for mouldings such as bumpers, mud guards, radiator grills, headlamp screens, tailgate screens, sills, spoilers, door handles, tank caps, linings, horizontal structural components, such as engine bonnets or roof elements, door modules or the like. Prerequisites for use in motor vehicle applications are a high heat distortion point, high flowability in the melt, good lacquer adhesion, high resistance to chemicals, high rigidity, high dimensional stability and high toughness at low temperatures.<br>
Mouldings of impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends can be coloured by two different methods. Traditionally, the mouldings are lacquered with a colouring lacquer, the so-called base lacquer. The mouldings can optionally moreover have been coated with primer and/or filler before the base lacquer. A transparent clear lacquer can furthermore optionally be applied to the base lacquer. These systems are called top-lacquered systems in the following. In top-lacquered systems the intrinsic colour of the moulding compositions is substantially irrelevant, since colouring is done by the base lacquer.<br>
As an alternative to the top-lacquered systems, there are systems which are called moulded-in colour systems in the following. In moulded-in colour systems the colour of the moulding in use is determined by the intrinsic colour of the moulding <br>
composition, that is to say moulded-in colour systems are not lacquered with a primer, filler or colouring base lacquer. However, the moulded-in colour systems can optionally be coated with transparent clear lacquer. The advantage of moulded-in colour systems lies in the saving in costs, since the working steps of priming with primer and/or fillers and of lacquering with colouring base lacquers and the associated drying operations are omitted.<br>
The use of mouldings of impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends in the motor vehicle exterior sector involves high requirements in respect of the weathering resistance of the material of the mouldings. In this context, the resistance to photooxidation by UV irradiation (called UV stability in the following) and the resistance of the materials to hydrolysing environmental influences (called stability to hydrolysis in the following) are of central importance.<br>
hi top-lacquered systems the harmful UV rays are largely kept back by the base lacquer. On the other hand, in moulded-in colour systems there is no UV-blocking function of a covering base lacquer. At best a UV-absorbing clear lacquer can hold off the majority of the harmful UV radiation in moulded-in colour systems. Nevertheless, moulding compositions which are based on moulded-in colour systems must have a high UV stability, and for this reason impact modifiers based on rubbers with conjugated dienes, such as, for example, butadiene in ABS or MBS rubbers, cannot be employed alone.<br>
Weathering-stable PC/polyester blends therefore employ, for example, acrylate rubbers, as has been described in DE-A 33 02 124.<br>
EP-B 0 787 769 describes the use of PC/polyester blends with a combination of AES and acrylate rubbers to obtain moulding compositions of improved stability to weathering and good toughness.<br><br>
The stability to hydrolysis of impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends is required in particular if the mouldings of these materials are employed under conditions with a high outside temperature and high atmospheric humidity during the life of the motor vehicle.<br>
US-A 5 354 791 describes the use of epoxide-substituted polyalkylene terephthalate moulding compositions in combination with metal-containing phosphorus compounds in impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends to improve the stability to hydrolysis. The improvement in the stability to hydrolysis is described here by the small change in the melt viscosity after storage of the material at 110 Â°C in water in an autoclave. The UV resistance and the nature of the surface are not the content of US-A 5 354 791.<br>
In moulded-in colour systems, however, in addition to the stability to weathering the ability to be coloured homogeneously is also of very great importance. Precisely in the case of impact-modified PC/polyester blends with weathering-resistant acrylate impact modifiers, in the case of injection mouldings undesirable colour inhomogeneities occur, in which periodically recurring regions coloured less, which have an optically brighter effect, with more deeply coloured regions, which have an optically darker or more colour-intensive effect, are formed perpendicular to the direction of flow during the injection moulding operation, these also being called tiger stripes. For mouldings which are perceived visually by the user in the end use, such as, for example, the motor vehicle exterior skin - such as e.g. mud guards, bumpers, tailgates, headlamp screens, spoilers, air intake grills, engine bonnets, car roofs - motor vehicle interiors, electrical housings or electronics housings, these tiger stripe effects are unacceptable.<br>
The object was to develop homogeneously coloured impact-modified polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate moulding compositions of improved weathering resistance for uses in so-called moulded-in colour systems. Increased requirements in respect of homogeneous colouring of the moulding compositions or mouldings<br><br>
are imposed on moulded-in colour systems, since the colouring of the moulding composition is responsible at the same time for the colour appearance of the finished moulding in use.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that moulding compositions based on polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate achieve the object described if at least two different systems based on graft copolymer compositions based on acrylates on the one hand and based on butadiene on the other hand are employed as the impact modifier in combination with stabilizers for increasing the UV resistance and for improving the resistance to hydrolysis. The mouldings from the compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a homogeneous appearance and homogeneous colour impression of the surface and excellent stability to weathering. The moulding compositions according to the invention are moreover distinguished by a high heat distortion point, good flowability in the melt, good lacquer adhesion, high resistance to chemicals, high rigidity, high dimensional stability and high toughness at low temperatures.<br>

According to the invention, the compositions comprise as component A one or a mixture of two or more different polyalkylene terephthalates. Polyalkylene terephthalates in the context of the invention are polyalkylene terephthalates which are derived from terephthalic acid (or its reactive derivatives) and alkanediols, for example based on ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or butanediol.

Examples of preferred branching agents are trimesic acid, trimellitic acid, trimethylolethane and -propane and pentaerythritol.<br>
It is advisable to use not more than 1 mol% of the branching agent, based on the acid component.<br>

Derivatives of the bisphenols mentioned which are accessible, for example, by alkylation or halogenation on the aromatic rings of the bisphenols mentioned are also examples of bisphenols according to the general formula (I).<br>
Examples of bisphenols according to the general formula (I) are, in particular, the<br>
following compounds: hydroquinone, resorcinol, 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl, bis-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl) sulfide, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone, bis-(3,5-dimethyl-4-<br>

The bisphenols mentioned and processes for their preparation belong to the prior art., thus also l,l-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane and the indanebisphenols. Indanebisphenols can be prepared, for example, from isopropenylphenol or derivatives thereof, or from dimers of isopropenylphenol or derivatives thereof in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst in organic solvents.<br>
Polycarbonates can be prepared by known processes. Suitable processes for the preparation of polycarbonates are, for example, preparation from bisphenols with phosgene by the phase boundary process or from bisphenols with phosgene by the process in a homogeneous phase, the so-called pyridine process, or from bisphenols with carbonic acid esters by the melt transesterification process. These preparation processes are described e.g. in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, volume 9, p. 31-76, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964.<br>
The melt transesterification process is described, in particular, in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, volume 9, p. 44 to 51, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964.<br>
Raw materials and auxiliary substances with a low degree of impurities are preferably employed in the preparation of polycarbonate. In the preparation by the melt transesterification process in particular, the bisphenols employed and the carbonic acid derivatives employed should be as free as possible from alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions. Raw materials of such purity are obtainable, for example, by recrystallizing, washing or distilling the carbonic acid derivatives, for example carbonic acid esters, and the bisphenols.The polycarbonates to be employed according to the invention preferably have a weight-average molecular weight (Mw), which can be determined e.g. by ultracentrifugation or scattered light measurement, of 10,000 to 200,000 g/mol. They particularly preferably have a weight-average molecular weight of 12,000 to 80,000 g/mol, especially preferably 20,000 to 35,000 g/mol.<br>
The average molecular weight of the polycarbonates to be employed according to the invention can be established, for example, in a known manner by an appropriate amount of chain terminators. The chain terminators can be employed individually or as a mixture of various chain terminators.<br>
Suitable chain terminators are both monophenols and monocarboxylic acids. Suitable monophenols are e.g. phenol, p-chlorophenol, p-tert-butylphenol, cumylphenol or 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and long-chain alkylphenols, such as e.g. 4-(l,l,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol, or monoalkylphenols or dialkylphenols having a total of 8 to 20 C atoms in the alkyl substituents, such as e.g. 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol, p-tert-octylphenol, p-dodecylphenol, 2-(3,5-dimethyl-heptyl)-phenol or 4-(3,5-dimethyl-heptyl)-phenol. Suitable monocarboxylic acids are benzoic acid, alkylbenzoic acids and halogenobenzoic acids.<br>
Preferred chain terminators are phenol, p-tert-butylphenol, 4-(l,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol and cumylphenol.<br>
The amount of chain terminators to be employed is preferably between 0.25 and 10 mol%, based on the total of the particular bisphenols employed.<br>
The polycarbonates to be employed according to the invention can be branched in a known manner, and in particular preferably by incorporation of branching agents which are trifunctional or more than trifunctional. Suitable branching agents are e.g. those having three or more than three phenolic groups or those having three or more than three carboxylic acid groups.<br>
Branching agents which are suitable according to the invention are, for example,<br>
phloroglucinol, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-hept-2-ene, 4,6-dimethyl-<br>
2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-heptane, 1,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-benzene, 1,1,1-<br>
tris-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane, tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenyl-methane, 2,2-bis-[4,4-<br>
bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl]-propane, 2,4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl-isopropyl)-<br>
phenol,	2,6-bis-(2-hydroxy-5'-methyl-benzyl)-4-methylphenol,	2-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane, hexa-(4-(4-hydroxyphenyl-<br>
isopropyl)-phenyl) terephthalate, tetra-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane, tetra-(4-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl-isopropyl)-phenoxy)-methane	and	l,4-bis-(4',4"-<br>
dihydroxytriphenyl)-methylbenzene and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride, 3,3-bis-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole, trimesic acid trichloride and o,a',Q!"-tris-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-l,3,5-triisopropylbenzene.Branching agents which are preferably to be employed are l,l,l-tris-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane and 3,3-bis-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole.<br>
The amount of the branching agents optionally to be employed is preferably 0.05 mol% to 2 mol%, based on the moles of bisphenols employed.<br>
In the case of preparation of the polycarbonate by the phase boundary process, for example, the branching agents can be initially introduced into the aqueous alkaline phase with the bisphenols and the chain terminators, or they can be added as a solution in an organic solvent, together with the carbonic acid derivatives. In the case of the transesterification process, the branching agents are preferably metered in together with the dihydroxyaromatics or bisphenols.<br>

Mixing in of individual components, in particular stabilizers, additives and colouring agents, can furthermore already be carried out during synthesis of the polymers employed according to the invention. Mixing of components A to D and further constituents is preferably effected at temperatures of 220 to 330 Â°C by joint kneading, extrusion or milling of the components.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be processed to all types of semifinished products or moulding by conventional processes. Examples of processing processes which may be mentioned are extrusion processes and injection moulding processes. Examples of semi-finished products which may be mentioned are films and sheets.<br>
Because of the high colour homogeneity, the mouldings are particularly suitable for uses which are visually and optically important. According to the invention, the mouldings can be employed in a non-lacquered form or in a form coated with a transparent clear lacquer system. However, the mouldings can of course also be lacquered with a colouring base lacquer. The mouldings can be small or large components and can be employed for exterior or interior uses. Preferably, large-component mouldings are produced for vehicle construction, in particular the automobile sector. In particular, vehicle body exterior components, such as e.g. mud guards, tail gates, engine bonnets, bumpers, loading areas, covers for loading areas, car roofs, air intake grills, spoilers or other vehicle body components, can be produced from the moulding compositions according to the invention.<br>
Mouldings or semi-finished products from the moulding compositions/compositions according to the invention can also be in a composite with further materials, such as e.g. metal or plastic. The moulding compositions according to the invention or themouldings/semi-finished products from the moulding compositions according to the invention can be employed in a composite with other materials or with themselves for the production of finished components, such as e.g. vehicle body exterior components, by conventional techniques of bonding and joining of several components or parts, such as e.g. coextrusion, injection moulding under films, injection moulding around embedded components, gluing, welding, screwing or clamping.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can also be used for numerous further uses. Examples which may be mentioned are the use in electrical and electronics engineering and in the construction sector. Mouldings from the moulding compositions according to the invention can be used in the fields of use mentioned, for example, as lamp covers, as safety panes, as housing material for electronic apparatuses, as housing material for domestic appliances and as sheets for the production of covers.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a very good colour homogeneity and by a very good stability to weathering. They moreover fulfil high requirements with regard to processing stability, flowability of the melt, toughness, toughness at low temperatures, rigidity, heat distortion point, thermal expansion, surface quality, lacquerability, resistance to chemicals and resistance to fuels.<br>

In addition, commercially available processing auxiliaries are employed as additives.<br>
Compounding operations were carried out on a twin-screw extruder of the type ZSK32 (Werner und Pfleiderer) at melt temperatures of 250 to 290 Â°C.<br>
The test specimens were injection moulded on an injection moulding machine of the type Arburg 320-210-500 at melt temperatures of 260 to 280 Â°C and mould temperatures of 70 to 90 Â°C.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention were tested by the following methods:<br>
Vicat B: Heat distortion stability or heat distortion point in accordance with DIN ISO 306/B 120 in silicone oil.<br>
Izod impact strength: Toughness in accordance with ISO 180 method 1 U at -30 Â°C.<br>
Izod notched impact strength: Toughness in accordance with ISO 180 method 1 A at 23 Â°C.<br>
Tensile E modulus and tensile strength in accordance with DIN / EN / ISO 527-2/1 A.<br>
MVR: Flowability in accordance with DIN/ISO 1133 at 260 Â°C and 5 kg.<br>
Colour homogeneity: Determination of the colour homogeneity of the surface by visual assessment.<br>
"+" means a homogeneous coloration without the formation of stripes of lower colour intensity perpendicular to the direction of flow (tiger stripes)"0" means a largely homogenous coloration with slight formation of stripes of lower colour intensity perpendicular to the direction of flow<br>
"-" means an inhomogeneous coloration with severe formation of stripes perpendicular to the direction of flow.<br>
The evaluation of the colour homogeneity was carried out on sheets of 150 x 105 x 1.6 mm, which were produced with a melt temperature of 270 Â°C, a mould temperature of 80 Â°C and a filling rate of 50 mm/s via a film gate on a 105 mm side.<br>
As can be seen from table 1, the moulding compositions according to the invention have the required combination of very good colour homogeneity and good stability to hydrolysis (&gt;60% of the initial tensile strength after hydrolysis) with simultaneously good mechanical properties. Compared with comparison examples 2 and 3, the moulding compositions according to the invention moreover are significantly more stable to UV, because the content of UV-sensitive components C is significantly lower.<br>
The composition and properties of the thermoplastic moulding compositions according to the invention can be seen from table 1.<br>
