COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition. In particular, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a pigment and a compound which acts as a dispersant, and methods for making and using the composition.<br>
Liquid compositions containing a pigment typically require a dispersant to maintain the stability of the dispersant in the liquid carrier. Dispersants of the prior art have included adipates such as such as dioctyl adipate (DOA) and phthalate plasticisers such as dioctyl phthalate (OOP). The safety of these plasticisers has been called into question, particularly in certain applications and there is a desire to avoid their use.<br>
Particular areas in which pigment dispersants have been used is in the provision of colourants for plastics, printing inks, and paints and lacquers.<br>
As discussed in US 5308395, traditionally, plastics have been coloured by tumble blending the plastic with a solid colourant or additive concentrate such as a colouring powder. The blended material is then fed into an extruder or moulding machine where the resin and the colourant are plasticised and the colourant is incorporated into the molten plastic. However, this method has a number of drawbacks. In many cases, a solid colourant or additive concentrate does not uniformly mix with plastic, or it does not disperse uniformly during moulding. Further, solid colourants often segregate from the plastic during pre-moulding handling because of particle size or specific gravity differences.<br>
In recent years, liquid colour compositions have been developed in an effort to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional solid colourants. Being liquids, these colourant concentrates may be accurately metered directly into moulding machines or extruders by in-line metering systems, which help overcome many of the disadvantages of solid colourants.<br>
As discussed in US 5531819 printing inks are commonly used in ink jet printing systems. There have been proposed various kinds of ink jet recording systems, for example, a so-called electric field control system of jetting out ink by utilising an electrostatic attraction force; a so-called drop-on-demand system of jetting out ink by<br><br>
jtilising a vibrational pressure of a piezo element (pressure pulse system); and a so-called thermal ink jet system of jetting out ink by utilising a pressure resulting from forming and growing bubbles by heating at high temperatures, and they can provide images of extremely high resolution.<br>
For many ink jet systems, an aqueous ink using water as a main solvent and an oil ink jsing an organic solvent as a main solvent have generally been used. Printed images obtained by using the aqueous ink are generally poor in water proofing, whereas the oil ink can provide printed images of excellent waterproofing. US 5531819 proposes plasticisers which may be used in oil inks.<br>
As discussed in US 4230609 pigments may also be delivered in the form of water reducible coatings. A water reducible coating is defined to be a colloidal dispersion in an organic solvent and water whose resin concentration can be reduced with water or solvent, which when reduced with a coalescing solvent forms a durable coating when applied to a substrate surface. Other names applied to water reducible coatings are water-borne, water solubilised, and water dilutable.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides a composition comprising i) a pigment ii) a compound having the formula <br>
wherein R1, R2  and R3 are independently selected from an acyl group or a hydrogen atom, wherein at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is an acyl group (a short acyl group) having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, wherein at least one of Ri. R2 and R3 is a branched chain acyl group (a long acyl group) consisting of a chain having 10 to 20 carbon atoms and a hydrophilic branch group.<br>
The dispersant of the present invention is (i) cost effective as it may synthesised from readily available products, for example castor oil, (ii) produces a stable dispersion with a wide variety of organic and inorganic pigments and dyes, (iii) allows for high pigment loads, and/or (iv) possess good shelf stability and uniformity<br><br>
In one aspect the composition of the invention is a pigment composition for colouring a polymer. In this aspect further advantages are observed.<br>
The dispersant is compatible with a wide variety of commercial thermoplastic resins, is suitable for use in conventional in-line metering and blending equipment, produces uniform colour finished products without visible streaks or specks, eliminates screw slippage and/or is stable at the temperatures normally encountered in plastics moulding and extrusion equipment.<br>
In one aspect the composition of the invention is a pigment composition for an ink. In this aspect further advantages are observed. The composition of the invention allows the provision of a hot melt ink, which is optimum as an ink for hot melt type ink jet recording, capable of reducing the heat of fusion without increasing the viscosity of the ink   as   a   whole,   improving   transparency,   providing   plasticity,   reducing   haze<br>
Â«<br>
(representing the extent of cloud, also referred as cloudiness), providing luster and/or easily dissolving a dye as a colorant and capable of providing a sufficient solubility, particularly to a black or cyanine dye.<br>
In one aspect the composition of the invention is, or is usable in, a water reducible coating. In this aspect further advantages are observed. The composition of the invention may (i) provide for lower solvent cost; (ii) lower the amount of organic solvent used to decrease atmospheric pollution; (iii) lower phase inversion viscosity - the point at which the organic solvent (to which mixture water is being added) changes from a water-in-oil dispersion to an oil-in-water dispersion. This would make mixing easier and would require less energy to make up the composition; (iv) increase the solids content of the composition, to give coatings offering improved protection to substrate surfaces, without at the same time thickening the material and making it difficult to apply; (v) act as a plasticiser and therefore allow for a decrease in the addition of further plasticiser which in some applications may be detrimental to the coating, being extractable from the coatings by solvents; (vi) decrease carboxyl group content of the resin to decrease further the water sensitivity of the final coating.<br>

Dispersant compositions containing approximately 90 wt% of the above compounds were prepared from castor oil and hardened castor oil in accordance with the teaching of WO 01/14466. The respective dispersant compositions are denoted using the notation of the respective dispersant compound.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-5 - Polymer Systems<br>
In Examples 1-5, white and black colour concentrates are formulated in the indicated proportions by dissolving the low molecular addition polymer and Emersoi 213 oleic acid in the solvent, then adding the pigment under agitation, and dispersing the pigment at high speed until a uniform, stable dispersion is achieved, usually in about 30 minutes. The white pigment is DuPont R-900 titanium dioxide. The black pigment is Columbian Carbon Raven 1255.<br>
Nine parts of the white colour concentrate and 1 part of the black colour concentrate are then mixed to form a mixed colour concentrate. One part of the mixed concentrate is tumble blended with 99 parts of Shell polypropylene resin 5824S, and moulded into 3mm thick panels in a conventional laboratory scale injection moulding machine. No screw slippage is observed in any of these examples, and all of the moulded panels have a uniform colour with no visible specks or streaks.<br>

EXAMPLES 6 &amp; 7 - Ink Systems<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The ink composition is as shown below.<br>
Paraffin wax standard product 155 (paraffin wax)	83 wt %<br>
EVAFLEX 210 (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer)	10 wt %<br>
Composition A	5 wt %<br>
Oil Black HBB (C.i. SOLVENT BLACK 3)	2 wt %<br>
The normal room temperature solid wax of the vehicle is paraffin wax (paraffin wax standard product 155. manufactured by NIPPON SEIRO CO.. LTD.) having a melting point of about 69Â°C. The resin of the vehicle is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAFLEX 210. manufactured by MITSUI POLYCHEMICALS CO.. LTD.). The oil-soluble dye as the colorant is colour index (C.I.) SOLVENT BLACK 3 (Oil Black HBB. manufactured by Orient Chemical Co., Ltd.).<br>
Paraffin wax, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and Composition A are melted by heating at a temperature of about 70Â°C to 250Â°C to which C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 3 is mixed. Then, they are mixed under stirring at 200 to 10.000 rpm. preferably. 500 to 5.000 rpm by a dissolver. The composition mixed under stirring is filtered by using a 2-|im mesh filter by a hot-filtering device manufactured by ADVANTEC TOYO CO., LTD. to obtain a final hot melt ink.<br>
2 to 3 droplets of the prepared hot melt ink is placed and melted on a slide glass heated to 120Â°C. on which a cover glass is placed and pressed slightly. Then, as a result of observation under transmission light by a microscope "XF-UNR" manufactured by NIKON CORPORATION, particles are scarcely observed. Accordingly, it is confirmed that most of C.I. SOLVENT BLACK 3 as the dye is dissolved substantially completely in the ink composifion.<br>
The hot melt ink obtained as described above can be used suitably as ink for a hot melt ype ink jet printer.<br><br>
When the ink is loaded to an ink jet printer and heated to an ink jetting temperature (100 to 150Â°C, preferably. 125 to 135Â°C). the ink is melted rapidly. Then, as a result of ink jetting, satisfactory fixing performance on recording paper is shown. Further, when the ink is printed also on an OHP (Over Head Projector) film, it shows excellent transparency, and it is confirmed that the ink does not peel but is fixed firmly even when the film is flexed.<br>
Example 7<br>
The ink composition is as shown below.<br>
Hi-Mic 2065 (microcrystalline wax)	35 wt %<br>
Arkon P-90 (hydrogenated petroleum resin)	53 wt %<br>
, Composition B	10 wt %<br>
NEOPEN BLUE 808 (C.I. SOLVENT BLUE 70)	2 wt %<br>
The microcrystalline wax (Hi-Mic 2065, manufactured by NIPPON SEIRO CO.. LTD.) has a melting point of about 75Â°C. The resin of the vehicle is hydrogenated petroleum resin (Arkon P-90, manufactured by ARAKAWA CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LIMITED).The oil-soluble dye as the colorant is color index (C.I.) SOLVENT BLUE 70 (NEOPEN BLUE 808. manufactured by BASF Co.).<br>
The hot melt ink can be produced by the same procedures as those in Example 6.<br>
2 to 3 droplets of the thus prepared hot melt ink is placed and melted on a slide glass heated to 120Â°C on which a cover glass is placed and pressed slightly. Then, as a result of observation under transmission light by a microscope "XF-UNR" manufactured by NIKON CORPORATION, particles are scarcely observed. Accordingly, it is confirmed that most of C.I. SOLVENT BLUE 70 as the dye was dissolved substantially completely in the ink composition.<br>
The hot melt ink can be used suitably as ink for a hot melt type ink jet printer.<br>
When the ink is loaded to an ink jet printer and heated to an ink jetting temperature (100 to 150Â°C, preferably, 125 to 135Â°C). the ink is melted rapidly. Then, as a result of<br><br>
ink jetting, satisfactory fixing performance on recording paper is shown. Further, when the ink is printed also on an OHP (Over Head Projector) film, it shows excellent transparency, and it is confirmed that the ink does not peel but is fixed firmly even when the film is flexed.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 â  Paint System<br>
Polymerisations are carried out in a closed laboratory reactor with agitation. For each batch, the reactor is evacuated, and the ingredients are transferred to the reactor by vacuum. After the charge, the reactor is again evacuated five minutes and then pressurised to 10 psi (68.9 kPa) with nitrogen. Initial polymerisation temperature is about 52Â°C. and is allowed to rise to about 57Â°C. at 30-32 percent solids. Percent solids is checked at two-hour intervals. Reaction ingredients, conditions, and final product characteristics for a set of typical reactions are given in Table 1, and final product characteristics are given in Table 1.<br><br>
