Resolution of a Narwedine Amide Derivative<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides for an efficient method of effecting the resolution of a narwedine amide, and the synthesis of galantamine.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Narwedine derivatives have been utilized for the synthesis of (-) galantamine, a natural product derived from Amaryllidaceae species, which has recently been approved as an Alzheimer's drug. Initially this substance was obtained in pure form by extraction from bulbs of Causasian snowdrops but recently (-) galantamine has been shown to be obtained more efficiently by total synthesis. The synthesis of galantamine in either chiral form or achiral form has been the topic of a number of patents and papers.<br>
Galantamine was originally synthesized in optically active form by Barton and Kirby (J. Chem. Soc, 1962(806)) where they demonstrated a resolution by seeding with (+)-galantamine to produce crystals of (-) narwedine which is the precursor to the<br><br>
desired (-)-galantamine by subsequent reduction of the ketone.<br>
It was shown that a number of other galantamine derivatives<br>
could be used to produce the desired crystallization.  In their<br>
procedure  they  employed  large  amounts  of  seed  crystals.<br>
Likewise,  US  Patent  No.  5,428,159  demonstrates  a  similar<br>
resolution with the use of (-) narwedine as a seed and the use<br>
of only 1-2.5% seed equivalence.  In either case, an amide had<br>
been prepared during the synthesis of the {-+) narwedine and<br>
this  amide  was  reduced  to  the  free  amine  prior  to  the<br>
resolution.   Therefore,  it would be advantageous if an amide<br>
precursor could be resolved and the reduction accomplished later<br>
in the synthesis.<br>
The  synthesis  of  (-+)-galantamine  has  been  previously<br>
reported to proceed through the synthesis of bromoamide (I) by<br>
the  oxidative  cyclization  of  the  diphenol  (II)  (Kametani,<br>
et.al., J. Chem. Soc.  (C) , 2602(1969)}. The resolution of this<br>
amide has not been reported. One of the apparent difficulties is<br>
to obtain a source of seed crystals which contain a similar<br>
structure in that this compound is not a natural product.<br>
Likewise the change from an amine to an amide would create a<br>
different geometry in the molecule and eliminate a source of<br><br>
basic amine useful in the resolution and also create greatly<br>
different solubility.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This  invention  demonstrates  an  efficient  method  of effecting resolution of the narwedine amide derivative (I).<br><br>
The preparation of the narwedine bromoamide (I) could be accomplished in acceptable yield from the diphenol by oxidation in toluene-water with potassium ferricyanide. It was discovered that this amide derivative is much less soluble in a variety of organic solvents than narwedine itself. However we have found that it can be crystallized with good to excellent optical resolution from a variety of polar solvents. Likewise, we have formed diastereomeric esters of the reduced alcohol form of (I) and we have separated these, esters by chromatography.   The<br><br>
subsequent hydrolysis of these esters produced the pure chiral alcohols which could be used as seed crystals for the initial studies. Thus, if the racemic bromoamide (I) is dissolved in an organic solvent and an amine base and 0.5 - 5% of the ( + ) form of the alcohol III prepared from I is added and the mixture cooled to the point where crystallization occurs, the crystals collected will exhibit significant chiral induction in the form of the (-) enantiomer of (I). In fact, greater than 50% recovery is obtained during this dynamic resolution.<br>
The preferred solvents are alcohols, acetonitrile, ketones and THF, however any solvent that the compound (I) can be crystallized from is viable in this process. The seed crystal can be (-) -galantamine, (-) -bromoamide (I) or the ( + ) -bromoamide alcohol III. A soluble amine base is employed as a catalyst in order to racemize continually the (+)-bromoamide (I) which remains in solution during the crystallization of the (-)-bromoamide (I) . Likewise, a chiral amine base can be employed in place of or in addition to the use of a seed crystal with the desirable effect of increasing the crystallization efficiency.<br>
The  chiral  amine  may  be  preferably  Î±-phenyl  ethylamine, cinchonine,  cinchonidine,  ephredrinef  N-methylglucamine.  Thus<br><br>
compound (I) together with the amine base is heated in an organic solvent to effect dissolution- The solution is cooled and then maintained at the desired temperature for a period of time to allow slow crystallization. The crystallized solid is then filtered off, washed and dried to produce (-)-bromoamide (I) substantially enhanced in optical purity. The remaining (+-)-bromoamide (I) can be recycled into another optical resolution without loss of material. This provides for a very economical process.<br>
In addition, the present invention further provides for a compound of formula:<br><br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aryl and arylalkyl; Al, A2, are, together, 0; Bl and B2 are H; Y is H or Me; and Z is a blocking group.  This compound can be<br><br>
resolved by use of a seed crystal or a chiral amine base as discussed above for the resolution of bromoamide (I),<br>
The resolved (-)-bromoamide I can be converted in high yield to (-) galantamine by subsequent reduction of the ketone group to the alcohol (III) of required stereochemistry and finally reduction of the amide and the bromide with lithium aluminum hydride to produce (-)-galantamine. Thus this invention demonstrates an efficient method to produce (-) galantamine by the efficient resolution of the readily available compound I.<br>
The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of the disclosure- For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, and specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to the drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>

cooled to 50Â° C and held at this temperature with stirring for 18 hours. The precipitated solid was filtered off at room temperature and washed with 4 ml of THF. The product was dried to produce 245 mg (61% yield) of (-)-bromoamide (I) which exhibited an isomer ratio of 92:8 (84% ee) by HPLC analysis.<br><br>
Racemic bromoamide (I) (400 mg) and 4 mg of ( + ) -bromoamide alcohol (III) was dissolved in 10.5 ml of acetone and triethyl amine (9:1) at reflux to form a clear solution.  The solution<br>
was cooled to 40Â° C over 3 hours and held at this temperature for 16 hours to form a suspension of white solid. The mixture was cooled to 25Â° C and filtered. The cake was washed with 4 ml of cold isopropyl alcohol and dried to yield 161 mg of (-) -bromoamide (I) with an isomer ratio of 98:2 (96% ee).<br>
