TITLE<br>
"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR<br>
THE REMOVAL OF MOLTEN GLASS FROM FLOW CHANNELS"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The invention relates to a method for removing molten glass from flow channels<br>
for the transport of production glass, these channels being installed between a melting<br>
furnace and an extraction point for the production glass, whereby the flow channel has<br>
a glass-resistant inner lining, the exterior of which is surrounded by mineral thermal<br>
insulation material and whereby a drainage appliance for bottom glass is installed<br>
upstream of the extraction point for the production glass.<br>
[002] In order to be able to evaluate the state-of-the-art and the invention it is<br>
advisable to consider, on the one hand, details of the constructional elements of heated<br>
flow channels that are also referred to as feeders or forehearths and, on the other hand,<br>
the elements of the electrical current paths and the heat thereby produced in such flow<br>
channels.<br>
[003] Both the mineral internal surfaces of the flow channels and the metal external<br>
surfaces of electrodes are susceptible in varying degrees to attack by normal glass<br>
melts, whereby the reaction products are heavier than the molten glass and collect on<br>
the bottom of the flow channel in the form of contaminated bottom glass. The reaction<br>
products of the glass with metal electrodes that are immersed directly in the molten<br>
glass are particularly damaging. Other contaminants such as stones and knots are also<br>
deposited in the bottom glass.<br>
[004] The molten glass above the bottom glass is intended for the manufacture of<br>
products and therefore termed production glass. This production glass is removed at an<br>
extraction point, either continuously, e.g., for the production of flat glass, or in portions,<br>
e.g., as gobs for the manufacture of bottles and drinking vessels.<br><br>
[005] If the bottom glass that is separated from the production glass by a phase<br>
boundary is not removed, either continuously or intermittently, through a drainage<br>
opening upstream of the extraction point for the production glass, then the production<br>
glass becomes contaminated by the bottom glass and cannot be used. Among other<br>
things, this leads to impairment of the transparency, for example as a result of<br>
discolouration and/or the formation of cords, known in the industry as "cat scratches".<br>
[006] Another problem area lies in the type and shape of the mineral materials used<br>
for the flow channel and their geometric location relative to the electrodes. If, as is<br>
known, the inner lining of the flow channel consists of a fusion cast material from the<br>
group of AZS or ZAC materials, such as an Al2O3-ZrO2-SiO2, also known as ternary<br>
systems, then the electrical conductivity is approximately 20 times higher than that of<br>
normal mineral materials, such as those used for the thermal insulation of the flow<br>
channels. As a result, the electrical current paths tend to run through such materials,<br>
whereby the shape of the materials and the spatial coordinates of these current paths<br>
within these materials and the passage and course of the current paths from the<br>
individual electrodes, to and in the glass melt, must also be determined. However, there<br>
is also interaction between these current paths and the spatial coordinates of the<br>
temperatures to consider.<br>
[007] This results in certain relationships between the relative values of the currents<br>
that flow through the mineral materials and the molten glass, and the resulting localised<br>
heating effect. The electrical conductivity, or the specific electrical resistance, for both<br>
the glass and the mineral materials are extremely temperature dependent over several<br>
orders of magnitude within a temperature range between 700 and 1700 Â°C. The results<br>
are therefore based on numerous, intensive and expensive tests, undertaken until the<br>
best possible solution is found. The rate of temperature change in the area around the<br>
drain opening also plays a role in this respect.<br>
State-of-the-art:<br>
[008] From the HVG-Mitteilung (= HVG-Newsletter) No. 1617 and a paper given on<br>
20th April 1988 and the German patent DE 40 06 229 C2 it is known that to prevent the<br>
formation of cords, so-called "cat scratches", in the end production, a so-called<br>
drainage opening (a second bottom outlet) can be installed in a feeder of a glass melting<br>
installation upstream of the bottom outlet for molten production glass and its end<br><br>
products. It is also possible to provide a bottom barrier after the bottom outlet to<br>
prevent the heavier bottom glass from progressing to the production outlet. However,<br>
no mention is made of directly associated heating systems, their control systems or<br>
spatial temperature coordinates.<br>
[009] From European patent EP 0 329 930 B1 from 1989 and the article by Herbert<br>
Lutz entitled "CONTI-DRAIN , a SorgÂ® solution for zircon cords in production",<br>
published in Glas-Ingenieur, 1-99, pages 47 to 50, it is also known that an electrode for<br>
connection to a transformer with a thyristor unit can be installed below a nozzle used to<br>
drain the bottom glass that forms zircon cords. The power is controlled by a<br>
temperature sensor installed near the bottom outlet. However, it is explicitly stated that<br>
a counter-electrode must be installed in the molten glass. However, as these counter-<br>
electrodes must be made of a metal, albeit one with a high melting point such as<br>
molybdenum, it is not possible to prevent these electrodes from slowly dissolving in the<br>
glass. This process is known and leads to contamination of the glass. It is counter<br>
productive and simply replaces one problem with another. The documents mentioned<br>
describe the possibilities for controlling the correlations as being vague and mostly<br>
unclear and imperfect.<br>
[0010] In this respect the following should be noted: direct electric heating using metal<br>
electrodes such as molybdenum, or zirconium electrodes is not without problems,<br>
especially in connection with flint glass. Complex reactions take place on the electrode<br>
surface and cause the formation of a contact layer. This layer is made of several<br>
components, however, it is comprised mainly of compounds of the metal and oxygen,<br>
or sulphur. Although it is basically a thin layer, changes in the operating conditions can<br>
cause erosion of some of the layer, and this appears as a dark mark in the production<br>
glass. Another consequence is the frequent occurrence of oxygen bubbles that appear<br>
either simultaneously or later.<br>
[0011] Although German patent DE 24 61 700 C3 published in 1974 teaches that the<br>
metal electrodes can be removed from the direct influence of the glass and that certain<br>
ceramic linings or inner coatings in the feeder, known in the trade as ZAC, can be used<br>
between the electrodes and the glass melt. The electrical resistance of such ceramic<br>
materials have a negative coefficient, i.e., their conductivity increases as the<br>
temperature rises, as is also the case with glass. When the temperature distribution is<br>
uneven as a result of changes in the thermal balance between the heating and the<br><br>
cooling, very different spatial coordinates for the individual electric current paths<br>
ensue. Some current paths between the electrodes behind and below the surface areas of<br>
the external refractory cladding are indicated, but not the current paths, or the<br>
possibilities to control them, to a circular electrode installed below the bottom outlet for<br>
the production glass. No mention is made of any heatable drainage opening installed<br>
upstream of the production outlet.<br>
[0012] Through German patent DE 2 017 096 Al it is known that it is possible to<br>
install a row of circular electrodes vertically and co-axially below a bottom outlet of a<br>
feeder in order to control glass removal. It is also possible to insert a concentric<br>
electrode lance through these circular electrodes. Molybdenum is given as the material<br>
for the electrodes. This material also comes into contact with the molten glass, albeit<br>
only after it has left the feeder. It is also given that such a system can be installed either<br>
below a feeder for draining the surface glass, i.e., the production glass, or in the tank<br>
bottom for draining the bottom glass. However, experience has shown this level of<br>
choice is not available in practice as conditions differ. In particular, despite the glass<br>
contact, such a system does not have an extensive thermal influence on the molten glass<br>
flow in the feeder or flow channel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The object of the invention is therefore to describe a method for removing the<br>
molten glass from flow channels and an apparatus to achieve this using electrodes that<br>
interact electrically and thermally with a drainage outlet that has a circular counter<br>
electrode, whereby the electrodes are protected from the direct influence of the molten<br>
glass, but the effective electrode ends still have a local and temporal influence on the<br>
temperature profile within the cross-section of the molten glass flow in the flow<br>
channel and/or above the drainage opening.<br>
[0014] The object of the invention is accomplished in accordance with the process<br>
described above in that:<br>
[0015] a) the inner lining, at least in the area of the drainage equipment, is made of<br>
a fusion cast, electrically conductive mineral material from the group of AZS and ZAC<br>
compositions, whereby a drainage opening for the bottom glass is installed in the inner<br><br>
lining, and above this drainage opening there is a drainage slit that runs across the flow<br>
direction, and that<br>
[0016] b) at least two electrodes are installed on opposite sides of the flow channel<br>
and the drain for the bottom glass. Such electrodes are rod-shaped and the front ends<br>
are inserted deeply into the inner lining towards the molten glass without contact with<br>
the molten glass, such that the majority of the electrical current flows through the<br>
molten glass to an electrode plate installed below the drainage opening, so that the<br>
bottom glass is heated more strongly than the production glass above it.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
[0017] The object of the invention is thereby completely solved. In particular, on the<br>
one hand the electrodes are protected from the direct influence of the molten glass, on<br>
the other hand the effective electrode ends still have a spatial and temporal influence on<br>
the locations of the current paths and the temperature profile within the cross-section of<br>
the molten glass in the flow channel and/or over the drainage opening.<br>
[0018] In accordance with further embodiments of the method according to the<br>
invention it is particularly advantageous if- either individually or in combination:<br>
[0019] â¢	the opposing electrodes are installed above a virtual horizontal plane in<br>
which a phase boundary between the production glass and the bottom glass exists<br>
and/or, when<br>
[0020] â¢	the opposing electrodes are installed below a virtual horizontal plane in<br>
which a phase boundary between the production glass and the bottom glass exists.<br>
Achievements by means of the inventive apparatus:<br>
[0021] The invention also relates to an apparatus for the removal of molten glass from<br>
flow channels for the transport of production glass, these channels being installed<br>
between a melting furnace and an extraction point for the production glass, whereby the<br>
flow channel has a glass-resistant inner lining, the exterior of which is surrounded by<br>
mineral thermal insulation material and whereby a drainage appliance for bottom glass<br>
is installed upstream of the extraction point for the production glass.<br>
[0022] To accomplish this object and to offer the same advantages such an apparatus<br>
according to the invention is characterized by the fact, that<br><br>
[0023] a) the inner lining, at least in the area of the drainage equipment, is made of<br>
a fusion cast, electrically conductive mineral material from the group of AZS and ZAC<br>
compositions, whereby a drainage opening for the bottom glass is installed in the inner<br>
lining, and above this drainage opening there is a drainage slit that runs across the flow<br>
channel, and that<br>
[0024] b) at least two electrodes are installed on opposite sides of the flow channel<br>
and the drain for the bottom glass. Such electrodes are rod-shaped and the front ends<br>
are inserted deeply into the inner lining towards the molten glass without contact with<br>
the molten glass, such that the majority of the electrical current flows through the<br>
molten glass to an electrode plate installed below the drainage opening.<br>
[0025] In accordance with further embodiments of the method according to the<br>
invention it is particularly advantageous if- either individually or in combination:<br>
[0026] â¢	the electrodes are installed opposite one another above an opening for<br>
the entry of the bottom glass,<br>
[0027] â¢	the electrodes are installed opposite one another below an opening for<br>
the entry of the bottom glass,<br>
[0028] â¢	there is a drainage slit in the inner lining above the drainage outlet and<br>
this slit - when viewed perpendicular to the main axis of flow of the flow channel -<br>
narrows from the inlet opening down two sloping surfaces to the drainage outlet,<br>
[0029] â¢	the sloping surfaces are aligned at an angle "a" between 15 and 45<br>
degrees to the horizontal, and/or<br>
[0030] â¢	the electrode axes are aligned with a horizontal direction component<br>
with the axis (A-A) that runs through the drainage outlet.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0038] FIG. 1 shows the end of a flow channel 1, the beginning of which, not shown<br>
here, is connected to a glass melting furnace. This determines the flow direction 2 of<br>
the molten glass 3, which has a melt surface 4. The flow channel 1 has a glass-resistant<br>
inner lining 5, 5a, whereby the inner lining 5a forms a partial area comprising a fusion<br>
cast mineral material from the group of AZS and ZAC compositions.<br>
[0039] With regard to this Dr. Illig describes in "ABC Glas", published by Deutscher<br>
Verlag for the Raw Material Industry, Leipzig, 1991, page 23: AZS refractories -<br>
alumina-zircon-silicate refractories -&gt;refractory products containing zircon. On pages<br>
235/236 under "fusion cast refractories" their particular suitability for glass melting;<br>
and on page 303, under "refractory products containing zircon" their particular<br>
suitability in the substructure of furnaces and forehearths for glass melting.<br>
[0040] In "Glass Furnaces, Design, Construction and Operation", published by<br>
Springer Verlag, 1984, on page 66 under 4.2.4 "fusion cast blocks", using the terms<br>
corundum-zircon refractories (CZ blocks), W. Trier also describes their particular<br>
suitability for electrically heated glass melting furnaces as they demonstrate relatively<br>
low electric resistance. Illustration 4.3 on page 68 shows a diagram of the temperature<br><br>
dependence of the specific electrical resistance of furnace refractories and some glasses<br>
within the temperature range 800-1500 Â°C. On page 67 table 4.4 "chemical and<br>
mineralogical composition and physical properties of fusion cast refractories" for the<br>
zircon corundum group includes under "corundum-zircon refractories" the details<br>
ER1681 and ER1711. Note: the terms ZAC 1681 and ZAC 1711 are also used in this<br>
respect.<br>
[0041] The flow channel 1 has a substructure la and a superstructure 1b, separated<br>
from one another by a joint 1c. The glass melt surface 4 is immediately below this joint<br>
1c. The superstructure lb is constructed in layers, but it is not necessary to describe this<br>
in detail here. The superstructure lb is heated by two rows of gas burners 10 installed<br>
on opposite sides. These burners are indicated here only by their outlet apertures. Along<br>
the flow direction 2 there follow a measuring opening 11, a waste gas flue 12 for the<br>
flue gases from the gas burners 10 and two measuring openings 13 and 14. The<br>
measuring openings can be used for the introduction of pyrometers or thermocouples.<br>
The space 15 is a free space for the installation of a barrier.<br>
[0042] The inner lining 5, 5a has bottom surface 5b and two opposing side walls 6 and<br>
is surrounded on the bottom and on the sides by standard mineral thermal insulation<br>
material 7. At the end of the flow channel 1 there is an extraction point 8 for the<br>
production glass, installed at a lower level than the bottom surface 5b. Control<br>
equipment for continuous or discontinuous delivery of the molten glass is not shown at<br>
the extraction point. The complete bottom part la of the flow channel 1 is supported on<br>
a frame 9.<br>
[0043] Drainage equipment 20 for the so-called bottom glass is installed upstream of<br>
the production glass extraction point 8. The main element of this equipment is a<br>
drainage slit 21 that runs perpendicular to the flow direction 2 and is symmetrical about<br>
the vertical axis II-II. Variations of the design principles are detailed in FIGS. 2, 3, 4<br>
and 5, using the same reference numbers.<br>
[0044] In the example shown in FIG. 2 two horizontal electrodes 22 are installed<br>
opposite one another, the front end surfaces 22a of which are located above the inlet<br>
opening 21a of the drainage slit 21. From this inlet opening 21a two symmetrical<br>
sloping surfaces 21b lead to the cylindrical drainage opening 23, below which a circular<br>
electrode plate 24 with a connection cable 25 is installed. A pressure spring at the rear<br>
end of the electrodes 22 puts the front end surfaces 22a under compression. On account<br><br>
of the short distance between the end surfaces 22a and the interface between the inner<br>
lining 5a and the molten glass 3 the majority of the electrical current flows directly to<br>
the molten glass 3 and from there to the drainage slit 21 and through the drainage<br>
opening 23 to the electrode plate 24.<br>
[0045] Owing to the temperature range normally used for such processes, the molten<br>
glass has an even lower electrical resistance coefficient than the material of the inner<br>
lining 5a which is at an even lower temperature. Therefore a significant part of the<br>
energy develops in the bottom area of the flow channel 1 and in particular inside the<br>
drainage slit 21, and this leads to a significant improvement in the run-off of the<br>
problematic zircon-containing bottom glass, the viscosity of which is higher than that<br>
of the production glass at comparable temperatures.<br>
[0046] In the example shown in figures FIGS. 3 and 5, two electrodes 26 are installed<br>
horizontally opposite one another, with their front end surfaces 26a below the inlet<br>
opening 21a of the drainage slit 21. From this inlet opening 21a two symmetrical<br>
sloping surfaces 21b lead to the cylindrical drainage opening 23, below which a circular<br>
electrode plate 24 with a connecting cable 25 is installed. A pressure spring at the rear<br>
end of the electrodes 26 puts the front end surfaces 26a under compression. On account<br>
of the short distance between the front end surfaces 26a and the interface between the<br>
inner lining 5a and the molten glass 3 the majority of the electrical current flows<br>
directly to the molten glass 3 and from there to the drainage slit 21 and through the<br>
drainage opening 23 to the electrode plate 24, indicated by thick lines in FIG. 5.<br>
[0047] It is particularly preferable if the horizontal axes of the electrodes 22 and 26 -<br>
all at the same height - are in line with axis II-II (FIG. 1) and of course the design<br>
principles of FIGS. 2 and 3 can also be combined with one another, i.e., the drainage<br>
slit 21 would then be fitted with two pairs of electrodes 22 and 26. In principle FIGS. 2<br>
and 3 are laid one upon the other.<br>
[0048] Owing to the temperature range normally used for such processes the molten<br>
glass has an even lower electrical resistance coefficient than the material of the inner<br>
lining 5a which is at an even lower temperature. Therefore a significant part of the<br>
energy develops inside the drainage slit 21, and this leads to a significant improvement<br>
in the run-off of the problematic zircon-containing bottom glass, the viscosity of which<br>
is higher than that of the production glass at comparable temperatures.<br><br>
[0049] FIG. 4 uses the same reference numbers and shows a 3-dimensional view of the<br>
main elements near the inner lining 5a with the slit-shaped drain 21 and its inlet<br>
opening 21a. It can be seen that the drainage slit 21, that extends perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal or flow direction of the flow channel, is basically as long as the total width<br>
of the horizontal and flat bottom surface 5b. As a result, the bottom glass is prevented<br>
from reaching the production glass extraction point 8. The transitions from the bottom<br>
surface 5b to both side walls 6 are well rounded. Such an inner lining 5a can also be<br>
described as a drain block.<br>
[0050] In addition FIG. 5 shows the following: curved, thick lines are used to indicate<br>
the current paths that emanate from the two electrodes 26 that are of the same polarity.<br>
The main current transfer to the inner lining 5a takes place via the front end surfaces<br>
26a of the electrodes 26 that are under spring pressure in the direction shown by the<br>
arrow. As most molten glasses still have a lower specific electrical resistance than the<br>
inner lining 5a that is either at the same or a lower temperature, most of the current<br>
flows through the surface of the inner lining 5a that has glass contact directly into the<br>
glass and through this in the direction of the drainage opening 23 and the electrode<br>
plate 24. Only a relatively small proportion of the current flows through the inner lining<br>
5a. The glass in the immediate vicinity of the front end surfaces 26a and the inner<br>
lining 5a and the glass in the drainage slit 21 conduct the current directly to the<br>
drainage opening 23 and the electrode plate 24. The angle "a "of the sloping surfaces<br>
21b is shown as 24 degrees in the drawing and can lie between 15 and 45 degrees.<br>
[0051] This brings the following advantages: firstly there are no longer any metal<br>
electrodes that are surrounded by the glass and become corroded. As a result, no<br>
complex reactions that lead to the formation of a contact layer take place on the<br>
electrode surface. This layer is comprised of several components, in the main however,<br>
from compounds of molybdenum or zircon and oxygen or sulphur. Although the layer<br>
is basically thin, changes in operating conditions can cause erosion to some of the layer,<br>
and this appears as a dark mark in the production glass. Oxygen bubbles frequently<br>
occur simultaneously or as a consequence of such reactions.<br>
[0052] Secondly, the flow channel 1 and in particular the drainage slit 21 are free of<br>
any obstacle that cause a disturbance or problems, so the bottom glass with its cords<br>
can flow unimpeded across the whole width and evenly from the bottom surface 5b and<br>
the side walls 6 to the drainage opening 23.<br><br>
[0053] The diagram in FIG. 6 shows temperature values from 800 to 1500 Â°C on the<br>
abscissa and on the ordinate the values for the specific electrical resistance between 1<br>
and 10 ohm.cm for various mineral materials and glass types that are found in a glass<br>
melting furnace. It should be noted that the ordinate is divided into orders of magnitude<br>
and that the curves for ZAC 1681 and ZAC 1711 are nearer to the curves for certain<br>
glasses than other mineral materials used in furnace building. Incidentally, the terms<br>
ZAC 1681 and ZAC 1711 are the same as ER 1681 and ER 1711 used by Trier. In<br>
contrast the values for sillimanite and zircon mullite are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude<br>
above those of the fusion cast materials mentioned, so they cannot be considered to be<br>
electricity conductors.<br>
[0054] ZAC 1681 material is comprised of solid crystals, held together by a "glass".<br>
This glass forms approximately 20 % of the complete block and among other things it<br>
is responsible for the main part of the electrical conductivity. This in turn leads to the<br>
conclusion that the current is not conducted evenly through a block, but through the<br>
limited volume of the glassy phase, which inevitably is then heated slightly more than<br>
the main mass of the block. However, despite this fact, the temperatures within the<br>
inner layer 5 a are much lower during operation than the temperatures at which the<br>
glassy phase could become liquid and capable of flow.<br>
[0055] In short, the invention concerns a process and apparatus for the extraction of<br>
molten glass (3) from flow channels (1), that lead to an extraction point (8) for<br>
production glass, whereby the flow channel (1) has a glass-resistant inner lining (5a)<br>
and whereby a drainage unit (20) for bottom glass is installed upstream of the<br>
extraction point (8) for the production glass. In order to protect electrodes (22, 26) from<br>
the molten glass (3), but still have a local and temporal influence on the temperature<br>
profile within the flow cross-section, in accordance with the invention the following is<br>
suggested:<br>
[0056] a) at least in the area of the drainage opening (20) the inner lining (5a) is<br>
made of a fusion cast, electrically conductive material and has a drainage opening (23)<br>
for the bottom glass with a drainage slit (21) above, and that<br>
[0057] b) at least two electrodes (22, 26) are installed on opposite sides of the flow<br>
channel (1) and the drainage unit (20), and the front end surfaces (22a) of these<br>
electrodes are inserted so far into the inner layer (5a) in the direction of the molten<br><br>
glass (3) that the majority of the electric current flows through the molten glass (3) to<br>
an electrode plate (24).<br>
[0058] From the above description, it is apparent that the objects of the present<br>
invention have been achieved. While only certain embodiments have been set forth,<br>
alternative embodiments and various modifications will be apparent from the above<br>
description to those skilled in the art. These and other alternatives are considered<br>
equivalents and within the spirit of scope of the present invention. It should be<br>
understood that I wish to embody within the scope of the patent warranted heron all<br>
such modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of my<br>
contribution to the art.<br>
