Bifunctional phenyl iso(thio)cyanates, processes and intermediates for their preparation<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing bifunctional phenyl iso(thio)cyanates of the formula I having an acylsulfonamide group<br><br>
where the variables are as defined below:<br>
W   is oxygen or sulfur,<br>
Ar  is phenyl which may be mono- or polysubstituted by the<br>
following groups: hydrogen, halogen, Ci-C4-haloalkyl or cyano, A   is a radical derived from a primary or secondary amine or is<br>
NH2/<br>
by reacting anilines or their hydrochlorides with phosgene derivatives. The invention also relates to bifunctional phenyl iso(thio)cyanates.<br>
Iso(thio)cyanatobenzoylsulfamic acid amides are potential precursors for the preparation of crop protection agents having a triazole-3,5-dion-4-yl group, pyrimidine-2,6-dion-l-yl group or 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-trion-l-yl group or their S analogs as described, for example, in WO 01/83459. Owing to their reactivity, it should be easy to convert the iso(thio)cyanato structural unit into other groups such as (thio)urea or urethane groups. However, for the reasons mentioned below, their preparation was thought to be impossible.<br>
In principle, phenyl iso(thio)cyanates can be prepared by reacting primary aromatic amines with phosgene and thiophosgene, respectively (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [methods of organic chemistry], 4th edition, Vol. IX, pp. 869, 875-877 and Vol. VIII, pp. 120-124). Further general processes are known, for example, from EP 70389, EP 75267 and EP 409 025.<br><br>
Common to all of the processes described is that the phenyl iso(thio)cyanates used do not carry an acylsulfonamide group. This is because it is known that an iso(thio)cyanato group can react with a sulfonamide group with formation of sulfonylureas. Thus, for example, J. Cervello and T. Sastre describe, in Synthesis 1990, 221-222, the reaction of a sulfonamide with isocyanates according to the equation below:<br><br>
US 4,309,209 discloses that phenyl isocyanates react with chloromethane- (N-methyl) sulfonamide (= CICH2SO2NHCH3) with formation of a 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-l,1,3-trione. P. Schwenkkraus and H.-H. Otto describe, in Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) , 326 (1993), 437 - 441, the reaction of 3-haloalkyl-p-sultames with phenyl isocyanate with formation of carbamoyl compounds.<br>
DE 3433391 discloses the reaction of saccharin with acyl isocyanates to give N-acylated saccharin derivatives.<br>
In JZV Akad Nauk SSSR, Ser Khim 1990, 2874 (English translation: Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Division of Chemical Sciences, Vol. 39, (1990), p. 2610), B. A. Arbuzov, N. N. Zobova and N. R. Fedotava describe the N- and O-acylation of saccharin by reaction with a trifluoroacetyl isocyanate.<br>
Against this background, both the preparation of phenyl iso (thio) cyanates which, in the same molecule, also carry a reactive acylsulfonamide function and their isolation - without subsequent intermolecular reactions -  have been thought to be impossible. A person skilled in the art would have assumed that, owing to their acidic proton, sulfonamides would react with phenyl iso(thio)cyanates to give sulfonylurea derivatives. Hitherto, no process for the preparation of phenyl iso(thio)cyanates which, as further functional group, carry an acylsulfonamide group has been described.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
iso(thio)cyanatobenzoylsulfamic acid amides of the formula I.<br><br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by a process in which an aminobenzoylsulfamic acid amide of the formula II<br><br>
where the variables Ar and A are as defined above is reacted with phosgene, diphosgene or thiophosgene.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing phenyl iso(thio)cyanates of the formula I which comprises reacting a compound of the formula II or its HC1 adduct with phosgene, thiophosgene or diphosgene (see Scheme 1). In Scheme 1, the variables Ar, A and W are as defined above.<br>
Scheme 1:<br><br>
The phenyl iso(thio)cyanates I obtainable in high yield by the process according to the invention are useful intermediates for the preparation of crop protection agents, in particular of 3-(triazolidinone)-substituted phenylsulfamoylcarboxamides. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for preparing 3-heterocyclyl-substituted phenylsulfamoylcarboxamides starting with phenyl iso(thio)cyanates I. Contrary to expectation, the compounds I according to the invention are stable compounds which are readily prepared, even on an industrial scale. Accordingly, the invention also relates to the phenyl iso(thio)cyanates of the formula I. The stability of the compounds I according to the invention is surprising, since a person skilled in the art would have expected an intermolecular reaction between the iso(thio)cyanato structural unit and the sulfamide grouping to take place.<br>
The organic molecular moieties mentioned in the definition of the substituents are - like the term halogen - collective terms for individual enumerations of the individual group members, where<br><br>
bhe term Cn-Cm indicates the possible number of carbon atoms in the molecular moiety. All carbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties, may be straight-chain or branched. Unless indicated otherwise, halogenated substituents preferably carry Dne to six identical or different halogen atoms. In each case, bhe term "halogen" denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

where the variables Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, A and W are as defined above.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to the preparation of the compounds IA.l where A is NR1R2. Hereinbelow, these compounds are referred to as compounds IA.l.<br><br>
The reaction of the compound II with phosgene, thiophosgene or diphosgene, hereinbelow also referred to as phosgenating agent, is usually carried out in an inert organic solvent. Suitable solvents for these reactions are - depending on the temperature range - hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as<br><br>
methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-ciichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, chlorobenzene, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-dichlorobenzene, ethers, such as 1,4-dioxane, anisole; glycol ethers, such as dimethyl glycol ether, diethyl glycol ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; esters, such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, methyl isobutyrate, isobutyl acetate; carboxamides, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone; nitrated hydrocarbons, such as nitrobenzene; tetraalkylureas such as tetraethylurea, tetrabutylurea, dimethylethyleneurea, dimethylpropyleneurea; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile or isobutyronitrile; or else mixtures of individual solvents.<br>
If phosgene is used, preference is given to using a solvent which is substantially free of protic impurities such as water and alcohols. However, in the preparation of the isothiocyanates, it is also possible, similarly to Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th edition. Vol. IX, p. 875, to carry out the reaction of II with thiophosgene in a two-phase system comprising water and a water-immiscible organic solvent, or else in water.<br>
In general, the compound II is initially charged in a reaction vessel, preferably as a solution or suspension in one of the solvents mentioned above, and the phosgenating agent is then added. The addition of the phosgenating agent is preferably carried out with stirring. The addition preferably takes place over a period of from 10 to 60 minutes. The phosgenating agent can be added as such or as a solution in one of the solvents mentioned above. In the case of phosgene, this is generally introduced into the solution or suspension.<br>
The reaction temperature will generally not exceed 180°C, preferably 120°C and in particular 100°C, and will generally be at least 40°C and preferably at least 50°C. Frequently, at least the major part of the phosgenating agent will be added at a low temperature, for example in the range from 0 to 40°C, in particular from 10 to 40°C and especially from 20 to 30°C, and the mixture will be heated during or after the addition to a temperature in the range from 40 to 180°C, in particular from 50 to 120°C and especially from 70 to 100°C, until the reaction has gone to completion.<br>
In general, from 0.9 to 2, preferably from 0.95 to 1.5, with particular preference from 0.98 to 1.09, molar equivalents of phosgenating agent are employed per mole of the compound II.<br><br>
If appropriate, the conversion of II is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases are, for example, basic inorganic compounds, for example alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, bicarbonates or carbonates. However, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of an organic base, for example a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, N-ethyldiisopropylamine, pyridine, a-, (3-, y-picoline, 2,4-, 2,6-lutidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, quinoline or 1 acridine. The base (calculated as base equivalent) can be employed in substoichiometric, superstoichiometric or equimolar amounts, based on the compound II. In general, from 0.01 to 6 mol, preferably from 0.1 to 3 mol, of base are employed per mole of the compound II.<br>
In another embodiment of the process according to the invention, the reaction is carried out in the presence of hydrogen chloride. In this case, the amount of hydrogen chloride is usually from 0.9 to 5.0 mol, preferably from 1.0 to 2.5 mol and in particular from 1.0 to 1.2 mol, of hydrogen chloride per mole of the compound II. The procedure usually adopted here is that the abovementioned amount of gaseous hydrogen chloride is initially introduced into or a solution of hydrogen chloride in a solvent is initially added to a solution or suspension of the compound II in one of the abovementioned solvents, the phosgenating agent is then added in the manner described above and the reaction is then continued in the manner described above. The introduction of hydrogen chloride is usually carried out at temperatures from 10°C to 60°C, preferably from 20°C to 30°C.<br>
If the process is carried out in the presence of hydrogen chloride, it is possible to use activated carbon as the catalyst. The amount of activated carbon is expediently from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 1 to 3% by weight, based on the weight of the compound II.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under superatmospheric pressure, continuously or batch-wise. In general, the reaction of the compound II with a phosgenating agent will be carried out with exclusion of water. If appropriate, it may be advantageous to carry out the reaction under a protective atmosphere.<br>
Work-up to isolate the target product can be carried out using the methods customary for this purpose. If the phosgenating agent used is phosgene, in general unreacted phosgene will initially be removed, for example by introducing a stream of nitrogen into the<br><br>
reaction mixture. The solvent is then removed by customary processes, for example by distillation. For further purification, it is possible to employ processes such as crystallization or chromatography, for example on silica gel. If appropriate, the residue can also be purified by trituration with a solvent, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene or xylene, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, an ether, such as diethyl ether, etc., and mixtures of these.<br>
The compounds of the formula II required as starting materials for carrying out the process according to the invention are likewise novel and, as interesting precursors, of importance for the process according to the invention. In the formula II, the variables Ar and A preferably denote those radicals which have already been mentioned in connection with the description of the compounds I according to the invention as being preferred for these substituents.<br>
The compounds of the formula II can be obtained analogously to known processes for preparing anilines. The aniline compounds of the formula II can be prepared, for example, in accordance with Scheme 2 by initially reacting an aroyl compound of the formula III with a sulfamic acid amide IV in a condensation reaction to give an N-aroylsulfamic acid amide of the formula V, followed by reduction of the resulting N-aroylsulfamic acid amide V to give the compound II.<br>
Scheme 2:<br><br><br>
In Scheme 2, the variables A and Ar have the meanings given above, in particular the meanings given as being preferred. X is halogen, preferably chlorine, hydroxyl or a Ci~C4-alkoxy group. The condensation of aroyl compounds of the formula III with sulfamic acid amides of the formula IV to give the corresponding benzoylsulfamides of the formula V is carried out similarly to known processes, for example as described in WO 01/83459, pp. 31-35, in the not yet published German patent application DE 102 21 910.0, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by way of reference.<br>
The first reaction step is illustrated in more detail below:<br>
If X in the formula III is hydroxyl, the carboxylic acid III is preferably initially activated by reaction with a coupling agent. The activated carboxylic acid III is then, generally without prior isolation, reacted with the sulfamic acid amide IV. Suitable coupling agents are, for example, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole or carbodiimides, such as 1 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These are generally employed in at least equimolar amount and up to a four-fold excess, based on the carboxylic acid III. If appropriate, the resulting reaction mixture of carboxylic acid III and coupling agent is heated and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction is usually carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane; ethers, for example dialkyl ethers, such as diethyl ether or methyl tert-butyl ether, or cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; carboxamides, such as dimethylformamide; N-methyllactams, such as N-methylpyrrolidone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene; aromatic amines, such as pyridine; or mixtures of these. This is followed by addition of the sulfamic acid amide IV. In general, the sulf amide IV is dissolved in the same solvent that is used for activating the carboxylic acid.<br>
If X in the formula III is Ci-C4-alkoxy, the esters can initially be converted according to known processes by hydrolysis in an acidic medium using strong mineral acids, such as concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or organic acids, such as glacial acetic acid, or mixtures of these, into the corresponding carboxylic acids III. Alternatively, esters can also be hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions using bases such as alkali metal hyroxide, for example sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in the presence of water.<br><br>
The carboxylic acids III (X = OH) can then be reacted in the manner described above or initially be converted into the acid chlorides (X = CI) using a chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride or phosgene, followed by reaction of the acid chlorides with IV in the manner described below. The acid chlorides are prepared similarly to known processes, for example as described in EP 1 176 133 and WO 01/087872.<br>
However, it is also possible to react the carboxylic acid ester of the formula III in which X is Ci-C4-alkoxy directly with a sulfamic acid amide IV or a metal salt thereof in an amidation reaction with cleavage of the ester radical. The reaction is carried out similarly to the procedure described in Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Vol. VIII, pp. 658 - 659.<br>
If X in formula III is halogen, the aroyl compound III, preferably diluted in an inert solvent, will generally be added to the sulfamic acid amide of the formula IV, preferably likewise diluted in an inert solvent. It is, of course, also possible to initially charge the aroyl compound III and to add the sulfamic acid amide IV.<br>
The molar ratios in which the starting materials III and IV are reacted with one another are generally from 0.9 to 1.2, preferably from 0.95 to 1.1, particularly preferably from 0.98 to 1.04, for the ratio of aroyl compound III to sulfamic acid amide IV.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures in the range from -30 to 100°C, preferably from -10 to 80°C, particularly preferably from 0 to 60°C.<br>
The first reaction step is advantageously carried out under neutral conditions. If an acidic reaction product, for example hydrogen chloride (if X in formula III is halogen) is formed during the reaction, this is removed by addition of a basic compound. Suitable basic compounds include inorganic and organic bases. Suitable inorganic basic compounds are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, bicarbonates or carbonates. However, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of an organic base, for example triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, N-ethyldiisopropylamine, pyridine, a-, |3-, y-picoline, 2,4-, 2,6-lutidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, quinoline or ! acridine. In general, an excess of base is employed, based on the compound III. The molar amount of base is from 1.0 to 2 mol, preferably from 1.02 to 1.3 mol, of base (calculated as base<br><br>
equivalent) per mole of the compound III. If appropriate, the reaction mixture contains pyridine or a pyridine compound, for example a 4-dialkylaminopyridine such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine, as catalyst. The added quantity of catalyst is about 0.1 - 10%, based on the compound III.<br>
The reaction of the aroyl compounds III with the compounds of the formula IV is advantageously carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents for these reactons are - depending on the temperature range - hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, chlorobenzene, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-dichlorobenzene; ethers, such as 1,4-dioxane, anisole, glycol ethers, such as dimethyl glycol ether, diethyl glycol ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; esters, such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, methyl isobutyrate, isobutyl acetate; carboxamides, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, nitrated hydrocarbons, such as nitrobenzene; tetraalkylureas, such as tetraethylurea, tetrabutylurea, dimethylethyleneurea, dimethylpropyleneurea; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide; sulfones, such as dimethyl sulfone, diethyl sulfone, tetramethylene sulfone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile or isobutyronitrile; water; or else mixtures of individual solvents.<br>
It is furthermore possible to carry out the reaction in an aqueous two-phase system, preferably in the presence of phase-transfer catalysts such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. Suitable reaction conditions for the two-phase reaction are those described in EP-A 556737.<br>
Suitable for use as phase-transfer catalysts are quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. Suitable compounds which may be mentioned are the following: tetraalkyl- (Ci-Cis) -ammonium chlorides, bromides or fluorides,<br>
N-benzyltrialkyl- (Ci-Cig) -ammonium chlorides, bromides or fluorides, tetraalkyl- (Ci-Cis) -phosphonium chlorides or bromides, tetraphenylphosponium chloride or bromide,<br>
(phenyl) 0 (Ci-Ci8-alkyl)p-phosponi\im chlorides or bromides, where o = 1 to 3, p = 3 to 1 and o + p = 4. Particular preference is given to tetraethylammonium chloride and N-benzyltriethylammonium chloride. The amount of phase-transfer catalyst is generally up to 20% by weight, preferably from 1 to 15% by weight and particularly preferably from 2 to 8% by weight, based on the starting material IV.<br><br>
The aroyl compound III is advantageously added over a period of from 0.25 to 2 hours to a mixture of the sulfamic acid amide IV and, if appropriate, the base in one of the abovementioned solvents, and the mixture is stirred for another 0.5 to 16 hours, preferably 2 to 8 hours, until the reaction has gone to completion. The reaction temperature is generally from 0°C to 60°C.<br>
If an aqueous two-phase system is used, the starting materials III and IV can be added in any order with stirring to a mixture of the phase-transfer catalyst in the two phases, and the reaction can then be completed in the indicated temperature range by adding a base.<br>
The reaction can be carried out continuously or batch-wise, at atmospheric pressure or under elevated pressure.<br>
For work-up, the organic phase is extracted with dilute mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, the organic phase is dried and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. If appropriate, the residue can also be purified further by trituration with a solvent or solvent mixture, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, xylene or toluene, or an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, such as petroleum ether, pentane, hexane or cyclohexane, an ether such as diethyl ether, etc., and mixtures of these, filtration with suction and drying.<br>
The 2nd reaction step, i.e. the reduction of the nitro compound V to the compound II, is illustrated in more detail below.<br>
The reduction of the compound V to the compound II can be effected, for example, using nascent hydrogen. To this end, the nitro compound is reacted with an acid in the presence of a base metal. According to their nature, base metals are dissolved by a Bronsted acid with evolution of hydrogen. Such metals generally have a normal potential of 
 <br>
The reaction conditions correspond substantially to the reaction conditions used for reducing aliphatic or aromatic nitro groups to aliphatic or aromatic amino groups with nascent hydrogen (see, for example, H. Koopman, Rec. Trav. 80 (1961), 1075; see also N. Kornblum, L. Fischbein, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, (1955) 6266).<br>
Depending on the type of metal and acid, the reaction temperature is generally in the range of from -20 to +120°C, with temperatures in the range of from 50 to 100°C being preferred if alkanoic acids such as acetic acid are used. The reaction time can be from a few minutes to a number of hours, for example from about 20 minutes to 5 hours. Preferably, the compound V to be reduced is initially charged to the reaction vessel and the metal in question is then, preferably in finely divided form, in particular as a powder, added with mixing to the reaction mixture. The addition is preferably carried out over a period of from 10 minutes to 2 hours. It is, of course, also possible to initially charge the metal and the acid and to add the compound V, if appropriate together with an inert solvent. Frequently, the reaction mixture is allowed some extra reaction time at reaction temperature, for example from 10 minutes to 4 hours.<br>
The reduction of V to II is preferably carried out using iron powder in dilute acid. Suitable acids are mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, or organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid. Preference is given to using acetic acid. The amount of iron powder is preferably from 2 to 5 mol, in particular from 2 .5 to 4 mol, per mole of the compound V. The amount of acid is generally not critical. It is expedient to use an at least equimolar amount of acid, based on the nitro compound V, to reduce the starting material as completely as possible. The reaction can be carried out continuously or batch-wise. In this case, the reaction temperatures are in the range of from 50 to 100°C, preferably from 65 to 75°C. In one embodiment, for example, the iron powder is initially charged in acetic acid and the compound V is then added to the reaction vessel. The addition is preferably carried out over a period of from 20 to 60 minutes, with mixing of the components, for example by stirring. After the addition has ended, the mixture is allowed to react at reaction temperature for another 0.5 to 2 hours, preferably for about 1 hour. However, it is also possible to add the iron powder with stirring to the mixture of the compound V in glacial acetic acid and to bring the reaction to completion as described above.<br><br>
Work-up for the isolation of the target product can be carried out by processes customary for this purpose. In general, the solvent is initially removed, for example by distillation. For further purification, it is possible to employ customary processes such as crystallization, chromatography, for example on silica gel, trituration with a solvent, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene or xylene, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, a carboxylic ester, such as ethyl acetate, etc., and mixtures of these.<br>
Suitable reducing agents are furthermore also metal hyrides and semimetal hydrides, such as aluminum hydride and hydrides derived therefrom, such as lithium aluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride; borohydrides, such as diborane and boranates derived therefrom, such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride. To this end, the nitro compound V is, in an inert solvent, brought into contact with the complex metal hydride at 10-65°C, advantageously at 20-50°C. The reaction time is preferably from 2 to 10 hours, advantageously from 3 to 6 hours. Reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent which is inert to the reducing agent. Suitable solvents are - depending on the chosen reducing agent - for example alcohols, e.g. Ci-C4-alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol or n-butanol, and their mixtures with water, or ethers, such as diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In general, from 0.5 to 3, advantageously from 0.75 to 2.5, mol of metal hydride, semimetal hydride, borohydride or boranate are employed per mole of nitro compound V. The process follows the procedure described in Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1976, 15th edition, pp. 612-616.<br>
A further reducing agent suitable for converting the compound V into the compound II is hydrogen in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition metals or transition metal compounds, in particular those of the 8th transition group. Preferred transition metals are, for example, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium or rhodium. The transition metals can be employed as such or in supported form. Examples of supports are activated carbon, alumina, ZrC&gt;2, TiC&gt;2/ SiC&gt;2, carbonates and the like. The transition metals can also be employed in the form of activated metals such as Raney nickel. The transition metals can also be used in the form of compounds. Suitable transition metal compounds are, for example, palladium oxide and platinum oxide. The catalysts are generally employed in an amount of from 0.05 to<br><br>
10.0 mol% (calculated as metal) , based on the compound V to be reduced. The reaction is carried out either in the absence of a solvent or in an inert solvent or diluent. Solvents or diluents suitable for the reaction are, depending on the solubility of the substrate to be hydrated and the chosen reducing agent, for example carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, or aqueous solutions of organic acids, such as acetic acid and water, carboxylic acid esters, such as ethyl acetate, Ci-C4-alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene. Following removal of the catalyst, the reaction solution can be worked up in a customary manner to afford the product. The hydration can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under an elevated hydrogen pressure, for example at a hydrogen pressure of from 0.01 to 50 bar, preferably from 0.1 to 40 bar. For the catalytic hydration of aromatic nitro compounds, see, for example, Rylander in "Catalytic Hydrogenation over Platinum Metals", Academic Press, New York, 1967, 168-202; Furst et al., Chem. Rev. 65 (1965), 52; Tepko et al., J. Org. Chem. 45, (1980), 4992.<br>
In the case of chlorine-containing benzoylsulfamides, the hydration is, depending on the sensitivity of the substituents, carried out at from 20 to 170°C, expediently at from 20 to 140°C, advantageously at from 20 to 80°C. In the case of reactive halogen substituents, it is furthermore recommended to carry out the hydration in neutral solution, preferably at only slightly elevated pressure, using small amounts of nickel, platinum or else rhodium catalysts; also suitable are noble metal sulfides, such as platinum sulfide. The process is described in detail in Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vol. IV/1C, pp. 520-526.<br>
The reduction of the compound V to the compound II can also be carried out using sodium sulfide, advantageously in aqueous ammonia solution, in the presence of ammonium chloride, in accordance with the process described in Org. Syn., Coll. Vol., 3 (1955), 82. The reaction temperature is generally from 40 to 90°C, preferably from 60 to 80°C. Expediently, from 3 to 4 mol of sodium sulfide are employed per mol of nitro compound V.<br>
The aroyl compounds III used in Scheme 2 can be obtained by processes known in the prior art or be prepared similarly to known processes, for example in accordance with US 6,251,829, EP 415 641, EP 908 457, EP 1176133 and WO 01/087872.<br><br>

The bifunctional phenyl iso(thio)cyanates I according to the Invention can be used as starting materials for pharmacologically active compounds or crop protection agents. WO 01/83459, for example, describes herbicidal 3-(triazolidinedione)-substituted oenzoic acid sulfamoyl amides of the formula below<br><br>
where X1 is hydrogen, halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl, X2 is hydrogen, CN, CS-NH2, halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-haloalkyl, R11 and R21 have the meanings given above for R1 and R2, respectively, and are in particular hydrogen, unsubstituted or substituted hydroxyl, Ci-Cio-alkyl, C2-Ci0-alkenyl, C3-Cio-alkynyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl or Cs-Cvcycloalkenyl, or R11 and R21 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 3- to 7-membered heterocyclic ring, and Q is a radical of the formula a<br>
  (a)<br>
where W is as defined above, W is 0 or S and R3 and R4 independently of one another are one of the radicals below: hydrogen, cyano, amino, Ci-Ce-alkyl, Ci-Ce-haloalkyl, Ci-Ce-haloalkoxy, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, C2-Cg-alkenyl, C2-C6-haloalkenyl, C3-C6-alkynyl, benzyl, OR5 (where R5 is hydrogen, Ci-Ce-alkyl, Ci-C6~haloalkyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, C2_C6-alkenyl, Ca-Ce-alkynyl, unsubstituted or substituted phenyl or unsubstituted or substituted benzyl), Ci-C3-cyanoalkyl, or R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atoms to which they are attached form a four- to seven-membered heterocycle which is optionally interrupted by sulfur, oxygen, a group NR6 (where R6 is as defined above) or nitrogen and which is unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted by halogen or Ci-C4-alkyl,<br><br>
and is in particular a radical of the formula b:<br><br>
where W is as defined above and W and Z independently of one another are oxygen or sulfur.<br>
The herbicides described in WO 01/83459 are not always obtainable in sufficient yields and purity. The processes described therein are based, for example:<br>
A)      on the condensation of a substituted benzoic acid with a substituted sulfamic acid amide in the presence of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or the conversion of the carboxylic acid into its acid chloride and subsequent reaction of the acid chloride with the sulfamic acid amide.<br><br>
Here, the variables R11, R21, X1 and X2 may have the meanings mentioned above, and Q is a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle, for example a radical a or b.<br>
This process has the disadvantage that the benzoic acid used can only be obtained from the ester precursor by cleavage with boron tribromide, with the corresponding amount of salt being produced. Moreover, the yield of the condensation with sulfamic acid amides is only from 16 to 45%. Even the detour via an acid chloride, prepared beforehand, gives the desired benzoylsulfamic acid amide in a yield of only 26%, and in addition, its impurities have to be removed chromatographically.<br><br>
B)  The substitution of a halogen radical by the heterocyclic radical Q:<br><br>
Here, the variables R11, R21, X1 and X2 may have the meanings mentioned above, Hal is fluorine, chlorine or bromine and Q is a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle, for example a radical a or b.<br>
This process has the disadvantages that the halogenated aromatic compound used has to be provided in a complicated manner via a Sandmeyer reaction, and moreover an unsatisfactory selectivity in the reaction of the 5-halo-substituted compound, compared to the - activated -2,4-dihalosubstituents present in the same molecule.<br>
Accordingly, all of the prior-art processes for preparing 3- (triazolidinedione) -substituted benzoylsulfamoylamides and their sulfur analogs are unsatisfactory with respect to a short reaction time, a simple practice of the reaction, yields and purity of the end products, and are therefore uneconomical.<br>
Accordingly, it is another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing compounds of the formula VI,<br>
T.T<br>
  (VI)<br>
where W, Ar and A are as defined in claim 1, W is 0 or S and R3 and R4 independently of one another are hydrogen, cyano, amino, Ci-Ce-alkyl, Ci-C6-haloalkyl, Ci-Ce-haloalkoxy, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, C2-C6~alkenyl, C2-Ce-haloalkenyl, C3-C6-alkynyl, benzyl, OR5 (where R5 is hydrogen, Ci-Cg-alkyl, Ci-Cg-haloalkyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, C2-Ce-alkenyl, ^-Ce-alkynyl, unsubstituted or substituted phenyl<br><br>
or unsubstituted or substituted benzyl), Ci-C3-cyanoalkyl, or R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atoms to which they are attached form a four- to seven-membered heterocycle which is optionally interrupted by sulfur, oxygen, a group NR6 (where R6 is as defined above) or nitrogen and which is unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted by halogen or Ci~C4-alkyl.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that, starting with the compounds of the formula I according to the invention, in particular the compounds of the formula IA, it is possible to prepare the compounds of the formula VI described in WO 01/83459 in a much more simple manner, without side reactions and in higher yields and purity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula VI<br>
  (VI)<br>
where R3, R4, W, W, Ar, A are as defined above<br>
which comprises the following steps<br>
(i) reaction of a compound of the formula I as defined above with an oxadiazinecarboxylic acid ester of the formula VII,<br>
  (VII)<br>
where W is as defined above and R' is Ci-C4-alkyl, giving a urea derivative of the formula VIII<br>
  :)<br><br>
where the variables R3, R4, R', W, W, Ar and A are as defined above, and<br>
(ii) cyclization of the resulting intermediate VIII, giving a compound of the formula VI.<br>
Step (i) is carried out in a manner known per se, for example as described in WO 02/20531. In general, the iso(thio)cyanate of the formula I according to the invention is added to a compound of the formula VII, preferably in a solvent.

In the case of thioureas of the formula VIII (W = S), the reaction is generally substantially complete (conversion &gt; 90%) after 0.5-10 hours, and in the case ureas of the formula VIII (W = 0) after 4-48 hours and in particular after 8-24 hours. However, it is also possible to initially charge the base,<br><br>
preferably in one of the solvents mentioned above, followed by addition of the compound VIII and conclusion of the reaction as above.<br>
The concentration of the starting materials in the solvent is generally in the range from 0.5 to 5 mol/1, preferably in the range from 0.2 to 2 mol/1.<br>
