INTRODUCTION<br>
Cross reference to related applications<br>
This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) to application<br>
serial no. 60/986,237, filed November 7, 2007, the content of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical/formulation chemistry. The<br>
invention is understood to apply generally to formulations of hydrolytically unstable<br>
compounds. As a preferred embodiment, provided herein are higher density, hydrolytically<br>
stable formulations of (6-(5-fluoro-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylamino) pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-<br>
2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-2H-pyrido[3,2-b][l,4]oxazin-4(3H)-yl)methyl phosphate disodium salt<br>
(Compound 1) prepared by a wet granulation process. Such formulations inhibit<br>
degradation of Compound 1 during prolonged storage under ambient conditions. The<br>
formulations are useful for treating a variety of diseases including, but not limited to,<br>
lymphoma, immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and rheumatoid arthritis<br>
(RA).<br>
State of the Art<br>
Compound 1 is currently in clinical studies for the treatment of a variety of<br>
diseases such as lymphoma, ITP and RA. Dosing is currently done with orally delivered<br>
tablets. Two sets of tablets used contain relatively high concentrations of Compound 1, i.e..<br>
50 mg and 100 mg of active.<br>
Compound 1, as synthesized, forms cotton like fluffy agglomerates with a<br>
very low bulk density (-0.15 - 0.30 g/mL). This characteristic confers poor powder flow<br>
and makes direct compression to tablets of the active impractical. Poor powder flow also<br>
results in a wide weight variation within the final product owing to variable fill of tablet<br>
dies, etc. Accordingly, it is desirable to formulate Compound 1 with higher density<br>
excipients such as fillers, binders, disintegrants, etc. which increase the bulk density and<br>
render the flow property adequate for compression into tablets.<br>
[0065]"" Granulation is a process well known in the pharmaceutical industry,<br>
involving the preparation of aggregates ("granules") of fine particles of materials. Such<br>
granules are often compacted to form tablets. Formulations of pharmaceutical powders are<br>
granulated for a variety of reasons falling into two main classes: processing and<br>
formulation. Processing reasons are exemplified by the need for densification and<br>
aggregation. A dense, granular material will flow more evenly and fill dies on high speed<br>
tablet machines better and with greater consistency than a simple mixture.<br>
[WMte]-^ One method of making granules is so called "wet granulation." In its<br>
simplest form, wet granulation involves the addition of a granulating fluid, commonly<br>
water, functioning as a granulating liquid, to a stirred powder comprising the materials to be<br>
granulated. The granulating liquid can be used alone or as a solvent containing a binder<br>
(also referred to as a "dissolved adhesive") which is used to ensure particle adhesion once<br>
the granule is dry. If the drying and subsequent handling is done with care, the aggregates<br>
will retain their integrity, giving a material which is both denser and more free flowing than<br>
the original material. Wet granulation has also been carried out with organic solvents or<br>
water-organic solvent mixtures, but organic solvents can present fire or toxicity hazards.<br>
[668ft- Wet granulation adds a significant degree of difficulty especially where the<br>
active agent is sensitive to water or heat. This invention is contemplated for hydrolytically<br>
unstable compounds generally. Compound 1, including its hexahydrate, is water sensitive<br>
and undergoes decomposition according to the following reaction scheme:<br>
<br>
' [0008] Compound 1 is a prodrug of Compound 2. It is preferable, then, that any<br>
wet granulation process employing water be done in a manner where little or no degradation<br>
of Compound 1 occurs either during the granulation, tablet formation, or storage so as to<br>
ensure that the proper systemic levels of Compound 2 are achieved.<br>
[0009J- In addition, it is preferable that the tablets formed be of sufficient hardness<br>
that they can be hand manipulated without breakage but disintegrate rapidly upon<br>
administration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[(HH-ftf^This invention is generally directed to hydrolytically stable formulations of<br>
hydrolytically unstable compounds, in particular to hydrolytically stable formulations of<br>
Compound 1 having a bulk density sufficient to form tablets having a hardness in the range<br>
of about 6 kp to about 30 kp, wherein said formulations are prepared in a wet granulation<br>
process. The formulation is then converted to tablets by conventional compression<br>
techniques. In some embodiments, the tablets have a hardness in the range of about 12 kp<br>
to about 20 kp, more preferably between about 14 kp to about 18 kp. In some preferred<br>
embodiments, the tablets have a hardness of about 16 kp. This invention is further directed<br>
to tablets formed from these hydrolytically stable formulations of Compound 1.<br>
fQM4-j~ In particular, this invention is directed to the surprising and unexpected<br>
result that the inclusion of a higher bulk density, water sequestering agent with Compound 1<br>
in the formulation, allows for use of water in a wet granulation process notwithstanding the<br>
hydrolytic instability of Compound 1.<br>
[jft012j This invention is further directed to the discovery that the bulk density of<br>
the resulting homogenous formulation correlates to compressed tablet hardness and that<br>
control of the bulk density to between about 0.35 g/mL and about 0.65 g/mL, and preferably<br>
between about 0.35 g/mL and about 0.60 g/mL, provides for tablets having a hardness in the<br>
range of about 6 kp to about 30 kp. Such tablets also exhibit at least 75% dissolution in less<br>
than 45 minutes in an aqueous solution maintained at pH 7.4 and a temperature of 37 ยฐC<br>
+0.5 ยฐC.<br>
ยฃ.9013] This invention is still further directed to the discovery that the tablets of<br>
this invention have surprisingly long shelf-life with minimal degradation of Compound 1<br>
during storage under ambient conditions. Accordingly, the tablets so formed are suitable for<br>
oral delivery.<br>
|<qoh in view of the above one its formulation aspects this invention is></qoh>
directed to a wet granulated formulation comprising water, an effective amount of<br>
Compound 1, a sufficient amount of a water sequestering agent to inhibit decomposition of<br>

tablets having a hardness in the range of about 6 kp to about 30 kp.<br>
[QQIS}-7 In one embodiment, the bulk density of the dried formulation is between<br>
about 0.35 g/mL to about 0.65 g/mL and preferably between about 0.35 g/mL to about 0.60<br>
g/mL.<br>
[0016)- In another embodiment, the higher bulk density water sequestering agent is<br>
selected from the group consisting of starch (for example, partially pregelatinized starch),<br>
magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride, silica gel, kaolin and the like. Preferably, starch is<br>
employed and, more preferably, Starch 1500 available from Colorcon, Inc., West Point,<br>
Pennsylvania, USA, is employed. In some embodiments, the starch is derived from Maize<br>
(corn). In a preferred embodiment, the pregelatinized starch is derived from Maize.<br>
{QiHJ}* In another embodiment, the formulation further comprises one or more<br>
fillers such as microcrystalline celluloses (e.g., Avicel PH 102 (FMC Newark, DE 19711).<br>
Emcocel 90M (JRS Pharma Patterson, NY 12563), etc.) and/or one or more lubricants (e.g.,<br>
magnesium stearate) and/or one or more suspending/binding agents (e.g., Plasdone K29/32<br>
(ISP Wayne, NJ 07470)) and/or one or more disintegrants (e.g., Sodium Starch Glycolate<br>
(JRS Pharma Rosenberg, Germany), and the like.<br>
fflOiSf In another aspect, this invention is directed to a tablet comprising water, an<br>
effective amount of Compound 1, and a sufficient amount of a water sequestering agent to<br>
inhibit decomposition of Compound 1, wherein said tablet has a hardness in the range of<br>
about 6 kp to about 30 kp.<br>
{tnJT9j In another embodiment, the tablets of this invention exhibit at least 75%<br>
dissolution in less than 45 minutes in an aqueous solution maintained at pH 7.4 and a<br>
temperature of 37 ยฐC ยฑ0.5 ยฐC.<br>
[00207" ln another embodiment, the tablet further comprises one or more fillers<br>
such as microcrystalline celluloses (e.g., MCC Avicel PH 102, Emcocel 90M, etc.) and/or<br>
one or more lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate) and/or one or more suspending/binding<br>
agents (e.g., Plasdone K29/32) and/or one or more disintegrants (e.g., ExploTab), and the<br>
like.<br>
t{0034^ In one of its method aspects, this invention is directed to a method for<br>

comprises:<br>
a) blending Compound 1 with starch and filler and optionally in the presence of one<br>

powder mixture of a) above and mixing to form enlarged granules; and<br>
c) drying the enlarged granules produced in b) above until an LOD of between about<br>
5% and about 11% is achieved, to provide dried granules.<br>
|fl022^ The dried granules prepared in the methods above are typically between<br>

J0023] In another of its method aspects, this invention further comprises milling<br>
the dried granules. In one embodiment, the dried granules are milled so that about 90<br>
weight percent have a particle size between about 25 um to about 900 um in diameter.<br>
fOO^^f In still another aspect, the dried, milled granules are mixed with a lubricant<br>
until homogenous, and then tabletting the resulting formulation. Suitable lubricants include<br>
stearic acid, colloidal silica and talc.<br>
[0025] The tablets of this invention preferably comprise from about 25 mg to<br>
about 200 mg of Compound 1. More preferably, the tablets comprise between about 50 mg<br>
to about 100 mg of Compound 1 and, even more preferably, about 100 mg of Compound 1.<br>

[QQ45J The term "tablet" is used in its common context, and refers to a solid<br>
composition made by compressing and/or molding a mixture of compositions in a form<br>

Formulations<br>
[Q046] &gt; Prior to tabletting, a wet granulated formulation is prepared, dried, milled<br>
and mixed, etc.<br>
JflJW^J- The wet granulated formulation comprises water, compound 1, and a<br>
sufficient amount of a higher bulk density water sequestering agent, such that after drying<br>
the wet formulation, the bulk density of the formulation is sufficient to provide for tablets<br>
having a hardness of between about 8 kp to about 24 kp.<br>
JQยฃ48f The wet granulated formulation preferably comprises between about 10 to<br>
N about 50 weight percent of Compound 1, about 100 to about 140 weight percent of a water<br>
sequestering agent based on the amount of Compound 1, and between about 90 to about 120<br>
weight percent of water based on the total weight of the dry formulation prior to wet<br>
granulation.<br>
[ยฉ049f Optional additives which can be added to the formulation include one or<br>
more of the following:<br>
a) fillers which, when employed, preferably range between about 30 to about 45<br>
weight percent of the dry formulation prior to wet granulation;<br>
b) suspending/dispersing agents or binding agents which, when employed preferably<br>
range between about 2 to about 5 weight percent of the dry formulation prior to wet<br>
granulation;<br>
c) lubricants which, when employed, range from between about 0.25 and 2.0 weight<br>
percent of the dry formulation prior to wet granulation; and<br>
d) disintegrants which, when employed, range from between about 0.5 and 10.0<br>
weight percent of the dry formulation prior to wet granulation;<br>
each of which is described above.<br>
|0O5Of Preferably, the wet granulated formulation comprises Compound 1, a water<br>
sequestering agent, water, filler, suspending/dispersing agent and a disintegrant.<br>
JlQQSlf The wet formulation can additionally and optionally include a colorant, as<br>
long as it is approved and certified by the FDA. For example, exemplary colors include<br>
allura red, acid fuschin D, naphtalone red B, food orange 8, eosin Y, phyloxine B,<br>
erythrosine, natural red 4, carmine, to name a few.<br>
[Q052J' Sweetening agents can also be added to the formulation or the outer core of<br>
the tablet to create or add to the sweetness. Saccharide fillers and binders, e.g., mannitol,<br>
lactose, and the like, can add to this effect. For example, cyclamates, saccharin, aspartame,<br>
acesulfame K (Mukherjee (1997) Food Chem. Toxicol. 35:1177-1179), or the like (Rolls<br>
(1991) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 53:872-878), can be used. Sweeteners other than sugars have the<br>
advantage of reducing the bulk volume of the tablet (core tablet and/or coat) and not<br>
effecting the physical properties of the tablet.<br>
Manufacturing Processes<br>
[QQSSj"7 The preferred manufacturing process of this invention for wet granulation<br>
comprises preblending all of the required formulation components except water until<br>
homogenous. In one preferred embodiment, preblending is conducted in a granulator such<br>
as a Fielder PMA 300 High Shear Granulator with 36 inch impeller diameter, and<br>
preblending comprises mixing the components together at impellor speeds ranging between<br>
about 30 to about 70 rpm for a period of between about 0.5 to about 5 minutes.<br>
{ยฉ05+f7 Water is then sprayed onto/into the dry composition to form the wet<br>
granulated formulation described herein. The water is preferably added at a constant rate<br>
over a period of from about 1 kg/min to about 5 kg/min with either constant mixing during<br>
addition or mixing after addition. In either event, mixing is continued until the wet<br>
granulated composition is homogenous.<br>
{{1055}'- The wet granulated formulation is then dried using conventional techniques<br>
to reduce water content to a predetermined level. Preferably, the water content of the dried<br>
granulated formulation is between about 5% to about 11% by weight. Drying can be<br>
conducted at various temperatures and times. One skilled in the art could readily determine<br>
the appropriate drying times based on the initial water content, the desired final water<br>
content, and the drying temperature(s) employed.<br>
[J1054j^ The dried granulated formulation is milled using conventional techniques<br>
and machinery. In one embodiment, the formulation is milled through an appropriate mesh<br>
screen using commercially available milling equipment such as, e.g., Quadro Comil 196S<br>
(Quadro, Millbum, NJ).<br>
[905^ In one embodiment, the milled, dried granulated formulation is evaluated<br>
for degree of degradation of Compound 1 to Compound 2 as well as to confirm that the bulk<br>
density of the formulation will provide for tablet hardness of between about 8 to about 24<br>
kp upon compression. Surprisingly, it has been found that the use of water in the wet<br>
granulation process as well as elevated temperatures during the drying protocol, does not<br>
significantly alter the amount of Compound 1 in the formulation. Typically, no more than<br>
1 % by weight of Compound 1 degrades during the granulation and drying process and even<br>
more preferably no more than 0.5% by weight.<br>
{ยฃยฃยง#)? The pressing or compression of the dried, granulated and milled<br>
formulation can be accomplished using any tablet press. Many alternative means to effect<br>
this step are available, and the invention is not limited by the use of any particular<br>
equipment. In a preferred embodiment, the compression step is carried out using a rotary<br>
type tablet press. The rotary type tabletting machine has a rotary board with multiple<br>
through-holes, or dies, for forming tablets. The formulation is inserted into the die and is<br>
subsequently press-molded.<br>
^059f* The diameter and shape of the tablet depends on the die and punches<br>
selected for the compression of the milled and mixed formulation. Tablets can be discoid,<br>
oval, oblong, round, cylindrical, triangular, and the like. The tablets may be scored to<br>
facilitate breaking. The top or lower surface can be embossed or debossed with symbols or<br>
letters.<br>
HMkrftf The compression force can be selected based on the type/model of press, a<br>
desired hardness of the resulting tablets of from about 8 kp to about 24 kp as well as other<br>
attributes, such as friability, disintegration or dissolution characteristics, etc. Preferred<br>
embodiment are described in the Examples below.<br>
Measuring Tablet Properties<br>
({fl^rr}" Tablet hardness is a physical strength measurement of a tablet. The<br>
resistance of a tablet to chipping, abrasion, or breakage under conditions of storage,<br>
transportation, and handling before usage depends on its hardness, or "crushing strength."<br>
The tablet "crushing" or "tensile" strength is defined as the force required to break a tablet<br>
by compression in the radial direction. It is typically measured using one of the many<br>
commonly available tablet hardness testers. For example, "Stokes" and "Monsanto"<br>
hardness testers measure the force required to break the tablet when the force generated by a<br>
coil spring is applied diametrically to the tablet. A "Strong-Cobb" hardness tester also<br>
measures the diametrically applied force required to break a tablet, the force applied by an<br>
air pump forcing a plunger against the tablet placed on an anvil. Electrically operated<br>
hardness testers, such as the Schleuniger apparatus (also known as a "Heberlein") can be<br>
used. See also, TS-50N, Okada Seiko Co., Japan; Bi (1996) Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo)<br>
44:2121-2127.<br>
[0062] Tablet friability is a physical strength measurement of a tablet, and is<br>
defined as the ability of the compressed tablet to resist abrasion and attrition. It is typically<br>
measured by turning tablets in a rotating vessel and determining weight loss (see De Jong<br>
(1987) Pharm Weekbl (Sci) 9:24-28). These rotating devices are called "friabilators." The<br>
friabilator provides frictional abrasion to the tablet sample and is used to measure the<br>
resistance to abrasion or attrition of tablets. The loss of weight is measured after a fixed<br>
number of revolutions of a drum rotating at a controlled rate.<br>
ยฆ[00637" Friabilator apparatus typically use a 285 mm drum of transparent synthetic<br>
polymer with polished internal surfaces. One side of the drum is removable. The tablets<br>
are tumbled at each turn of the drum by a curved projection that extends from the middle of<br>
the drum to the outer wall. The drum is attached to the horizontal axis of a device that<br>
rotates at about 25 to 30 rpm. Thus, at each turn, the tablets roll or slide and fall onto the<br>
drum wall or onto each other. Many such apparatus are commonly available, e.g., the<br>
Roche type friabilator (Van Kel Industries, Inc., Edison, N.J.); a Erweka Friability<br>
Apparatus (Erweka Instruments, Milford, Conn.) (Bi (1996) supra, Chowhan (1982) J. of<br>
Pharm. Sci. 71:1371-1375), and the like.<br>
[flll64f In one exemplary protocol, the standard United States Pharmacopia (USP)<br>
protocol for measuring friability is used. Briefly, the tablets are placed in a friabilator that is<br>
a 285 mm drum, about 39 mm in depth, of transparent synthetic polymer. The tablets are<br>
"tumbled" at each turn of the drum by a curved projection that extends from the middle of<br>
the drum. The drum is rotated for about four minutes at about 25 rpm, resulting in a total of<br>
100 rotations. A minimum of about 20 tablets are used in any test, unless the tablets weigh<br>
over 650 mg, in which case only 10 tablets are used. After the allotted time, the tablets are<br>
removed from the friabilator, and, with the aid of air pressure or a brush, adhering particles<br>
and dust are removed, and remaining tablets are accurately weighed. Percent loss of weight<br>
is calculated.<br>
^0065] Tablet dissolution is measured by the amount of time for 75% of the tablet<br>
to dissolve in an aqueous solution buffered to pH 7.4 and maintained at 37 ยฐC +0.5ยฐC and<br>
paddle mixed at an rpm of 75.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of Final Blend<br>
[M69f A 125 g batch of Compound 1 granules were prepared by mixing<br>
Compound 1 with all the excipients except magnesium stearate (listed in Table 1) on a<br>
paper tray using a spatula, granulated with approximately 130 g of water. Granules were<br>
dried in the fluid bed at 60 ยฐC and collected at 7.3% and 6.5% LOD. They were then<br>
milled, and blended with 2% magnesium stearate for 2 minutes to make the final blend.<br>
The formulation is shown in Table 1. The final blend was characterized and pressed into<br>
tablets. The tablets were tested for potency and impurities, hardness and dissolution.<br>
Example 2 shows a final blend composition (Table 2) using a KG-5 High Shear Granulator.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of final Blend using a KG-5 High Shear Granulator<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Compound 1 Powder Blend<br>
JflftTO) Three 500 g batches of Compound 1 powder blends (see Table 3) were<br>
prepared according to the following method. A KG-5 High Shear Granulator with an 8-<br>
inch impeller diameter was used to preblend all ingredients (except magnesium stearate) at<br>
low (155 rpm), medium (405 rpm), or high (600 rpm) impeller speeds with the chopper<br>
speed of 1200 rpm for 2 minutes. Water was added at a rate of 30 to 31.5 g/min to the<br>
powder mix. After the full amount of water was added, the mixture was blended for an<br>
additional 2 minutes. The wet granules were dried with the MiniGlatt Fluid Bed Dryer at 60<br>
ยฐC to targeted LODs and the granule texture, size, shape, stickiness, etc visually inspected.<br>
Drying at various temperatures and times are evaluated also. The granules were milled<br>
through CoMill U3 with 0 32R mesh screen (0.0331 inch diameter holes), 1.5% magnesium<br>
stearate was added and mixed for 2 minutes in the V-blender to make the final blends. The<br>
final blends were checked for degradation by HPLC, and physical properties determined<br>
such as, Bulk Density, Tapped Density, Carr's Index, Hausner Ratio and Flow Index by<br>
Flodex. The final blends were compressed into 500 mg tablets using Stokes B-2 Rotary<br>
Press with 0.3071X0.6102 inches modified oval punches. The tablets were compressed<br>
with the same pressure settings to obtain maximum/achievable tablet hardness.<br>
-fOOTF] Carr's Index is a measure of compressibility of powder and defined as<br>
percent of (Tapped Density - Bulk Density)/Tapped Density. The higher the index, the<br>
more compressible of the powder and the poorer the flow. An index is 5 to 15% indicates<br>
excellent to good flowability. The Hausner Ratio is the ratio of Tapped Density to Bulk<br>
Density and is an assessment of interparticulate friction. A ratio of 
acceptable friction, in other words good powder flow. The maximum achievable hardness<br>
is defined as the hardness achieved with the maximum compression force.<br>
Example 4<br>
Physical Properties of Final Blend<br>
<j compound the hexahydrate was granulated with excipients></j>
(except magnesium stearate) in Table 4. The physical properties of the final blend made by<br>
granulating Compound 1 with all the excipients together and drying to 6.5% LOD were<br>
measured and are shown in Table 5.<br>
[0073] The Carr's Index of 15% and a flow index of 16 mm indicate an excellent<br>
powder flow of the final blend.<br>
Example 5<br>
Maximum Achievable Hardness of Tablets<br>
[0074] Tablets from final blends prepared as described in Example 4 with 7.27%<br>
and 6.47% LOD and were compressed and the hardness determined. The results are<br>
provided in Table 6. The tablet hardness was the maximum that was achievable. As<br>
demonstrated, tablets with hardness of 27.9 to 33.8 kp were obtained. All the tablets from<br>
these final blends appeared off-white and highly homogeneous. The final blend with 6.47%<br>
was compressed to tablets with hardness of 20 kp and 30 kp. The tablets displayed &gt;75%<br>
dissolution after 30 minutes, indicating a large tolerance with respect to the hardness of<br>
tablets.<br>
Table 6<br>
Example 6<br>
Stability of Compound 1 in Tablets<br>
[W75f Tablets from Example 5 were stored under intensified shelf-life conditions<br>
(one month at 40 ยฐC and 75% Relative Humidity) and analyzed for purity and potency by<br>
HPLC. Analysis results for tablets after one month at the aforementioned showed a purity<br>
of98.8-99.1%.<br>
Example 7<br>
Dependence of Tablet Hardness on Density of Blend<br>
[M76}- Select batches of granules which were produced by methods described in<br>
Example 3, were further subjected to the various granulation parameters shown in Table 7.<br>
The impeller speed was varied and it was observed that low impeller speeds lead to less<br>
dense granules. In addition, the amount of water sprayed during the process was evaluated<br>
and it was found that less water sprayed may also help to lower the density of granules.<br>
* Batch C is a combination of three independent batches. Experimental procedures for<br>
Batch A, B, C are the same except the Impeller speed, chopper speed, rate and<br>
amount of water added.<br>
J0j&amp;27} All the granules possess excellent flow properties as measured by Hauser<br>
ratio, Carr's index and flow index. The LOD of dry granules, 6.0 to 6.6%, is close to 7.1%<br>
as in the starting blend. These blends appeared ideal for tablet compression.<br>
[(}Q7ff] Tablets were compressed from these blends after blending with magnesium<br>
stearate at the maximum compression force. Results are summarized in Table 8. The less<br>
dense the blend, the harder the tablets. The blend with density of 0.65 g/mL resulted in<br>
tablets with the maximum hardness of 5-8 kp.<br>
Example 8<br>
Moisture content (LOD) vs. hardness of tablets with density of the blend 
Mff9] The granules from Batch A (Example 7) were dried at 50 ยฐC, 60 ยฐC and 70<br>
ยฐC to LOD of 6.4 to 6.8 %. The dried granules were assayed by HPLC. The<br>
purity/impurity profiles remained the same for the three drying conditions. Compared to<br>
API, there was 0.15% decrease in purity and the same amount of increase in Compound 2.<br>
The tablets compressed from Batch A were dried and analyzed via HPLC and gave similar<br>
results to the granules. The dissolution of the tablets was &gt;75% after 30 min.<br>
Example 9<br>
Moisture content (LOD) vs. Hardness<br>
[0080] Batch C (Example 7) was further dried in 6x65 g lots (Labeled C-l to C-6)<br>
to LOD of 4.7, 5.6, 6.7, 7.6, 8.7 and 9.3%. All the dried granules were milled through<br>
CoMil with #25 mesh screen, and mixed with 1.5%) magnesium stearate for 2 minutes. The<br>
physical properties of the final blends are summarized in Table 9.<br>
fQQ8-rf" The final blends C-l - C-6 from Table 9 were compressed separately into<br>
500 mg tablets under the same maximum compression force. LOD of the final blends,<br>
weight, hardness and thickness of the tablets are provided in Table 10.<br>
