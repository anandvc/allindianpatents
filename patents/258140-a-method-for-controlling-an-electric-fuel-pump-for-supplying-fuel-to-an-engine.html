The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description made with reference to the accompanying drawings.   In the drawings:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing an engine control system;<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a procedure for setting target rotation speed of a fuel pump in the engine control system, according to a first embodiment;<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing a procedure for setting target rotation speed of the fuel pump, according to a second embodiment; and<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing a procedure for setting target rotation speed of the fuel pump, according to a third embodiment.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br><br>
For example, an engine control system is provided to control an internal combustion engine such as a gasoline engine for a two-wheel vehicle. In this control system, an electronic control unit (ECU) serves as a central unit to control a fuel injection amount and ignition timing. First, an engine control system is described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, an air cleaner 12 is provided to an uppermost portion of an intake pipe 11 of an engine 10, and a throttle valve 14 is provided downstream of the air cleaner 12. The air cleaner 12 is provided with an intake temperature sensor 13 for detecting temperature of intake air. The throttle valve 14 is provided with a throttle opening sensor 15 for detecting a throttle position. An intake pressure sensor 16 is provided downstream of the throttle valve 14 for detecting intake pressure. Furthermore, an electromagnetic injector 17 is provided in the vicinity of an intake port of the intake pipe 11.<br>
An intake valve 21 and an exhaust valve 22 are provided respectively to the intake port and an exhaust port of the engine 10. The intake valve 21 opens, so that mixture gas containing air and fuel is drawn into a combustion chamber 23. The exhaust valve 22 opens, so that burned exhaust gas is exhausted into an exhaust pipe 24. An ignition plug 25 is provided to a cylinder head of the engine 10 correspondingly to each cylinder. The ignition plug 25 is applied with high voltage via an ignition device 26, which is constructed of an ignition coil and the like, at desirable ignition timing. Each ignition plug 25 includes opposed electrodes for discharging a spark by being applied with the high voltage, so that mixture gas drawn into the combustion chamber 23 is ignited and burned.<br>
The exhaust pipe 24 is provided with a catalyst 31 such as a three-way catalyst for purifying CO, HC, Nox, and the line in exhaust gas. An A/F sensor 32 is provided upstream the catalyst 31 for detecting an air/fuel ratio of<br><br>
mixture gas by sensing exhaust gas as a detected object. The engine 10 is provided with a cooling water sensor 33 for detecting cooling water temperature and a crank angle sensor 34 for outputting rectangular-shaped crank angle signals at predetermined intervals such as 30 °CA with operation of the engine 10.<br>
In a fuel system, a fuel tank 41 accommodates an in-tank fuel pump module 42. The fuel pump module 42 is connected with a delivery pipe 45 through a fuel pipe 43. The fuel pump module 42 is constructed of a pump portion 46, a motor 47, and a pressure regulator 44. The fuel pump module 42 is constructed of a fuel filter, a return pipe, and the like, none shown in FIG. 1. The motor 47 is provided for driving and rotating the pump portion 46. The motor 47 and the pump portion 46 rotate at the same rotation speed. The pump portion 46 is capable of discharging fuel corresponding to the rotation speed thereof. In this embodiment, the motor 47 is constructed of a generally known sensor-less brushless motor capable of controlling rotation speed without a rotation position sensor.<br>
The pressure regulator 44 is provided for controlling pressure of fuel discharged from the fuel pump module 42. When pressure of fuel discharged from the pump portion 46 of the fuel pump module 42 becomes greater than set pressure of the pressure regulator 44, excessive fuel is returned into the fuel tank 41 through a return pipe. That is, the fuel pump module 42 discharges fuel, which is controlled at predetermined pressure in the pressure regulator 44, so that the fuel is supplied to the delivery pipe 45 through the fuel pipe 43. Furthermore, excessive fuel is retuned into the fuel tank 41 through the return pipe.<br>
An ECU 50 is constructed of a microcomputer, which includes a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, and the like, as a main unit.   The ECU 50 inputs detection<br><br>
signals of the various sensors and a detection signal of supply voltage VP applied to the motor 47. The ECU 50 executes various control programs stored in the ROM to control the fuel injection timing of the injector 17 and the ignition timing of the ignition plug 25 in accordance with the operating condition of the engine 10,<br>
The ECU 50 outputs a pulse-width modulation signal to the motor 47 to control rotation speed of the motor 47. A rotor magnet of the motor 47 rotates, so that a stator coil generates induced voltage. The ECU 50 alters the intervals of the pulse-width modulation signals correspondingly to this induced voltage, thereby controlling the motor 47 at predetermined target rotation speed. Thus, the rotation speed of the motor 47 is controlled by the pulse-width modulation signals output from the ECU 50. The rotation speed of the motor 47 is same as the rotation speed (pump rotation speed NP) of the pump portion 46. Actual pump rotation speed NP can be obtained in accordance with the pulse-width modulation signal serving as a driving signal of the motor 47 output from the ECU 50. In this structure, a rotative position sensor for detecting actual pump rotation speed NP need not be provided.<br>
Next, a procedure for setting the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is described with reference to FIG. 2. The ECU 50 executes the routine shown in FIG. 2 at predetermined intervals after engine start.<br>
In FIG. 2, step SI 01 reads information of each sensor. Specifically, step SI01 reads the throttle position, the intake pressure, the engine rotation speed NE, and the like from the detection signals of various sensors. Step SI02 calculates a required discharge amount FAD of fuel needed correspondingly to the operating condition of the engine 10, in accordance with the engine rotation speed NE and a load, which corresponds to the throttle position or the intake pressure.   A map defining a relationship between the<br><br>
required discharge amount FAD and the engine rotation speed NE is prestored in the ECU 50. Step S102 calculates the required discharge amount FAD using the map.<br>
Step S103 calculates rotation speed (required pump rotation speed NPD) of the pump portion 46 correspondingly to the required discharge amount FAD calculated in step S102. A map defining a relationship between the discharge amount of the fuel pump module 42 and the engine rotation speed NE is prestored in the ECU 50. Step S103 calculates the required pump rotation speed NPD correspondingly to a required fuel amount using the map.<br>
Step S104 calculates a frequency component (engine-sound reference frequency FNE) in accordance with the engine rotation speed NE. The engine-sound reference frequency FNE is the smallest frequency component of frequency components contained in engine sound made together with the engine rotation. Generally, sound made from an engine and a pump includes multiple frequency components. Frequency of each component is an integer multiple of the smallest frequency (reference frequency) of frequency components contained in the sound. That is frequency of each component equals to multiplication of integers by the smallest frequency (reference frequency) of frequency components contained in the sound. Step SI 05 calculates reference frequency (required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD) of pump operation sound made when the pump portion 46 is driven at the required pump rotation speed NPD.<br>
A map defining a relationship between the engine rotation speed NE and the engine-sound reference frequency FNE is prestored in the ECU 50. A map defining a relationship between the pump rotation speed and the reference frequency of the pump operation sound is also prestored in the ECU 50. Step S104  and  step  S105  respectively  calculate  the  engine-sound   reference<br><br>
frequency FNE and the required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD, using the maps.<br>
Step S106 calculates frequency (synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS). The synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS is frequency, which is equal to or greater than the required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD and is the closest to the required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD, of multiples of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE.<br>
Step S107 calculates pump rotation speed (synchronous pump rotation speed NPS) making pump operation sound containing a frequency component, which is a multiple of the synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS. Step S107 calculates the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS using the map defining the relationship between the pump rotation speed and the reference frequency of the pump operation sound.<br>
The synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS is a multiple of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE. A frequency component of pump operation sound made when the pump portion 46 is driven at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is a multiple of the synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS. Therefore, each frequency component of pump operation sound made when the pump portion 46 is driven at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is a multiple of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE. That is, each frequency component of the pump operation sound is synchronized with the frequency component of the engine operation sound.<br>
Step S108 evaluates whether the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is equal to or less than maximum pump rotation speed NPMAX, by which the pump portion 46 is capable of producing in performance. This step is for evaluating whether the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS calculated in step S107 is rotation speed, which the pump portion 46 is capable of producing.<br><br>
When step S108 makes a positive det ,rmination, step S109 sets target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS, subsequently, the routine is terminated. When step S108 makes a negative determination, step S110 sets the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 at the required pump rotation speed NPD, subsequently, the routine is terminated.<br>
As described above, this embodiment produces the following effects.<br>
In this embodiment, when the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is equal to or less than the maximum pump rotation speed NPMAX, the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS. The frequency component contained in pump operation sound is a multiple of the synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS, by controlling the pump rotation speed NP at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS. The synchronous pump sound frequency FNPS is a multiple of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE. Therefore, each frequency component of pump operation sound made when the pump portion 46 is driven at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is a multiple of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE. That is, all frequency components contained in the pump operation sound can be synchronized with the frequency components contained in the engine operation sound. In this operation, pump operation sound can be synchronized with engine sound, so that pump operation sound can be concealed with engine sound. Consequently, pump operation sound can be restricted from being noticeable relative to engine sound. In addition, the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set to be equal to or greater than the required pump rotation speed NPD.<br>
In this operation, the engine 10 is supplied with fuel of the required discharge amount FAD in accordance with the operating condition of the engine<br><br>
10,  so that the operating condition of the engine  10 can be preferably maintained.<br>
The synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is set at a value, which is equal to or greater than the required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD and is the closest to the required-pump-sound reference frequency FNPD, of multiples of the engine-sound reference frequency FNE. In this operation, pump operation sound can be made substantially unnoticeable relative to the engine sound, in addition to reducing the pump rotation speed NP and satisfying the required discharge amount FAD. The pump rotation speed NP is reduced, so that electric power for driving the pump can be reduced. Thus, power reduction can be achieved.<br>
When the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS is greater than the maximum pump rotation speed NPMAX, the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set at the required pump rotation speed NPD. In this operation, pump operation sound may be noticeable, because of not controlling rotation speed at the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS in consideration of performance of the pump portion 46. Even though, the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set at the required pump rotation speed NPD, which is the minimum rotation speed for satisfying the required discharge amount FAD, so that pump sound can be reduced it self, and power reduction can be achieved.<br>
In this embodiment, the motor 47 for driving and rotating the pump portion 46 is constructed of a sensor-less brushless motor capable of controlling rotation speed without a rotation position sensor. In this structure, the structure of the motor 47 can be simplified, so that the structure of the fuel pump module 42 can be also simplified. (Second Embodiment)<br><br>
In FIG. 3, the procedure from step S201 to step S203 is substantially similar to the procedure from step S101 to step S103 in FIG. 2 in the first embodiment.<br>
Step S204 evaluates whether the engine rotation speed NE is equal to or greater than predetermined rotation speed a. Step S204 is for evaluating whether the engine 10 is in a predetermined high-rotation speed condition. The predetermined high-rotation speed condition indicates a condition where the engine rotation speed is equal to or greater than predetermined rotation speed such as 4000 rpm, and engine sound made with rotation of the engine 10 becomes sufficiently large relative to pump operation sound. When step S204 makes a positive determination, step S211 sets the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 at the required pump rotation speed NPD. Subsequently, the routine is terminated. By contrast, when step S204 makes a negative determination, the routine proceeds to step S205. The procedure from step S205 to step S211 is substantially similar to the procedure from step S104 to step S110 in FIG. 2 in the first embodiment.<br>
When the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition, operation sound of the engine 10 becomes sufficiently large compared with pump operation sound made from the pump portion 46. Therefore, influence caused by operation sound of the pump portion 46 is small, even when special countermeasure for synchronizing or concealing pump operation sound with engine sound is not implemented. Thus, in this embodiment, when the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition, the target rotation speed is set at the required pump rotation speed NPD, without calculating the synchronous pump rotation speed NFS. In this operation, when the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition, the synchronous pump rotation speed NFS need not be calculated.<br><br>
Thus, the processing can be simplified. (Third Embodiment)<br>
In FIG. 4, step S301 reads information of each sensor. Specifically, step S301 reads the throttle position, the intake pressure, the engine rotation speed NE, and the like from the detection signals of various sensors.<br>
Step 8302 evaluates whether the engine rotation speed NE is equal to or greater than a predetermined rotation speed range p. Step S302 is for evaluating whether the engine 10 is in a predetermined high-rotation speed condition. The predetermined high-rotation speed condition indicates a condition where the engine rotation speed is equal to or greater than predetermined rotation speed such as 4000 rpm. The predetermined high-rotation speed condition indicates a condition where engine sound made with rotation of the engine 10 becomes sufficiently large relative to pump operation sound, and electricity generated using an in-vehicle generator becomes sufficiently large. When step S302 makes a positive determination, step S303 sets the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 at the maximum pump rotation speed NPMAX, by which the pump portion 46 is capable of producing in performance. Subsequently, the routine is terminated. By contrast, when step S302 makes a negative determination, the routine proceeds to step S304. The procedure from step S304 to step S312 is substantially similar to the procedure from step 3102 to step S110 in FIG. 2 in the first embodiment. The threshold p in step S302 may be the same value as the threshold a in step S204 in the second embodiment. Alternatively, threshold p in step S302 may be a different value from the threshold a in step S204 in the second embodiment.<br>
When the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition,  operation  sound  of the  engine   10  becomes  sufficiently  large<br><br>
compared with pump operation sound made when the pump portion 46 is driven. Therefore, influence caused by operation sound of the pump portion 46 is small, even when special countermeasure for synchronizing or concealing pump operation sound with engine sound is not implemented. In addition, when the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition, necessity to limit the pump rotation speed NP to the required pump rotation speed NPD for power reduction is small. That is, the in-vehicle generator sufficiently secures electric power generation when the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition. Therefore, even when the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set high, power consumption of the pump portion 46 may not cause deficiency in battery capacity.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, when the engine 10 is in the predetermined high-rotation speed condition, the target rotation speed of the pump portion 46 is set at the maximum pump rotation speed NPMAX, without calculating the required pump rotation speed NPD and the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS. Thus, the required pump rotation speed NPD and the synchronous pump rotation speed NPS need not be calculated, so that the processing can be simplified. (Other Embodiment)<br>
The second embodiment may be combined with the third embodiment. Specifically, the thresholds a, p of the engine rotation speed Ne in the second embodiment and the third embodiment are set to satisfy the relationship of a 
 <br>
engine rotation speed NE is equal to or greater than a predetermined high-rotation speed range, rotation speed of the pump portion 46 can be controlled further variably in accordance with the engine rotation speed NE. Consequently, rotation speed of the pump portion 46 can be controlled further adaptively to the operating condition.<br>
In the above embodiments, the motor 47 for driving the pump portion 46 is constructed of a brushiess motor. Alternatively, the motor 47 may be constructed of a motor having a brush.<br>
In the above embodiments, the control system is applied to the engine for a two-wheel vehicle. However, the control system is not limited to being applied to a two-wheel vehicle. The control system may be applied to another vehicle, in particular, a small vehicle such as an agricultural vehicle, other than a two-wheel vehicle, for example. In this case, even in a vehicle having a simple system, rotation of the pump portion 46 of the fuel pump module 42 can be properly controlled, possibly without additional components. The control system is not limited to being applied to a small vehicle.<br>
The above processings such as calculations and determinations are not limited being executed by the ECU 50. The control unit may have various structures including the ECU 50 shown as an example.<br>
