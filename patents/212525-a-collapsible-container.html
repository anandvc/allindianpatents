This invention relates to a collapsible container.<br>
The container proposed herein replaces wooden boxes and crates which are now being extensively used, depleting natural resources by deforestation.<br>
The container proposed herein has structural strength required in loading and handling, the design being such that whenever the container is not in use, it can easily be rendered collapsible and stowed away, in stacks thus saving space.<br>
In the case of smaller sizes of the container proposed herein, handles are provided for lifting and transportation ; while in bigger sizes, hooks and eye bolts are provided.<br>
The container proposed herein can be made of any material suitable to the application and requirement e.g. metal and plastics.<br><br>
Various other features of the container proposed herein will be apparent from the following description.<br>
The collapsible container, according to this invention, comprises two front and rear panels with their ends dovetailing with the ends of two side panels, the dovetailing ends being fixed together by locking pins passing through matching holes in the dovetailing segments; a base panel for being slidably located in grooves cut at the base of the side panels and fixed in position by the said locking pins passing through matching holes in the said base panel; two top panels for being placed on top of the front, rear and side panels, said top panels having overhanging ridged ends abutting each other; a locking plate slidable on , engageably with, the abutting ridged ends, said locking plate having end flaps for being locked to the side panels.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, one   of   the    various      possible       embodiments    of     the<br><br>
container proposed herein.<br>
Fig 1, illustrating the container in a collapsed state.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating the container assembled<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating the locking plate engaging with the ridged ends of<br>
the top panel<br>
Fig, 4 illustrating the projections on the top panel and the mating<br>
slots on the front panel (a similar provision existing for the other top<br>
panel and rear panel)<br>
Fig. 5 illustrating a separate view of a side panel<br>
Fig. 6 illustrating a separate view of the front panel<br>
Fig. 7 illustrating a top panel from top<br>
Fig. 8 illustrating a top panel from bottom<br>
Fig. 9 illustrating a separate view of the base panel<br>
Fig. 10   illustrating a separate view of the metal flap and Fig. 11<br>
illustrating a schematic view of the assembly.<br>
The container has two front and rear panels PF and PR with their<br>
ends dovetailing with the ends of two side panels PSl and<br>
PS2,        the        dovetailing       ends	being	fixed<br><br>
together by locking pins L passing through matching holes H in the dovetailing segments D. A base panel PB is slidably located in the grooves G cut at the base of the side panels PS1 and PS2 The base panel is fixed in position by the said locking pins passing through matching holes J in the said base panel.<br>
Two top panels PT1 and PT 2 are provided for being placed on top<br>
of the front, rear and side panels, said top panels having	ridged<br>
ends Rl R2 abutting each other , These ridged ends have an overhang 01 02 to enable a locking plate M to slidably move on and engage with said ridged ends, said locking plate having hinged end flaps W for being locked to the side panels.<br>
The top panels PTl PT2 have a plurality of end projections T receivable in mating slots V in the front and rear panels. This arrangement enables the top panels to be secured in position.<br>
The side panels have dovetailing slideways Y engageable with    the    base of   the   said    panels   to serve  as supports<br><br>
therefor.  A pallet Q is provided to deal with heavy loads.<br>
Any one or more of the said panels are provided with handles or eyebolts and hooks for handling and transportation.<br>
It will be observed that the assembled container can be readily disassembled and rendered collapsible for being stacked away (Fig. 1). When stacked, the front and rear panels , base panels, top panels will be disposed in between the side panels and the stack closed by the locking plate M (Fig. 1).<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described , but it is understood that various other embodiments of the collapsible container proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
\. A collapsible container comprising two front and rear panels with their ends dovetailing with the ends of two side panels, the dovetailing ends being fixed together by locking pins passing through matching holes in the dovetailing segments; a base panel for being slidably located in grooves cut at the base of the side panels and fixed in position by the said locking pins passing through matching holes in the said base panel ; two top panels for being placed on top of the front, rear and side panels, said top panels having overhanging ridged ends abutting each other; a locking plate slidable on , engageably with, the abutting ridged ends, said locking plate having end flaps for being locked to the side panels.<br>
2.	A container as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the top panels have a plurality of end projections receivable in mating slots in the front and rear panels.<br>
3.	A container as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the side panels have dovetailing       slideways	engageable	with	the<br><br>
base of the said panels to serve as supports therefor<br>
4.	A container as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein any one or more of the said panels are provided with handles or eye bolts and hooks.<br>
5.	A collapsible container substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
