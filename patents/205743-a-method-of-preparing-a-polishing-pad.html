A METHOD OF PREPARING A POLISHING PAD<br>
PPG  INDUSTRIES OHIO,  INC.  of  3800  WEST  143RD  STREET CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A., AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in whicli it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br>
1 6 AUG 2005<br><br>
ORIGINAL 16-8-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a polishing pad. In particular, the polishing pad of the present invention can be porous and, can comprise particulate polymer and an organic polymer binder. The polishing pad according to the present invention is useful for polishing articles, and is especially useful for chemical mechanical polishing or planarization of microelectronic and optical electronic devices such as but not limited to semiconductor wafers.<br>
The polishing or planarization of a rough surface of an article such as a microelectronic device, to a substantially smooth surface generally involves rubbing the rough surface with the work surface of a polishing pad using a controlled and repetitive motion. A polishing fluid can be interposed between the rough surface of the article that is to be polished and the work surface of the polishing pad.<br>
The fabrication of a microelectronic device can comprise the formation of a plurality of integrated circuits on a semiconductor substrate. The composition of the substrate can include silicon or gallium arsenide. The integrated circuits generally can be formed by a series of process steps in which patterned layers of materials, such as conductive, insulating and semiconducting materials, are formed on the substrate. In order to maximize the density of integrated circuits per wafer, it is desirable to have a planar polished substrate at various stages throughout the production process. As such, production of a microelectronic device typically involves at least one polishing step and can often involve a plurality of polishing steps, which can result in the use of more than one polishing pad.<br>
The polishing step can include rotating the polishing pad and the semiconductor substrate against each other in the presence of a polishing fluid. The polishing fluid can be mildly alkaline and can optionally contain an abrasive particulate material such as but not limited to particulate cerium oxide, particulate alumina, or particulate silica. The polishing fluid can facilitate the removal and transport of abraded material off and away from the rough surface of the article.<br><br>
Polishing pad characteristics such as pore volume and pore size can vary from pad-to-pad and throughout the operating lifetime of a particular pad. Variations in the polishing characteristics of the pads can result in inadequately polished and planarized substrates which can be unsuitable for fabricating semiconductor wafers. Thus, it is desirable to develop a polishing pad that exhibits reduced pad-to-pad variation in polishing and planarization characteristics. It is further desirable to develop a polishing pad that exhibits reduced variations in polishing and planarization characteristics throughout the operating lifetime of the pad.<br>
A method of preparing a polishing pad which comprises (a) particulate polymer having an average particle size of from 20 microns to 500 microns chosen from thermoplastic particulate polymer, cross linked particulate polymer, particulate polymer comprised of interpenetrating polymer networks, and mixtures thereof,; and (b) an organic polymer binders chosen from thermoplastic organic polymer binders, crosslinked organic polymer binders, organic polymer binders comprised of interpenetrating polymer networks, and mixtures thereof wherein said organic polymer binder is prepared in-situ and said particulate polymer and said organic polymer binder are distributed substantially uniformly across working surface of said pad, and said pad has a percent pore volume of from 2 percent by volume to 50 percent by volume, based on the total volume of said polishing pad comprising the step of reacting an organic polymer binder precursor in the essentially immediate presence of said particulate polymer.<br>
The method of precursor is selected from the group consisting of monomers, prepolymers, resins and mixtures thereof.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a polishing pad comprising: (a) particulate polymer chosen from thermoplastic particulate polymers, crosslinked particulate polymers, particulate polymers comprised of interpenetrating polymer networks, and mixtures thereof; and (b) an organic polymer binder chosen from thermoplastic organic polymer binders, substantially crosslinked organic polymer binders, interpenetrating polymer networks, and mixtures thereof.<br><br><br>
The present invention further includes a polishing pad comprising particulate polymer and an organic polymer binder wherein said binder is formed in-situ. Moreover, the present invention includes a polishing pad comprising particulate polymer and an organic polymer binder wherein there is no sintering of particles in said particulate polymer.<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the term "substantially uniformly across working surface of said pad" refers to the distribution of the particulate polymer and organic polymer binder such that the variation in physical characteristics of the pad is reduced, and the uniformity of the physical characteristics of the pad is enhanced.<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the terms "in-situ preparation of the binder", in-situ polymerization of the binder" "in-situ formation of the binder", and similar terminology, refer to preparing, polymerizing and/or forming the organic polymer binder of the present invention in the presence of the particulate polymer. In a non-limiting embodiment, the molecules of a binder precursor can chemically react with each other to form the organic polymer binder while the precursor is in the presence of the particulate polymer. In another non-limiting embodiment, more than one binder precursor can be used and the molecules of one precursor can chemically react with the molecules of another precursor to form the organic polymer binder while in the presence of the particulate polymer.<br>
Suitable organic binder precursors for use in the present invention can be selected from a wide variety known to skilled artisans. Non-limiting examples can include monomers, prepolymers, resins and mixtures thereof. In a non-limiting embodiment, the organic binder precursor can comprise catalysts, crosslinking agents, curing agents, and other conventional additives that are known in the art.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the percent pore volume of the polishing pad of the present invention can be calculated using the following equation, "100x(density of the pad)(pore volume of the pad)". The density (e.g., grams per cubic centimeter) can be determined in accordance with American Standard Test Method (ASTM) No. D 1622-88.<br><br><br>
The pore volume (e.g., cubic centimeters per gram) can be determined by means of a mercury porosimetry method in accordance with ASTM D 4284-88, using an Autopore III mercury porosimeter from Micromeritics.<br>
It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional representation of a polishing pad assembly according to the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional representation of a polishing pad assembly according to the present invention, which is similar to that of FIG. 1 but in which the adhesive means is an adhesive assembly; and<br><br>
FIG. 3 is a sectional representation of a polishing pad according the present invention, in which a portion of the pad, including a portion of the work surface of the pad, is shown in greater detail. FIGS. 1-3 are not to scale. In FIGS. 1-3, like numerals refer to the same structural components.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the polishing pad of the present invention can comprise particulate polymer and an organic polymer binder. The organic polymer binder can bind together the particulate polymer.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable particulate polymer can include thermoplastic particulate polymers, crosslinked particulate polymers, and mixtures thereof. In a non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polymer can be chosen such that there is no sintering of the particles upon heating. As used herein and the claims, the term "no sintering" and related terms mean that there is minimal plastic flow at the boundary of the particulate polymer, and little to no coalescence between the particles of the particulate polymer in the polishing pad of the present invention.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, when the particulate polymer of the pad comprises particulate thermoplastic polymer, the polishing pad can be prepared below the melting or sintering point of the particulate thermoplastic polymer. In another non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polymer can comprise particulate crosslinked polymer which can have sintering point, and thus can be unsinterable.<br>
The polymer comprising the particulate polymer for use in the present invention can be prepared by various methods that are known to the skilled artisan. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the polymer can be formed by a condensation reaction, or a free radical initiated reaction, or combinations thereof. In one non-limiting embodiment, the polymer can include a polyurethane formed by condensation polymerization of an isocyanate functional polyurethane prepolymer with a polyamine. In another non-limiting embodiment, the polymer can include a polyurethane-acrylate formed by free radical polymerization of a urethane-diacrylate in the presence of free radical initiator. In a further non-limiting embodiment, the polymer can include an interpenetrating<br><br><br>
polymer network formed by stepwise or simultaneous condensation and free radical polymerization reactions. As used herein and the claims, the term "interpenetrating polymer network" (IPN) refers to a combination of two polymers both in network form, at least one of which is synthesized or crosslinked in the immediate presence of the other. Unlike chemical blends, there are no induced covalent bonds between the two polymers. Thus, in addition to mechanical blending and copolymerization, IPNs represent another mechanism by which different polymers can be physically combined.<br>
The particulate polymer can be prepared by various methods that are known to the skilled artisan. In a non-limiting embodiment, bulk polymers can be cryogenically ground and classified into desired particle size ranges. In another non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polymer can be prepared directly by reacting a two-component composition comprising a polyisocyanate and an OH-containing material, in the presence of a liquid medium. In a further non-limiting embodiment, said liquid medium is heated and agitated. In another non-limiting embodiment, the liquid medium (such as but not limited to an aqueous medium) can be chosen such that the two-component composition can be substantially insoluble in the medium. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the shape of the particulate polymer can be regular or irregular, and can include but is not limited to the following shapes: spherical, disk, flake and combinations or mixtures thereof.<br>
In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the particulate polymer can have an average particle size of at least 20 microns, or at least 50 microns, or at least 100 microns. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the particulate polymer can have an average particle size of less than 500 microns, or less than 400 microns, or less than 300 microns. The average particle size of the particulate polymer can be determined by methods that are well known to the skilled artisan. In a non-limiting embodiments the average particle size of the particulate polymer can be determined using light scattering techniques, such as a Coulter LS particle size analyzer which is manufactured and commercially available from Beckman Coulter Incorporated. As used herein and in the claims, "particle size" refers to the diameter of the particle based on volume percent as determined by light scattering using a Coulter Counter LS particle size analyzer. In this<br><br><br>
light scattering technique, the diameter is determined from a hydrodynamic radius of gyration regardless of the actual shape of the particle. The "average" particle size is the average diameter of the particle based on volume percent.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polymer can be substantially solid. As used herein and in the claims, and with reference to the particulate polymer of the polishing pad, the term "substantially solid" means that the particulate polymer is not hollow, for example, the particulate polymer is not in the form of hollow microcapsules. In a non-limiting embodiment, the substantially solid particulate polymer can contain entrapped gas wherein the entrapped gas bubbles can have an average particle size of less than on-half of the average particle size of the particulate polymer.<br>
Suitable particulate polymers can be chosen from a wide variety of polymers that are well known to the skilled artisan, and can include but are not limited to polyvinylchloride, polyvinylfluoride, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, polycarbonate, polyester, poly(meth)acrylate, polyether, polyamide, polyurethane, polyepoxide, polystyrene, polyimide (e.g., polyetherimide), polysulfone and mixtures thereof. As used herein and in the claims, the term "(meth)acrylate" refers to acrylates which can include urethane acrylates, methacrylates and combinations of acrylates and methacrylates. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, polyurethanes can have backbone linkages chosen from urethane linkages (-NH-C(O)-O-), urea linkages (-NH-C(0)-NH- or -NH-C(0)-N(R)- wherein R can be hydrogen, an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group), thio-carbamate linkages (-NH-C(O)-S-), and combinations thereof. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, polyepoxides can have backbone linkages chosen from ether linkages, thio-ether linkages, ester linkages, amino linkages and combinations thereof. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the particulate polymer can be chosen from poly(meth)acrylate, polyurethane, polyepoxide and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particulate polyurethanes can be prepared by various methods that are known to the skilled artisan. In a non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polyurethane can be prepared from a composition comprising an isocyanate functional material which can<br><br><br>
have at least two isocyanate groups, and/or a capped isocyanate reactant having at least two capped isocyanate groups; and a hydrogen functional material which can have at least two hydrogen groups that are reactive with the isocyanate groups of the isocyanate material.<br>
In a non-limiting embodiment, the isocyanate and hydrogen materials can be mixed together and polymerized or cured to form a bulk polyurethane, which can then be ground (e.g., cryogenically ground), and optionally classified. In another non-limiting embodiment, the particulate polyurethane can be formed by mixing the isocyanate and hydrogen materials together, slowly pouring the mixture into heated deionized water under agitation (optionally in the presence of an organic cosolvent and/or surfactant), isolating the formed particulate material (e.g., by filtration), drying the isolated particulate material, and optionally classifying the dried particulate polyurethane. In a further non-limiting embodiment, the isocyanate and hydrogen materials can be mixed together in the presence of an organic solvent. The organic solvent can be chosen from a wide variety known in the art. In an embodiment, the organic solvent can include alcohols, water-insoluble ethers, branched and straight hydrocarbons, ketones, toluene, xylene and mixtures thereof In a non-limiting embodiment, the organic solvent can be methyl isobutyl ketone.<br>
