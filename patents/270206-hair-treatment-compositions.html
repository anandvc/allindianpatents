WO 2004054525 describes hair treatment compositions for the 15  care and repair of damaged hair, and for improving hair manageability, comprising a disaccharide (in particular trehalose), and a diol (in particular 3-methyl-l,3-butanediol).<br>
20  The present inventors have found that hair treatment<br>
compositions comprising a lactone and a disaccharide show improved efficacy in the treatment of hair.<br>
The present invention provides a hair treatment composition 25  according to claim 1.<br>
The invention also provides the use of the above composition in the treatment of dry, damaged and/or unmanageable hair, especially of damaged hair. 30<br><br>
The composition of the invention comprises at least one lactone. Examples of suitable lactones include:<br>

Aldonic acids are polyhydroxy acids resulting from oxidation of the aldehyde group of an aldose to a carboxylic acid group, and the acid of which can be represented by the following general formula: 10<br>
R(CHOH)„CH(OH)COOH<br>
where R is H or an alkyl group (usually H) and n is an integer from 1 to 6. 15<br>
The aldonic acids form intramolecular lactones by removing one mole of water between the carboxyl group and one hydroxyl group.<br>
20  The following are representative aldonic acid lactones:<br>
2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid lactones (glyceric acid lactone);<br>

2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroxyheptanoic acid lactones (stereoisomers: alloheptonolactone, altroheptonolactone, glucoheptonolactone, mannoheptonolactone, guloheptonolactone, idoheptonolactone, 10  galactoheptonolactone, taloheptonolactone).<br>
(b) Aldaric acid lactones<br>
Aldaric acids are polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acids derived 15  from an aldose by oxidation of both terminal carbon atoms to carboxyl groups, and the acid of which can be represented by the following general formula:<br>
HOOC(CHOH)nCH(OH)COOH 20<br>
where n is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
The aldaric acids form intramolecular lactones by removing one mole of water between one carboxyl group and one 25  hydroxyl group.<br>
The following are representative aldaric acid lactones:<br>
2,3-dihydroxybutane-l, 4-dioic acid lactones 30<br><br>

galactoheptarolactone, taloheptarolactone). 15<br>
(c) Alduronic acids<br>
Alduronic acids are polyhydroxy acids resulting from oxidation of the alcohol group of an aldose to a carboxylic 20  acid group, and can be represented by the following general formula:<br>
HOOC (CHOH) nCH (OH) CHO<br>
25  where n is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
Many alduronic acids form intramolecular lactones by removing one mole of water between the carboxyl group and one hydroxyl group. 30<br>

10  (d) Aldobionic acids<br>
Aldobionic acids are also known as bionic acids, and typically include one monosaccharide chemically linked through an ether bond to an aldonic acid. Aldobionic acids 15  may also be described as an oxidised form of a disaccharide or dimeric carbohydrate, such as lactobionic acid from lactose.<br>
In most aldobionic acids, the carbon at position one of the 20  monosaccharide is chemically linked to a hydroxyl group at a different position of the aldonic acid. Therefore, different aldobionic acids or stereoisomers can be formed from two identical monosaccharides and aldonic acids respectively.<br>
25  As with acids (a) to (c) above, aldobionic acids have multiple hydroxyl groups attached to carbon chains.<br>
Aldobionic acids can be represented by the following general formula: 30<br>
H(CHOH) =(CHOR)(CHOH)nCOOH<br><br>
where m and n are integers independently from 0 to 7 and R is a monosaccharide.<br>
Aldobionic acids can form intramolecular lactones by 5  removing one mole of water between the carboxyl group and one hydroxyl group.<br>
The following are representative aldobionic acid lactones:<br>
10  lactobionolactone; and isolactobionolactone;<br>
maltobionolactone; isomaltobionic acid isomaltobionolactone; cellobionolactone; gentiobionolactone; kojibionolactone; laminaribionolactone; melibionolactone; nigerobionolactone; rutinobionolactone, and sophorobionolactone.<br>

10  Optionally, a shampoo composition of the invention may<br>
contain further ingredients as described below to enhance performance and/or consumer acceptability.<br>
The composition can include co-surfactants, to help impart 15  aesthetic, physical or cleansing properties to the composition.<br>
An example of a co-surfactant is a nonionic surfactant, which can be included in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 8%, 20  preferably from 2 to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
For example, representative nonionic surfactants that can be included in shampoo compositions of the invention include 25  condensation products of aliphatic (Cs -  Cis) primary or<br>

30  Other representative nonionic surfactants include mono- or di-alkyl alkanolamides.  Examples include coco mono- or di-ethanolamide and coco mono-isopropanolamide.<br><br>
Further nonionic surfactants which can be included in shampoo compositions of the invention are the alkyl polyglycosides (APGs).  Typically, the APG is one which comprises an alkyl group connected (optionally via a bridging group) to a block 5  of one or more glycosyl groups.  Preferred APGs are defined by  the following formula:<br>
RO - (G)n<br>
10  wherein R is a branched or straight chain alkyl group which may be saturated or unsaturated and G is a saccharide group.<br>
R may represent a mean alkyl chain length of from about C5 to about C20 •  Preferably R represents a mean alkyl chain length<br>
15  of from about C8 to about C12.  Most preferably the value of R lies between about 9.5 and about 10.5.  G may be selected from C5 or C6 monosaccharide residues, and is preferably a glucoside.  G may be selected from the group comprising glucose, xylose, lactose, fructose, mannose and derivatives<br>
20  thereof.  Preferably G is glucose.<br>
The degree of polymerisation, n, may have a value of from about 1 to about 10 or more.  Preferably, the value of n lies from about 1.1 to about 2.  Most preferably the value of n 25  lies from about 1.3 to about 1.5.<br>
Suitable alkyl polyglycosides for use in the invention are commercially available and include for example those materials identified as: Oramix NS10 ex Seppic; Plantaren 30  1200 and Plantaren 2000 ex Henkel.<br><br>
Other sugar-derived nonionic surfactants which can be included in compositions of the invention include the Cio-C18 N-alkyl (Ci-C5) polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as the C12-C18 N-methyl glucamides, as described for example in 5  WO 92 06154 and US 5 194 639, and the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C1o-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide.<br>
A preferred example of a co-surfactant is an amphoteric or 10  zwitterionic surfactant, which can be included in an amount ranging from 0.5 to about 8%, preferably from 1 to 4% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Examples of amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants include 15  alkyl amine oxides, alkyl betaines, alkyl amidopropyl<br>
betaines, alkyl sulphobetaines (sultaines), alkyl glycinates, alkyl carboxyglycinates, alkyl amphoacetates, alkyl amphopropionates, alkylamphoglycinates, alkyl amidopropyl hydroxysultaines, acyl taurates and acyl glutamates, wherein 20  the alkyl and acyl groups have from 8 to 19 carbon atoms. Typical amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants for use in shampoos of the invention include lauryl amine oxide, cocodimethyl sulphopropyl betaine, lauryl betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium cocoamphoacetate. 25<br>
A particularly preferred amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant is cocamidopropyl betaine.<br>
Mixtures of any of the foregoing amphoteric or zwitterionic 30  surfactants may also be suitable. Preferred mixtures are those of cocamidopropyl betaine with further amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as described above.  A preferred<br><br>
further amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant is sodium cocoamphoacetate.<br>
The total amount of surfactant (including any co-surfactant, 5  and/or any emulsifier) in a shampoo composition of the<br>
invention is generally from 1 to 50%, preferably from 2 to 40%, more preferably from 10 to 25% by total weight surfactant based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
10  Cationic polymers are preferred ingredients in a shampoo composition of the invention for enhancing conditioning performance.<br>
Suitable cationic polymers may be homopolymers which are<br>
15  cationically substituted or may be formed from two or more<br>
types of monomers.  The weight average (Mw) molecular weight of the polymers will generally be between 100 000 and 2 million daltons.  The polymers will have cationic nitrogen containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated<br>
20  amino groups, or a mixture thereof.  If the molecular weight of the polymer is too low, then the conditioning effect is poor.  If too high, then there may be problems of high extensional viscosity leading to stringiness of the composition when it is poured.<br>
25<br>
The cationic nitrogen-containing group will generally be present as a substituent on a fraction of the total monomer units of the cationic polymer.  Thus when the polymer is not a homopolymer it can contain spacer non-cationic monomer<br>
30  units.  Such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic<br>
Ingredient Directory, 3rd edition.  The ratio of the cationic to non-cationic monomer units is selected to give polymers<br><br>
having a cationic charge density in the required range, which is generally from 0.2 to 3.0 meq/gm. The cationic charge density of the polymer is suitably determined via the Kjeldahl method as described in the US Pharmacopoeia under 5  chemical tests for nitrogen determination.<br>
Suitable cationic polymers include, for example, copolymers of vinyl monomers having cationic amine or quaternary ammonium functionalities with water soluble spacer monomers<br>
10  such as (meth)acrylamide, alkyl and dialkyl<br>
(meth)acrylamides, alkyl (meth)acrylate, vinyl caprolactone and vinyl pyrrolidine.  The alkyl and dialkyl substituted monomers preferably have C1-C7 alkyl groups, more preferably Cl-3 alkyl groups.  Other suitable spacers include vinyl<br>
15  esters, vinyl alcohol, maleic anhydride, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol.<br>
The cationic amines can be primary, secondary or tertiary amines, depending upon the particular species and the pH of 20  the composition.  In general secondary and tertiary amines, especially tertiary, are preferred.<br>
Amine substituted vinyl monomers and amines can be polymerised in the amine form and then converted to ammonium 25  by quaternization.<br>
The cationic polymers can comprise mixtures of monomer units derived from amine- and/or quaternary ammonium-substituted monomer and/or compatible spacer monomers. 30<br>
Suitable cationic polymers include, for example:<br><br>
-	cationic diallyl quaternary ammonium-containing<br>
polymers including, for example,<br>
dimethyldiallylammonium chloride homopolymer and copolymers of acrylamide and dimethyldiallylammonium<br>
5        chloride, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as<br>
Polyquaternium 6 and Polyquaternium 7, respectively;<br>
-	mineral acid salts of amino-alkyl esters of homo-and<br>
co-polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acids having<br>
10        from 3 to 5 carbon atoms, (as described in U.S. Patent 4,009,256);<br>
-	cationic polyacrylamides(as described in W095/22311).<br>
15  Other cationic polymers that can be used include cationic polysaccharide polymers, such as cationic cellulose derivatives, cationic starch derivatives, and cationic guar gum derivatives.<br>
20  Cationic polysaccharide polymers suitable for use in compositions of the invention include monomers of the formula:<br>
A-O-(R-N^R1) (R2) (R3)X^],<br>
25<br>
wherein: A is an anhydroglucose residual group, such as a starch or cellulose anhydroglucose residual.  R is an alkylene, oxyalkylene, polyoxyalkylene, or  hydroxyalkylene group, or combination thereof. R1, R2 and R3 independently<br>
30  represent alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, or alkoxyaryl groups, each group containing up to about 18 carbon atoms.  The total number of carbon atoms for each<br><br>
cationic moiety (i.e., the sum of carbon atoms in R1, R2 and R3) is preferably about 20 or less, and X is an anionic counterion.<br>
5  Another type of cationic cellulose includes the polymeric quaternary ammonium salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with lauryl dimethyl ammonium-substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 24.  These materials are available from the Amerchol Corporation, for 10  instance under the tradename Polymer LM-200.<br>
Other suitable cationic polysaccharide polymers include quaternary nitrogen-containing cellulose ethers (e.g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,962,418), and copolymers of 15  etherified cellulose and starch (e.g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,958,581).<br>
A particularly suitable type of cationic polysaccharide polymer that can be used is a cationic guar gum derivative, such as  guar hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (commercially available from Rhodia in their JAGUAR trademark series). Examples of such materials are JAGUAR C13S, JAGUAR C14, JAGUAR C15 and JAGUAR C17.<br>
Mixtures of any of the above cationic polymers may be used.<br>
20<br>
Cationic polymer will generally be present in a shampoo composition of the invention at levels of from 0.01 to 5%, preferably from 0.05 to 1%, more preferably from 0.08 to 0.5% by total weight of cationic polymer based on the total weight<br>
25  of the composition.<br><br>
Preferably an aqueous shampoo composition of the invention further comprises a suspending agent. Suitable suspending agents are selected from polyacrylic acids, cross-linked polymers of acrylic acid, copolymers of acrylic acid with a 5  hydrophobic monomer, copolymers of carboxylic acid-containing monomers and acrylic esters, cross-linked copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylate esters, heteropolysaccharide gums and crystalline long chain acyl derivatives.  The long, chain acyl derivative is desirably<br>
10  selected from ethylene glycol stearate, alkanolamides of<br>
fatty acids having from 16 to 22 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof.  Ethylene glycol distearate and polyethylene glycol 3 distearate are preferred long chain acyl derivatives, since these impart pearlescence to the composition.<br>

Another example of a class of suitable cationic conditioning 30  surfactants for use in the invention, either alone or in admixture with one or more other cationic conditioning surfactants, is a combination of (i) and (ii) below:<br><br>
(i)  an amidoamine corresponding to the general formula (I):<br><br>
in which R1 is a hydrocarbyl chain having 10 or more 5       carbon atoms,<br>
R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrocarbyl chains of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and m is an integer from 1 to about 10; and<br>
10  (ii) an acid.<br>
As used herein, the term hydrocarbyl chain means an alkyl or alkenyl chain.<br>
15  Preferred amidoamine compounds are those corresponding to formula (I) in which<br>
R1 is a hydrocarbyl residue having from about 11 to about 24 carbon atoms, 20  R2 and R3 are each independently hydrocarbyl residues,<br>
preferably alkyl groups, having from 1 to about 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and<br>
m is an integer from 1 to about 4.<br>
25  Preferably, R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl groups.<br>
Preferably, m is 2 or 3, i.e. an ethylene or propylene group.<br><br>
Preferred amidoamines useful herein include stearamido-propyldimethylamine, stearamidopropyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldimethylamine, palmitamidopropyldimethylamine, 5  palmitamidopropyldiethylamine, palmitamidoethyldiethylamine, palmitamidoethyldimethylamine,<br>
behenamidopropyldimethylamine, behenamidopropyldiethylmine, behenamidoethyldiethylamine, behenamidoethyldimethylamine, arachidamidopropyldimethylamine, 10  arachidamidopropyldiethylamine, arachid-<br>
amidoethyldiethylamine, arachidamidoethyldimethylamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred amidoamines useful herein are 15  stearamidopropyldimethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Commercially available amidoamines useful herein include: stearamidopropyldimethylamine with tradenames LEXAMINE S-13<br>
20  available from Inolex (Philadelphia Pennsylvania, USA) and AMIDOAMINE MSP available from Nikko (Tokyo, Japan), stearamidoethyldiethylamine with a tradename AMIDOAMINE S available from Nikko, behenamidopropyldimethylamine with a tradename INCROMINE BB available from Croda (North<br>
25  Humberside, England), and various amidoamines with<br>
tradenames SCHERCODINE series available from Scher (Clifton New Jersey, USA).<br>
Acid (ii) may be any organic or mineral acid which is 30      capable of protonating the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition.  Suitable acids useful herein include hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid,<br><br>
lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the acid is selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, tartaric acid, hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof. 5<br>
The primary role of the acid is to protonate the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition thus forming a tertiary amine salt (TAS) in situ in the hair treatment composition. The TAS in effect is a non-permanent quaternary ammonium or 10  pseudo-quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant.<br>
Suitably, the acid is included in a sufficient amount to protonate all the amidoamine present, i.e. at a level which is at least equimolar to the amount of amidoamine present in 15  the composition.<br>
In conditioners of the invention, the level of cationic conditioning surfactant will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, more preferably 0.05 to 7.5%, most preferably 0.1 to 5% 20  by total weight of cationic conditioning surfactant based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Conditioners of the invention will typically also incorporate a fatty alcohol.  The combined use of fatty alcohols and 25  cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a lamellar phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
30      Representative fatty alcohols comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Fatty alcohols are typically compounds containing straight chain alkyl groups.<br><br>
Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the 5  invention.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol in conditioners of the invention will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 8%, more preferably from 0.2 to 7%, most preferably from 0.3<br>
10  to 6% by weight of the composition.  The weight ratio of<br>
cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 1:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:1.5 to 1:8, optimally from 1:2 to 1:5. If the weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is too high, this can lead to eye irritancy from the<br>
15  composition. If it is too low, it can make the hair feel squeaky for some consumers.<br>
Compositions of the invention may suitably take the form of a hair oil, for pre-wash or post-wash use. Typically, hair oils 20  will predominantly comprise water-insoluble oily<br>
conditioning materials, such as triglycerides, mineral oil and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compositions of the invention may also take the form of a 25  hair lotion, typically for use in between washes. Lotions are aqueous emulsions comprising water-insoluble oily conditioning materials.  Suitable surfactants can also be included in lotions to improve their stability to phase separation. 30<br>
Hair treatment compositions according to the invention, particularly water-based shampoos and hair conditioners, will<br><br>
preferably also contain one or more silicone conditioning agents.<br>
particularly preferred silicone conditioning agents are 5  silicone emulsions such as those formed from silicones such as polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone, polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol, and 10  amino-functional polydimethyl siloxanes which have the CTFA designation amodimethicone.<br>
The emulsion droplets may typically have a Sauter mean droplet diameter (Ds,2) in the composition of the invention 15  ranging from 0.01 to 20 micrometer, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 micrometer.<br>
A suitable method for measuring the Sauter mean droplet diameter (D3,2) is by laser light scattering using an 20  instrument such as a Malvern Mastersizer.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions for use in compositions of the invention are available from suppliers of silicones such as Dow Corning and GE Silicones. The use of such pre-formed<br>
25  silicone emulsions is preferred for ease of processing and control of silicone particle size. Such pre-formed silicone emulsions will typically additionally comprise a suitable ernulsifier such as an anionic or nonionic emulsifier, or mixture thereof, and may be prepared by a chemical<br>
30  emulsification process such as emulsion polymerisation, or by mechanical emulsification using a high shear mixer. Preformed silicone emulsions having a Sauter mean droplet<br><br>
diameter (D3,2) of less than 0.15 micrometers are generally termed microemulsions.<br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed silicone emulsions include 5  emulsions DC2-1766, DC2-1784, DC-1785, DC-1786, DC-1788 and microemulsions DC2-1865 and DC2-1870, all available from Dow Corning.  These are all emulsions/microemulsions of dimethiconol. Also suitable are amodimethicone emulsions such as DC2-8177 and DC939 (from Dow Corning) and SME253 {from GE 10  Silicones).<br>
Also suitable are silicone emulsions in which certain types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular weight have been blended with the silicone emulsion<br>
15  droplets, as described for example in WO03/Q94874. In such materials, the silicone emulsion droplets are preferably formed from polydiorganosiloxanes such as those described above. One preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
20<br>
HO (CH2CH20)X (CH (CH3) CH20) y (CH2CH20) X H<br>
wherein the mean value of x is 4 or more and the mean value of y is 25 or more. 25<br>
Another preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
(HO (CH2CH20) a (CH (CH3) CH20) b) 2-N-CH2-CH2-30  N( (OCH2CH(CH3))b(OCH2CH2)3 OH)2<br><br>
wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is 6 or more.<br>
Mixtures of any of the above described silicone emulsions may 5  also be used.<br>
The above described silicone emulsions will generally be present in a composition of the invention at levels of from 0.05 to 10%, preferably 0.05 to 5%, more preferably from 10  0.5 to 2% by total weight of silicone based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
A composition of the invention may contain other ingredients for enhancing performance and/or consumer acceptability.<br>
15  Such ingredients include fragrance, dyes and pigments, pH adjusting agents, pearlescers or opacifiers, viscosity modifiers, and preservatives or antimicrobials. Each of these ingredients will be present in an amount effective to accomplish its purpose.  Generally these optional<br>
20  ingredients are included individually at a level of up to 5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Hair treatment compositions of the invention are primarily intended for topical application to the hair and/or scalp of 25  a human subject, either in rinse-off or leave-on<br>
compositions, for the treatment of dry, damaged and/or unmanageable hair.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by the following, 30  non-limiting Example, in which all percentages quoted are by weight based on total weight unless otherwise stated.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
