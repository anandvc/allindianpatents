				<td>SECURITY LAMINATES WITH INTERLAHINATED TRANSPARENT EMBOSSED  HOLOGRAM<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to security laminates with interlaminated transparent embossed polymer hologram with an inorganic HRI-material-coating and a method for realizing same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
security laminates are traditionally used to protect documents or packages to ensure that the underlying items are not altered by containing an authentification feature making them difficult to counterfeit. Security laminates are particularly useful on identification cards such as driver's licenses, ID-cards and passports, and on other important documents such as certificates of title, security laminates are also useful as tamper proof seals on medications, video cassettes, and compact discs. Five features are particularly important when producing and using security laminates. First, once applied to an article it is important that the laminate is difficult to remove to ensure that the underlying item is not altered or subjected to tampering. Second, a desirable laminate is difficult if not impossible to duplicate by counterfeiters. Third, if tampering occurs it is important to quickly and accurately recognize an altered or counterfeit laminate. Fourth, it is important that manufacturing costs of the laminates are not prohibitively expensive. Fifth, when used on articles such as identification cards, it is important that the laminate has sufficient durability to withstand harsh treatment.<br>
Holograms have, due to the difficulty in making and reproducing them, become a common authentication feature on items like credit cards, driver's licenses and access cards.  Holograms have also been used as security features on high end products, making it harder to counterfeit these products.<br>
A major advance in display holography occurred in 1968 when A. Benton invented white-light transmission holography. This type of hologram can be viewed in ordinary white light creating a "rainbow-image from the seven colours which make up white light.   Benton's invention made mass production of holograms possible using an embossing technique.  With this technique holographic information is transferred from light sensitive glass plates to nickel embossing shims. The holographic images are "printed" by stamping the interference pattern onto plastic.  The resulting hologram can be<br>
 <br>
duplicated millions of times inexpensively, although master-shim rolls will need to be regularly replaced.  Consequently, embossed holograms are now being used by the publishing, advertising, banking and security industries.  The difficulty in making and reproducing holograms has made them a common authentication feature on security items such as credit cards, driver's licenses and access (identification) cards.  Transparent holograms are often used for security applications such as identification or access cards, where it is desired that information positioned behind the hologram remains visible to the unaided eye.<br>
The most common method of creating a hologram is to create a grating pattern in a surface so that particular structures become visible upon diffraction of light in the grating. US 3,578,845 describes how diffraction gratings are typically generated. Typically, the diffraction patterns are embossed into a thermo-formable substrate such as an embossable polymer film. This process is performed by pressing a heated stamp made from a hard material to engrave the desired grating from the contact surface of the stamp onto the embossable substrate.<br>
Diffraction requires that the medium the grating is made of and the media bordering the grating have a difference in refractive index index. The larger this difference, the brighter the diffraction will appear.  To create the highest diffraction in transparent .holograms, the grating is coated with a thin film of transparent material having a high refractive index (HRI).<br>
While the grating can be embossed into the substrate material with a stamp, a more common, economical method, is the use of continuous embossing systems.  Such embossing system are described for example in US 4,913,858 and 5,164,227.  In these methods the grating structure is engraved into the s'lrface of a roll, wh_ch continuously presses its surface pattern into the web type substrate passing between the embossing roll and a backside roll.  In order to obtain the grating in the substrate's surface, the thermo-formable layer on this surface is heated. This can be achieved either by preheating the substrate to the required temperature, or by heating the embossing roll.<br>
WO 2007/027619A2 discloses a translucent holographic film comprising: an adhesive layer; an embossed layer, the embossed layer including an embossed side defining ridges having peaks pointing toward the adhesive layer.<br>
Transparent holograms are commonly produced by using vacuum evaporation techniques to coat an embossed polymer with a transparent HRI-coating.  Moreover, to prevent tampering the resulting hologram is often embedded by lamination within multiplex<br>
3<br>
 <br>
identity documents.  This requires that not only the support/base of the hologram adhere to a contiguous film or layer within the multiplex system making up the identity document, but also that outermost surface of the HRI-layer also adhere to a contiguous film or layer within the multiplex system making up the security document.<br>
Moreover, adhesion of the outermost surface of the HRI-layer to a contiguous film, layer or card should occur without substantial loss of the brilliance of the hologram to prevent loss of contrast.<br>
Commercially available transparent embossed holograms coated with an inorganic HRI-material do not lend themselves to tamper-proof interlamination in the multiplex system making up a multiplex identity document.<br>
ASPECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide a tamper-proof means of laminating a transparent embossed polymer hologram coated with an inorganic HRI-material within the multiplex system making up an identity document without substantial loss of brilliance.<br>
It is therefore a further aspect of the present invention to provide a multiplex identity document comprising an interlaminated tamper-proof embossed polymer hologram coated with an inorganic HRI-material .<br>
Further aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Commercially available transparent embossed holograms coated with an inorganic HRI-material do not lend themselves to tamper-proof interlamination in the multiplex system making up a multiplex identity document.  Typically such embossed holograms are produced by coating an embossable polymer layer on a support followed by locally embossing the layer and vacuum evaporation of a HRI-layer over the whole surface of the embossable polymer layer.  Using standard adhesives it was found impossible to obtain sufficient adhesion of the outermost surface of the HRI-layer, e.g. a ZnS- or a TiOj-layer, to a polyethylene or PETG foil to avoid integral delamination.  Surprisingly it has been found that treatment of the outermost surface of the inorganic HRI-layer of commercially available transparent embossed holograms coated with an inorganic HRI-material with acid or alkali so conditioned the outermost<br>
 <br>
surface of the inorganic HRI-material that good adhesion could be realized to a polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, PET, PVC or polycarbonate foil using adhesives.  This improvement in adhesion was realized at the expense of brilliance indicating a roughening of the surface, but masking or partial coverage with a protective water-releasable/soluble film enabled this problem to be overcome by obtaining adhesion adjacent to the protected areas.  US 5,445,706 discloses the use of various etchants for group II-VI compounds for mirror etching, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  solution, bromine-methanol solution, and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) hydrogen peroxide (H^O^) solution.  5 to 50 wt% aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions at 80°C to 100°C can be used for etching ZnSe, but it is an anisotropic etchant so that etch pits are generated and loss of brilliance is observed. 0.5 to 5 wt% bromine in methanol solution is an etchant which also generates pits resulting in a loss of brilliance. Furthermore, the etching speed is slow and a volatile component is present rendering the composition of the etchant variable. In the case of 1 to 6:1 by volume NH,OH-H,Oj solutions, ZnSe is effective for etching the (lll)B plane of ZnSe and ineffective for the (lll)A plane.  However, since a robust oxide layer is formed the etching speed decreases with increasing etching time. US 5,445,706 specifically discloses as etchant a solution of potassium permanganate in dilute sulphuric acid. Surprisingly it has been found that the use of mild etchants at room temperature is sufficient to condition the surface of inorganic HRI-layers of zinc sulphide or titanium dioxide for the purposes of improving adhesion without the need for aggressive treatment such as plasma etching with argon or argon/oxygen mixtures.<br>

Aspects of the present invention have also been realized by a laminate obtainable by the above-mentioned method.<br>
Aspects of the present invention have also been realized by a security document comprising the above-mentioned laminate.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the polymer film laminated to the outermost surface of the layer of HRI-material is a polymer foil preferably having a thickness between about 5 ^m and about 120 jjxn,   more preferably between about 10 pm and about 60 lum,   most preferably between' about 10 pm and about 3 0 pm.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the peel strength of the HRI-layer is at least 6 N/cm as measured according to ISO Norm 10373-1-1978.  If the foil breaks during the peel strength test the peel strength is above the measurable range of peel strength values.<br>

In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the lamination of the conditioned outermost layer to the polymer film has a peel strength of at least 6 N/cm as measured according to ISO Norm 10373-1-1978. If the polymer film breaks during the peel strength test the peel strength is above the measurable range of peel strength values.<br>
 <br>
<br>
layer is made from a polymer that has a melting point that is at least about lO'C, but preferably at least about 20"C, lov/er than the associated polymer of the support.<br>
The thickness of the embossable layer is preferably between about 1 jum and about 10 ;jm, more preferably between about 2 pm and about 8 ium, most preferable between about 3 )um and about 1  iim.     A layer that is too thin can result in poor embossed image quality. A layer that is too thick is inefficient.<br>
Suitable polymers for the embossable low crystalline layer include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, cellophane, acetate, nylon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamide, polyamide-imide, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, polyether sulfone, or polyether ether ketone and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the embossable layer includes a low crystalline variation of the polymer of the substrate film selected from the following group of polymers: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, cellophane, acetate, nylon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamide, polyamide-imide, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polymethyl methacrylate, polyether sulfone, or polyether ether ketone. The low crystalline polymer becomes pliable at a lower temperature than the core polymer.<br>
A common process for producing an embossable layer, such as an embossable poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) or polypropylene (PP), onto the support is to apply a thermo-formable embossable coating onto at least one surface of the support.  This process is done off¬line, i.e. after manufacturing the support.  Embossable coatings typically are applied either as a water-based or as a solvent-based solution using coating systems well known in the art such as roll coating, gravure coating, air knife coating and rod coating.<br>
Embossing is performed by pressing a shim with the desired grating embedded in its surface onto the embossable substrate, with the HRI coating and the embossable laye^r facing the embossing shim. For the embossing process the film can either be preheated to allow the embossable layer polymer to be pliable under the embossing shim, or the shim itself is heated and transfers the heat into the embossable layer making it pliable.<br>
Support<br>
Suitable supports are any polymer film.  Preferred support films include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate.<br>
 <br>
cellophane, acetate, nylon, polyamide, polyamide-imide, polymethyl methacrylate, polyether sulfone, and polyether ether ketone films.<br>
The support should be sufficiently thick to be self-supporting, but thin enough to be flexed, folded or creased without cracking. Preferably, the base substrate film has a thickness of between about 7 pm and about 120 fum,   more preferably between about 10 /^fm and about 60 ;jm, most preferably between about 10 ;jm and about 30 ^m.<br>
Inorganic HRI-materials<br>
A transparent inorganic HRI coating is applied on top of the embossable surface or layer. In order to achieve sufficient reflectivity, the difference in refractive index between the embossed material and the HRI coating is preferably at least 0.3, more preferably more than 0.6.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the refractive index of the HRI material is at least 2.0, more preferably at least 2.2.<br>
Suitable transparent high refractive index (HRI)-materials include zinc sulphide (ZnS), antimony(III) sulphide, iron(III) oxide (Fe,03), lead(II) oxide (PbO), zinc selenide (ZnSe), cadmium sulfide (CdS), titanium dioxide (TiOj), lead(II) chloride (PbCl,), cerium(lV) oxide (CeOj), tantalum oxide (TajOr), zinc oxide (ZnO), cadmium oxide (CdO), neodymium oxide (NdjOj) and aluminium oxide (A1,0,). Currently, the use of ZnS as a transparent reflection enhancement layer in transparent holograms is the most widely used technology. Mixtures of materials are used as well. US 5,513,019 discloses mixtures of zinc sulphide (ZnS) and tungsten-oxide (WOj) for holograms.<br>
The transparent inorganic HRI^material can be deposited on the layer or support surface in which the embossing with a holographic shim has or will take place by standard deposition techniques such as evaporation, reactive or non-reactive vacuum vapour deposition, physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), sputtering, electron beam deposition and ion beam assisted deposition.<br>
The thickness of the transparent HRI coating is preferably thick enough to provide good refractive properties (refract light) but not so thick as to inhibit its transparent properties. Preferably, the transparent HRI-material is deposited with a thickness of about 20 to about 250 nm with a thickness of about 5 to about 150 nm being particularly preferred, a thickness of about 5 to about 100 nm being especially preferred and a thickness of 10 nm to 80 nm being most especially preferred.  In the case of embossing<br>
10<br>
 <br>
prior to deposition, the deposited HRI-material follows the profile of the embossing.<br>
In vapour deposition techniques, the coating material is evaporated at low pressure, typically in the 1 x 10'^ Pa region, at elevated temperature. By passing the substrate through the vapour, the evaporated material condenses on the embossed substrate surface creating a thin layer of reflection enhancing material. The thickness of the deposited layer depends on several factors, for example, evaporation rate, vapour pressure and dwell time of the substrate in the vapour cloud.<br>
The deposition technique can result in loss of stoichiometry resulting in reduction of the refractive index difference on which the effect is based, loss of transparency and loss of brilliance.<br>
Zinc Sulphide tends to be a soft porous coating but can be deposited at metallizing speeds (lOO's m/min).  Moreover, the ZnS can be thermally evaporated from a slot source that spans the whole web width.  Furthermore, the ZnS can dissociate and recombine easily and so stoichiometry is generally not an issue.  It is also possible to emboss into the polymer through the ZnS and still obtain a good hologram and ZnS has the advantage that the wear on the holographic shims is less than harder materials such as titanium dioxide. Operators may not be so happy with the material as it can smell when the system is vented because of the residual sulphur.<br>
Titanium dioxide tends to be denser, harder and is usually deposited by slower techniques (1 - 10's m/min).  If a hard wearing, highest quality hologram is required then titanium dioxide will probably be the preferred material.  Part of the problem of depositing titanium dioxide is getting the stoichiometry right. Spattering from a titanium target and reacting the noating with oxygen to produce titanium dioxide is not necessarily easy.  The oxygen cannot be controlled selectively to reach the growing coating and not the sputtering cathode and so the cathode gets poisoned. The sputtering rate of titanium dioxide is 20 times slower than for the metal and so the process tends to avalanche to sputtering slowly from an oxide target.  There are methods of correcting for this runaway process but they all push up the deposition costs. Ideally if the coating is to be deposited by sputtering a dual cathode with an AC power supply including arc control would be preferred.   It is possible to deposit titanium dioxide from electron beam deposition sources but getting a consistent stoichiometry is not trivial. Often an additional oxygen plasma is used both to densify the coating to make it more like a sputtered coating but also as a method of reducing the excess oxygen that is required to convert the metal to titanium dioxide.<br>
11<br>
 <br>
Uniformity of the HRI-coating can also be an issue.  Sputtering has a deposition rate fall off towards the ends of the cathode so that to get high uniformity across the whole web width requires a cathode length wider than the web width.  For electron beam sources it depends on whether you have a series of individual sources that have their deposition flux integrated across the width or whether there is a single sweeping electron beam with a single crucible that spans the web width.<br>
Critical to all vacuum deposition techniques is the position of the pumping system in the system and the method of feeding in the oxygen gas.  Ideally the pumping will be symmetric about the web centreline (including any cryopumps) if this is not the case there are additional problems in achieving uniformity.  Moisture from the webs can be a source of oxygen to the coating as well as the oxygen added to control the process.  If there is asymmetric pumping then there will be a pressure gradient across the web and it then becomes difficult to deliver sufficient oxygen, and no more, to all parts of the sputtering cathode or vapour flux from the e-beam source.  Any imbalance will lead to non-stoichiometric coatings.<br>
Plasma post treatment can be used to clean the outermost HRI-layer surface to remove surface contamination.  The choice of power, time and gas composition can all affect the effectiveness of any plasma treatment.  Argon plasma can roughen the surface and sputter efficiently but there is no mechanism for converting any hydrocarbons into gaseous species that can be pumped away and hence whatever is sputtered from the surface may well fall back and still be a contaminant on the surface even though it has been plasma treated.  Thus plasma treatment with an oxygen/argon mixture is often preferred.  H' wever, if the surface is over-treated a weak boundary layer on the surface will result due to too much polymer chain scission.<br>
Alkaline or acid solution<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the alkaline or acid solution is an aqueous solution.<br>
In one embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the acid solution comprises an acid in a concentration prefgerably between 0.7 N and ION, more preferably between IN and 7N, most preferably in a concentration between 1.5N and 5N.<br>
In another embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the alkaline comprises a base in a concentration betv/een IN and 7N, preferably in a concentration between 1.5N and 5N.<br>
12<br>
 <br>
	<br>
 <br>
It is no problem for a skilled person in etching to select from the above conditions of temperature, contact time and concentration of the alkaline or acid solution, a suitable combination of conditions to obtain the best adhesion results and brilliance of the layer of inorganic HRI-material. For example, the skilled person will know that by using higher concentrated acid solutions, a shorter contact time and temperature can be used.<br>
Adhesives<br>
The adhesive composition used in the processes, according to the present invention, preferably comprises a polymer having a plurality of hydroxyl-groups and a curing agent selected from the group consiting of polyisocyanates, polyepoxides and hydrolysed polyalkoxysilanes e.g. tetraalkyl orthosilicates.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the adhesive is an adhesive which self-cures ionically.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the adhesive is an adhesive which cures thermally.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the adhesive is an adhesive which self-cures via the release of water.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the adhesive is an adhesive which self-cures under ambient conditions.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the adhesive is an adhesive which self-cures at temperatures below 100°C, preferably below 80"C and particularly preferably below 50°C.<br>
Suitable polymers having a plurality of hydroxyl-groups include hydroxyl urethane prepolymers, polyvinyl alcohol, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate and gelatin.<br>
Suitable polyisocyanate compounds include aromatic and aliphatic polyisocyanates or polycyanate precursors, see section disclosing polyisocyanates and polyisocyanate precursors.<br>
The curing reaction is mainly based on the reaction between the isocyanate groups or the thermo-generated isocyanate groups and the free hydroxyl groups of the polymers comprising a plurality of hydroxyl-groups, but is also based on the formation of allophanate groups in a reaction of already formed urethane groups in the resin with isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate [D.H. Solomon "The Chemistry of Organic Film Formers" - John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York, (1967) p. 203].<br>

Polyisocyanate precursors<br>
Polyisocyanate precursors such as polyisocyanates with a blocking group to prevent reaction at room temperature which upon unblocking react with the polyhydroxy binders and polyhydroxy binders may be used in the adhesives used in the process and laminate according to the present invention.<br>
Polyisocyanates are thermally reversibly "blocked" with H-acidic components.  A proper selection of the "blocking agent" determines the reactivity, i.e. the splitting temperature of the blocked polyisocyanate and therefore the curing conditions of such an aliphatic, 1-component thermosetting polyurethane system. The following blocking agents are of commercial and technological interest: more important are 2-Butanone-oxime (methyl ethyl ketoxime,MEKO), s-caprolactam and to a limited extend 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In specific areas, especially in powder coatings, the uretdion/dimer structure is used to deactivate isocyanate groups thermally reversible without using blocking agents.<br>
Temperatures between 120 and 250°C are necessary to release the blocking groups which usually volatilize from the coating. The resulting polyisocyanates can react v/ith other active hydrogen-containing compounds to form more thermally stable urethane or urea linkages.  The dissociation temperatures of the labile bond of a blocked polyisocyanate depend on the structures of the polyisocyanates and the blocking groups utilized. Blocked polyisocyanates based on aromatic polyisocyanates dissociate at lower temperatures than those based on aliphatic ones. The dissociation temperatures of blocked polyisocyanates based on commercially utilized blocking agents decrease in this order: alcohols &gt; r-caprolactam &gt; phenols &gt; methyl ethyl ketoxime &gt; active methylene compounds.<br>
17<br>
 <br>
Blocked polyisocyanates can be used to cross-link both solvent-borne and waterborne resins. The blocked polyisocyanates offer wide formulation latitude. They can be added to the coreactant resins providing one-package coatings with excellent shelf life. These combinations result in cross-linked films within reasonable curing cycles. Coatings obtained show high-performance with the unique combination of high hardness and good flexibility. Coatings based on water-dispersible blocked polyisocyanate cross-linkers and suitable waterborne polymers approach the performance levels previously obtained only by solventborne coatings.<br>

The invention is illustrated hereinafter by way of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES and INVENTION EXAMPLES.  The percentages and ratios given in these examples are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The holograms used in the COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES and INVENTION EXAMPLES consisted of an embossed polymer :;oated with a ca. 100 niTi thick layer of zinc sulphide, a HRl-material, applied by a vacuum technique with an adhesive backing are available from Centre Grafico, FASVER and OVD.  The ca. 100 nm thick layer of zinc sulphide material applied by a vacuum technique such as vacuum evaporation or sputtering is amorphous and porous.<br>
INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 to 4 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
In INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 to 4 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 a hologram as described above was mounted on a 100 ^im thick poly(ethylene terephthalate) support.  The outermost surface of a ca. 100 nm evaporated zinc sulphide layer of an embossed polymer hologram on a 100 }.im thick poly (ethylene terephthalate) support v.'as conditioned by dipping in different aqueous solutions of alkali for<br>
20<br>
 <br>
the time given in Table 1, then washing with deionized water and drying at eo'c for 15 min.<br>
An adhesive composition was prepared by mixing 50 g of Liofol UK 3640, a polyurethane solvent (ethyl acetate) adhesive, with 1 g of Hardener Liofol UK 6800 layer and this composition was applied using a Braive coating apparatus with a 10 jum  wire-rod to the outermost surface of the foil of INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 to 4 with alkaline solution conditioning and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 without alkaline solution conditioning on the zinc sulphide-coated side of the support and was dried for 5 minutes at 50'C.<br>
The adhesive layer-coated side of the foils was then laminated to the polyethylene side of an identity-card simulating transparent laminate consisting of a 500 pm PETG sheet which had been laminated with a 12 jjm gelatin layer to a 35^m thick polyethylene foil with a EXECELAM 655Q laminator (from GMP Co. Ltd, Korea) at a temperature of 160°C at speed position 1.<br>
The delamination resistance of the resulting laminate was evaluated dry according to ISO/IEC 7810:1995 with an Instron in terms of peel strength.  The dry peel strength values were measured for the laminates of INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 to 4 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 and the values also given in Table 1.<br>
The effect of the alkaline solution conditioning and adhesive layer on the hologram brilliance was'also assessed.  There are no standard techniques for assessing the brilliance of holograms and therefore visual inspection in comparison with the uncoated hologram was the only option.  The brilliance was assessed by awarding numerical scores according to the following criteria:<br>
5	=	increased brilliance over that of the uncoated hologram<br>
4	=	comparable brilliance lo that of the uncoated hologram<br>
3	=	noticeably lower brilliance than that of the uncoated hologram<br>
2	=	substantially lower brilliance than that of the uncoated hologram<br>
1	=	hologram disappeared<br>
The numerical scores for the laminates of INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 to 4 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 3 are given in Table 1.<br>

The peel strength for the laminates of INVENTION EXAMPLE 1 to 4 with holograms conditioned with different alkaline solutions for different contact times exceeded the target value of &gt; 6 N/cm for identification cards, but that for the laminate of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 with the uncoated hologram exhibited a peel strength well below the target value of ^ 6 N/cm (the norm laid down in ISO 10373-1 is &gt;   3.5 N/cm).  The peel strength of the wetted laminates of INVENTION EXAMPLES 1 and 4 also fulfilled the target value of &gt; 6 N/cm for identification cards.<br>
A 0.65N sodium hydroxide solution is clearly insufficiently alkaline to realize the target wet peel strength of S: 6 N/cm in a short time.  On the other hand, the wet and dry peel strength realized by conditioning with a ION sodium hydroxide solution is well above ^ 6 N/cm, but the brilliance of the hologram is substantially reduced.  Conditioning with a 5N sodium hydroxide appears to provide a laminate with optimal balance in properties between a wet and dry peel strength above ^  6 N/cm and only a slight reduction in brilliance with a score of 3.<br>
INVENTION EXAMPLES 5 to 8 were prepared in the same way as INVENTION EXAMPLE 1, except that the treatment media (aqueous ammonium hydroxide or acetic acid solution) according to Table 2 were used with a contact time of 5 minutes at rooratemperature. No washing step was performed for INVENTION EXAMPLES 5 and 7. Washing with deionized water performed on INVENTION EXAMPLES 6 and 8. All INVENTION EXAMPLES 5 to 8 were dried for 5 minutes at 50°C. The same adhesion layer and polyethylene foil as for INVENTION EXAMPLE 1 were applied, before the wet peel strength was evaluated.<br>
