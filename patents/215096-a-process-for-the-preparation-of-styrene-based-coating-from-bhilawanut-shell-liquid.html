The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of styrene based coating from  Bhilament shell   <br>
for protection of bamboo surfaces. This invention will also lead to effective utilization of       <br>
plant based waste material Bhilanut shell liquid BSL)for the development of surface coatings with improved<br>
properties.<br>
Bamboo, because of excellent mechanical properties is an ideal timber substitute for many structural applications. Bamboo is having good mechanical properties but it has poor durability. It is highly affected by moisture penetration and deteriorates very fastly. When bamboo is exposed to out door condition especially when it is in contract with ground it is subjected to number of deteriorating influence including decay due to micro organism, fungi and degradation due to UV radiation of Sun light and it has poor resistance to corrosive atmosphere, which ultimately degrade bamboo and increase the cost due to frequent replacement while being used as a structural components. The protection of bamboo surface by BSL based coatings would help in saving the replacement cost.<br>
References may be made to Goldstein I.S. 1973, Degradation and protection of wood ln:Nicholas DD (ed) 1973, wood deterioration and its prevention by preservative treatments, Vol.I: degradation and protection of wood, Syracuse University Press, New York. PP 307-339, wherein coating materials like Phosphate, Ammonium Sulphate, borax and Zinc chloride have been used as protective coatings for cellulosic materials. The drawbacks of these coatings materials are lechability and poor resistance to corrosive atmosphere. They are not suitable for the structural purpose bamboo. The available information on the chemistry of Bhilawanut Shell Liquid (BSL) shows that it is a rich source of bhilawanol (C21 H32 O2) which is phenolic in nature and contains unsaturated side chain in meta position. The BSL also contains a small quantity of mono hydroxy phenol (Semicarpal) and a mixture of hydrocarbons. BSL is similar to<br><br>
Cashewnut Shell Liquid (CNSL) in its chemical properties as both contains substituted phenols namely bhilawanol and cardanol respectively. The composition in the present invention is based on BSL and styrene. Reference may be made to patent specification number 636644 wherein CNSL is treated with styrene and heated to 100° C for sixteen hours to get a nontacky, soft rubber like coating. There is no reference in the literature to BSL-Styrene coatings. The BSL -styrene coating developed in the present invention has more scratch hardness value than CNSL-styrene coating and has a quick drying time when compared to CNSL-styrene coating.<br>
Reference may be made to V. Sorna Gown and Mohini Saxena., Tnd., J., Chem., Tech., 1997, 228, 424 wherein CNSL was used to prepare CNSL - phenol formaldehyde and CNSL - styrene coatings and the drawbacks are, the coating are having poor resistance to acid medium and have poor mechanical film properties. The following table gives the mechanical film properties of CNSL based coatings.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of styrene based coating from Bhilawanut Shell Liquid(BSL) for the protection of bamboo surfaces useful for the protection of bamboo surfaces.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop surface coating from BSL utilizing to advantage its long side chain which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to obtain surface coatings suitable for the protection of bamboo surface from corrosive environments.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of styrene based coating from Bhilawanut Shell Liquid for protection of bamboo surface which comprises copolymerizing a mixture of styrene, Bhilawanut Shell Liquid and the initiator at a temperature ranging from 100°C to 150°C drying the said mixture by adding agents selected fromthe group consisting of cobalt naphthalate, lead naphthalate, manganese naphthalate, wherein, the mixture consists of:<br>
BSL	50 to 100 parts by weight<br>
Styrene	35 to 70 parts by weight<br>
Initiator	2.5 to 5.5 parts by weight<br>
Water	5    to 15 parts by weight<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the styrene used may be of a consideration in the range of 40 to 42%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention 0.3 to 0.4, 0.03 to 0.04, 0.003 to 0.004 weight % of the curing agents Co naphthanate, Pb naphthanate and Mn naphthanate respectively may be incorporated in the prepared coating to effect air drying.<br><br>
Fig. 1. of the drawing accompanying this specification represents the reaction mechanism for the preparation of styrene based coating of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides the preparation of styrene based coatings from Bhilawanut shell Liquid (BSL) for the protection of bamboo surfaces which essentially consist the preparation of BSL - styrene coating(IV) has been carried out by copolymerising a mixture of styrene(II), BSL(I) and the initiator (III) which are in the range of BSL, 50-100; Styrene, 35-70; initiator,2.5-5.5; and water 5-15 parts by weight and cured by adding curing agents such as Co naphthanate, Pb naphthanate and Mn naphthanate.<br>
The coating prepared by the process of the present invention is useful for protection of bamboo surfaces. The bamboo specimen may be prepared by splitting the culm in to two half horizontally and cut in to the size of 170 X 50 mm. These specimens may be dried at temperature of 103° ± 2 °C for one hour. After drying the surfaces may be roughened with emery paper. A selective coating of approximate coating thickness 50 u may be applied by brush and air dried. The specimen may be coated again and air dried.<br>
The BSL- styrene coating developed are having more scratch hardness value than the conventional CNSL-styrene coatings.<br>
The following example is given by way illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
The BSL - styrene coating is prepared by taking 100 parts by weight of BSL, taken in a three neck flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer and a Y adapter is heated to temperature of 125° C 1.3 parts of initiator Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide to be used is<br><br>
added to the system 70 parts by weight of styrene containing 2.7 parts by weight of initiator Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is then added dropwise through Y Adapter. After the addition is over, the remaining 1.4 parts by weight of initiator is added till the desired conversion of styrene monomer to polymer is obtained as evidenced by the reduced rate of reflux of the material. The ingredients are as follows :<br>
Reactants	Parts by weight<br>
BSL	100<br>
Styrene	70<br>
Methyl Ethyl Ketone peroxide	5.4<br>
To the coating so obtained a mixture of Co,Pb,Mn naphthanates of 0.3. 0.03,0.003 % respectively are added. The resultant coating is air drying.<br>
BSL -styrene coating described in this example has non- volatile matter 68%,viscosity 350 centipoise, Phone - value of 8.33, drying time 25 minutes and specific gravity of 0.87, the BSL-styrene coating has good resistance to acid medium. The coating passed both direct and indirect impact testing when subjected to 1 Kg weight from 70 cm. The scratch hardness value is 1.2 Kg and the thickness of the coating is 22  <br><br>
