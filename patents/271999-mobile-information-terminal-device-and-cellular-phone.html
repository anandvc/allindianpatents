The present invention relates to a mobile information terminal and a cellular phone, and more particularly, to improvement of a mobile inibrmation terminal provided with a sensor that detects an operating position with use of a phenomenon in which an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode is varied by a user operation. BACKGROUNDART 100021<br>
As a sensor capable of detecting a user operation to determine a corresponding operating position with use of a phenomenon in which an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode is varied by the user operation, an electrostatic capacitance type touch pad (hereinafter referred to as an eiectnjstatic pad) is known.    The electrostatic pad is a pointing device by which input depending on an operating position is provided, and used for scrolling a screen display and movement of a cursor.   The scrolling of a screen display and movement of a cursor are performed by sensing movement of the operating position, and if the electrostatic pad is traced with a finger, a corresponding moving direction is inputted.    Such electrostatic pad is easily formed into a thin shape and excellent in durability, as compared with operation keys each including a contact switching type switch in which electrical conduction is made between terminals by pressing, and has therefore conventionally been used in a mobile information terminal as an input device. 10003J<br>
 <br>
Ill gcnerai. a mobile inliirinaiion terminal such as a cellular phone or PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) is reqinred to be portable, and therelbre minialuri/ed.    On the other hand, the mniiat.tn-i/.alion ol'the electrostatic pad or operation keys in size without reducing operability has a limitation.    For this reason, in the mobile information terminal if the electrostatic pad and the operation keys are attempted to be both arranged, the electrostatic pad and operation keys may be often adjacently arranged, or the electrostatic pad ma\' be often arranged with overlapping with a part of the operation keys.    In particular, in the cellular phone often operated with a casing being held by one hand, from the perspective ol'better operability upon operation by one hand, the electrostatic pad and the operation keys may be often adjacently arranged.<br>

riie electrostatic pad 49 is a scn.sor for sensing a user operation to determine a position of the operation with use of a phenomenon in which an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode is varied by bringing a linger close thereto.    The electrostatic pad 49 is formed of a thin tllm arranged with a plurality of electrodes, and an electrostatic capacitance of each of the electrodes is detected. [0029J<br>

Here, it is assumed that the electrostatic pad 49 is of a rectangular shape that is longer in the shorter direction of the operation casing 4, and arranged between the display screen of the display 22 and the operation keys 42 to 48.    In particular, in the nip type cellular phone I, the electrostatic pad 49 is arranged between the hinge part 3 and the operation keys 42 to 48.

fig. 2 is a plan view illustrating an example of the electrostatic pad 49 in the cellular phone 1 of Fig. 1. in which electrode patterns 51 and 52 formed on a flexible board are illustrated.    Fhe electrostatic pad 49 includes the thin film formed with the electrode patterns 5 1 and 52 on the Hexible board, and in the present embodiment, it is assumed that the electrode patterns are formed of copper foil. 10032]<br>
l:ach of the electrode patterns 51 and 52 includes a plurality of hexagonally shaped electrodes that are linearly arranged, and forms a parasitic capacitance with a metallic object inside the casing.    A longer direction of the operation casing 4 is referred to as a Y direction, and a direction intersecting with the Y direction is referred to as an X direction.    The electrode pattern 51 is one in which the plurality of electrodes are arranged in the Y direction, whereas the electrode pattern 52 is one in which the plurality of electrodes are arranged in the X direction. [00331<br>
fhe electrode pattern 51 is arranged in the Y direction with five hexagonally shaped electrodes and two electrodes having a half-hexagonal shape, and the respective electrodes are electrically connected with a wiring pattern.    The electrode pattern 51 is one for detecting an operating position in the X direction, and a plurality of the electrode patterns 51 are arranged with being different in the X direction.    In this example, six electrode patterns 51 are formed ai: regular intervals, and respectively correspond to wiring patterns Xi (i ^ I to 6). 10034]<br>
13<br>
 <br>
The eleclrodc paltern 52 \&gt; arranged witli seven electrodes in the X direction, and the respective electrodes are electrically connected with a wiring pattern.    The electrode pattern 52 is one for detecting an operating position in the Y direction, and a plurality ot the electrode patterns 52 are arranged in different positions from each other in the Y direction,    in this example, six electrode patterns 52 are formed with regular intervals, and respectively correspcind to wiring patterns Yi (i = 1 to 6). 100,3 51<br>
.■\lso, it is assumed ihat each of the electrodes constituting the electrode patterns 51 and 52 is arranged so as to be surrounded by two adjacent electrodes in the Y direction and four adjacent electrodes in the X direction.    That is, each of the electrode patterns 51 and 52 is adapted to be a honeycomb pattern in which one electrode is surrounded by six adjacent electrodes. [0036]<br>
In general, when a linger comes close to the electrostatic pad 49, electrostatic capacitances are created between the electrodes of the electrostatic pad 49 and the finger, and therefore an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode pattern including an electrode closer to the finger is further increased.    In the electrostatic pad 49, such a variation in the electrostatic capacitance is detected to determine an operating position. [0037]<br>
Here, it is assumed that an electrostatic capacitance formed by each of the electrode patterns 51 is represented by Cxi (i = 1 to 6), and an electrostatic capacitance formed by each of the electrode patterns 52 is represented by Cyi (i = 1 to 6), respectively.    By monitoring these electrostatic capacitances Ck (k = xi, yi) to respectively specify, in the X and Y directions, electrode patterns of which electrostatic capacitances are varied, a two-dimensional position operated by a user is detected.<br>
 <br>
Note that each o1 tlic abo\c cleclrostalic capacitances Ck takes a combined value of the parasitic capacitance formed between each ofthe electrode patterns and a metallic object inside the casing and an electrostatic capacitance generated by bringing a finger or the like clo.se to the each ofthe electrode patterns upon operation. 10038]<br>
1-ig. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a configuration example in a main part ofthe cellular phone ! in Fig. 1. in which a part of a cross section that is parallel to the longer direction ofthe operation casing 4 and includes the guide key 45 is illustrated. The electrostatic pad 49 is formed with a part ofthe thin film thereof overlapping with at least a part of a kc} top 53 that is the pressing face ofthe guide key 45.    'The guide key 45 includes the kev top 53. a presser 56a of a PET sheet 56 arranged in the operation casing 4, a metal dome 57. and copper foil patterns 58a and 58b on a circuit board 58. I0039J<br>
The key top 53 is a decorative panel indicating the operation key, and printed with, for example, characters or the like indicating function assignment to the operation key.   The key top 53 is arranged between a decorative panel 54 on the hinge part 3 side and a decorative panel 54 on the guide key 46 side, and between the key top 53 and the decorative panel 54. a gap is provided.    The decorative panel 54 on the hinge part 3 side and the decorative panel 54 on the guide key 46 side are fixed to the operation casing 4, whereas the key top 53 is adapted to be vertically movable in a thickness direction ofthe operation casing 4. [0040]<br>
Specifically, by fitting the key top 53 on an urethane sheet 55 having flexibility bonded to an inside iace ofthe decorative panel 54, the key top 53 is adapted to be vertically movable with respect to the decorative panel 54.    The key top 53 and the<br>
15<br>
 <br>
uecorativc panel 54 are both made of a harder material than the urethane sheet 55: for example. s\ nthelic resin such as pol_\carbc&gt;naIe. or metal, and bonded to the urethane sheet 55 at key points. 10041)<br>
Below the urethane sheet 55. i.e., on the circuit board 58 side, the electrostatic pad 49 including the thin film formed with the electrode patterns on the flexible board is arranged to provide a configuration capable of detecting a variation in electrostatic capacitance of the pressing face oflhe key lop 5.3.    In this embodiment, the electrostatic pad 49 is arranged with overlapping with a whole of the key top 53 and a part of the decorative panel 54 on the hinge part 3 side.    An overlapping area AI between the electrostatic pad 49 and the guide key 45 is ibrmed in an end part of the thin film on a side opposite to the hinge part 3. 10042]<br>
Below the electrostatic pad 49, the PHI" sheet 56 made of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is arranged.   The P\iV sheet 56 is formed with the presser 56a protruding toward the circuit board 58, which transmits the vertical movement of the key top 53 to the metal dome 57.

a<br>
|)hone I is illustrated.    Tlie cellular phone 1 includes, in addition to the receiver 21, th displays 22 and 23. the camera 24. the transmitting microphone 41. and the operation keys 42 to 48. an electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 including the electrostatic pad 49, direction input control part 3 1, a key input part 32. a main control part 33. a display control part 34. a cellular communication part 35, and an operating position detecting part 37. 10048]<br>
The cellular communication part 35 is mobile communication processing means that transmits/receives a radio wave to/from a base station through a communication antenna.     I he main control part 33 performs a process on communication, a process of an image photographed by the camera 24. and other processes. 10049]<br>
The electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 includes the electrostatic pad 49, and a detecting circuit 36 that measures the electrostatic capacitances Ck (k = xl to x6, yl to Y6) in all of the electrode patterns of the electrostatic pad 49.    The electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 perf(;)nns an operation of outputting a result of the measured electrostatic capacitances as a sensor output. 10050]<br>
The operating position detecting part 37 performs operations of sensing user operation and determining a corresponding operating position on the basis of the sensor output of the electrostatic capacitance .sensor 30.    .Specifically, the respective electrostatic capacitances Ck are compared with a predetermined threshold to determine whether or not an electrode pattern of which an electrostatic capacitance exceeds the threshold is present, and thereby the user operation is sensed.    In this case, upon detection of such an electrode pattern, it is determined that the user operation has been<br>
 <br>
performed.    Note lliai as ihe abo\c predetermined threshold, each of the parasitic capacitances formed between the respecti\e electrode patterns and the metallic object inside the casing during non-operalion is preferably defined. 10051]<br>
Here, it is assumed that in the case where a plurality of electrode patterns of which eleclrostalic capacitances exceed the corresponding thresholds are detected, a position of the centroid of the electrode patterns, or a position of an electrode pattern having a ma.ximum electrostatic capacitance is determined as the operating position. Also, it is assumed that the term '"user operation" herein includes the case of sensing the operating position not only in the s,tate where a finger is in contact with the electrostatic pad 49, but also in a state where the linger is away from a surface of the pad. 100521<br>
fhe direction input control part 31 performs operations of, on the basis of the output of the operating position detecting part 37, sensing movement of the operating position and generating a direction input signal indicating a direction of the movement. The direction input signal is a control signal for instructing scrolling of a screen display or movement of a cursor, and upon sensing of the movement of the operating position, it is determined whether or not to generate the direction input signal, on the basis of an operating position upon start of the movement. [0053]<br>
Specifically, if the operating position upon start of the movement is outside an input start forbidden area on the electrostatic pad 49, the direction input signal is generated, whereas if it is inside tjie input start forbidden area, the direction input signal is not generated.    The input start forbidden area is an area where a direction input by the electrostatic pad 49 is forbidden, and formed on the thin film in relation to pressing faces<br>

Note that the operating position on Ihe electrostatic pad 49 refers to a contact position on the thin film at the time when a linger is brought into contact with the thin film of the electrostatic pad 49. and if the operating position is changed with the contact state being kept, the operating position is determined to be moved.    That is. by the operation of sliding the finger while bringing the finger into contact with electrostatic pad 49, a desired direction input is provided,    if, upon sensing of the movement of the operating position, the operating position on the electrostatic pad 49 upon start of the movement is inside the input start forbidden area, corresponding direction input becomes invalid.    It is assumed that the contact state herein includes not only the case where the finger and the electrostatic pad 49 are actually in abutting contact with each other, but also the case where the finger is slightly away from the electrostatic pad 49. f0055T<br>
fhe key input part 32 performs operations of detecting a user pressing operation on the pressing face of the operation key 42 to 48, and generating a key input signal corresponding to an operation key subjected to the pressing operation. 10056]<br>
fhe display control part 34 performs operations of displaying image information on the display screen of the display 22 or 23, and controlling a screen display on the basis of the direction input signal.    Specifically, on the basis of the direction input signal, a display position of the image information within the display screen is controlled,    for example, control for, in a direction indicated by the direction input signal, scrolling the screen display, or moving the cursor is performed.    Also,<br>

'1 he scrolling of the screen displa} is an operation of changing a display position, in which image information currently displayed within the screen is changed, for example, on a liiie-b_v-iinc basis.    Ilie movement of the cursor is an operation of changing a display position, in which a displayed object indicating an input position of a character is moved.   The movement of the highlight display is an operation of changing a display position of a highlight display or the like indicating a selected item in a menu, rhe movement of the mouse pointer is an operation of changing a display position of a mouse pointer (icon for displaying a position) on the screen. [0058]<br>
Here, it is assumed that the direction input signal indicating any of an upper direction, a lower direction, a left direction, or a right direction is generated, and the screen display is scrolled, the cursor is moved, or the highlight display is moved in the indicated direction.    Also, it is assumed thai, in the electrostatic pad 49, if a tapping operation with a linger is performed twice, i.e., a so-called double tap operation is performed, the same input process as in the case where the enter key 43 is subjected to a pressing operation is performed. [0059]<br>
fig. 7 is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of the electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 in the cellular phone 1 of Fig. 1.    The electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 performs an operation of measuring the electrostatic capacitances Ck (k = xl to x6, y I to y6) of the respective electrode patterns of the electrostatic pad 49 to output a result of the measurement as the sensor output.<br>

In general, in the case WIKMC a current not varied with time is supplied to charge a capacitor having an electrostatic capacitance Ck, as the electrostatic capacitance Ck is increased, it takes a longer time for the charging, in the electrostatic capacitance sensor .30, a correlationship between an electrostatic capacitance and a charging time is used to measure the respective electrostatic capacitances Ck. 10061]<br>
Specincally, the electrostatic capacitance sensor 30 includes: a capacitor having each of the electrostatic capacitances Ck, i.e., the electrostatic pad 4'): and a detecting circuit 36 including switches SWI and SW2, a constant current source i 1, a capacitor Cmod used for charging the electrostatic capacitance Ck, a comparator 12. a timer 13, and an electrostatic capacitance detecting part 14, and the each electrostatic capacitance Ck is determined on the basis of a time necessary to charge the electrostatic capacitance Ck up to a predetermined voltage. [0062]<br>
The switch SWI is connected in parallel with the electrostatic capacitance Ck, and by closing the switch SW 1, the electrostatic capacitance Ck can be discharged.    The switch SW2 is connected in scries with the capacitor Cmod, and by closing the switch SW2 with opening the switch SWI, the electrostatic capacitance Ck can be charged by charges accumulated in the capacitor Cmod.    An output of the constant current source 11 is supplied between the switch SW2 and the capacitor Cmod, and when the switch SW2 is opened, the capacitor Cmod is charged. [0063]<br>
A voltage applied to the capacitor Cmod is supplied to the comparator 12 through a low pass filter circuit.    The comparator 12 performs operations of comparing<br>
 <br>
the output voltage ofthe capacitor ("mod and a predetermined voltage Vref. and supplying a signal corresponding to a result ofthe comparison to the timer 13. 100641<br>
The timer 13 performs operations of measuring a time necessary for the output voltage ofthe capacitor Cmod to reach the voltage Vref after the switch SW2 is closed, and outpiilting a result of the measurement to the electrostatic capacitance detecting part 14.     fhe electrostatic capacitance detecting part 14 performs an operation of determining the electrostatic capacitance from the time necessary for the output voltage ofthe capacitor ("mod tt) reach the voltage Vref    The elcctro.static capacitance determination based on the measurement result ofthe timer 13 is sequentially made for all ofthe electrostatic capacitances Ck. and a determination result for each ofthe electrostatic capacitances ("k is outputted as the sen.sor output. [0065]<br>
Next, operations ofthe electrostatic capacitance .sensor 30 are described.    First, the capacitor Cmod is charged with the switches SWl and SW2 being opened.    Then, the switch SW1 is closed to discharge the electrostatic capacitance Ck. 10066]<br>
Subsequently, after the svntch SWl is opened, the switch SW2 is closed, and charges accumulated in the capacitor Cmod is used as a source to charge the electrostatic capacitance Ck.    At this time, the time necessary for the voltage applied to the electrostatic capacitances Ck and Cmod to reach the voltage Vref is measured in the timer 13, and a result ofthe measurement is outputted as the time necessary to charge the electrostatic capacitance Ck.    The electrostatic capacitance detecting part 14 determines the electrostatic capacitance Ck on the basis ofthe output ofthe timer 13.    Such a determination process of the electrostatic capacitance is repeatedly performed at a<br>

1 ig. 8 is a plan vie\\ illustrating a conllguration example in the main part of the cellular phone I in Pig. I. in which the electrostatic pad 49 formed with input start lorbiddcn areas A11. A2 I. and A3 I in relation lo the pressing faces of the operation keys 44. 4.5, and 47 is illustrated.    The respective input start forbidden areas A) I, A21, and A31 are areas on the thin llhn, each in which direction input by the electrostatic pad 49 is forbidden, and formed in relation to the respective pressing faces of the operation keys 44, 45, and 47. 10068]<br>
fhe guide keys 45 and 47 are both arranged with a whole of the pressing faces thereof overlapping with the thin film of the electrostatic pad 49.    Here, it is assumed that the guide key 45 is arranged with the key top part thereof being adjacent to a lower edge side and left edge side of the thin film, and the guide key 47 is arranged with the key top part thereof being adjacent to the lower edge side and a right edge side of the thin film.    That is, the guide key 45 is arranged in the lower left corner of the thin film, and the guide key 47 in the lower right corner. 10069]<br>
fhe direction key 44 is arranged with an upper part of the pressing face thereof overlapping with the thin film of the electrostatic pad 49.    Here, it is assumed that the direction key 44 is arranged with the key top part thereof overlapping with the lower edge side of the thin film.    The pressing faces of the operation keys 44, 45, and 47 are all arranged below the middle of the thin film. [0070]<br>
fhe input start forbidden areas A11, A21, and A31 are respectively formed as<br>
24<br>
 <br>
areas including (ncrla|nping areas A 12. A22. and :\32 with the operation ke}s. Here, it is assumed that an) of the respective input start forbidden areas A11, A21, and .•\31 is an area that is e.vpanded with a corresponding overlapping area facing outward. In the electrostalic pad 49. the input start forbidden areas are formed on the thin illm on a side opposite 10 the hinge part 3. and the hinge part 3 side is outside the input start forbidden areas. 10071j<br>
fig. 9 is a diagram illustrating an example of operations upon sensing of movement in the cellular phone I of Fig. 1, in which various types of direction inputs Bl to B5 of which operating positions upon start of movement when the electrostatic pad 49 is traced with a finger are illustrated.    The direction input \iI is one that starts to move inside the input start forbidden area .All. and completes the movement outside the input start forbidden areas, so that such direction input is invalidated.   The direction input B2 is one that starts to move outside the input start forbidden areas, and completes the movement inside the input start Ibi-bidden area A11. so that such direction input is valid, and a direction input signal indicating a moving direction, i.e., a lower direction in this case, is generated. [0072]<br>
Any of the two types of direction inputs B3 and B4 is one that starts to move outside the input start forbidden areas, and completes the movement outside the input start forbidden areas, so that such lypes of direction input are valid, and direction input signals indicating moving directions, i.e., an upper direction and a right direction in this case, are respectively generated.    The direction input B5 is one that starts to move inside the input start forbidden area A2I, and completes the movement inside the input start forbidden area A3 1, so that such direction input is also invalidated.<br>

10073(<br>
1 Icic it is assumed that, in the case where a linger is slid trom an area outside ihe electrostatic pad 49 to trace the electrostatic pad 49. if an initial operating position on the electrostatic pad 49 is inside any of the input start forbidden areas in the movement of an operating position, corresponding direction input is invalidated, whereas if the initial operation position is outside the input start forbidden areas, corresponding direction input is provided. I0074J<br>
As described above, in the present embodiment, when upward, leftward, or rightward movement of which an operating position upon start of the movement is inside any of the input start forbidden areas is sensed, corresponding direction input is invalidated, and upward, leftward, or rightward movement of image information is ibrbidden.    By configuring as above, an unintended direction input can be effectively prevented from being provided upon operation of the operation keys that are arranged below the middle of the electrostatic pad 49 with overlapping with the electrostatic pad 49. 10075]<br>
Steps SI 01 to SI 07 in Fig. 10 are respective steps of a flow chart illustrating an example of the operations upon sensing of movement in the cellular phone 1 of Fig. I. First, when the operating position detecting part 37 detects a user operation on the clectrostalic pad 49, it determines a position of the operation on the thin film, and outputs a result of Ihe determination to the direction input control part 31 (Step SlOl). I0076J<br>
When the direction input control part 31 senses, on the basis of the output from the operating position detecting part 37, movement of the operating position with a<br>
26<br>
 <br>
finger being in conlacl with the electrostatic pad 49. it generates a direction input signal indicating a direction of the movement {Step Sl()2).    When the movement of the operating position is sensed, an operating position upon start of the movement is determined, and it is determined whether or not to generate a direction input signal, depending on whether or not the operating position is inside any of input start forbidden areas (Steps SI03 and S104). 100771<br>
If the operating position upon start of the movement is inside any of the input start forbidden areas, a direction input is invalidated (Step S105).   On the other hand, if the operating position upon start of the movement is outside the input start forbidden areas, the direction input signal corresponding to a direction of the movement is generated, and a display position of image information is moved by the display control part 34 (Steps SI06 and SI07). [0078]<br>
According to the present embodiment, a direction input signal is appropriately generated depending on an operating position upon start of movement, and therefore upon operation of the operation keys that are arranged with overlapping with the electrostatic pad 49. a direction input for controlling a display position of image information can be suppressed form being erroneously provided.    In particular, by providing an input start forbidden area as an area where a direction input is desirably forbidden, the direction input signal is appropriately generated depending on whether or not the operating position upon start of the movement is inside an input start forbidden area, and therefore an unintended direction input can be prevented from being provided. Also, the input start forbidden area includes an overlapping area between a pressing surface and the thin film, and therefore a direction input of which an operating position<br>
27<br>
 <br>
upon Stan of mo\cincnt is ai leasi inside the overlapping area can be forbidden. 10079]<br>
Note that the present embodiment describes an example of the case wiiere the electrostatic pad is formed with overlapping with the pressing faces of the operation keys; however, the present invention is not limited to this.    For example, in the case where an operation key is arranged with a pressing face thereof being adjacent to the electrostatic pad. an area that is on the thin film and adjacent to the pressing face of the operation key may be defined as the input start forbidden area.    Alternatively, an area including a part of an overlapping area between the electrostatic pad and the operation key may be defined as the input start forbidden area. [0080]<br>

In each of the above embodiments, the cellular phone in which a part of the electrode pad overlaps with the operation key is described.    In an embodiment described below, a cellular phone provided with an electrode pad formed with a virtual key is described. [0090]<br>
 <br>
Meanwhile, in a notebook personal computer, there has been comcntionallv used an input device ihal moves a cursor (mouse pointer) on a screen by sliding a linger on an electrostatic pad. and provides input depending on a position of the cursor by an operation of lapping a surface of tlie pad. i.e., a so-called tap operation. 10091]<br>
A mobile information terminal such as a cellular phone, or PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) has a small casing, and a narrow arrangement space for operation keys as compared with the notebook personal computer, and therefore it is convenient to provide a plurality of input keys on an electrostatic pad to provide a key input.    In this case, by displaying an icon corresponding to each of the input keys on a screen, and upon key input, by sliding a Hnger on the electrostatic pad, a cursor on the screen is moved to select a desired input key.   In general, the mobile information terminal is often operated with the casing thereof being held by one hand.    For this reason, in the mobile information terminal as described above, there is a problem that in a case where an input key is selected, and then key input is provided by a tap operation, a finger should be once moved away from a pad surface upon the tap operation, resulting in poor operability.    In particular, in the case of the cellular phone, a one-handed operation is often performed, resulting in a problem of being extremely hard to operate. 10092]<br>
A sixth embodiment described below relates to a mobile information terminal and a cellular phone in which a phenomenon of an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode being varied when a finger is brought close to the pad is used to sense a user operation, and operability upon key input is improved.    In the present embodiment, in particular, in a ca.se where an electrostatic pad is operated by one hand to provide key input, the key input can be provided without moving a finger away from a surface of the<br>

Note that the same ccmponents as those in the above first embodiment are represented by the same reference numerals, and description thereof is omitted. 10094]<br>
The operation casing 4 is of a thin rectangular parallelepiped shape that is longer in the connecting direction, similar to the display casing 2, and arranged with a transmitting microphone 41, a plurality of operation keys 42a such as an on-hook key, an off-hook key, and a ten-key, and the electrostatic pad 49 on an operation face that is an inner casing face upon folding. [0095]<br>
kach of the operation keys 42a includes a contact switching type switch having a pressing face, and by pressing the pressing face, electrical conduction between terminals is made to thereby output a predetermined input signal. [0096]<br>
The cellular phone can transit between an expanded state where both of the casings are expanded with a display face and the operation face facing in the same direction, and a containing .state where both of the casings are folded with the display<br>

The electrostatic pad 49 is a sensor for sensing a user operation with u.se of a phenomenon in which an electrostatic capacitance of an electrode is varied by bringing a finger close thereto, and determining a position of the operation.    The electrostatic pad 49 is Ibniied of a thin film arranged with a plurality of electrodes, and an electrostatic capacitance oj each of the electrodes is detected. 10098J<br>

In pailicular, in the Hip type cellular phone ], the electrostatic pad 44 is arranged between a hinge part 3 and the operation keys 42a.    We also assume that the electrostatic pad 49 is adapted such that a width thereof, i.e.. a horizontal length thereof is comparable to that of the display screen of the display 22. |0099j<br>
In the cellular phone ]. a plurality of virtual keys are formed on the electrostatic pad 49. and locations of the respective virtual keys are displayed on the display screen of the display 22.    fhe virtual keys are input keys that can be respectively assigned with different functions depending on an operational situation, and also input keys of which sizes, locations, number, and the like can be changed as necessary.   In this example, the display screen of the display 22 is provided in a location different from those of the virtual keys. fOlOOJ<br>
Here, it is assumed that icons indicating the locations of the respective virtual<br>

lor example, the increase in pressing force is detected on the basis ofa variation in electrostatic capacitance of an electrode pattern arranged adjacent to an electrode pattern at the operating pt)sition.    .Alternalively, the increase in pressing force is detected on the basis ofa variation in electro.static capacitance of an electrode pattern arranged within a predetermined distance from the operating position. 10105]<br>
in general, if a linger is more tlrmly pressed with being in contact with the electrostatic pad 49, the Iinger is compressed due to an increase in pressing force, and therefore a distance between the electrostatic pad 49 and the iinger becomes shorter.   In the pressing operation detecting part 38, such an increase in pressing force on the electrostatic pad 49 is detected on the basis ofa variation in electrostatic capacitance around an operating position.

The display control part 34 performs an operation of displaying image informatittn on the display screens of the displays 22 and 23.    In the present embodiment, there are performed operations of displaying on the display screen of the display 22 the locations of the virtual keys on the electrostatic pad 49, and also displaying an operating position detected by the operating position detecting part 37 on the same display screen,    fhe display of the locations of the virtual keys is provided by displaying the icons indicating the virtual keys in the key location display area 22a in relation to the locations on the electrostatic pad 49.<br>

Tlie dispki} olThc operating position is provided b) displaying a cursor indicating the operating position in relation to the operating position on the electrostatic pad 49.    The cursor is an icon lor displaying a position, and in the present embodiment, when a linger is brought chise to the electrostatic pad 49, the cursor is displayed at a position corresponding to the operating position. I0I08J<br>
ll is assumed that, even in the present embodiment, by sliding a finger on the electrostatic pad 49 with the finger being in contact with it, the cursor moves upward, downward, leftward, or rightward. 10109 j<br>
The virtual key operation input part 39 performs an operation of, if an increase in pressing force is detected by the pressing operation detecting part 38, generating an operation input signal of a virtual key on the basis of an operating position detected by the operating position detection part 37.    fhe operation input signal of the virtual key is an input signal generated according to the operating position on the electrostatic pad 49. On the basis of such an operation input signal, a function assigned to the virtual key at the operating position is performed. [0110]<br>
Specifically, if an increase in pressing force is detected after an operation at the time a user slides his/her linger on the electrostatic pad 49 while bringing the finger into contact with the pad, an operation input signal is generated on the basis of an operating position upon detection of the increase in pressing force.    1 hat is, if a series of operations is performed, i.e.. the sliding operation of sliding the finger on the electrostatic pad 49 without moving the finger away from the electrostatic pad 49, and<br>

Such a virtual key is assigned with, for example, a function of activating a web browser, or browsing an electronic mail.    Alternatively, it is assigned with a photographing function using the camera 24, or a browsing function for an address book. 10112)<br>
figs. 14 (a) and (b) are plan views illustrating a conilguration example in a main part of the cellular phone 1 in Fig. 12.    Fig. 14 (a) illustrates icons 22b displayed in the key location display area 22a in relation to locations of virtual keys 49a on the electrostatic pad 49.    Fig. 14 (b) illustrates the plurality of virtual keys 49a formed on the electrostatic pad 49. 10113]<br>
The respective virtual keys 49a are input keys that can be respectively assigned with different functions depending on an operational situation, and sizes and locations of the respective input keys, and the number of the input keys are changed as necessary.    In this example, the virtual keys 49a are arrayed in a matrix form of 2 rows by 4 columns. 10114]<br>
The icons 22b are arranged with relative positions of the virtual keys 49a to the electrostatic pad 49 and relative positions of the icons 22b to the key location display area 22a coinciding with each other.    In this example, icons "Key 1" to "Key 4" are arranged in an upper row. and icons "'Key 5" to "Key 8" are arranged in a lower row. 10115]<br>
Fig. 15 is a diagram illustrating an example of operations upon key input by the<br>

 <br>
electrostatic pad 49 in the cellular plione I oll-'ig. 12. i]i which a situation wiierc a finger is slid on the electrostatic pad 49 and then the kc}' input is provided by firmly pressing the electrostatic pad 49 is illustrated.    If the linger is brought close to the electrostatic pad 49 upon operation of the virtual keys 49a, a corresponding operation is sensed, and a cursor A1 is displa\ ed at a position in the display screen corresponding to a sensed operating position.    1 hen, if the finger is slid on the electrostatic pad 49 with being in contact with the electrostatic pad 49. the cursor A1 can be moved. |0II6|<br>
B} sliding the finger on the electro.static pad 49 to move the cursor A1 to a desired icon 22b, and when the cursor AI is positioned on the desired icon 22b. by more firmly pressing the linger with the finger being in contact w ith the electrostatic pad 49, the pressing operation is sensed as llrm press, and an operation input signal corresponding to the operating position is generated. [01171<br>
In this example, the operation is sensed at a position of the icon "Key 5" illustrated in Fig. 14 (a), and display of the cursor A1 is started.    Then, by sliding the finger rightward, the cursor AI is moved to a position of the icon "Key 7". and by subsequent firm press, an operation input of a virtual key 49a corresponding to the icon ■'Key 7" is provided. 10118]<br>
I igs. 16 (a) and (b) are diagrams illu.strating an appearance of a finger in the case where the finger is more firmly pressed with being in contact with the electrostatic pad 49.    Fig. 16 (a) illustrates an appearance as viewed from a side face side of the operation casing 4. and Fig. 16 (b) illu.strates an appearance as viewed from a tip side of the finger,    in a state where the finger is slightly pressed against the electrostatic pad 49,<br>
 <br>
a pressiiiii force on the linger is snialL so thai dclbrmation of the linger is small, and an area ol a contact part Bl between ihe finger and a surface of the pad is also small. [0119]<br>
if. from this state, the finger is more firmly pressed against the electrostatic pad 49, the deformation of the finger becomes larger, and an area of a contact part B2 between the finger and the pad surface is large. iOI2()|<br>
(liven that the center C1 of the finger as viewed from the tip side is defined as the centroid in a cross-sectional shape of the finger, a distance between the finger and the electrostatic pad 49 can be considered as a distance between the center CI and the pad surface.    In the state where the finger is slightly pressed, the distance between the center CI and the pad surface is dl, whereas in the slate where the linger is more tirmly pressed, the distance between the center CI and the pad surface is d2 (d2 
In the present embodiment, such closeness of the finger in the contact state is sensed as an increase in pressing force in a user operation, and then a key input is provided. 10122]<br>
Fig. 17 is a diagram illuslrating an example of operations upon detection of pressing operation in the cellular phone 1 oi'Fig. 12, in which electrostatic capacitance distributions before (distribution indicated by dashed line) and after firm press (distribution indicated by solid line) are illustrated.    A state before the firm press corresponds to the state where the linger is slightly pressed against the electrostatic pad<br>
39<br>
 <br>
49,    The electrostatic capacitance distribuiinn in this state has a maximum at an operating position al. and is represented by a curve that approaches a constant value CO as a position is moved away iVom ihe operating position al. 101231<br>
On the other hand, a stale after the llrm press corresponds to the .state where the linger is more firmly pres.sed against the electrostatic pad 49, and the electrostatic capacitance distribution in this stale has large electrostatic capacitances around the operating position al as compared with the electrostatic capacitance distribution before the firm press,    for example, an electrostatic capacitance at a position a2 is increased by bl than that before the llrm press. 101241<br>
In the present embodiment, on the basis of such a variation in electrostatic capacitance around the operating position al, the pressing operation on the electrostatic pad is .sensed, and a key input is provided.    Speciilcally, on the basis of a variation in electrostatic capacitance of an electrode pattern positioned around the operating position al, i.e., an electrode pattern adjacent to an electrode pattern at the operating position al, or an electrode pattern within a predetermined distance from the operating position al, the pressing operation is sensed. [0125]<br>
Note that, if a resolution upon determination of the operating position al. i.e., a density of electrodes on the electrostatic pad 49 is small as compared with a displacement of the linger on the electrostatic pad 49. it is considered that there occurs a case where slight movement of the linger on the electrostatic pad 49 cannot be determined.    In order to accurately detect the pressing operation even in such a case, a variation in pressing force is desirably determined from variations of electrostatic<br>
40<br>
 <br>
capacitances of two or more clcttrode patterns. 10126]<br>
l-or example, the variation in pressing force may be determined on the basis of variations of electrostatic capacitances of three electrode patterns arranged around the operating position a I.    In this case, from the perspective of preventing the slight movement of the linger on the electrostatic pad 49 from being erroneously detected as the pressing operation (tlrmly pressing operation), electrostatic capacitances of electrode patterns positioned on sides opposite to each other with respect to the operating position al are monitored, and the variation in pressing force is desirably determined from variations of the electrostatic capacitances of these electrode patterns. 10127]<br>
In this example, there is provided a case where the variation in pressing force is determined on the basis ol'variations (bl and b2 respectively) of electrostatic capacitances of two electrode patterns (positions a2 and a3) positioned on the sides opposite to each other with respect to the operating position al.    According to such a configuration, the slight movement of the linger slightly pressed against the electrostatic pad 49 can be prevented iVoin being erroneously sensed as the pressing operation. 10128]<br>
Steps S201 to S2()6 of Fig. 18 are respective steps of a flow chart illustrating an example of operations of the cellular phone I in Fig. 12, in which processing steps upon a key input by the electrostatic pad 49 are illustrated.    First, when the operating position detecting part 37 .senses a user operation on the electrostatic pad 49. it determines an operating position, and outputs a result of the determination (Steps S201 and S202). 10129]<br>
I hen, the display control part 34 displays, the cursor Al indicating the<br>
41<br>
 <br>
operating position in the ilispkn screen (Step S?.03) on the liasis of ihe determination result b}' the operating position detecting part 37.    1 he displa} control part 34 repeats processing steps of Steps S202 and S203 until a variation in pressing force is detected by the pressing operation detecting part 38, or an operation on the electrostatic pad 49 is terminated. 101301<br>
When the variation in pressing force is detected by the pressing operation detecting part 38. the virtual key operation input part 39 generates an operation input signal ol'the virtual key 4'&gt;a on the basis of the operating position upon detection of the variation in pressing force (Steps S204 and S205).    On the other hand, if the operation on the electrostatic pad 49 is terminated before the detection of the variation in pressing force, the key input operation is terminated without generating the operation input signal (StepS206). 10131]<br>
According to the present embodiment, an increase in pressing force on the electrostatic pad 49 is detected to provide a key input, and therefore if the electrostatic pad 49 is operated to provide the key input, the key input can be provided without moving a finger away from the electro.static pad 49.    Accordingly, operability for the case where the finger contact is sen.sed to provide the key input can be improved.    Also, if the finger is brought close to the electrostatic pad 49, the cursor A1 appears at a position to be operated, and therefore a displacement of the cursor A1 upon key input can be suppressed as compared with a case where the cursor A1 is constantly displayed. [0132]<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, there is described the case where an operating position is displayed by the cursor A1, and the cursor is moved when a finger<br>
42<br>
 <br>
is slid on the ciectroslaiic pad 4"-): ho^\eve^. the present iri\'cnlioii is not limited to this, l-or example, the operating position ma\' be displayed by highlighting (reverse display or the like) the icon 22b indicating the virtual key 49a. and a display position of the highlight displa\ may be changed when the finger is slid. I01.33J<br>
Also, in the present embodiment, there is described the case where a variation in pressing force is detected on the basis of variations of electrostatic capacitances of electrode patterns arranged around an operating position; however, the present invention is not limited to this,    for example, a contact area between a linger and the electrostatic pad 49 may determined on the basis of the number of electrt)de patterns of which electrostatic capacitances exceed a predetermined threshold, and the variation in pressing force ma} be detected on the basis of a result of the determination.
