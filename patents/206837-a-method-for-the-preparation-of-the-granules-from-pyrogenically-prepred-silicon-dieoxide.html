				<td>The invention relates to granules based on pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide, the method for their preparation and the use thereof as catalyst supports.<br>
The preparation of pyrogenic silicas or silicon dioxides from SiCl4 by means of high-temperature-or flame hydrolysis is known (Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, Volume 21, page 464 (1982)).<br>
Pyrogenic silicon dioxides are distinguished by having extremely fine particles, high specific surface (BET), very high purity, spherical particle shape and the absence of pores. On account of these properties pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxides are attracting increasing interest as supports for catalysts (Dr. Koth et al., Chem. Ing. Techn. 52, 628 (1980)). For this application the pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide is shaped by mechanical means, for example, tabletting machines.<br>
The shaping of pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide into sprayed granules also by means of spray drying, to obtain a starting material for sintered ceramic materials, is also known (DE-A.36 11 449).<br>
It is also known that silicon dioxide pyrogenically prepared in an electric arc may be shaped by means of spray drying into sprayed granules, which can be used as adsorption media or else as catalyst supports (DE-A 12 09 108).<br>
The subjection of pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide to a gel process and the subsequent shaping into granules by means of spray drying is also known. These granules, after<br><br>
2<br>
coating with chromium oxide, are used in the polymerisation of ethylene (EP-A 0 050 902, US-A 4,386,016).<br>
Furthermore, the use of precipitated silicon dioxide as a catalyst support for the catalytic polymerisation of olefins is known (WO 91/09881).<br>
The known sprayed granules of pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxides have the disadvantage that they are not optimally suitable for use as catalyst supports, for example, in the production of polyethylene.<br>
The object was therefore the development from pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide of sprayed granules which can be used as catalyst supports in _the production of polyethylene.<br>
The present invention provides granules based on pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide and having the following physicochemical properties:<br>
Average grain size:        10 to 120  m<br>
2<br>
BET surface area:	40 to 400 m /g<br>
Pore volume:	0.5 to 2.5 ml/g<br>
Pore size distribution:    less than 5 % of the total pore<br>
volume exists of pores with a diameter 
pH value:	3.6 to 8.5<br>
Tapped density:	220 to 700 g/1<br>
The granular material according to the invention can be prepared by dispersing pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide in water, spray drying it and heating the granules obtained at a temperature of from 150 to 1,100 C for a period of 1 to 8 h.<br><br>

The invention also provides granules based on pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide and having the following physicochemical properties:<br>
Average grain size:     10 to 120  m<br>
o BET surface area:       40 to 400 m2/g<br>
Pore volume:	0.5 to 2.5 ml/g<br>

Carbon content:	0.3 to 15.0 wt.%<br>
pH value:	3.6 to 8.5<br>
Tapped density:	220 to 700 g/1<br>
The granular material according to the invention preferably has meso- and macropores, with the volume of the mesopores constituting 10 to 80% of the total pore volume.<br>
The carbon content of the granular material according to the invention may be from 0.3 to 15.0 wt.%.<br><br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the proportion of pores smaller than 5  m may be at most 5% referred to the total pore volume.<br>
The granular material according to the invention can be prepared by dispersing pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide in water, spray drying it, heating the granules obtained at a temperature of from 150 to l,100°C for a period of 1 to 8 h and then silanising them. The same halosilanes, alkoxysilanes, silazanes and/or siloxanes described above can be used for the silanisation.<br>
The invention further provides a method for the preparation of granules based on pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide, which is characterised in that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide, preferably silicon dioxide prepared from silicon tetrachloride, by means of- flame hydrolysis, is dispersed in water, spray dried, the granules obtained are optionally heated at a temperature of from 150 to l,100°C for a period of 1 to 8 h and/or silanised.<br>
The dispersion in water can have a silicon dioxide concentration of from 5 to 25 wt %<br>
The spray drying can be carried out at a temperature of from 200 to 600°C. Disc atomisers or nozzle atomisers can be used for this purpose.<br>
The heating of the granules can be carried out both in fixed beds, for example chamber kilns, and in moving beds, for example rotary dryers.<br><br>

The silanisation can be carried out using the same halosilanes, alkoxysilanes, silazanes and/or siloxanes as described above, for which the silanising agent can be optionally dissolved in an organic solvent such as, for example, ethanol.<br>
Preferably the silane Si 108 [(CH3O)3-Si-C8H17], Jtrimethoxyoctylsilane, is used as silanising agent.<br>
The silanisation can be carried out by spraying the granular material with the silanising agent and subsequently heat-treating the mixture at a temperature of from 105 to 400°C over a period of 1 to 6 h.<br>
In an alternative method, the silanisation of the granules can be carried out by treating the granular material with the silanising agent in vapour form and subsequently heat-treating the mixture at a temperature of from 200 to 800 C over a period of 0.5 to 6 h.<br>
The heat treatment can take place under protective gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The silanisation can be carried out continuously or batchwise in heatable mixers and dryers equipped with spraying facilities. Examples of suitable devices are ploughshare mixers, disk dryers or fluidised bed dryers. ¦<br>
The physicochemical variables of the granules, such as the specific surface, the particle size distribution, the pore volume, the tamped density and the silanol group concentration, the pore distribution and pH value can be altered within the specified limits by varying the starting materials and the conditions during-spraying-heating_and_ silanisation.<br><br>

They have the advantage of possessing a high purity, a high thermostability, a low silanol group concentration, primary particles microspherical in shape and less than 5 % of the total pore volume exists of- pores with a diameter 
The invention further provides the use of the granules as catalyst supports, in particular for the production of polymerisation catalysts. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the granules according to the invention can be used as catalyst supports for producing catalysts for the production of polyethylene.<br>

To prepare the silicon dioxides, a liquid silicon compound is sprayed into an oxyhydrogen flame consisting of hydrogen and air. In most cases silicon tetrachloride is used. This substance is hydrolysed to silicon dioxide and hydrochloric acid by the action of the water formed during the hydrogen-oxygen reaction. After leaving the flame, the silicon dioxide enters a so-called coagulation zone, wherein the primary Aerosil particles and primary Aerosil aggregates agglomexate. The product, which exists at this stage as a kind of aerosol, is separated from the accompanying gaseous substances in cyclones and then aftertreated with moist heated air.<br>
By this process the residual hydrochloric acid content can be lowered to 0.025%. As the silicon dioxide obtained at the end of this process has a bulk density of only about 15 g/1, there is a subsequent vacuum compaction, whereby tamped densities of about 50 g/1 and more can be established.<br>
The particle si,zes of the silicon dioxides can be varied by means of the reaction conditions such as, for example, flame temperature, proportions of hydrogen and oxygen, quantity of silicon tetrachloride, residence time in the flame or length of the coagulation path.<br>
The BET surface area is determined using nitrogen in accordance with DIN 66 131.<br>
The pore volume is calculated from the sum of the micro-, meso- and macropore volumes. The micro- and mesopores are determined by recording an N2. isotherm and evaluation thereof by the methods of BET, de Boer and Barrett, Joyner and Halenda. The macropores D &gt; 30 nm are determined by the Hg porosimetry method. For the determination of the macropores, the sample is dried for 15 h at 100O C in the drying oven and degassed at room temperature in a vacuum.<br><br>
13<br>
For the determination of the micro- and mesopores, the sample is dried for 15 h at 100 C in the drying oven and degassed for 1 h at 200°C in a vacuum.<br>
The silanol group concentration is determined by the lithium alanate method. Here the SiOH- groups are reacted with LiAlH4 and the quantity of hydrogen formed during this reaction is determined from the pressure. <br>
Principle of measurement<br>
The granular material is weighed into a four-necked flask. The flask is evacuated and an oil bath is heated to .150O C The temperature in the flask (controlled by an internal thermometer) rises with the temperature of the oil bath to about 130 C. The pressure during the preliminary treatment<br>
is recorded using a pressure measuring device PI2 (TM 210,<br>
3      -3 from Leybold, measuring range 10  to 10  mbar) . The<br>
desorption of the water can be monitored from the pressure measurement. At the end of the preliminary treatment<br>
(30 min at the end temperature) a pressure of less than<br>
-2 10  mbar must have been achxeved.<br>
.After completion of the preliminary treatment, the evacuated flask is separated from the vacuum unit by closing the stop valve and is brought to normal temperature. The actual measurement is based on a measured quantity of LiAlH4 solution being introduced into the flask through the dropping funnel and the rise in pressure being measured from the hydrogen formed. If the volume of the flask is known, the quantity of H2 can be calculated from the ideal gas law. The pressure is recorded using a digital measuring device (PI1) (MKS Instruments PR-2000), having a measuring range of between 0 and 1 bar.<br>
The LiAlH4 solution used (2% LXALH4 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) is degassed prior to the experiment being<br><br>
14<br>
carried out, in order to remove readily volatile constituents, which distort the pressure measurement. For this purpose the pressure above the solution in the dropping funnel is lowered by a second vacuum pump to the vapour pressure (3.7 mbar at 22°C), so that the liquid boils. A blank measurement without a sample is taken to test whether the solution is sufficiently degassed. In the determination of the hydrogen pressure, a correction* is made using the vapour pressure of the solvent.<br>
Interpretation<br>
The apparatus is calibrated by first of all determining the volume of the dropping funnel provided with a ground-glass stopper, gauging the'capacity in litres. The volume of the reaction flask inclusive of all connections as far as the stop valve is obtained by the following experiment:<br>
The dropping funnel, filled with air at atmospheric pressure, is attached to the evacuated flask. A pressure compensation between the two volumes is then brought about by opening the tap of the dropping funnel. The pressure established is indicated by the digital measuring device. The volume of the reaction vessel is obtained from the mass balance. A volume VR  equal to 243.8 ml is obtained with the present arrangement.<br>
vcorr. - VR - vsolids - vsolution<br>
The number of moles of hydrogen formed ,is obtained from the equations:<br><br><br>
15<br>
p is the increase in pressure in the reaction flask. This value is corrected by an amount corresponding to the vapour pressure of the solvent {3.7 mbar at 22 C). At room temperatures greatly differing from 22 C the vapour pressure is taken from the vapour pressure table. It is useful so to select the weighed sample, that a value for p of between 200 and-800 mbar is obtained. In this case minor changes in the vapour pressure owing to temperature variations have hardly any effect on the result.<br>
The volume of the reaction vessel is corrected by deducting the volume of solid matter and the volume of the solution introduced. The former is given from the weighed portion and the density and the latter is read from the dropping funnel. ¦<br>
The density of silanol groups is finally obtained from the equation:<br><br>
NL: Lohschmidt number<br>
F:  Surface of the weighed solid matter<br>
The samples are treated as follows:<br>
1 h heating at 120°C and 0.2 mbar; cooling to 60°C; addition of LiAlH4; after 10 mins, reading the pressure difference which has arisen.<br>
The particle size distribution is determined by means of the laser optical particle size analyser Cilas Granulametre 715.<br><br>

Preparation of the granules according to the invention<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide is dispersed in completely demineralised water. A dispersing aggregate which operates according to the rotor/stator principle is used in the process. The suspensions formed are spray dried. The finished product is precipitated by a filter or cyclone.<br>
The sprayed granules are heated in a muffle furnace.<br>
The spray-dried and optionally heated granules are placed in a. mixer for the silanisation process and sprayed with intensive mixing optionally first of all with water and then with the silane Si 108 (trimethoxyoctylsilane) or HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane). After spraying has been completed, the material is mixed for 15 to 30 more minutes and then heated for 1 to 4 h at 100 to 400°C.<br>
The water used can be acidified with an acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, to a pH value of 7 to 1. The silanising agent used can be dissolved in a solvent such as, for example, ethanol.<br><br>
