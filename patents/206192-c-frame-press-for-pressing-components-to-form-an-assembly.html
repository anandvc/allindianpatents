				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a C-Frame Press for pressing components to form an assembly.<br>
C-frame press comprises of a hydraulic cylinder located at the upper end of the press, and a hydraulic power pack located at the lower end of the press. This press is especially used for assembling water pumps. The pressing force of the hydraulic cylinder is varied depending on the size and tolerance of the components.<br>
In the known press operations, the following are the deficiencies:<br>
1.   It is not possible to know the loads at various pressing strokes during pressing operations.<br>
2.   It is not possible to measure the exact stroke/distance the ram moves.<br>
3.   Due to the variations in the components accuracies/ tolerances the force on the ram varies. Hence one cannot expect uniform load on the component during pressing.<br>
4.   Hence it requires stringent inspection of the components before taking the assembly on these presses.<br>
5.   It requires to check/inspect the component after assembly by applying pulling force to verify whether the pressing force for interference is correct or not.<br>
6.   Hence component acceptance or rejection will be known only after pressing and during inspection.<br>
-2-<br>
The present invention will overcome all the above problems and also have the following automation in the presses:<br>
a)   Measures the force experienced during pressing operation.<br>
b)   Measures the exact distance moved by the ram during any instant of time.<br>
c)   It compiles the measured data and fits in the ideal curve of force v. distance. More than the allowable deviation, if any, is indicated automatically. The component is rejected for deviation in the initial stages itself.<br>
d)   Prior inspection of components is eliminated.<br>
e)   Final inspection after assembly is also eliminated. Accordingly, the present  invention provides  a C-frame<br>
press for pressing components to form an assembly, said press<br>
comprising a hydraulic  cylinder at  the upper  end of  the<br>
press, a hydraulic power  pack at the lower end of the press<br>
for actuating the ram of the hydraulic  cylinder up and down<br>
and a fixture  located below  the  ram for  mounting  the<br>
components to be assembled together, characterised by;_<br>
a load cell  bolted to  the  said ram  for  recording loads<br>
required;<br>
a linear variable  displacement  transducer mounted on  the<br>
hydraulic cylinder and fixture  for recording displacement;<br>
and<br>
-3-<br>
an electric control panel to which said load cell and transducer are connected so as to control the operation of the hydraulic cylinder.<br>
In the  accompanying drawings  showing  a  preferred embodiment of the present invention, -<br>
Fig. 1 shows front view of the C-frame press according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows side view of the press of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 shows plan view of the press of Fig. 1; Fig. 4 shows  side view of the upper portion of the press of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 5 shows two components prior to their assembly; Fig. 6 shows  the components  of Fig.  4  in  the  assembly condition; and Fig. 7 shows a schematic block diagram.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show the assembling of a bracket pulley 1 on a bearing. The pulley 1 has a hole 3 which fits over a shaft 4 of the bearing 2. The hole 3 has an inner diameter 0D which must match with the outer diameter 0d of the shaft 4. The variation between the diameters 0D and 0d should be within tolerance limits. If the inner diameter 0D of the hole 3 exceeds the tolerance limit, the pulley will fit loosely on the bearing shaft and is likely to fly off the shaft and damage other parts. On the other hand, if the outer diameter of the shaft exceeds the tolerance limit, during assembly itself the pulley will not fit on the shaft and as a result both are likely to be damaged.<br>
-4-<br>
The present invention proposes to overcome these problems. From Figs. 1 to 4 and 7, it can be seen that C-frame press 5 comprises a hydraulic cylinder 6 at the upper end of the press, a hydraulic power pack 7 located at the lower end of the press, and a fixture 8 located between the hydraulic cylinder and the power pack. An electric control panel 9 which can be a CPU is provided at the top of the press, preferably at a corner thereof. The control panel enables operation of the machine automatically as well as manually.<br>
The hydraulic cylinder 6 has a ram 6' which is moved vertically up and down by means of hydraulic fluid supplied by the hydraulic power pack 7. The power pack 7 supplies hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic cylinder 6 at required pressure depending on instructions from the electric control panel 9 so that ram 6' of the hydraulic cylinder 6 moves up and down vertically.<br>
The fixture 8 mounted on the press is aligned with the ram of the hydraulic cylinder. One of the components to be assembled is placed on a base plate of the fixture, the base plate being clamped on to the C-frame 10 of the press. The fixture 8 has also a top plate to which the other component to be assembled is secured.<br>
When the hydraulic power pack is actuated, it moves the ram downwardly by giving signals to press the other component onto the said one component. In Fig. 1, the components to be fitted are shown to  be  a bracket pulley 1 and a bearing 2.<br>
-5-<br>
Bearing 2 forms  part of  an impeller 11 having a water pump body 12.<br>
On the moving part of the fixture 8 is provided a load cell 13, which is bolted through an adopter 13' to the ram 6' of the hydraulic cylinder. The load cell records the loads required for pressing.<br>
The power pack 7 preferably comprises a pump 7' driven by an electric motor. The pump supplies hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic cylinder at required pressure. A directional control valve provides flow of hydraulic fluid from the power pack to the hydraulic cylinder and vice versa. A relief valve is provided for setting the pressure needed for pressing the ram of the hydraulic cylinder.<br>
A linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) 14 is fitted to the hydraulic cylinder and the fixture. The transducer 14 measures the displacement of the component 1 to be fitted on the component 2 and has a digital indicator for indicating the distance of displacement.<br>
From the records of this transducer, the output can be taken and a graph can be drawn and the range of pressing can be set at maximum or minimum. The load cell 13 and LVDT 14 are connected to the CPU 9. If the load exceeds the maximum of the range, the two components will not match because there will be too small a clearance between the two components. If the load is less than the minimum of the range, there will be a large clearance between the two components. In each of these conditions, a red light on  the electric control panel<br>
-6-<br>
would indicate rejection, followed by a beep sound. When the load used for pressing is within the range, then the components are correct, and a green light appears on the electric control panel. Further, when either of the components is rejected, the pressing action of the hydraulic cylinder stops, and the piston rod retracts, on command from the electric control panel.<br>
CPU 9  is  provided at  the  top of the press  and  is connected to load cell 13, LVDT 14, motor of the pump 7' and solenoids for travelling the hydraulic  cylinder up and down. The CPU receives input signals from -i)   Load cell to detect the load; ii)  LVDT to detect the position; iii) Solenoid for travelling the cylinder up; iv)  Solenoid for travelling the cylinder down; and v)   Electric motor connection to start the power pack.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the system block schematically. It shows a display unit 15 having digital outputs 16, digital inputs 17, Analogue Inputs 18 and power supply port 19. The display unit is connected to control panel 9. On the control panel are shown Power Supplies 20, LVDT Signal Conditioner 21, and Load cell signal conditioner 22. LVDT Signal Conditioner 21 is connected to LVDT 14 while load cell signal conditioner 22 is connected to load cell 13. An output card 23 and an input card 23' on the control panel is connected to an Up Solenoid S1 and to a Down solenoid S2. Motor 24 for operating the hydraulic  power pack  is  connected to  the<br>
-7-<br>
control panel and is connected through a contactor 25, fuses 26 and isolator 27 to a 3-phase power supply 28. Start and stop switches SW1, SW2 are provided on the control panel for operating the motor 24. Upper and lower limit stop switches LS1, LS2 are provided on the hydraulic cylinder, and are actuable at the extreme positions by the ram. The limit stop switches are connected to the solenoids.<br>
When the motor 24 is started . by actuating the start switch, the hydraulic power pack is actuated. Fuses and isolator protect the apparatus against excess or overload of power. As the ram 6' (Fig. 4) moves down, LVDT 14 senses the signal continuously and LVDT signal conditioner 21 monitors the movement. The change in position is displayed on the display unit 15 also, by means of the digital inputs and outputs 16 and 17. The load cell 13 senses the load and transmits signal to the load cell signal conditioner 22 for display on the display unit 15.<br>
When the ram 6' comes to extreme positions either by touching the upper or lower limit switch (LS1, LS2), or a load cell preset value position, up solenoid S1 and down solenoid S2 sense the position and control the position of the ram by controlling oil flow to the hydraulic cylinder.<br>
The load cell 13 detects the load applied. The LVDT 14 detects the position of travel. When the components are not pressed into each other, there is zero load. If the pressing is started then load cell indicates it. The position at which load is applied is sensed by LVDT.  From there onwards,<br>
-8-<br>
till the depth to which jpressing is continued, load cell senses the load and detects whether the component is rejected or accepted.<br>
When the cylinder 6 moves down and applies force, the load cell 13 senses what load is applied. The LVDT 14 senses the position and the load applied. The components 1 and 2 are pressed into each other by friction. If the load applied at position of inserting the components into each other after inserting the components is within the set range, the component is accepted.  Otherwise it is rejected.<br>
If the dimension is more in hole than in shaft, there is less force in turn-load required to press the component. If this load is not within the range required, the load cell senses and the cylinder returns back to the normal position i.e., upper position, on receipt of signal from the CPU to the motor.<br>
If the dimension is more in shaft than in hole, then there is more force in turn-load required to press the component. If this load is not within the range required, the load cell senses and the cylinder returns back to the normal position i.e., upper position on receipt of signal from the CPU to the motor.<br>
If the components are within the tolerance limit and the force in turn-load required to press each other is within the tolerance range, the pressing continues till the operation is completed and the cylinder returns back to the original position i.e., upper position.<br>
