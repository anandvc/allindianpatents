				<td>MACROMER FORMING CATALYSTS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the use of macromer-forming catalysts in the formation of<br>
macromers, especially the macromers used to make ophthalmic lenses.<br>
Ophthalmic lenses such as contact lenses are often made in polymerization<br>
processes which employ initiators. Acylphosphine oxides are a useful class of<br>
initiators for free radical polymerizations, of the type frequently used to make<br>
ophthalmic lenses. Bisacylphosphine oxides and their use are described in US<br>
Patent No. 5,534,559 incorporated herein by reference. All of the patents and patent<br>
applications listed herein are incorporated by reference. Unfortunately, the prior art<br>
macromer-forming catalysts which are used in the preparation of the macromers,<br>
which are used to make ophthalmic lenses, often adversely effect the stability of<br>
these initiators and the use shelf life of the multicomponent formulations' which<br>
contain them.<br>
It is often desirable to prepare a mixture of materials together with one or more<br>
macromers, one or more initiators and other additives that will ultimately form the<br>
lens upon completion of curing. These types of mixes are referred to as the<br>
"monomer mix" in this specification.<br>
Stability of the initiator can effect the shelf life of the monomer mix. Increasing the<br>
"shelf life" or stability of the monomer mix from that seen in the prior art is<br><br>
desirable since it reduces the need to frequently prepare monomer mix lots (as<br>
described below) and the possibility of introducing lot to lot and intra-lot variations<br>
in lens production.<br>
Unfortunately, in the prior art initiators tend to be unstable in a variety of<br>
environments lessening their potential. EP 849,296 proposed a method of<br>
stabilizing bisacylphosphine oxide initiators used in the production of urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate polymers used for optical fiber coatings. The method involves<br>
preparing a urethane (meth)acrylate oligomer using a tertiary amine catalyst and<br>
then mixing with the photoinitiator and other coating formulation components.<br>
There are also similar methods in the prior art of stabilizing monoacylphosphine<br>
oxide photoinitiators in the presence of a tin compound used as a macromer-forming<br>
catalyst in the urethane (meth)acrylate oligomer synthesis. U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 01/09076 teaches the use of tin catalysts with acetic acid.<br>
Unfortunately, a tin catalyst such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) is not desirable<br>
when applied to monomer mixes used to make ophthalmic lenses because of the<br>
potentially deleterious effect it has on the photoinitiator and may have on various<br>
other components of the monomer mix. This is particularly true where the<br>
monomer mix is used to make silicone hydrogel lenses.<br>
The prior art teaches the use of Lewis acid catalysts, including, but not limited to,<br>
tin catalysts, such as DBTDL for the formation of macromers. The decrease in<br>
initiator (especially photoinitiator, particularly bis-(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-(2,4,4-<br><br>
trimethylpentyl) phosphine oxide (DMBAPO)) concentration after mixing into a<br>
monomer mix results in the production of lenses having unacceptable parameters<br>
and physical attributes. Therefore, a new type of macromer-forming catalysts,<br>
which does not effect initiator concentration, is desirable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention involves the use of macromer-forming catalysts, which<br>
catalyze the attachment of reactive polymerizable groups to a macromer, from<br>
electrophilic compounds and macromer-precursor materials, ("Macromer-forming<br>
Catalysts"), and which include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines, preferably<br>
triethylamine ("TEA"), and bismuth catalysts, preferably bismuth carboxylates,<br>
more preferably bismuth (111) 2-ethylhexanoate, in the macromer synthesis used in<br>
the making of ophthalmic lenses. In one embodiment, the present invention relates<br>
to composition of matter comprising:a macromer formed from an electrophilic<br>
compound and a macromer-precursor material in the presence of a macromer-<br>
forming catalyst; combined with a visible light photoinitiator, wherein the<br>
macromer-forming catalyst is compatible with the photoinitiator.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Brief Description Of The AccornpanyingDrawing	<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the change in enthalpy of photopolymerization with<br>
aging for three different monomer mixes, one with a triethylamine ("TEA")<br>
catalyzed macromer, one with a DBTDL catalyzed macromer and one with a K-<br>
KAT 348 bismuth carboxylate catalyzed macromer.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, macromer-forming catalysts are catalysts that catalyze the reaction<br>
(preferably Lewis bases) but are compatible with visible light activated<br>
photoinitiators, such that they do not adversely affect the concentration of the<br>
photoinitiator after mixing into the monomer mix, maintaining a desired shelf life.<br>
The macromer-forming catalysts include, but are not limited to, amines, pyridines,<br>
sodium hydroxides, sulfuric acids, trifluoroacetic acids, bismuth salts and tertiary<br>
amines.<br>
The electrophilic compound has the following structure<br>
RG-LG-PG<br>
where RG comprises a reactive group, which may be selected from the group<br>
comprising electrophilic functional groups including, but not limited to, isocyanate,<br>
acid halide, acid anhydride, ester, epoxide, acetal, aldehyde, alkyl halide (preferably<br>
an activated alkyl halide). LG comprises a divalent linking group, including, but<br>
	*<br>
not limited to, an alkyl, aryl, ester or ether group or a covalent bond. PG comprises<br><br>
a group that can polymerize under .free radical polymerization conditions, including,<br>
but not limited to, a group comprising a vinyl or substituted vinyl group, preferably<br>
activated by an adjoined ester, lactam or aryl group. Examples of the electrophilic<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to, as 3-isopropenyl-,-dimethylbenzyl<br>
isocyanate (TMI), vinylbenzyl chloride, allyl chloride, meth(acryloyl) chloride,<br>
(meth)acrylic anhydride, methyl methacrylate, methacrylamidoacetaldehyde<br>
dimethylacetal, 4-methacrylamidobtityraldehyde diethylacetal, glycidyl(peth)<br>
acrylate, 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate, allyl isocyanate, vinyl isocyanate,<br>
isomeric vinylbenzyl isocyanate or adduct of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)<br>
with 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or isophorone diisocyanate(IPDr), preferably<br>
the 1:1 adduct. Mixtures of the above may also be used.<br>
The macromer-precursor material comprises such reactive groups, including, but not<br>
limited to, hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, diol or thiol groups. The electrophilic<br>
compound covalently bonds at the RG group with the macromer-precursor material,<br>
forming a covalent bond, such as, without limitation, a urethane, urea, ester or ether<br>
group.<br>
The macromer-precursor may also comprise chemical groups that contribute to high<br>
oxygen permeability such as siloxane groups such as polydimethylsiloxane groups,<br>
or polyfluorinated groups. The macromer-precursor may also comprise hydrophilic<br>
groups such as hydroxyls (in excess of those needed to react with the electrophile),<br>
amide or ether groups such as polyethylene oxide groups. Such hydrophilic groups<br><br>
may contribute to the formation of optically clear solutions of silicone and<br>
hydrophilic monomers used in the monomer mix. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
macromer-precursor comprises a combination of silicone and hydroxyl groups, and<br>
thus contributes to both the compatibility of the monomer mix, and the oxygen<br>
permeability of the ultimate ophthalmic lens polymer. The macromer precursor<br>
may have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 2,000,000, more<br>
preferably from about 800 to about 100,000, and most preferably from about 1000<br>
to about 20,000.<br>
One of the major benefits of using the claimed macromer-forming catalysts in the<br>
macromer synthesis is that the initiator subsequently used in the polymerization<br>
process is not adversely affected. Additionally, any of the macromer-forming<br>
catalysts can be adjusted in amount to give acceptable reaction time in the<br>
macromer formation.<br>
The electrophilic compound and macromer-precursor material are exposed to a<br>
macromer-forming catalyst in order to synthesize the macromer. The preferred<br>
macromer-forming catalysts are TEA or bismuth (III) 2-ethylhexanoate.<br>
The amount of macromer-forming catalysts containing bismuth used in the<br>
macromer formation is about 0.02 mole % to about 2.0 mole % macromer-forming<br>
catalysts relative to an electrophilic compound, such as TMI, preferably about 0.05<br>
mole % to about 1.0 mole %, most preferably about 0.05 mole % to about 0.2 mole<br>
%. Electrophilic compounds include monoisocyanates, diisocyanates and<br><br>
compounds with greater than 2 isocyanate groups, preferably a compound with at<br>
least one isocyanate group and one polymerizable double bond, more preferably 2-<br>
isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (DEM), most preferably TMI.<br>
The amount of TEA used in the macromer formation is preferably about 0.1 mole %<br>
to about 2.0 mole % relative to an electrophilic compound such as TMI, more<br>
preferably about 1.32 mole % relative to TMI.<br>
A macromer in the present invention is a product produced by the reaction of an<br>
electrophilic compound and a macromer-precursor material in the presence of a<br>
macromer-forming catalyst. A preferred LG group comprises a urethane linkage.<br>
The urethane linkages in the macromer are formed as follows:<br>
R1NCO + R2OH —&gt; R1NHCOOR2<br>
The macromer includes, but is not limited to, the following types of macromers:<br>
linear ,-terrninated hydroxyl functional polymers, linear ,-terminated amino<br>
functional polymers, linear a,co-terminated carboxylic acid functional polymers,<br>
linear hydroxyl, amino, or carboxylic acid monofunctional polymers, hydroxyl,<br>
amino, or carboxylic acid terminated star polymer (3-8 arms), pendant hydroxyl<br>
functional polymers, pendant amino functional polymers, pendant carboxylic acid<br>
functional polymers, any combination of pendant and chain terminated hydroxyl,<br>
amino, or carboxylic acid functional polymers listed above.<br><br><br>
The present invention involves a method of preparing macromer by reacting an<br>
electrophilic compound and a macromer-precursor material in the presence of a<br>
macromer-forming catalyst, for a reaction between the electrophilic compound and<br>
the macromer-precursor material, preferably a condensation reaction. The<br>
macromer-precursor material means a compound with at least one group capable of<br>
reacting with an electrophilic compound and forming a condensation product, such<br>
as urethane, ("reacting groups"), including, but not limited to, compounds with at<br>
least one hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, or thiol group. Preferred macromer-precursor<br>
materials comprise hydroxyls and more preferred macromer-precursor materials are<br>
comprised of or made from 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate,<br>
hydroxypropyl methacrylate, ethoxylatedhydroxyethyl methacrylate, polypropylene<br>
glycol monomethacrylate, caprolactone acrylate, beta carboxyethyl acrylate,<br>
hydroxyethyl vinyl ether, N-(2-hydroxyethyl) methacrylamide, 3,4-dihydroxybutyl<br>
methacrylate, N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide, N-hydroxymethyl methacrylamide, (3-<br>
methacryloxy-2-hydroxypropyloxy)propylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane<br>
(SiGMA), acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, HEMA, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
(PVA), glycerylmonomethacrylate, methyldi(trimethylsiloxy)sylylpropylglycerol<br>
methacrylate, dextran, 2-hydroxyethylcellulose, and hydroxyrnethylcellulose,<br>
mixtures thereof and polymers and copolymers thereof. Preferred macromer-<br>
precursor materials comprise silicone. The macromer-precursor material may be<br>
prepared as known in the prior art, preferably by group transfer polymerization,<br><br>
such as those described in US Patent Nos. 5,244,981; 5,331,067; 5,314,960;<br>
5,314,961; and 5,371,147.<br>
Additionally, the present invention involves a macromer-forming composition<br>
comprising an electrophilic compound and a macromer-precursor material, and a<br>
macromer-forming catalyst. The macromer-forming reaction preferably takes place<br>
substantially at one or more terminal reacting groups on the macromer-precursor<br>
material and also at one or more pendant groups. Terminal reacting groups mean<br>
reacting groups which are placed at the end of any chain, as distinct from pendant<br>
groups located on a chain at positions other than either end. The macrorner may be<br>
used in multicomponent formulations used to make medical devices such as<br>
ophthalmic lenses, which may be made of silicone hydrogels.<br>
Silicone hydrogels have high oxygen permeability making them particularly<br>
desirable for use in ophthalmic lenses. Silicone hydrogels are preferably prepared<br>
by polymerizing a mixture containing at least one silicone-containing monomer and<br>
at least one hydrophilic monomer. Either the silicone-containing monomer or the<br>
hydrophilic monomer may function as a crosslinking agent or a separate crosshnker<br>
may be employed. Crosslinking agents are monomers having multiple<br>
polymerizable moieties. The term "monomer mix" when used in this sense refers to<br>
a material used in forming the ultimate polymeric ophthalmic lens system. The<br>
crosslinking agent may have repeat chain units and still be considered a monomer.<br>
Incorporating a crosslinking agent into the monomer mix may generate a cross-<br><br>
linked network. There are numerous silicone-containing monomelic units<br>
commonly used in the formation of silicone hydrogels. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,808,178;<br>
4,120,570; 4,136,250; 4,139,513; 4,139,692; 4,153,641; 4,740,533; 5,034,461;<br>

Hydrophilic monomers that have previously been found useful for making silicone<br>
hydrogels include, but are not limited to: unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as<br>
methacrylic and acrylic acids; acrylic substituted alcohols, such as 2-<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate and 2-hydroxyethylacrylate; vinyl lactams, such as N-<br>

In the present invention, the macromer is the reaction product of an electrophilic<br>
compound and a macromer-precursor material in the presence of a macromer-<br>
forming catalyst. The macromer-forming catalysts include, but are not limited to,<br>
tertiary amines and bismuth catalysts.<br>

carbonate (BiO)2CO3. Bismuth carboxylates preferably have a carboxylate portion<br>
comprising a C2-C30, saturated or unsaturated carboxyl terminated hydrocarbon or<br>
inertly substituted hydrocarbon chain. By inertly substituted, it is meant that the<br>
hydrocarbon chain contains no substituent group which undesirably effects the<br>
catalytic behavior of the macromer-forming catalyst. Preferably the carboxylate<br>
portion is from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms. Suitable carboxylate groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, the ions of fatty acids, as well as branched<br>
carboxylates such as neodecanoic acid, and Versatic 911 Acid. Preferred bismuth<br>
catalysts include bismuth(IH) 2-ethylhexanoate (75-79%), CAS#: [67874-71-9],<br><br><br>
which is produced by King Industries, and compositions containing bismuth<br>
carboxylates. These bismuth catalysts can be used singly or as a mixture of two or<br>
more components. When bismuth catalysts are used, the time for the reaction<br>
between the electrophilic compound and the macromer-precursor material is about 3<br>
hours.<br>

atom in a molecule including, but not limited to, aliphatic amines (including, but not<br>
limited to, tri-C1-6alkylamine such as TEA and tributylamine, 13-<br>

catalysts are used, the time for the reaction between the monoisocyanate and the<br>
macromer-precursor material is about 24 to about 72 hours.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a macromer comprises the reaction product of a<br>
protected HEMA, including, but not limited to, 2-(trimethylsiloxy) ethyl<br>
methacrylate (TMS-HEMA); methylmethacrylate (MMA); TRIS; mPDMS; and<br>

The electrophilic compound and macromer-precursor material are exposed to a<br>
macromer-forming catalyst in order to synthesize the macromer. The condensation<br>
reaction of the electrophilic compound and the macromer-precursor material is<br>
catalyzed by the macromer-forming catalyst. When the electrophilic compound is<br>
an isocyanate, and the reactive groups on the monomer-precursor are hydroxyls, the<br>
basic reaction is conducted in the presence of a macromer-forming catalyst as<br>
follows:<br>
R1NCO + R2OH —&gt; R1NHCOOR2<br><br>
The preferred macromer-forming catalysts are tertiary amines or bismuth catalysts,<br>
most preferably TEA or bismuth (III) 2-ethylhexanoate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the TEA catalyst is introduced in liquid form to the<br>
electrophilic compound and macromer-precursor material, which react to form the<br>
macromer.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the bismuth catalyst is introduced in liquid form<br>
to the electrophilic compound and macromer-precursor material which react to form<br>
the macromer.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the macromer-forming catalyst is present with the<br>
reactants perfluoropolyether Fombline ® ZDOL (from Ausimont S.p.A. Milan),<br>
isophorone diisocyanate, ,-hydroxypropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane KF-<br>
6001 from Shin-Etsu and 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate. The resultant macromer<br>
is used to produce contact lenses by subsequently reacting the macromer, TRIS and<br>
DMA with an initiator. The resultant macromer and subsequent reaction is similar<br>
to that disclosed in Examples Bl and B5 of U.S. Patent No. 5,760,100 except that in<br>
the present invention, TEA or bismuth catalyst is used instead of DBTDL and<br>
different initiators may be used.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the bismuth catalyst is present with the reactants,<br>
a polyvinyl alcohol and an isocyanate, which react to form a polyvinyl alcohol<br><br>
derivative macromer. The polyvinyl alcohol derivative macromer, preferably<br>
having at least about 2000 number molecular weight, include, but are not limited to,<br><br><br><br><br>
The isocyanate has the following formula:<br><br>
The polyvinyl alcohol derivative macromer is reacted in a subsequent reaction to<br>
produce ophthalmic lens material. The polyvinyl alcohol derivative macromer and<br>
subsequent reaction is similar to that disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,665,123; 4,<br>
978,713; 4,720,187; and 4,670,506, except that in the present invention, bismuth<br>
catalyst is used and different initiators may be used in the subsequent reaction.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the macromer-forrning catalyst is removed from<br>
the reaction product produced by the electrophilic compound and the macromer-<br>
precursor material. The removal of the macromer-forrning catalyst may be effected<br>
by purification techniques, including, but not limited to, extraction, crystallization,<br>
precipitation, distillation, evaporation, and other purification methods. The removal<br>
of the macromer-forrning catalyst may occur before, during or after the addition of<br>
an initiator to the reaction product produced by the electrophilic compound and the<br>
macromer-precursor material. In a preferred embodiment, the macromer-forrning<br>
catalyst is removed prior to the addition of the initiator. In the prior art, DBTDL<br>
catalyzed macromer contains about 15 to about 105 ppm tin, following macromer<br>
synthesis and purification. In comparison, the present invention of bismuth<br><br>
catalyzed macromer contains less than about 9 ppm bismuth, following macromer<br>
synthesis and purification.<br>
The macromers may then be used in medical devices, such as ophthalmic lenses.<br>
The process of making ophthalmic lenses proceeds by combining the components of<br>
a monomer mix together with the initiators and stabilizers described herein<br>
according to well known methods of lens formation such as photoinitiated casting in<br>
lens molds.<br>
The preferred components of the monomer mix used to make the silicone hydrogel<br>

monomer mix before the mix is placed in a lens mold for lens production), and<br>
optionally additional monomers. In certain embodiments, the monomer mix further<br>
comprises at least one ultraviolet absorbing compound. Suitable ultraviolet<br>

present and include, but are not limited to, stabilizers, reactive dyes, organic and<br>
inorganic pigments, dyes, photochromic compounds, release agents, antimicrobial<br>

divinylbenzene. In a preferred embodiment, the siloxane component is a<br><br>
polydimethyl siloxane. It is combined with a hydrophilic monomer such as DMA,<br>
N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), hydroxyethyl methacrylate or acrylate derivative.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the monomers comprise mPDMS such as<br>
monomethacryloxypropyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane and a macromer<br>
comprising the reaction product of HEMA, MMA, TRIS, mPDMS and TMI.<br>
Additionally preferred monomers include, but are not limited to, TRIS; DMA; and<br>
TEGDMA. Other monomers and crosslinking agents known in the art for making<br>
silicone hydrogels can also be used.<br>
Suitable photoinitiators for use in the present invention are those which are activated<br>
by exposure to visible light. The photoinitiators of this invention are those having<br>
the following structure:<br>
Structure I<br><br><br>

hydroxy or C1-4 alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, or alkynyl group. Substitution with hetero<br>
atoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and halo atoms is possible but is not favored.<br>
It is preferred that R1 and R2 are both Structure II moieties with R4 and R8<br>
substituents. It is most preferred that R4 and R8 are methoxy groups. It is further<br>

The following examples compare the ophthalmic lenses prepared from the present<br>
invention to those prepared according to the prior art. Notably, the lenses prepared<br>
according to the present invention are acceptable for use and are equivalent to the<br>
reference lenses.<br>
Example 1<br>
The following is an example of the present invention's macromer synthesis.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br>
TMS-HEMA, MMA, mPDMS (about 800 to about 1000MW), TRIS, p-xylene and<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried over preactivated 4A molecular sieve, and THF,<br>
mPDMS, and TRIS were passed through aluminum oxide column before use.<br>
To a dry container in a dry box under nitrogen was added bis(dimethylamino)-<br>
methylsilane, a 1M solution of tetrabutylammonium 3-chlorobenzoate (TBACB) in<br>
THF, p-xylene, MMA (1.4 eqv. relative to initiator), TMS-HEMA (8.5 eqv. relative<br><br>
to photoinitiator) and THF. The above mixture was charged to a dry flask equipped<br>
with a thermocouple and a condenser connected to a nitrogen source.<br>
To the reaction mixture was injected methyltrimethylsilyl dimethylketene acetal<br>
while stirring and purging with nitrogen. The reaction was allowed to exotherm to<br>
about 65°C and then after the temperature of the solution dropped, a solution of<br>
TBACB in dry THF (0.4 M) was fed in slowly throughout the rest of the reaction.<br>
Then in step 2, a mixture of TMS-HEMA (2.1 eqv. to initiator), mPDMS (3.3 eqv.<br>
to initiator), TRIS (7.9 eqv. to initiator) and bis(dimethylamino)-methylsilane,<br>
prepared in dry box, was added under nitrogen.<br>
The reaction mixture was again allowed to exotherm to approximately 42°C and<br>
then allowed to cool to 32°C. The solution was stirred at 32°C by using a<br>
temperature controller and heating equipment for about five hours. In step 3, a<br>
mixture on of TMS-HEMA (8.5 eqv. to initiator), MMA (1.4 eqv. relative to<br>
initiator) and bis(dimethylamino)-methylsilane was added and the whole mixture<br>
allowed to exotherm to 46 - 49°C. After the mixture reacted about two hours, 270 g<br>
of THF was added to reduce the viscosity and the solution was stirred for additional<br>
30 minutes.<br>
In step 4, a mixture of water, methanol and dichloroacetic acid was addqd and the<br>
mixture was refluxed for five hours to de-block the protecting groups. The solvents<br>
were then removed by distillation and toluene was added to aid in removal of<br>
residual water until a vapor temperature reached 110°C<br><br>
A solution of TMI and 0.2 mole % bismuth catalyst K-KAT 348 relative to TMI<br>
was added to the above solution in toluene. The whole mixture was stirred at 1100C<br>
for three hours and the disappearance of the isocyanate peak was monitored by IR.<br>
The toluene was removed under reduced pressure at around 45°C to give a raw<br>
macromer.<br>
Purification procedures were employed to remove high molecular weight species.<br>
The raw macromer was re-dissolved in acetone (2:1 w / w acetone to macromer) and<br>
the acetone solution was set overnight to allow high molecular weight species to<br>
separate. The top clear phase was filtered through a PTFE membrane by pressure<br>
filtration. The filtrate was slowly charged into water (4:1 v / v water to filtrate) and<br>
the macromer was precipitated out. The macromer was collected and dried using a<br>
vacuum oven at 45 - 65°C under reduced pressure until there was no weight change.<br>
Further purification to remove low molecular weight species was also ddne by re-<br>
precipitation of the macromer from the mixture of acetone and acetonitrile (1:5 v /<br>
v).<br>
Example 2<br>
A bismuth catalyst and a TEA catalyst were each separately used to synthesize the<br>
macromer (as described in Example 1), which was later used to make ophthalmic<br>
lenses. The lenses were made via direct molding, using a closed mold under<br>
conventional molding conditions. These lenses were compared.<br><br>
The lenses were optically clear. The bismuth catalyst macromer has at least a 10-<br>
week shelf-life at 55°C. The TEA catalyzed macromer has at least a 30-week shelf-<br>
life at 55°C.<br>
The results of this study are noted in the table below.<br>
Table 2<br>
Standard deviations are noted in the parentheses.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Another study compared the ophthalmic lenses made using TEA catalyst and<br>
DBTDL catalyst in the macromer formation described in Example 1. The DBTDL<br>
catalyzed macromer also uses acetic acid in the formation process as described in<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 01/09076. The elastic modulus values for lenses<br>
from DBTDL-catalyzed macromer were comparable to the modulus for lenses from<br>
TEA-catalyzed monomer, but the DBTDL-catalyzed macromer lenses were<br><br>
unacceptable to wear because they were misshapen and had torn or jagged edges-<br>
Acceptable modulus values are about 30 to about 200 psi, more preferably about 35<br>
to about 150 psi, and most preferably about 38 to about 100 psi. Water content<br>
values and Dk [units = x 10-9 (cm/sec)(mL (VmL x mm Hg)] values show little or<br>
no dependency on macromer-forming catalyst used in the macromer synthesis.<br>
Table 3 reflects the measurements of relevant characteristics for the average of 8<br>
batches using TEA-catalyzed macromer in monomer mixes and the average of 3<br>
batches using DBTDL-catalyzed macromer in monomer mixes.<br>
Table 3: Modulus. Elongation. Percent Water Content and Dk Values for lenses<br>
made from monomer mixes containing TEA and DBTDL-catalyzed macromer<br>
Standard deviations are noted in the parentheses<br><br>
Example 4<br>
A monomer mix was made from macromer, which was made as described in<br>
Example 1, by combining the following: 17.98 % (wt) macromer from Example 1,<br><br>
28.0%mPDMS (MW 800-1000), 14.0% TRIS, 26.0% DMA, 5.0% HEMA, 1.0%<br>
TEGDMA, 2.0% Norbloc (2-(2'-hydroxy-5-methacrylyloxyethylphenyl)-2H-<br>
benzotriazole), 0.02% Blue HEMA (product of the base-promoted displacement of<br>
one chloride of Reactive Blue # 4 dye by hydroxyethyl methacrylate), 5.0% PVP<br>
(K90), and 1.0% CGI 1850 (1:1 (wt) blend of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone<br><br>
and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide) blended<br>
with the diluent 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol in a ratio of 80 parts (wt) of the blend with<br>
20 parts (wt) diluent.<br>
The enthalpy of photopolymerization was measured using a TA Instruments<br>
differential photocalorimeter with a mercury vapor lamp, with the sample at 70°C<br>
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The enthalpy of photopolymerization was measured<br>
as a function of monomer mix storage time at 55°C. The results are shown in Figure<br>
1, showing monomer mixes made using macromer made using the procedure of<br>
Example 1 with the following macromer-forming catalysts: TEA, DBTDL (with<br>
acetic acid) or K-KAT 348 bismuth carboxylate catalyst. The enthalpy values are<br>
the average of two measurements each.<br>
Enthalpy values for monomer mixes made using TEA or K-KAT 348 are<br>
statistically equivalent and do not exhibit a decrease over time as compared to<br>
monomer mixes made using DBTDL in the prior art. Without being limited to the<br>
mechanism, the degradation of the enthalpy values for the monomer mixes made<br>
using DBTDL represents degradation of the visible-light photoinitiator.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
A monomer mix was made from the following: 17.98 % (wt) macromer from<br>
Example 1 but made with DBTDL in place of K-KAT 348 bismuth carboxylate<br>
catalyst, 28.0% mPDMS (MW 800-1000), 14.0% TRIS, 26.0% DMA, 5.0%<br>
HEMA, 1.0% TEGDMA, 2.0% Norbloc (2-(2'-hydroxy-5-<br>
methacrylyloxyethylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole), 0.02% Blue HEMA (product of the<br>
base-promoted displacement of one chloride of Reactive Blue # 4 dye by<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate), 5.0% PVP (K90), and 1.0% CGI 1850 (1:1 (wt) blend<br>
of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-<br>
trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide) blended with the diluent 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol in<br>
a ratio of 80 parts (wt) of the blend with 20 parts (wt) diluent.<br>
Immediately after this monomer mix was made, contact lenses were made by curing<br>
in plastic molds under irradiation for 30 minutes with visible light fluorescent bulbs<br>
(Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs) at 45°C. The molds were opened and the<br>
lenses were released in 60% IP A in water, then soaked at least one hour each in<br>
100%, 75%, 50% and 25% (v/v) PA in water. The resulting lenses were round and<br><br>
symmetrical, and had smooth optical surfaces.<br>
After storing the monomer mix for four days at 56°C ("aged monomer mix"), a<br>
second set of lenses were made using the same process. These lenses made from<br>
aged monomer mix were asymmetrical, and had rough and unacceptable optical<br>
surfaces.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In contrast, lenses made with the same process from a monomer mix with a bismuth<br>
catalyzed macromer (as described in Example 1) were symmetrical and had smooth<br>
optical surfaces even when made from a monomer mix stored for 4 weeks or longer<br>
at 56°C.<br>
