				<td>Title - Tissue-adhesive materials<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a flexible sheet suitable for use as a tissue adhesive and sealant, and intended for topical application to internal and external surfaces of the body, for therapeutic purposes. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such a sheet, and to methods of using such a sheet. In particular the invention relates to a self-adhesive, biocompatible and hydratable polymeric sheet, which may be used for therapeutic purposes such as wound healing, joining, sealing and reinforcing weakened tissue, and for delivery of therapeutic agents, and to a process for preparing, and methods of using, such a sheet. The invention further relates to implantable medical devices coated with similar material to that of the sheet.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There is considerable interest in the use, for a number of surgical or other therapeutic applications, of materials that adhere to biological tissues, eg as an alternative to the use of mechanical fasteners such as sutures, staples etc. Formulations of such materials that have hitherto been proposed include viscous solutions or gels that are either manufactured in that form or are prepared immediately prior to use by mixing of the ingredients. Such formulations are then applied to the tissue surface using a suitable applicator device such as a syringe.<br>
Formulations of the type described above suffer from a number of disadvantages. If the formulation is of low viscosity, it may spread from the area of application and hence be difficult to apply precisely to the desired area of tissue. If the formulation is more viscous, on the other hand, it may be difficult to dispense. In either case, the formulation, being prepared in hydrated form, may have a limited lifetime and may be subject to premature curing.  It may therefore be necessary for the whole of the formulation to be used at once or discarded. Also, the preparation of<br><br>
formulations immediately prior to use by mixing of ingredients is obviously laborious and time-consuming, and may require the use of additional apparatus. In addition to these drawbacks, the degree of adhesion between tissue surfaces that is provided by such formulations may be less than would be desired.<br>
Formulations of tissue adhesive materials have also been applied to suitable supports for application to the tissue surface. The use of therapeutic materials in the form of a sheet, patch or film, for topical administration to either internal or external organs of the body, is well documented for a wide range of medical applications. A disadvantage of products proposed hitherto, however, is that the degree of adhesion to the underlying tissue in addition to their cohesive strength, particularly in the longer term, may be inadequate. While the initial adhesion may be satisfactory, the sheet may subsequently become detached from the tissue, often after only a few seconds or minutes, eg as a result of hydration of the sheet following its application. In addition, the flexibility of the product may be insufficient for it to conform readily to the surface to which it is applied, which may also have an adverse effect on its adhesion.<br>
As a result of the inadequate adhesion of these products, it may be necessary to provide further reinforcement, eg through mechanical attachment using sutures, staples or the like. Alternatively, energy (eg light or heat energy) may be applied in order to initiate chemical bonding of the adhesive formulation to the underlying tissue, and hence bonding of the tissue surfaces to each other. Clearly, such approaches introduce further drawbacks. The use of mechanical fastenings such as sutures or staples is often the very thing that the use of such products is intended to replace or avoid. In many instances, the use of such fastenings is either not wholly effective (eg on the lung) or undesirable, as their introduction gives rise to further areas of tissue weakness. The use of external energy requires the provision and operation of a source of such energy. Such energy sources may be expensive and difficult to operate, particularly in the confines of an operating theatre or similar environment. Also, the use of external energy for attachment can be both time-consuming and (in some cases) requires significant<br><br>
careful judgement on the part of the surgeon, to evaluate when sufficient energy has been delivered to effect attachment without damaging the underlying tissue.<br>
A disadvantage of sheet-type products for applications as described above is that they may lack the degree of flexibility that may be necessary or desirable for many applications. This is particularly so for products used in the increasingly important field of endoscopic (keyhole) surgery, which may require the product to be folded or rolled into a compact configuration prior to introduction into the body. Attempts to render such products more flexible, eg by the inclusion of plasticisers, may have the effect of reducing the adhesiveness of the product.<br>
There have now been devised improvements to tissue-adhesive sheets or the like of the general type described above, and to related applications of tissue-adhesive material, that overcome or substantially mitigate the above-mentioned and/or other disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a multi-lamellar tissue-adhesive sheet comprising a structural layer or laminate, which structural layer or laminate comprises one or more synthetic polymers having film-forming properties, and to which structural layer or laminate is conjoined a tissue-contacting layer of material containing tissue-reactive groups.<br>
The sheet according to the invention is advantageous primarily in that it bonds effectively to tissue, enabling it to be used in a variety of medical applications. The sheet has been found to offer improved flexibility and yet to retain good adhesiveness. In preferred embodiments, the sheet exhibits good initial adhesion to the tissue to which it is applied (and may thus be described as "self-adhesive"), and furthermore remains well-adhered to the tissue over a longer timescale. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the initial adhesion of the sheet to the tissue is attributable to electronic bonding of the sheet to the<br><br>
tissue, and this is supplemented or replaced by covalent chemical bonding between the tissue-reactive functional groups of the formulation and the tissue, in particular between amine and/or thiol groups on the tissue surface and the tissue-reactive functional groups of the sheet.<br>
Initial adhesion of the sheet to the tissue surface is believed to be due to Van der Waals forces and/or hydrogen bonding between the sheet and the tissue surface. On contact with the tissue surface the sheet becomes hydrated, thereby causing reaction between the tissue-reactive functional groups and the underlying tissue surface. Such reactions between the tissue-reactive functional groups and the underlying tissue result in high adhesion between the sheet and the tissue surface. The sheet may absorb physiological fluids (as a consequence of application onto exuding tissue surfaces), and any additional solutions used to hydrate the sheet following application (such fluids can be commonly used solutions used in surgical irrigation), becoming more compliant and adherent to the tissue surfaces, and thereby providing an adhesive sealant with haemostatic and pneumostatic functions.<br>
The use of the sheet reduces or eliminates the need for additional means of mechanical attachment to the tissue (eg sutures or staples), or the need to provide external energy in the form of heat or light to bring about adherence of the sheet to the underlying tissue. Another advantage of the sheet according to the invention is that it is applied to the tissue as a preformed article, rather than being prepared by mixing of materials immediately prior to use.<br>
In addition, because the sheet is, until hydrated upon and following contact with the tissue surface, essentially inactive, the sheet is not prone to premature reaction and as a result its shelf-life may be considerable, eg more than six months when stored appropriately at room temperature.<br><br>
By the term "sheet" is meant an article with a thickness that is considerably less than its other dimensions. Such an article may alternatively be described as a patch or a film.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the structural layer or laminate is a laminate comprising two or more discrete layers that are conjoined together. In particularly preferred embodiments, the laminate comprises alternating layers of polymer having film-forming properties and material containing reactive functional groups. In general, sheets comprising a structural laminate have been found to perform better, in terms of adhesion to tissue and/or elasticity and/or maintenance of structural integrity, than sheets with a single structural layer.<br>
In such a case, the sheet according to the invention most preferably comprises an even number of layers, and in particular alternating layers of film-forming polymer and material containing reactive groups. The sheet may then be considered to comprises a structural laminate comprising n layers of film-forming polymer with n-1 layers of reactive material interspersed therebetween, and a tissue-contacting layer of tissue-reactive material. The value of n may be 1, in which case the sheet comprises simply a single structural layer and the tissue-contacting layer. Alternatively, n may be 2 or 3, in which case the sheet comprises 4 or 6 layers in total. Sheets in which n=2 are currently most preferred.<br>
The material containing reactive functional groups may be the same as, or similar to, the tissue-reactive material of the tissue-contacting layer.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a device suitable for implantation in the human or animal body, which device carries on at least part of the external surface thereof a coating comprising one or more polymers with film-forming properties, at least part of said coating being conjoined to a layer of material comprising tissue-reactive functional groups.<br><br>
In this aspect of the invention, the coating of film-forming polymer provides a means for attachment to the device of the material comprising tissue-reactive functional groups, the latter material providing a means for anchoring the device in its desired position within the body. This aspect of the invention may therefore be of particular utility in relation to implantable devices that would otherwise be difficult to fix in position within the body, for instance because they are made of a material that is chemically inert and not amenable to reaction with the surrounding tissue or with chemical linking groups.<br>
In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made primarily to embodiments of the invention that have the form of sheets. It will be appreciated, however, that analogous comments apply, where appropriate, to embodiments of the invention involving coatings on implantable devices.<br>
In another aspect, the invention also provides a method of joining a tissue surface to another tissue, or of sealing a tissue surface, which method comprises applying to the tissue surface a sheet according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The sheet according to the invention may also be used for the delivery of one or more therapeutically active or anti-infective agents to the site to which the sheet is applied. In such a case, the agent(s) may be incorporated into the sheet, eg by admixture with the other ingredients that are used in the manufacture of the sheet. Alternatively, the agent(s) may be covalently bound to a component of the sheet. However, in other embodiments, the sheet is free of therapeutically active agents. In a similar manner, one or more therapeutically active agents may be incorporated into the material applied to the external surface of an implantable device according to the second aspect of the invention.<br><br>

acid NHS ester<br>
Nature of the structural layer or laminate<br>
The sheet according to the first aspect of the invention includes a structural layer or laminate that comprises at least one film-forming polymer. The structural layer<br>
or laminate may consist entirely or substantially entirely of film-forming polymer. In other embodiments, the structural layer or laminate consists largely of film-forming polymer. For instance, the structural layer or laminate may comprise more than 80%, more than 90% or more than 95% w/w of film-forming polymer.<br>
A variety of suitable film-forming polymers may be used to form the first layer, provided that they exhibit suitable film-forming properties together with suitability for medical applications, in particular absence of toxicity, biocompatibility and, usually, biodegradability.<br>
Most commonly, the first layer comprises just one film-forming polymer. Alternatively, the first layer may be formed from more than one film-forming polymer<br>
The film-forming polymer may be synthetic, or it may be, or may be derived from, a naturally-occurring material.<br>
A particularly preferred group of synthetic polymers that may be suitable for use in the invention are biodegradable polyesters. Specific examples of such polymers are polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid, and copolymers and blends thereof. Other examples include polycaprolactones and polyhydroxyalkanoates, such as polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxyvalerate and polyhydroxyhexanoate.<br>
The currently most preferred polyester polymers for use in the invention are poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [also referred to as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)] copolymers, which are generally biodegradable and biocompatible, and are soluble in a wide range of organic solvents.<br>
in the currently most preferred embodiments of the sheet, comprising a structural laminate, particularly preferred embodiments are those that comprise alternating layers of biodegradable polyester material and material containing reactive functional groups. Thus, in a specific aspect of the invention, there is provided a<br>
multi-lamellar tissue-adhesive sheet comprising a structural laminate, which laminate comprises n layers of a biodegradable polyester with n-1 layers of material containing reactive functional groups interspersed therebetween, and a tissue-contacting layer of tissue-reactive material, wherein n has a value of 1, 2 or 3, most preferably 2.<br>
In such embodiments, the layer distal to the tissue-contacting layer is of polyester, which is substantially non-adhesive to tissue. Such sheets will therefore generally adhere only to the target tissue (to which the tissue-contacting layer, containing tissue-reactive functional groups, is applied), and not to surrounding tissues (eg the pleural or peritoneal wall).<br>
Other examples of synthetic polymers that may be suitable are aminated polymers such as aminated PEGs (including those sold under the trade name JEFFAMINE) and polyallylamines.<br>
Further film-forming polymers that may be suitable for use in the invention are polysaccharides, and in particular basic polysaccharides.<br>
Nature of the tissue-contacting layer<br>
The sheet according to the first aspect of the invention has a tissue-contacting layer that comprises a material containing tissue-reactive functional groups. That material preferably comprises one or more polymers containing tissue-reactive functional groups.<br>
By "tissue-reactive functional groups" is meant functional groups capable of reacting with other functional groups present in the tissue surface so as to form covalent bonds with the tissue. Tissues generally consist partly of proteins, which commonly contain thiol and primary amine moieties. Many functional groups such as imido ester, p-nitrophenyl carbonate, NHS ester, epoxide, isocyanate, acrylate, vinyl sulfone, orthopyridyl-disulfide, maleimide, aldehyde, iodoacetamide, and<br>
others, may react with thiols or primary amines, and therefore constitute "tissue-reactive functional groups". As used herein, the term NHS or NHS ester is intended to encompass not only N-hydroxysuccinimide itself, but also derivatives thereof in which the succinimidyl ring is substituted. An example of such a derivative is N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl and salts thereof, particularly the sodium salt, which may increase the solubility of the tissue-reactive material.<br>
Tissue-reactive functional groups that may be of utility in the present invention are any functional groups capable of reaction (under the conditions prevalent when the formulation is applied to tissue, ie in an aqueous environment and without the application of significant amounts of heat or other external energy) with functional groups present at the surface of the tissue. The latter class of functional group includes thiol and amine groups, and tissue-reactive functional groups therefore include groups reactive to thiol and/or amine groups. Examples are:<br>
imido ester;<br>
p-nitrophenyl carbonate;<br>
NHS ester;<br>
epoxide;<br>
isocyanate;<br>
acrylate;<br>
vinyl sulfone;<br>
orthopyridyl-disulfide;<br>
maleimide;<br>
aldehyde; and<br>
iodoacetamide.<br>
NHS ester is a particularly preferred tissue-reactive functional group.<br>
In addition to tissue-reactive functional groups, the polymer(s) that make up the material of the second layer may contain functional groups that, whilst not themselves being reactive to the tissue to which the sheet is applied, do provide good contact adhesion between the sheet and the tissue. Such functional groups<br>
are referred to herein as "non-reactive functional groups". Examples of non-reactive functional groups include hydroxy!, heterocyclic amines or amides (eg in vinyl pyrrolidone residues) and, particularly, carboxyl groups (eg in acrylic acid residues).<br>
It is particularly preferred that the tissue-reactive functional groups are activated derivatives of non-reactive functional groups. In certain embodiments, all of the non-reactive functional groups may be activated to form tissue-reactive functional groups. In other embodiments, only some of the non-reactive functional groups may be activated to form tissue-reactive functional groups. In the latter case, the strength of initial contact adhesion of the sheet to the tissue to which it is applied, and the strength of the longer term adhesion brought about by covalent reaction of the tissue-reactive functional groups with functional groups in the tissue may be varied and controlled by varying the proportion of the non-reactive groups that are in activated form.<br>
NHS ester is a particularly preferred tissue-reactive functional group, and therefore preferred tissue-reactive polymers are NHS ester-rich polymers. Particularly preferred tissue-reactive polymers are poly(VP-AAc(NHS)) and poly(VP-AAc-AAc(NHS)) terpolymer.<br>
Sufficiency of the degree of initial adhesion of a sheet to the tissue, by the bioadhesive polymer(s), can be quantitatively determined in vitro, for example by performing an adhesion strength test. This test is performed by allowing the sheet to adhere to a suitable substrate (secured in a fixed position), while the sheet itself is physically attached at a separate point to the load of a tensile testing apparatus, positioned so that, prior to the test, the sheet is not under load. The load cell is moveable along an axis substantially perpendicular to that along which the substrate is positioned. The test involves movement of the load cell away from the substrate, at a constant predetermined rate, until the sheet detaches from the substrate. The output of the test is a quantitative measure of the energy of adhesion for that sheet - ie the cumulative amount of energy required to break the<br><br>
interaction between the sheet and the substrate to which it is adhered. A suitable cumulative energy of adhesion for the sheet according to the invention would be not less than 0.5mJ.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, a preferred tissue-reactive polymer is poly(VP-AAc-AAc(NHS)) terpolymer. The carboxyl groups on poly(VP-AAc) may be converted to NHS esters by reaction with NHS in the presence of DCC (see Example 9). If the acid content of the poly(VP-AAc) is determined (in moles), the proportion of acid groups converted to tissue-reactive groups may be controlled by adding the desired mole percent of NHS.<br>
Another tissue-reactive polymer that may be used, containing hydroxyl groups, is an activated form of HPC succinate, eg HPC succinate-NHS. In this case, some of the hydroxyl groups are activated with NHS via succinic acid linkage (see Example 11).<br>
The properties of the tissue-adhesive sheet may be optimised by inclusion of other polymers and additives.<br>
Property Enhancing Additives<br>
Although in general the sheet according to the first aspect of the invention has adequate flexibility, it may nonetheless be desirable to further improve the flexibility, elasticity and/or wet-strength of the sheet by the addition of one or more plasticizers and elastomers to the structural layer or laminate and/or the tissue-contacting layer. In particular, low molecular weight species such as glycerol and low molecular weight PEG may be incorporated into the formulations to increase flexibility. Examples of suitable elastomers that may be incorporated into the product include poly(caprolactones), poly(urethanes) and poly(silicones). Such materials may increase the flexibility and/or elasticity of the sheet when added at levels of up to 30% by weight of the ingredients that make up the sheet.<br>
However, the inclusion of high levels of such materials may have a detrimental effect on the adhesive performance of the sheet. To offset this disadvantage, additives may be functionalised to include tissue-reactive functional groups that may participate in tissue-adhesion.<br>
Buffers<br>
The reaction between tissue-reactive functional groups on the sheet and functional groups on the surface of the tissue may vary with pH. It may therefore be preferable to buffer the tissue surface immediately prior to application or, more preferably, to include a buffer in the formulation used to prepare the sheet, in particular the tissue-contacting layer of the sheet. The mean work of adhesion of certain sheets according to the invention to explanted porcine liver may be improved by buffering the tissue surface with pH 10.5 phosphate/carbonate buffer.<br>
Conjoining of components of the sheet during manufacture<br>
The materials of the structural layer or laminate and/or the tissue-contacting layer may be conjoined during the process of manufacture. Such conjoining may increase the physical strength of the sheet and may optimise the properties of the sheet, in particular in terms of the time required for biodegradation of the sheet after it has been applied.<br>
Conjoining may be brought about by various means, including casting of component layers from common solvents. A further method involves a formulation from which the structural layer or laminate and/or tissue-contacting layer is prepared that comprises at least two functional groups which are capable of reacting with functional groups present in the material that is to be conjoined. This component will therefore act as a cross-linking agent. Preferably, the cross-iinking agent contains at least two functional groups of the same form. Thus, the cross-linking agent is most preferably a homobifunctional or homopolyfunctional cross-linking agent.<br>
Physical form of the sheet<br>
The sheet may typically have an overall thickness of from 0.01 to 1 mm, typically 0.01 to 0.5mm, and more commonly 0.015 to 0.2 mm or 0.015 to 0.1mm, eg 0.015 to 0.05mm.<br>
In currently preferred embodiments, the thickness of the tissue-contacting layer is greater than the thickness of the structural layer or laminate. For instance, the tissue-contacting layer may have a thickness that accounts for more than 50% of the overall thickness of the sheet, or more than 60%.<br>
The sheet may be produced with, or subsequently cut to, dimensions of from a few square millimetres up to several tens of square centimetres.<br>
Manufacture of the sheet<br>
Most conveniently, the sheet according to the invention may be prepared by stepwise formation of the individual layers that make up the sheet.<br>
The structural layer or (as is preferred) the layer of the structural laminate that is distal to the tissue-contacting layer may be prepared first, eg by casting a solution of the material that makes up that layer in a suitable solvent, either on a suitable plate or mould or onto a suitable release paper, eg a silicone-coated release paper. The cast solution is then dried or allowed to dry, optionally under conditions of elevated temperature and/or reduced pressure.<br>
Successive layers of the structural laminate may then be cast onto the pre-formed first layer, followed in each case by drying to remove solvent, and where appropriate curing to achieve a desired degree of cross-linking. Curing is most preferably promoted by application of elevated temperatures (typically up to one hour or more at temperatures of up to 60°C or higher).<br>
Finally, the tissue-contacting layer may be cast onto the structural layer or laminate. Once again, this is preferably is followed by drying to remove solvent, and curing to achieve a desired degree of cross-linking. Curing preferably occurs at least partially at elevated temperatures (typically in excess of ten minutes and up to one hour or more at temperatures of up to 60°C).<br>
Each layer of the sheet may be cast in a single operation. Alternatively, particularly for layers that are relatively thick (ie that are thick relative to other layers of the sheet), a layer may be built up by successive casting of thinner sublayers.<br>
Once manufactured, and prior to use, the sheet according to the invention will typically have a water content of less than 10% w/w, and more commonly less<br>
than 5% w/w.<br>
During manufacture an image or alphanumeric marking may be printed onto the surface of the individual layers of the sheet. This marking may be used to distinguish the tissue adhesive surface from the non adhesive surface, alternatively it may be used to denote the identity of the product or manufacturer. A chromophore that may be used as a marking agent includes methylene blue.<br>
Typically, implantable devices according to the invention may be prepared by any convenient method of applying the coating to the device. For example, the layers of the coating may be cast on the device in an analogous manner to the way in which the materials of the structural layer or laminate and tissue-contacting layer are cast, as described above. Alternatively, the coating may be applied by dipping of a device in liquid formulations or by spraying the device with liquid formulations.<br>
Therapeutic applications of the sheet<br>
The sheet according to the invention is suitable for application to both internal and external surfaces of the body, ie it may be applied topically to the exterior of the body (eg to the skin) or to internal surfaces such as surfaces of internal organs exposed during surgical procedures, including conventional and minimally invasive surgery.<br>
The sheet according to the invention is particularly suitable for surgical applications in the following areas:<br>
Thoracic / cardiovascular<br>
General surgery<br>
ENT<br>
Urology<br>
Oral / maxillofacial<br>
Orthopaedic<br>
Neurological<br>
Gastroenterology<br>
Ophthalmology<br>
Gynaecology / obstetrics<br>
Possible uses are described in more detail below.<br>
Wound healing<br>
The degradable nature of the sheet means that it may support and promote wound healing during both internal and topical procedures.   Once the sheet begins to degrade, fibroblasts will move in and begin to deposit components of the extracellular matrix.   The sheet can therefore be used as an internal or external dressing.   In addition, factors such as growth factors and cAMP that are known to promote the proliferation of skin cells may be added to the formulation to assist in the healing process. The sheet may be designed to control the transmission of<br>
moisture and infectious agents, and thus be useful particularly in the treatment of burns.<br>
Skin closure<br>
The sheet may be applied topically to promote wound closure (as an alternative to sutures).   This may have beneficial effects in that it may reduce scarring, and the formulation and sheet may thus be useful for cosmetic purposes during minor surgery (eg in Accident &amp; Emergency Departments). Self-adhesive properties of the sheet may make it easy to apply quickly<br>
Hernia repair<br>
The sheet may be used to provide reinforcement in hernia repair procedures. The self-adhesive attachment overcomes the potential issues faced by conventional surgical reinforcing mesh products, which require suturing or stapling in an already weakened area. The sheet for such a procedure may be engineered to have short or long term durability, depending on the degree of tissue repair required. The sheet may also be able to withstand the application of staples.<br>
The invention may also find application in the provision of an adhesive coating to hernia mesh devices.<br>
Anastomosis<br>
The sheet provides a means for rapid sealing of, and prevention of leaks in, joined tubular structures such as blood vessels, and vascular and bladder grafts, and the Gl tract. The ability of the sheet to support tissue repair may be of particular value if used in nerve repair.<br>
Sealing large areas of tissue<br>
The good sealing and handling properties of the sheet, combined with its self-adhesive properties and ability to cover a large surface area, mean that it may be of particular use in sealing resected tissue surfaces - in particular those where diffuse bleeding is an issue (eg the liver). The sheet also provides an ideal<br>
support matrix for tissue repair at such sites. This could also be applicable to limiting leakage of cerebro-spinal fluid following neurological surgery.<br>
Sealing air leaks<br>
In addition to the patch properties described above, the high tensile strength and good inherent elasticity of the sheet (after hydration and reaction of the tissue-reactive functional groups), make it particularly suitable for sealing air leaks in the lung, particularly following lung resection. Again, after effecting a seal, the sheet provides an ideal support matrix for tissue repair at such sites.<br>
Haemostasis<br>
The sheet may be applied to a bleeding area, acting as a physical barrier. The<br>
tissue-reactive material in the sheet may immobilise proteins and thereby promote<br>
haemostasis.<br>
Therapeutic agent administration<br>
Drugs, anti-infectives and other therapeutic agents (including biologically active agents such as growth factors, and even cells and cellular components) may be added to solution(s) used to form the components of the sheet, or covalently linked to components prior to their use in the manufacture of the sheet. Once the sheet is in place, following application to the desired site, the drug will be slowly released, either by diffusion or by engineering the sheet, eg by controlling the degree of cross-linking within that sheet, so that as it degrades over time the drug is released. The rate of release can be controlled by appropriate design of the sheet. The sheet may thus provide a means for delivering a known amount of drug either systemically or to a precise locus. The drug may be directly bound to a component of a solution used in the manufacture of the sheet, or simply dispersed in the solution.<br>
Prevention of post-surgical adhesions<br>
Post-surgical adhesion, the formation of undesired connective tissue between<br>
adjacent tissues, is a serious problem which can give rise to major post-surgical<br>
complications. It is a particular problem in bowel surgery where it can cause, for instance, twisting of the bowel, which may then necessitate further surgical intervention. The application of sheet material in accordance with the invention to tissues exposed in a surgical procedure can be effective in preventing postsurgical adhesions between that tissue and neighbouring tissues.<br>
Minimally invasive procedures<br>
The use of minimally invasive techniques for taking tissue samples by biopsy, inserting devices, delivery of therapeutic agents and performing surgical procedures is rapidly developing as an alternative choice to traditional "open" surgery. Minimally invasive procedures typically result in less pain, scarring, quicker recovery time and fewer post-operative complications for patients, as well as a reduction in health care costs. Procedures are undertaken using specially designed instruments which are inserted through small keyhole-sized surgical incisions. The sheet may be introduced into the body via existing and specially designed minimally invasive surgery instruments and trocar systems, and the sheet may be shaped or prepared to an appropriate size and configuration, including buttresses for use with stapling devices. The flexibility of the sheet enables it to be formed into a configuration of reduced size, for instance by folding or rolling the sheet, and hence facilitates the use of the sheet in minimally invasive surgery procedures and/or other procedures where access is restricted. The good initial contact adhesion of the sheet to the tissue to which it is applied may also be particularly useful in such procedures.<br>

immediate stabilisation of the injury site, resulting in satisfactory haemo- and/or<br>
pneumostasis.<br>
Healing evaluated macroscopically and by histological examination of tissues 14 days post-application reveals good healing and sealing of the original injury site with normal tissue adjacent to the remains of the sheet. These remains are encapsulated by a thin fibrous covering. The remaining material continues to be resorbed by macrophagic activity and cellular infiltration, which is largely complete by 50 days.<br>
Example 6<br>

The reaction is left at 80°C for 17-19 hours and then allowed to cool to room temperature.  125.6g (1.09 moles) of NHS is dissolved in the polymer solution followed by the addition of 112.6g (0.545 moles) of DCC dissolved in 225ml of DMF. The reaction is left stirring at room temperature for 96 hours. The reaction by-product, DCU, is removed by filtration under reduced pressure using a sintered glass filter. The polymer is isolated by mixing with 2000ml of IPA followed by precipitation from 13000ml of diethyl ether followed by filtration. The polymer is washed three times in 2500ml of diethyl ether and then dried at 4Q°C under reduced pressure.<br>
The polymer is purified further to remove trace amounts of contaminants by a Soxhlet extraction using IPA.<br>
