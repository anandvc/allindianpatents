"A diagnostic device"<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
		A diagnostic device for the pathologies of tubular<br>
	anatomical structures, such as for example the<br>
5	intestinal tracts, is the object of the present<br>
	invention. In particular, the present invention relates<br>
	to a diagnostic device for pathologies of the colon or<br>
	the rectum such as for example intussusception,<br>
	stenosis, prolapse, rectocele.<br>
10		The need for the availability of a diagnostic<br>
	device for the aforementioned pathologies, which can be<br>
	manufactured with limited expense, usable even in non<br>
	hospital or clinical structures and which gives rise to<br>
	the least possible discomfort in patients, avoiding for<br>
15	example the administration of sedatives, is particularly<br>
	felt within the field. Furthermore, the need for the<br>
	availability of a diagnostic device which allows the<br>
	verification of the presence and the extent of a mucosal<br>
	prolapse is particularly felt.<br>
20	Diagnostic devices, such as flexible colonoscopes<br>
	and sigmoidoscopes which have significant drawbacks are<br>
	known. Generally, colonoscopes work by the insufflation<br>
	of air in order to dilate the walls of the intestinal<br>
	tract subjected to analyses. The insufflation of air<br>
25	gives rise to significant discomfort in the patients and<br><br>
2<br>
	frequently it is necessary to resort to the<br>
	administration of sedatives. Furthermore, the<br>
	insufflation of air causes dilation of the rectum with<br>
	the consequence that any possible mucosal prolapse<br>
5	disappears and may not be viewed.<br>
		Anoscopes which allow the direct vision of the area<br>
	involved and which can also be of large dimensions, for<br>
	example with diameters greater than 2 cm, are also<br>
	known, causing pain during insertion and requiring the<br>
10	relaxation of the sphincter.<br>
		Due to the complexity and the expense of the<br>
	equipment required, in addition to the high discomfort<br>
	which they cause in patients, frequently the only<br>
	structures which are so equipped are hospitals or<br>
15	clinics, requiring therefore that the majority of the<br>
	diagnostic procedures be carried out in such<br>
	environments.<br>
		The problem at the heart of the present invention<br>
	is that of providing a diagnostic device for the<br>
20	pathologies of the intestinal tracts, in particular of<br>
	the rectum and colon, which has structural and<br>
	operational characteristics such as to satisfy the<br>
	aforementioned needs and to overcome the aforementioned<br>
	drawbacks cited in reference to the known art.<br>
25		Such a problem is solved by a diagnostic device in<br><br>
3<br>
	accordance with claim 1. The dependent claims refer to<br>
	further embodiments of the device according to the<br>
	present invention.<br>
		Further characteristics and advantages of the<br>
5	diagnostic device according to the invention will arise<br>
	from the following reported description of its preferred<br>
	exemplary embodiments, which are given as non-limiting<br>
	indication, with reference to the attached figures,<br>

		Figure 9 is a partially exploded, perspective view<br>
	of a possible embodiment of the diagnostic device<br>
10	according to the present invention;<br>
		The present invention generally relates to a<br>
	diagnostic device for pathologies of tubular anatomical<br>
	structures, such as the intestinal tracts for example of<br>
	the rectum and colon. In general terms the device<br>
15	advantageously comprises an elongated structure which<br>
	develops between a proximal end and a distal end and<br>
	which is suitable for being inserted within the anatomic<br>
	structure to be examined. Means for locally dilating the<br>
	walls of the tubular structure associated with the<br>
20	distal end of the elongated structure are further<br>
	provided. The means for dilating are movable between a<br>
	closed position for the introduction of the device and<br>
	at least one open position for the viewing and the<br>
	evaluation of the pathology.<br>
25	The means for locally dilating are operatively<br><br>
5<br>
	connected with control means associated with the<br>
	proximal end of the elongated structure. These control<br>
	means are actuated by the operator in order to open or<br>
	close the dilating means.<br>
5		In addition, viewing means suitable for being<br>
	associated with the elongated structure and for reaching<br>
	the tract dilated by the means of dilating are provided.<br>
		In general terms, which can be applied to any<br>
	embodiment of the device according to the present<br>
10	invention, by proximal is conventionally meant either a<br>
	portion or end of the device which, whilst in use, is<br>
	near to the operator holding the device and carrying out<br>
	the examination, whereas by distal is conventionally<br>
	meant either a portion or end of the device which,<br>
15	whilst in use, is remote with respect to the operator<br>
	carrying out the examination. Furthermore, by the term<br>
	advancement is meant a movement, preferably translation,<br>
	carried out in the direction from the proximal end<br>
	towards the distal end (for example along the arrow F of<br>
20	Figure 3) , whereas by withdrawal is meant a movement,<br>
	preferably translation, carried out in the direction<br>
	from the distal end towards the proximal end (for<br>
	example along the arrow F' of Figure 2).<br>
		Some embodiments of such a device will be described<br>
25	below, for example with reference to the annexed<br><br>
6<br>
	figures.<br>
		With reference to the Figures 1-3, by 10 has been<br>
	generally indicated a trans-anal diagnostic device<br>
	according to a first embodiment. The elements in common<br>
5	throughout the illustrated embodiments will be described<br>
	and designated with the same numeral.<br>
		With 12 has been designated an inner tube<br>
	preferably of a cylindrical shape and hollow inside. The<br>
	inner tube 12 may be for example in semi-rigid or<br>
10	flexible material, for example in plastic material.<br>
		The inner tube 12 extends between a proximal end<br>
	12a and a distal end 12b. The proximal end 12a is<br>
	operatively associated with a grip member 14, for<br>
	example in the shape of a handle. More in particular,<br>
15	the inner tube is partially housed within a cylindrical<br>
	cavity 15 of the grip member 14 and is free to slide<br>
	therein along its longitudinal axis.<br>
		According to a possible embodiment, two slots 16<br>
	are formed in portions that are diametrically opposed to<br>
20	the inner tube 12 and near the proximal end 12a. More<br>
	in particular, the slot 16 extends in the<br>
	circumferential direction relative to the inner tube 12.<br>
	Preferably both slots pass through the entire thickness<br>
	of the inner tube 12.<br>
25	The distal end 12b of the inner tube is operatively<br><br>
7<br>
	linked to arms or petals 22 preferably extending in the<br>
	longitudinal direction relative to the inner tube 12.<br>
	Advantageously, the arms 22 are formed as one piece with<br>
	the inner tube 12. A possible embodiment of the arms 22<br>
5	will be described below with reference to Figures 4-6.<br>
		Figures 4-6, in fact, show an enlarged detail of<br>
	the distal end of the diagnostic device.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, an arm 22<br>
	of the inner tube 12 comprises a hook 24 extending out<br>
10	of the arm, in a substantially radial direction. More in<br>
	detail, the hook 24 has an L-configuration extending<br>
	from one side of arm 22 and runs down the arm in a<br>
	crosswise manner. In other words, the hook 24 defines a<br>
	seat being laterally opened on arm 22. Yet in other<br>
15	words, the hook 24 comprises a first tract 24a extending<br>
	from the arm 22 perpendicular thereto and towards the<br>
	exterior of the arm, and a second tract 24b extending<br>
	perpendicular to the first one crosswise to the<br>
	longitudinal development of the arm 22. Preferably, the<br>
20	length of second tract as measured along the<br>
	longitudinal direction of arm 22 is greater than that of<br>
	the first tract. Furthermore, the second tract<br>
	preferably extends along a width, as measured crosswise<br>
	to the longitudinal direction of the arm, which is equal<br>
25	to about the width of the arm.<br><br>
8<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the free<br>
	end 22a of the arms has an enlargement 26 such as to<br>
	have a greater thickness than the remaining portion of<br>
	the arm. Advantageously, the enlargement 26 is arranged<br>
5	at the hook 24.<br>
		The arms 22 are suitable to assume at least two<br>
	extreme configurations corresponding to a closed<br>
	configuration (Figure 5) and completely open<br>
	configuration (Figure 4) . In the closed configuration,<br>
10	the free ends of the arms 22 are in contact to each<br>
	other and the tip or distal end of the diagnostic device<br>
	is substantially olive-shaped. In the open<br>
	configuration, the arms 22 mutually detach and assume a<br>
	configuration which is substantially cup-shaped.<br>
15		In accordance with a possible embodiment, at least<br>
	one of the arms 22 has detection elements or markers 27<br>
	therein, which are preferably numerated along the<br>
	longitudinal direction of the arm in order to evaluate<br>
	the extent of the pathology encountered.<br>
20		With reference to the embodiment illustrated in<br>
	Figures 1-3, an outer tube has been overall designated<br>
	with 28. In the assembled configuration of the device<br>
	10, the outer tube 28 houses the inner tube 12 therein.<br>
	With reference also to the outer tube 28 a proximal end<br>
25	designated with 28a and a distal end designated with 28b<br><br>
9<br>
	can be identified. According to a possible embodiment,<br>
	the outer tube 28 can be made of semi-rigid or flexible<br>
	material, for example of plastic material.<br>
		According to a possible embodiment, the outer tube<br>
5	28 may have one or more detection elements or markers<br>
	30, for example distributed along the length of the<br>
	outer tube itself, in order to measure the length of<br>
	penetration of the device inside the anus and<br>
	accordingly the location of the pathology encountered.<br>
10		According to one possible embodiment the markers 30<br>
	have the shape of circular rings that are arranged<br>
	transversal to the tube, which are preferably numerated<br>
	and distributed along the length of the outer tube.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the<br>
15	proximal end 28a of the outer tube has an annular rib<br>
	29. In accordance with a further embodiment, the<br>
	proximal end 28a of the outer tube has at least one hole<br>
	31, preferably two holes that are arranged diametrically<br>
	opposed on the outer tube and preferably passing through<br>
20	the thickness of the outer tube. In the event that both<br>
	the annular rib 29 and the holes 31 are advantageously<br>
	provided, the latter are formed at the annular rib.<br>
		Advantageously, the outer tube 28 is shorter than<br>
	the inner tube 12 such that a portion of the inner tube<br>
25	starting from the proximal end of the inner tube<br><br>
10<br>
	projects from the proximal end of the outer tube, for<br>
	example within the cylindrical cavity 15 of the grip<br>
	member 14.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the outer<br>
5	tube and the inner tube are partially housed within the<br>
	grip member 14, more precisely within the cylindrical<br>
	cavity 15.<br>
		The distal end 28b of the outer tube is operatively<br>
	linked to arms or petals 32 preferably extending in the<br>
10	longitudinal direction relative to the outer tube 28.<br>
	Advantageously, the arms 32 are formed as one piece with<br>
	the outer tube 28. Figures 4-6 show in detail a possible<br>
	embodiment of the arms 32 of the outer tube.<br>
		To each arm 22 of the inner tube 12 there<br>
15	corresponds an arm 32 of the outer tube 28, and in the<br>
	assembled configuration of the device 10, the two<br>
	associated arms overlap.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the arms<br>
	22 of the inner tube 12 and the arms 32 of the outer<br>
20	tube 28 have such a configuration suitable to mutual<br>
	coupling, particularly by means of a shape-coupling that<br>
	allows to control the opening and closure of the arms 32<br>
	of the outer tube 28 by opening and closing the arms 22<br>
	of the inner tube 12.<br>
25		With reference to Figures 4-6 and particularly<br><br>
11<br>
	Figure 6, each arm 32 has a seat 34 on the side thereof<br>
	which is suitable to receive a portion of the hook 24<br>
	and particularly the first tract 24a. Furthermore, the<br>
	distal end of the arms 32 has a step 36 suitable to abut<br>
5	against the hook 24, and particularly against the second<br>
	tract 24b.<br>
		The mutual assembly of the arms 22 of the inner<br>
	tube 12 and the arms 32 of the outer tube 28 provides<br>
	that one tube is inserted inside the other such that the<br>
10	respective arms are slightly angularly offset. A slight<br>
	mutual rotation of the two tubes will bring each arm 32<br>
	of the outer tube into the seat being defined by the<br>
	respective hook 24. The seat 34 houses the first tract<br>
	24a whereas the second tract 24b abuts against the step<br>
15	36.<br>
		Preferably, the thickness of step 36 decreases<br>
	towards the free end of the arm 32.<br>
		The arms 32 of the outer tube 28 are suitable for<br>
	assuming at least two extreme configurations<br>
20	corresponding to a closed configuration (Figure 5) and a<br>
	completely open configuration (Figure 4). In the closed<br>
	configuration, the free ends of the arms 32 are in<br>
	contact to each other and the tip or distal end of the<br>
	diagnostic device is substantially olive-shaped. In the<br>
25	open configuration, the arms 32 mutually detach and<br><br>
12<br>
	assume a configuration which is substantially cup-<br>
	shaped.<br>
		The passage between the two open/closed extreme<br>
	positions of the distal end of the device is carried out<br>
5	by means of a relative translation of the inner tube 12<br>
	and the outer tube 28. Advantageously, the arms 32 of<br>
	the outer tube 28 are idle and controlled by the arms 22<br>
	of the inner tube both for opening and closing.<br>
		Considering the stationary outer tube and the<br>
10	moving inner tube, by making the inner tube advance<br>
	along the arrow F one passes from the closed<br>
	configuration (Figure 5) to the open configuration<br>
	(Figure 4) . In fact, both the first tract 24a and the<br>
	second tract 24b push each arm 32 of the outer tube to a<br>
15	radially wider position. On the contrary, a backward<br>
	movement of the inner tube along the arrow F' causes the<br>
	arms 22 of the inner tube and 32 of the outer tube to<br>
	shift from the open configuration (Figure 4) to the<br>
	closed configuration (Figure 5) . In fact, the first<br>
20	tract 24a of the hook 24 cooperates with the arm 32 of<br>
	the outer tube 28, within the seat 34, whereas the<br>
	second tract 24b cooperates with the outer surface of<br>
	the arm 32 by dragging each corresponding arm 32 of the<br>
	outer tube 28 to closure.<br>
25		According to a possible embodiment, a membrane 38<br><br>
13<br>
	preferably made from plastic or foldable material is fit<br>
	on the distal end of the outer tube 28, i.e. on the arms<br>
	32. According to a possible embodiment, the membrane is<br>
	made from transparent material.<br>
5		Figures 1-3 show a possible embodiment of the means<br>
	for actuating a relative translation movement between<br>
	the inner tube 12 and the outer tube 28. Specifically,<br>
	these means are suitable for translating the inner tube<br>
	12 relative to the stationary outer tube 28, but it may<br>
10	also be provided otherwise.<br>
		The grip member 14 has an elongated opening 49<br>
	allowing the connection between the inner tube 12 and a<br>
	control slide 42. Preferably, the control slide is fork-<br>
	shaped in order to be connected to the inner tube at<br>
15	portions diametrically opposed thereon.<br>
		Particularly, the contxol slide 42 has ends that<br>
	are suitable to be inserted in the slots 16 of the inner<br>
	tube, from the outside of the inner tube. In the case<br>
	where the control slide is fork-shaped, the ends of the<br>
20	prongs comprise relative pins 44 which are suitable to<br>
	be inserted into the slots 16.<br>
		A control member 46 is operatively associated with<br>
	the control slide 42 to generate a forward and backward<br>
	motion of the inner tube within the outer tube.<br>
25		Advantageously, the control member 4 6 is configured<br><br>
14<br>
	as a lever with an end connected to the grip member 14<br>
	by means of a pin 48. The connection between the control<br>
	member 46 and the control slide 42 is provided by a<br>
	further pin 50 that is mounted on the control member 46<br>
5	in an intermediate area between the pin 40 and the free<br>
	end of the control member 46.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the grip<br>
	member 14 comprises a ring 52 to receive the thumb of<br>
	the operator's hand.<br>
10		According to an advantageous embodiment, besides to<br>
	what has been described above, there is provided a guide<br>
	profile 54 which is housed in a longitudinal groove 56<br>
	of the grip member 14. The pins 44 also extend outside<br>
	the inner tube for being inserted into the guide profile<br>
15	54.<br>
		In accordance with a possible embodiment, the<br>
	cylindrical cavity 15 of the grip member 14 is counter-<br>
	shaped relative to the annular rib 29 of the outer tube<br>
	such as to prevent that the outer tube may translate<br>
20	within the grip member 14. Furthermore, the cylindrical<br>
	cavity 15 may have pins 58 suitable to be inserted in<br>
	the holes 31, if provided, of the outer tube in order to<br>
	prevent that the outer tube may rotate within the grip<br>
	member 14.<br>
25		With reference to the embodiment illustrated in<br><br>
15<br>
	Figures 1-3, the operator holds the grip member 14, by<br>
	passing his thumb through the ring 52, if present, and<br>
	gripping the control member 46.<br>
		From the open position from Figure 1 or 3, the<br>
5	operator rotates the control member 46 by closing the<br>
	same towards the grip member body. The control slide 42<br>
	pushes the inner tube 12 backwards thereby closing the<br>
	arms of the inner tube and the outer tube such as<br>
	described above. The pins 44 are free to slide along the<br>
10	slots 16 in the circumferential direction relative to<br>
	the tube. The cylindrical cavity 15 has such an<br>
	extension allowing a translation movement of the inner<br>
	tube that is sufficient for the arms to shift between<br>
	the two extreme open/closed positions.<br>
15		With reference to the definition of the device<br>
	according to the present invention, the inner tube and<br>
	the outer tube define the elongated structure developing<br>
	between a proximal end and a distal end. The length of<br>
	the elongated structure may be changed. As a function of<br>
20	the material with which the inner tube and the outer<br>
	tube are made, the elongated structure can be either<br>
	semi-rigid or flexible. The arms 22 of the device 10<br>
	define means for locally dilating the walls of the<br>
	anatomical structure of interest, which are associated<br>
25	with the distal end of the elongated structure. The<br><br>
16<br>
	control means comprise the inner tube and the outer tube<br>
	which can slide one inside the other and the means which<br>
	cause this relative translation.<br>
		The device 10 in the closed position is introduced<br>
5	transanally into the rectum/colon sigmoid/colon of the<br>
	patient by the physician or the operator carrying out<br>
	the examination. The degree of introduction of the<br>
	device 10 can be verified using the markers 30 on the<br>
	outer tube 28, if present. The insertion of the device<br>
10	10 is facilitated by the olive-shape of the distal tip<br>
	of the device, i.e. of the arms 22 and 32.<br>
		When the desired position has been reached, the<br>
	distal end of the device is opened "flower-like" such as<br>
	to gradually widen the area of interest, as will be<br>
15	described below with reference to the embodiment in<br>
	question.<br>
		The operations described above for opening the<br>
	distal end of the device 10, in which a translation of<br>
	the inner tube 12 is provided to be generated relative<br>
20	to the grip member 14 and outer tube 28, can be<br>
	similarly carried out by generating a translation of the<br>
	outer tube relative to the inner tube and grip member.<br>
		The device 10 described above may be used in<br>
	association with viewing equipment (for example<br>
25	laparoscopes 60) which are introduced into the inner<br><br>
17<br>
	tube 12 and which, thanks to the opening of the arms 22,<br>
	can be directed towards the appropriately widened area<br>
	of interest such that the operator (physician) can check<br>
	for the presence and the extent of the various<br>
5	pathologies. In other words the inner tube 12 allows the<br>
	passage of illuminating and optical elements for the<br>
	viewing of the area of interest.<br>
		Alternatively, the device 10 can be associated with<br>
	an apparatus provided with a colon-scope and<br>
10	insufflation device available from specialist medical<br>
	practitioners.<br>
		By gradually and selectively widening the distal<br>
	end of the device 10, for example, one can check the<br>
	response of the mucosa by mimicking defecation.<br>
15		The present device allows the diagnosis of various<br>
	pathologies among which intussusception, stenosis,<br>
	prolapse, rectocele. The location of the defect can be<br>
	quantified by means of the markers arranged on the outer<br>
	tube. The extent of the defect can be quantified as a<br>
20	function of the location to which the mucosa falls along<br>
	the markers on the arms.<br>
		The device 10 can additionally be moved backwards<br>
	or forwards while opening and closing the same in order<br>
	to allow the analyses of the various sections of tissues<br>
25	and in order to diagnose the conditions of the prolapse.<br><br>
18<br>
		From what has been stated above, one can appreciate<br>
	how providing a diagnostic device according to the<br>
	present invention allows to have available a low cost<br>
	device useful in the diagnosis of pathologies of tubular<br>
5	anatomical structures such as colon-rectal tracts. For<br>
	example it is possible to identify and evaluate<br>
	pathologies like intestinal blockages, intussusception,<br>
	stenosis, prolapse and rectocele.<br>
		Being capable of carrying out the diagnosis and<br>
10	quantification of a rectal prolapse is particularly<br>
	advantageous, since the known devices, particularly<br>
	colonoscopes, do not allow the diagnosis of such a<br>
	pathology. Indeed colonoscopes require insufflation of<br>
	air which causes rectal dilation and consequently the<br>
15	disappearance of the mucosal prolapse.<br>
		In addition to what has been described above, the<br>
	diagnostic device according to the present invention<br>
	reduces patient's discomfort and can be used even<br>
	without the administration of sedatives, being much<br>
20	easier to introduce with respect to the known devices<br>
	and does not require the insufflation of air.<br>
		An additional advantage of the diagnostic device<br>
	according to the present invention is linked to the<br>
	small size in which it can be made, eliminating the<br>
25	drawbacks of the direct vision anoscopes which are<br><br>
19<br>
	painful and require the relaxation of the sphincter in<br>
	that they have rather large dimensions.<br>
		In addition to what has been stated above, the<br>
	diagnostic device according to the present invention can<br>
5	also be used on an outpatient basis, or in any case in<br>
	non hospital or clinical environments, being a simple<br>
	structure, easy to use and having a low cost, and which<br>
	does not require the administration of sedatives.<br>
		In particular providing a tip or head or distal end<br>
10	which is non traumatic both during insertion in the<br>
	closed position and during use in the open position is<br>
	particularly advantageous.<br>
		Furthermore, the risk that the tissue may sag or be<br>
	caught in the jaws of the device is minimised or even<br>
15	eliminated.<br>
		The variety of materials with which both the inner<br>
	tube and the outer tube can be made also allows the<br>
	attainment of a relatively flexible elongated structure,<br>
	adapted to being easily introduced in particular up to<br>
20	the sigmoidal colon.<br>
		The use of markers, both on the outer tube and on<br>
	the arms allow respectively to quantify the depth of<br>
	insertion of the device and to quantify the prolapse.<br>
		The conformation of the device allows, in the<br>
25	closed position, the limiting of the risk that<br><br>
20<br>
	extraneous elements may introduce themselves into the<br>
	interior of the device itself.<br>
		The shape reached in the completely open position<br>
	is particularly advantageous for initiating a response<br>
5	from the sphincter. In addition, the shape of the arms<br>
	is preferably designed such as to have maximum radial<br>
	opening at the distal end of the device.<br>
		It should be understood that variations and/or<br>
	additions to what has been described and illustrated<br>
10	above may be provided.<br>
		The shape, both of the inner tube and the outer<br>
	tube can vary with respect to what has been described<br>
	and illustrated above. The materials may also be<br>
	different. For example, the embodiments described above<br>
15	provide idle arms, i.e. both the opening and closing of<br>
	the arms 22 and 32 are controlled by the operator. By<br>
	changing the materials, one may obtain a device in which<br>
	the arms are naturally open and the shifting between the<br>
	closed and open positions mainly occurs by elastic<br>
20	effect after the physician has left the inner tube slide<br>
	freely within the outer tube.<br>
		The shape-coupling between the arms of the inner<br>
	tube and outer tube can be different. For example,<br>
	either the step 36 or tract 24b may be omitted.<br>
25		The distal end of the device, i.e. the<br><br>
21<br>
	configuration of the arms 22 and 32 may also be<br>
	associated with other types of command or control of the<br>
	translation of the inner tube 12 relative to the outer<br>
	tube 28. For example, there may be used similar commands<br>
5	as those that will be described below with reference to<br>
	further embodiments of the diagnostic device according<br>
	to the present invention.<br>
		Analogously, the command for translating the inner<br>
	tube 12 relative to the outer tube 28 may be used with<br>
10	different embodiments of the distal tip.<br>
		Figures 7 and 8 show a possible embodiment of the<br>
	diagnostic device 10. Particularly, Figures 7 and 8 show<br>
	a possible embodiment of the means generating a relative<br>
	translation between the inner tube and the outer tube.<br>
15	The elements in common with the above embodiments have<br>
	been designated with the same numerals.<br>
		The cylindrical cavity 15 of the grip member 14 is<br>
	counter-shaped relative to the annular rib 29 of the<br>
	outer tube and advantageously has the pins 31 which are<br>
20	suitable to be inserted into the holes of the outer<br>
	tube. The translation and rotation movement of the outer<br>
	tube relative to the grip member are then prevented.<br>
		The translation of the inner tube relative to the<br>
	outer tube and grip member is controlled by a control<br>
25	slide 42 which is suitable to be pivoted to the grip<br><br>
22<br>
	member and interact with the inner tube. The control<br>
	slide 42 is housed in the grip member 14 by being<br>
	inserted in an aperture 40.<br>
		Particularly, the control slide 42 is forked-<br>
5	shaped. The free ends of the prongs are suitable to be<br>
	inserted in the slots 16 of the inner tube.<br>
	Advantageously, the control slide 42 is pivoted to the<br>
	grip member in an intermediate area between the prong<br>
	ends and the free end of the control slide.<br>
10		The cylindrical cavity 15 of the grip member 14 has<br>
	a notch 62 allowing the rotation of the control slide<br>
	42.<br>
		The method for employing the embodiment of the<br>
	above diagnostic device is described below. In general<br>
15	terms, it is similar to that of the embodiment described<br>
	above. In other words, the relative translation of the<br>
	inner tube and the outer tube gradually change the<br>
	configuration of the distal end of the device from a<br>
	closed configuration to a completely open configuration<br>
20	and vice versa.<br>
		In the embodiment described below, the relative<br>
	translation between the inner tube and the outer tube is<br>
	obtained by rotating the control slide 42 relative to<br>
	the grip member being held by the operator. The control<br>
25	slide 42 acts directly on the inner tube 12 thereby<br><br>
23<br>
	causing the same to rotate relative- to the grip member<br>
	and the outer tube, either forwards or backwards,<br>
	(arrows F and F' ) as a function of the direction of<br>
	rotation of the control slide 42.<br>
5		Depending on the materials, the opening of the arms<br>
	may be either directly controlled by the physician or<br>
	affected by the elasticity of the material.<br>
		The advantages discussed above also find validity<br>
	in the further embodiment described above. It should be<br>
10	understood that variations and/or additions to what has<br>
	been described and illustrated above may be provided.<br>
		Also in this case, it may also be provided that the<br>
	outer tube translates relative to the inner tube.<br>
		The means suitable to generate the relative<br>
15	translation movement between the inner tube and the<br>
	outer tube as described with reference to the Figures 7-<br>
	8 can be used with any embodiment of the distal end of<br>
	the device, particularly the arms 22 and 32. For<br>
	example, they can be used with the embodiment shown in<br>
20	Figures 4-6 or any other embodiment.<br>
		Figure 9 shows a possible further embodiment of the<br>
	diagnostic device according to the present invention.<br>
	For clarity purposes, the elements in common with the<br>
	above embodiments will be designated with the same<br>
25	numerals.<br><br>
24<br>
		The structure of the outer tube and the coupling<br>
	thereof with the grip member 14 are substantially<br>
	similar to what has been described above.<br>
		The inner tube 12 comprises an end portion 64 that<br>
5	is fitted on the proximal end of the inner tube. A pin<br>
	66 is inserted crosswise between the inner tube and the<br>
	end portion thereby making the same integral to each<br>
	other. The end portion has at least one groove 68<br>
	extending along the longitudinal direction of the inner<br>
10	tube. Preferably, two grooves 68 are provided which are<br>
	arranged diametrically opposed to each other on the end<br>
	portion. The cylindrical cavity 15 has lugs 70 that are<br>
	suitable to be inserted in the grooves 68 to prevent<br>
	that the inner tube may rotate. The dimensions of the<br>
15	lugs and respective grooves are such as to allow a<br>
	relative translation of the inner tube within the outer<br>
	tube such as to enable the same to shift from the two<br>
	extreme open/closed configurations.<br>
		The proximal end of the end portion 64 has a<br>
20	threaded tract 72.<br>
		The grip member 14 comprises a handle 7 4 that is<br>
	fitted on the proximal end of the grip member 14 and<br>
	provided with a threaded tract therein which is suitable<br>
	to engage with the threaded tract of the end portion.<br>
25		Preferably, the handle 74 is integral with a<br><br>
25<br>
	ferrule 78 in which the threaded tract is formed.<br>
		Also with this embodiment one may use a laparoscope<br>
	60 inserted within the inner tube 12 through the handle<br>
	74.<br>
5		With reference to the definition of the device<br>
	according to the present invention, the inner tube and<br>
	the outer tube define the elongated structure developing<br>
	between a proximal end and a distal end. The length of<br>
	the elongated structure may be changed. Depending on the<br>
10	material with which the inner tube and the outer tube<br>
	are made, the elongated structure can be either semi-<br>
	rigid or flexible. The control means comprise the inner<br>
	tube and the outer tube that can slide one inside the<br>
	other and the means which cause this relative<br>
15	translation.<br>
		The method for employing the embodiment of the<br>
	above diagnostic device is described below. In general<br>
	terms, it is analogous to that of the embodiment<br>
	described above. In other words, the relative<br>
20	translation of the inner tube and the outer tube<br>
	gradually change the configuration of the distal end of<br>
	the device from a closed configuration to a completely<br>
	open configuration and vice versa.<br>
		In the embodiment described above, the relative<br>
25	translation of the inner tube within the outer tube is<br><br>
26<br>
	obtained by rotating the handle 74 relative to the grip<br>
	member being held by the operator. By rotating the<br>
	handle, the end portion and inner tube translate<br>
	relative to the grip member and the outer tube either<br>
5	forwards or backwards (arrows F and F' ) as a function of<br>
	the direction of rotation of the handle.<br>
		The rotation of the inner tube is prevented by the<br>
	coupling between the lugs 70 of the grip member and the<br>
	grooves 68 of the end portion.<br>
10		The relative translation between the inner tube and<br>
	the outer tube causes the distal end of the device to<br>
	open or close depending on the embodiment being used.<br>
	In fact, the means controlling the relative translation<br>
	between the inner tube and the outer tube as described<br>
15	above can be associated with any means for widening the<br>
	distal end of the device. Fox example, similar arms to<br>
	those described in the embodiment illustrated in Figures<br>
	4-6 or other embodiments may be provided.<br>
		The application mode and method for introduction<br>
20	and visualization are similar to those described above<br>
	for the first embodiment.<br>
		The advantages discussed above also find validity<br>
	in the further embodiment described above. It should be<br>
	understood that variations and/or additions to what has<br>
25	been described and illustrated above may be provided.<br><br>
27<br>
		With reference to all the embodiments that have<br>
	been shown and described, there may be provided<br>
	different means suitable to change the configuration of<br>
	the means for locally dilating the walls of the tubular<br>
5	structure. For example, there may be provided means<br>
	other than and inner tube and outer tube that can be<br>
	relatively translated in order to change the<br>
	configuration of the means for locally dilating the<br>
	walls of the tubular structure.<br>
10		To the preferred embodiments of the diagnostic<br>
	device such as described above, those skilled in the<br>
	art, aiming at satisfying contingent and specific<br>
	requirements, may carry out a number of modifications,<br>
	adaptations and replacement of elements with others<br>
15	functionally equivalent, without however departing from<br>
	the scope of the claims below.<br>
