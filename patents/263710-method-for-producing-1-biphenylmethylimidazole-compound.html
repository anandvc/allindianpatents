Effects of the invention<br>
	The production method of the present invention is superior to a known production method from the industrial viewpoints of industrial practicality, total yield, reaction selectivity, providing a desired compound with high purity and the like (and particularly with respect to the points indicated below).<br>
	(i)  An industrial reaction vessel such as a reactor is usually sealed, and a reaction in such a reaction vessel is carried out under light-shielding conditions.  Since the reaction indicated in the known Method X does not proceed under light-shielding conditions, it does not have industrial practicality.  In contrast, since the reaction in the production method of the present invention [the method for producing compound (5) from compound (1)] proceeds efficiently under light-shielding conditions, it has industrial practicality.  In addition, the production method of the present invention [the method for producing compound (5) from compound (1)] is superior to the reaction indicated in the known Method X in terms of yield, even under non-light-shielding conditions.<br>
	(ii)  Although a method for converting a cyano group to a tetrazolyl group in the presence of triethylamine hydrochloride is known, the corresponding method using a cyclic amine salt is not known (see Method Y: Patent reference 3).  The production method of the present invention that uses a cyclic amine salt [the method for producing compound (10) from compound (9)] is superior to a known method in terms of yield.<br>
	(iii)  In a reaction between a compound having a cyano group and an ester group and a nucleophilic reagent, it would be predicted that the desired compound would not be obtained in good yield due to the possibility of both groups reacting with the nucleophilic reagent.  In addition, examples are also known in which the cyano group of a compound having a cyano group and an ester group selectively reacts (for example, Chemistry Letters, 1983, Vol. 8, p. 1231; Tetrahedron Letter, 2000, Vol. 41, p. 8803; Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 1991, Vol. 403, p. 21).  Moreover, although a reaction between a 1-biphenylmethyl-4-methoxycarbonylimidazole compound and a methyl Grignard reagent is known, a cyano group is not present in the starting raw materials (see Method Z: Patent reference 4).  In contrast, in the reaction in the production method of the present invention [the method for producing compound (9) from compound (14)], an ester group selectively reacts, and the desired compound (9) is obtained in good yield.<br><br>
