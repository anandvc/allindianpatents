				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a base part for electrically and mechanically receiving at least one surge arrester inserlable into the base part, wherein the base part comprises a U-shaped housing with a bottom or base unit in which a switching device for the display or remote indication of error conditions is arranged.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A surge arrester comprising a remote signaling contact for signalizing errors is already known from the German Utility Model DE 20 2004 006 227. According to this prior art, the triggering of the potential-free mechanism is accomplished by means of a thermal monitoring of inserted varistors or of the triggering unit of mains spark gaps inserted into the corresponding plug-in parts, whereby the triggering force is passed on by preloaded springs and slides or a flexible plate, respectively.<br>
In the base part of this prior overvoltage protection device, this mechanical motion is transferred by an actuating pin and a rotatably mounted switching rocker to a microswitch, which has a potential-free change-over contact at its outputs.<br>
A multi-polar surge arrester for use in low-voltage power supply systems is known from DE [00 01 667 CI, which comprises one single, substantially U-shaped base part with connection terminals in the base body for the active lines and PE or ground potential, wherein guiding means are provided in the covering hood of the base part for detachably receiving plug-type parts with varistor or spark gap elements, which parts can be electrically contacted with the connection terminals.<br>
In the embodiment according to the teaching of DE 100 01 667 CI a recess for receiving a microswitch for a remote signaling indicator is provided in the base carrier of the base part.<br><br>
Moreover, a slot extending in the longitudinal or horizontal direction is incorporated in the base carrier for the remote signaling indication, and a continuous, planar switching rocker is disposed in said slot. The switching rocker is operatively connected to the aforementioned microswitch. The base carrier comprises in the region of each protection element to be inserted an opening, which extends in a transverse or vertical direction and provides access to the switching rocker, whereby a rocker actuating component is inserted into each of the openings, the vertically projecting cam of which engages into an associated opening in the covering hood. The cam interacts with a release pin to monitor the function in the respective protection element. The rocker actuating elements comprise another cam directed toward the switching rocker as well as an integral pin to guidingly receive a helical compression spring, which is supported against the switching rocker.<br>
The switching rocker and the rocker actuating components permit the monitoring of the functions of the inserted protection elements with one single microswitch. Also an insertion control is possible.<br>
The above-described solutions have in common that all of them require an actuating rocker, with a microswitch being actuated by a rotary motion. Due to existing tolerances and a chain of tolerances caused by the individual elements, it is difficult to adjust the end point of the microswitch, so that there is the risk of a faulty release. In addition to the tolerances, the necessary rotary motions also come along with the functional bearing clearance of the fulcrum.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to obtain Base part for electrically and mechanically receiving at least one surge arrester insertable into the base part, wherein the base part comprises a U-shaped housing with a bottom or base unit in which a switching device for the display or remote indication of error conditions is arranged.<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the slide (7) comprises an angled leg (12) having a shaped part (13), which shaped part (13) extends into a wedge surface (14) so as to actuate a cam (15) of the switching device (8).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the switching device (8) is arranged in an extended space of the chamber (11) within the bottom or base unit (3).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, a rail (16) is located inside the chamber (11), which is oriented parallel to the direction of motion of the slide (7), the slide (7) comprising a groove (17) corresponding thereto.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the spring element (9) is arranged in the groove (17) of the slide (7).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the spring element (9) is captively arranged in the region of the groove (17) and is, to this end, received by two oppositely arranged bolt parts (18).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of sloping surfaces (6) is formed on the slide (7), so as to be operatively connected to several associated push-pin extensions (i; 4).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the push-pin(s) (I) is/are spring-preloaded in the direction of the insertable surge arrester, wherein, if the insertion procedure is performed correctly, the preloading spring (10) is loaded further and the slide (7) reaches a first end position under the influence of its spring element (9).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, when pulling out the insertable surge arrester (20), or when the trigger element (25) is activated, the respective push-pin (1) is moved oppositely to the insertion direction of the surge arrester (20) by using the increased preloading force of the preloading<br><br>
spring (10) and, under the influence of the sloping surfaces (5; 6), the slide (7) reaches a second end position, with the spring element (9) of the slide being loaded.<br>
The invention relates to a base part for electrically and mechanically receiving at least one surge arrester insertable into the base part, wherein the base part comprises a U-shaped housing with a bottom or base unit in which a switching device for the display or remote indication of error conditions is arranged, wherein further the housing has at least one cutout section receiving at least one spring-preloaded push-pin which is operatively connected to the switching device, wherein the push-pin is in mechanical contact with the surge arrester or with a trigger element provided in the arrester, when the surge arrester is inserted, according to the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
Based on the foregoing it is, therefore, the object of the invention to provide a further developed base part for electrically and mechanically receiving at least one surge arrester insertable into the base part, wherein the base part comprises a U-shaped housing with a bottom or base unit and a switching device for the display or remote indication of error conditions.<br>
According to the object, a triggering of the switching device is to become possible also with small relative motions, wherein a simple transformation of the direction of motion makes sure that unavoidable tolerances have no disadvantageous effect on the switching and triggering behavior. Moreover, the total unit necessary for actuating the switching device is arranged in the base part, so that the costs for the production relating to the insertable surge arrester or modules, respectively, can be reduced.<br>
The solution to the object of the invention is achieved with a base part for electrically and mechanically receiving at least one surge arrester insertable into the base part according to the combination of features defined in patent claim 1. The dependent claims describe at least useful embodiments and advancements.<br><br>
The housing of the base part comprises at least one cutout section to receive at least one spring-preloaded push-pin, The push-pin penetrates through the cutout section and can interact with its free end of the pin with the lower side of the surge arrester or a trigger element located thereat.<br>
Accordingly, if the surge arrester is inserted, the push-pin is in mechanical contact with the surge arrester or the aforementioned trigger element which, again, is connected to or actuatable by a thermal disconnecting device.<br>
The at least one spring-preloaded push-pin is movably guided in a gate of the bottom or base unit.<br>
A lower extension, which is oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion of the push-pin, has a sloping surface which corresponds with a complementary sloping surface of a slide. The slide is arranged in the bottom or base unit so as to be displaceable perpendicular to the motion of the push-pin, for transforming a motion of the push-pin into a displacing motion substantially perpendicular thereto, so that the slide can be transferred from a first position into a second position for actuating the switching device,<br>
Furthermore, the slide is preloaded by a spring element in such a manner that the sloping surfaces of the extension of the push-pin and the slide are non-positively engaged with each other.<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the push-pin may have two spaced-apart extensions each provided with a sloping surface, wherein a pin is located between the extensions to guidingly receive a preloading spring in the form of a helical compression spring.<br>
in the bottom or base unit at least one elongated chamber having a rectangular cross-section is provided to receive the extensions of the push-pin and the slide.<br><br>
In order to maximally utilize the available construction space or chamber volume, respectively, the slide may comprise an angled leg having a shaped part, which shaped part extends into a wedge surface so as to actuate a cam, especially a switching cam of the switching device or a microswitch, respectively.<br>
The switching device, especially a microswitch, is arranged in an extended space of the aforementioned chamber within the bottom or base unit. A rail is located inside the chamber, which is oriented parallel to the direction of motion of the slide.<br>
To this end, the slide comprises a corresponding groove, allowing the slide to be guidingly displaceable along the rail.<br>
A spring element may be inserted into the groove of the slide. This spring element is arranged in the region of the groove, preferably captively. To this end, two oppositely arranged bolts or pin parts are provided, which fix the spring, especially a helical compression spring.<br>
A plurality of spaced-aparl sloping surfaces may be formed on the slide, so as to be operatively connected to several associated push-pin extensions, which also permits the monitoring of multi-polar arresters received by the respective base part.<br>
The push-pin(s) is (are) preloaded in the direction of the insertable surge arrester(s), wherein, if the insertion procedure is performed correctly, the preloading spring is loaded further and the slide reaches a first end position under the influence of its spring element.<br>
When pulling out the insertable surge arrester, or when the trigger element is activated, the respective push-pin is moved oppositely to the insertion direction by using the increased preloading force of the preloading spring. Under the influence of the sloping surfaces the slide reaches a second end position, with the spring element of the slide being loaded.<br><br>
Thus, as far as the basic construction is concerned, the remote signaling operation in the base part according to the invention only requires two elements, which are preferably formed of molded or pressed plastic parts, namely the push-pin having at least a first sloping surface, and the slide having at least a second, complementarily shaped sloping surface. When both sloping surfaces are positively engaged and a motion is generated, this motion is transferred to the second element by means of the resulting wedge effect, however, with the desired reversal of the direction of motion, namely from the upward and downward motion of the push-pin to a longitudinal traversing motion of the slide. On the slide a microswitch or the push-pin thereof is actuated via the wedge surface thereof, so as to transfer the necessary remote signaling functions.<br>
A surge arrester embodiment, e.g. multi-polar for use in a TN-circuil with L-and N-input terminals on the one side and a PE- and ground connection on the opposite side, comprises two insertable surge arresters 20, which are located in a base part 21, By correspondingly designing its lower side 22 this common base part 21 is suited for top hat rail mounting (Fig. 1).<br>
In the base part a remote signaling device is provided to detect or signalize, respectively, error conditions of the insertable surge arrester(s) 20, if one or both of the surge arresters 20 are not properly inserted. A corresponding remote signaling contact can be electrically contacted free of potential via a connection terminal 23.<br>
Moreover, conductor terminals 24 known per se are provided at the base part 21.<br>
According to the representation of Fig. 2 the front insertable surge arrester 20 was pulled out, with the consequence that the push-pin 1 is no longer in contact with the lower side of the insertable surge arrester 20 or a trigger element provided thereat, respectively. Therefore, the height position of the push-pin 1<br><br>
is displaced upwardly and the switching device 8, e.g. a microswitch, can be activated.<br>
In the representation according to Fig. 3 it can be seen in the pari section thereof, how the push-pin 1 is in mechanical contact with a trigger element 25 in the surge arrester 20. This trigger element 25 is connected to a non-illustrated thermal disconnecting device located In the inserlable surge arrester 20, wherein the trigger element 25 changes its position when the thermal disconnecting device is activated.<br>
The respective error condition, i.e. released push-pin I, is shown in the representation of Fig. 4.<br>
Analogously, the push-pin 1 is released if the surge arrester 20 is pulled out of the base part 21 (see Fig. 5).<br>
When changing its/their height position, the push-pin(s) I cause(s) a change of the position of the slide 7, so that a shaped part 13 provided thereat, which has a wedge surface 14, is capable of triggering the switching device and realize a switch-on or switch-off procedure, respectively.<br>
This actuating function of the switching device 8 is once more illustrated by means of the perspective representations according to Fig. 8 and 9.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the state of the actuated push-pins of the switching device 8, i.e. the push-pins J are here in their lowermost position under the tension of the springs 10.<br>
In the state according to Fig. 9 the springs 10 are relaxed, and the push-pins 1 reach their upper position. Corresponding sloping surfaces (see Fig. 10 and 11) cause a reversal of the direction of motion (upward and downward motion of the push-pins) into a motion displacing the slide 7.<br><br>
Details of the mechanical construction for reversing the direction of motion and transferring the trigger motion shall be explained by means of Fig. 10 and 11 below.<br>
The push-pins 1 are guided in a gate 2 of the bottom and base unit 3. A lower extension 4, which is oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion of the push-pin 1, comprises a sloping surface 5. In the figures, two spaced-apart extensions 4 each with a sloping surface 5 are provided.<br>
This sloping surface 5 corresponds with a sloping surface 6 of the slide 7. This slide 7 is arranged in the bottom or base unit 3 so as to be displaceable perpendicular to the direction of motion of the push-pin 1, in order to transform a motion of the push-pin 1 into a motion of displacement extending substantially perpendicular thereto according to a straight-wedge mechanism.<br>
By this, the slide can be transferred from a first position into a second position so as to correspondingly actuate the switching device 8.<br>
The slide 7 is preloaded by means of a spring element 9, namely in such a manner that the sloping surfaces 5 and 6 are non-positively engaged with each other.<br>
Between the extensions 4 of the respective push-pin 1 a pin is provided to guidingly receive a preloading spring 10.<br>
In the bottom or base unit 3 a chamber 11 (see, for example. Fig. 2) for receiving the extensions 4 of the push-pin 1 and the slide 7 is provided.<br>
The slide 7 comprises an angled leg 12, which extends into the shaped part 13 with the wedge surface 14, so as to actuate the cam 15 of the switching device 8 (see Fig. 11).<br><br>
As can be seen, for example, in Fig, 8 and 9, the switching device 8 is located in an extended space of the chamber 11 inside the bottom or base unit 3. Moreover, a rail 16 is provided inside the chamber 11. which extends parallel to the direction of motion of the slide. The slide 7 comprises a groove 17 corresponding to the rail 16. Thus, the slide is guidingly mounted with its groove in the rail 16.<br>
The spring element 9, which serves to preload the slide 7, sits in the groove 17 of the slide 7. This spring element 9 is captively arranged in the region of the groove 17. For this purpose, two opposite bolts 18 are provided. These bolts each receive one end of the spring element 9, which is designed as a helical compression spring.<br>
Several sloping surfaces 6 may be formed on the slide 7 so as to be operatively connected to several associated push-pin extensions, namely with the purpose of monitoring a muiti-polar embodiment, in which several surge arresters are located at corresponding plug-in positions in a base part.<br>
The push-pin(s) 1 is/are spring-preloaded in the direction of the respective insertable surge arrester 20, wherein, if the insertion motion is performed properly, the preloading spring 10 is loaded further and the slide 7 reaches a first end position under the influence of the spring element 9.<br>
When pulling out the insertable surge arrester 20, or when the trigger element 25 is activated, the respective push-pin is moved opposite to the direction of insertion by using the increased preloading force of the preloading spring 10. Under the influence of the sloping surfaces 5 and 6 the slide 7 reaches a second end position, with the spring element 9 associated to the slide 7 being loaded.<br>
The energy of motion of the push-pin is transferred to the slide via the pair of sloping surfaces, the slide changing its position inside the chamber, with the result that the respective cam of the respective switching device can be actuated.<br><br>
All in all, the above-explained invention permits, in a constructively simple manner, also a multi-polar monitoring of surge arresters located in an associated base part. The device is configured such that both non-inserted or partially inserted surge arresters are detected, and that a malfunction can be detected by means of a trigger element located in the surge arrester.<br>
