"Method enabling chopping members to be changed"<br>
The present invention relates to the field of the<br>
manufacture of chopped strands for technical use,<br>
particularly strands of thermoplastic and especially<br>
glass strands.<br>
It relates more specifically to a method enabling a<br>
maintenance intervention to be performed, it being<br>
possible for this maintenance intervention for example<br>
to consist of an operation of changing the chopping<br>
members, cleaning, or to consist of any other operation<br>
that has to be carried out without the need to<br>
interrupt the production process and to a device<br>
enabling this method to be implemented.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression<br>
"without the need to interrupt the production process"<br>
is a phase in production during which the bushings<br>
produce filaments which are directed to the chopper<br>
(rather than going for scrap), even though, during this<br>
phase, the chopping machine might produce chopped<br>
strands that are unsuitable for sale as a finished<br>
product.<br>
Numerous devices capable of manufacturing in this way<br>
are known. These systems generally comprise at least<br>
one bushing from which glass strands are drawn and led<br>
into a chopping device consisting, for example, of a<br>
backup roll or anvil collaborating with a chopping roll<br>
equipped with blades distributed uniformly at its<br>
periphery.<br>
The chopping roll is arranged in such a way as to come<br>
into contact, under pressure, with the circumferential<br>
surface of the backup roll, thus defining a chopping<br>
region. During the operation of chopping the glass<br>
fiber, the chopping wheel, once it has been in use for<br>
a certain period of time, reaches a level of wear which<br>
 <br>
is such that the quality of the chopped strands no<br>
longer meets the production requirements and has<br>
therefore to be changed.<br>
There are therefore regular production stoppages on the<br>
bushings, so that a maintenance operation such as, for<br>
example, the replacement of worn wheels, can be carried<br>
out.<br>
These production stoppages lead to a loss in<br>
productivity in at least two respects: during the phase<br>
of changing the chopping members on the chopping<br>
machine, all of the production of filaments goes for<br>
scrap, and when this maintenance operation is carried<br>
out it is necessary, in order to regain nominal<br>
chopped-strand production, to prepare each bushing<br>
individually and perform a restart operation for each<br>
of them. A restart phase is defined as an operation<br>
which consists in reestablishing the continuity of the<br>
web of filaments between the bushing and the chopper.<br>
A first solution aimed at reducing productivity losses<br>
is to associate at least one choppping machine with one<br>
bushing or a small number of bushings. This solution<br>
offers the advantage of nonetheless ensuring a reduced<br>
production of chopped strands from those chopping<br>
machines that remain operational during the maintenance<br>
phase being performed on one of them, but on the other<br>
hand, this solution is limited in terms of its bulk.<br>
Associating one chopper with one bushing requires there<br>
to be enough space near the bushings for the<br>
maintenance and restart operations performed by the<br>
user. In addition, it is noted that the predictable<br>
increase in productivity (the flow rate) limits the<br>
introduction of an additional chopping machine (because<br>
of problems of physically incorporating it into an<br>
existing line).<br>
 <br>
A second solution is to use so-called "double-head"<br>
chopping machines. This solution is described for<br>
example in document EP 0 849 381 and consists in<br>
considering, on a single machine, two production heads<br>
alternately either in production or in maintenance<br>
mode. The advantage here being that the chopping unit<br>
is already equipped with a set of new wheels and that<br>
by simply rotating the machine (about a vertical axis),<br>
the chopping members are changed in a relatively<br>
shorter space of time because there is no longer a need<br>
to remove and refit the wheels while the bushings are<br>
shut down.<br>
Nonetheless, although the changing of the chopping<br>
members is done in parallel time, there still remains a<br>
time for which the production from all the bushings is<br>
sent for scrap during the operation of pivoting of the<br>
machine and during the restart phases.<br>
A third solution, described in documents FR0310046 and<br>
US6148640 has been imagined; it consists in positioning<br>
upstream of the chopping machine a drawing machine<br>
which continues to draw out the filaments while the<br>
operators are turning the chopping machine, thus<br>
limiting the undesirable effects particularly in terms<br>
of the thermal stability of the bushings or in terms of<br>
malfunctioning at the supply duct.<br>
The present invention proposes a solution to the<br>
problems mentioned hereinabove by proposing a method<br>
that enables a maintenance operation to be performed on<br>
the chopping machine, such as the changing of chopping<br>
members for example, without the need to interrupt the<br>
production process.<br>
According to the invention, the method enabling a<br>
maintenance intervention to be carried out on a<br>
chopping machine, in particular enabling the chopping<br>
 <br>
members of a chopping machine to be changed, is<br>
characterized in that<br>
-	at least one strand is drawn through a first chopping<br>
assembly in operation, said first chopping assembly<br>
comprising a chopping wheel and an anvil wheel, said<br>
first chopping assembly being secured to a chassis<br>
mounted so that it can move, particularly in<br>
rotation, about an articulation axle,<br>
-	said chassis is rotated about its axle until a second<br>
chopping assembly initially in a position of non-<br>
operation is brought into the vicinity of the strand,<br>
said second chopping assembly being secured to said<br>
chassis and comprising a chopping wheel and an anvil<br>
wheel,<br>
-	the second chopping assembly is set in operation and<br>
the strand is led in between the chopping wheel and<br>
the anvil wheel,<br>
-	said first chopping assembly is brought into the<br>
position of non-operation.<br>
By using one of the chopping assemblies as a means for<br>
drawing out the strands throughout the phase of moving<br>
the chopping machine about its articulation axle it is<br>
possible to switch from one chopping assembly to the<br>
other without having to restart the strands.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
recourse may also potentially be had to one and/or<br>
other of the following arrangements:<br>
-	the strands are separated upstream " of the first<br>
chopping assembly between two separating means,<br>
-	the strands are brought closer together between the<br>
two separating means,<br>
-	the strand is guided as the chassis rotates about its<br>
axle, this guidance being performed by guide means<br>
secured to said chassis,<br>
-	said chassis is always set in motion in the same<br>
direction,<br>
 <br>
- said chassis is set in rotation about a vertical<br>
axis .<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the<br>
latter is aimed at a chopping machine intended for the<br>
manufacture of chopped strands for technical use,<br>
particularly strands of thermoplastic and especially<br>
glass strands, said machine comprising a three-<br>
dimensional chassis having three sides or more, a first<br>
chopping assembly secured to one of the sides of said<br>
chassis comprising a chopping wheel and an anvil wheel,<br>
a second chopping assembly comprising a chopping wheel<br>
and an anvil wheel, said second chopping assembly being<br>
secured to one of the other sides of said chassis, said<br>
chassis being mounted so that it can move on an<br>
articulation axle, particularly an axle of rotation,<br>
characterized in that the chassis comprises guide means<br>
for guiding the strand which are designed to guide the<br>
strand in its path between the first chopping assembly<br>
and the second chopping assembly when said chassis is<br>
moved about its axle.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
recourse may also potentially be had to one and/or<br>
other of the following arrangements:<br>
the chassis is set in rotation about a vertical<br>
axis,<br>
the chassis is a cube or a rectangular polyhedron,<br>
the first chopping assembly and the second<br>
chopping assembly are positioned one on each side<br>
of an axis of symmetry of the chassis,<br>
the first chopping assembly and the second<br>
chopping assembly are positioned respectively on<br>
adjacent sides of said chassis,<br>
the first chopping assembly and the second<br>
chopping assembly are positioned respectively on<br>
parallel sides of said chassis,<br>
 <br>
the guide means are positioned upstream and<br>
downstream of the first and/or second chopping<br>
assemblies,<br>
the guide means comprise rolls mounted so that<br>
they can move about a more or less vertical axis.<br>
Other characteristics, details and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become better apparent from<br>
reading the description that will follow, given by way<br>
of entirely nonlimiting illustration with reference to<br>
the attached drawings in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a simplified overall schematic view of an<br>
installation incorporating a chopping machine<br>
according to the invention, and<br>
-	figures 2 to 8 illustrate the various steps in the<br>
process aimed at changing the chopping members,<br>
according to the procedures of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 therefore schematically shows an installation<br>
for producing chopped strands which comprises at least<br>
one bushing 1 fed, in the known way, with molten glass<br>
or glass beads delivered by a feed device, not<br>
depicted. These bushings, for example made of a<br>
platinum-rhodium alloy, are usually heated by<br>
resistance heating. They are provided on their<br>
underside with a plurality of orifices from which a<br>
plurality of filaments 2 (here some of them are<br>
depicted in chain line) can be mechanically drawn.<br>
The filaments 2 generally undergo a sizing operation,<br>
that is to say a chemical treatment designed to apply<br>
to them a product that provides the strand with<br>
cohesion and sufficient lubrication and a capability to<br>
be subsequently used, in terms of processability and<br>
reinforcement/matrix compatibility, by means of a size<br>
applicator roller 3.<br>
The filaments coming from a bushing are then combined<br>
by assembling rollers 4 into at least one strand 5<br>
 <br>
which is turned, via means such as a deflection or turn<br>
roll 6, so as to send them to a chopping machine 7<br>
Ideated downstream of the bushing 1 assembly.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of the main components of<br>
the installation illustrated in figure 1 is such that<br>
the path of the filaments 2 then of the strands 5 lies<br>
generally in a vertical plane, from the bushing as far<br>
as the chopping machine 7. More specifically, the<br>
filaments 2 lie firstly in an approximately vertical<br>
direction from the bushing to the deflection or turn<br>
roll 6, then the strands 5 follow a more or less<br>
horizontal path until they enter the chopping machine<br>
7. A tensioning roll 10 may be provided at the entry to<br>
the machine so as to ensure that the strands are<br>
wrapped around the anvil wheel over a sufficiently<br>
large arc to drive said strands by the friction force.<br>
The bushing 1 and the size applicator roller 3 are<br>
placed one above the other, for example in one and the<br>
same fiberizing cell which stands on the floor on which<br>
the chopping machine stands.<br>
The turn roll 6 lies vertically in line with the size<br>
applicator roller 3. An opening made in the floor<br>
allows the bundle of filaments to pass downstream of<br>
the size applicator roller. This opening may also allow<br>
the fibers to be removed in the event of bushing<br>
breaks.<br>
Thus, the filaments 2 follow a more or less vertical<br>
path from the bushing 1 to the turn roll 6 which<br>
deflects the strands through about 90° to bring them<br>
horizontally (or more or less horizontally) to the<br>
chopping machine 7.<br>
The chopping machine 7 firstly comprises a blade-<br>
carrying wheel 8 (or chopping wheel) and an anvil wheel<br>
9. Details about the construction of these wheels are<br>
 <br>
given in the prior literature, particularly in<br>
publication EP 0 040 145. The chopping and anvil wheels<br>
are in contact with one another under slight pressure<br>
so that in the region of contact, which is also the<br>
chopping region, the deformation of the elastomer<br>
results in the blades of the blade-carrying wheel being<br>
flush. In practice, just one of the two wheels is<br>
driven, the other being driven upon contact therewith.<br>
As a preference, it is the blade-carrying wheel that is<br>
driven. The drive is conveyed by means of an electric<br>
motor, preferably with a direct drive via the hub of<br>
the wheel concerned.<br>
The chopped strands 11 are collected in a receiving<br>
device 12. During the gaps in the chopping operation,<br>
particularly when a bushing is restarted, the strands<br>
are drawn by a drawing system 23, usually called a<br>
strand puller (cf. figure 1). The strands have to be<br>
drawn before the chopping operation begins or when a<br>
bushing is being restarted in order to establish<br>
steady-state operation of the bushing and therefore<br>
guarantee well-defined strand quality.<br>
Under running conditions, the chopping machine 7 of<br>
which either the anvil 8 and/or the blade-carrying<br>
wheel 8 is motorized, pulls on the strands.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the chopping<br>
machine visible in figure 1 is in fact a multi-head<br>
chopping machine. Figures 2 to 8 are views from above<br>
of this chopping machine at various stages in the<br>
operating cycle. The multi-head chopping machine<br>
comprises at least two chopping assemblies (a first one<br>
CI and a second one C2) which are separate and mounted<br>
on a chassis, the chassis being able to move in<br>
rotation about an axle 24 secured to a base positioned<br>
on the floor of the installation, this rotation axle 24<br>
preferably being a vertical axle.<br>
 <br>
As a preference, the chassis can be inscribed within a<br>
cube or, more generally, within a rectangular<br>
polyhedron, and the chopping assemblies CI, C2 are<br>
positioned along an axis of symmetry of this chassis<br>
(in the example depicted, the axis of symmetry is the<br>
rotation spindle). In the example depicted in figure 2,<br>
each chopping assembly CI, C2 is positioned<br>
respectively on two sides or two parallel faces of the<br>
chassis. As an alternative (not depicted in the<br>
figures), the first and second chopping assemblies CI,<br>
C2 are positioned on adjacent sides of the chopping<br>
machine 7 .<br>
As can be seen in figure 2, a web of strands 5 from a<br>
bushing 1 or part of a bushing is drawn then chopped by<br>
a first chopping assembly CI, the strands 5 passing<br>
between the chopping wheel 8 and the anvil wheel 9 of<br>
this first chopping assembly CI which is in the<br>
production position, these strands being guided from<br>
the deflection wheel 6 to the first chopping assembly<br>
CI by a first separator 22. As can be seen in figure 2,<br>
the first separator 22 allows the strands 5 to be<br>
separated from one another and prevent them from<br>
occasioning chopping defects as they pass between the<br>
chopping wheel 8 and the anvil wheel 9.<br>
When the chopping quality deteriorates, then the<br>
chopping members need to be changed using procedures<br>
that will be explained in detail hereinafter.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a transient phase prior to the<br>
changing of the chopping tools.<br>
This figure 3 depicts a second separator 25 identical<br>
to the previous one. This second separator 25 is on<br>
standby and disengaged. It does not interfere with the<br>
path of the strands 5 exiting the bushings ].<br>
 <br>
Initially positioned upstream of the first separator 22<br>
(position identified as A in figure 3), the second<br>
separator 25 is brought closer to the first separator<br>
22 (position identified as B in figure 3) either<br>
manually or in a motorized manner (it may for example<br>
be mounted on an actuator), this approach movement<br>
(A, B) (in fact the separator 25 adopts a position B<br>
just ahead of the position occupied by the separator<br>
22) is illustrated by an arrow fl. When the second<br>
separator 25 is in the upstream vicinity of the first<br>
separator 22 it is then engaged and interferes with the<br>
path of the strands 5. In figure 4, the second<br>
separator 25 moves away from the first separator 22 and<br>
returns to the position A it initially occupied (this<br>
movement is depicted by an arrow f2) in figure 3,<br>
although the second separator 25 remains engaged with<br>
the path of the strands 5 the same is true of the first<br>
separator 22.<br>
In this configuration, the chopping machine 7 will be<br>
able to effect a rotational movement about its axle 24<br>
as follows (reference may be made to the sequence in<br>
figures 5-6-7-8). This rotation is performed in a known<br>
way, by any hydraulic, electrical, or pneumatic<br>
actuator, or manually if need be.<br>
As can be seen from figure 5, before rotating the<br>
chopping machine 7 about its vertical rotation axle 24,<br>
two gathering means 26, 26' are simultaneously brought<br>
together, so as to collect or gather together the<br>
strands 5 running between the first separator 22 and<br>
the second - separator 25, this brmging-together of the<br>
gathering means 26, 26' is illustrated by the arrows f3<br>
(between a separated position illustrated in dotted<br>
line and a gathered-together position illustrated in<br>
solid line).<br>
These gathering means 26 secured to the chassis consist<br>
for example of a roller or roll in the shape of a<br>
 <br>
diabolo mounted so that it can move in terms of<br>
rotation on a vertical axle.<br>
The gathering means 26' situated in close proximity to<br>
the second separator 25 also constitutes a guide means<br>
situated upstream of the first chopping assembly CI,<br>
the path of the strand coming flush with the external<br>
surface of the roller.<br>
Other guide means 27, 28, 29 identical to the previous<br>
ones are positioned, as can be seen from figure 5,<br>
downstream of the first chopping assembly CI and<br>
upstream and downstream of the second chopping assembly<br>
C2, namely more or less at each of the corners of the<br>
chopping machine 7.<br>
In figure 6, as the chopping machine 7 is rotated, the<br>
guide means 26, 27, 28, 29 (the rollers) each in turn<br>
take over the guidance of the strands 5, these<br>
continuing to be chopped by the first chopping assembly<br>
CI.<br>
In figure 7, the chopping machine 7 has completely<br>
rotated about its rotation axle 24. The first chopping<br>
assembly CI has taken the place of the second chopping<br>
assembly C2 and vice versa. The first chopping assembly<br>
CI throughout the rotation of the chopping machine 7 is<br>
kept in operation and therefore continued to draw the<br>
strands 5 during the rotation process, these strands 5<br>
also, furthermore, simultaneously being chopped and<br>
collected under the chopping machine 7.<br>
The next step is to bring the second chopping assembly<br>
C2 into operation and automatically restart the strands<br>
on the second chopping assembJy C2. This automatic<br>
restart phase is covered by a parallel patent<br>
application FR 04/52285 filed on October 07, 2004 by<br>
the applicant company and to which reference should be<br>
made.<br>
 <br>
Figure 8 depicts the installation after this automatic<br>
restart phase.<br>
It will be noted that the strands 5 are now drawn and<br>
chopped by the second chopping assembly C2 and that the<br>
strands 5 are correctly separated, the gathering means<br>
26, 26' having returned to their rest position, the<br>
position that they occupied in figure 5.<br>
The first chopping assembly CI can then be taken out of<br>
operation so that a maintenance operation can be<br>
performed on it, it being possible for this for example<br>
to consist of a change of chopping members (anvil wheel<br>
and/or chopping wheel).<br>
As has been seen, the various steps m this process<br>
guarantee thai: work can be performed on the chopping<br>
machine without having to interrupt the production of<br>
the strands from the bushings, something that was not<br>
possible with double-head chopping machines known from<br>
the prior art, even the latter requiring some degree of<br>
scrapping while the machine was being rotated.<br>
It goes without saying that the invention as previously<br>
described has been illustrated on the basis of a mode<br>
of operation that includes rotating the chopping<br>
machine about one of its axes of symmetry (in this<br>
instance a vertical rotation axle). It will therefore<br>
be understood that this invention also comprises modes<br>
of operation whereby the rotation about an axis can be<br>
broken down into a combination of elementary movements<br>
including translational movements, rotational movements<br>
during which the strand(s) from the bushings will pass<br>
without breakage from a first chopping assembly to a<br>
second chopping assembly, amounting to a mode of<br>
operation equivalent to the one illustrated by figures<br>
2 to 8. Thus, in a variant embodiment, the chopping<br>
machine may perform a circuit in the shape of a square.<br>
 <br>
According to yet another variant embodiment, the<br>
chopping machine equipped with these two chopping<br>
assemblies is placed on a runway track along which it<br>
can move as far as a turntable designed to allow it to<br>
make a half-turn, so as to switch the first chopping<br>
assembly from an operating position to a maintenance<br>
position and vice versa in respect of the second<br>
chopping assembly (which is switched from a maintenance<br>
position to an operating position). Once the half-turn<br>
has been effected, the chopping machine, by moving in<br>
the opposite direction along the runway track, returns<br>
to its initial position.<br>
Furthermore, the automatic switchover of the strands<br>
from a first chopping assembly to a second chopping<br>
assembly without the need to interrupt production or,<br>
more precisely, without the need to send the production<br>
for scrap, is highly economical in terms of human<br>
intervention: in theory, all of the steps can be<br>
managed by a single operator, something which was not<br>
the case with double-head chopping machines known from<br>
the prior art. The strands chopped during this<br>
maintenance phase can be collected and used for profit.<br>
