ENDOSCOPIC TRANSLUMENAL SURGICAL SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods and devices for endoscopic translumenal<br>
surgery.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Endoscopic surgery can be used to access the abdominal cavity via natural openings<br>
(mouth, anus, vagina, urethra) of the body and through the peritoneal lining of the abdominal<br>
cavity. Obviously, the size and shape of instruments that may be passed through a bodily lumen<br>
in order to perform a medical procedure in the abdominal cavity are greatly restricted due to the<br>
anatomical properties of the lumen. General surgeons, gastroenterologists, and other medical<br>
specialists, routinely use flexible endoscopes for intraluminal (within the lumen of the alimentary<br>
canal) examination and treatment of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, via the mouth, and the<br>
lower GI tract, via the anus. In these procedures, the physician pushes the flexible endoscope<br>
into the lumen, periodically pausing to articulate the distal end of the endoscope using external<br>
control knobs, to redirect the distal tip of the endoscope. In this way, the physician may navigate<br>
the crooked passageway of the upper GI past the pharynx, through the esophagus and gastro<br>
esophageal junction, and into the stomach. The physician must take great care not to injure the<br>
delicate mucosal lining of the lumen, which generally may stretch open to a diameter in the<br>
range of about 15-25 mm, but normally has a non-circular cross sectional configuration when<br>
relaxed.<br>
[0003] During such translumenal procedures, a puncture must be formed in the stomach wall or<br>
in the gastrointestinal tract to access the peritoneal cavity. One device often used to form such a<br>
puncture is a needle knife which is inserted through the working channel of the endoscope, and<br>
which utilizes energy to penetrate through the tissue. A guidewire is then feed through the<br>
endoscope and is passed through the puncture in the stomach wall and into the peritoneal cavity.<br>
The needle knife is removed, leaving the guidewire as a placeholder. A balloon catheter is then<br>
passed over the guidewire and through the working channel of the endoscope to position the<br>
balloon within the opening in the stomach wall. The balloon can then be inflated to increase the<br>
size of the opening, thereby enabling the endoscope to push against the rear of the balloon and to<br>
-1-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
be feed through the opening and into the peritoneal cavity. Once the endoscope is positioned<br>
within the peritoneal cavity, numerous procedures can be performed through the working<br>
channel of the endoscope.<br>
[0004] While current methods and devices used to penetrate tissue are effective, one drawback is<br>
that several exchanges and steps are required to form the opening. The small size of the opening<br>
formed can also create high resistance to advancing or retracting the endoscope, which is<br>
significantly larger than the opening. In the event the endoscope is retracted through the<br>
opening, it can also be difficult to locate the opening and re-insert the endoscope. Continued<br>
advancement and retraction of the endoscope can also be uncomfortable for the patient. Another<br>
drawback of current methods is that a non-sterile passageway is created from the stomach into<br>
the abdominal cavity, as the devices carry bacteria from the body lumen into the abdominal<br>
cavity.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, there remains a need for improved endoscopic translumenal methods and<br>
devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention provides various methods and devices for use in endoscopic<br>
surgery. In one embodiment, a translumenal trocar device is provided and includes an elongate<br>
flexible trocar sleeve having an inner lumen extending therethrough, and an elongate flexible<br>
obturator disposed through the trocar sleeve. The obturator has an inner lumen extending<br>
therethrough and sized to receive an endoscope therein, and a distal tip located at a distal end of<br>
the obturator and shaped to penetrate and guide the obturator and trocar sleeve through tissue to<br>
thereby insert an endoscope through tissue. At least one of the flexible trocar sleeve and the<br>
elongate flexible obturator can include at least two regions of differing rigidity to facilitate<br>
positioning translumenally.<br>
[0007] The distal tip of the obturator can have a variety of configurations. In one embodiment,<br>
at least a portion of the distal tip is transparent. The distal tip can also have various shapes, for<br>
example it can have a generally conical shape. The distal tip can also include at least one cutting<br>
element for facilitating penetration thereof through tissue. The cutting element can be, for<br>
example, at least one blade formed on an outer surface of the distal tip and having a sharp, linear<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
edge. In another embodiment, the distal tip can include at least one paddle extending outward<br>
from an outer surface of the distal tip and configured to be rotated to separate tissue. The tip can<br>
also include other features such as a bore formed therein for receiving a tissue cutting element<br>
therethrough.<br>
[0008] The trocar sleeve can also have a variety of configurations. In one embodiment, the<br>
trocar sleeve can include at least one seal disposed therein which permits the passage of the<br>
obturator through the trocar sleeve while limiting or preventing the passage of fluid or gas<br>
therethrough. The seal can be disposed within a housing located at a proximal end of the trocar<br>
sleeve. The trocar sleeve can, in other embodiments, include a tapered distal portion that forms a<br>
smooth transition between the trocar sleeve and the distal tip of the obturator.<br>
[0009] A translumenal introducer kit is also provided and includes an elongate flexible obturator<br>
disposable over an endoscope and having a distal tip located on a distal end thereof for seating<br>
the distal end of an endoscope to allow an image gathering unit on the endoscope to gather an<br>
image viewed through the distal tip. The distal tip can be shaped to penetrate through tissue.<br>
The kit can also include an elongate flexible trocar sleeve disposable over the obturator such that<br>
the obturator extends distally beyond a distal end of the trocar sleeve to guide the trocar sleeve<br>
through tissue being penetrated. In other embodiments, the kit can include an endoscope<br>
disposed through the elongate flexible obturator and having an optical image gathering unit at a<br>
distal end thereof.<br>
[0010] A method for accessing a body cavity is also provided, and in one exemplary<br>
embodiment the method includes guiding an endoscope translumenally through a patient's body<br>
to position a distal end of the endoscope adjacent to tissue to be penetrated. A proximal end of<br>
the endoscope can remain outside of the patient's body. A distal tip located at the distal end of<br>
the endoscope is advanced through the tissue to guide the distal end of the endoscope through the<br>
tissue and into a body cavity. The endoscope and the distal tip can then be removed from a<br>
flexible trocar sleeve disposed around the endoscope such that the flexible trocar sleeve forms a<br>
working channel that extends from outside of the patient's body, translumenally, through the<br>
tissue, and into the body cavity. In one embodiment, the distal tip can be formed on a distal end<br>
of an obturator disposed around the endoscope and within the flexible trocar sleeve. After<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
removing the endoscope, the endoscope can be removed from the obturator and inserted back<br>
into the flexible trocar sleeve. The method can also include, prior to advancing a distal tip<br>
through tissue, inserting a tissue cutting element through the endoscope and through a bore<br>
formed in the distal tip, and cutting the tissue with the cutting element. The endoscope and the<br>
distal tip can be guided translumenally through the tissue using an image of an area surrounding<br>
the distal end of the endoscope. The image can be gathered by an image gathering unit disposed<br>
within the distal end of the endoscope.<br>
[0011] In another embodiment, an endoscope insertion assembly device is provided and includes<br>
an elongate flexible trocar sleeve having an inner lumen extending therethrough for<br>
longitudinally receiving an endoscope therein, and an end cap positionable within a distal end of<br>
the trocar sleeve and shaped to penetrate and guide the trocar sleeve through tissue. The end cap<br>
can removably disposable over a distal end of an endoscope, and in one embodiment at least a<br>
portion of the end cap is transparent to allow images to be viewed therethrough.<br>
[0012] While the particular configuration of the end cap can vary, in one exemplary embodiment<br>
the end cap includes a portion adapted to be disposed over an endoscope, and a distal portion<br>
extending from the proximal portion and forming a viewing window to allow images to be<br>
viewed therethrough. The proximal portion can be formed from various materials, such as a<br>
resilient material to facilitate engagement with an endoscope. The distal portion can include a<br>
substantially planar region for facilitating viewing therethrough, or in other embodiments the<br>
distal portion can be in the shape of a parabola for facilitating viewing therethrough. The end<br>
cap can also include other features, such as a bore formed in the distal portion for receiving an<br>
endoscopic accessory, and/or one or more blades formed thereon for cutting tissue. The blade(s)<br>
can optionally be coupled to an energy source, such as an electrosurgical generator, an ultrasonic<br>
generator, a laser, or a heat source.  In other embodiments, the end cap can includes at least one<br>
paddle extending outward from an outer surface of the end cap and configured to be rotated to<br>
separate tissue<br>
[0013] The trocar sleeve can also have a variety of configurations. In one embodiment, the<br>
trocar sleeve can include a tapered distal portion that tapers toward an outer surface of the end<br>
cap to form a substantially continuous outer surface with the end cap. The trocar sleeve can also<br>
-4-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
optionally include at least one seal disposed therein which permits the passage of the end cap and<br>
an endoscope coupled to the end cap while limiting or preventing the passage of fluid or gas<br>
therethrough.<br>
[0014] In other aspects, an endoscopic insertion device is provided and includes an end cap<br>
having a proximal housing configured to be removably disposed over a distal end of an<br>
endoscope, and a distal housing shaped to be inserted through tissue. At least a portion of the<br>
distal housing of the end cap can be transparent to allow an optical image gathering unit in an<br>
endoscope to view and gather and image therethrough. The proximal housing can have various<br>
configurations that allow it to mate to an endoscope. For example, the proximal housing can be<br>
formed from a resilient material to facilitate engagement with an endoscope. The distal housing<br>
can also have various configurations. In one embodiment, the distal housing can include a<br>
substantially planar region to facilitate viewing therethrough. In another embodiment, the distal<br>
housing can be in the shape of a parabola for facilitating viewing therethrough. The distal<br>
housing can also include other features, such as at least one blade formed thereon for cutting<br>
tissue, and/or a bore formed therethrough for receiving an endoscopic accessory.<br>
[0015] In yet another embodiment, a translumenal introducer kit is provided and includes a<br>
plurality of end caps, each end cap including a proximal portion removably disposable over a<br>
distal end of an endoscope, and a distal portion configured to be inserted through tissue. The end<br>
caps can be the same, or they have different sizes and/or configurations.<br>
[0016] In another embodiment, a method for accessing a body cavity is provided and includes<br>
guiding a distal portion of an endoscope to position an end cap disposed on a distal end of the<br>
endoscope adjacent to tissue to be penetrated, and advancing the end cap through the tissue to<br>
guide the distal end of the endoscope through the tissue and into a body cavity. An image of an<br>
area surrounding the distal end of the endoscope can be used to guide the endoscope<br>
translumenally and to advance the end cap through the tissue. The image can be gathered by an<br>
image gathering unit disposed within the distal end of the endoscope. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, the endoscope is guided over an endoscopic accessory pre-disposed through the<br>
tissue and the end cap is advanced over the endoscopic accessory and expands the tissue as it<br>
passes therethrough. The method can also include removing the endoscope and the end cap from<br>
-5-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
a flexible trocar sleeve disposed around the endoscope such that the flexible trocar sleeve forms<br>
a working channel that extends from outside of the patient's body, translumenally, through the<br>
tissue, and into the body cavity. After removing the endoscope with the end cap from a flexible<br>
trocar sleeve, the end cap can be removed from the endoscope and the endoscope can be re-<br>
inserted into the flexible trocar sleeve. In yet another embodiment, prior to advancing the end<br>
cap through tissue, an endoscopic accessory can be inserted through the endoscope and through a<br>
bore formed in the end cap, and it can be used to cut the tissue.<br>
[0017] In yet another embodiment, a method for introducing an endoscopic device is provided<br>
and includes positioning a proximal end of a flexible sheath in proximity to an opening of a body<br>
lumen, attaching a distal end of the flexible sheath to an endoscopic device, advancing a portion<br>
of the sheath through the body lumen while the proximal and distal ends of the sheath remain in<br>
proximity to the opening of the body lumen, and advancing the endoscopic device with the distal<br>
end of the sheath attached thereto through the body lumen. The flexible sheath forms a barrier<br>
between the endoscopic device and the body lumen.<br>
[0018] In one embodiment, advancing a portion of the sheath can include advancing at least one<br>
support rod between the proximal and distal ends of the sheath to advance a portion of the sheath<br>
into the body lumen. The body lumen can be, for example, an esophagus and the proximal end<br>
of the sheath can be disposed in an oral cavity at the opening of the esophagus. The portion of<br>
the sheath that is advanced translumenally can thus be advanced into a patient's stomach. The<br>
sheath will thus prevent direct contact between the endoscopic device and the esophagus. The<br>
method can also include positioning a distal end of the endoscopic device within a patient's<br>
stomach, inserting an endoscopic accessory through the endoscopic device, and using the<br>
endoscopic accessory to form a puncture hole in the stomach to access the patient's abdominal<br>
cavity. The endoscopic accessory can be, for example, a flexible trocar having a transparent<br>
distal tip shaped to penetrate and guide the flexible trocar sleeve through tissue to thereby insert<br>
the endoscopic device through tissue.<br>
[0019] In another exemplary method for introducing an endoscopic device, a mid-portion of a<br>
sheath can be advanced through a body lumen and into a stomach cavity. The sheath can have<br>
proximal and distal ends that remain external to the body lumen while the mid-portion of the<br>
-6-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
sheath is being advanced. An endoscopic device, with the distal end of the sheath coupled<br>
thereto, can then be advanced through the sheath to position a distal end of the endoscopic device<br>
within the stomach cavity. The sheath will prevent contact between the body cavity and the<br>
endoscopic device. In certain exemplary embodiments, advancing a mid-portion of the sheath<br>
can include advancing at least one support rod between the proximal and distal ends of the sheath<br>
to advance the mid-portion of the sheath into the body lumen.<br>
[0020] An endoscopic insertion system is also provided, and includes an endoscopic device<br>
configured to be introduced translumenally, and an elongate flexible sheath having proximal and<br>
distal ends with an inner lumen extending therethrough and configured to receive the endoscopic<br>
device. The proximal end of the flexible sheath can have a shape adapted to be disposed within a<br>
patient's mouth, and the distal end of the flexible sheath can be configured to mate to the<br>
endoscopic device. The system can also include at least one support rod adapted to advance a<br>
portion of the flexible sheath into a body lumen.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0038] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices<br>
and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the<br>
-8-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the devices and<br>
methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-<br>
limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by<br>
the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment<br>
may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0039] The present invention generally provides methods and devices for performing<br>
translumenal (e.g., transoral and transanal) procedures. In general, the methods and devices<br>
utilize a trocar assembly or trocar end cap that can facilitate insertion of an endoscope through<br>
tissue. In one embodiment, a flexible trocar assembly is provided for insertion through a body<br>
lumen. The trocar assembly can include an obturator having an inner lumen formed<br>
therethrough for receiving an endoscope therein, and a distal end that is adapted to facilitate<br>
insertion of the endoscope through tissue. The trocar assembly can also include a trocar sleeve<br>
that is disposable over the obturator. In use, once the trocar assembly is inserted through tissue,<br>
the trocar sleeve can function as a placeholder, allowing the endoscope and obturator to be<br>
removed. The endoscope can then be removed from within the obturator and reinserted through<br>
the trocar sleeve for use in performing various other procedures. In other embodiments, rather<br>
than using a trocar that houses the endoscope, an end cap can be removably disposed over a<br>
distal end of the endoscope. The endoscope and end cap can optionally be inserted through the<br>
elongate flexible trocar sleeve, and the assembly can be used to insert the endoscope through<br>
tissue. The sleeve can again function as a place holder after the assembly is inserted through<br>
tissue, thereby allowing the endoscope to be removed from the sleeve and the end cap to be<br>
removed from the endoscope. The endoscope can then be reinserted through the sleeve and<br>
thereby positioned through the puncture hole. The present invention also provides various<br>
techniques for inserting a flexible trocar assembly or end cap through tissue. In one<br>
embodiment, one or more blades can be formed on the obturator or end cap to allow the<br>
obturator or end cap to penetrate through the tissue. In another embodiment, the obturator or end<br>
cap can be configured to receive an endoscopic accessory, such as a needle knife, therethrough to<br>
allow the endoscopic accessory to penetrate through or cut the tissue. The obturator or end cap<br>
can then be guided over the endoscopic accessory and through the tissue, to thereby position the<br>
endoscope through the tissue. The present invention also provides methods and devices for<br>
-9-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
shielding an endoscope during insertion through a body lumen, and in particular for preventing<br>
contact between the endoscope (or trocar sleeve) and the body lumen, thus preventing bacteria<br>
from being carried into a body cavity.<br>
[0040] FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a flexible trocar assembly 10 for<br>
use in advancing an endoscope translumenally and through tissue to introduce the endoscope into<br>
a body cavity, such as the abdominal cavity. As shown, the flexible trocar assembly 10 generally<br>
includes an obturator 20 having an inner lumen extending therethrough for receiving or housing<br>
an endoscope, and having a distal end 22b configured to facilitate insertion of the endoscope<br>
through tissue. The flexible trocar assembly 10 can also include an outer trocar sleeve 30 that is<br>
slidably disposed over the obturator 20, and that can function as a placeholder after the device 10<br>
is inserted through tissue, as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0041] The obturator 20 is shown in more detail in FIG. IB, and as shown the obturator 20<br>
includes a hollow, elongate flexible shaft 22 having a proximal end 22a that is coupled to a<br>
housing 24 and a distal end 22b with a tip 26 that is adapted to be inserted through tissue. The<br>
size of the shaft 22 can vary, but it preferably has a length that allows it to be inserted<br>
translumenally, such as through a patient's esophagus, and it preferably has a diameter that<br>
allows an endoscope to be received therein. The shaft 22 can be made flexible using various<br>
techniques. For example, the shaft 22 can be formed from a flexible material, and/or it can<br>
include one or more features formed therein to facilitate flexible, such as a plurality of cut-outs<br>
or slots. In other embodiments, the shaft 22 can be formed from a plurality of linkages that are<br>
movably coupled to one another. The shaft 22 can also include regions that vary in flexibility.<br>
For example, certain portions of the shaft 22, such as the distal portion, can be more rigid than<br>
other portions of the shaft 22, such as the proximal portion, to correspond to the shape of a body<br>
lumen through which the shaft 22 is being inserted. This can be achieved by forming the shaft<br>
22 from different materials, varying the diameter or thickness of the shaft 22, or using various<br>
other techniques know in the art. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the shaft 22 can<br>
have virtually any configuration that allows the shaft 22 to flex as it is inserted through a<br>
tortuous body lumen. The shaft 22 can also include other features to facilitate use, such as one or<br>
more spiral wires embedded therein and configuration to preventing kinking of the shaft 22.<br>

[0042] The housing 24 coupled to or formed on the proximal end 22a of the shaft 22 can have a<br>
variety of configurations, but in an exemplary embodiment the housing 24 is provided to allow<br>
the obturator 20 to removably mate to the trocar sleeve 30. For example, the housing 24 can<br>
include one or more mating elements to mate the housing 24 to a housing 34 formed on the<br>
trocar sleeve 30, as will be discussed in more detail below. While virtually any mating technique<br>
can be used, in the illustrated embodiment the housing 24 on the obturator 20 includes first and<br>
second tabs (only one tab 25 is shown) that extend distally from a distal surface of the housing<br>
24. The tabs are configured to extend into corresponding bores formed in the housing 34 on the<br>
trocar sleeve 30. The tabs can also include protrusions formed adjacent to a terminal end thereof<br>
to allow the tabs to be engaged by an engagement mechanism formed within the bores, thereby<br>
fixedly mating the housing 24 on the obturator 20 to the housing 34 on the trocar sleeve 30. A<br>
release mechanism can be used to release the obturator 20 from the trocar sleeve 30. As shown<br>
in FIG. IB, the first and second tabs are coupled to deflectable members (only one tab 25 and<br>
one deflectable member 27 is shown) that extend from opposed lateral sides of the housing 24.<br>
The deflectable members can be depressed to cause the tabs to move, thereby releasing the tabs<br>
from the engaging mechanism formed in the bores in the trocar sleeve 30. The housing 24 also<br>
preferably includes a lumen (not shown) formed therethrough for receiving an endoscope to<br>
allow the endoscope to be advanced into the obturator 20. A person skilled in the other will<br>
appreciate that various other techniques can be used to mate the housing 24 of the obturator 20 to<br>
the housing 34 of the trocar sleeve 30, including twist-lock mechanisms, threads, snap-fit,<br>
interference fit, etc. While not shown, an opening formed in the proximal-most end of the<br>
housing 24 can optionally include a seal disposed therein and effective to engage an outer<br>
surface of the endoscope to seal the endoscope with respect to the obturator 20. The seal is<br>
particularly useful during insufflation as it can prevent gases from escaping through the<br>
assembly. In particular, the seal can permit the passage of the obturator 20 and endoscope<br>
through the trocar sleeve 30 while limiting or preventing the passage of fluid or gas therethrough.<br>
A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the housing can include various other features<br>
known in the art, and that the housing can have virtually any shape and size. The obturator 20<br>
also does not need to include a housing, but rather can merely be an elongate shaft that is<br>
slidably disposable over and endoscope and through a trocar sleeve.<br>
[0043] The tip 26 on the distal end 22b of the elongate shaft 22 of the obturator 20 can also have<br>
-11-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (ENDS844USNP)<br>
a variety of configurations, and various exemplary configurations for the tip will be discussed in<br>
more detail below with respect to FIGS. 3A-5.<br>
[0044] As indicated above, the flexible trocar assembly 10 can also include a trocar sleeve 30,<br>
which is shown in more detail in FIG. 1C. While the trocar sleeve 30 can have virtually any<br>
configuration, it preferably includes a hollow, elongate flexible shaft 32 that is configured to be<br>
slidably disposed over the obturator 20. The size of the flexible shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30<br>
can vary, but it preferably has a length that is slightly less then a length of the shaft 22 of the<br>
obturator 20 such that the tip 26 of the obturator 20 extends distally beyond a distal end 32b of<br>
the elongate shaft 32. The diameter can also vary, but as indicated above, the diameter should be<br>
sufficient to allow the elongate shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30 to receive the elongate shaft 22 of<br>
the obturator 20 therein. The elongate shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30 can be made flexible using<br>
various techniques known in the art, including those previously discussed with respect to the<br>
elongate shaft 22 of the obturator 20. In an exemplary embodiment, the trocar sleeve 30 is a<br>
flexible sleeve having a coiled wire wrapped there around or embedded therein to prevent<br>
kinking, and having a slipping interior lining to facilitate smooth passage of the obturator 20<br>
therethrough. The elongate shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30 can also include regions that vary in<br>
flexibility, as was also discussed above with respect to the elongate shaft 22 of the obturator 20.<br>
[0045] The trocar sleeve 30 can also include other features to facilitate use of the trocar sleeve<br>
30 with the obturator 20. For example, the distal end 32b of the trocar sleeve 30 can have an<br>
outer diameter that tapers distally, as shown, to form a substantially smooth continuous transition<br>
from the trocar sleeve 30 to the tip 26 of the obturator 20. The distal end 32b can also be angled<br>
as shown, or it can have various other configurations. In other exemplary embodiments, the<br>
distal end 32b can be transparent to facilitate viewing therethrough. The trocar sleeve 30 can<br>
also including a housing 34 formed on or coupled to a proximal end 32a of the elongate shaft 32.<br>
The housing 34 can be configured to removably mate to the housing 24 of the obturator 20, and<br>
in particular the housing 34 can include a proximal end with first and second bores (not shown)<br>
formed thereon and configured to receive the tabs formed on the distal end of the housing 24 on<br>
the obturator 20, as previously explained. The housing 34 can also include an inner lumen (not<br>
shown) formed therethrough and coaxial with the lumen in the elongate shaft 32 to allow the<br>
elongate shaft 22 of the obturator 20 to be inserted through the housing 34 and into the elongate<br>
-12-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30. While not shown, one or more seals can be disposed within the<br>
lumen in the housing 34 to engage an outer surface of the shaft 22 of the obturator 20 to seal the<br>
shaft 22 of the obturator 20 with respect to the trocar sleeve housing 34. Various seal or valve<br>
mechanisms are known in the art, including duck bill or double duck bill valves, zero-closure<br>
valves, gaskets, etc. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the housing 34 can include<br>
various other features known in the art, and that the housing 34 can have virtually any shape and<br>
size. Alternatively, the trocar sleeve 30 does not need to include any housing and can merely be<br>
in the form of an elongate shaft which can optionally include a locking mechanism, such as a<br>
luer lock, for mating to and forming a seal about the obturator.<br>
[0046] In other embodiments, at least a portion of the elongate shaft 32 of the trocar sleeve 30<br>
can include a coating disposed thereon and configured to destroy any bacteria that comes into<br>
contact with the trocar sleeve 30 as the sleeve 30 is introduced translumenally. The coating can<br>
be, for example, an antimicrobial agent that is disposed along an external surface of the shaft 32<br>
of the trocar sleeve 30. Other techniques can also optionally be used to help prevent the spread<br>
of bacteria as the device is inserted translumenally and into a body cavity.<br>
[0047] In use, referring back to FIG. 1A, the obturator 20 can be inserted through and mated to<br>
the trocar sleeve 30 to form a flexible trocar assembly 10 that can be used to introduce an<br>
endoscope translumenally, and to position the endoscope through tissue and into a body lumen.<br>
In particular, an endoscope can be inserted into the opening in the proximal end of the housing<br>
24 of the obturator 20 to position the distal end of the endoscope within or at least proximally<br>
adjacent to the tip 26 of the obturator 20. The obturator 20 can be inserted through the opening<br>
in the housing 34 of the trocar sleeve 30, and the housing 24 on the obturator 20 can be mated to<br>
the housing 34 on the trocar sleeve 30. As a result, the tip 26 of the obturator 20 will extend<br>
distally beyond the distal end 32b of the trocar sleeve 30. Once the endoscope is inserted<br>
through the trocar assembly 10, at least the distal end of the assembly 10 can be inserted<br>
translumenally, e.g., transorally or transanally, through a body lumen, and it can be inserted<br>
through tissue to gain access to a body cavity. Exemplary methods for inserting the assembly<br>
translumenally and through tissue will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, rather than using an obturator 20 that houses the endoscope, an<br>
-13-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
end cap, having a configuration similar to the tip 26 at the distal end 22b of the obturator 20, can<br>
be removably mated to the distal end of the endoscope. This is illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2C,<br>
which show an end cap 40 removably mated to a distal end of an endoscope 50. The end cap 40<br>
and endoscope 50 can optionally be inserted through a trocar sleeve 60, as shown in FIGS. 2A<br>
and 2B, to form a trocar assembly 10' that is similar to the trocar assembly 10 previously<br>
described with respect to FIGS. 1A-1C. While not described in detail, the trocar sleeve 60,<br>
shown separately in FIG. 2B, can have a configuration that is similar to the trocar sleeve 30<br>
previously described with respect to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A-1C.<br>
[0049] The end cap 40 can have a variety of configurations, and various techniques can be used<br>
to mate the end cap 40 to the distal end of an endoscope 50. In one exemplary embodiment,<br>
shown in detail in FIG. 2C, the end cap 40 can have a substantially cylindrical proximal portion<br>
40a that can be slidably disposed over a substantially cylindrical distal end of the endoscope 50.<br>
The shape can, however, vary depending on the shape of the endoscope 50. The proximal<br>
portion 40a of the end cap 40 can also be configured to releasably engage the endoscope 50 to<br>
prevent the end cap 40 from disengaging with the endoscope 50 during use of the device. This<br>
can be achieved using, for example, a resilient material, an interference fit, a snap-fit, threads, or<br>
various other mating techniques known in the art. As further shown in FIG. 2C, the end cap 40<br>
can also include a distal tip portion 40b that can be configured to facilitate insertion of the<br>
endoscope 50 through tissue. The particular configuration of the distal tip 40b can vary, and<br>
various exemplary distal tips will be discussed in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 3A-5.<br>
[0050] In use, referring back to FIG. 2A, the end cap 40 can be mated to the distal end of the<br>
endoscope 50, and the endoscope 50 and end cap 40 can optionally be inserted through the trocar<br>
sleeve 60 to form a trocar assembly 10'. As previously explained with respect to the trocar<br>
sleeve 30 of FIG. 1C, the trocar sleeve 60 of FIG. 2A can include one or more seals disposed<br>
therein and effective to form a seal with the endoscope 50 inserted therethrough. As further<br>
shown in FIG. 2A, when the endoscope 50 is inserted through the trocar sleeve 60, the end cap<br>
40, or at least the tip portion 40b of the end cap 40, will extend distally beyond a distal-most end<br>
62b of the trocar sleeve 60 to allow the tip portion 40b of the end cap 40 to facilitate insertion of<br>
the assembly through tissue. The distal end 62b of the sleeve 60 can have various<br>
configurations, as previously explained, to allow the sleeve 60 and end cap 40 to fit together and<br>
-14-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (ENDS844USNP)<br>
have a substantially smooth continuous outer surface. Once the assembly is fully mated, at least<br>
the distal portion of the assembly can be inserted translumenally, e.g., transorally or transanally,<br>
through a body lumen, and it can be inserted through tissue to gain access to a body cavity.<br>
Exemplary methods for inserting the assembly translumenally and through tissue will be<br>
discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0051] As previously indicated, the tip 26 at the distal end of the obturator 20 or the tip 40b at<br>
the distal end of the end cap 40 can have a variety of configurations depending on the intended<br>
use. In an exemplary embodiment, at least a portion and more preferably all of the tip is<br>
transparent or clear to allow an image gathering unit at the distal end of the endoscope to view<br>
and gather images through the tip. This will allow the endoscope to be used to guide the<br>
assembly through a body lumen and through tissue. The particular configuration of the<br>
transparent portion can vary in order to further facilitate viewing through the tip. For example,<br>
the materials and shape can be optimized to provide a smooth, clear viewing surface through<br>
which the endoscope can view and gather images. In one exemplary embodiment, the tip can be<br>
shaped so that a region of the tip is relatively flat. This is illustrated in the embodiment shown in<br>
FIGS. 3A-3B, which illustrate an end cap 70 having a tip 72 with a distal-most region 74 that has<br>
a minimal curvature such that the region 74 is somewhat flattened. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 4A-4C, the tip 72 can taper distally and it can be in the shape of<br>
a parabola to prevent distortion of images gathered therethrough. The tip can also or<br>
alternatively be configured to enlarge an opening in tissue as the tip is advanced through the<br>
tissue. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the tip can have a variety of configurations<br>
to facilitate viewing therethrough.<br>
[0052] The particular configuration of the tip can also vary depending on the intended use of the<br>
tip. In one embodiment, the tip can have a configuration that allows the tip to cut and penetrate<br>
tissue through tissue. This can be achieved, for example, using one or more blades or cutting<br>
surfaces formed on the tip. FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate one embodiment of an end cap 80 having<br>
a tip 82 with first and second cutting blades 84a, 84b formed on opposed sides thereof and<br>
extending between proximal and distal ends of the tip 82. The cutting blades 84a, 84b protrude<br>
above the outer surface of the tip 82, and have sharp edges to cut through tissue. The cutting<br>
blades 84a, 84b can also be configured to couple to an energy source to facilitate cutting of<br>
-15-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
tissue. For example, a cautery wire can be coupled to the blades and it can extend through the<br>
endoscope attached to the end cap 80 to allow a proximal end of the wire to connect to an energy<br>
source. In another embodiment, the blades can be in the form of paddles that do not cut tissue,<br>
but rather merely extend outward from an outer surface of the tip. The paddles can have a<br>
generally planer, elongate configuration, and in use they can be configured to separate a cut or<br>
slit formed in tissue. For example, the paddles can be rotated to spread open an elongate cut<br>
made through tissue. The cutting blades can also be used to spread apart tissue, and/or to<br>
facilitate enlargement of a puncture hole formed through tissue. A person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the cutting blades can be formed integrally with the tip, such that the tip and<br>
blades are formed as a single piece of material, or they can be separate from and mated to the tip.<br>
As previously mentioned, the tip can also taper distally to facilitate insertion and penetration<br>
through tissue. As further shown in FIGS. 4A-4C, the tip 82 can also include other features such<br>
as a bore 86 formed in the distal-most end thereof and configured to receive an endoscopic<br>
accessory therethrough, such as a guide wire, or a cutting element such as a needle knife or<br>
sphinctertome. The assembly can be inserted translumenally along the endoscopic accessory, or<br>
the endoscopic accessory can be introduced into the device at various stages of a procedure.<br>
[0053] In another embodiment, rather than being configured to penetrate through tissue, the tip<br>
can be configured to facilitate insertion through the tissue and a separate endoscopic accessory<br>
can be used in coordination with the tip. For example, as previously described, FIGS. 3A-3B<br>
illustrate a tip 72 having a region 74 that is substantially planar. As further shown, the tip 72 can<br>
also include a protruding portion with a bore 76 formed therein for receiving an endoscopic<br>
accessory, such as a guide wire or a cutting tool, such as a needle knife or sphinctertome. The<br>
protruding portion 75 can be centrally located, but in an exemplary embodiment it is offset from<br>
a central axis of the endoscope so as to allow the protruding portion 75 to be positioned in axial<br>
alignment with a working channel of the endoscope, and to the allow the planar region 74 to be<br>
positioned in axial alignment with the viewing element in the endoscope. The protruding portion<br>
75 can also taper distally toward the bore 76 to facilitate insertion of the tip through tissue.<br>
[0054] FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of a tip 92, shown formed on the distal end of an<br>
obturator 90, that is preferably configured to be used in combination with an endoscopic<br>
accessory, such as a guide wire or a cutting tool, such as a needle knife or sphinctertome. In this<br>
-16-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
embodiment, the tip 92 has a generally conical configuration and tapers distally toward an<br>
opening or bore 96 formed in the distal-most end thereof. The bore 96 is co-axial with an axis of<br>
the endoscope, however since the tip 92 has an elongated length, any endoscopic accessory<br>
inserted through a working channel of the endoscope can move inward to be inserted through the<br>
bore 96.<br>
[0055] A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the tip of the obturator or the end cap can<br>
have a variety of other configurations, and the tips shown in the figures are merely exemplary<br>
embodiments of tip configurations. By way of non-limiting configuration, various other<br>
exemplary tip configurations are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,591,192 of Privitera et al. entitled<br>
"Surgical Penetration Instrument Including an Imagining Element, and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,569,292 of Scwemberger et al. entitled "Surgical Penetration Instrument With Transparent<br>
Blades and Tip Cover," which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The tip<br>
can also include other features. By way of non-limiting example, the tip can be configured to be<br>
energized to facilitate insertion and/or penetration of the tip through tissue.<br>
[0056] FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate one exemplary method for introducing an endoscope<br>
translumenally. The method is shown in conjunction with the device of FIGS. 1A-1C, however a<br>
person having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the device of FIGS. 2A-2C can be<br>
used, and that the device can have various other configurations, as previously described herein<br>
and as known in the art. In general, assembled device 10 is inserted translumenally, e.g.,<br>
transorally or transanally, to position the distal end of the assembly at a desired location at which<br>
tissue is to be penetrated. FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate the assembly inserted transorally through a<br>
patient's esophagus 100 to position the distal end of the device within the stomach 102, and to<br>
subsequently penetrate through the stomach wall to position the distal end within the abdominal<br>
cavity 104. The device 10 can optionally be guided through the body lumen using a steering<br>
mechanism on the endoscope 50, using a steering mechanism that is coupled to the trocar<br>
assembly, or using other techniques known in the art.<br>
[0057] Once the distal end of the trocar assembly 10 and endoscope 50 are positioned at the<br>
desired tissue penetration site, e.g., in the stomach 102, the tip 26 can be inserted through tissue.<br>
As previously explained, various techniques can be used to penetrate through the tissue. In the<br>
-17-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A-1C and FIGS. 6A-6B, the tip 26 of the obturator 20 includes<br>
cutting blades formed thereon that can cut through tissue, allowing the trocar assembly 10 to be<br>
directly penetrated through the tissue. The cutting blades can optionally be connected to an<br>
energy source to cauterize the tissue as the tip 26 is inserted therethrough. Where the tip 26 does<br>
not include cutting blades, such as the tip 72 shown in FIGS. 3A-3B, or in addition to the cutting<br>
blades, a cutting tool, such as a needle knife or sphinctertome, can be inserted through the<br>
working channel of the endoscope 50 and through the bore 76 in the tip 72. The needle knife or<br>
sphinctertome can then be energized to penetrate or cut through the tissue. The assembly can be<br>
guided over the needle knife or sphinctertome to guide the tip 72 through the puncture formed in<br>
the tissue by the needle knife, or alternatively the cutting device can be replaced by a guide wire<br>
and the assembly can be guided over the guide wire through the puncture. A person skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that various other techniques can be used to penetrate through the tissue.<br>
[0058] Once the distal end of the assembly 10 is inserted through the tissue, as shown in FIG.<br>
6A, the obturator 20 and endoscope 50 (or, for the embodiment of FIGS. 2A-2C, the end cap 40<br>
and endoscope 50) can be removed from the trocar sleeve 30. The trocar sleeve 30 will function<br>
as a placeholder for the puncture formed in the tissue, as the trocar sleeve 30 will remain<br>
extending through the puncture and into the body cavity, e.g., the abdominal cavity, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6B. The endoscope 50 can then be removed from the obturator 20 (or, for the embodiment<br>
of FIGS. 2A-2C, the end cap 40 can be removed from the endoscope 50), and the endoscope 50<br>
can be reinserted through the trocar sleeve 30. FIG. 6B illustrates the endoscope 50 about to be<br>
introduced into the trocar sleeve 30. Once the endoscope 50 is advanced through the trocar<br>
sleeve 30 to position the distal end of the endoscope 50 within the body cavity, e.g., the<br>
abdominal cavity 104, various medical procedures can be performed. The trocar sleeve 30 can<br>
remain in place or it can be removed leaving the endoscope 50 in place.<br>
[0059] While not shown, the assembly can also be used in conjunction with an expandable<br>
member used to expand the size of the puncture hole to facilitate insertion of the assembly<br>
therethrough. For example, a cutting device can be used to form a puncture in the tissue, and an<br>
expandable member, such as a balloon, disposed on the cutting device or on a separate device<br>
can be advanced and positioned within the puncture. The expandable member can then be<br>
expanded to increase the size of the puncture. The endoscope can then be advanced, pushing the<br>
-18-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
expanded expandable member and the endoscope through the puncture. Where this technique is<br>
used, it may not be necessary to use an obturator or end cap with the endoscope. Rather, the<br>
trocar sleeve can be positioned over the endoscope and passed through the puncture with the<br>
endoscope. The endoscope and expandable member can then be removed, leaving the trocar<br>
sleeve in place for receiving other devices therethrough.<br>
[0060] In another embodiment of the present invention, a protective barrier is provided to<br>
facilitate insertion of an endoscopic device, such as an endoscope, overtube, trocar assembly, or<br>
any other endoscopic device, through a tody lumen. FIGS. 7A-7B illustrate one exemplary<br>
embodiment of a protective barrier 200 and method for using the same. The particular<br>
configuration of the barrier 200 can vary, but in an exemplary embodiment the barrier 200 has a<br>
generally elongate hollow configuration with proximal and distal ends 200a, 200b. One of the<br>
ends, e.g., the distal end 200b, can be adapted to mate or attach to a distal end of an endoscopic<br>
device, such as endoscope 50, and the other end, e.g., the proximal end 200a, can be configured<br>
to remain external to the patient or to be disposed and retained within an opening to a body<br>
lumen, such as the patient's oral cavity. The particular configuration of each end can vary. For<br>
example, the distal end 200b can be formed from a resilient material to allow the distal end 200b<br>
to be disposed over and engage an endoscope 50 or other device. The proximal end 200a can be<br>
shaped to fit within an opening of a body :avity, such as an oral cavity, or it can merely be a<br>
terminal end of the tube. In an exemplary embodiment, the proximal end 200a is flared outward<br>
to facilitate introduction of the endoscope 50 or other device and distal end 200b of the barrier<br>
200 therethrough. In other embodiments, where the barrier 200 is formed from a resilient<br>
material, the ends 200a, 200b can merely be rolled over or folded onto themselves to form a soft<br>
terminal end surface.<br>
[0061] At least a portion of the barrier 20C can also be formed from a flexible or resilient<br>
material to facilitate insertion of at least the flexible or resilient portion through tissue. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 7A-7B, the entire barrier 200 is flexible to allow the mid-portion of<br>
the barrier 200 to be inserted translumenally, as will be discussed in more detail below. In other<br>
embodiments, the barrier can include a flexible or resilient portion and a portion that is more<br>
rigid. For example, the barrier can be formsd using a standard overtube and a flexible sheath<br>
that is coupled to the overtube. In use, as will be discussed below, the overtube can form an<br>
-19-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
inner sleeve of the device, and the flexible sheath can form an outer sleeve. The use of an<br>
overtube can provide support to the esophagus, which may be important in certain applications,<br>
such as an obese patient, prior conditions and operations, etc.<br>
[0062] In use, as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B, a mid-portion 200c of the barrier 200 is inserted<br>
translumenally preferably through the entire length of the body lumen, such as an esophagus,<br>
while the proximal and distal ends 200a, 200b remain outside of or just within the opening to the<br>
body cavity. Various inserter tools known in the art can be used to insert the mid-portion<br>
translumenally. For example, at least one support rod 300 can be positioned between the<br>
proximal end distal ends 200a, 200b of the barrier 200 and it can be advanced into the mid-<br>
portion 200c of the barrier 200 and through a body lumen to insert the mid-portion 200c through<br>
the body lumen. As a result, the barrier 200 will include an inner sheath and an outer sheath that<br>
extend through the lumen. Where the barrier includes an overtube or other more rigid portion,<br>
the flexible portion can form the outer sleeve, and the overtube can form the inner sleeve.<br>
Alternatively, the flexible portion can have a length that allows the flexible portion to form both<br>
the inner and outer sleeves, and the overtube can remain outside the body.<br>
[0063] The distal end 200b of the barrier 200 can be coupled to an endoscopic device, such as<br>
endoscope 50, and once the mid-portion 200c is inserted through the body lumen, the endoscope<br>
50, with the distal end 200b of the barrier 200 attached thereto, can be inserted into the proximal<br>
end 200a of the barrier 200 and through the body lumen. Again, where the barrier includes an<br>
overtube, the overtube can couple to the endoscope or other device and the overtube and<br>
endoscope can be inserted together through the flexible portion. As the endoscope 50 is being<br>
inserted through the barrier 200, the barrier 200 will prevent contact between the endoscope 50<br>
and the body lumen, thereby shielding the endoscope 50 and preventing any bacteria within the<br>
body lumen from being brought into a body cavity, such as the stomach. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the barrier 200 preferably has a length that allows the barrier 200 to extend through<br>
the entire body lumen, such as the esophagus, and into, for example, the stomach so there is no<br>
contact between the endoscope and the esophagus. Once the endoscope 50 is positioned in the<br>
stomach or other body lumen, various other procedures, such as those previously described, can<br>
be performed. For example, an endoscopic accessory can be inserted through the endoscopic<br>
device to facilitate insertion of the endoscopic device through tissue. A person skilled in the art<br>
-20-<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>
will appreciate that the barrier can be used in a variety of endoscopic and laparoscopic<br>
procedures, and it can have a variety of configurations to facilitate mating to and use with an<br>
endoscopic or laparoscopic device.<br>
[0064] In another exemplary embodiment, the various devices disclosed herein, or portions<br>
thereof, can be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used<br>
multiple times. For example, after at least one use, the device can be disassembled, followed by<br>
cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. By way of example,<br>
the end cap disclosed herein can be provided as a kit containing multiple end caps (the sizes can<br>
be the same or they can vary). After at least one use of the device, the end cap can be removed,<br>
the endoscope can be cleaned, and a new end cap can be placed on the endoscope to prepare for<br>
subsequent use. The various other devices disclosed herein can also be disassembled after at<br>
least one use, and any number of the particular pieces can be selectively replaced or removed in<br>
any combination. Replacement of pieces can also include replacement of portions of particular<br>
elements. Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular parts, the device can be reassembled<br>
for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility, or by a surgical team immediately prior to a<br>
surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning can utilize a<br>
variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such<br>
techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present<br>
application.<br>
[0065] One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention<br>
based on the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by<br>
what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims. All<br>
publications and references cited herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety.<br>
[0066] What is claimed is:<br>
-21 -<br>
 <br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-100 (END5844USNP)<br>

Methods and devices are provided for performing translumenal (e.g., transoral and<br>
transanal) procedures. In general, the methods and devices utilize a trocar assembly or trocar<br>
end cap that can facilitate insertion of an endoscope through tissue. In one embodiment, a<br>
flexible trocar assembly is provided and includes an obturator having an inner lumen formed<br>
therethrough for receiving an endoscope therein, and a distal end that is adapted to facilitate<br>
insertion of the endoscope through tissue and that is adapted to facilitate viewing therethrough.<br>
The trocar assembly can also include a trocar sleeve that is disposable over the obturator. In use,<br>
once the trocar assembly is inserted through tissue, the trocar sleeve can function as a<br>
placeholder, allowing the endoscope and obturator to be removed. The endoscope can then be<br>
removed from within the obturator and reinserted through the trocar sleeve for use in performing<br>
various other procedures. In other embodiments, rather than using a trocar that houses the<br>
endoscope, an end cap can be removably disposed over a distal end of the endoscope. The<br>
present invention also provides methods and devices for shielding an endoscope during insertion<br>
through a body lumen, and in particular for preventing contact between the endoscope (or trocar<br>
sleeve) and the body lumen, thus preventing bacteria from being carried into a body cavity.<br>
