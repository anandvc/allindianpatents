				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to bumpers and, more particularly, to energy<br>
absorbing vehicle bumper systems.<br>
Bumpers typically extend widthwise across the front and rear of a vehicle and<br>
are mounted to rails that extend in a lengthwise direction. Energy absorbing<br>
bumper systems attempt to reduce vehicle damage as a result of a collision by<br>
managing impact energy and intrusion while not exceeding a rail load limit of the<br>
vehicle. The efficiency of an energy absorber is defined as the amount of energy<br>
absorbed over distance. A high efficiency energy absorber absorbs more energy<br>
over a shorter distance than a low energy absorber. High efficiency is achieved<br>
by building load quickly to just under the rail load limit and maintaining that load<br>
constant until the impact energy has been dissipated.<br>
Increasing the stiffness of an energy absorber generally increases the efficiency<br>
of the absorber since a stiff energy absorber builds load more quickly than a less<br>
stiff absorber. In addition, there generally is less intrusion with a stiff energy<br>
absorber than with a less stiff energy absorber. Increasing the stiffness of the<br>
energy absorber, however, can result in an undesirable increase in the weight of<br>
the bumper system. Specifically, a more stiff energy absorber generally is heavier<br>
than a less stiff absorber.<br>
Some known energy absorbing bumper systems include a foam resin, such as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,352 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,941,701. Foam based<br>
systems typically have slow loading upon impact, which results in a high<br>
displacement. Further, foams are effective to a sixty or seventy percent<br>
compression, and beyond that point, foams become incompressible so that the<br>
impact energy is not fully absorbed. The remaining impact energy is absorbed<br>
through deformation of a backup beam and/or vehicle structure. Foams are also<br>
temperature sensitive so that displacement and impact absorption behavior can<br>
change substantially with temperature. Typically, as temperature is lowered,<br>
foam becomes more rigid, resulting in higher loads. Conversely, as temperature<br>
rises, foams become more compliant resulting in higher displacements and<br>
possible vehicle damage.<br>
Some known bumper systems include crash cans. The crash cans are separately<br>
fabricated and attached directly to the beam in alignment with the vehicle rails.<br>
The crash cans absorb energy during impact, e.g., an offset impact, and facilitate<br>
preventing damage to the beam. Separately fabricating and attaching the crash<br>
cans to the beam, however, increases bumper assembly costs and complexity.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, a bumper assembly for an automotive vehicle is provided. The<br>
bumper assembly comprises a beam and an injection molded energy absorber<br>
secured to the beam. The energy absorber comprises at least one crash can. The<br>
assembly further comprises a fascia for covering the beam and the energy<br>
absorber.<br>
In another aspect, an energy absorber for a bumper assembly is provided. The<br>
energy absorber comprises a frame and a body extending from the frame. The<br>
body comprises a first transverse wall, a second transverse wall spaced from the<br>
first wall, and at least one crash can between the first and second walls.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A bumper system that includes an energy absorber of the non-foam type with<br>
crash cans is described below in detail. The crash cans are sometimes described<br>
herein as being integral with the energy absorber. The term integral means that<br>
the crash cans are formed as a component of, and not separately from, the<br>
energy absorber, which results in a one-piece unitary structure for the energy<br>
absorber. While the crash can be separate from the energy absorber, as<br>
described below in more detail, a one piece, unitary energy absorber including<br>
the crash cans is believed to facilitate manufacturing as well as assembly of the<br>
energy absorber to a bumper rail.<br>
Combining a non foam type energy absorber with crash cans results in a bumper<br>
system that achieves fast loading and efficient energy absorption upon impact.<br>
Specifically, impact forces during low speed and high speed impacts are<br>
maintained just below a predetermined level by deforming the energy absorber<br>
and beam until the kinetic energy of the impact event has been absorbed. When<br>
the low speed impact is over, the energy absorber returns substantially to its<br>
original shape and retains sufficient integrity to withstand subsequent impacts.<br>
Further, combining the efficient energy absorbing properties of a thermoplastic<br>
energy absorber with the integrated crash cans is believed to provide improved<br>
impact absorbing performance over traditional metal beams with foam energy<br>
absorbers. In addition, the thermoplastic energy absorber with integrated crash<br>
cans is believed to provide more efficient impact absorption than steel beams<br>
with a thermoplastic energy absorbers that do not include crash cans.<br>
The energy absorber also achieves efficient energy absorption upon impact with<br>
a lower leg. Specifically, impact forces and impactor geometry during impacts<br>
(e.g., 40 Km/hr impacts) can be maintained within predetermined levels by<br>
deforming the energy absorber in a controller manner. Once the impact is over,<br>
the absorber returns substantially to its original shape and retains sufficient<br>
integrity to withstand subsequent impacts. Such an arrangement provides lower<br>
leg pedestrian impact protection.<br>
Further, the energy absorber can be packaged in a small space as compared to<br>
conventional foam systems. The automotive designers therefore have enhanced<br>
freedom to style bumpers while achieving pedestrian impact requirements. Also,<br>
since the energy absorbing system can be unitary and integrally molded<br>
thermoplastic engineering resin, the energy absorbing system can be easily<br>
recycled. Greater consistency also is achieved over varied temperatures, in<br>
comparison to foam systems. In addition, the energy absorber provides a<br>
smooth, predictable loading response regarding of the impact direction.<br>
Although the bumper system is described below with reference to specific<br>
materials (e.g., Xenoy.RTM. material (commercially available from General<br>
Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass.) for the energy absorber), the system is not<br>
limited to practice with such materials and other materials can be used. In<br>
addition, the beam need not necessarily be a steel beam, and other materials<br>
and fabrication techniques can be utilized. Generally, the energy absorber is<br>
selected from materials that result in efficient energy absorption, and the beam<br>
materials and fabrication technique are selected to result in a stiff beam.<br>
Referring now specifically to the drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 are cross-sectional<br>
views a known energy absorber 10 as used in association with a reinforcing<br>
beam 12. Energy absorber 10 includes upper and lower flanges 14 and 16,<br>
respectively, which upon installation overlap a portion of beam 12. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2, absorber 10 tends to buckle as opposed to absorbing and dissipating the<br>
impact energy resulting from a collision.<br>
FIG. 3 is an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of a bumper system<br>
20. System 20 includes an energy absorber 22 and a beam 24. Energy absorber<br>
22 is positioned between beam 24 and a fascia 26 which, when assembled, form<br>
a vehicle bumper. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, beam 24<br>
is attached to lengthwise extending frame rails (not shown).<br>
Fascia 26 is formed from a thermoplastic material which is amenable to finishing<br>
utilizing conventional vehicle painting and/or coating techniques. Fascia 26<br>
envelops both energy absorber 22 and beam 24 such that neither component is<br>
visible once attached to the vehicle.<br>
Beam 24, in the example embodiment, is steel and has a rectangular cross<br>
sectional shape. Beam 24 is hollow, i.e., a channel 28 extends through beam 24,<br>
and includes openings 30 for securing beam 24 to the frame rails of the vehicle,<br>
as described below in more detail. Rather than steel, beam 24 could, for<br>
example, be fabricated from a glass mat thermoplastic (GMT) or another plastic<br>
that provides a strength and stiffness required for a particular bumper<br>
application.<br>
Energy absorber 22 includes a frame 50 having first and second longitudinally<br>
extending flanges 52 and 54, respectively, which overlap beam 24. Absorber 22<br>
further includes a body 56 that extends outward from frame 50, and body 56<br>
includes a first transverse wall 58 and a second transverse wall 60 having a<br>
plurality of tunable crush boxes 62 extending therebetween. Transverse walls 58,<br>
60 are rippled including alternating raised areas 64 and depressed areas 66<br>
which provide transverse walls 58, 60 with added stiffness to resist deflection<br>
upon impact. The width and depth dimensions of the ripples can be modified to<br>
achieve different stiffness characteristics as desired. Crush boxes 62 include side<br>
walls 68, an outer wall 70, and open areas 72 that extend to inner frame 50.<br>
In addition to crush boxes 62, crash cans 74 are between walls 58 and 60 and<br>
are positioned to align (axially) with the vehicle rails. Crash cans 74 include, in<br>
the example embodiment, honeycomb shaped structures 76 and open areas 78<br>
that extend to frame 50.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, which is a perspective view of a portion of bumper assembly<br>
20, crash can 74 is aligned with rail 80 of a vehicle, and is positioned between<br>
crush boxes 62. Crush boxes 62 can have any one of a number of different<br>
geometries depending on the impact energy requirements for the vehicle.<br>
Example crush boxes 62 have an overall three-dimensional I-shape including a<br>
wing or top portion 82 adjacent first transverse wall 58 and a bottom wing<br>
portion 84 adjacent second transverse wall 60.<br>
Crash cans 74 also can have any one of a number of different geometries<br>
depending on the impact energy requirements for the vehicle. Example crash<br>
cans 74 have an overall square dimensional shape with honeycomb shaped<br>
structure 76 therein. Crash cans 74 facilitate absorbing energy during an offset<br>
impact, i.e., when the impact involves only a portion of bumper assembly 20.<br>
Crash cans 74 also provide a stiffness tunability in order to meet the desired<br>
impact load deflection criteria. That is, modifications can be made to crash cans<br>
74 for any given application in an effort to meet the targeted criteria. For<br>
example, the spacing between the walls and the size of honeycomb structure 76<br>
can be selected depending on the particular application.<br>
The tunability of crash cans 74 can also be tailored for specific applications by<br>
varying the wall thickness. For example, the nominal thickness of the walls may<br>
broadly range from about 1.75 mm to about 3.0 mm. More specifically, for<br>
certain low impact applications the nominal wall thickness may generally range<br>
from about 1.75 mm to about 2.0 mm and for other applications the walls would<br>
more likely be in the range of about 2.5 mm to 3.0 mm.<br>
Crush boxes 62 of energy absorber 22 stabilize energy absorber 22 during an<br>
impact event. In this regard, crush boxes 62 provide for an axial crush mode in<br>
both barrier and pendulum impacts according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety<br>
Standard (FMVSS) and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (CMVSS). Crush<br>
boxes 62 also provide a stiffness tunability in order to meet the desired impact<br>
load deflection criteria. That is, modifications can be made to crush boxes 62 for<br>
any given application in an effort to meet the targeted criteria. For example,<br>
crush boxes 62 include a plurality of windows 86. Windows 86 can be configured<br>
to have one of many different shapes depending on the particular application.<br>
The tunability of crush boxes 62 can also be tailored for specific applications by<br>
varying the side and rear wall thickness. For example, for the nominal wall<br>
thickness of the side and the outer wall may broadly range from about 1.75 mm<br>
to about 3.0 mm. More specifically, for certain low impact applications the<br>
nominal wall thickness may generally range from about 1.75 mm to about 2.0<br>
mm and for other applications, particularly those for a 5 mph FMVSS or CMVSS<br>
system, the nominal wall thickness for the side and rear walls would more likely<br>
be in the range of about 2.5 mm to 3.0 mm.<br>
Another aspect in appropriately tuning energy absorber 22 is the selection of the<br>
thermoplastic resin to be employed. The resin employed may be a low modulus,<br>
medium modulus or high modulus material as needed. By carefully considering<br>
each of these variables, energy absorbers meeting the desired energy impact<br>
objectives can be manufactured.<br>
More specifically, the characteristics of the material utilized to form energy<br>
absorber 22 include high toughness/ductility, thermally stable, high energy<br>
absorption capacity, a good modulus-to-elongation ratio and recyclability. While<br>
the energy absorber may be molded in segments, the absorber also can be of<br>
unitary construction made from a tough plastic material. An example material for<br>
the absorber is Xenoy, as referenced above. Of course, other engineered<br>
thermoplastic resins can be used. Typical engineering thermoplastic resins<br>
include, but are not limited to, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS),<br>
polycarbonate, polycarbonate/ABS blend, a copolycarbonate-polyester, acrylic-<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA), acrylonitrile(ethylene-polypropylene diamine<br>
modified)-styrene (ABS), phenylene ether resins, blends of polyphenylene<br>
ether/polyamide (NORYL GTXRTM. from General Electric Company), blends of<br>
polycarbonate/PET/PBT, polybutylene terephthalate and impact modifier<br>
(XENOY.RTM. resin from General Electric Company), polyamides, phenylene<br>
sulfide resins, polyvinyl chloride PVC, high impact polystyrene (HPS), low/high<br>
density polyethylene (l/hdpe), polypropylene (pp) and thermoplastic olefins<br>
(tpo).<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the bumper assembly 20 secured to rail 80. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5, bolts 100 extend through openings in a mounting plate 102<br>
welded to rail 80, as well as through openings 30 in beam 24 and openings in<br>
energy absorber 22. Bumper assembly 20, including integral crash cans 74,<br>
therefore is easily and readily secured to rails 80 without requiring separate<br>
alignment and attachment of crash cans 74.<br>
FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a portion of energy absorber 22 illustrating<br>
magnified partial perspective views of alternative window arrangements. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6, integrally molded connecting members 110 extend vertically<br>
between the first and second transverse walls 58 and 60, respectively.<br>
Connecting members 110 may be in the form of vertically extending posts or<br>
may have a cross shaped structure including both a vertically extended posts and<br>
horizontally extending posts. Regardless of the configuration of connecting<br>
members 110, connecting member 110 may have a minimum average width to<br>
height ratio of 1:5 along the inner wall of the vertically extending post, the<br>
height being measured as the distance between the first and second traverse<br>
walls 58 and 60, respectively. If connecting member 110 includes windows 86<br>
the width to height ratio is 1:3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6 and with respect to the tunability of crush boxes 62, windows<br>
86 can be, but are not limited to, squares and rectangles of different dimensions<br>
as shown at 120, 122, 124, 126 and tear drop shapes as shown at 128 in order<br>
to achieve the desired stiffness of the crush box. To form the windows, a typical<br>
mold will include approximately a 5.degree. open draft angle so as to obtain<br>
suitable manufacturing conditions.<br>
As explained above, integrating crash cans with an injection molded<br>
thermoplastic energy absorber coupled to a stiff beam is believed to provide<br>
enhanced energy absorption efficiency. Enhanced impact performance translates<br>
to reduced costs of repair for low speed "fender benders" and reduced vehicle<br>
damage during higher speed collisions. Further, since foam is not utilized, it is<br>
believed that greater consistency of impact performance may be achieved over<br>
varied temperatures.<br>
Rather than integrating the crash cans with the thermoplastic energy absorber, it<br>
is contemplated that the crash cans can be formed separate from the energy<br>
absorber and either attached to, e.g., press or snap fit, welded, to the energy<br>
absorber or with the bumper rail. Separate fabrication of the energy absorber<br>
and crash cans provides an advantage in that the crash cans can then more<br>
readily be fabricated using materials different from the material used to fabricate<br>
the energy absorber. Of course, various attachment techniques other than a<br>
press fit or snap fit (e.g., bolts) can be used to secure the crash cans to the<br>
energy absorber or rail.<br>
For example, and referring to FIGS. 7 and 8 which are a perspective view of a<br>
portion of a bumper assembly 150 including a snap fit crash can 152 and a<br>
cross-sectional view of bumper assembly 150, respectively, components in FIGS.<br>
7 and 8 identical to components in FIG. 4 are identified in_FIGS. 7 and 8 using<br>
the same reference numerals in FIG. 4. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a honeycomb<br>
structure 154 (i.e., crash can 154) includes a flange 156 and a snap 158 spaced<br>
from flange 156. Energy absorber 22 also includes a wall 160 having an opening<br>
162 therethrough, and opening 162 is sized so that structure 152 can be partially<br>
inserted therethrough. Crash can 152 is inserted through opening 162 until<br>
flange 156 abuts wall 160. Snap 158 snaps over wall 160 so that wall 160 is<br>
trapped between snap 158 and flange 156.<br>
Of course, other attachment techniques can be used to attach crash cans to an<br>
energy absorber. For example, the crash cans can be press fit or vibration<br>
welded to the energy absorber. FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate just one example of how<br>
separately fabricated crash cans can be secured to an energy absorber.<br>
The combination of the tunable crash cans and the tunable crush boxes with the<br>
energy absorber provides an efficient, fast loading and controlled impact event.<br>
This high efficiency is believed to result in facilitating reducing vehicle bumper<br>
offsets without increasing the loads transferred to the vehicle structure.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be<br>
practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
