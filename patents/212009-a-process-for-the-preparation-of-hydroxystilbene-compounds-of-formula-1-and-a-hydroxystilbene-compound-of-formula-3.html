The present invention relates to the use of hydroxystilbene compounds in the antimicrobial treatment of surfaces.<br><br>
C1-C16Alkyl are straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals, e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl, isoamyl ortert-amyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl or hexadecyl.<br>
C1-C16Alkoxy is e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, amyloxy, isoamyloxy or tert-amyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, isooctyloxy, nonyloxy, decyloxy, undecyloxy, dodecyloxy, tetradecyloxy, pentadecyloxy or hexadecyloxy.<br><br>
C6-C10Aryloxy is phenoxy or naphthyloxy.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The hydroxystilbenes used according to the invention can be in the form of E- or Z-isomers. They are preferably in the form of E-isomers.<br>
Interesting compounds that are used according to the invention are dihydroxystilbenes, that is to say compounds of formula (1) wherein R1 and R2 are hydroxy.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (3) are novel and the invention relates also thereto.<br><br>
The preparation of the compounds of formula (1) is carried out in accordance with processes known per se by reaction of an alkyl phosphite, e.g. triethyl phosphite, with a benzyl halide, preferably benzyl bromide. The phosphonate intermediate is obtained (1st step).<br>
The phosphonate intermediate is then reacted with an alkoxybenzaldehyde (2nd step). The subsequent dealkylation (3rd step) is carried out in accordance with customary methods.<br><br>
In a further variant, the hydroxystilbene compounds according to the invention can be prepared in a solid-phase synthesis using a trityl resin. The preparation is carried out in accordance with the following scheme:<br><br><br>

The hydroxystilbene compounds used according to the invention exhibit a pronounced antimicrobial action, especially against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against bacteria of skin flora, e.g. Corynebacterium xerosis (bacteria that cause body odor), and also against yeasts and moulds. They are therefore especially suitable in the disinfection of the skin and mucosa and also of integumentary appendages (hair), more especially in the disinfection of the hands and of wounds.<br><br>
They are therefore suitable as antimicrobial active ingredients and preservatives in personal care preparations, for example shampoos, bath additives, hair-care products, liquid and solid soaps (based on synthetic surfactants and salts of saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids), lotions and creams, deodorants, other aqueous or alcoholic solutions, e.g. cleansing solutions for the skin, moist cleansing cloths, oils or powders.<br>

16.5 g (0.3 mol) of sodium methanolate are added at O°C to a solution of 60 g (0.29 mol) of crude diethylbenzyl phosphonate in 415 ml of anhydrous DMF.   Then, at 0**C, a total of 50.0 g (0.3 mol) of 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde is added in portions.

are prepared and diluted in serial dilutions to final concentrations of from 1000 ppm to 10 ppm.<br>
Test principle:	0.3 ml of the dilution stage in question is mixed with 15 ml of still-<br>
liquid nutrient medium. When the nutrient substrate has solidified, 10 µl portions of the following organism dilution of the test strains in 0.85 % NaCI solution are spotted onto the agar medium:<br>

* Aspergillus niger ATCC 6275	1:10 dilution<br>
The plates are incubated at 37°C for 24 hours (A.niger 3 days at 28°C) and then the highest dilution of the test substance at which<br><br>
growth is just no longer discernible (corresponds to MIC) is determined.<br>
The results show that the test substances exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against gram-postive and gram-negative bacteria and also fungi.<br>
The test results for the compounds listed below are given in Table 1:<br><br><br><br>
Examples 4 to 87: Solid-phase synthesis method<br>
The following hydroxystilbenes are synthesised in accordance with known procedures<br>
(R. Willard etal., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 2,1995, 45-51).<br>
The reaction is carried out in accordance with the following scheme:<br><br><br>
Using this method a matrix of 12 x 7 = 84 hydroxystilbenes having the following structural scope is synthesised:<br>
General formula:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
— = not determined<br>
*) The MIC values were obtained by measuring the optical density at substance concentrations between 100; 10 and 1 ppm. In that respect some of the data are indicative values for the activity. The MIC values of the compounds having good activity were obtained by measuring the optical density at concentrations between 120; 60; 30; 15; 7.5; 3.75 ppm.<br><br>
Determination of the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC value) in microtitre plates:<br>
Nutrient medium:<br>

dilution of 1:2.<br>
Bacteria and yeast are cultured overnight in CASO bouillon, the mould on mycological slant agar and rinsed off with 10 ml of 0.85 % sodium chloride solution (+ 0.1 % TritonX-100). All test organisms are adjusted to an organism count of 1.5x106 CFU/ml with 0.85 % sodium chloride solution.<br>
The test substances are prepipetted into microtitre plates in an amount of 8 ^1 per well.<br>
Previously diluted organism substances are diluted 1:100 in CASO bouillon (bacteria and yeast) and Sabouraud 2 % glucose bouillon (mould) and added to the test substances in an amount of 192 µl per well.<br>
The test batches are incubated for 48 hours at 37°C (bacteria and yeast) or for 5 days at 28°C (mould).<br>
After incubation, the growth is determined by reference to the turbidity of the test batches (optical density) at 620 nm in a microplate reader.<br><br>
