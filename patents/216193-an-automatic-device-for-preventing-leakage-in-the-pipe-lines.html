Fig. 1 shows the sectional plan view of the device.<br>
Fiq. 2 shows the sectional plan view of spring  operated mechanism.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the top view of the platform.<br><br>
Referr inq to the drawings particularly fig.1, the device of this invention has an upper vertical cylinder A having the top end as a closed end. Holes Di and D2 of the equal dimensions are provided towards the top end of the upper cylinder. Holes Al and A2 of the same dimensions are provided towards the bottom end of the upper verticle cy1inder A and at the opposite sides thereof. A slot arrangement, (not shown) is provided at the ht3ttom end of the cylinder A for fixing the cylinder A. ThÂ»- eads are provided at the outer surface of the cylinder A, Valves EI and E2 are disposed within the cylinder A towards the top end thereof. Similarly, valves Fl and F2 are provided within the cylinder A towards the bottom end thereof. Connecting rods XI and X2 are provided to connect the valves El and E2 and Fl and F2 with each other. A horizontal connecting rod R is provided at the top ends of the valves El and E2 and is coupled thereto fay means of threads. A spring operated mechanism M having a vertical light shaft P secured at the top end thereof is mounted on the horizontal connecting rod R. A lower hollow vertical cylinder  B is provided below the vertical  cylinder  A.<br><br>
The upper end of the lower vertical cylinder B is secured with the lower end of the upper vertical cylinder A by means of screwed fastener F. holes Bl and B2 are provided near the top end of the lower vertical cylinder B. similarly, the holes CI and C2 are provided towards the bottom end of the cylinder B. valves Gl and G2 are connected with the valves HI and H2 by means of a connecting rods Yl and Y2 and are disposed in the vertical cylinder B. A horizontal connecting rod R1 is secured to the bottom ends of the valves H1 and H2. A vertical light shaft Q is secured with the horizontal connecting rod Rl at the bottom surface thereof. A platform P (see fig.3) is mounted on the valves Fl and F2 having air pressure chamber AC connected therewith by means of connecting rods CR respectively. An alternative pipe line N2 is provided towards the top end of the upper cylinder A and towards the bottom end of the lower cylinder B to accommodate the respective ends therein. This whole assembly is adapted to be disposed within the main pipe line M1. The compression spring operated mechanism M as shown in fig.2 has a helical spring 1 disposed within a casing 2 having top end as the closed end. The closed end of the casing has a central opening through which a thread 3<br><br>
extends  outwardly beinq connected to the upper plate  4<br>
of the helical spring 1, The lower plate 5 of the he!ical  spring  1  is mounted on the  top  end  of  the<br>
slidinq part 6 being connected to another slidinq part 7 by means of a Blot arranqement S.  A projection  stopper<br>
8 is provided towards the bottom end of the slidinq par t 2.   A thread 9 is secured at the bottom surface of  the<br>
projection stopper 8.<br>
The vertical cylinder (B) is connected to the main pump. The pipes f Ml and N2) are connected to the pi pes (M.1 and N21 subsequently. Vertical light shaft/connecting r od (P) is connected to the connecting rod/vertical light shaft Q by vertical 1ight shafting containing threads provided at the both sides. The flow starts from the main pipe through vertical cy1inder (B) through hoies <bl and b2 entering into main pipeline in certain speed velocity due to the liquid force is acting on platform so element starts compress. compression valves f2 uncover holes a2 as we i1 cover thf="wh.nl" e aitri d2> by valves <e1 and e2>  of  the<br><br>
vertical cylinder (A) Himultaneousjy. So the liquid enters  into  main chamber MC, the 1iquid  again  enters<br>
into main pipeline through the holes (Bl and B2) of the vertical   cylinder   (B).    Above   process    repeats<br>
automatically again and again in main pipeline.<br>
If any leakage in main pipe line, the liquid flow is decreases, so the piston starts to release from the compression state and covers the hole (Al and A2) by valve (Fi and F2), Simultaneously at the top of the cylinder valves (El and E2) uncovers the whole (01 and D2) of the vertical cylinder (A). Spring operated mecnanism (as exp1ained above) to push the vertica1 shaft in horizontal position. Immediately valves (HI and H2) from the first compartment uncovers the hole (CI and C2&gt; and valve (Gl and G2&gt; covers the whole (Bl and B2) simultaneously to block the main canal junction.<br>
So  the liquid directly enters from main  pipeline  into<br>
the alternative pipe (N), through the holes (Cl and C2J,<br>
of  the  vertical  cylinder (B),  and  enters  into  the<br>
vertical cylinder      (A) through the holes (J&gt;1      and     D2&gt;.<br>
Finally  the 1iquid enters into the main  canal  through<br>
the  holes (Bi and B2) of the vertical cylinder  (B)  of<br>
the  second compartment.  So the above  process  repeats<br>
automatically when there is any leakage in main pipeline.<br><br><br>
