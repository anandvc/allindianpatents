This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Fluconazole. Fluconazole which is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l,3-bis(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-propan-2-ol and is an antifungal agent developed by Pfizer Inc. Fluconazole is therefore useful for treating various fungal infections such as mycohemis , mycosis ( both in the respiratory system and digestive system), and fungal meningitis, which are caused by, among others, various species of Candida coccidodes and trichophyton. Fluconazole inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol an important component of fungal cell membrane. The inhibition is highly specific to ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi. There are quite a number of processes known for the preparation of Fluconazole. For example process for the preparation of Fluconazole and its intermediates can be found in the following patents.<br>
CN1353108 (2002) discloses a process for the preparation of Fluconazole which involves the reaction of 2"Chloro-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone with 1,2,4-triazole produced insitu by thermal reaction of formamide , formic acid and hydrazine hydrate. The yields are lower because of the formation of an isomer due to the attack of 4-position of 1,2,4-triazole produced insitu with 2-chlorO"2',4'-difluoroacetophenone to give 2-(4H-.l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone. WO02076955 (2002) The patent deals in the reaction of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2,3-epoxypropyl-lH-l,2,4-triazole with l-(trimethylsilyl)-l,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole-l-yl sodium to give 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l,3-bis( 1,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2-(trimethylsilyl-oxy)propane.Hydrolysing the silyl ether with aqueous methanol ,isopropylalcohol etc.) to give Fluconazole. This process mainly focuses on the modification of crystal structure of Fluconazole. The process is expensive because of the use of the expensive (l-trimethylsilyl)-l,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole-l-yl sodium.<br>
TW457239 (2001) discloses a process which involves the reaction of 2-chloro-2\4'-difluoroacetophenone with hydrazinehydrate to give hydrazone derivative. The hydrazone derivative is then cyclised with S-triazine to give 2 -(1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -yl)-2' ,4' -difluoroacetophenone. This process is also expensive because of the use of the expensive S-triazine to cyclise the hydrazone derivative to 1,2,4-triazole derivative. In addition, the process is also hazardous because of the requirement of handling of the toxic hydrazinehydrate.<br>
US PATENT NO, 6063933(2000) deals with the preparation of 2-(2,4-difluoropheny)-l,3.bis-(lH-triazole-l-yl)-2,3-epoxypropane by the oxidation of the E-isomer of 1,3-bis-(lH-1,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l-propene in methylene chloride, water and potassium carbonate   with   m-chloroperbenzoic   acid.   The   epoxy   derivative   is   further   reacted   in<br><br>
terahydrofurane with lithium aluminium hydride to give Fluconazole. m-Chlororperbenzoic acid, tetrahydrofurane, lithium aluminium hydride are expensive and hazardous chemicals . The process is therefore not commercially economical.<br>
US PATENT NO 5872258(1999) describes the formation of Fluconazole via the use of 3-(lH-1,2,4-triazole-1 -yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1 -propene. The preparation of starting material involves four steps from 1,3-difluorobenzene. The first step is the reaction of 1,3-difluorobenzene with isopropylalcohol and cone. Sulphuric acid to give 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-propane. The second step is bromination with N-bromosuccinamide to give l,2-dibromo-2-(difluorophenyl)-propane. The third step is reaction of second step product with 1,2,4-triazole to give the mixture of E and Z isomer of the starting material . The mixture of isomers are separated in the fourth step. The propene derivative is oxidized with potassium permangnate to give 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole in only 27% yield. This dihdroxy derivative is further reacted with sulphuryl chloride. Lot of effluents are generated in the oxidation step with potassium permangnate due to the formation of manganese dioxide .Sulfuryl chloride is expensive and hazardous. Therefore the process is not economical and not environment friendly.<br>
EP0967210(1999) deals with the manufacture of Fluconazole by the reaction of 2-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone with dihalomethane in the presence of samarium-(ll) iodide at -25 degree centigrade. The availability of samarium iodide commercially is difficult and quite expensive and also the reaction is carried out at very low temperature i.e. -25 degree centigrade, which makes the process expensive at commercial scale.<br>
CNl 126722(1996) discloses a process for the preparation of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2,3-epoxypropyl-lH-l,2,4-triazole and its purification as methanesulphonate salt. The process involves the conversion of 1,3 -difluorobenzene to 2-( 1H-1,2,4-difluorophenyl)-2' -4' -difluoroacetophenone in three steps using standard procedure.<br>
This product is reacted with trimethyl sulfoxonium iodide in aqueous base to give crude 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2,3-epoxypropyl-lH-l,2,4-triazole. This is then purified by reacting with methanesulphonyl chloride in organic solvent. The epoxy derivative is converted to Fluconazole by standard procedure. The process is lengthy due to the isolation and purification of epoxy derivative and hence not economical.<br>
JP PATENT NO. 8217761(1996) deals with the preparation of 2-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2\4'-difluoroacetophenone by the reaction of 2-chloro-2\4'-difluorophenyl acetophenone with 4-amino-l,2,4-triazole in solvent of straight or branched chain alcohol of 4 or more carbon atoms<br><br>
such as n-butanol. The product is extracted with water in combination with n-hexane. The aqueous phase is directly subjected to deamination treatment with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid. The solvent n-butanol is expensive and is lost at deamination step. The process is therefore expensive. Further the patent only deals in the preparation of 2-(lH-l,2,4-triazole4-yl) 2',4'-difluoroacetophenone which is an intermediate and also is not economical. 1112492211(1995) describes the reaction of 2"(2,4-difluorophenyl&gt;l-bromo-3-(lH-l,2,4-l-yl)-2-propanol with 4-amino-l,2,4-triazole to give 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-3-(4H-4-amino-l,2,4-triazonium-l-yl)-2-propanol bromide. This salt is then deaminated using standard process to give crude Fluconazole, which is purified by recrystallising from isopropyl alcohol. The preparation of starting material is as per<br>
(i) the reported in literature (Synthesis 647,1983). The process involves the use of Grignard reaction of difluorobenzene magnesium bromide with 1,3-dichloroacetone or (ii)  reaction of (lH-l,2,4-triazole-l) methyl magnesium chloride with 2-chloro-2',4'-difluoro-acetophenone. Both the processes are not safe because of handling of sensitive Grignard reactions. The product obtained by these processes are highly expensive due to use of expensive solvents such as tetrahydrofurane and also the alkyl halide used for making grignard reagents are either not available commercially or expensive . Hence the process is not economical. US PATENT NO 5710280(1998) describes a five step process starting from 1,3-difluorobenzene, The first step is formation of 2-chloro-2,4-difluoroacetophenone from 1,3-difluorobenzene ,chloroacetyl chloride via Friedel craft acylation in presence of methylene chloride as solvent. The second step is reaction of 2-chloro-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone with 4-aminO"l,2,4-triazole in acetonitrile ,and the product is filtered and dried . The third step is the deamination by standard procedure where the product is filtered and dried. Fourth step is the reaction of third step product with trimethyl sulphoxonium iodide, 1,2,4-triazole in aqueous base to give crude Fluconazole. The   crude   Fluconazole   is   recrystallised   from   ethylacetate/n-haxane.   There   is   use   of methylenechloride at first step and acetonitrile at second step. Methylenechloride is chlorinated solvent which is not preferred solvent, acetonitrile on decomposition emits highly toxic fumes of cyanide and nitriles. Therefore methylene chloride and acetonitrile<br>
are not most preferred solvents for handling and environmental safety. Moreover both these solvents are expensive and methylene chloride is low boiling solvent hence huge amount of losses at commercid level.<br><br>
The above process has the following drawbacks:<br>
(a) The use of methylene chloride at the acylation step of 1,3-difluorobenzene with chloroacetyl chloride in the presence of aluminium trichloride as the catalyst makes the process uneconomical .This is because methylene chloride is not only an expensive solvent but also has low boiling point, which results in huge amount of losses during work up.<br>
(b) Conversion of 2-chloro-2\4'-difluoroacetophenone(CAP) to 2-(4-amino-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)- 2\4'-difluoroacetophenone salt (TAAP) by reaction of CAP with 4-amino-4H-1,2,4- triazole (4AT) using acetonitrile as the solvent. Acetonitrile is also expensive and there are heavy losses during filtration and drying. Moreover acetonitrile is not very good solvent handling wise. Therefore it would be advisable to avoid the use acetonitrile in the commercially applicable process Therefore the process is not only economical for commercial application but also not environmentally safe. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Consideringtheimportanceof the drug Fluconazole commercially it is felt that if an improved process which is not only economical but also enviroimientally friendly is developed it would be useful and beneficial to the society.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Fluconazole which is economical by providing one pot reaction using only two steps including purification.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Fluconazole which is environmentally safe by avoiding use of solvents such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile etc.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Fluconazole which is environmentally safe by the use of methanol as the solvent for condensation with 4H-amino-l,2,4-triazole instead of earlier reported solvents like acetonitrile, n-butanol &amp; isopropanol.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Fluconazole in which the acylation of 1,3-difluorobenzene with chloro acetyl chloride is carried out without using any solvent thereby making the process economical, simple and safe<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding after a sustained research &amp; development work that (i) by avoiding the use of methylenechloride in the step of preparing 2-chloro-2,4-difluoroacetophenone in step(i), and in step(ii) using methanol as the solvent in the<br><br>
reaction of 2-chloro-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone with 4-amino-l,2,4-triazole to give 2-(4-amino-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl)-2\4'-difluoroacetophenone. The separated salt is extracted in ethylacetate, or toluene or their mixture. The solvent is recovered under vacuum and the residue is reacted with trimethyl sulfoxonium iodide, l(H)-l,2,4-tria2ole in presence of base to give technical Fluconazole. The technical Fluconazole is purified by dissolving in dil. hydrochloric acid, treating with activated carbon. To the filtered solution, adding mixture of solvent, ethylacetate, acetone, and methanol and then adjusting pH to neutral with aqueous base. Pure Fluconazole separates which is filtered and dried,<br>

This reaction is carried out without using any solvent . The completion of the reaction completion is monitored on Gas chromatograph and the absence of l,3-difluoroben2ene in the reaction mixture is checked. The reaction mixture is then quenched in toluene or ethylacetate or mixture. The recovery of solvent gives 2-chloro-2',4'-difluoroacetophenone ( CAP) in nearly quantitative yield<br>
The CAP so prepared is reacted with 4H-amino-l,2,4-triazole in methanol as the solvent. The quantity of methanol to be used may be preferably two to six times of the quantity of 1,3-difluorobenzene or more preferably two to four times or still more preferably about two times . The reaction may be conducted at a temperature in the range of 60-70 degree centigrade for about 3-24 hours, preferably 10-18 hours or ore preferably for about 12hours. The completion of the reaction is checked by thin layer chromatography. The unused methanol is recovered and the residue is dissolved in dilute . hydrochloric acid . The solution is subjected to deamination by conventional methods . The 2-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-yl )-2\4'-difluoroacetophenone formed is extracted in toluene or ethylacetate or their mixture . The organig layer is separated and the residue after the solvent recovery so obtained is reacted with trimethylsulfoxoniumiodide(TMSI), l,2,4-triazole(AT) and aqueous base as reported in US Pat.NO. 5710280 or mixture of solvent such methanol, isopropyl alcohoI,t-butanol,acetonitrile,dimethylformamide,dimethylsulphoxide as reported in W098/32744. The reaction is worked up by recovering the organic solvent, addition of water and adjusting pH to neutral with aqueous base. The separated technical Fluconazole is filtered and dried( purity more than 95% by HPLC).<br>
The technical Fluconazole so prepared  is purified by dissolving in dil hydrochloric acid and mixed with solvents like ethylacetate , acetone ,and methanol or  their mixtures in then ratio ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 : 0.5 to 0.75 : 0.05 to 0.2 based on the input of technical Fluconazole .

The impurities as determined on HPLC can be (a) the impurities after main peak of Fluconazole (b) the impurities before the main peak of Fluconazole. The impurities falling within the category (a) are removed / reduced by employing a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetone in the above said proportions   and the impurities falling within the category (b) are removed / reduced by employing methanol in the above mentioned proportions . Accordingly the combination of the above said solvents in the above said proportions removes / reduces the impurities resulting in a product (Fluconazole) having purity in the range of 99 to 99.8%<br><br>
The pH of the clear solution is adjusted  to neutral to give   pure Fluconazole (purity more than<br>
99to99.8%byHPLC<br>
