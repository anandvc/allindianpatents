ENDOSCOPIC STITCHING MACHINE<br>
	The invention relates to an endoscopic stitching machine<br>
	according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
	DE 101 16 171 Al discloses a surgical suturing machine<br>
	which is used in particular for making sutures inside the<br>
	body of humans or animals. Since suturing machines of this<br>
	type must be inserted at least partly into the human or<br>
	animal body, it is desirable for the components to be<br>
	inserted into the body to have the smallest possible<br>
	volume. For this reason, not only the actual control<br>
	elements but if possible also the drives for the stitch-<br>
	forming tools such as needles, grippers and pressure pads,<br>
	are located in a housing which remains outside the body.<br>
	The movements produced by the various drives are therefore<br>
	transmitted to the stitch-forming tools arranged at the end<br>
	of the housing shaft by means of suitable transmission<br>
	means accommodated by a housing shaft.<br>
	The resulting large overall length of the housing shaft and<br>
	also the housing accommodating the various drives therefore<br>
	make it very difficult to sterilise the parts of the<br>
	surgical suturing machine coming in contact with the body,<br>
	which is necessary after every intervention.<br>
	It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a<br>
	solution which facilitates sterilisation for a generic<br>
	stitching machine whilst retaining the functional distance<br>
	between the housing and the stitch-forming tools.<br>
	This object is achieved starting from a generic stitching<br>
	machine whereby the housing shaft and the transmission<br>
	means are divided within planes each running transversely<br>
	to their longitudinal direction and the respective (lower<br>
	and upper) sections of the transmission means are<br>
	detachably connected to each other by means of respectively<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
	one coupling piece, whereby the coupling pieces can be<br>
	introduced into and positively housed within corresponding<br>
	recesses of the transmission means parallel to the plane of<br>
	intersection and running in the longitudinal direction of<br>
	the transmission means.<br>
	The term "transmission means" in this case is to be<br>
	understood as those parts of the surgical suturing machine<br>
	which transmit movements generated indirectly or directly<br>
	by the respective drive for the stitch-forming tools (such<br>
	as, for example, needles, grippers, pressure pads) to said<br>
	tools. If the functional distance between the stitch-<br>
	forming tools and the housing is relatively short, these<br>
	can be the needle rod, gripper shaft and the pressure rod<br>
	for the pressure pad itself or additional transmission<br>
	means which are provided between the needle rod, the<br>
	gripper shaft and the pressure rod for the pressure pad on<br>
	the one hand and the corresponding exits of the individual<br>
	drives on the other hand.<br>
	In this way, a type of plug connection is provided between<br>
	the respective lower and upper sections of the transmission<br>
	means or the needle rods, gripper shaft and the push rod<br>
	for the pressure pad which allows the connection between<br>
	the two parts of the respective transmission means or the<br>
	needle rod, the gripper shaft or the push rod for the<br>
	pressure pad to be broken and remade without tools whilst<br>
	ensuring that the overall length of the transmission means<br>
	of the coupling pieces is always the same.<br>
	If the releasing and joining of the transmission means<br>
	which transmits the working movement for the needle to said<br>
	needle takes place in the upper dead point area of its<br>
	movement path, this position of the transmission means can<br>
	serve as a reference position for the releasing and joining<br>
	of the other transmission means whereby, in particular when<br>
	joining the transmission means, the relative position<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	between the sections of the transmission means connected to<br>
	the respective drive and the sections of the transmission<br>
	means carrying the stitch-forming tools is predefined and<br>
	ensures that the respective sections of the transmission<br>
	means are joined in the correct position without the<br>
	assistance of auxiliary means.<br>
	A constructively favourable design of the coupling pieces<br>
	suitable for the transmission of longitudinal and rotary<br>
	movements of the transmission means is achieved if these<br>
	have a central section at the front ends whereof, there is<br>
	provided respectively one shaped part directed transversely<br>
	to the longitudinal direction of the transmission means,<br>
	which can be inserted into a recess of the transmission<br>
	means corresponding to its cross-sectional shape.<br>
	In order to eliminate a centre offset when joining the<br>
	transmission means and/or to be able to compensate for a<br>
	centre offset caused by manufacturing inaccuracies, the<br>
	longitudinal axes of the two shaped parts of each coupling<br>
	piece enclose an angle of 90 degrees.<br>
	In this case, it is furthermore advantageous if the shaped<br>
	parts each have a prismatic and an adjoining substantially<br>
	cylindrical region and the recesses of the transmission<br>
	means are configured as complementary hereto.<br>
	In order to secure the two halves of the housing shaft<br>
	longitudinally and transversely, its separation to form<br>
	mutual bearing surfaces is step-shaped and in the<br>
	separating region of one shaft part positioning means are<br>
	provided for the other shaft part, which project into<br>
	openings provided on the separating region of the other<br>
	shaft part. In this case, the positioning means can be<br>
	formed by dowel pins which engage in corresponding holes of<br>
	the other shaft part. This facilitates the joining of the<br>
	two shaft parts on the one hand and on the other hand, the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	positioning means together with the holes at the same time<br>
	form a longitudinal securing of the two shaft parts.<br>
	In order to secure the position of the two shaft parts and<br>
	also the relative position of the coupling pieces to the<br>
	sections of the transmission means in the radial direction,<br>
	the housing shaft is enclosed by a centring tube which is<br>
	arranged concentrically to said shaft, which can be<br>
	detachably connected to the upper shaft part by means of a<br>
	locking device in the area of its end on the housing side.<br>
	In this case, it is advantageous if the locking device has<br>
	a spring-loaded locking bolt which can be moved radially in<br>
	the housing shaft which engages in a recess formed at the<br>
	end of the centring tube on the housing side.<br>
	In order to facilitate the location of the correct relative<br>
	position of the same when joining the sections of the<br>
	transmission means and also to secure said position, in the<br>
	circumferential area of the lower shaft part, two holes<br>
	directed transversely to said part and parallel to one<br>
	another are provided to receive a positioning aid, which<br>
	holes simultaneously engage in cut-outs of the transmission<br>
	means.<br>
	Further advantages and details of the invention are<br>
	obtained with reference to the following description of an<br>
	exemplary embodiment of the same which is shown in the<br>
	appended drawing.<br>
	In the figures:<br>

	coupling piece;<br>
	Fig. 4a:	is an enlarged view of the detail "A" in Fig. 4;<br>
	The endoscopic stitching machine shown schematically in<br>
	Fig. 1 has the same basic structure as the suturing machine<br>
	described in DE 101 16 171 Al. Accordingly, the stitching<br>
	machine according to the invention has a substantially L-<br>
	shaped housing 1 which is formed by a gripping portion 2<br>
	embodied as a hollow body, a housing shaft 3 directed<br>
	substantially perpendicular thereto and central housing<br>
	portion 4 which joins said shaft to the gripping portion 2.<br>
	Located inside the gripping portion 2 is an electric motor<br>
	which is not shown, which is preferably embodied as a DC<br>
	motor. The drive shaft, not shown, of the DC motor drives a<br>
	main shaft via a clutch and a reducing gear, from which the<br>
	movements for a needle 5 and a gripper 6 as well as for a<br>
	pressure pad 8 are derived. The formation of the gearing<br>
	used for this purpose is described in detail in the<br>
	aforesaid DE 101 16 171 Al so that its description is to be<br>
	regarded as a component of the description of the present<br>
	invention insofar as this is of interest for the<br>
	understanding of the present invention.<br>
	Accordingly, the gearing has a needle drive which is<br>
	drivingly connected via a transmission means 9 to the<br>
	needle rod 11 carrying the needle 5 and imparts an upward<br>
	and downward movement to the needle 5.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
	The gearing further has a swinging drive for the gripper 8<br>
	which executes a lifting movement and a swinging movement.<br>
	The swinging drive is kinematically connected to the<br>
	gripper shaft 10 via a transmission means 12 and imparts to<br>
	said shaft both a lifting movement and a swinging movement.<br>
	This transmission means 12 thus executes a lifting/swinging<br>
	movement composed of a lifting and a swinging component and<br>
	thus transmits both an alternating torque and also tensile<br>
	and compressive forces.<br>
	Finally, a lifting movement of the pressure pad 8 is<br>
	derived from the needle drive during the pushed-out phase<br>
	of the needle 5 so that at least during a part of the<br>
	pushed-out phase of the needle 5 the pressure pad 8 can<br>
	hereby be periodically lifted by a certain amount to<br>
	facilitate the advancing movement of the stitching<br>
	material. For this purpose, a transmission means 13 is<br>
	drivingly connected to the corresponding (not shown) driven<br>
	member of the needle drive, whose movements are transmitted<br>
	to a push rod 7 which is rigidly connected to the pressure<br>
	pad 8.<br>
	As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3, the tubular housing<br>
	shaft 3 is divided into an upper shaft part 14 and a lower<br>
	shaft part 15 by a dividing plane running substantially<br>
	transversely to its longitudinal direction. The dividing<br>
	plane which is advantageously provided as close as possible<br>
	to the end of the housing shaft on the housing side, runs<br>
	in a step shape in this case so that bearing surfaces 16,<br>
	17 are formed on both shaft parts 14, 15. Both a radial and<br>
	an axial alignment are hereby predefined when joining the<br>
	two shaft parts 14, 15. In the area of the bearing surfaces<br>
	16 of the upper shaft part 14, positioning means formed by<br>
	dowel pins 18 are fixed thereon, said means projecting into<br>
	holes 19 formed in the area of the bearing surfaces 17 in<br>
	the lower shaft part 15 when the housing shaft 3 is joined.<br>
	The two shaft parts 14, 15 are thus secured in position in<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	their longitudinal and transverse direction. When joined,<br>
	the two shaft parts 14, 15 are surrounded by a centring<br>
	tube 21 whose upper end can be detachably connected to the<br>
	upper shaft portion 14 of the housing shaft 3 by means of a<br>
	locking device 22. The locking device 22 has a locking bolt<br>
	23 which is arranged so that it can be displaced radially<br>
	in the upper shaft part 14 and is pressed outwards under<br>
	the action of a spring (not shown) , said bolt engaging,<br>
	when the centring tube 21 is pushed onto the housing shaft<br>
	3, in a recess provided thereon. This recess is formed by a<br>
	transverse hole 25 substantially corresponding to the<br>
	diameter of the locking bolt 23, which is slitted towards<br>
	the end of the centring tube 21.<br>
	The transmission means 9, 12, 13 connected to their<br>
	relevant drive and guided in the housing shaft 3 are<br>
	divided in their region corresponding to the separating<br>
	position of the housing shaft within a plane running<br>
	transversely to their longitudinal direction, into<br>
	respectively two sections, namely into the respectively<br>
	upper sections 9a, 12a and 13a and the respectively lower<br>
	sections 9b, 12b and 13b and are detachably connected to<br>
	one another by means of respectively one coupling piece 26<br>
	(Fig. 4, 4a). All the coupling pieces 26 have a standard<br>
	design and are therefore provided with the reference<br>
	numeral 26. Each of the coupling pieces 26 has a central<br>
	portion 27 whose cross-sectional shape corresponds to the<br>
	cross-section of the respective transmission means 9, 12<br>
	and 13. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention shown<br>
	in the drawing, all the transmission means 9, 12, 13<br>
	uniformly have a circular cross-section so that all the<br>
	central portions 27 of the coupling pieces 26 are embodied<br>
	as cylindrical, their diameter being somewhat smaller than<br>
	that of the transmission means. In the area of its two<br>
	front ends, each coupling piece 28 is provided with a total<br>
	of two shaped parts 28, 29 which are configured as<br>
	substantially cylindrical in the exemplary embodiment shown<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	and which are connected to the central portion 27 by means<br>
	of respectively one web 31. As can be seen in particular<br>
	from Fig. 4a of the drawing, the two shaped parts 28, 29 of<br>
	each coupling piece 26 enclose an angle of preferably 90<br>
	degrees so that any centre offset of the two sections of<br>
	the transmission means can thus be compensated.<br>
	The sections of the transmission means to be joined<br>
	together using the coupling pieces 26 have recesses 32, 33<br>
	at their ends to be joined to one another, the shape of<br>
	these recesses corresponding to the shape of the shaped<br>
	parts 28, 29 and the webs 31. Accordingly, in the<br>
	respectively lower regions of the respectively upper<br>
	sections 9a, 12a and 13a of the transmission means 9, 12<br>
	and 13, there is provided respectively one transverse hole<br>
	34 which opens into a slot 35 which is open towards the<br>
	front of the respective transmission means, its width being<br>
	adapted to the width of the web 31. The shape of the<br>
	recesses 32 is therefore determined by the transverse hole<br>
	34 and the slit 35.<br>
	Similarly, in the respectively upper regions of the<br>
	respectively lower sections 9b, 12b and 13b of the<br>
	transmission means 9, 12 and 13, there is provided<br>
	respectively one transverse hole 36 running at an angle of<br>
	90 degrees to the transverse hole 34 which opens into a<br>
	slot 37 which is open towards the front of the respective<br>
	transmission means, its width being adapted to the width of<br>
	the web 31. The shape of the recesses 33 is therefore<br>
	determined by the corresponding transverse hole 36 and the<br>
	slit 37.<br>
	Thus, the coupling pieces 26 can be displaced radially in<br>
	the recesses 32, 33 to compensate for production<br>
	inaccuracies or a centre offset but are held positively in<br>
	the axial direction as a result of the shaping of the<br>
	recesses 32, 33 and the shaped parts 28, 29. Since the<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	centring tube 21 is guided over the housing shaft at the<br>
	upper and lower sections of the transmission means which<br>
	are interconnected by the coupling pieces 26 and the joined<br>
	lower and upper shaft part, and is connected to said shaft<br>
	by means of the locking device 22, the coupling pieces 26<br>
	are also positively secured in the radial direction. This<br>
	means that the housing shaft 3 and the parts located in its<br>
	interior form a structural unit which is held together<br>
	without screw connections and can be dismantled for<br>
	sterilisation purposes into its components and joined<br>
	together again without the assistance of tools.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the two shaped<br>
	parts 28, 29 can be moved within the respective recess 32,<br>
	33 with a slight sliding fit. This is particularly<br>
	important for compensating for centre offset and/or<br>
	unavoidable production tolerances.<br>
	Since after their first joining, the shaped parts 28 of the<br>
	coupling pieces 26 pertaining to the respectively upper<br>
	sections 9a, 12a and 13a of the transmission means always<br>
	adopt this angular position even in the case of subsequent<br>
	multiple separation and respective re-joining of the<br>
	transmission means, the position of the shaped parts 29 of<br>
	the coupling pieces 26 assigned to the respectively lower<br>
	sections 9b, 12b and 13b of the transmission means is thus<br>
	predefined.<br>
	This means that when joining the respectively lower<br>
	sections 9b, 12b and 13b of the transmission means, their<br>
	relative position to the upper sections 9a, 12a and 13a is<br>
	predetermined, i.e. the lower sections 9b, 12b and 13b are<br>
	to be brought into a position in which they can be slid<br>
	over the shaped parts 29 whereby their cylindrical region<br>
	dips into the respective transverse hole 36 and the webs 31<br>
	slide into the respective slot 37.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	In order to facilitate the location and securing of the<br>
	joining position of the lower transmission means 9b, 12b<br>
	and 13b, two holes 38, 39 directed transversely to its<br>
	longitudinal axis and parallel to one another are provided<br>
	in the circumferential region of the lower shaft part 15,<br>
	forming recesses which are open on one side and preferably<br>
	have a semicircular cross-section in the lower shaft part<br>
	15. Corresponding cut-outs 42 are provided on the lower<br>
	transmission means 9b, 12b and 13b, forming cylindrical<br>
	openings with the recesses formed by the holes 38, 39 in<br>
	the lower shaft part 15 in the joining position of the<br>
	lower transmission means 9b, 12b and 13b. The position of<br>
	the cut-outs 42 on the lower transmission means 9b, 12b and<br>
	13b on the one hand and the position of the holes 38, 39 in<br>
	the lower shaft part 15 on the other hand is selected so<br>
	that when the cut-outs 42 are aligned with the holes 38,<br>
	39, the respective lower shaped parts 29 and the webs 31 of<br>
	the coupling pieces 26 are directed parallel to the<br>
	relevant hole 36 or to the corresponding slot 37 and can be<br>
	inserted therein.<br>
	The respective cut-outs 42 and the holes 38, 39 are used to<br>
	receive two legs 43, 44 of a positioning aid 41 which are<br>
	located parallel to one another at a distance, whereby the<br>
	joining position of the lower transmission means 9b, 12b<br>
	and 13b is guided until the centring tube 21 slides over<br>
	the area of the separating position of the shaft.<br><br>
