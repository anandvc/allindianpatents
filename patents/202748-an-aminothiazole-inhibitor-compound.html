independent basis.<br>
The term "halogen" or "halo" refers to, chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine.<br>
When a functional group is termed "protected", this means that the ISr    group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site. Suitable protecting groups for the compounds of the present invention will be recognized from the present application taking into account the level of skill in the art, and with reference to standard textbooks, such as Greene, T. W. et al., Protective Groups in Organic iyf Synthesis, Wiley, N.Y. (1991).<br>
Suitable examples of salts of the compounds according to the invention with inorganic or organic acids are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses but which can be employed, for example, for the Iff   isolation or purification of free compounds I or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, are also included.<br><br>
All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The definition of the compounds according to the invention embraces all possible stereoisomers and their mixtures. It very particularly embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers having the specified<br><br><br><br>
activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the S-   racemates by conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.<br>
It should be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the compounds of formula I are also within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art. Accordingly, the Ijy    compounds of the instant invention may be in the free or hydrate form, and may be obtained by methods exemplified by the following schemes.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br><br><br>
(V)<br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme 1, compounds of formula I where X is S are prepared by reacting 2-aminothiazole (II) with bromine in the presence of .sodium or potassium thiocyanate to obtain a thiocyanated aminothiazole, ^20     specifically 5-thiocyanatoaminothiazole (III). Compound III is then<br>
reacted with R4-L, where L is a leaving group such as a halogen, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine to provide a 5-fchiocyanatDthiazole intermediate (IV), where R4 is as defined in the specification. The intermediate (IV) is then reduced to a thiol (V) using<br><br><br>
reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), sodium borohydride, zinc or other known reducing agents. Compound (V) is then reacted with alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl halides, such as R3 (CRiR2)n-L, where L is a leaving group such as a halogen, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate to obtain compounds of formula I. The steps of reducing the thiocyanothiazole intermediate (IV) to the thiol (V), and the reaction of the reduced thiol (V) to provide compounds of formula I where X is S, may be carried out sequentially without purification.<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
In Scheme 2, 5-thioacetyl-2-acetylaminothiazole of structure VI is reacted with an alkoxide such as potassium t-butoxide in alcohol or THF solvent and the resulting thiol is reacted in situ with a group of formula R3(CRiR2)n-L (where L is a leaving group, such as a halogen) such as 2-halomethyloxazole (VII) to provide a compound such as formula VIII, wherein Ri and Rz are hydrogen, and Re is acetyl. The 2-halomethyloxazole compounds of formula VII may be prepared using<br><br><br>
several synthetic routes known in the art. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 30, 1865 (1982); Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan (52, 3597 (1979); JCS Chem. Comm. 322 (1981); Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 6, 177, edited by A. Katritzky and C.W. Rees, Pergamon Press (1984).<br>
Compounds of formula VIII (a compound of formula I where R4 is acetyl and X is sulfur) can be hydrolyzed in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide to provide a compound of formula IX. A compound of formula IX may then be reacted with R4-L, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, where L is a leaving group such as a halogen, to give compounds of formula I where X is sulfur. In this manner, compounds of formula IX, which is a compound of formula I where R4 is hydrogen, can be treated with agents such as isothiocyanates, halides, acyl halides, chloroformates, isocyanates or sulfonyl chlorides to provide thioureas, amines, amides, carbamates, ureas or sulfonamides.   The procedures in 15/- Scheme 2 specifically illustrate a methyloxazole group, but are general for all R3(CRiR2)n- groups specified by formula I.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula VII, where L is bromine, may be prepared by halogenation of 2-methyloxazole using N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of dibenzoylperoxide.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme 3 illustrates an alternative method of preparing compound VII, which is a compound of formula R3(CRiR2)n-L where L is chlorine and n is the integer 1. In this scheme, compound VII is prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula X and formula XI in the presence of a<br>
jiT   base such as triethylamine to provide compounds of formula XII. Compound XII may be oxidized by an oxidant such as oxalylchloride/DMSO in the presence of a base such as triethylamine to provide a compound of formula XIII which may be cyclized by an agent such as phosphorous oxychloride to provide compounds of formula VII,<br>

In Scheme 5, starting compound XVI denotes a resin-bound benzyl alcohol support used for solid phase synthesis which is prepared from a<br>
Merrifield resin denoted as **, and 2-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, followed by reduction with reducing agents such as NaBHU.   In step 1, starting compound XVI is treated with triphosgene and triphenylphosphine (PPI13) in dichloromethane to give the chlorobenzyl resin of formula XVII. In step 2, a thiocyanato trifluoroacetamide (XVIII) is alkylated with the resin-bound benzyl chloride (XVII) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) to form a resin-bound thiocyanate (XIX). \0T   The thiocyanato trifluoroacetamide compound of formula XVII is prepared by reacting 5-thiocyanatoaminothiazole of formula III (Scheme I) with trifluoroacetic anhydride using a base such as 2,6-lutidine.<br>
f<br>
The resin-bound thiocyanate (XIX) is then reduced to a resin-bound thiol (XX) in step 3 with reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and methanol. The resulting resin-bound thiol (XX) is reacted with R3(CRiR2)n-L, where L is a leaving group, in the presence of a base such as l,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) at 80 °C in dimethylformamide (DMF) to form compounds of formula XXI (step 4). Deprotection of the trifluoroacetyl group of compound XXI is<br>
Z0     performed in step 5 using sodium borohydride to provide a compound of formula XXII. In step 6, the deprotected compound XXII is reacted with ReX, where X is a leaving group, in the presence of a base such as . diisopropylethylamine to provide compounds of formula XXIII. The product is then cleaved from the solid phase resin in step 7 with<br>
23     trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to give compounds of formula I where X is<br>
sulfur. Compounds of formula I where X is S(0)m and m is 1 or 2 may be prepared from compounds of formula I where m is 0 by oxidation with an oxidant such as sodium periodate, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, or oxone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
. Scheme 6 illustrates the preparation of compounds of formula I from a 2 bromo thiazole XXIV. A compound of formula IX is reacted with a diazotizing agent such as tBuONO in the presence of copper bromide to provide the exemplary 2-bromo thiazole of formula XXTV. Compound XXIV may then be reacted with a compound of formula RtNH2, with or without an added base, to provide compounds of formula I.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I may also be prepared starting from 2-bromothiazole XXV by reaction with a compound of formula R4NH2, with or without an added base, to provide a compound of formula XXVI. The compound of formula XXVI may be reacted with a thiocyanating agent such as sodium thiocyanate in the presence of bromine to provide a compound of formula IV, that may then be converted to a compound of formula I as described in Scheme 1. Alternatively, the compound of formula XXVI may be treated with a brominating agent such as bromine in acetic acid to generate a compound XXVII. Compounds of formula XXVII may be reacted with either XXVIII or XXIX (themselves available from a compound of formula VII) in the presence of base to provide compounds of formula I.<br>
The starting compounds of Schemes 1-7 are commercially available or may be prepared by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
