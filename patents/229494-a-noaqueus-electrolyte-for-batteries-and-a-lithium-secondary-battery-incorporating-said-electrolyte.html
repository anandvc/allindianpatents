				<td>A NONAQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE FOR BATTERIES AND A LITHIUM<br>
SECONDARY BATTERY INCORPORATING SAID ELECTROLYTE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary<br>
battery with improvements in charge/discharge and cycle life<br>
characteristics at ambient and high temperatures, and/or<br>
storage characteristics and safety at high temperature, as<br>
well as a nonaqueous electrolyte for use therein.<br>
Background Art<br>
With the recent advancement of electronic technology,<br>
portable information devices, such as mobile phones, PDA and<br>
laptop computers, are widely used. In such portable<br>
information devices, there are strong demands for smaller<br>
size, lighter weight, and continuous long-term driving. As a<br>
driving power source for such portable information devices,<br>
batteries are used. Thus, studies to develop batteries,<br>
particularly lithium secondary batteries using nonaqueous<br>
electrolytes, which have light weight while showing high<br>
voltage, high capacity, high power, high energy density and<br>
long cycle life, are being actively conducted.<br>
Generally, lithium secondary batteries utilize lithium-<br>
containing transition metal oxide as a positive active<br>
material. Examples of the positive active material include<br>
LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4, LiMnC2, LiNi1-xCoxMYO2 (M = Al, Ti, Mg<br>
or Zr; 0 

Furthermore, the lithium secondary batteries utilize carbon,<br>
lithium metal or alloy as a negative active material. Also,<br><br>
metal oxides, such as TiO2 and SnO2, which can store and<br>
release lithium ions and have a potential of less than 2V for<br>
lithium, may be used as the negative active material.<br>
When such lithium secondary batteries are stored at<br>
high temperature or exposed to high temperature, gas will be<br>
generated within the batteries by the side reaction of<br>
electrodes with the electrolyte oxides, resulting in<br>
deterioration in storage life characteristics and safety at<br>
high temperature, as well as deterioration in battery<br>
performance.<br>
Meanwhile, regarding an improvement in the cycle life<br>
of the lithium secondary batteries, Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Publication No. 1996-138735 describes that if LiPF6 was used<br>
as an electrolyte, ar effect on the improvement of cycle life<br>
by the addition of metal halides would not be obtained.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object: of the present invention to provide a<br>
lithium secondary oattery which has improvements in<br>
charge/discharge efficiencies and cycle life characteristics<br>
even when it operates at ambient or high temperature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
lithium secondary battery with high-temperature safety, in<br>
which the generation of gas by the side reaction of<br>
electrolyte oxides with electrodes is inhibited even when the<br>
battery is stored at high temperature or exposed to high<br>
temperature.<br>
The present inventors have found that the use of metal<br>
halide in a non-aqueous electrolyte has little or no effect<br>
on the improvement of battery cycle life and shows a<br><br>
reduction in battery cycle life, whereas the use of halogen,<br>
such as iodine, chlorine or bromine, in the nonaqueous<br>
electrolyte, has an effect on the improvement of battery<br>
cycle life and shows improvements in. storage characteristics<br>
and safety at high temperature, unlike the case of the metal<br>
halide.<br>
Moreover, the present inventors have found that the<br>
addition of both a pyrrole or its derivative and halogen to<br>
the nonaqueous electrolyte has a synergistic effect on the<br>
improvement of battery cycle; life.<br>
The present invention has been made based on these<br>
findings.<br>
The present invention provides:<br>
(i) a nonaqueous electrolyte for batteries, which is<br>
characterized by containing halogen; .<br>
(ii) a nonaqueous electrolyte for batteries, which is<br>
characterized by containing pyrrol or its derivative and<br>
halogen; and<br>
(iii) a lithium secondary battery which is<br>
characterized by including the nonaqueous electrolyte (i) or<br>
(ii).<br>
The addition of halogen, such as iodine, chlorine or<br>
bromine, into the nonaqueous electrolyte, results in an<br>
improvement in the cycle life of the lithium secondary<br>
battery.<br>
Meanwhile, although an SEI insulator film having no<br>
electron conductivity is formed on the negative electrode<br>
surface of the lith.um secondary battery, the addition of<br>
pyrrole or its derivative to the nonaqueous electrolyte leads<br>
. to the formation cf polypyrrole, an electron-conducting<br><br>
polymer, thus lowering resistance.<br>
Furthermore, by a synergistic effect with halogen, the<br>
pyrrole or its derivative in the nonaqueous electrolyte<br>
provides an improvement in charge/discharge cycle<br>
characteristics and an outstanding improvement in battery<br>
cycle life.<br>
Moreover, if halogen is used as an electrolyte additive<br>
as described above, the high-temperature safety of the<br>
battery will be secured. The reason thereof is as follows.<br>
If the battery is stored at high temperature or exposed<br>
to high temperature, the solvent in the nonaqueous<br>
electrolyte will be partially oxidized to cause a side<br>
reaction with the positive and negative electrodes of the<br>
battery, thus generating gas. This will cause not only<br>
deterioration in the battery performance but also<br>
deterioration in the battery swelling leading to<br>
deterioration in the battery safety.<br>
Halogen, such as iodine, chlorine or bromine, which is<br>
used as the electrolyte additive, is a material having strong<br>
adsorption property. Thus, the halogen is adsorbed on the<br>
electrodes upon initial charge, so that when the battery is<br>
stored at high temperature or exposed to high temperature,<br>
the halogen inhibits "he side reaction between the oxide of<br>
the electrolyte and :he positive and negative electrodes,<br>
thus inhibiting the generation of gas. For this reason, a<br>
swelling phenomenon at high temperature occurs less<br>
seriously. Thus, the use of the halogen can provide a battery<br>
having excellent storage characteristics and safety at high<br>
temperature.<br>
Particularly, the use of iodine as the electrolyte<br><br>
additive has the greatest effect on the inhibition of gas<br>
generation.<br>
The halogen is added to the nonaqueous electrolyte at<br>
an amount ranging from 0.005% by weight to 1% by weight. If<br>
the halogen is used at amounts out of this content range, it<br>
will have a reduced effect on the improvement of battery<br>
cycle life. The content of the halogen in the nonagueous<br>
electrolyte is preferably in a range of 0.01-0.5% by weight.<br>
At a content of less than 0.01% by weight, the halogen will<br>
have an insignificant effect on the inhibition of gas<br>
generation, and at a content of more than 0.5% by weight, it<br>
will cause deterioration in the battery performance.<br>
The pyrrole or its derivative is preferably added to<br>
the nonaqueous electrolyte at the amount of 0.01-0.5% by<br>
weight. At less than 0.01% by weight, the thickness of a film<br>
formed from the pyrrole or its derivative will be<br>
insufficient, and at more than 0.5% by weight, the charge<br>
characteristic of the battery will be poor.<br>
Examples of the halogen include, but are not limited<br>
to, iodine, chlorine and bromine.<br>
Examples of. the pyrrole derivative include, but are not<br>
limited to, 2,5-dimethylpyrrole, 2,4-dimethylpyrrole, 2-<br>
acetyl N-methylpyrrole, 2-acetylpyrrole, and N-methylpyrrole.<br>
The inventive lithium secondary battery includes the<br>
inventive nonaqueous electrolyte. Examples of the lithium<br>
secondary batteries include lithium-metal secondary<br>
batteries, lithium-ion secondary batteries, lithium polymer<br>
secondary batteries, and lithium-ion polymer secondary<br>
batteries.<br>
The inventive lithium secondary battery includes:<br><br>
a)	a positive electrode capable of storing and<br>
releasing lithium ions;<br>
b)	a negative electrode capable of storing and<br>
releasing lithium ions;<br><br>
c)	a porous separator; and<br>
d)	a nonaqueous electrolyte containing:<br>
i) a lithium salt; and<br>
ii) a liquid electrolyte compound.<br>
The inventive nonaqueous electrolyte preferably<br>
contains cyclic carbonate and/or linear carbonate. Examples<br>
of the cyclic carbonate include, are not limited to/ ethylene<br>
carbonate (EC) , propylene carbonate (PC) and gamma-<br>
butyrolactone (GBL) Examples of the linear carbonate<br>
include, but are not limited to, diethyl carbonate (DEC),<br>
dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), and<br>
methylpropyl carbonate (MPC).<br>
The inventive nonaqueous electrolyte contains lithium<br>
salts which are preferably selected from the group consisting<br>
of LiClO4, LiCF3SO3, LLPF6, LiBF4, LiAsF6, and LiN(CF3SO2)2.<br>
In the present invention, lithium-containing transition<br>
metal oxide is used as a positive active material. Examples<br>
of the positive active material include, but are not limited<br>
to, LiCoO2, LiNiO2, L.LMn2O4, LiMnO2, LiNi1-xCOxMyO2 (M = Al,. Ti,<br>
Mg or Zr; 0 
0.5; 0<y and a mixture of two or more thereof. also></y>
metal oxides, such as MnO2., or a mixture of two or more<br>
thereof may be used as the positive active material.<br>
As a negative active material, carbon, lithium metal or<br>
alloy may be used.<br>
Also, in the inventive lithium secondary battery,<br><br>
separator may be a porous separator, such as a porous<br>
polyolefin separator.<br>
According to a conventional method, the inventive<br>
lithium secondary battery can be fabricated by placing the<br>
porous separator between the positive electrode and the<br>
negative electrode and introducing a nonaqueous electrolyte<br>
containing the lithium salt, such as LiPF6, and additives.<br>
The inventive lithium secondary battery may be used in<br>
a pouch, cylindrical or angular shape.<br>
Advantageous Effect<br>
According to the present invention, the cycle life of<br>
the lithium secondary battery can be improved by adding the<br>
halogen to the nonaqueous electrolyte of the lithium<br>
secondary battery, and a synergistic effect on the<br>
improvement of the battery cycle life can be expected by<br>
adding pyrrole or its derivative together with the halogen to<br>
the nonaqueous electrolyte. This effect on the improvement of<br>
the battery cycle life suggests an improvement in the<br>
charge/discharge cycle characteristics of the battery.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the<br>
halogen, such as iodine, chlorine or bromine, is added to the<br>
nonaqueous electrolyte of the lithium secondary battery. When<br>
the lithium secondary battery is stored at high temperature<br>
or exposed to. high tenperature, the added halogen is adhered<br>
to the electrode surface so as to inhibit the side reaction<br>
between the oxides formed by the oxidation of the electrolyte<br>
at high temperature and the positive and negative electrodes,<br>
thus inhibiting the generation of gas. Thus, the present<br>
invention can provide the battery having excellent storage<br><br>
characteristics and safety at high temperature.<br>

Best: Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail by examples. It is to be understood, however, that<br>
these examples are given for illustrative purpose only and<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
LiCoO2 as a positive active material, a carbon material<br>
as a negative active material, and 1M LiPF6 solution with a<br>
composition of EC: DEC =1 : 1, as an electrolyte, were used.<br>
To the electrolyte, O.1% by weight of aluminum iodide was<br>
added, and the resulting electrolyte was introduced into a<br>
7OO-mAh lithium-ion polymer battery, thus fabricating a<br>
battery. The fabricated lithium-ion polymer battery was<br>
subjected to a cycle life test in which the battery was<br><br>
charged to 4.2 V at a current of 7OO mA in a constant<br>
current/constant vcltage mode, cut-off upon the reduction of<br>
current to 5O mA, discharged at a current of 7OO mA in a<br>
constant current mode, and cut-off at 3 V.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>

same manner as in Comparative Example 1 except that the<br>
aluminum iodide was added to the electrolyte at the amount of<br>
O.5% by weight. A cycle life test on the fabricated battery<br>
was performed in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>

same manner as in Comparative Example 1 except that tin<br>
iodide in place of the aluminum iodide was added to the<br>
electrolyte at the amount of O.1% by weight. A cycle life<br>
test on the fabricated battery was performed in the same<br>
manner as in Comparative Example 1.<br>
Example 1<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative: Example 1 except that iodine in<br>
place of the aluminum iodide was added to the electrolyte at<br>
the amount of O.O5% by weight. A cycle life test on the<br>
fabricated battery was performed in the same manner as in<br>
Comparative Example 1.<br>
Test result 1<br>
FIG. 1 is a graphic diagram showing the comparison of<br>
discharge capacity ratio at a range of initial cycle to 4OO<br>
cycles between batteries fabricated according to Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 3 and Example 1. As shown in FIG. 1, it could<br>
be found that an increase in the amount of addition of the<br><br>
aluminum iodide resulted in a reduction in the battery cycle<br>
life (Comparative Examples 1 and 2), and also the addition of<br>
the tin iodide resulted in a reduction in the battery cycle<br>
life (Comparative Example 3) . However, it could be confirmed<br>
that the battery of Example 1 where the iodine had been used<br>
at an amount determined in view of the weight ratio of iodine<br>
to metal iodide in Comparative Example 1, 3 showed an<br>
improvement in the battery cycle life over the case of use of<br>
the metal halides<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
LiCoO2 as a positive active material, a carbon material<br>
as a negative active material, and 1M LiPF6 solution with a<br>
composition of EC: DEC = 1 : 1, as an electrolyte, were used.<br>
The electrolyte was introduced into an 800-mAh lithium-ion<br>
polymer battery, thus fabricating a battery. The fabricated<br>
lithium-ion polymer battery was. subjected to a cycle life<br>
test in which the battery was charged to 4.2 V at a current<br>
of 800 mA in a constant current/constant voltage mode, cut-<br>
off upon the reduction of current to 50 mA, discharged at a<br>
current of 8OO mA in a constant current mode, and cut-off at<br>
3 V.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative Example 4 except that 2,5-<br>
dimethylpyrrole was added to the electrolyte at the amount of<br>
0.2% by weight. A cycle life test on the fabricated battery<br>
was performed in the same manner as in Comparative Example 4.<br>
Example 2<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative .Example 4 except that iodine<br><br>
was added to the electrolyte at the amount of 0.05% by<br>
weight. A cycle Life test on the fabricated battery was<br>
performed in the saute manner as in Comparative Example 4.<br>
Example 3<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Comparative Example 4 except that 2,5-<br>
dimethylpyrrole and iodine were added to the electrolyte at<br>
the amounts of 0.2% by weight and 0.05% by weight,<br>
respectively. A cycla life test on the fabricated battery was<br>
performed in the same manner as in Comparative Example 4.<br>
Test result 2<br>
FIG. 2 is a graphic diagram showing the comparison of<br>
discharge capacity ratio at a range of initial cycle to 400<br>
cycles between batteries fabricated according to Comparative<br>
Examples 4 and 5 and Examples 2 and 3. As shown in FIG. 2, it<br>
could be found that, although the single addition of 2,5-<br>
dimethylpyrrole or iodine could have an effect on the<br>
improvement of discharge capacity ratio (Comparative Example<br>
4 and Example 2), the addition of iodine in combination with<br>
2,5-dimethylpyrrole provided a further improvement in<br>
discharge capacity ratio (Example 3) .<br>
Example 4<br>
LiCoO2 as a positive active material, a carbon material<br>
as a negative active material, and 1M LiPF6 solution with a<br>
composition of EC: DEC =1 : 1, as an electrolyte, were used.<br>
Iodine was added to the electrolyte at the amount of 0.05<br>
wt%, and the resulting electrolyte was introduced into an<br>
800-mAh 383562-size lithium-ion polymer battery, thus<br>
fabricating a battery.<br>
Example 5<br><br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Example 4 except that the iodine as the<br>
electrolyte additive was added at the amount of 0.2 wt%.<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Example 4 except that the iodine as the<br>
electrolyte additive was not added.<br>
Comparative Example 7<br>
A lithium-ion polymer battery was fabricated in the<br>
same manner as in Example 4 except that aluminum iodide in<br>
place of the iodine was. added at the amount of 0.5 wt%.<br>
High-temperature storage test<br>
The 800-mAh 383562-size lithium ion polymer batteries<br>
fabricated in Examples 4 and 5 and Comparative Examples 6 and<br>
7 were fully charged to 4.2 V at a current of 500 mA in a<br>
constant current/constant voltage mode, and cut-off when the<br>
current was reduced :0 50mA.<br>
The resulting lithium ion polymer batteries were placed<br>
in an oven and subjected to a high-temperature storage test<br>
which comprises the following three steps: elevating the oven<br>
temperature from ambient temperature to 90 °C for 1 hour,<br>
storing the batteries at 90 °C for 4 hours, and lowering the<br>
oven temperature to ambient temperature for 1 hour. During<br>
the high-temperature storage test, a change in the thickness<br>
of the batteries was observed. The results are shown in Table<br>
1 below and FIG. 3.<br><br><br><br>
Table 1 shows the battery capacities at 0.2C rate<br>
before and after the high-temperature storage test. As<br>
evident from Table 1, the capacity recovery rates before and<br>
after the high-temperature storage test were higher in<br>
Examples 4 and 5 and Comparative Example 7 than those in<br>
Comparative Example 6.<br>
Furthermore, FIG. 3 shows a change in the thickness of<br>
the lithium-ion polymer batteries during the high-temperature<br>
storage test. As shown in FIG. 3, an increase in the<br>
thickness of the batteries fabricated in Examples 4 and 5 and<br>
Comparative Example 7 was lower than that of Comparative<br>
Example 6, and the increase in the battery thickness was<br>
lower in Example 5 and Comparative Example 7 than that in<br>
Example 4. As described above, this is because the iodine was<br>
 adsorbed on the positive or negative electrode so as to<br>
inhibit the side reaction between an electrolyte oxide formed<br>
at high temperature and the positive or negative electrode,<br>
thus inhibiting the generation of gas. Also, an increase in<br>
the amount of addition of the iodine showed an increase in<br>
 the effect of the iodine. It is thought that the case of the<br>
aluminum iodide showed an improvement by an increase in the<br>
addition amount thereof.<br><br>
the negative active material b) is carbon, lithium metal or<br>
alloy.<br><br>
