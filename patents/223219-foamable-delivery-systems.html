FOAMABLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS<br>
STIEFEL LABORATORIES, INC; A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS    255    ALHAMBRA    CIRCLE,    CORAL<br>
GABLES, FL 33134, U.S.A<br><br>
THE   FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present inventive subject matter relates to novel foamable delivery systems. The present inventive subject matter further relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating a disease, disorder, or condition using the inventive delivery systems. The present inventive subject matter further relates to methods for making and methods for delivering a foamable pharmaceutical composition. While these foamable drug delivery systems may be utilized for administration of a wide variety of drugs to epithelial tissues to treat a wide variety of diseases, disorders, or conditions, the inventive foamable drug delivery systems are particularly useful for treating diseases affecting mammalian skin and mucous membranes by application or instillation of a pharmaceutically active agent that can modify the appearance, metabolic or functional state, permeability, and/or health of a living organism.<br>
Background<br>
Foamable dosage forms are known in the art generally as suitable for topical application to mammals. However, foams are further known as a volatile dosage form that do not exhibit a great deal of stability.<br>
Foam stability<br>
Foams are thermodynamically unstable systems. Since the total surface area in a foam is large, there is a considerable amount of surface energy present. Accordingly, a surface active agent is necessary to achieve any reasonable degree of stability so the foam can last for a reasonable amount of time.<br>
Good emulsifying agents are, in general, also good foaming<br><br><br>
agents,since the factors influencing emulsion stability against droplet coalescence and foam stability against bubble collapse are similar. The stability of a foam depends upon three principal factors: (1) the tendency for liquid films to drain and become thinner; (2) the tendency of foam bubbles to rupture as a result of random disturbances; and (3) change in bubble size. Other factors which may significantly influence foam stability include evaporation and gas diffusion through the liquid films.<br>
Foam drainage<br>
Initially, foam drainage takes place mainly by gravitational flow, allowing the spheres of gas in the foam to become closer together. Foaming agents play an important role at this stage in restricting gravitational flow to a level where local disturbances and consequent film rupture is minimized.<br>
When the films between the gas spheres have attained a thickness on the order of micrometers, gravitational flow becomes extremely slow. When the bubble wall becomes sufficiently thin to be permeable, the gas in the smaller bubbles diffuses into adjacent bubbles to equalize the pressure and produce larger bubbles. This spontaneous process increases the average bubble size without film rupture. The predominant drainage mechanism then involves liquid being discharged locally via capillary action at positions of interfilm contact known as Plateau borders, where the liquid capacity is relatively high, existing throughout the foam. The final, stable equilibrium product is a fragile, honeycomb structure, in which the separating films have plane surfaces.<br>
Foam drainage causes the liquid films separating the gas bubbles to become thinner.  This usually leads to film rupture.<br>
Film rupture<br>
In addition to film drainage, the stability of a film depends on the ability of the liquid film to resist excessive local thinning and rupture occurring as a result of random disturbances.  A number of factors may be involved with varying<br><br>
degrees of importance, depending on the nature of the particular foam in question.<br>
For example,when a film is subjected to local stretching as a result of some external disturbance, the consequent increase in surface area will be accompanied by a decrease in the surface excess concentration of foaming agent and a resulting local increase in surface tension. A certain time is required for surfactant molecules to diffuse to this surface region and restore the original surface tension. This increased surface tension may persist for long enough to cause the disturbed film region to recover its original thickness, stabilizing the foam.<br>
The stress that creates regions of higher surface tension is always present in a foam film. The liquid film is flat at one place and curved convexly at another, where the liquid accumulates in the interstices between the bubbles. The convex curvature creates a capillary force, called the Laplace effect, that sucks liquid out of connected foam films so that internal liquid flows constantly from the flatter to the more curved parts of the films. As the liquid flows, the films are stretched, new surfaces of higher tension are created, and a counter-flow across the surfaces is generated to restore the thinned-out parts of the films, a process called the Marangoni effect. In this way, the foam films are in a constant state of flow and counterflow, one effect creating the conditions for its reversal by the other.<br>
Rupture of the liquid films separating the bubbles leads to coalescence of the bubbles and complete collapse of the foam structure.<br>
Changes in bubble size<br>
Change in bubble size can lead to thinning of the lamellae and may cause mechanical shocks that result in film rupture. As a foam ages, the small bubbles become smaller and the large bubbles grow larger. This occurs because the pressure in a small bubble is higher than that in large bubbles. The difference in pressure between the two bubbles increases until the smaller<br><br>
bubble disappears completely. The resulting rearrangement of the bubbles in the foam could lead to an increased possibility of mechanical shock followed by film rupture and coalescence.<br>
Surface rheology<br>
Rheology is the science of deformation and flow of matter. The mechanical properties of the surface films of a foam have a considerable influence on foam stability. First, high bulk liquid viscosity retards the rate of foam collapse. However, high surface viscosity also produces strong retardation of bulk liquid flow close to the surfaces and, consequently, the drainage of thick films is considerably more rapid than that of thin films, which facilitates the attainment of a uniform film thickness. Second, surface elasticity facilitates the maintenance of a uniform film thickness. However, the existence of rigid, condensed surface films is detrimental to foam stability, owing to the very small changes in area over which such films show elasticity.<br>
A number of U.S. patents have previously been granted disclosing the use of foams and mousses as pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions, as drug delivery systems, and for skin care. The majority of these patents pertain to specific formulations containing specific drugs for treating specific disorders. Representative of this body of art are the following U.S. Patents.<br>

Each  of  these  patented  formulations  exhibits  certain<br><br>
disadvantages and/or deficiencies.

Further, the present inventive subject matter may beneficially affect the appearance, metabolic or functional state, or permeability of a tissue or living organism, resulting in improvements in the health of the living organism at the expense of an antagonist thereto, such as pathogenic organisms and other disease states involving cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, an "aerosol" is a pressurized dosage form containing one or more active ingredients, and which upon actuation emits a dispersion of liquid and/or solid materials in a gaseous medium. The dosage form is packaged under pressure in a suitable container equipped with a valve assembly. When the valve is opened, the internal pressure forces the aerosol out the valve.<br>
As used herein, "defoaming agent" or "foam inhibitor" refers<br><br>
to a solubilized surfactant, dispersion of hard particles, or dispersion of soft particles which interferes with foam formation or stability. Inhibition of foam production or stability may involve the addition of an insoluble liquid that is able to spread spontaneously, by virtue of surface-tension forces, over the surface of the foam films as they are formed. The spreading of the insoluble substance is so violent, and the spreading liquid drags along with it so much of the underlying film, that a hole is gouged in the film, which is thus destroyed. A liquid nonaqueous vehicle is generally present, even where the defoamer is represented as a solid formulation. A foam inhibitor typically provides a foam with quick-breaking attributes.<br>
As used herein, "effecting" refers to the process of producing an effect on biological activity, function, health, or condition of an organism in which such activity is maintained, enhanced, diminished, or treated in a manner consistent with the general health and well-being of the organism.<br>
As used herein, "enhancing" the biological activity, function, health, or condition of an organism refers to the process of augmenting, fortifying, strengthening, or improving.<br>
As used herein, "epithelium" or "epithelial" refers to the layer of cells forming the epidermis of the skin and the surface layer of mucous and serous membranes. Epithelial cells have the general functions of protection, absorption, and secretion. Epithelial cells are often in close proximity to blood vessels, although generally lacking in a direct blood supply.<br>
As used herein, "foam" refers to a coarse dispersion of gas in liquid in which the volume of the gas is considerably larger than that of the liquid. Accordingly, a foam is a tightly packed aggregation of gas bubbles, separated from each other by thin films of liquid (lamellae) . The existence and stability of a foam depends on a surface layer of solute molecules. At the surface of a liquid, molecules are in a state of dynamic equilibrium, in which the net attractive forces exerted by the<br><br>
bulk of the fluid cause molecules to move out of the surface; this motion is counterbalanced by ordinary diffusion back into the diluted surface layer. The equilibrium results in the surface layer being constantly less dense than the bulk fluid, which creates a state of tension at the surface. The tension can be somewhat relieved by adsorption of foreign molecules either out of the bulk solution, or out of the vapor phase.<br>
As used herein, "isomers" refer to different compounds that have the same molecular formula. "Stereoisomers" are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. "Enantiomers" are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. "Diastereoisomers" are stereoisomers which are not mirror images of each other. "Racemic mixture" means a mixture containing equal parts of individual enantiomers. "Non-racemic mixture" is a mixture containing unequal parts of individual enantiomers or stereoisom¬ers .<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable free bases, salts, esters, or solvates" refers to free bases, salts, esters, or solvates of subject compound(s) which possesses the same pharmacological activity as the subject compound(s) and which are neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. A salt, ester, or solvate can be formed with, for example, organic or inorganic acids. Non-limiting examples of suitable acids include acetic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, aspartic acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, bisulfic acid, boric acid, butyric acid, camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, digluconic acid, dodecylsulfic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, glyceric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycine, glucoheptanoic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, glycolic acid, hemisulfic acid, heptanoic acid, hexanoic acid, hippuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydroiodic acid, hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, lactic acid,<br><br>
maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, mucic acid, naphthylanesulfonic acid, naphthylic acid, nicotinic acid, nitrous acid, oxalic acid, pelargonic, phosphoric acid, propionic acid, saccharin, salicylic acid, sorbic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, thioglycolic acid, thiosulfuric acid, tosylic acid, undecylenic acid, ethanolamine, naturally and synthetically derived amino acids. Non-limiting examples of base salts, esters, or solvates include ammonium salts; alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium and magnesium salts; salts with organic bases, such as dicyclohexylamine salts; methyl-D-glucamine; and salts with amino acids, such as arginine, lysine, and so forth. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides, such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; asthma halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides; and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispers-ible products are thereby obtained.<br>
As used herein, "propellant" refers to a substance that provides the pressure to an aerosol composition that forces the composition out of a container in which it is stored when a valve on the container is opened. Propellants also influence the form of the discharged composition, i.e. foam, stream, or spray. There are two common types of propellants, liquefied gases and compressed gases.<br>
As used herein, "surface active agent" or "surfactant" refers to soluble substances that have a strong tendency to concentrate in the surface layer of a foam. Accordingly, a surface active agent will reduce interfacial surface tension at relatively low temperatures, making it easier for emulsification to take place.  The addition of a surface active agent, then,<br><br>
will stabilize the foam by increasing the surface and bulk viscosities of the system, which reduces drainage, and by forming a strong interfacial film around the bubbles, retarding coalescence if the bubbles do come into contact.<br>

(i) a solvent composition selected from the group consisting of water, a volatile propellant, a C1-C6fluid alkyl or branched alkyl alcohol, an aromatic alcohol, an ether of a sorbitol derivative, propylene carbonate, xylene, methylene chloride, ethylhexanediol, polysiloxanes, dimethyl ether, and mixtures thereof;<br>

(a) acetylsalicyclic acid, ascorbic acid, boric acid, carbonic acid, formic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, hippuric acid, hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, nitrous acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, saccharin, sorbic acid, sulfuric acid, thiosulfuric acid, undecylenic acid, ethanolamine, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or solvate thereof;<br><br><br>
(b)	an alpha hydroxyacid of formula I:<br>
(Ra) (Rb)C(OH)COOH	I<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, lactone, or solvate thereof wherein Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of H, F, CI, Br, and saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C25 alkyl, aralkyl, or aryl groups, wherein each of Ra and Rb may be optionally substituted with an OH, SH, CHO, COOH group;<br>
(c)	an alpha ketoacid of formula II:<br>
(Ra)COCOO(Rb)	II<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or solvate thereof wherein Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of H and saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C25 alkyl, aralkyl, or aryl groups, wherein Ra may be optionally substituted with an F, CI, Br, I, OH, CHO, COOH, or alkoxy group having 1 to 9 carbon atoms;<br>
(d)	an acid of formula III:<br><br>
or  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt,  ester,  or<br>
solvate thereof, wherein<br>
n is 0-6;<br>
X is H, OH, or NH2,<br>
each Y is H or OH,<br>
or X and Y are optionally taken together to form a 5-7<br>
membered saturated or unsaturated carbocyclic ring or<br>
a 5-7 membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic<br>
ring,  wherein  one  or  more  ring  atom(s)  of  said<br><br><br>
heterocyclic ring is 0, S, or N;<br>
Z is H, CH3, OH, COOH, or SH, provided that Y and Z are not both OH,<br>
or Y and Z are optionally taken together to form a 5-7<br>
membered saturated or unsaturated carbocyclic ring or<br>
a 5-7 membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic<br>
ring,  wherein  one  or more  ring  atom(s)  of  said<br>
heterocyclic ring is 0, S, or N; and<br>
(e)  mixtures thereof.<br>
The present inventive foamable delivery systems are capable<br>
of  forming  various  kinds  of  foams  for  administration  to<br>
epithelial cells of a mammal.  For example, the present delivery<br>
systems may form dilute foams consisting of nearly spherical<br>
bubbles separated by rather thick films of somewhat viscous<br>
liquid.   Similarly,  the present delivery systems may form<br>
concentrated foams that are mostly gas phase and consist of<br>
polyhedral gas cells separated by thin liquid films.   This<br>
concentrated foam may develop from the more dilute foam as a<br>
result of liquid drainage, or may develop directly from a liquid<br>
of relatively low viscosity.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventive foam delivery systems promote foam stability by improving spreadability. Spreadability is a function of surface tension of the composition. An increase in surface tension is accompanied by an increase in surface area. Accordingly, it is expected that the present inventive compositions having one or more surfactants that produce a higher surface tension will improve the spreadability of the compositions. Such improved spreadability allows more intimate contact between the active therapeutic agent contained in the foam and the tissues to which foam is delivered.<br>
The applied composition is initially in the form of a foam. The foam breaks down at physiological temperature to a liquid to allow the active therapeutic agent to saturate the treatment site.  Such a system provides enhanced contact and penetration of<br><br>
the active therapeutic agent through the epithelial cell layer. Because the inventive composition is supplied as a foam, the properties of the composition make it easier to handle and physically control. The foamable composition disintegrates easily when spread and heated by the body, providing proper coverage at the site to be treated without premature evaporation of the solvent.<br>
It would further be expected that the present foamable delivery systems maintain a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 5% of the starting concentration of the active therapeutic agent contained therein, or less than 5% of the label claim, whichever is more stringent. In a preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions can maintain a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 2% of the starting concentration of the active agent. In this regard, it should be noted that these foamable delivery systems maintain a concentration of degradation product(s) less than the threshold limit for degradation product(s) established by the International Council on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Additionally, the label claim used to calculate the amount of the less than 10% degradation products of the label claim is intended to encompass that amount of active ingredient actually incorporated into the product to support this label claim, i.e. any amount remaining within the legal limits. Similar requirements for product stability for veterinary products are also herein envisioned.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present inventive foamable delivery systems may optionally further comprise a foam inhibitor to aid in the spreading of the foam. Antifoaming agents (foam inhibitors) act against the various factors promoting foam stability. Accordingly, if rapid breakdown to a liquid state, as in a quick-breaking foam, and/or improved spreadability are desired, a foam inhibitor may be included in the present foam<br><br>
formulations.<br>

Propellants<br>
When the propellant is a liquefied gas or a mixture of liquefied gases, it frequently serves the dual role of propellant and solvent or vehicle for the product concentrate. As the propellant meets the air, it may immediately evaporate due to the drop in pressure, leaving the product concentrate as airborne liquid droplets or dry particles, or it may remain with the product droplets as a solvent for the product.<br>

dioxide and nitrous oxide), methylene chloride, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, said propellant is a volatile propellant that is dimethyl ether.<br>
Other propellants commonly known as useful in the preparation of foamable compositions are further contemplated as within the scope of the present inventive subject matter.<br>
When used in aerosols, compressed gases, in comparison to liquefied gases, have the advantages that they are odorless, colorless, low in toxicity, nonflammable, inexpensive, more pressure stable, and environmentally acceptable. These advantages need to be balanced against the compressed gas disadvantages, which include inferior spray characteristics, changes in spray characteristics during discharge, increased potential for loss of the gas, valve and actuator clogging, and increased potential for corrosion, in selecting the propellant for use in the present aerosols.<br>

In another preferred embodiment, said foamable pharmaceutical composition is administered topically to mucosal epithelial cell tissues of the mouth, ear, nasal passages, vagina, urethra, or rectum. Although the target of oral and nasal tissues may be such tissues themselves, oral and nasal preparations may also be absorbed and produce systemic effects.<br>
In certain instances and for local effects, drugs are inserted into the vagina, urethra, or rectum. Systemic drug effects may also result after the vaginal, urethral, or rectal application of drugs due to absorption of the drug from the mucous membranes of these sites. Aerosol foams can be used intravaginally in essentially the same manner as that employed for creams. The aerosol package contains an inserter device filled with foam. The inserter device is contents placed in the vagina where the contents thereof are released through activation of a plunger. Similarly, preparations of urethral or rectal foams use inserters for the presentation of the foam into the urethral or anal canal, respectively.<br>

carbocyclic ring or a 5-7 membered saturated or<br><br>

(B) packaging said mixture in a container suitable for storage and delivery of said composition.<br>
The compositions made according to this method are preferably in an aerosol dosage form suitable for topical application. Accordingly, said production method can additionally comprise the further step of charging the container with a propellant suitable to effect aerosol delivery of the composition from the container.<br>
The effectiveness of the present pharmaceutical aerosol formulations depends on achieving the proper combination of formulation, container, and valve assembly.<br>
The Container<br>
The instant foamable pharmaceutical compositions are preferably packaged in a container as an aerosol. The compositions may be packaged in the container using either a single-step or a multiple-step filling process commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The container must be selected to provide the aerosol formulation with a long shelf life. Accordingly, the container must be chemically inert with respect to the composition contained therein so as not to interfere with the stability of the formulation or with the integrity and operation of the container. Further, the container must be capable of withstanding the pressure required by the product, must be corrosive-resistant, and must be resistant to physical or chemical changes to the product contained therein that may, for example, form particles clogging the orifice. This is particularly important as the present compositions contain a surfactant and an acid, two components known to increase the potential for corrosion.<br><br><br>
The selection of a suitable container for the aerosol product is based on its adaptability to production methods, compatibility with formulation components, ability to sustain the pressure intended for the product, the interest in design and aesthetic appeal on the part of the manufacturer, and cost. Suitable containers may be made of, for example, steel, aluminum, glass, plastic, or mixtures thereof. The containers may further employ one or more protective coatings such as, for example, sodium nitrate, sodium benzoate, ammonium m-nitrobenzoate, morpholine, 2-methyl butynoyl, Expoxol 9-5, sodium n-lauroylsarcosinate, phenolic, epoxy, or vinyl coatings, to enhance the formulation compatibility or safe handling. Any other known aerosol containers and protective coatings are further contemplated as useful in this regard.<br>
The container may also comprise two or more compartments permitting the final composition to be broken up into separate portions that are physically separated until dispensed from the container through the valve assembly.<br>
Known methods for filling aerosol containers with foamable compositions include processes known as cold fill, under the cup, and pressure fill (through the valve). Such methods for filling an aerosol container are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and may be found in The Aerosol Handbook (Wayne E. Dorland, Caldwell, NJ) and the Handbook of Aerosol Technology, (R.E. Krieger, Malabar, FL) , both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
In the cold filling method, both the product concentrate and the propellant must be cooled to temperatures of -30° to -40°F. The chilled product concentrate is quantitatively metered into an equally cold aerosol container, then the cold, liquefied gas is added. When sufficient propellant has been added, the valve assembly is placed on the container.<br>
In the under the cap filling method, a filling head that forms a tight seal on the container shoulder is utilized.  The<br><br>
filling head holds the valve above the container while propellant under pressure is added through the opening in the container.<br>
In the pressure filling method, the product concentrate is quantitatively placed in the container, the valve assembly is placed on the container, and the liquefied gas, under pressure, is metered through the valve stem into the container. Pressure filling is used for most pharmaceutical aerosols.<br>
Valve Assembly<br>
The function of the valve assembly is to permit the expulsion of the contents of the can in the desired form, at the desired rate, and, in the case of metered valves, in the proper amount or dose. Accordingly, the valve assembly must contribute to the form of the product to be emitted. In particular, aerosol foam valves typically have a large-diameter delivery spout to permit the delivery of the foam. Further, the valve assembly permits the aerosol composition to be released from the container either via continuous delivery or as a metered dose.<br>
The materials used in the manufacture of the valve assembly must be inert towards the aerosol formulations that pass therethrough. Among the materials that can be used in the manufacture of the various valve parts are plastic, rubber, aluminum, stainless steel, and mixtures thereof. The usual aerosol valve assembly is composed of the following parts: actuator, stem, gasket, spring, mounting cup, housing, and dip tube. Valves may also be employed that permit emission of product while the container is upright or inverted. All types of valve assemblies known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including spray valves, sliding gasket valves, deflecting gasket valves, and tilt action valves, are contemplated as capable of delivering the present inventive compositions.<br>
Metering valves are designed to deliver specific quantities of a product each time the valve is actuated. Meter valves are usually employed when the formulation is a potent medication or in other instances where a precise dosing is desired.  In metered<br><br>
ralve systems, an auxiliary valve chamber regulates the amount of material discharged by virtue of its capacity or dimensions.<br>
The valve assembly may further accommodate an attachment to facilitate delivery of the present inventive foamable pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Methods of Delivery<br>
The present inventive subject matter further relates to a method of delivering a foamable pharmaceutical composition from a container comprising providing an expelling force generated by mechanical means to said foamable pharmaceutical composition, said foamable pharmaceutical composition comprising:<br>
(i) an effective amount of one or more active therapeutic<br>
agents or pharmaceutically acceptable free bases, salts,<br>
esters, or solvates thereof;<br>

(iii) an acid in an amount to affect the composition's pH<br><br><br>
cted from the group consisting of:<br>
(a)	acetylsalicyclic acid, ascorbic acid, boric acid,<br>
carbonic acid, formic acid, ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, hippuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid,<br>
nitrous acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, saccharin,<br>
sorbic acid, sulfuric acid, thiosulfuric acid,<br>
undecylenic acid, ethanolamine, and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, ester, or solvate thereof;<br>
(b)	an alpha hydroxyacid of formula I:<br>
(Ra) (Rb)C(OH)COOH	I<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, lactone, or solvate thereof wherein Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of H, F, CI, Br, and saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C25 alkyl, aralkyl, or aryl groups, wherein each of Ra and Rb may be optionally substituted with an OH, SH, CHO, COOH group;<br>
(c)	an alpha ketoacid of formula II:<br>
(Ra)COCOO(Rb)	II<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or solvate thereof wherein Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of H and saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C25 alkyl, aralkyl, or aryl groups, wherein Ra may be optionally substituted with an F, C1, Br, I, OH, CHO, COOH, or alkoxy group having 1 to 9 carbon atoms;<br><br>
(d)	an acid of formula III:<br><br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable  salt,  ester,  or solvate thereof, wherein n is 0-6;<br>
X is H, OH, or NH2, each Y is H or OH,<br>
or X and Y are optionally taken together to form a 5-7 membered saturated or unsaturated carbocyclic ring or a 5-7 membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring, wherein one or more ring atom(s) of said heterocyclic ring is 0, S, or N;<br>
Z is H, CH3, OH, COOH, or SH, provided that Y and Z are not both OH,<br>
or Y and Z are optionally taken together to form a 5-7<br>
membered saturated or unsaturated carbocyclic ring or<br>
a 5-7 membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic<br>
ring,  wherein  one  or more  ring  atom(s)  of  said<br>
heterocyclic ring is 0, S, or N; and<br>
(e)  mixtures thereof.<br>
The expelling force used to deliver the composition from a<br>
container can take the form of pressure applied to the aerosol<br>
system through the use of one or more liquefied or gaseous<br>
propellants.  Alternatively, the composition may be expelled from<br>
the container through the use of a compressed gas generated by<br>
mechanical means, such as by a pump action or a squeezing action<br>
on the container.   Other expelling forces known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art are further contemplates as within the<br>
scope of the present inventive subject matter.<br>
Upon activation of the valve assembly, it is the pressure exerted by the propellant which forces the contents of the package out through the opening of the valve. This expelling force allows the present inventive compositions to be delivered as a fine mist; a coarse, wet or a dry spray; a steady stream; or as a stable or breaking foam. The contemplated foams include those intended for deposition on the skin or for instillation<br><br><br>
into a body cavity, such as vaginal foams, urethral foams, oral and aural foams, and rectal foams.<br>
The pressure of an aerosol is critical to its performance. It can be controlled by 1) the type and amount of propellant and 2) the nature and amount of material comprising the product concentrate. Thus, each formulation is unique, and a specific amount of propellant to be employed in aerosol products is determined by the skilled practitioner. In general, foam aerosols usually operate between about 10 to about 200 psig at 70° F, preferably between about 13 and about 108 psig at 70° F and more preferably between about 20 and about 80 psig at 70° F. Further, foam aerosols may contain about 1 to about 90% propellant, preferably from about 2 to about 50% propellant, and more preferably between about 2.5 and about 20% propellant.<br>
Advantages to Aerosol Delivery Systems<br>
When formulated as pharmaceutical aerosol foams, the present inventive compositions exhibit several properties that may be considered advantages over other types of dosage forms. These include:<br>
1.	A portion of medication may be easily withdrawn from the<br>
package without contamination or exposure to the remaining<br>
material.<br>
2.	By virtue of its hermetic character, the aerosol<br>
container protects medicinal agents adversely affected by<br>
atmospheric oxygen and moisture. Being opaque, the usual aerosol<br>
containers also protect drugs adversely affected by light. This<br>
protection persists during the use and the shelf-life of the<br>
product. If the product is packaged under sterile conditions,<br>
sterility may also be maintained during the shelf-life of the<br>
product.<br>
3.	Topical medication may be applied in a uniform, thin<br>
layer to epithelial cell tissues, without touching the affected<br>
area. This method of application may reduce the irritation that<br>
sometimes accompanies the mechanical (fingertip) application of<br><br>
topical preparations.  The rapid volatilization of the propellant also provides a cooling, refreshing effect.<br>
4.	By proper formulation and valve control, the physical<br>
form and the particle size of the emitted product may be<br>
controlled, contributing to the efficacy of the drug. For<br>
example, a transdermal drug is expected to have greater efficacy<br>
when maintained in contact with epithelial cell tissues for a<br>
longer period of time and when transported in a vehicle which<br>
enhances absorption.<br>
5.	Aerosol application is a "clean" process, requiring<br>
little or no "wash-up" by the user.<br>
6.	Through the use of metered valves, dosage may be<br>
controlled.<br>
Dosage<br>
Appropriate dosage levels for the active therapeutic agents contemplated in the present inventive subject matter are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Dosage levels on the order of about 0.001 mg to about 5,000 mg per kilogram body weight of the active therapeutic compounds or compositions are known to be useful in the treatment of the diseases, disorders, and conditions contemplated in the present invention. Typically, this effective amount of the active therapeutic agents will generally comprise from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of patient body weight per day. Moreover, it will be understood that this dosage of active therapeutic agents can be administered in a single or multiple dosage units to provide the desired therapeutic effect. If desired, other therapeutic agents can be employed in conjunction with those provided by the present inventive subject matter.<br>
The present inventive compositions may be given in a single or multiple doses daily. In a preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions are given from one to three times daily. Starting with a low dose twice daily and slowly working up to higher doses if needed is a preferred strategy.  The amount of<br><br>
active ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
It is understood, however, that a specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors well known in the art, including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; drug combination; the severity of the particular disorder being treated; and the form of administration. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate the variability of such factors and would be able to establish specific dose levels using no more than routine experimentation.<br>
The optimal pharmaceutical formulations will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon considerations such as the particular drug or drug combination and the desired dosage. See, for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 18th ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042), pp. 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the therapeutic agents.<br>

heated or cooled to a temperature above or below ambient, combined at sub- or super-atmospheric pressure, or combined under a specialized atmosphere, such as pure nitrogen or oxygen.<br>
The concentrate is then filled into an aerosol container, such as an aluminum tube, and the propellant added via conventional procedures, such as through-the-valve or under-the-cup methods of charging. The finished aerosol dispensing system additionally employs a suitable valve and applicator nozzle that permit the medicament to be administered in close proximity to the area to be treated, externally or within a body cavity.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The following example illustrates a generally applicable method for administering a composition of the present inventive subject matter:<br>
A foamable pharmaceutical composition is administered topically to the skin of the patient being treated by conventional means. This is preferably done through the use of an aerosol package. Such aerosol packages designed for topical delivery to epithelial cell tissues are convenient and often result in higher patient compliance. A topical preparation may thus be applied to the desired surface area with or without the use of the fingertips, making the procedure less messy than with most other types of topical preparations.<br>
For topical administration of aerosol dosage forms, the patient should be told to first clean the affected area gently and to pat it dry. Product may then be applied directly to the affected area or dispensed into the palm of the hand or suitable vessel from which material may be taken and manually applied to the area to be treated. The patient should allow the product applied to dry and not cover the area with a bandage or dressing unless instructed to do so by the physician. The patient should avoid accidentally instilling or bringing the product into contact with the eyes or mouth.<br><br>
