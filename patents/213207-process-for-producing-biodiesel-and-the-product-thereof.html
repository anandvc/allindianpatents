The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention, in general, relates to an improved process for production of biodiesel and the product thereof. More specifically, but without restriction to the particular embodiments hereinafter described in accordance with the best mode of practice, this invention relates to a single pot process for production of biodiesel using non-edible oil sources containing free fatty acids.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Environmental problems coupled with petroleum reserve depletion stimulated research to develop the renewable transportation fuels. Biodiesel is one of the candidates, which has similar combustion properties as diesel and is being used in the United States of America (USA) and in the Europe, with a view to reduce the air pollution, to support agriculture and to reduce dependence on the fossil fuel, which are limited resources and localized to some specific regions.<br>
The use of biodiesel in conventional diesel engines results in substantial reduction of un-burnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matters. Biodiesel is considered as a clean fuel as it has almost no sulphur, no aromatics and has about 10% built-in oxygen, which helps it to burn fully. Its higher cetane number improves the ignition quality even in blends with petroleum diesel.<br>
Fatty Acids Methyl Esters (FAME) have properties very similar to petroleum diesel and so known as biodiesel. These esters can be made from virgin or used vegetable oils or animal fats and can be used as a blend in petroleum diesel. Sunflower and rapeseed are used as the raw materials in Europe, whereas soybean is used in USA and Thailand. In Malaysia what is typically used is Palm Oil. However, the edible oil production in several countries is inadequate to cover the total domestic requirement. As for example India is a net importer of edible oils. Therefore, in such countries the production of biodiesel from edible oils is not economically viable..<br>
The USA and the Europe use their surplus edible oils like soybean oil, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil as feedstocks for purposes of biodiesel production. In India, however, for<br>
2<br><br>
want of surplus edible oil, the aforesaid oils cannot be utilized for the production of biodiesel. However, India has a tropical advantage with 80-100 million hectare of wasteland and several species capable of giving oil-bearing seeds are known. Jatropha curcas (Ratanjot, Wild Castor, Jangli Erandi), Madhuca indica (Mohuwa) and Pongamia pinnata (Karanj, Honge) are some such plant species, which can thrive on any type of soil, needs minimum input and post plantation management, and have low moisture demand. Their oil content is quite high about 25-35 %, which justify them to be a choice for energy crops.<br>
However, India has large arable land as well as good tropical conditions with adequate rainfall in large parts of the area to account for large biomass production each year. Additionally, there is large junk of degraded forestland and un-utilised public land, field boundaries and fallow land of farmers where non-edible oil-seeds can be produced. There are many tree species, bearing seeds rich in oil like Jatropha Curcas and Pongamia Pinnata, which are promising candidates for production of biodiesel.<br>
Processes for producing biodiesel employing different catalysts have been reported in the prior art. These catalysts could be basic, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, potassium ethoxide or acidic, e.g. sulfuric acid. Biocatalysts like lipases have also been employed for biodiesel synthesis. Solid acid catalysts like alumina and clay have also been used as catalysts in the biodiesel production. Different experimental parameters have been used to develop the process for production of biodiesel.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,525,126 to Basu et al. discloses esterification of a mixture of fats and oils using a calcium acetate-barium acetate catalyst. However, the matter requires elevated temperature, in excess of 200°C, and elevated pressure of approx 500 psi. These conditions render the esterification process impractical and uneconomical for industrial scale production.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,713,965 to Fogia et al. discloses the use of lipases in the transesterification of triglyceride containing substances and free fatty acids. The conversion rate of only 95% is reported, which cannot yield biodiesel as per the international specifications.<br>

German Patent No. DE10245758 to Rethmann Klemens discloses a process for production of biodiesel by reacting a branched monohydric alcohol with a fat having a low unsaturated fatty acid content in the presence of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
The formation of biodiesel by the base catalyzed reaction of vegetable oil with methanol is a two-phase reaction and is known to be slow. Methanolysis is understood to occur only in the methanol phase. Low oil concentration in methanol slows the reaction rate and a slow dissolving rate of the oil in the methanol causes an initiation period. As the concentration increases, the reaction rate also increases. However, the reaction rate subsequently decreases and the reaction tends to stop by completion. This problem gets further aggravated if the vegetable oil contains free fatty acids (FFA). The presence of FFA in the oil leads to formation of soap and emulsion leading to much more processing time and lower yield.<br>
Thus improvements in the processes for the production of biodiesel are required, in particular for the production of biodiesel from non-edible vegetable oils, which contain substantial amount of free fatty acids. Base catalysed reactions with free fatty acid containing oils lead to formation of excessive emulsions, resulting in lower yield and effluent. Acid catalysed reactions are time consuming.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is directed at a single-pot synthesis process, which produces biodiesel employing a water scavanger, without the process complications of the prior art processes.<br>

acid methyl esters, wherein the traces of acidic catalyst of first esterification step is neutralized with basic catalyst of the second trans-esterification step, yielding water soluble salt, which is washed away during final work-up procedures.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention involves the selection and identification of the plant species capable of giving oil-bearing seeds to produce biodiesel, which can thrive on any type of soil, needs minimum input and post plantation management, and has low moisture demand. Their oil content is quite high about 25-35 %, which justify them to be a choice for energy crops.<br>
Disclosed plant species in the present invention are non-edible vegetable oils selected from the group comprising Jatropha curcas (Ratanjot, Wild Castor, Jangli Erandi), Madhuca indica (Mohuwa) and Pongamia pinnata (Karanj, Honge).<br>
The disclosed embodiment of the present invention deals with a process for the production of biodiesel that has advantages of avoiding lower yield and effluent and provides the time efficient single pot process, which produces biodiesel, without the process complications.<br>
The present invention is directed at a process for the production of fatty acid esters for use as biodiesel, from a feedstock comprising of non-edible vegetable oils from tree borne oil seeds. These tree borne oils contain some amount of free fatty acids, which create emulsification by forming alkali metal salts with the basic catalysts. In acid catalysed process, the reaction times are quite long, making the process un-economic. According to the present invention, there is provided an improved process where the process is carried out employing both acidic and basic catalysis in a single pot, avoiding the drawbacks of both of them.<br>
Use of a column packed with water scavanger to trap the byproduct water is an important feature in the present invention. The esterification reaction yields water as a byproduct, which makes the process reversible. In order to direct the reaction in forward direction, the vapors of methanol and water azeotrope are passed through a column, packed with a water<br>
8<br><br>
scavanger. This facilitates the speedier conversion of free fatty acids to their methyl esters, leaving only fatty acid methyl ester and triglycerides in the reaction mixture.<br>
The water scavanger used in the present invention is selected from the group comprising 2,2-dimethoxypropane, phosphorous trichloride, zeolites, silica gel, acidic clay or molecular sieves.<br>
The intermediate mixture of fatty acid methyl ester and triglyceride obtained after esterification is reacted with methanol in the presence of a basic catalyst. This second step is commenced, only when, the intermediate reaction mixture is free from free fatty acids of vegetable oils. This base catalysed reaction trans-esterify triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters.<br>
In the process of the present invention, free fatty acids present in the starting triglyceride mixture are esterified with a molar excess (relative to the fatty acids) of a lower monoalcohol, i.e., an alkanol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, in the presence of an acidic esterification catalyst and water scavenger or adsorbent. The preferred alcohol for this pre-esterification step is methanol or ethanol. Comparatively mild reaction conditions are selected for this process, so that transesterification of triglycerides takes place only to a limited extent, if at all it does.<br>
The ratio between free fatty acid (FFA) and methanol is best selected so that, a distinct molar excess of methanol is provided relative to the free fatty acid content to be esterified. Generally, to achieve the results, from about 10% to 50% by volume of methanol is normally used, based on the percentage of FFA in oil. Preferred amounts for this pre-esterification reaction are about 15% to 40% by volume with the most preferred being about 20% by volume. These ratios roughly correspond to molar ratios of methanol (lower monoalcohol) to free fatty acid of about 5:1 to 50:1 depending on the nature and acid number of the triglyceride starting material. Preferably a molar ratio of about 6:1 to 20:1 is employed.<br>
Larger quantities of methanol have a positive effect upon the rate and completeness of the esterification using a water scavenger or an adsorbent of the free fatty acids. Even though the solubility of methanol in natural triglycerides is constant for a given reaction<br>
9<br><br>
temperature, it has been found that, to a certain extent, an increase in the quantity of methanol used produces more rapid and more complete esterification of the free fatty acids.<br>
The reaction temperature can be varied between about the boiling point of the monoalcohol down to about 20°C below the boiling point. For example, when methanol is used, the reaction temperature should be within the range of about 55°C to 65°C.<br>
Although the present invention is not intended to be limited to any particular procedure for transesterifying the pre-esterified triglyceride mixture, the anhydrous triglycerides recovered from the process of the present invention preferably are subjected to atmospheric alkali catalyzed transesterification at a reaction temperature in the range of from about 30°C to 120°C in a known manner with a lower monoalcohol, e.g., an alkanol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The reaction is conducted at substantially atmospheric pressure and it is preferred to carry out the reaction at the reflux temperature of the alcohol employed, e.g., for methanol, at about 65°C, reaction times between about 10 to 60 minutes being typical. Preferred is the same monoalcohol used in the pre-esterification step of the present invention. The most preferred monoalcohol for both steps is methanol and for convenience, the transesterification step will be described briefly with reference thereto.<br>
The transesterification reaction can be carried out batch wise or continuously in any of the many known non-pressurized reaction systems. In general, the methanol is used in a 50% to 150% excess over the stoichiometric quantity required for the transesterification reactions. The transesterification reaction should be carried out with substantially anhydrous methanol. Suitable catalysts for transesterification include alkali metal hydroxides, particularly sodium and potassium hydroxide, and alkali metal alcoholates, particularly sodium methylate. Over and above the quantity required to neutralize any free fatty acids, the catalysts are used in quantities of from about 0.05 to 0.2 percent by weight based on the triglycerides. Preferred are catalyst quantities of from about 0.1 to 0.2 percent by weight, with about 0.15 percent by weight being most preferred.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner. It is understood that the variations of the<br>

The soxhlet apparatus was filled with silica gel (6-20 mesh, 50 g). Jatropha curcas oil (1000 g) having 10% free fatty acid (FFA) was charged to the reactor. Subsequently methanol (175 g) and sulfuric acid (3.0 g) were added slowly to the reactor with stirring. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 h through soxhlet apparatus. Reaction mixture was cooled to 50°C and a solution of sodium hydroxide (9.0 g) in methanol (40 g) was added to the reactor. Temperature of the reactor was raised to 65°C and refluxing was continued through the soxhlet apparatus for 1 h. The soxhlet apparatus was detached and the excess methanol (80 g) was distilled off. The reaction mixture was transferred to 2000 ml of separating funnel and both the phases were separated. Upper phase was biodiesel and lower that of glycerin. The glycerin phase was neutralized with dilute HC1 and stored as crude glycerin. Upper phase was washed with hot saline water (2 x 300 g) to remove the traces of glycerin, catalyst and soap formed during the reaction to yield biodiesel (980 g) meeting the international specifications.<br>
