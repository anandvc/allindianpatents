[Title of the Invention]    OPERATION CONTROLLING SYSTEM FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine and, particularly, to a technology for realizing an improvement of fuel economy and an improvement of emission performance.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0 002]<br>
Under a situation that further demands toward improvements in fuel economy and emission performance for internal combustion engines including those carried on vehicles are raised, reduction in costs are also important in order to realize the spread of internal combustion engines meeting such demands.<br>
There is known, fox example, an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, which is provided with a throttle valve angle sensor detecting the opening of a throttle valve, a time detecting section detecting time required in order that a crankshaft revolves through a predetermined crank angle, and an air-fuel ratio controlling section setting the amount of fuel supplied from a fuel injection nozzle functioning as an  air-fuel mixture forming section forming an air-fuel mixture, wherein the air-fuel ratio controlling section performs control to set the fuel amount  on the basis of the opening<br><br>
of the throttle valve and control to set the fuel amount on the basis of an intake air amount calculated from time detected by the time detecting section, by switching these controls according to the operation range of the internal combustion engine (refer to Patent Document 1, for example). [0003]<br>
According to this operation controlling system^ in order to set the amount of supply of fuel, the intake air amount is detected from the time detected by the time detecting section, so that an air flow meter and an intake pressure sensor become unnecessary and the cost of the operation controlling system is reduced.<br>
Also, there is well known an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, which is provided, in order to realize an improvement of fuel economy and an improvement of emission performance, with an engine condition detecting section detecting the condition of the internal combustion engine and an air-fuel ratio sensor (for example, an oxygen concentration sensor) detecting an air-fuel ratio from the components of exhaust gas, sets the basic amount of the supply amount of fuel supplied from an air-fuel mixture forming section on  the basis of the detected condition of the internal combustion engine, and corrects the basic amount of the fuel supply amount on the basis of the detected air-fuel ratio to set the fuel amount.<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2004-108289 [Disclosure of the Invention]<br><br>
[0004]<br>
Meanwhile, in a four-stroke internal combustion engine, large combustion energy (positive energy) is generated in a combustion stroke.  On the other hand, energy is absorbed due to exhaust resistance in an exhaust stroke, energy is absorbed due to intake resistance in an intake stroke, and energy is absorbed due to compression resistance in a compression stroke.  That is, in the exhaust stroke, the intake stroke, and the compression stroke, negative energy is generated.  Moreover, as the negative energy, energy absorption occurs due to mechanical frictional-resistance.<br>
Moreover, the amount of the negative energy in the compression stroke is larger than the amount of the negative energy in the exhaust stroke.  This difference between the energy amounts becomes a valve reflecting energy required in the compression of the intake air, namely, a value reflecting compression resistance. [0005]<br>
On the other hand, in the low load range, namely, at the time of low output operation, an exhaust loss is very small, so that the amount of the negative energy in the exhaust resistance is considered to occur due to frictional resistance.<br>
Consequently, the angular velocity of the crankshaft leads to varying in each of the combustion stroke, the exhaust stroke, the intake stroke, and the compression<br><br>
combustion engine.<br>
Meanwhile, when the engine revolution number is made same, the more the intake air amount is, or the larger torque which the internal combustion engine produces is, the angular velocity of the crankshaft considerably varies.<br>
Moreover, in the case where the engine revolution number is constant, there is a linearly strong correlation between the variation amount of the angular velocity and the intake air amount.<br>
Therefore, if the engine revolution number is determined, it is possible to estimate the intake air amount from the variation amount of the angular velocity.<br>
However, in a case where the control is considered to be performed without resort to the air-fuel ratio sensor, if the engine revolution number considerably varies after the detection of the engine revolution number, there is a possibility that the detected air intake amount will deviate, and it is demanded that estimation accuracy of the air intake amount is further improved.<br>
Concretely, when an actual engine revolution number at the time of the detection of the angular velocity of the crankshaft is large relative to an engine revolution number value used for calculation, there is a possibility that an air intake amount to be calculated will become less than an air intake amount to be actually required.  Consequently, the ignition timing is set to a timing earlier than an ignition timing actually required.<br><br>
number at the time of the detection of the angular velocity of the crankshaft is small relative to the engine revolution number value used for calculation, there is a possibility that the air intake amount to be detected will become more than the air intake amount to be actually required.  Consequently, the ignition timing is set to a timing later than the ignition timing actually required.<br>
Moreover, in the past, in a case where the angular velocity of the crankshaft is detected utilizing a reluctor and a pickup, the angular velocity, etc. are adapted to be calculated as a reluctor electrical-angle corresponding to a detected pulse width, utilizing a predetermined fixed-value, so that there is a possibility that, in the light of the control, the reluctor electrical-angle detected by the reluctor and the pickup which are actually carried on a vehicle is not always equal to a predetermined reluctor electrical-angle due to any error in the reluctor or the pickup (mass-production tolerance such as dimensional error and detection error), and there is room for improving detection accuracy of a loading condition of the internal combustion engine. [0006]<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, v^hich can appropriately calculate the loading condition of the engine (for example, intake air amount) to perform a more suitable operation control (for<br><br>
air-fuel ration sensor, even if the variation of the engine revolution number is large.  Moreover, it is to provide an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, which can  decrease the influence of the error such as the tolerance at the time of mass-producing the reluctor or the pickup, improve the detection accuracy of the loading condition of the internal combustion engine, and perform a more suitable operation control. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0007]<br>
In order to address the above-mentioned problems, according to a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, comprising a flywheel coupled to a crankshaft, a reluctor coupled to the flywheel and used for measuring a revolution number of the crankshaft, etc., a rotation-detecting means detecting passage of the reluctor, and a control section calculating, from detection results by the rotation-detecting means, an average revolution number in a predetermined period and a partial crank angular velocity of the crankshaft that corresponds to a reluctor width, and determining an ignition period on the basis of these calculation results, wherein the control section simultaneously perform the calculation of the crank angular velocity in a period in which the average revolution number is calculated in a stroke prior to a compression stroke in which ignition is to be performed. [0008]<br><br>
According to the above-mentioned configuration, the control section simultaneously performs the calculation of the crank angular velocity in the stroke prior to the compression stroke in which the ignition is to be performed, so that the conditions of an engine at the time of calculating an average revolution number of the engine and at the time of the calculating of the crank angular velocity can be considered to be same and, even if variation in the engine revolution number is large, the calculations are hard to be subjected to its influence and it is possible to appropriately calculate an air intake amount. [0009]<br>
Moreover, according to a second embodiment of the present invention, in the first embodiment, the control section calculates the average revolution number of the engine and the crank angular velocity in a compression stroke just prior to the stroke in which the ignition is to be performed.<br>
According to the above-mentioned configuration, when an ignition timing is to be determined, the determination of the ignition timing is performed on the basis of the average revolution number of the engine and the crank angular velocity which are detected in the combustion stroke just prior to the stroke in which the ignition is to be performed, so that it is possible to more appropriately determine the ignition timing. [0010]<br><br>
According to a third embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, comprising a flywheel coupled to a crankshaft, a reluctor coupled to the flywheel and used for measuring a revolution number of the crankshaft, etc., a rotation-detecting means detecting passage of the reluctor, and a control section calculating, from detection results by the rotation-detecting means, an average revolution number in a predetermined period and a partial crank angular velocity of the crankshaft that corresponds to a reluctor width, and determining a load of the internal combustion engine on the basis of these calculation results, wherein the control section calculates a reluctor electrical-angle T3 corresponding to the reluctor width, on the basis of an angular velocity ωx at the time of detection of passage of the reluctor and an angular velocity coy at the time of non-detection of the passage of the reluctor, and calculaLes the crank angular velocity ω by dividing the reluctor electrical-angle T3 by a passage detection time Tx. [0011]<br>
According to the above-mentioned configuration, the control section calculates the reluctor electrical-angle T3 corresponding to the reluctor width, on the basis of the angular velocity ωx at the time of the detection of the passage of the reluctor and the angular velocity coy at the time of the non-detection of the passage of the reluctor, and calculates the crank angular velocity GO by dividing the<br><br>
reluctor electrical-angle T3 by the passage detection time Tx.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to calculate the reluctor electrical-angle in a state where the influence of an error (for example, mass-production tolerance) in the reluctor or the rotation-detecting means is eliminated and it is, therefore, possible to calculate the crank angular velocity in which the influence of the error is eliminated. [0012]<br>
Moreover, according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, in the third embodiment, the control section determines a reluctor angle Dx on the basis of the angular velocity ωx at the time of the passage detection and the passage detection time Tx, determines an angle Dy other than the reluctor angle Dx on the basis of the angular velocity coy at the time of the passage non-detection and a passage non-detection time Ty, and calculates the reluctor electrical-angle T3 by an equation (1) .<br>
T3 = {Dx / (Dx + Dy) } x 360 [deg]       (1)<br>
According to the above-mentioned configuration, it is possible to easily calculate the reluctor electrical-angle T3 and it is, therefore, possible to easily calculate the crank angular velocity in which the influence of the error is eliminated. [0013]<br>
According to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, in the fourth embodiment, a second reluctor is<br><br>
provided at a position ahead of the reluctor by a predetermined angle, and the control section calculates, from the detection results by the rotation-detecting means, an angular velocity QA in a period between a previous detection-starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and a succeeding detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, and an angular velocity coB in a period between a recent detection-starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and a succeeding detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, calculates an angular velocity ol at a previous detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, an angular velocity coc at a previous detection-finishing timing of the passage of the reluctor, and an angular velocity coO at the recent detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, on the basis of the angular velocities uA and oB, and calculates the reluctor angle Dx and the angle Dy by equations (2)-(5) on the basis of the passage detection time Tx and the passage non-detection time Ty.<br>
ox   =    (col   +   coc)    /   2	•••    (2)<br>
coy   =    (uc   +   coO)    /   2	•■•    (3)<br>
Dx   =   Tx   X   ux	•••    (4)<br>
Dy   =   Ty   X   coy	•••    (5)<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the above-mentioned configuration, the second reluctor is provided at the position ahead of the reluctor by the predetermined angle, and the angular velocity coA in the period between the previous detection-<br><br>
starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and the succeeding detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, and the angular velocity coB in the period between the recent detection-starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and the succeeding detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor are detected, whereby the angular velocities «A, oB are obtained as a basis for the calculation of the reluctor electrical-angle T3, it is possible to easily calculate the reluctor electrical-angle T3 by arithmetic operation based on the angular velocities coA, GOB serving as the basis and it is therefore possible to easily calculate the crank angular velocity in which the influence of the error is eliminated. [Effect of the Invention] [0015]<br>
According to the present invention, even in a state where the change of the engine revolution number is large, it is possible to easily collect data such a highly reliable angular velocity at a suitable timing and easily realize a operation control such as calculation of the intake air amount. [0016]<br>
Next, a preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be explained hereinafter with reference to the drawings.<br>

The combustion gas within the combustion chamber 4 after driving the piston 3 flows, as an exhaust gas, into the exhaust pipe 15 via an exhaust port 2e, which is provided at the cylinder head 2, at the time of opening of an exhaust valve 14 adapted to be driven by the valve gear device 23 to open ^^"i'""='= I'he exhaust port 2e.<br><br>
[0020]<br>
In addition to the fuel injection nozzle 20 provided at the intake pipe 12, the operation controlling system controlling an operation condition of the internal combustion engine E is provided with an ignition device 21 provided with the spark plug 21a, an exhaust gas refluxing device 22 refluxing a portion of the exhaust gas into the intake air path 5a, the valve gear device 23 provided with a camshaft which is rotation-driven in synchronization with the crankshaft 7 and closes/opens the intake valve 13 and the exhaust valve 14, an engine-condition detecting section detecting a condition of the internal combustion engine E, and an electronic control unit (ECU) 24 provided with control sections 40-43 which respectively control the fuel injection nozzle 20, the ignition device 21, the exhaust gas refluxing device 22 and the valve gear device 23, according to the condition of the engine which is detected by the engine-condition detecting section.<br>
[0021]<br>
The ECU 24 is configured as a computer which is provided with an input/output interface, a central arithmetic processing unit (CPU), and a storage device 24a having ROM in which various control programs and various maps Mb, Mo, Ms, Mi, Me, Mv, etc. are memorized, and RAM in which various data, etc. are temporarily memorized.<br>
The valve gear device 23 is a variable valve gear device which is provided with a valve characteristic variable mechanism 23a which causes at least one of a valve<br><br>

The engine-condition detecting section is provided /\?ith a crank angle sensor 25 serving as a rotation angle sensor detecting a rotation position of the crankshaft 7 (hereinafter referred to as "crank position"), a revolution number detecting section 31 detecting, on the basis of an output of the crank angle sensor 25, an average engine revolution number Ne which is the average number of revolutions of the internal combustion engine E, a variation amount detecting section 32 detecting an amount Aco of variation in angular velocity u (refer to Fig. 2) of the crankshaft 7 on the basis of the output of the crank angle sensor 25, a throttle valve-opening sensor 26 detecting the opening a.   of the throttle valve 11, an O2 sensor 27 which is an oxygen concentration sensor serving as an air-fuel ratio sensor detecting an air-fuel ratio from oxygen which is the component of the exhaust gas, a warming-up condition detecting section 33 detecting a warming-up condition of the internal combustion engine E, a trouble detecting section 34 detecting troubles of the throttle valve-opening sensor 26 and O2 sensor 27, an engine-temperature detecting section detecting engine temperatures including the temperature of cooling water or lubricating oil of the internal combustion engine E, etc.,<br><br>
sections respectively detecting a starting time point, an accelerating time point and a decelerating time point, etc. [0023]<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic explanatory view illustrating relationships between respective strokes of the internal combustion engine, and a reluctor, pulse and the angular velocity of the crankshaft.  Furthermore, Fig. 3 is a detailed explanatory view illustrating the relationships between the respective strokes of the internal combustion engine, and the reluctor, the pulse and the angular velocity of the crankshaft.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3 together, the crank angle sensor 2 5 is configured to have a reluctor 25a which is a portion to be detected and is provided at a flywheel 8 which is a rotor integrally provided at the crankshaft 7, a second reluctor 25a2, and a pickup 25b serving as a detection portion provided at the engine body.  A detection signal from the crank angle sensor 25 is inputted into the ECU 24.  The reluctor 25a is provided in a range of a predetermined crank angle 0 (corresponding to a reluctor electrical-angle T3) determined on the basis of a position corresponding to the crank position before the top dead center of the piston 3.  The second reluctor 25a2 is provided at a position ahead of the reluctor 25a by a fixed angle (for example, 22.5 [deg]).  When the pickup 25b detects a forward end of and a rearward end of the reluctor 25a in a rotational direction R of the crankshaft 7, it outputs a rise pulse PS12 and a fall pulse P22,<br><br>
respectively.  When the pickup 25b detects a forward end of and a rearward end of the second reluctor 25a2, it outputs a rise pulse PSll and a fall pulse P21.<br>
Therefore, the angular velocity w that is an average angular velocity of the crankshaft 7 between the both pulses PS12, PS22 is calculated by the ECU 24 from the following equation.<br>
CD = e / t, where "t" is time between the both pulses PS12,PS22. [0024]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the average engine revolution number Ne can be captured as an average angular velocity at the time of one revolution of the crankshaft 7, and is calculated by the ECU 24 on the basis of the detection signal of the crank angle sensor 25.<br>
Moreover, the angular velocity Q of the crankshaft 7 is calculated by the ECU 24 on the basis of the.detection signal of the crank angle sensor 25.<br>
As results of these calculations, the amount Aoo of variation in the angular velocity which is required in order to estimate an air intake amount is also calculated by the ECU 24 on the basis of the average engine revolution number Ne and the angular velocity o of the crankshaft 7 which are calculated.  Concretely, the variation amount Aco is calculated from the following equation as a difference between the angular velocity o) and the average engine revolution number Ne at a specified crank position of the crankshaft 7 which is detected by the crank angular sensor<br><br>
25 .<br>
AGO = Ne — u [0025]<br>
Now, estimation (calculation) of the air intake amount on the basis of the variation amount Aco will be explained.<br>
Again referring to Fig. 2, the angular velocity u of the crankshaft 7 is varied in four respective strokes, including an intake stroke, a compression stroke, a combustion/expansion stroke and an exhaust stroke, which constitute one cycle of the internal combustion engine E. Concretely, in the intake stroke, pumping work such as intake resistance, etc. occurs, so that the angular velocity co is reduced.  In the compression stroke, compression resistance is generated due to a pressure rise in the combustion chamber 4, so that the angular velocity u of the crankshaft 7 is considerably reduced.  In the combustion/expansion stxoke, energy is generated by combustion and the pressure in the combustion chamber 4 rises, so that the angular velocity u is considerably increased.  In the exhaust stroke, the combustion is finished and, after the angular velocity co reaches a peak, frictional resistance and exhaust resistance of the exhaust gas by exhaust are generated, so that the angular velocity CO is reduced. [0026]<br>
Moreover, in a case where the average engine revolution number Ne (indicated by a chain double-dashed<br><br>
line in Fig. 2) is the same, the angular velocity CJ in case of a low intake air amount or a low torque is varied as indicated by a solid line in Fig. 2, and the angular velocity w in case of a high intake air amount or a high, torque is varied as indicated by a broken line in Fig. 2, so that the more the intake air amount is or the larger the torque which the internal combustion engine E produces is, the angular velocity u is considerably varied. [0027]<br>
Fig. 4 is a view illustrating a relationship between an absolute value of the variation amount of the angular velocity and the intake air, using the average engine revolution number as a parameter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in a case where the average engine revolution number Ne is constant, there is a linearly strong correlation between the variation amount Au of the angular velocity co and the intake air amount, so that it is possible to estimate the intake air amount per average engine revolution number Ne on the basis of the variation amount Acj.<br>
As described above, this variation amount Aoa can be detected utilizing the crank angle sensor 25 which is used in order to calculate the average engine revolution number Ne, etc., thus making it possible to estimate (calculate) the intake air amount without using an air flow meter or an intake pressure sensor. [0028]<br>
In this case, the variation amount Aco at the<br><br>
specified crank position of the crankshaft 7 that is detected by the variation amount detecting section 32 depends upon a position of the reluctor 25a of the crank angle sensor 25, or the crank position before the top dead center of the piston 3 in this embodiment, and is considered to be the variation amount Au of the angular velocity co in the compression stroke that is a specified stroke of the four strokes including the intake stroke, the compression stroke, the combustion/expansion stroke, and the exhaust stroke.<br>
The variation amount detecting section 32 detects the variation amount Aw before the compression top dead center in this way, whereby the variation amount Aw at the crank position at which the variation amount Aw is large compared with another crank position is detected, so that it is possible to detect a more precise variation amount Au. Incidentally, regarding the angular velocity w which is calculated on the basis of the crank angle sensor 25, it at the compression top dead center is lower than it at the exhaust top dead center, so that the angular velocity w before the compression top dead center is specified. [0029]<br>
Next, the calculation timing of the average engine revolution number Ne and the calculation timing of the angular velocity w of the crankshaft 7 are discussed.<br>
In a case where the variation in the engine revolution number is small, an actual engine revolution number and a detected average engine revolution number are<br><br>
considered to be substantially the same, so that it is not necessary to so strictly consider the calculation timing of the average engine revolution number Ne and the calculation timing of the angular velocity GJ of the crankshaft 7, each calculation timing can be performed in separate strokes, and it is also possible to reduce a calculation load involved in parallel processing. [0030]<br>
However, in a case where the engine condition considerably changes as at the time of sudden acceleration or sudden deceleration, the variation of the average engine revolution number Ne is also increased.  A manner to allow the calculation timing of the average engine revolution number Ne and the calculation timing of the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 to be different from each other is unfavorable from the viewpoint of obtaining the precise variation amount Aco.<br>
This is the reason why mismatching between the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 and the average engine revolution number Ne occurs in a case where the calculation of the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 and the calculation of the average engine revolution number Ne are carried out in different stokes, thus causing the air intake amount to be different from an air intake amount which is actually required.<br>
Concretely, in a case where the actual engine revolution number at the time of the detection of the angular velocity GO of the crankshaft 7 is considerably<br><br>
increased relative to the average engine revolution number Ne at the time of the detection, this case becomes equivalent to a case where the engine revolution number is detected as a seemingly smaller value.<br>
Consequently, the value /\Q   takes a negative value as represented by the following equation.<br>
Aco = Ne - o 
Therefore, the air intake amount which is estimated (calculated) becomes less than the air intake amount which is actually required.  Therefore, the ignition timing is set to a timing earlier than a suitable ignition timing.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the actual engine revolution number at the time of the detection of the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 is considerably reduced relative to the average engine revolution number Ne at the time of the detection, this case becomes equivalent to a case where the engine revolution number is detected as a seemingly larger value.<br>
Consequently, the value Aco (= Ne - u) becomes larger than a correct value and the air intake amount which is estimated (calculated) becomes more than the air intake amount which is actually required.  Therefore, the ignition timing is set to a timing later than the suitable ignition timing.<br>
Therefore, in either case, the air intake amount which is estimated becomes different from the air intake amount which is actually required and the ignition timing is also shifted from the suitable timing.<br><br>
[0031]<br>
Therefore, to simultaneously carry out the calculation of the angular velocity to of the crankshaft 7 during the period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated in a stroke prior to a compression stroke in which the ignition is to be performed becomes preferable.<br>
By performing these calculations at the same time, the engine conditions at the time of the respective calculations can be considered to be the same and it is possible to calculate a more ideal air intake amount.<br>
More favorably, if the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 is simultaneously performed during the period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated in the compression stroke just prior to the stroke in which the ignition is to be performed, it is possible to carry out the calculations in an engine condition which is close Lu a more actual ignition timing. [0032]<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, the calculation of the angular velocity ω of the crankshaft 7 is simultaneously performed during the period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated in the compression stroke just prior to the stroke in which the ignition is to be performed.  Therefore, according to this embodiment, differently from the case where the calculation of the average engine revolution number Ne and the calculation of the angular velocity co of the crankshaft 7 are performed in<br><br>
the separate stokes, the conditions of the engine at the time of the calculation of the average engine revolution number Ne and at the time of the calculation of the crank angular velocity ω are considered to be the same and, even if the variation in the engine revolution number is large, its influence is reduced and to more correctly detect the variation amount Au becomes possible, thus making it possible to appropriately calculate the air intake amount and set the suitable ignition timing.<br>
In this way, the revolution number detecting section 31 and the variation amount detecting section 32 which are a part of the engine condition detecting section, a warm-up condition detecting section 33 discussed in detail hereinafter, and the trouble detecting section 34 are respectively realized as functions of the ECU 24. [0033]<br>
Meanwhile, referring to Figs. 1 and 4, the O2 sensor 27 has a detection element 27a formed of a zirconia-based solid electrolyte substrate and outputs, in an on/off manner, a rich signal in a case where the air-fuel ratio is smaller than a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio and a lean signal in a case where the air-fuel ratio is larger than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, these detection signals SO being inputted into the ECU 24. [0034]<br>
When the detection element 27a is in a low thermal state, the O2 sensor 27 is in a non-active state, does not<br><br>
generate a detection signal SO correctly reflecting oxygen concentration, and does not normally operate.   Therefore, the amount Q of fuel jetted from the fuel injection nozzle 20 is controlled on the basis of the detection signal SO outputted in an active state where the detection element 27a becomes more than a predetermined temperature.  In the O2 sensor 27, a heater for heating the detection element 27a and reducing a period of time to reach the active state of the detection element is not provided and, correspondingly, cost is reduced.<br>
Moreover, the O2 sensor (oxygen concentration sensor) may be an LAF sensor which linearly detects the oxygen concentration (namely, the air-fuel ratio) in the exhaust gas.  In this case, a target air-fuel ratio is set to a lean air-fuel ratio, thus making it possible to improve fuel economy. [0035]<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph indicating a change in the detection signal of the O2 sensor after operation start from a state before the completion of warming-up.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, when the O2 sensor 27 is at a non-active state at the time of a cold state of the internal combustion engine E, namely, at the time of an operation state before the completion of warming-up, etc., the fluctuation of the rich signal and the lean signal is small and a correct air-fuel ratio can not be detected.  As the warming-up of the internal combustion engine -E progresses and the temperature of the detection element 27a rises, the<br><br>
fluctuation between the rich signal and the lean signal becomes large.  At the time of the completion of the warming-up of the internal combustion engine E, the detection element 27a reaches the predetermined temperature and produces an output in which the rich signal and the lean signal, each precisely reflecting the air-fuel ratio, become substantially given values.  Thus, the ECU 24 functions as the warming-up condition detecting section 33 and can detect the warming-up condition of the internal combustion engine E by utilizing the detection signal SO which the O2 sensor 27 outputs. [0036]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the ECU 24 functions as the trouble detecting section 34 and detects the breakdown or abnormality of the throttle valve angle sensor 26 or the O2 sensor 27 on the basis of a detection signal St of the throttle valve angle sensor 26 and the detection signal SO of the O2 sensor 27. [0037]<br>
According to the opening a, the average engine revolution number Ne, the detection signal SO representative of the air-fuel ratio, the warming-up condition of the internal combustion engine E, the variation amount AQ, and the abnormality and normality of each of the throttle valve angle sensor 26 and the 02 sensor 27, which are respectively detected by the throttle valve angle sensor 26, the revolution number detecting section 31, the O2 sensor 27, the variation amount<br><br>
detecting section 32, the warming-up condition detecting section 33, and the trouble detecting section 34, the air-fuel ratio controlling section 40 sets the amount Q of fuel (for example, fuel injection time) injected into the intake air from the fuel injection nozzle 20. [0038]<br>
Control maps which are to be used for the setting of the fuel amount Q are memorized in the storage device 24a. The control maps includes a basic amount map Mb in which a basic amount Qb of the fuel amount Q is set utilizing the opening a and the average engine revolution number Ne as variables, a map MO for correction in which a correction factor or correction amount for correcting the basic amount Qb is set utilizing the detection signal SO of the O2 sensor as a variable, a special time-fuel amount map Ms in which a special time-fuel amount Qs is set utilizing the variation amount Au and the average engine revolution number Ne ay variables, and an ignition map Mi, an exhaust reflux map Me and a valve map Mv which will be discussed hereinafter. [0039]<br>
Fig. 6 is an operation flowchart of the embodiment.<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 6, the control of the fuel amount Q which is performed by the air-fuel ratio controlling section 40 per predetermined time is explained.<br>
First of all, the ECU 24 judges, on the basis of the detection signal Sa of the trouble detecting section 34 (refer to Fig. 1), as to whether or not the throttle valve<br><br>
angle sensor 26 or the 02 sensor 27 is abnormal (step SI).<br>
When the abnormalities of the throttle valve angle sensor 26 and the O2 sensor 27 are not detected by the trouble detecting section 34 on the basis of judgments in the step SI and step S2 and the O2 sensor 27 is at the active state, the internal combustion engine E is operated in a normal engine state.  At the time of this normal operation, processings in steps S3 and step S4 are performed and, on the basis of the rich signal and the lean signal which are the detection signals SO from the O2 sensor 27 in the active state, the air-fuel ratio controlling section 40 performs, as a normal time-control, a feed back control for controlling the air-fuel ratio in such a manner that an air-fuel mixture of a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio being a target air-fuel ratio is formed. [0040]<br>
On the other hand, when the throttle valve angle sensor 2 6 or the O2 sensor 27 is detected as being abnormal on the basis of the detection signal Sa of the trouble detecting section 34 in the judgment of the step 1 (step SI; "Yes") or when the O2 sensor 27 is detected as being not in the active state on the basis of a detection signal Sw of the warming-up condition detecting section 33 in the judgment of the step S2 and the internal combustion engine E is therefore in the state prior to the completion of the warming-up of the internal combustion engine E (step S2; 'No") , the internal combustion engine E is operated in a special engine state.<br><br>
[0041]<br>
At the time of this special operation, the ECU 24 calculates the variation amount Aw on the basis of the angular velocity ω calculated by the variation amount detecting section 32 in the compression stroke (compression stroke PI; refer to Fig. 3) just prior to the stroke in which the ignition is to be performed (compression stroke PO; refer to Fig. 3), and the average engine revolution number Ne simultaneously calculated by the revolution number detecting section 31, the special time-fuel map Ms is retrieved and the special time-fuel amount Qs corresponding to the variation amount Au and the average engine revolution number Ne is set (step S6).  A drive signal instructing the injection of the fuel amount Q considering the special time-fuel amount Qs as the fuel amount Q is outputted to the fuel injection nozzle 20 (step 5) which performs the special-time control (open-loop control) in which the fuel injection nozzle 20 injects fuel of the fuel amount Q into the intake air.  Incidentally, in this special time-control, corrections such as a correction based on the engine temperature and a correction at the time of starting, accelerating or decelerating may be made as corrections with respect to the special time fuel amount Qs. [0042]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, on the basis of the crank position detected by the crank angle sensor 25, the ignition control section 41 controls the ignition timing,<br><br>
based on the ignition map Mi in which the ignition timing is determined utilizing the variation amount hw   and the average engine revolution number Ne as variables.  The exhaust gas reflux control section 42 controls the reflux controlling valve 22a, based on the exhaust reflux map Me in which the opening of the reflux controlling valve 22a is set utilizing the variation amount Aw and the average engine revolution number Ne as variables, and controls the amount of the reflux of the exhaust gas.  Moreover, the valve controlling section 43 controls an actuator of the valve characteristic variable mechanism 23a, based on the valve map MV in which an operation position of the actuator of the valve characteristic variable mechanism is set by-causing the variation amount Au and the average engine revolution number Ne to correspond to a valve lift amount or an opening/closing timing, as variables.<br>
Thereby, without the provision of an air flow sensor and an intake pressure sensor to the internal combustion engine E, the operation control of the internal combustion engine E is performed on the basis of the ignition timing corresponding to the intake air amount, the exhaust gas reflux amount and the valve operation characteristic, and it is possible to perform a high accurate air-fuel ratio control according to the intake air amount and contribute to improvements in emission performance and fuel economy.<br>
While the case where the air-fuel ratio sensor is provided has been described above, the present invention may be also applied to, a case where the air-fuel ratio<br><br>
sensor is not employed. [0043]<br>
[2] SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
The second embodiment is an embodiment which relates to the setting of the calculation period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated.  In the second embodiment, the structure of the system shall be referred to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 7 is a detailed explanatory view illustrating relationships between the respective strokes of the internal combustion engine, and the reluctor, the pulse and the angular velocity of the crankshaft in the second embodiment.<br>
In the meanwhile, actually, the variation amount of the average engine revolution number Ne is not constant at the time of sudden acceleration or sudden deceleration. For example, in the compression stroke at the time of the sudden acceleration, when iynlLion is performed at an ignition timing set just prior to the compression top dead center, energy is produced due to combustion, pressure in the combustion chamber 4 is increased, and the engine revolution number is considerably varied.  This considerable change of the engine revolution number appears just after the ignition as shown in Fig. 7 and, thereafter, is gradually made (increase in Fig. 7). [0044]<br>
Therefore, in the second embodiment, to calculate the variation amount AGO inclusive of a sudden increase in the<br><br>
engine revolution number, a period which includes at least a period of time to calculate the angular velocity oj and a period between the ignition timing and the compression top dead center is targeted for the detection of the average engine revolution number Ne.<br>
The calculation of the angular velocity co is simultaneously performed within the period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated.  In a case where a period in which the crankshaft, namely, the reluctor 25a makes one revolution is set to the period of time to calculate the average engine revolution number Ne, the following three periods can be regarded as a period which includes a period between a rising timing of the rise pulse PS12 due to passage of the reluctor 25a and the compression top dead center and in which the crankshaft makes one revolution. [0045]<br>
(1)	a period between a rising Liming of a rise pulse PSll in the compression stroke and a rising time of the rise pulse PSll in the exhaust stroke;<br>
(2)	a period between a falling timing of a fall pulse PS21 in the compression stroke and a falling timing of the fall pulse PS21 in the exhaust stroke; and<br>
(3)	a period between a rising timing of the rise pulse PS12 in the compression stroke and a rising time of the rise pulse PS12 in the exhaust stroke.<br>
Of these periods, a period more suitable for the control is the period (3) in which most new average engine<br><br>
revolution number Ne can be obtained after variation in the revolution speed of the crankshaft 7, namely, variation in the average engine revolution number Ne occurs.  However, actually, the period (1) or the period (2) may be employed.<br>
[0046]<br>
Moreover, in a case where there is no problem of a period shorter than the period in which the crankshaft makes one revolution, it is possible to employ a suitable combination of periods comprising a rising timing or falling timing of a pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2, and a rising timing or falling timing of a pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a, as the period in which the average engine revolution number Ne is calculated.  In this case, it is also desirable that the detection period is selected in such a manner that the average engine revolution number Ne calculated is brought into a state where become more close to an engine revolution number at the iynlLlon timing which is the calculation target.<br>
[0047]<br>
[3] THIRD EMBODIMENT<br>
The third embodiment is an embodiment in which the detection of the angular velocity is performed with more precision by considering an error (for example, mass-production tolerance) in a circumferential length of the reluctor (reluctor width) and detecting the angular velocity, and the operation control is performed.  In the third embodiment, the structure of the system shall be<br><br>
referred to Fig. 1 and the relationships between the respective strokes of the internal combustion engine, and the reluctor, the pulse and the angular velocity of the crankshaft shall be referred to Fig. 7.<br>
In the past, in a case where the angular velocity of the crankshaft is detected utilizing the reluctor and the pickup, the angular velocity, etc. are calculated by using a predetermined fixed-value as a reluctor electrical-angle corresponding to a detected pulse width. [0048]<br>
In the meanwhile, in a case where the forward and rearward ends of the same reluctor are detected by the same pickup, unless a change with the passage of time is considered, a reluctor electrical-angle that is a rotation angle of the flywheel between the rise pulse and the fall pulse that are detected is typically constant.  However, there is a possibility that, in the light of control, the reluctor electrical-angle to be detected by the reluctor and the pickup that are actually carried on the vehicle will not be always equal to a predetermined, reluctor electrical-angle due to an error in the reluctor or the pickup (mass-production tolerance such as dimensional error and detection error) .  This means that there is room for improving detection accuracy in a loading condition of the internal combustion engine.<br>
Thus, the object of the third embodiment is to decrease the influence of the error such as the tolerance at the time of mass-prorinc-i na the reluctor or the pickup,<br><br>
to improve the detection accuracy in the loading condition of the internal combustion engine and to control the operation. [0049]<br>
Prior to making of a concrete description, first of all, the mounting positions of the reluctors are concretely explained.<br>
Fig. 8 is an explanatory view of an embodiment of the mounting positions of the reluctor and the second reluctor.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the reluctor 25a and the second reluctor 25a2 are mounted so that the forward end of the second reluctor 25a2 is mounted to a position situated forward by 8.25 [deg] from a position corresponding to the top dead center position of the piston 3 in the flywheel 8 and the rearward end of the reluctor 25a is mounted to a position situated forward by 15 [deg] from the position corresponding to the top dead center position of the piston 3.  Moreover, a predetermined crank angle G corresponding to the reluctor width is equal to 4 5 [deg] and the forward end of the reluctor 25a is situated forward by 60 [deg] from the position corresponding to the top dead center position of the piston 3.<br>
Consequently, the forward end of the second reluctor 25a2 is arranged at a position forward spaced apart by a predetermined angle =22.5 [deg] with respect to the forward end of the reluctor 25a. [0050]<br>
Next, the principle of the third embodiment will be<br><br>
explained.<br>
Fig. 9 is an explanatory view of the principle of the third embodiment.<br>
Under the condition that the angular velocity number of the crankshaft is regarded as a linear function (linearly changes), for example, the continuous exhaust stroke and intake stroke (= the rotation angle of the crankshaft that corresponds to 360 [deg] ) , the angular velocity can be considered to linearly vary (increase or decrease).<br>
Therefore, if the change of the angular velocity in a period in which the angular velocity can be considered to linearly vary is approximated by a straight line of the linear function, and the rotation angle of the crankshaft, at the time of detection of the passage of the reluctor (period), which is time integration of the angular velocity in the detection period of the reluctor and the rotation angle of the crankshaft, in a pexiod of non-detection of the reluctor, which is time integration of the angular velocity at the time of non-detection of the passage of the reluctor (period) can be calculated, the rotation angle of the crankshaft in the detection period of the reluctor, namely, an actual reluctor electrical-angle T3 of can be calculated. [0051]<br>
That is, based on the angular velocity cox at the time of detecting the reluctor and the angular velocity uy at the time of non-detecting the reluctor, as shown in Fig. 8,<br><br>
the reluctor electrical-angle T3 which corresponds to the reluctor width of the reluctor is calculated by geometrical calculation and divided by passage detection time Tx, whereby a more accurate angular-velocity w can be calculated.<br>
In the third embodiment, a reluctor angle Dx is found based on the angular velocity «x at the time of detecting the passage of the reluctor and the passage detection time Tx, an angle Dy other than the reluctor angle Dx is found based on the angular velocity oy at the time of non-detecting the passage of the reluctor and the passage non-detection time Ty, and the reluctor electrical-angle T3 is calculated by the following equation.<br><br>
[0052]<br>
Next, the process of calculating the actual electrical-angle of the reluctor will be explained in detail.  In the following explanation, the reluctor 25a and the second reluctor 25a2 are provided on the flywheel 8 in such manner that a rise timing of a pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2 is set to a position ahead by 22.5 [deg] as the rotation angle of the crankshaft with respect to a rise timing of a pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a.  That is, Dl + D2 = 22.5 [deg] shall be given.  Incidentally, this angle is suitably set and, if its value is previously seen, it is not limited to 22 . 5 [deg] . [0053]<br><br>
More particularly, as shown in Fig. 8, in a case where the angular velocity decreases as a primary straight line in the exhaust stroke and the intake stroke, an angular velocity uA (in this embodiment, an average angular velocity in the engine) is considered to be typical of the angular velocity of the crankshaft between the rise timing of the pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2 and the rise timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a in the exhaust stroke, and an angular velocity toB is considered to be typical of the angular velocity of the crankshaft between the rise timing of the pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2 and the rise timing of pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a in the next compression stroke occurring via the intake stroke succeeding the exhaust stroke, these angular velocities QA and «B are calculated. [0054]<br>
That is, time TA which corresponds Lo a period between the previous rise timing of the pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2 and the succeeding rise timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a is detected, whereby the average angular velocity uA in this period is detected by the following equation.<br>
Similarly, time TB which corresponds to a period between the recent rise timing of the pulse PSAl corresponding to the second reluctor 25a2 and the rise timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a<br><br>
is detected, whereby the average angular velocity coB in this period is detected by the following equation.<br>
Moreover, the reluctor angle Dx which is the rotation angle of the crankshaft in a period, in which the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a in the exhaust stroke is in the "H" level, namely, the reluctor passage detection period, is expressed by the following equation by which the area of a trapezoid is calculated. [0055]<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
[0056] <br>
In the equation, the passage detection time Tx is time elapsing between the rise-up of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a and the fall-down of the pulse PSA2, and<br><br>
[0057J<br>
On the other hand, the rotation angle Dy of the crankshaft in a period, in which the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a in the exhaust stroke falls down and again rises up in the next compression stroke, namely, in the reluctor non-detection period, is expressed by the following equation by which the area of the trapezoid is calculated.<br>
[0058]<br>
[Equation 2] <br><br>
[0059]<br>
In the equation, the passage non-detection time Ty is time elapsing between the fall-down of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the second reluctor and the rise-up of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the second reluctor in the next compression stroke, and<br><br>
[0060]<br>
Moreover, the sum of the passage detection time Tx and the passage non-detection time Ty is equivalent to time during which the cran]
Next, the angular velocity wl at the rise timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the second reluctor in the exhaust stroke, the angular velocity uc at the fall timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the second reluctor in the exhaust stroke, and the angular velocity uO at the fall timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the second reluctor in the next compression stroke are calculated by arithmetic operation. [0061]<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
[0062] <br>
In the equation, Dl is the rotation angle of the crankshaft which corresponds to a period in which the pulse PSAl is in the "H" level, and D2 is the rotation angle of the crankshaft which corresponds to a period in which the<br><br>
pulse   PSAl   is   in  the   ^^L"   level    (hereinafter,   similarly referred   to). [0063]<br>
[Equation   4] <br>
[0064]<br>
[Equation 5]<br>
[0065] <br>
Consequently, the rotation angle of the crankshaft in the period of detecting the passage of the reluctor, namely, the reluctor electrical-angle T3 is expressed by the following equation. [0066]<br>
[Equation 6]<br><br>
[0067]<br>
Therefore, by using the calculated electrical-angle T3 of the reluctor, an error in the reluctor detection period due to the mass-production tolerance, etc. is absorbed and the reluctor detection period by the reluctor mounted on each vehicle can be precisely grasped.<br>
Next, a summary process in a case where the rotation angle of the crankshaft which corresponds to the reluctor detection period is detected and used in an actual vehicle<br><br>
will be explained.<br>
When a staring operation of an engine is performed by a starter (cell motor or kick), the ECU 24 detects the fall timing of the pulse PSA2 corresponding to the reluctor 25a at a suitable timing, sets an ignition timing based on the detected timing, and starts the engine. [0068]<br>
After the engine starting, the ECU 24 calculates the above-mentioned angular velocities coA, uB based on a pulse signal outputted by the pickup 25b.<br>
Simultaneously with this, the ECU 24 detects the time Ta, the passage detection time Tx, the passage non-detection time Ty, and the time Tb.<br>
Then, the reluctor electrical-angle T3 is calculated based on the above-mentioned equations and the calculated reluctor electrical-angle T3 is stored in a volatile memory such as RAM.  Thereafter, the loading condition of the engine is detected based on Llie reluctor electrical-angle T3 and the operation control is performed according to the loading condition. [0069]<br>
As explained above, according to the third embodiment, the reluctor electrical-angle T3 is detected at the time of the engine starting and, thereafter, the operation control is performed on the basis of the detected reluctor electrical-angle T3, so that the influence of the error due to the tolerance at the time of mass-producing the reluctor or pickup is decreased, the loading condition of the<br><br>
internal combustion engine is precisely grasped, and the operation control can be then performed.<br>
While the starting of the engine is performed without using the reluctor electrical-angle T3 at the time of the engine starting in the above embodiment, the starting may be performed using a previously set fixed-value for the reluctor electrical-angle and, after the calculation of the reluctor electrical-angle T3, the control may be performed using the calculated value. [0070]<br>
The operation controlling system for the internal combustion engine, according to the present invention, is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments and, of course, various structures can be employed without departing from the gist of the present invention.<br>
Moreover, while the variation amount AGO of the angular velocity ω of the crankshaft 7 is based on the detection value obtained by directly detecting the angular velocity GO of the crankshaft 7 via the flywheel 8 coupled to the crankshaft 7 in the above embodiment, it may be based on a detection value obtained by indirectly detecting the angular velocity GO of the crankshaft 7 by detection of the angular velocity ω  of a rotating shaft (for example, a cam shaft of the valve train device 23 or drive axes of accessories of the internal combustion engine E) rotating in synchronism with the crankshaft 7.<br>
Moreover, the variation amount Ω may be a variation amount in the strokes other than the compression stroke in<br><br>
the one cycle.<br>
Moreover, the internal combustion engine E may be carried on a machine other than the vehicle. [Brief Description of the Drawings] [0071]<br>

a control section calculating, from detection results by the rotation-detecting means, an average revolution number in a predetermined period and a partial crank angular velocity of the crankshaft that corresponds to a reluctor width, and determining a load of the internal combustion engine on the basis of these calculation results,<br>
wherein the control section calculates a reluctor electrical-angle T3 corresponding to the reluctor width, on the basis of an angular velocity x at the time of detection of passage of the reluctor and an angular velocity toy at the time of non detection of the passage of the reluctor, and calculates the crank angular velocity ω by dividing the reluctor electrical-angle T3 by a passage detection time Tx. [Claim 4]<br>
The operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, according to Claim 3,<br>
wherein the control section determines a reluctor angle Dx on the basis of the angular velocity ωx at the time of the passage detection and the passage detection time Tx, determines an angle Dy other than the reluctor<br><br>
angle Dx on the basis of the angular velocity coy at the time of the passage non-detection and a passage non-detection time Ty, and calculates the reluctor electrical-angle T3 by an equation (1).<br>
T3 = {Dx / (Dx + Dy) } x 360 [deg]     •• (1) [Claim 5]<br>
The operation controlling system for an internal combustion engine, according to Claim 4,<br>
wherein: a second reluctor is provided at a position ahead of the reluctor by a predetermined angle; and<br>
the control section calculates, from the detection results by the rotation-detecting means, an angular velocity ωA in a period between a previous detection-starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and a succeeding detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, and an angular velocity ωB in a period between a recent detection-starting timing of the passage of the second reluctor and a succeeding detect ion-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, calculates an angular velocity cal at a previous detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, an angular velocity ωo at a previous detection-finishing timing of the passage of the reluctor and an angular velocity ω0 at the recent detection-starting timing of the passage of the reluctor, on the basis of the angular velocities ΩA and ωB, and calculates the reluctor angle Dx and the angle Dy by equations (2)-(5) on the basis of the passage detection time Tx and the passage non-detection time Ty.<br><br><br><br><br></td>
