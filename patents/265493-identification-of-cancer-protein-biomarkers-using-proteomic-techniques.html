IDENTIFICATION OF CANCER PROTEIN BIOMARKERS USING P3ROTEOMIC TECHNIQUES<br>
CROSS-REFERJENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.60/545,581, filed February 19,2004, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/545,900, filed February 20, 2004. The teachings of both referenced applications are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FUNDING<br>
.This invention was made with government support under grant number DE-FG02-ER63462 awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States and the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death. EOC is characterized by few early symptoms, presentation at an advanced stage, and poor survival. This year approximately 25,000 women will be newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 13,500 will die from the disease. The major limitations in the treatment of ovarian cancer are: i) the lack of an early detection tumor marker, ii) the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and iii) the lack of obvious early warning symptoms. The high mortality rate is related to the inability to detect early disease, as approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. In patients diagnosed with early (stage I or II) disease, the five-year survival rate ranges from 60 to 90% depending on the degree of tumor differentiation. Although the clinical presentation of heritable cancer is similar to the high-risk population, the onset of ovarian cancer in this group tends to occur 10-15 years earlier than that of the general population (early 40's rather than 60's). One of the most promising approaches to management of EOC is early detection. The most commonly used test, CA125 identifies a group of cell surface glycoproteins that have uncertain biological behavior and very limited clinical application for the detection of early stage disease. As a single marker, CA125 has apredictive value of less than 10% in Stage I. Even the addition of ultrasound screening to CA125 measurement improves the positive prediction value to<br>

WO 2005/083440	PCT/US2005/001832<br>
only about 20%. The lack of specific markers for ovarian cancer makes it difficult to achieve the clinical objective of screening and early detection.<br>
Presently there is no commercially available test that can be used to diagnose either early or advanced stage ovarian cancer. Thus, the identification of a test that can be used to diagnose early or advance stage ovarian cancer is required.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
/.	Overview<br>
Described herein is a method which can be used to discriminate between cancer subjects (including subjects diagnosed with early stage (stage I-II) disease) and healthy subjects. This method is based on the identification ofbidmarkers which are particularly well suited to discriminate between-cancer subjects and healthy subjects. These biomarkers were identified using a unique and novel screening method described herein involving several different screening steps using samples from different subjects in each step and validation with different techniques. The biomarkers disclosed herein can be used in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of cancer.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the invention disclosed herein refers to a new test based on four biomarkers: leptin, prolactin, OKN and IGF II, which discriminate between cancer subjects and healthy subjects, particularly between ovarian cancer subjects and healthy subjects. In one embodiment, these four biomarkers can be used in a blood test for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer.<br>
These biomarkers identified herein can be used in combination with additional known biomarkers. For example, a known biomarker of ovarian cancer is CA125. The use of CA125 in conjunction with the biomarkers identified herein presents a novel approach for the early detection of ovarian cancer and may significantly improve our ability to accurately detect pre-malignant change or early stage ovarian cancer in' asymptomatic women at increased risk for the development of ovarian cancer. Further, the biomarkers identified in this application can be used in conjunction with other diagnostic techniques, For example, for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, the biomarkers identified in this application can be used in conjunction with vaginal examination, ultrasound or MRI to diagnose ovarian cancer.<br>

WO 2005/083440	PCT/US2005/001832<br>
ovarian cancer and healthy subjects. As shown in Figure l,duringPhaseIofthe screening method, the levels of expression of 169 proteins were measured in 46 serum samples (18 samples were obtained from subjects with ovarian cancer and 28 samples were obtained from healthy, age-matched controls) via RCA immunoassay microarray in order to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in subjects with ovarian cancer and in healthy subjects.<br>

From this group of 169 proteins, 35 proteins were identified which were differentially expressed between healthy subjects and subjects with ovarian cancer (p-5 values less than 0.05 based on analysis of -variance tests (ANOVA)) . This data is identified in Table 2.<br>

These 35 proteins were selected for further characterization with 40 serum samples obtained from subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. From this group of 35 proteins, ten (10) biomarkers exhibited the greatest differences in protein expression between subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer and healthy subjects. These 10 biomarkers are identified in Table 3.<br>

Of these 10 proteins, some of the proteins that showed the most potential for differentiating between not only healthy subjects and subjects newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, but also between healthy subjects and subjects with recurrent disease, were assayed using sandwich Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) on a small cohort of 50 subjects (25 cancer subjects with Stage III/IV ovarian cancer and having an average age of 63.4 years and 25 healthy subjects having an average age of 57 years). Based on ELISA testing of the original sample set, EGF, TNFa, and IL-17 did not provide consistent differentiation between the cancer and control serum samples. MIF-1 was a promising marker but ELISA kits were not reliably available to continue testing. As shown in Figure 3, four proteins showed perfect correlation between the RCA microarray immunoassays and the ELISA assays. The average<br>

As determined experimentally above using a specific ELISA test, the predetermined standard of leptin is 7-50 ng/ml; the predetermined standard of prolactin is 0-10 pg/ml; the predetermined standard of OPN is 0.5-19 pg/ml; and the predetermined standard of IGF-II is 450-2500 ng/ml. A person of skill in the art would understand that the predetermined standard concentration of a biomarker may vary from assay to assay depending on various factors.<br>
A final panel of four biomarkers (leptin, prolactin, OPN and IGF-II) were selected for assay in a blind study consisting of 206 serum samples which included samples from 106 healthy subjects and 100 ovarian cancer subjects Stages I-IV. The characteristics of the subjects used in this blind study are described in Table 5. The expression of these four biomarkers was determined by ELISA.<br>

To differentiate between subjects with ovarian cancer and healthy subjects, statistical cluster analysis was performed. Although none of the four markers could reliably separate the normal and cancer groups using the least squares fit in a traditional<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2005/083440	PCT/US2005/001832<br>
binary data set analysis (Figure 4), pair plots of the four markers showed better separation between subjects these groups (Figure 5).<br>
The combined data for the four biomarkers was analyzed by four different classifiers: support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-NN), classification trees, and a score-based classification system to classify samples from healthy subjects and samples from subjects with ovarian cancer. Support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-NN), classification trees are hierarchical clustering models.<br>
Figure 6 shows the result of the score based classification system. Particularly, Figure 6 shows the scores assigned to the 206 subjects who participated in the phase of the screening assay. The scores were assigned using the following method: For each marker, the best split point to minimize the number of misclassified subjects was found. The split point divides the sample space into two intervals: one for healthy and another for cancer. A score 0 is assigned to a subject if its related observation falls in the normal interval; otherwise, a score 1 is assigned. Table 6 shows the split point for each of the four biomarkers described above. Overall, an individual is assigned a score as the sum of these assigned scores from 4 different markers. Thus, in this instance the range of such score is [0,4]. Figure 6 illustrates that subjects having a score greater than or equal to 2 are likely to have cancer; and subjects with a score less than or equal to 1 are likely to be healthy.<br>

Table 7 gives classification results based on 10-fold cross-validation for all four classification methods considered. The results indicated that all the classification methods can well distinguish normal and cancer groups. The proposed score based classification method performed better than the nearest neighbor and classification tree methods. The results from the scoring method are comparable to those of SVM. The sensitivity of the test is 96%, specificity 97%, PPV 97% and NPV 96%. The<br>

"sensitivity" of an assay refers to the probability that the test will yield a positive result in an individual afflicted with ovarian cancer. The "specificity" of an assay refers to the probability that the test will yield a negative result in an individual not afflicted with ovarian cancer. The "positive predictive value" (PPV) of an assay is the ratio of true positive results (i.e. positive assay results for patients afflicted with ovarian cancer) to all positive results (i.e. positive assay results for patients afflicted with ovarian cancer -^positive assay results for patients not afflicted with ovarian cancer).<br>

Finally, an additional validation blind study was performed on forty (40) samples using the score-based classification system discussed above. This method was able to accurately classify 38 out of the 40 subjects as having ovarian cancer or not (one sample was classified as a false positive and another sample was classified as a false negative).<br>

Materials and Methods Used in Example 1<br>
Microarray Manufacture: Microarrays were prepared according to Schweitzer et al, Nat Biotech (2002) 20:359. In shoit, glass slides were cleaned and derivatized with 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane. The slides were equipped with a Teflon mask, which divided the slide into sixteen 0.65 cm diameter wells or circular analysis sites called subarrays (Figure 2). Printing was performed with a Perkin-EImer SpotArray Enterprise non-contact arrayer equipped with piezoelectric tips, which dispense a droplet (~350 pL) for each microarray spot. Antibodies were applied at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at defined positions. Each chip was printed with sixteen copies of one type of array, either array 1,2,3,4, 5 or 6. (See Table 1.) A set of antibodies was printed with quadruplicate spots in each subarray. After printing, chips were inspected using light microscopy. If the percentage of missing spots observed was greater than 5%, then the batch failed and the slides were discarded immediately. For all print runs described herein, 100% of the antibody features and &gt;95% of the biotin calibrators were printed. Microarray chips were validated in concert with a set of qualified reagents in two ways. First, mixtures of 1-3 different cytokines were prepared so as to provide a high intensity signal and applied to 14 wells on a chip (each well treated with<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2005/083440	PCT/US 2005/001832<br>
a different mixture up to the total complement of detector antibodies) and two arrays were used as blank controls. The chips were developed and scanned and the resulting signals were compared to the positional map of the particular array. Second, a titration QC for all analytes of a specified array using known sample matrices was performed. Normal human serum and heparinized plasma were assayed neat or spiked with purified recombinant cytokines representing all analytes in the array. Spiked mixtures were then titrated down the subarrays of a slide from 9,000 pg/mL to 37 pg/mL of spiked cytokine concentrations along with two subarrays for each un-spiked control sample. The data was quantified and for every analyte in the array a titration curve was generated to examine feature intensity behavior as a function of concentration. Taken together, this data was used to confirm the activity of array features and reagent sets.<br>
RCA Microarrray Immunoassay: Prior to assay, the slides were removed from storage at room temperature in sealtjd containers and opened in a humidity controlled chamber (45-55%). Slides were blocked with Seablock (Pierce Chemical Co.), diluted 1:1 with PBS for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Following removal of the blocking solution, they were washed twice with lxPBS/0.5% Brij 35 prior to application of sample. Four controls were included on each sample slide with feature concentrations corresponding to four anchor points on the full titration curve. The test samples were assayed on the remaining 12 subarrays. Twenty µl of the treated sample were then applied to each subarray. The basics of performing immunoassays with RCA signal amplification has been described (Schweitzer et al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2002) 20:359-65) and we are using SOPs derived from the protocols used in that study. Slides were scanned using a LS200 scanner (TECAN). Scanned images were analyzed using proprietary software. The fluorescence intensity of microarray spots was analyzed for each feature and sample, and the resulting mean intensity values were determined. Dose-response curves for selected cytokines were examined, ensuring that feature intensity is above background and exhibiting increasing intensity with increasing analyte concentration.<br>
Subject Population for RCA microarray immunoassay: For the RCA microarray immunoassays the serum from 86 subjects was assayed. Of the 86 subjects, 28 were healthy and had an average age of 60.8 years, 58 had Stage IU/IV ovarian cancer and had an average age of 57.1. Of the 58 patients with Stage m/IV ovarian<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2005/083440	PCT/US2005/001832<br>
cancer, 18 were newly diagnosed and the remaining 40 were subjects with recurrent disease.<br>
Subject Population for Blind Study (EUSA): For the panel of ELISA, serum samples were collected from 100 subjects with ovarian cancer and 106 healthy/disease-free or high-risk subjects (as part of the Yale New Haven Hospital Early Detection program (HIC10425). The normal group consisted of 66 healthy/disease-free (including the 28 healthy samples sent for the arrays) and 40 women considered to be at high-risk. Of the 100 ovarian cancer patients, 24 women were diagnosed with Stage VII and 16 women with Stage m/IV EOC. Included in this group were the 18 newly diagnosed OVCA samples. Serum from the healthy/disease-free group served as baseline values or "normal range" values for the presence of carcinoma.<br>
Sera Collection: 10 ml of blood was collected, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. and the serum stored at -80°C in the OB/GYN Tissue bank until further use. Collection, preparation and storage of the blood samples were done utilizing guidelines set by the NCI Intergroup Specimen Banking Committee. Consent for participation in this study was obtained by qualified personnel. Before analyses, the sera was thawed once and 8 (25-50 ul) aliquots stored at -80°C to ensure unnecessary freezing and thawing.<br>
ELISA Assay. The leptin, prolactin and IGF-H kits were purchased from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc. Webster, Texas and the OPN (Osteopontin) from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Assays were performed following kit instructions, and the results were read on a Spectra Max M2 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale California) set to a dual wavelength of 405 nM with the appropriate correction for each assay. Three classifiers: support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-NN) and classification trees were used to analyze results (distinguish the healthy/disease/free from the ovarian cancer patients).<br>
Statistical Analysis: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significance of the protein expression differences detected by RCA microarray immunoassays between subjects with ovarian cancer and healthy subjects, using the GLM procedure of SAS. Reported effect size measures the difference in mean between two groups, normalized by within group standard deviation, and is independent of the sample size:<br>

Effect Size = (Mean_Groupl-Mean_Group2)/ Std_Groupl_Group2 Effect size has a direct association with the predictive ability of a particular variable. Table 9 shows conversions of effect sizes (column 1) to probability (column 2). The example presented in Table 9 is intended to demonstrate the relationship between effect size and predictive ability. For example, with an effect size of 0.3 observed between the two groups, the probability of correctly identifying the groups is 0.56. With an effect size of 1, the probability increases to 0.69.

To differentiate between normal/high risk and ovarian cancer patients, statistical cluster analysis was performed on 4 protein expression markers obtained from patient serum. Three commonly used classification methods were used: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and classification trees (Hastie, et al. 2001). We used 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the classification accuracy.<br>
In addition to these three classification methods, we used a score-based classification method that is more biologically interpretable. The score-based classification system can be carried out as follows: (i) For each marker, find the best<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2005/083440	PCT/US2005/001832<br>
split point to minimize the number of misclassified subjects. The split point defines two intervals: one for normal and another far cancer. A score of 0 is assigned to a subject if its related observation falls in the normal interval; otherwise, a score of 1 is assigned, (ii) Overall, a subject is assigned a score as the sum of these assigned scores from m different markers. Therefore, the range of such score is between 0 and m. (iii) A given threshold (t) is used to predict the disease status for a given subject, e.g. a given subject with a total score equal or less than t is predicted to have normal status, whereas a subject with a score higher than t v/ill be diagnosed to have disease.<br>
The "split point" described above in connection to the described score based classification system may be identified as follows: Suppose there are n samples classified into two groups. For each marker X, let x_l, x_2,..., x__n be the observed measurements. We screen (n-1) split points y_l, y_2,..., y_ (n-1), where y_k-0.5*(x__k + x_ (k+1) ) for k = 1,2,..., n-1. For each split point y_k, there are a_l and a_2 observed measurements less than yjc in the first and the second groups, respectively; and there are b_l and b_2 observed measurements greater than y_k in the first and the second groups, respectively. If the left and the right sides of yjc are assigned to the first and the second groups, respectively, then there are a_2and b_l misclassified samples. If the left and the right sides of yjc are assigned to the second and the first groups, respectively, then there are a_l and b_2 misclassified samples. We choose the assignment that minimizes the number of misclassified samples.<br>
Discussion<br>
Ovarian cancer is a "relatively silent" disease with intra-abdominal inaccessibility which makes the monitoring and early detection of the disease utilizing a non-invasive approach such as serum tumor markers an attractive idea. A simple, reliable, reproducible and rapid screening strategy with adequate sensitivity for early detection is needed to improve our ability to accurately detect pre-malignant change or early stage ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women at increased risk for the development of ovarian cancer. It has been suggested that, in order to be acceptable, any screening strategy for early detection must achieve a minimum of 99.6% specificity, hence the need for a combined regimen of tests since it is unlikely that any<br>
single analyte test will be that specific. In feet, given the rarity of ovarian cancer, very<br>

low levels of false positive classification will result in a large number of women being incorrectly classified as potentially ovarian cancer patients if biomarker screening tests are used as the only means of classification. We assert that initial serum screening for a combination of analytes, followed by transvaginal ultrasound and rnammography or thermal breast imaging, should provide a sufficiently low false positive rate to justify subsequent laparoscopic surgery on individuals with detectable pelvic masses to validate the results of the diagnostic assay. This approach is supported by results of studies in which the combination of CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound detected a significant proportion of preclinical ovarian cancers (Jacobs, Mol Cell Proteomics 3(4):355-366 (2004).<br>
Our approach to identify serum biomarkers was based on a strategy of screening multiple serum proteins by high-throughput microarray analysis to identify biomarkers that had the potential to accurately discriminate between healthy/high-risk and cancer and still have the sensitivity to detect early stage I and H ovarian cancers. Based on the microarray results, a promising subset of biomarkers were selected for further analysis by ELISA. Four of the biomarkers selected based on the microarray data were confirmed as useful for early detection and a high level of sensitivity/specificity using ELISA analysis. Initial confirmation of the utility of biomarkers does not require many analyses if high specificity and sensitivity is sought. Biomarkers can be eliminated based on analysis of 15-20 normal and patient samples once quality control of the ELISA in the hands of the technician performing the assay is established. Analysis of a larger number of samples is required for application of statistical techniques (such as SVM, k-NN and Tree), to determine sensitivity/specificity, split-points and combinatorial strategies. Aiter validating the contribution that each biomarker may contribute to a combined assay, split points for each biomarker are defined and the utility of combinations of two or more markers are explored statistically. Using split points the status of each biomarker is assigned as a binary result (normal versus abnormal levels). The number of biomarkers classified as abnormal is used to define an individual as having or not having cancer, in this case, individuals with three or four biomarkers that are abnormal are classified as having ovarian cancer while subjects with two or fewer biomarkers that are abnormal are classified as not having cancer.<br>

The biomarkers as individual analjrtes may not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity, rather the combination of biomarkers maybe required for a diagnostic test.<br>
Example 2: The Used of the Biomarkers Identified in Ovarian Cancer Patients to Diagnose Breast Cancer and Colon Cancer<br>
Certain samples were analj'zed to determined whether the biomarkers identified above (leptin, prolactin, OPN and IGF-II) were differentially expressed in other types of cancer. The results, shown in Table 9, indicate that the biomarkers identified above can be used to diagnose other types of cancer including breast cancer and colon cancer.<br>
As shown in Table 10, samples corresponding to subjects with cancer could be distinguished from samples from healthy subjects by the differential expression of two or more biomarkers as compared to their predetermined standard. In Table 10, the expression levels indicated in italics and bold corresponds to expression levels outside of the predetermined standard for said biomarker.<br>
