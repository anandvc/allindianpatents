COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"FLAME RETARDANTS WHICH CONTAIN PHOSPHORUS, AND FLAME-RETARDANT THERMOPLASTIC MOULDING COMPOSITIONS"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-	<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
597/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
14/9/2007<br><br>
Flame    retardants    which    contain    phosphorus,    and    flame-retardant thermoplastic moulding compositions<br>
This invention relates to new oligophosphates which act as flame retardants, and 5 to thermoplastic compositions (moulding compositions) which contain them and which exhibit improved dimensional stability under the effect of heat and good processing properties, and also relates to mouldings which are obtainable therefrom.<br>
10 Flame-retardant, impact-resistant modified polycarbonate moulding compositions are known. Compounds which contain phosphorus, particularly aromatic esters of phosphoric acid, are often used as flame retardants on a large industrial scale.<br>
15 US-A 5 061 745 describes polymer mixtures comprising aromatic polycarbonates, ABS graft polymers and/or styrene-containing copolymers and esters of monophosphoric acid as flame retardant additives. One disadvantage of esters of monophosphoric acid is their plasticiser effect, which results in a considerable decrease in the dimensional stability of these polymer compositions<br>
20  under the effect of heat. Moreover, for many applications these compounds are too volatile and exhibit too great a capacity for migration in the polymer composition, which under unfavourable injection moulding conditions can result in the bleeding out of the flame-retardant additive and in unwanted contamination of the surfaces of the injection mould, which is termed a "juicing<br>
25     phenomenon".<br>
Said juicing phenomenon can be very substantially suppressed, and the dimensional stability under the effect of heat of the material can easily be increased, by the use of oligomers of esters of phosphoric acid or mixtures of 30 oligo- and monophosphoric acid esters as flame retardants in PC/ABS-moulding compositions, as described in EP-A 0 363 608 and EP-A 0 640 655. For many<br><br><br>
applications, however, the dimensional stability under the effect of heat which is thereby obtained is still unsatisfactory.<br>
WO 99/07779 describes the use of oligophosphates based on biphenylene 5 dihydroxide as flame retardants in PC/ABS moulding compositions These phosphates exert a significantly reduced plasticiser effect on the polymer composition, so that a greater dimensional stability under the effect of heat can be achieved. However, moulding compositions which are provided with this additive exhibit poor flowability, which in many cases is not satisfactory for the 10     processing of the material by injection moulding.<br>
Other esters of oligophosphoric acid and the use thereof as flame retardants in PC/ABS moulding compositions are described in EP-A 0 816 434 (oligophosphates based on bisphenol S), EP-A 0 672 717 (alkyl-substituted<br>
15 oligophosphates of the p-hydroquinone type), US 5 455 292 (alkyl-substituted oligophosphates based on bisphenol A), US 5 864 004 (oligophosphates based on bisphenol A) and US 5 183 905 (oligophosphates based on phenolphthalein). PC/ABS moulding compositions which are made flame retardant with these compounds do in fact exhibit dimensional stability under the effect of heat which<br>
20 is improved compared with that achieved with conventional flame retardants, but for many applications still do not exhibit sufficient dimensional stability under the effect of heat or exhibit deficiencies in flowability or toughness.<br>
Consequently, the underlying object of the present invention is to provide 25     PC/ABS moulding compositions which exhibit improved dimensional stability under the effect of heat while still exhibiting a good level of toughness and excellent flowability.<br>
This object is achieved by a new compound, which contains phosphorus, of 30     general formula<br><br><br><br><br>
which exhibits a flame retardant effect,<br>
wherein R1 and R2 can be selected individually and independently of each other for each X, and can denote hydrogen, an alkyl which is substituted or unsubstituted with a halogen, a cycloalkyl or an aryl, each comprising 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably comprising 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom X to<br>
or a cycloalkyl structure<br><br>
which they are bonded, form the structure which is optionally substituted with a halogen,<br><br>
10<br><br>
R3 to R8, independently of each other, are identical or different and can denote an alkyl comprising 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a halogen,<br>
x	denotes carbon,<br>
m        denotes an integer from 4 to 7, preferably 4 or 5,<br>
n	denotes an integer from 1 to 30, preferred from 1 to 15, particularly from 1 to<br>
5,<br>
y	is 0 or 1, preferably 1, and<br>
q	denotes numbers which are independent of each other, are identical or<br>
different, and can represent an integer from 0 to 5.<br><br><br>
R1or R2 on a carbon atom X, together with an R1 or R2, on a further carbon atom X', can also form a cyclic structure, for example a cycloalkyl or a cycloalkyl which is substituted with a halogen.<br>
5     The structure<br><br><br><br>
can be cited as an example, wherein R9 and R10 are identical or different, and, independently of each other, denote hydrogen, an alkyl comprising 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a halogen, and q denotes numbers which are independent of each other, 10     are identical or different, and can represent an integer from 0 to 4.<br>
It is also possible for up to two carbon units R1<br>
R2<br>
which are contained in the cyclic structure<br><br><br>
R1<br><br>
R2<br>
15<br>
to be substituted by heteroatom units, for example -0-, -S-, -N-R1 - or -P-R<br>
The present invention further relates to the  aforementioned compounds  as thermoplastic    compositions   which   contain   flame   retardants,   particularly 20     polycarbonate compositions which can also be impact-modified, and to mouldings which contain said thermoplastic compositions.<br><br><br>
The flame retardants according to the invention make it possible to produce thermoplastic compositions or mouldings which exhibit significantly improved dimensional stability under the effect of heat, good flowability and improved properties in relation to solvents (ESC behaviour). 5<br>
The oligophosphates according to the invention can be used as flame retardants in thermoplastic compositions in amounts of 1 to 40 % by weight, preferably 2 to 25 % by weight, most preferably 3 to 20 % by weight, with respect to the weight of the composition.<br>
10<br>
The oligophosphates according to the invention can be produced by the esterification of suitable compounds which contain two aromatic hydroxy functions with a phosphoric acid diphenyl ester halide in the presence of a base, for example. One particularly preferred oligophosphate is obtained, for example,<br>
15 by the esterification of trimethylcyclohexyl(TMC)-bisphenol with phosphoric acid diphenyl ester chloride in the presence of triethylamine, according to the following chemical equation:<br><br>
In addition to the flame retardants described above, the thermoplastic 20 compositions according to the invention, particularly polycarbonate compositions, can also contain other thermoplastic polymers, particularly polyester carbonates, polyesters, ABS graft copolymers and vinyl (co)polymers.

Monomers B.l are preferably mixtures of<br>
B.1.1   50 to 99 parts by weight of aromatic vinyl compounds and/or aromatic<br>
vinyl   compounds   comprising   substituted   nuclei    (e.g.    styrene,    a-<br>

Moreover, these nano-scale particles can be surface-modified with organic molecules   in  order  to   improve  the   compatibility  thereof with  polymers. 10     Hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces can be produced in this manner.<br>
Hydrated aluminas such as boehmite, or TiO2, are particularly preferred.<br>
The average particle diameters of the nano-particles are less than or equal to 15     1000 mn, preferably less than or equal to 500 nm, particularly 1 to 100 nm.<br>
The terms "particle size" and "particle diameter" always denote the average particle diameter d50 as determined by ultracentrifuge measurements according to W. Scholtan et al., Kolloid-Z. and Z. Polymere 250 (1972), pages 782-796. 20<br>
The inorganic powders are incorporated in the thermoplastic moulding composition in amounts from 0 to 40, preferably from 0 to 25, most preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight, with respect to the thermoplastic material.<br>
25 The inorganic compounds can be present as powders, pastes, sols, dispersions or suspensions. Powders can be obtained by precipitation from dispersions, sols or suspensions.<br>
The powders can be incorporated in the thermoplastic moulding compositions by 30     customary methods, for example by the direct kneading or extrusion of moulding compositions and the very finely divided inorganic powders.<br><br><br>
Component E<br>
The flame retardants according to the invention can be used in combination with what are termed anti-dripping agents, which reduce the tendency of the material 5 to drip as burning droplets in the event of fire. Examples of suitable anti-dripping agents include compounds from the classes of substances comprising fluorinated polyolefines, silicones and aramid fibres. These can also be used in the compositions according to the invention. Fluorinated polyolefines are preferably used as anti-dripping agents. 10<br>
Fluorinated polyolefines are known, and are described in the EP-A 0 640 655 for example. They are sold by DuPont under the Trade Mark Teflon® 30N.<br>
These fluorinated polyolefines can be used either in pure form or in the form of a 15 coagulated mixture comprising emulsions of fluorinated polyolefines with emulsions of the graft polymers (component B) or with an emulsion of a copolymer, preferably a styrene/acrylonitrile-based copolymer, wherein the fluorinated polyolefine is mixed as an emulsion with an emulsion of the graft polymer or of the copolymer and is subsequently coagulated. 20<br>
Furthermore, fluorinated polyolefines can be used as a preliminary compound with the graft polymer (component B) or with a copolymer, preferably a styrene/acrylonitrile based copolymer. The fluorinated polyolefines are mixed as powders with a powder or with granules of the graft polymer or copolymer and 25 are compounded in the melt, generally at temperatures from 200 to 330°C in customary processing units such as internal kneaders, extruders or twin-shaft continuous screw devices.<br>
The fluorinated polyolefines can also be used in the form of a master batch<br>
30     which   is   produced   by   the   emulsion   polymerisation   of   at   least   one<br>
monoethylenically   unsaturated   monomer   in  the   presence   of  an   aqueous<br>
dispersion of the fluorinated polyolefine. The preferred monomer components<br><br><br>
are styrene, acrylonitrile and mixtures thereof. After precipitation by acid and subsequent drying, the polymer is used as a free-flowing powder.<br>
The coagulates, preliminary compounds or master batches usually have solids 5 contents of fmorinated polyolefines from 5 to 95 % by weight, preferably 7 to 60 % by weight. The compositions can contain fluorinated polyolefines in amounts from 0 to 4 % by weight, preferably up to 2 % ty weight, and most preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight, with respect to the weight of the composition.<br>
10     F. Other additives<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can also contain at least one of the customary additives such as internal lubricants and demoulding agents, for example pentaerythritol tetrastearate, nucleating agents, anti-static 15 agents, stabilisers, fillers and reinforcing agents such as glass or carbon fibres, talc, wollastonite, mica, kaolin, CaCC&gt;3 and glass flakes, as well as colorants and pigments.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can contain up to 35 % by<br>
20     weight, with respect to the moulding composition, of a further flame retardant<br>
which optionally has a synergistic effect. Examples of further flame retardants<br>
include   compounds   which   contain  phosphorus,   such   as   organophosphates,<br>
organophosphonates,   phosphonatamines   or   phosphazenes,   organic   halogen<br>
compounds such as decabromobisphenyl ether, tetrabromobisphenol, inorganic<br>
25     halogen compounds such as ammonium bromide, nitrogen compounds such as<br>
melamine and melamineformaldehyde resins, inorganic hydroxide compounds<br>
such as Mg or Al hydroxide, inorganic compounds such as antimony oxide, barium<br>
metaborate,    hydroxoantimonate,    zirconium    oxide,    zirconium    hydroxide,<br>
molybdenum oxide, ammonium molybdate, zinc borate, ammonium borate, barium<br>
30     metaborate, talc, silicates, aluminosilicates, silica and tin oxide, as well as siloxane<br>
compounds.<br><br><br>
Apart from the very finely divided inorganic powders cited as component D, talc is also preferably used as a synergistic flame retardant (FR). The term "talc" is to be understood to mean a naturally occurring or synthetically produced talc which is optionally calcined. 5<br>
The chemical composition of pure talc corresponds to the formula 3MgO.4SiO2.H2O and it thus has an MgO content of 31.9 % by weight, an SiO2 content of 63.4 % by weight and a content of chemically bound water of 4.8 % by weight. It is a silicate with a layer structure.<br>
10<br>
Naturally occurring talc materials generally do not have the aforementioned ideal composition, since they are contaminated due to the partial replacement of the magnesium by other elements, by the partial replacement of silicon by aluminium for example, and/or by growths of other minerals such as dolomite, magnesite or<br>
15      chlorite.<br>
Particularly high purity types of talc are preferably used, which are characterised by an MgO content of 28 to 35 % by weight, preferably 30 to 33 % by weight, most preferably 30.5 to 32 % by weight, and an SiO2 content of 55 to 65 % by 20  weight, preferably 58 to 64 % by weight, most preferably 60 to 62.5 % by weight. The most preferred types of talc are further characterised by an A12O3 content less than 5 % by weight, most preferably less than 1 % by weight, particularly less than 0.7 % by weight.<br>
25 The talc according to the invention is advantageously used in the form of finely ground types which are optionally surface-modified (silanised), with a largest average particle size d50 of 
30 The moulding compositions according to the invention are produced by mixing the respective constituents in the known manner and by compounding and extruding them in the melt at temperatures from 200°C to 300°C in customary<br><br><br>
processing units such as internal kneaders, extruders and twin-shaft continuous screw devices.<br>
Mixing of the individual constituents can be effected in the known manner, either 5     successively or simultaneously, and can be conducted either at about 20°C (room temperature) or at an elevated temperature.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can be used for the production of mouldings of any type, which can be produced by injection 10 moulding, extrusion or blow-moulding methods. Another form of processing is the production of mouldings by thermoforming them from previously produced sheet or film.<br>
Example of these mouldings are sheeting, sections, housing parts of all types, 15 e.g. for domestic appliances such as juice presses, coffee machines, mixers; for office equipment such as monitors, printers, copiers; sheeting, tubes, electrical installation conduits, windows, doors and other sections for the construction industry (interior fittings and exterior applications), as well as electrical and electronic parts such as switches, plugs and sockets. 20<br>
In particular, the moulding compositions according to the invention can also be used for the production of the following mouldings or moulded components, for example:<br>
25 Interior fitting components for railway vehicles, ships, aircraft, buses and other motor vehicles, exterior bodywork parts in the automobile industry, housings for electrical appliances which contain miniature transformers, housings for information processing and transmission devices, housings and coverings for medical equipment, massage equipment and housings for it, toy vehicles for<br>
30 children, sheet-like wall elements, housings for safety devices, thermally insulated transport containers, apparatuses for housing or transporting small animals, mouldings for sanitary and bath fittings, covering grilles for ventilation<br><br><br><br>
penings, mouldings for garden buildings and tool sheds or housings for garden equipment.<br>

A tetrafluorethylene polymer as a coagulated mixture comprising a SAN graft polymer emulsion of the aforementioned component B in water and a 5 tetrafluorethylene polymer emulsion in water. The ratio by weight of graft polymer B to tetrafluorethylene polymer E in the mixture was 90 % by weight to 10 % by weight. The tetrafluorethylene polymer emulsion had a solids content of 60 % by weight and an average particle diameter between 0.05 and 0.5 µm. The SAN graft polymer emulsion had a solids content of 34 by weight and an average 10     latex particle diameter of d50 = 0.3 µm.<br>
The emulsion of tetrafluorethylene polymer (Teflon® 30 N) was mixed with the emulsion of SAN graft polymer B and was stabilised with 1.8 % by weight, with respect to polymer solids, of phenolic antioxidants. The mixture was coagulated 15    at 85 to 95°C with an aqueous solution of MgSO4 (Epsom salts) and acetic acid at pH 4 to 5, filtered, and washed until it was practically free from electrolytes; it was then freed from the bulk of the water by centrifugation and thereafter was dried at 100°C to form a powder.<br>

Testing of the moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
The Vicat B and HDT/A resistances to thermal deformation was determined according to DIN 53 460 (ISO 306) and ISO 75, respectively, on bars of 5     dimensions 80 mm x 10 mm x 4 mm.<br>
The notched bar impact value at was determined according to ISO 180/1 A.<br>
The behaviour in fire of the samples was measured according to UL 94 V on bars 10     of thickness 1.6 and 3.2 mm.<br>
The UL 94 V-Test was performed as follows:<br>
Samples of substances were moulded into bars of dimensions 127 mm x 12.7 mm 15    x 1.6 (3.2) mm. The bars were mounted vertically so that the underside of the specimen was situated 305 mm above a strip of wadding material. Each test bar was ignited individually by means of two successive ignition operations of 10 seconds duration, the burning properties after each ignition were observed, and thereafter the sample was assessed. A Bunsen burner with a blue flame 10 mm (3.8 20   inches) high was used to ignite the samples. The gas supplied to the burner was natural gas with a calorific value of 3.73 x 104kj/m3 (1000 BTU per cubic foot).<br>
The UL 94 V-0 Classification covers the properties of materials described below, which  were  tested  according  to the UL  94  V  regulations.  The moulding<br>
25 compositions in this class contained no samples which burned for longer than 10 seconds after each application of the test flame; they did not exhibit a total after-burn time of more than 50 seconds after two applications of the flame to each set of specimens comprising five bars; they contained no specimens which burned away completely down to the holding clamp fixed to the upper end of the<br>
30   specimen; they comprised no specimens which ignited the wadding under the specimen due to burning drops or particles; they also contained no specimens which glowed for longer than 30 seconds after the test flame was removed.<br><br>
Other UL 94 Classifications designate specimens which are less flame-retardant or less self-extinguishing, because they give off flaming droplets or particles and/or exhibit longer total after-burn times. These classifications are denoted by 5 UL 94 V-1 and V-2. N.R. denotes "non-resistant", and is the classification of specimens for which repeated after-burn times of &gt; 30 seconds were observed on the first and/or second application of the flame, or for which the total after-burn time exceeded 250 seconds on all 10 applications of the flame.<br>
10 The stress cracking behaviour (ESC behaviour) was tested on bars of dimensions 80 mm x 10 mm x 4 mm. A mixture of toluene (60 % by volume) and isopropanol (40 by volume) was used as the test medium. The specimens were pre-stretched by means of a template in the form of a circular arc (pre-stretching in percent) and were stored in the test medium at room temperature. The stress<br>
15 cracking behaviour was assessed via the formation of cracks or breaks in the test medium as a function of pre-stretching.<br>
The melt viscosity was determined at 260°C and at a shear rate of 1000 sec*1 according to   DIN  54811.  The  MVR  (melt volume  rate)  was  determined 20     according to ISO 1133 at 240°C using a plunger load of 5 kg.<br>
The properties of the compositions according to the invention or of mouldings obtained therefrom are listed in Table 1.<br><br><br>
