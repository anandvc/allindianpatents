The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
METHODS FOR ?/-DEMETHYLATION OF MORPHINE AND TROPANE<br><br>
ALKALOIDS<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0001] The present invention relates to ?/-methylated compounds and methods for ?/-demethylation of same. In particular the present invention relates to morphine and tropane alkaloids and their derivatives and methods for N- demethylation of same.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0002] The semisynthesis of morphine-derived antagonists, such as naloxone, see compound 5 below, and naltrexone see compound 6 below, and other medicinally significant compounds, from opium-derived natural products traditionally involves standard procedures for demethylation followed by subsequent procedures such as oxidative procedures for the introduction of a C-14 hydroxyl group.<br><br>
t naloxone • na'fr8*006  <br><br>
[0003] Most commercial procedures for the production of C-14 hydroxylated species take advantage of ?7-8 unsaturated species, however compounds containing a, ß-unsaturated ketones have recently been identified as potential genotoxins because of their Michael acceptor character, and therefore routes to the oxygenated derivatives must avoid these intermediates.<br><br>
[0004] Therefore any method that avoids these standard procedures may hold immense commercial potential for the production of morphine-derived antagonists, such as naloxone 5, naltrexone 6, and other medicinally significant compounds. <br><br>
[0005] The development of a mild catalytic protocol for ?/-demethylation of ring-C saturated morphinans would simplify strategies toward C-14 oxygenated derivatives via potential use of an intramolecular process by tethered functionalisation anchored at the nitrogen atom.<br><br>
[0006] ?/-Demethylation of morphine-type alkaloids has been extensively studied. The standard procedures for ?/-demethylation of substrates including morphinan derived compounds include the use of cyanogen bromide (the von Braun reaction), the reaction of a tertiary amine with chloroformates followed by hydrolysis, as well as a photochemical demethylation procedure. Other methods that have been used to effect demethylation include amongst others, Polonovski-type reactions. Precedent for a Pd-catalyzed oxidative demethylation procedure using stoichiometric amounts of Pd/C, appears in a single report by Chaudhuri<br><br>
[0007] Chaudhuri's method describes the use of Pd/C (1g/1g substrate) in<br><br>
MeOH at room temperature to dealkylate tertiary amines. On occasion he notes that small amounts of ?/-formyl species were isolated. This was an undesired side reaction for his methodology. Application of the conditions described in this paper to hydrocodone results in no ?/-demethylation. The only product recovered was N- formyl hydrocodone. Thus, there remained a need for a truly practical method for the production of demethylated morphine derivatives.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0008] An investigation of the chemistry of morphine alkaloids and their derivatives, such as hydrocodone 3, and oxycodone 4, led to the present invention, which involves a method for a one-pot oxidative ?/-demethylation.<br><br>
[0009] In one aspect the present invention provides a one-pot method for N- demethylation of /V-methylated compounds.<br><br>
[0010] The present invention provides a one-pot method for the N- demethylation of an ?/-methylated heterocycle comprising mixing the ?/-methylated heterocycle with a metal catalyst in the presence of an oxidizing agent. <br><br>
[0011] In a preferred embodiment, the ?/-methylated heterocycle is selected from the group consisting of a morphine alkaloid, a tropane alkaloid and derivatives thereof. The morphine alkaloid is selected from the group below: thebaine, oripavine, 14-hydroxycodeinone, 14-hydroxymorphinone, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, hydromorphol and oxymorphol. A preferred morphine alkaloid is hydrocodone. The tropane alkaloid is preferably selected from the group consisting of tropinone, tropane, tropine, atropine, cocaine or any other bicyclo-[3.2.1]-azabicyclic methylamines.<br><br>
[0012] In one embodiment of the invention the metal catalyst can also act as the oxidizing agent.<br><br>
[0013] In another embodiment of the invention the oxidizing agent is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, m- CPBA, peracetic acid, magnesium mono peroxyphthalate; palladium, palladium acetate and combinations thereof. In a further preferred embodiment, the oxidizing agent is palladium acetate or ammonium persulfate.<br><br>
[0014] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is selected from the group consisting of: CuCI, CuI, CuOAc2, CuCO3, CuSO4, CuCI2, CuO, Pd(OAc)2, PdCI2, PdCI2(PPh3)4, PdBr2, Pd(acac)2, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Fe dust, Cu, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ge, Sn1 Os, Ag, Au, Pb.<br><br>
[0015] In another preferred embodiment, the catalyst is a copper catalyst selected from the group consisting of Cu, CuCI, CuI, Cu(OAc)2, CuCO3, CuSO4, CuCI2, and CuO. In a further preferred embodiment the catalyst is Cu(OAc)2.<br><br>
[0016] In yet another embodiment the preferred catalyst is selected from the group consisting of Pd(OAc)2, PdCI2, PdCI2(PPh3J4, PdBr2, Pd(acac)2, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, most preferably Pd(OAc)2.<br><br>
[0017] The catalyst is preferably present in the range of from about 0.1 equivalents to about 5.0 equivalents, more preferably in the range of from about 1.0 equivalents to 2.5 equivalents, most preferably in about 2.5 equivalents. <br><br>
[0018] In a preferred embodiment the catalyst is present in the range of from about 1.0 equivalents to 2.5 equivalents and the oxidizing agent is present in the range of 2.0 equivalents to 4.0 equivalents.<br><br>
[0019] In a further preferred embodiment the catalyst is a copper salt and the oxidizing agent is ammonium persulfate.<br><br>
[0020] In another aspect at least one solvent is added to the reaction mixture.<br><br>
The solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, benzene, dioxane, toluene, acetonitrile, C1 to C4 alcohols and mixtures thereof. One preferred solvent is acetonitrile: water in a ratio of about 5:1.<br><br>
[0021] In another aspect of the invention, demethylated products obtained by the method of the invention are also encompassed within the invention.<br><br>
[0022] The development of a Pd or Cu catalyst mediated demethylation method for the ?/-demethylation of morphinan alkaloids provides a very practical way to obtain normorphine products.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0023] The present invention provides a one-pot method for catalysed N- demethylation of N-methylated heterocycles. The method is particularly useful for the demethylation morphine alkaloids or tropane alkaloids to provide highly desired products. The method of the invention is highly reproducible and efficient.<br><br>
[0024] Briefly, the method comprises reacting an alkaloid substrate with a metal catalyst in the presence of an oxidizing agent. In some cases, the metal itself can act as an oxidizing agent. Atmospheric oxygen can also act as an oxidizing agent. In other cases, an additional oxidizing agent is added.<br><br>
[0025] Various types of alkaloids such as oripavine, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, tropinone, tropane, tropine, atropine, cocaine, and bicyclo-[3.2.1]-azabicyclic methylamines can be demethylated using the methods of the invention. <br><br>
[0026] While a preferred morphine alkaloid derivative is hydrocodone and the examples focus on the demethylation of hydrocodone, it is apparent that other alkaloids can also be demethylated by the present methods.<br><br>
[0027] Various types of catalyst can be used to obtain demethylated products.<br><br>
Palladium-based catalyst such as PdCI2, Pd(OAc)2, Pd(PPh3J4 and Pd(dba)2 have been shown to be particularly useful. Pd(OAc)2 in particular, results in significant yields of product.<br><br>
[0028] Copper based catalysts have also been shown to be excellent catalysts for use in the method. A particularly effective catalyst is Cu(OAc)2.<br><br>
[0029] Under certain conditions, it is desirable to include a solvent. The solvent is typically water, benzene, dioxane, toluene, acetonitrile, Ci to C4 alcohols or a mixture of any of these.<br><br>
[0030] Without being limiting, the following conditions are usually used:<br><br>
(a) The substrate is dissolved in a solvent;<br><br>
(b) A catalyst is added;<br><br>
(c) An oxidant is added;<br><br>
(d) The reaction proceeds from about 8 to 40 hours, optionally at room temperature, optionally at an elevated temperature;<br><br>
(e) The solvent is removed;<br><br>
(f) The residue is resuspended in an aqueous basic medium;<br><br>
(g) The aqueous phase is extracted, dried and filtered, and<br><br>
(h) Any remaining volatiles are removed.<br><br>
[0031] While the basic steps of the methods remain constant, the optimal conditions for demethylation vary, depending upon the starting substrate, the catalyst used, the solvent used, the length of the reaction and temperature of the reaction. As <br><br>
discussed above, various types of substrate, catalyst and oxidants can be used. Reaction times typically vary from about 8 to 40 hours depending on the catalyst and temperature. Demethylated compounds have been recovered at reaction temperatures ranging from room temperature to about 90'. For example, when palladium acetate is used as a catalyst for the demethylation of hydrocodone in the presence of benzene, optimal yield is achieved when the reaction is heated to about 80' and the reaction proceeds for 36 hours. On the other hand, the combination of Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst with (NHU)2S2O8 as the oxidizing agent was shown to be highly efficient after a reaction time of 9 hours at room temperature. The relative amounts of the substrate, the catalyst and the oxidant also affects the yield.<br><br>
[0032] Concentrations of about 0.01 - 100 mL solvent/gram of alkaloid is typically used in a small scale reaction.<br><br>
[0033] The amount of catalyst is typically in the range of about 1 equivalent to<br><br>
4 equivalents, more preferably about 2.0 equivalents to 2.5 equivalents, most preferably about 2.5 equivalents.<br><br>
[0034] Dioxane, benzene and acetonitrile are preferred solvents. In particular a ratio of about 5:1 acetonitrile to water is effective.<br><br>
[0035] A few exemplary procedures are shown in the Examples below.<br><br>
Although these examples focus on the demethylation of hydrocodone and codeine, it is apparent that the general chemistry can be applied to other morphine and tropane alkaloids and that other catalysts and oxidants that function in a similar manner to those used in the specific examples are also useful in the invention.<br><br>

It is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the preceding description, make and use the compositions and practice the methods of the present invention.
