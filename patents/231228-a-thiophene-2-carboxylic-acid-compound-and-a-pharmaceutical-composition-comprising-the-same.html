				<td>COMPOUNDS AMD_ METHODS FOR THB TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF FLAVIVIRUS INFECTIONS<br>
FIELD OF TOE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds and &amp; method for the treatment or prevention of Flavivirus infections using novel compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis is a disease occurring throughout the world. It is generally of viral nature, although there are other causes known. Viral hepatitis is by far the most common, form of hepatitis. Nearly 750,000 Americans are affected by hepatitis each year, and out of those, more than 150,000 are infected with the hepatitis C virus ("HCV"). »<br>
HCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and has closest relationship to the peativiruses that include hog cholera virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV).  HCV is believed to replicate through the production of a complementary negative-strand RNA template. Due to the lack of efficient culture replication system for the virus, HCV particles were isolated from pooled human plasma and shown, by electron microscopy, to have a diameter of about 50-60 nm. The HCV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of about 9,600 bp coding for a<br>
polyprotein of 3009-3030 amino-acids, which is cleaved co and post-translationally by cellular and two viral proteinases into mature viral proteins (core, El, E27 . p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) .  It is believed that the structural proteins, El and E2, the major glycoproteins are embedded into a viral lipid envelope and form stable heterodimers. It is also believed that the structural core protein interacts with the viral RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid.  The nonstructural proteins designated NS2 to NS5 include proteins with enzymatic functions involved in virus replication and protein processing including a polymerase, protease and helicase.<br>
The main source of contamination with HCV is blood.  The magnitude of the HCV infection as a health problem is illustrated by the prevalence among high-risk groups. For example, 60% to 90% of hemophiliacs and more than 80% of intravenous drug abusers in western countries are chronically infected with HCV.  For intravenous drug abusers, the prevalence varies from about 28% to 70% depending on the population studied.  The proportion of new HCV infections associated with post-tranafusion has b'een markedly reduced lately due to advances in diagnostic tools used to screen blood donors.<br>
The only treatment currently available for HCV infection is interferon-a (IFN-a). However, according to different clinical studies, only 70% of treated patients normalize alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the serum and after discontinuation of IFN, 35%'to 45% of<br>
these responders relapse. In general, only 20% to 25% of patients have long-term responses to IFN.  Clinical studies have shown that combination treatment with IFN and ribavirin (RIBA) results in a superior clinical response than IFN alone. Different genotypes of HCV respond differently to IFN therapy, genotype Ib is more resistant to IFN therapy than type 2 and 3.<br>
There is therefore a great need for the development of anti-viral agents.<br>

Compounds were evaluated using an In vitro polymerase assay containing purified recombinant HCV RNA -dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B protein).  HCV NS5B was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus as vector. The experimental procedures used for the cloning, expression and purification of the HCV NS5B protein are described below. Follows , are details of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays used to test the compounds.<br>
Expression of the HCV NS5B protein in insect cells: 5 The cDNA encoding the entire NS5B protein of HCV -Bk strain, genotype Ib, was amplified by PCR using the primers NSSNheS' (5'-GCTAGCGCTAGCTCAATGTCCTACACATGG-3'.) and XhoNSSS' (5' -CTCGAGCTCGAGCGTCCATCGGTTGGGGAG-3') and the plasmid pCD 3.8-9.4 as template (Tomei et i al, 1993). NSSNheS' and XhoNS53' contain two Nhel and Xhol sites (underlined sequences), respectively, at their 5' end.  The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in the bacterial expression plasmid pET-21b (Novagen) between the restriction sites Nhel and Xhol, to generate the plasmid pET/NS5B. This pjasmid was later used as template to PCR-amplify the NS5B coding region, using the primers NS5B-H9 (5'~ ATACATATGGCTAGCATGTCAATGTCCTACACATGG - 3') and NS5B -R4 (5' -GGATCCGGATCCCGTTCATCGGTTGGGGAG- 3') •  NS5B-H9 spans a region of 15 nucleotides in the plasmid pET -21b followed by the translation initiation codon (ATG) and<br>
8 nucleotideb corresponding to the 5f end of the NS5B coding region (nt. 1590-7607 in the HCV sequence with the accession number M58335). NS5B-R4 contains two BamHI sites (underlined) followed by 18 nucleotides corresponding to the region around the stop codon in the HCV genome (nt. 9365-9347).  The amplified sequence, of 1.8 kb, was digested with Nhel and iamHI and ligated to a predigested pBlueBacII plasmid (Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant plastnid was designated pBac/NS5B. Sf9 cells were co -transfected with 3 ug of pBac/NS5B, together with 1 ug of linearized baculovirus DNA (Invitrogen), aa described in the manufacturer's protocol. Following two rounds of plaque purification, an NS5B-recombinant baculovirus, BacNSBB, was isolated. The presence of the recombinant NS5B protein was determined by western blot analysis (Harlow and Lane, 1988) of BacNSSB-infected Sf9 cells, using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (anti-NS5B) raised against a His-tagged version of the NS5B protein expressed in E, coli. Infections of Sf9 cells with this plaque purified virus were performed in one-liter apinner flasks at a cell density of 1.2 x 10fi cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 5.<br>
Preparation of a soluble recombinant NS5B protein Sf9 cells were infected as described above.  Sixty hours post-infection, cells were harvested then washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS).  Total proteins were solubilized as described in Lohmann et al, (1997) with some modifications.  In brief.<br>
proteins were extracted in three, steps, SI, 52, S3, using lysis buffers (LB) I, LB II and LB III (Lohmann et al, 1997). The composition of LBII was modified to contain 0.1 % triton X-100 and 150 tnM NaCl to reduce the amount of solubilized NS5B protein at this step. In addition, sonication of cell extracts was avoided throughout the protocol to preserve the integrity of the protein structure.<br>
Purification of reeombinant N35B using fast protein, liguid chroma toerraphy (PPLC) ;<br>
Soluble NS5B protein in the S3 fraction was diluted to lower the NaCl concentration to 300 mM, then it incubated batchwise with DEAE sepharose beads (Amers'ham-Pharmacia). for 2 hrs at 4°C, as described by Behrens et al. (1996). Unbound material was cleared by centrifugation- for 15 min at 4°C, at 25 000 rpm using a SW41 rotor (Beckman).  The supernatant was further diluted to lower the NaCl concentration to 200 mM and subsequently loaded, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, on a 5 ml HiTrap® heparin column (Amersham -Pharmacia) connected to an FPLC® system (Amersham-Pharmacia). Bound proteins were eluted in 1 ml fractions, using a continuous NaCl gradient- of 0.2 to 1 M, over a 25 ml volume. NS5B-containing fractions were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS -PAGE), followed by western blotting using the anti -NS5B antiserum at a dilution of 1:2000, Positive fractions were pooled and the elution buffer was exchanged<br>
against a 50 mM NaP04 pH 7.0, 20 % glycerol, 0.5 % trifcon X-100 and 10 mM DTT, using a PD-10 column (Amersham-Pharmacia) . The sample was then loaded onto a 1 ml HiTrap® SP column (Araersham-Pharmacia), with a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted using a continuous o to 1 M NaCl gradient over a 15 ml volume. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS -PAGE and western blotting. Alternatively, proteins were visualized, following SDS-PAGE, by silver staining using the Silver Stain Plus kit (BioRad) as de scribed by the manufacturer. Positive fractions were tested for RdRp activity (see below) and the most active ones were pooled, and stored as a 40 % glycerol solution at<br>

The template and primers were denatured at 95 C for 5 minutes then incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes. Annealed template-primers were subsequently diluted in a Tris-HCl containing buffer and allowed to bind to streptavidin-coated flashplates overnight. Unbound<br>
  material was discarded, compounds were added in a 10 ul solution followed by a' 10 ul of a solution containing 50 .tnM MgCl2/ 100 raM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 5 raM DTT.  The enzymatic reaction was initiated upon addition of a 30 ul solution containing the enzyme and substrate to obtain the following concentrations: 25 uM UTP, 1 uCi [3H] UTP and 100 nM recombinant HCV NS5B. RdRp reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 hrs at room temperature after' which wells were washed three times with a 250 uL of 0.15 M NaCl solution, air dried at 37 C, and counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Microbeta Trilex, Perkin-Elmer, MA, USA). Results are shown in Table'1.<br>
