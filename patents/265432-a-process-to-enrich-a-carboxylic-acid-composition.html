This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/682,767 filed on 5/19/2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process and resulting enriched carboxylic acid compositions produced by contacting a carboxylic acid composition with an enrichment feed in an enrichment zone to form an enriched carboxylic acid composition. This invention also relates to a process and the resulting compositions for removing catalyst from a cooled carboxylic acid composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Terephthalic acid is commercially produced by oxidation of paraxylene in the presence of at least one catalyst, such as, for example, Co, Mn, and Br catalyst and a solvent, typically acetic acid. Terephthalic acid is typically made in a manner to remove impurities formed as a result of the oxidation of paraxylene.<br>
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is an intermediate in the production of condensation polymers and copolymers especially polyesters and co-polyesters for plastics, fibers, films, coatings, containers, and other articles. Of particular commercial importance is poly(ethylene terephthalate), referred to as PET, a polyester of TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), as well as related copolyesters. Commercial processes for the manufacture of TPA are often based on the multi-valent transition<br>
metal catalyzed oxidation of p-xylene, generally with a bromide promoter in an acetic acid solvent. Due to the limited solubility of TPA in acetic acid under practical oxidation conditions, a slurry of crystalline agglomerate containing primarily TPA is usually formed in the oxidation reactor. Typically, the TPA oxidizer slurry is withdrawn from the reactor, and TPA solids are separated from the oxidizer mother liquor using conventional solid-liquid separation techniques. The oxidizer mother liquor stream, which contains most of the catalyst and promoter used in the process, is recycled to the oxidation reactor. In addition to the catalyst and promoter, the oxidizer mother liquor stream also contains dissolved TPA and many by-products, impurities, and other compounds. These other compounds, oxidation by-products and impurities arise partially from compounds present in minor amounts in the p-xylene feed stream. Other compounds and oxidation by-products arise due to the incomplete oxidation of p-xylene resulting in partially oxidized products. Still other compounds and oxidation by-products result from competing side reactions formed as a result of the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid. Patents disclosing the production of terephthalic acid such as U.S patent #4,158,738 and #3,996,271 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the extent that they do not contradict statements herein.<br>
Many of the compounds in the oxidizer mother liquor stream that are recycled are relatively inert to further oxidation, but are not inert to further reaction including decomposition and conversion to other compounds. Such compounds include, for example, isophthalic acid (IPA), benzoic acid, and phthalic acid. Compounds in the oxidizer mother liquor stream, which may undergo further oxidation are also present, such as, for example in the case of oxidation of p-xylene (also known as 1,4-dimethylbenzene), compounds such as 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, p-toluic acid, p-tolualdehyde and terephthaldehyde. Compounds that are relatively inert to oxidation and are not otherwise removed from the process tend to accumulate in the oxidizer mother liquor stream upon recycle.<br>
Conventionally, crude terephthalic acid (CTA) is purified either by conversion to a dimethyl ester or by dissolution in water with subsequent hydrogenation over standard hydrogenation catalysts. More recently, secondary oxidative treatments instead of hydrogenation have been used to produce polymer-grade TPA. It is desirable to minimize the concentration of impurities in the mother liquor and thereby facilitate subsequent purification of TPA. In some cases, it is not possible to produce a purified, polymer-grade TPA unless some means for removing impurities from the oxidizer mother liquor stream is utilized.<br>
One technique for impurity removal commonly used in the chemical processing industry is to draw out or "purge" some portion of the mother liquor stream as a recycle stream. Typically, the purge stream is simply disposed of or, if economically justified, subjected to various treatments to remove undesired impurities while recovering valuable components. One example of this purge process is U.S. Patent # 4,939,297 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent that it does not contradict statements herein.<br>
The purification of CTA to produce purified terephthalic acid (PTA) increases the manufacturing cost of the PTA. It is desirable to maximize the concentration of by-products, impurities, and other compounds in the terephthalic acid to the extent that the terephthalic acid remains useful, especially in making poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) polymer and articles therefrom, such as, film, containers, and fiber.<br>
One example of utility is the improved yield in a carboxylic acid process, particularly a terephthalic acid process. Another utility of this invention is the flexibility of controlling the destination of specific compounds in the process. For example, a portion of specific compounds can be retained on the product in a catalyst removal zone, and or enriched in the product in the enrichment zones such that they go out with the product stream, or are allowed to exit the process. Yet another utility is the process allows the option of placing compounds on the product stream that are not in the TPA process. Another utility is the<br>
option of adding a comonomer, to the TPA product stream, for example, IPA, can be added.<br>

In this specification and in the claims, which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings:<br>
As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a catalyst removal zone includes one or more catalyst removal zones.<br>
Ranges may be expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value<br>
and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase "optionally heated" means that the material may or may not be heated and that such phrase includes both heated and unheated processes. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, a portion means at least 10% by weight of the liquid is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion means at least 15% by weight of the liquid is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion means at least 25% by weight of the liquid is removed.

The solid-liquid separator in the liquid displacement zone 40 may be operated in continuous or batch mode, although it will be appreciated that for commercial processes, the continuous mode is preferred.<br>
A portion of the oxidation byproducts are displaced from the liquid displacement zone 40 in a mother liquor and withdrawn via line 60. In one embodiment of the invention, additional solvent is fed to the liquid displacement zone 40 via line 50 to reslurry the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 and form a slurry composition 70. The mother liquor 60 is withdrawn from liquid displacement zone 40 via line 60 and comprises a solvent, typically acetic acid, catalyst, and at least one oxidation byproduct(s). The mother liquor in line 60 may either be sent to a process for separating impurities from oxidation solvent via lines not shown or recycled to the catalyst system via lines not shown. One technique for impurity removal from the mother liquor 60 commonly used in the chemical processing industry is to draw out or "purge" some portion of the recycle stream. Typically, the purge stream is simply<br>
disposed of, or if economically justified, subjected to various treatments to remove undesired impurities while recovering valuable components. Examples of impurity removal processes include U.S. Patent # 4,939,297 and U.S. Patent 4,356,319, herein incorporated by reference to the extent that they do not contradict statements made herein.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention a process is described that can allow for the controlled partitioning of at least one selected compound, by-product or impurity among the filtration mother liquor, wash feed, and terephthalic acid wet cake while achieving recovery of the oxidization catalyst and oxidation reaction solvent or medium.<br>
Also in embodiments of this invention, the purge process can be significantly reduced or eliminated by the enrichment of a post catalyst removal composition 200 with selected compounds. The enrichment process results in these compounds being carried out with the enriched composition 240 or the dried carboxylic acid composition 280, therefore greatly reducing or eliminating a purge process. The enrichment can be preceded by a catalyst removal process.<br>
It should be pointed out that the liquid displacement zone 40 is optional and also can be located in multiple locations in the process as shown in Figure 2 by the dashed lines. In another embodiment of the invention, there are more than one liquid displacement zone(s) 40 such as, for example, between the primary oxidation zone 20 and staged oxidation zone 80, and another liquid displacement zone 40 can be located either after the staged oxidation zone 80 or after the crystallization zone 120. There could be three liquid displacement zones 40 as shown in Figure 2 or any combination as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Step (c) comprises optionally oxidizing the slurry composition 70 or a crude carboxylic acid composition 30 in a staged oxidation zone 80 to form a staged oxidation composition 110.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the slurry composition 70 or a crude carboxylic acid composition 30 is withdrawn via line 70 to a staged oxidation zone 80 and can be heated to between about 140°C to about 280°C. Another range is between about 160°C to about 240°C,<br>
another range is between about 170°C to about 200°C, and further oxidized with air fed by line 106 to produce a staged oxidation composition 110. Another range is about 180°C to about 280°C.<br>
The staged oxidation zone 80 comprises at least one staged oxidation reactor vessel. The slurry composition 70 is fed to the staged oxidation zone 80. The term "staged" means that the oxidation occurs in both the primary oxidation zone 20 discussed previously as well as in the staged oxidation zone 80. For example, the staged oxidation zone 80 can comprise staged oxidation reactor vessels in series.<br>
When the carboxylic acid is terephthalic acid, the staged oxidation zone 80 comprises an oxidation reactor that can be heated to between about 140°C to about 280°C or between about 160°C to about 240, or between about 170°C to about 200°C, or between about 160°C to about 210°C, and further oxidized with air or a source of molecular oxygen fed by line 106 to produce a staged oxidation composition 110. In an embodiment of the invention, oxidation in the staged oxidation zone 80 is at a higher temperature than the oxidation in the primary oxidation zone 20 to enhance the impurity removal. The staged oxidation zone 80, as well as streams 30 and 70, can be heated directly with solvent vapor, or steam, or indirectly by any means known in the art. Purification in the staged oxidation zone 80 takes place by a mechanism involving recrystallization or crystal growth and oxidation of impurities.<br>
Additional air or molecular oxygen may be fed via conduit 106 to the staged oxidation zone 80 in an amount necessary to oxidize at least a portion of the partially oxidized products, such as, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) and p-toluic acid in the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 or slurry composition 70 to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Generally, at least 70% by weight of the 4-CBA is converted to terephthalic acid in the staged oxidation zone 80. Preferably, at least 80% by weight of the 4-CBA is converted to terephthalic acid in the staged oxidation zone 80. Significant concentrations of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and p-toluic acid in the<br>
terephthalic acid product are particularly detrimental to polymerization processes as they may act as chain terminators during the condensation reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
Impurities in the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 or slurry composition 70 go into solution as the terephthalic acid particles are dissolved and re-crystallized in the staged oxidation zone 80. Offgas from the staged oxidation zone 80 is withdrawn and can be fed to a recovery system where the solvent is removed from the offgas comprising volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs including methyl bromide may be treated, for example, by incineration in a catalytic oxidation unit. The offgas may also be processed before the staged oxidation composition 110 from the staged oxidation zone 80 is withdrawn via line 110.<br>
Step (d) comprises optionally crystallizing the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 or the staged oxidation composition 110 in a crystallization zone 120 to form a crystallized slurry composition 160. Generally, the crystallization zone 120 comprises at least one crystallizer. Vapor product from the crystallization zone 120 can be condensed in at least one condenser and returned to the crystallization zone 120.   Optionally, the liquid from the condenser or vapor product from the crystallization zone 120 can be recycled, or it can be withdrawn or sent to an energy recovery device.<br>
In addition, the crystallizer offgas is removed and can be routed to a recovery system where the solvent is removed and crystallizer offgas comprising VOCs may be treated, for example, by incineration in a catalytic oxidation unit.<br>
The staged oxidation composition 110 from the staged oxidation zone 80 is withdrawn via line 110 and fed to a crystallization zone 120 comprising at least one crystallizer where it is cooled to a temperature between about 110°C to about 190°C to form a crystallized slurry<br>
composition 160, preferably to a temperature between about 140°C to about 180°C, and most preferably about 150°C to about 170°C.<br>
The crystallized slurry composition 160 from the crystallization zone 120 is withdrawn via line 160. Typically, the crystallized slurry composition 160 is then fed directly to a vessel and cooled to form a cooled carboxylic acid composition 170. When the carboxylic acid is terephthalic acid, the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170 is cooled in a vessel to typically a temperature of about 160°C or less, preferably to about 100°C or less, before being introduced into a process for recovering the terephthalic acid as a dry powder or wet cake.<br>
Step (e) comprises optionally cooling the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 in a cooling zone 165 to form a cooled carboxylic acid composition 170.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 is fed to a cooling zone 165 and cooled to a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 90°C to form the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170.

acid composition 30 is fed to a cooling zone 165 and cooled to a temperature ranging from about 10°C to about 90°C to form the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170. In another embodiment of the invention, the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 is fed to a cooling zone 165 and cooled to a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 60°C to form the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170. In another embodiment of the invention, the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 is fed to a cooling zone 165 and cooled to a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 40°C to form the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a portion of the solvent is optionally removed from the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30 via conduit 163 to produce the cooled carboxylic acid composition 170. In one embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean any part up to and including the whole. A portion can mean at least 5% by weight of the solvent is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean at least 10% by weight of the solvent is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean at least 25% by weight of the solvent is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean at least 50% by weight of the solvent is removed. In another embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean at least 75% by weight of the solvent is removed.

In another embodiment of the invention, a portion can mean at least 90% by weight of the solvent is removed from the crystallized slurry composition 160 or the staged oxidation composition 110 or the slurry composition 70 or the crude carboxylic acid composition 30.<br>
Solvent removal can be accomplished by any means known in the art. For example, the solvent can be removed by evaporation or by flashing and removing the solvent under vacuum.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, both cooling and solvent removal are utilized.<br>
Steps (a) through steps (d) and steps (a) through (e) are to illustrate embodiments of the invention in which a cooled carboxylic acid composition 170 is produced.    In should also be pointed out that the liquid displacement zone 40, the staged oxidation zone 80, and the crystallization zone 120 were all optional in this embodiment of the invention. For example, other processes that produce a cooled carboxylic acid composition 170, or a crystallized slurry composition 160, or a staged oxidation composition 110, or a slurry composition 70, or a crude carboxylic acid composition 30 can be utilized. Such processes are described in US patents 5,877,346; 4,158,738; 5,840,965; 5,877,346; US 5,527,957; and US 5,175,355, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety to the extent that they do not contradict statements made herein.

In addition, as shown in Figure 4, any process known in the art capable of producing a crude carboxylic acid composition 30 or a slurry composition 70 can be utilized<br>

For example, in an embodiment of the invention depicted on Figure 1a and 1 b, the primary outlet stream is the enriched composition 240 and the primary inlet stream is the post catalyst removal composition 200. In an embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 9, the primary inlet stream is the carboxylic acid composition 214, or the crystallized slurry composition 160, and the primary outlet stream is the enriched carboxylic acid stream 280. In an embodiment of the invention, depicted in Figure 10, the primary inlet stream is the carboxylic acid composition 214, and the primary outlet stream is the enriched carboxylic acid composition 216.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the termed "enriched" means that the primary outlet stream has a greater concentration of any selected compound(s) as described previously by at least 5 ppmw, or at least 10 ppmw, or at least 100 ppmw, or at least 1000 ppmw, or at least 5 wt%, or at least 10 wt%, or at least 25 wt%, or at least 30 wt% or at least 50 wt% than the primary inlet stream, all measured on a dry solid basis.<br>

There are no special limitations as far as the conditions of the enrichment feed 220 other than it comprises compounds sufficient to enrich the post catalyst removal composition 200 with the enrichment compound(s) specified previously. For example, the enrichment feed 220 can be, but is not limited to a cake, powder, solids, wash feed, slurry, solution, paste, or gas entrained solid or liquid.<br>
It should be pointed out that the enrichment feed 220 does not necessarily need to be introduced into the enrichment zone 210. As shown in Figure 8, the enrichment feed 220 can be introduced in a number of locations including, but not limited to, the enrichment zone 210, dewatering zone 250, drying zone 270, and in the polyester processes, or more specifically PET processes. A variety of polyester processes have been developed. Early efforts used reactive distillation as shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,905,707 and reactive distillation with ethylene glycol ("EG") vapor as reactants as shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,829,153 to produce PET: both of these patents are herein<br>
incorporated by reference to the extent they do not contradict statements made herein. Multiple stirred pots have been disclosed to gain additional control of the reaction as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,110,316, herein incorporated by reference to the extent it does not contradict statement made herein. U.S. Patent No. 3,054,776 discloses the use of lower pressure drops between reactors in a PET process, while U.S. Patent No. 3,385,881 discloses multiple reactor stages within one reactor shell, both of these patents are herein incorporated by reference to the extent they do not contradict statement made herein. These designs were improved to solve problems with entrainment or plugging, heat integration, heat transfer, reaction time, the number of reactors, etc., as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,118,843; 3,582,244; 3,600,137; 3,644,096; 3,689,461; 3,819,585; 4,235,844; 4,230,818; and 4,289,895; all of which are herein incorporated by reference to the extent that they do not contradict statements made herein.<br>
In a PET process 400 as shown in Figure 8, the enrichment feed 220 can be introduced in the paste tank, esterification reactors, and/or other locations in the process. The enrichment feed 220 can be introduced in multiple locations or at only one location, either at one time or gradually over time.<br>
Raw materials for manufacturing step-growth polymers and copolymers from terephthalic acid (TPA) include monomers and co-monomers, catalyst(s), and additives. Monomers and co-monomers include, but are not limited to, diamines, diols, and diacids, etc. Important commercial step-growth polymers which can be made using TPA as a monomer or co-monomer include polyamides, polyesters, especially poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), co-polyamides, co-polyesters, and co-polyester-amides. It can be advantageous to introduce and achieve intimate mixing of the monomers or co-monomers, catalyst(s) and/or additives with the terephthalic acid, so that they do not have to be added to the polymerization process separately from the TPA. A process has been invented that allows for the production of terephthalic acid, in the form of powder, paste, wet cake,<br>
or slurry, and which is enriched with certain monomers or co-monomers, catalyst(s) and/or additives. This process is achieved with intimate mixing with TPA so as to obviate the need for separate addition of the materials in the PET manufacturing process.<br>
The following description will be given for PET, but can be extended in a straight-forward manner to other step-growth polymers and copolymers made using TPA. The manufacture of PET involves the esterification of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol, formation of a prepolymer, and polycondensation to form PET with a molecular weight high enough for the intended subsequent polymer processing and application which can include coatings, fibers, films, containers, and other articles. Certain monomers or co-monomers, catalyst(s) and/or additives can also be used. The most common co-monomers, beside ethylene glycol (EG), are isophthalic acid (I PA or PIA) and cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). The most common catalysts for PET manufacture are antimony and titanium. Additives useful in the manufacture of PET include, but are not limited to, phosphorous compounds, dyes, pigment, colorants, reheat agents, polydispersity modifiers, antioxidants and stabilizers (thermal, oxidative, UV, etc.), coupling or chain-extending agents, end-capping agents, telechelic modifiers, such as, for example metal co-ordinated sulfo-isophthalic acid, acetaldehyde reducing agents, acetaldehyde scavengers, buffers, agents to reduce formation of diethylene glycol (DEG), antistats, slip or anti-block agents, barrier modifiers, nucleators, titanium dioxide and other fillers/opacifiers, anti-fogging agents, optical brighteners, etc. The introduction of such co-monomers, catalyst(s), and/or additives is typically at various points in the PET manufacturing process separate from the addition of TPA. However, it can be advantageous to introduce certain additives with the TPA, i.e. prior to the PET manufacturing process, especially co-monomers, such as, isophthalic acid and dyes or colorants which are thermally stable. Thus, co-monomers, catalyst(s), and additives can be introduced and intimately mixed with the TPA<br>
during theTPA manufacturing process rather than during the PET manufacturing process. Specific TPA manufacturing steps in which the intimate introduction of additive(s) can be achieved include addition at the solid liquid separation device for isolating the TPA cake, at any drying equipment, at or in any conveyance line or process pipeline, and prior to shipping the TPA product in any container. Thus, the TPA product in any form, whether dry solids (with residual water or acetic acid), wet cake (with some liquid water, or methanoi, or EG, or some other diol or co-monomer, or mixtures), wet paste (with some liquid water, or methanol, or EG, or some other diol or co-monomer, or mixtures), or slurry (with water, or methanol, or EG, or some other diol or co-monomer, or mixtures), can be enriched prior to use in PET manufacture<br>
In addition, Figure 9 depicts that the enrichment feed 220 can be introduced and enrichment can occur at any point from the crystallized slurry composition 160 to the dried carboxylic acid composition 280.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is provided in Figure 10. The enrichment process can be conducted on a carboxylic acid composition 214 in an extended enrichment zone 213 to produce an enriched carboxylic acid composition 216. The enrichment feed 220 can comprise any composition previously or subsequently disclosed. There are no limitations on the carboxylic acid composition other than the carboxylic acid composition 214 comprises a carboxylic acid, optional solvent, and optionally a catalyst. In another embodiment of the invention the carboxylic acid composition can be used to produce the dried carboxylic acid composition 280.<br>
It should also be pointed out that in another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment zone 210 and the catalyst removal zone 180 can be combined into one zone comprising at least one device that accomplishes both functions as shown in Figure 11.<br>
There are no special limitations for the enrichment feed 220 other than it has a composition suitable to enrich the post catalyst removal composition 200. For example, the enrichment feed 220 can be a solid,<br>
a wash, a slurry, a paste, solids, solution or gas entrained liquid or solid. In an embodiment of the invention, the enrichment feed 220 comprises compositions capable of making the dried carboxylic acid cake composition 280. In another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment feed 220 are only solids and are added at one point or throughout the process to produce the dried carboxylic acid cake composition 280.<br>
Figures 12,13, 14 and 15 illustrate one embodiment of the invention showing how an enrichment feed 220 can be obtained and how the enrichment feed 220 is utilized through the process. In Figures 12,13,14, and 15, the enrichment feed(s) are depicted as stream 220. This is to illustrate that the enrichment feed(s) 220 can be taken from a variety of sources or one source and the enrichment feed(s) can have a variety of different compositions, different physical forms, and different addition points in the process. Also, the enrichment feed 220 can be added at one time, intermittently, or gradually throughout the process.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates one embodiment of the invention on how an enrichment feed 220 can be obtained. At least a portion of the catalyst rich liquor 185 is fed to a cooling and/or concentration zone 300 to generate a concentrated mother liquor stream 310 and a solvent stream 311. Sufficient solvent removal in the cooling and/or concentration zone 300 is achieved such that the concentrated catalyst rich stream 310 can have a % solids ranging from 10% by weight to 45% by weight.<br>
A portion of the concentrated mother liquor stream 310 and an extraction solvent stream 323 is fed to an extraction zone 320 to generate a catalyst rich stream 324 and a catalyst depleted stream 350. The balance of the concentrated mother liquor stream 310 and a wash stream 331 is fed to a solid-liquid separation zone(SLS Zone), generating a wet cake stream 340 and wash liquor stream 332, comprising mother liquor and wash liquor. The wet cake stream 340 can be used as an enrichment feed 220 and a portion of the wet cake stream 340 can be sent to the product filter or product dryer to enrich the<br>
product stream with at least a portion of the contents of the wet cake stream 340. Alternatively, a portion of the wet cake stream 340 and a portion of catalyst depleted stream 350 can be fed to an optional mix zone where the two streams are mixed forming an enrichment feed 220 and a portion of this stream can be sent to a product filter or product dryer to enrich the product stream with at least a portion of the contents of enrichment feed 220.<br>
The extraction zone 320 comprises at least one extractor. The extraction solvent 323 used in the extractor should be substantially water-insoluble to minimize the amount of organic solvent dissolved in the aqueous fraction. Additionally, the extraction solvent 323 is preferably an azeotropic agent which serves to assist solvent recovery from the organic extract. Solvents which have proven to be particularly useful are C1 to C6 alkyl acetates, particularly n-propyl acetate (n-PA), isopropyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, sec-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate, although other water-insoluble organic solvents having an appropriate density and a sufficiently low boiling point may also be used, such as p-xylene. N-propyl acetate and isopropyl acetate are particularly preferred due to their relatively low water solubility, excellent azeotropic behavior, and their ability to remove the remaining acetic acid as well as high-boiling organic impurities from the aqueous mixture.<br>
The extraction can be effected using solvent ratios from about 1to about 4 parts by weight solvent per part of extractor feed depending on the extractor feed composition. Space velocities of the combined feeds to the extractor generally range from 1 to about 3 hr"1. Although the extraction can be done at ambient temperature and pressure, heating the solvent and extractor to about 30°C to about 70°C, or about 40°C to about 60°C, can be used.<br>
Figures 12,13, and 14 illustrate one embodiment of the invention showing how an enrichment feed 220 can be utilized throughout the process. Aromatic feed stock 10 comprising reactants and catalyst are fed to the primary oxidation zone 20 generating a crude carboxylic acid composition 30. The crude carboxylic acid composition 30 and a solvent<br>
stream 50 are fed to liquid displacement zone 40 to achieve a partial solvent swap exchanging a portion of the oxidation solvent present in stream 30 with pure solvent generating a displaced solvent stream 60 and a slurry composition stream 70. The slurry composition 70 and a gas stream containing oxygen 106 are fed to a staged oxidation zone 80 to generate a staged oxidation composition 110. The staged oxidation composition 110 and a solvent stream 101 are fed to a liquid displacement zone 100 to achieve a partial solvent swap exchanging a portion of the oxidation solvent present in the staged oxidation composition 110 with pure solvent generating a displaced solvent stream 102 and a post solvent swap staged oxidation composition 115.   The post solvent swap staged oxidation composition 115 is fed to a crystallization zone 120 generating a crystallized slurry composition Stream 160, an optional solvent vapor stream 121, and an optional liquid solvent stream 122. The crystallized slurry composition stream 160 and an optional enrichment feed 220 is fed to a cooling zone 165 where a cooled carboxylic acid composition stream 170 and an optional oxidation solvent stream 163 is generated. The cooled carboxylic acid composition 170, a wash feed 175, and an optional enrichment feed 220 are fed to a catalyst removal zone 180 to generate a post catalyst removal composition 200, the catalyst rich liquor 185, and a wash liquor 62, and a depleted enrichment feed 230. The post catalyst removal composition 200, swap solvent stream 201, and an optional enrichment fee 220 are fed to an optional solvent swap zone 205 to generate a swap solvent liquor 202, and post solvent swap composition 206. The post solvent swap composition 206 and an enrichment feed 220 are fed to an enrichment zone 210 to generate an enriched carboxylic acid composition Stream 240 and a depleted enrichment feed 230. The enriched composition 240 and an optional enrichment feed 220 are fed to an optional dewatering zone 250 to generate a dewatered carboxylic acid composition 260.<br>
The catalyst removal zone 180, solvent swap zone 205, enrichment zone 210, dewatering zone 250, and optionally the drying<br>
zone 270 can be achieved in a single solid liquid separation device, preferably a continuous pressure or vacuum filter, and most preferably a vacuum belt filter. A continuous pressure drum filter or a rotary vacuum drum filter can also be used. The dewatered enriched carboxylic acid composition 260, and an optional enrichment feed 220 are fed to an optional drying zone 270 to generate a dry enriched carboxylic acid composition 280 and a solvent vapor stream 275.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment feed 220 comprises water in a quantity greater than 50% by weight. In another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment feed 220 comprises water in a quantity greater than 75% by weight. In another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment feed 220 comprises water in a quantity greater than 95% by weight.

In another embodiment of the invention, the post catalyst removal composition 200 enters the enrichment zone 210 at a temperature in a range of about 200°C to the freezing point of the enrichment feed 220. In another embodiment of the invention, the post catalyst removal composition 200 enters the enrichment zone 210 at a temperature in a range of about 100°C to the freezing point of the enrichment feed 220. In another embodiment of the invention, the post catalyst removal composition 200 enters the enrichment zone 210 at a temperature in a range of about 200°C to about 0°C In another embodiment of the invention, the post catalyst removal composition 200 enters the enrichment zone 210 at a temperature in a range of about 0°C to 100°C. Other ranges are less than 100°C to 20°C; and 40°C to less than 100°C.<br>
The enrichment zone 210 comprises at least one device sufficient to provide a sufficient amount of contact time between the enrichment feed 220 and the post catalyst removal composition 200 to allow for at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzoic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, trimeliitic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid isomers, hydroxymethylbenzoic acid isomers, and toluic acid isomers to be enriched. In another embodiment of the invention, the enrichment zone 210 or extended enrichment zone 213 comprises a device that provides a sufficient amount of contact time between the enrichment feed and the post catalyst removal composition 200 or carboxylic acid composition 214 to allow monomers, co-monomers, additives, and other compounds useful in the production of polyesters to be enriched.

In another embodiment of the invention, the enriched composition 240 on a dry solids basis encompasses all possible combinations of compositions of the dried carboxylic acid composition 280 described subsequently in this disclosure. Dry solids basis will be described subsequently in this disclosure.<br>
All compositions are measured on a dry solids basis to be described subsequently in the disclosure. All measurements and claims in ppm are in ppm by weight on a dry solids basis.<br>
Step (h) comprises optionally dewatering the enriched composition 240 in a dewatering zone 250 to form a dewatered post catalyst removal composition 260.<br>
The dewatering can be conducted by any means know in the art. The dewatering results in the dewatered post catalyst removal composition 260 having a moisture content of less than 25 % by weight moisture. Other moisture content ranges are less than 15% by weight moisture or less than 10% by weight moisture or less than 5% by weight moisture. In yet another embodiment of the invention, dewatering can be accomplished through the use of mostly mechanical means for drying and wherein the majority of the drying is not accomplished through evaporation. Majority as used herein means greater than 50%.<br>
Step (i) comprises filtering and optionally drying the enriched composition 240 or the dewatered post catalyst removal composition 260 in a filtration and drying zone 270 to remove a portion of the solvent from the enriched composition 240 or the dewatered post catalyst removal composition 260 to produce the dried carboxylic acid composition 280.<br>
The enriched composition 240 or the dewatered post catalyst removal composition 260 is withdrawn from the enrichment zone 210 or the dewatering zone 250 and fed to a filtration and drying zone 270.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the filtration cake goes through an initial solvent removal step, is then rinsed with acid wash to remove residual catalyst, and then solvent is removed again before being sent to the dryers.<br>
The drying zone 270 comprises at least one dryer and can be accomplished by any means known in the art that is capable of evaporating at least 10% of the volatiles remaining in the filter cake to produce the dried carboxylic acid composition 280. For example, indirect contact dryers including a rotary steam tube dryer, a Single Shaft Porcupine® Processor dryer, and a Bepex Solidaire® Processor can be used for the drying to produce a dried carboxylic acid composition 280. Direct contact dryers including a fluid bed dryer and drying in a convey line can be used for drying to produce a dried carboxylic acid composition 280. In another embodiment of the invention, drying can be accomplished in a solid-liquid separation device like a vacuum belt filter or a rotary pressure drum filter by allowing a gas stream to flow through the filter cake thus removing volatiles. In another embodiment of the invention, a solid-liquid separation device can comprise any combination of the following zones: a catalyst removal zone, an enrichment zone, a dewatering zone, and a drying zone. A dried carboxylic acid composition can be a carboxylic acid composition with less than 5% moisture, preferably less than 2% moisture, and more preferably less than 1 % moisture, and even more preferably less than 0.5%, and yet more preferably less than 0.1%.<br>

In another embodiment of this invention, all the compositions of the dried carboxylic acid composition 280 previously stated further comprise a catalyst composition of less than 1000 ppm, or 500 ppm, or 250 ppm, or 100 ppm. Other ranges are less than 85 ppm, and less than 50 ppm. Yet another range is less than 25 ppm, or less than 15 ppm, or less than 10 ppm or less than 5 ppm.

All concentrations throughout the disclosure and claims are on a dry solids basis. The physical form of the TPA product can be a dry solid, wet cake, paste, or slurry. For the sake of consistency, any liquid present in the TPA product is ignored when describing its composition. The composition will be expressed as a weight percent or ppmw (part per million by weight) on a dry solids basis which assumes there is no moisture in the product. For example, 500 ppmw of p-toluic acid in a TPA product means there are 500 grams of p-toluic acid for every 1,000,000 grams of non-liquid mass in the product regardless of the actual physical form of the product. All measurements expressed in ppm are ppm by weight. Therefore, ppm is equivalent to ppmw throughout the disclosure.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, all the compositions previously stated are an average composition over a continuous period during steady state operation. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the compositions previously disclosed are the time average compositions obtained over a 7 day period, or 14 day period, or 30 day period during continuous operation. In another embodiment of the invention, the compositions previously disclosed could include any sample taken from a 1 metric ton lot (1,000 kg) or larger. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, the compositions previously disclosed could include any sample in a shipping container, or a shipping container containing at least 500 kg of the disclosed compositions.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the compositions of matter we have specified will be utilized to make PET which could be subsequently used in producing coatings, resins, fibers, film, sheet, containers, or other formed articles.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the compositions previously disclosed, can have functionalities in PET polymerization ranging from zero through at least three. Functional groups for polycondensation polymerization of polyesters and copolyesters, as well as polyamides, copolyamides, and other co-polycondensation polymers comprise reactive carboxyl and reactive hydroxyl groups. The following discussion will focus on the impact of various impurities or oxidation byproducts on the manufacture and properties of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as an example.<br>
Zero-functional impurities are either removed via purge processes in PET manufacture or end up as diluting species in the PET. Mono-and tri- functional species affect the rate of polymerization, possibly both in melt-phase and solid-stating, but usually more so in solid-stating due to the difficulty of obtaining high molecular weight especially with monofunctional, chain-terminating species present. Depending on the concentrations, mono- and tri- functional species also can affect the PET product properties via changing the PET polydispersity of molecular weight.<br>
For example, p-toluic acid (p-TA) is an impurity which is monofunctional in PET polymerization with PET process polymerization catalysts. In contrast, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) is monofuntional when used with an Sb (antimony) catalyst in PET polymerization, but can be di- or tri-functional when used with a Ti (titanium) catalyst in PET polymerization, due to the conversion of the aldehyde group to a hemi-acetal or an acetal. Trimellitic acid (1,2,4-benzene tricarboxylic acid, or TMA) is a tri-functional impurity. To a first approximation, mono- and tri-<br>
functional impurities have offsetting effects on PET polymerization. That is, increased amounts of mono-functional impurities, such as p-toluic acid, benzoic acid, monocarboxyfluorenones, bromo-benzoic acid, bromo-acetic acid, and 4-CBA (with Sb catalyst), can be compensated for via increased concentration of tri- or greater functional impurities, such as trimellitic acid, 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl, 2,5,4'-tricarboxybenzophenone, and 4-CBA (with Ti catalyst). Molar concentrations must be used and not weight-based concentrations when comparing the polymerization effects of impurities with functionality other than two, as well as the relative reactivity of reacting groups (primarily carboxyl functionality) when the functionality is greater than one. Fortunately, most of the impurities present in PTA in significant concentrations (more than a few ppmw) are bi-funotional and thus have no deleterious effects on PET polymerization due to their functionality and they have no deleterious effects on PET polymer properties due to their low concentration. In particular, assuming an Sb-catalyzed PET polymerization process, then each 1.0 ppmw of TMA will approximately offset approximately 0.60 ppmw benzoic acid (BA), or 0.65 ppmw p-TA, due to differences in molecular weight. If analytical information is known for PTA impurities, i.e. the concentrations of the impurities and their functionalities, then an estimate can be made of the relative overall effect on PET polymerization.<br>
Note that for I PA instead of TPA, the compounds will be 3-hydroxybenzoicacid, 3-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid, 3,3'-dicarboxybiphenyl, dicarboxyanthraquinone isomers, and 3,3'-dicarboxystilbene, etc. Similarly, for carboxylic acids, the compounds will be hydroxybenzoic acid isomers, hydroxymethylbenzoic acid isomers, dicarboxybiphenyl isomers, dicarboxyanthraquinone isomers, and dicarboxystilbene isomers, etc.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, a process for producing an enriched composition 240 is provided as shown in figures 20A and 20B. In this embodiment, as shown in Figures 20 a&amp;b, the catalyst removal zone 180 is optional and the enrichment zone 210 is required. All of the zones in Figures 20 A&amp;B have been previously been described in this disclosure. It should be appreciated that the process zones<br>
previously described can be utilized in any other logical order to produce the dried carboxylic acid composition 280. It should also be appreciated that when the process zones are reordered that the process conditions may change. It should also be appreciated that the process zones can be used independently.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, each embodiment can optionally include an additional step comprising decolorizing the carboxylic acid or an esterified carboxylic acid. Preferably the decolorizing is accomplished by hydrogenation. The decolorizing can occur at any location after the primary oxidation zone 20.<br>
The decolorizing of a carboxylic acid slurry or an esterified carboxylic acid can be accomplished by any means known in the art and is not limited to hydrogenation. However, for example in one embodiment of the invention, the decolorizing can be accomplished by reacting a carboxylic acid that has undergone esterification treatment, for example with ethylene glycol, with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst in a decolorizing reactor zone to produce a decolorized carboxylic acid solution or a decolorized ester product. For the decolorizing reactor zone, there are no special limitations in the form or construction thereof, subject to an arrangement that allows supply of hydrogen to effect intimate contact of the carboxylic acid or ester product with the catalyst in the decolorizing reactor zone. Typically, the hydrogenation catalyst is usually a single Group VIII metal or combination of Group VIII metals. Preferably, the hydrogenation catalyst is selected from a group consisting of palladium, ruthenium, rhodium and combination thereof.  The decolorizing reactor zone comprises a hydrogenation reactor that operates at a temperature and pressure sufficient to hydrogenate a portion of the characteristically yellow compounds to colorless derivatives.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, instead of utilizing the drying zone as preciously disclosed, the enriched composition 240 can be directly routed to an esterification zone 310 as shown in Figure 16. In this embodiment, the moisture content in the enriched composition 240<br>
is predominantly water and the weight % of acetic acid in the enriched composition 240 is less than 10%, preferably less than 2%, and most preferably less than 0.1%. "Predominantly" as used herein means greater than 85% of total moisture mass.<br>
Therefore, instead of drying, in an embodiment of the invention, step (i) comprises adding a diol in conduit 600 to the enriched composition 240 in an esterification reactor zone 610 to remove a portion of the moisture via conduit 620 to form a carboxylic acid and diol mixture in the esterification reactor zone 610. The carboxylic acid and diol react to form a hydroxyalkyester stream 630. The hydroxyalkyester stream 630 comprises a hydroxyalky ester compound.<br>
The diol in conduit 600 is introduced in such a manner as to displace the moisture as the dominant slurrying liquid. This can be accomplished by introducing a diol via conduit 600 as a saturated liquid in a temperature range of about 150°C to about 300°C. Preferably, the diol in conduit 600 is introduced as a saturated or superheated vapor in a temperature range of about 150°C to about 300°C in a form with sufficient enthalpy as to evaporate the water to exit via conduit 320. The diol in conduit 600 is selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tri-ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, other diols useful in making polyesters and copolyesters, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the diol in conduit 600 is ethylene glycol. Alternatively, an external heat source can be used to introduce sufficient enthalpy to vaporize the water, which exits via conduit 620.   The hydroxalkyl ester stream mixture exits via conduit stream 630.<br>
The esterification reactor zone 610 operates at a temperature of about 240°C higher. Preferably the esterification reactor zone 610 operates in a temperature range of about 260°C to about 280°C. The esterification reactor zone 610 operates at a pressure of about 40 psia to<br>
about 100 psia so as to effect esterification of the terephthalic acid and diol mixture to produce a hydroxyethyl ester of terephthalic acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, instead of utilizing the drying zone as preciously disclosed, the enriched composition 240 can be directly routed to a liquid exchange zone 500 as shown in figure 17. In this embodiment, the moisture content in the enriched composition 240 has a significant amount of solvent. "Significant amount" as used herein means greater than 1%, or greater than 2%, or greater than 5% or greater than 10% or greater than 15%.<br>
The enriched composition 240 is subjected to a wash or "rinsing" with exchange solvent in the liquid exchange zone 500, wherein a portion of the initial solvent is replaced with exchange solvent to form an exchange solvent enriched composition 246. The exchange solvent comprises water, methanol, ethylene glycol, and any diol or monomer compatible with polyester or copolyester manufacturing process. The exchange solvent enriched composition 246, is preferably in the range of 0.5-30% by weight moisture, more preferably in the range of about 1-20% by weight moisture, and most preferably in the range of 1-5% by weight moisture. The residual moisture of the exchange solvent enriched composition 206 could contain less than about 2% by weight solvent, another range is less than 5% or less than 10% by weight, or less than 20%.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, exchange solvent is introduced into the liquid exchange zone 500. The exchange solvent is preferably introduced on a continuous basis. There are no limitations on the temperature or pressure of the exchange solvent including the use of vaporized water, steam, or a combination of water and steam as wash. The liquid exchange zone 500 comprises at least one solid liquid separation device. The solid liquid separation device can typically be comprised of, but not limited to, the following types of devices: centrifuges, cyclones, rotary drum filters, belt filters, press filters, etc. The solid liquid separation device can operate within a temperature range of from about 5°C to 195CC. The liquid exchange zone and the<br>
catalyst removal zone can be within the same device, for example in a belt filter. The exchange solvent enriched composition 246 is subsequently sent to an esterification zone 610 which has been previously described.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
It is clear that retention of IPA varies with wash temperature and wash ratio allowing the control of the IPA content in the post catalyst removal composition stream 200. The range of IPA content in stream 200 in the experiments above varied from 146 ppm to 20 ppm depending upon the amount and temperature of wash. Retention of select oxidation byproducts can be controlled by the temperature, composition, and amount of wash feed Stream 175 applied in the catalyst removal zone 180. This data illustrates oxidation by-product retention in a catalyst removal zone utilizing IPA as an example. IPA is considered representative such that other oxidation by-products can exhibit similar retention behavior under specific wash temperature and wash ratio combinations.<br>

Samples from enriched carboxylic acid composition stream 240 were submitted to analytical for IPA analyses.<br>
Results<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
In experiment 1 the wet cake is not washed resulting in a concentration of 2199 ppm IPA. In experiments 2 and 3, the wet cake is wash with stream 175 producing a post catalyst composition 200 with an average IPA concentration of about 900 ppm.. In experiments 4 and 5 the post catalyst composition 200 is enriched with an enrichment stream 220 to produce an enriched carboxylic composition 240 with an average IPA concentration of about 5000 ppm. It is clear from this data that IPA was enriched in stream 240 to a concentration above that of the post catalyst composition. This data illustrates oxidation by-product enrichment in an enrichment zone utilizing IPA as an example. IPA is considered representative of other oxidation by-products in that the retention of other oxidation by-products in the catalyst removal zone can be influenced by the wash conditions, including the wash ratio, wash solvent composition, and wash temperature, as well as the cake thickness and the particle size distribution which affects the cake porosity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
