The invention relates to an apparatus for sewing stitch-group buttonholes of a<br>
longitudinal direction that runs lengthwise or crosswise of an edge of a work piece.<br>
DE 29 35 763 C2 (corresponding to U.S. patent 4 296 696) describes an apparatus of<br>
the generic type, in which a sewing machine is mounted on a base part. The sewing<br>
machine includes an arm that is arranged below the stitch formation zone and a base<br>
plate that is arranged above the stitch formation area. The sewing machine is disposed<br>
on a carrier in the form of a triangular frame which is pivotable about a vertical axis that<br>
aligns with the needle bar and the needle. The sewing machine supports itself on the<br>
carrier by means of a displaceable guide arrangement. This apparatus is complicated<br>
and not appropriate for table-top sewing machines. Constructing the pivot axis is<br>
accompanied with considerable requirements.<br>
It is an object of the invention to embody an apparatus of the generic type so that<br>
constructional requirements are reduced and handling is simplified.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the features disclosed hereunder.<br>
The sewing machine rests on a bearing plate which is again arranged on the<br>
table top pivotably about bearing-as a rule by approximately 90°. Requirements in terms<br>
of design and handling are extraordinarily low.<br>
Numerous advantageous embodiments will become apparent from further description.<br><br>
Details of the invention will become apparent from the ensuing description<br>
of an exemplary embodiment, taken in conjunction with the drawing, in<br>
which<br>
Fig. 1 is a lateral longitudinal view of the apparatus seen from the opera-<br>
tor's side;<br>
Fig. 2 is an elevation of the apparatus in accordance with the arrow II-II<br>
of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a horizontal section through the apparatus between the base plate<br>
of the sewing machine and the bearing plate on the line III-III of<br>
Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 is a vertical partial section through the apparatus on the line IV-IV<br>
of Fig. 3;<br>
Fig. 5 is a plan view of the apparatus in a first working position of the<br>
sewing machine in accordance with the arrow V of Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 6 is an illustration , corresponding to Fig. 5, showing a second work-<br>
ing position of the sewing machine.<br>
A C-shaped sewing machine 1 includes a top arm 2, a base plate 3 of the<br>
type of a casing and a standard 4 that unites the arm 2 and the base plate 3.<br>
Disposed in the arm 2 is an arm shaft 5 (roughly outlined) which is driv- able by a driving motor 6 (also roughly outlined). Conventionally, a needle<br>
bar 7 with a needle 8 is reciprocatingly driven by the arm shaft 5.<br><br>
The sewing machine 1 is arranged on a slab 9 of a table 10 which supports<br>
itself by a stand 11 on the ground 12. A sewing-machine-1 control unit 13<br>
is mounted on the stand 11; by way of a rod assembly 14 it is linked to a<br>
pedal 15. The pedal 15 can be actuated by an operator (not shown) from the<br>
operator's side 16.<br>
The sewing machine 1 rests by its base plate 3 on a bearing plate 17, to<br>
which it is joined by a hinge 18, the rod-type bearing axis 19 of which runs<br>
approximately parallel to the arm shaft 5 i.e., in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the sewing machine 1. The bearing axis 19 horizontally adjoins the<br>
lengthwise rear 20 of the sewing machine 1 and the bottom side 21 of the<br>
base plate 3 by which it rests on the bearing plate 17. The hinge 18 is<br>
formed by two bearing blocks 22 that are tightly joined to the bearing plate<br>
17 and by the bearing axis 19 that is lodged therein. The sewing machine 1<br>
can be tilted about the bearing axis 19 of the hinge 18, with its lengthwise<br>
rear 20 tipping over towards the slab 9.<br>
The bearing plate 17 is provided on its bottom side with a silencing and<br>
vibration-absorbent coating 23 of felt, by which it rests on the slab 9. To-<br>
gether with the sewing machine 1, the bearing plate 17 is displaceable on<br>
the slab 9. By means of a pivot bearing 24, the bearing plate 17 is mounted<br>
to be pivotable relative to the slab 9 about a vertical axis 25 i.e., about an<br>
axis 25 that is perpendicular to the slab 9. The pivot bearing 24 substan-<br>
tially comprises a tubular, hollow bearing journal 26 which is tightly joined<br>
to the bearing plate 17 by an annular flange 27 which is formed on the<br>
bearing journal 26 and by a nut 27a that is screwed thereon; the bearing<br>
journal 26 is lodged in a hole 28 of the slab 9. The bearing journal 26 is not<br>
secured on the bottom side 29 of the slab 9 i.e., it is merely inserted from<br><br>
above into the hole 28. The bearing plate 17 and the sewing machine 1 are<br>
secured on the slab 9 solely by their weight.<br>
However, it is just as well possible to provide a securing ring on the bottom<br>
end of the bearing journal 26 i.e., underneath the bottom side 29 of the slab<br>
9, so that positive fit is ensured between the sewing machine 1 and the ta-<br>
ble 10, in particular for conveyance of the apparatus in the direction of the<br>
axis 25.<br>
The bearing journal 26 consists of plastic material and serves as a pas-<br>
sageway, protected against wear, for pneumatic and/or electric lines 30 that<br>
lead through the bearing journal 26. Lines 30 of this type connect the con-<br>
trol unit 13 to the sewing machine 1, mouthing into the base plate 3<br>
thereof.<br>
A detent 31 serves to arrest the bearing plate 17 on the slab 9 in two work-<br>
ing positions that are turned by a right angle one relative to the other. As<br>
seen in Fig. 3, the sewing machine 1 can thus be fixed in two working posi-<br>
tions relative to the operator's side 16, with its lengthwise front 32, in a first<br>
working position (shown in solid lines in Fig. 3), facing the operator's side<br>
16 while, in a second working position (dashed in Fig. 3), the sewing-<br>
machine-1 frontal end 33 that adjoins the needle bar 7 with the needle 8 is<br>
turned towards the operator's side 16. The detent 31 is substantially com-<br>
prised of a bolt 34 which reaches through a corresponding hole 35 in the<br>
bearing plate 17 and is alternately insertable into one of two holes 36 in the<br>
slab 9 that are allocated to the two working positions mentioned. The bolt<br>
34 may have a thread. It has a handle head 37 on its upper end.<br><br>
On the lengthwise front 32, a control panel 38 is articulated to the arm 2 for<br>
pivoting about a pivot joint 39 that has a vertical axis 40 and is disposed on<br>
the side, turned towards the needle bar 7, of the control panel 38.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the two fields of application of the sewing machine.<br>
A work piece 41 is provided with sewing patterns comprised of stitch<br>
groups, for example button holes or stay stitches, several of which are sewn<br>
at a distance from each other.<br>
In the case of a sewing-machine-1 arrangement according to Fig. 5, button-<br>
holes 42, which are lined up in a row, are sewn one after the other with<br>
their lengthwise direction parallel to the operator's side 16 and to the edge<br>
43 of the work piece 41. The buttonholes 42 are oriented longitudinally and<br>
lined up successively. For each individual buttonhole 42 to be sewn, the<br>
work piece 41 is held and guided on the base plate 3 by means of a work-<br>
piece holder 44. After each buttonhole-42 sewing job, work-piece feed<br>
takes place parallel to the lengthwise front 32 and parallel to the operator's<br>
side 16 in the work-piece-feed direction 45. The lengthwise front 32 of the<br>
sewing machine 1 is turned towards the operator's side 16. The control<br>
panel 38 is folded down on the arm 2 for visibility and operability from the<br>
operator's side 16.<br>
In the mode of operation seen in Fig. 6, the frontal end 33 of the sewing<br>
machine 1 is turned towards the operator's side 16; the sewing machine 1,<br>
inclusive of the bearing plate 17, is rotated by 90° as compared to the<br>
working position seen in Fig. 5 and, in this position, locked in place on the<br>
slab 9. Buttonholes 47 are sewn in the work piece 46, which are arranged<br>
crosswise of the work-piece-feed direction 49 and consequently crosswise<br>
of the edge 48 of the work piece 46. They line up successively in a row,<br><br>
however with their longitudinal direction crosswise of the work-piece-feed<br>
direction 49. The longitudinal direction of each buttonhole 47 is parallel to<br>
the lengthwise front 32 of the sewing machine 1 i.e., the sewing job itself<br>
on the sewing machine 1 takes place in the same way as with the mode of<br>
operation according to Fig. 5. For visibility and operability of the control<br>
panel 38 from the operator's side 16, the control panel 38 is pivoted in a<br>
direction towards the needle bar 7 into a position turned by 90° as com-<br>
pared to Fig. 5; in this position, the control panel 38 stands out from the<br>
sewing machine 1 crosswise of the lengthwise front 32.<br>
As the operator's side 16 finds itself without modification relative to the<br>
table 12 and the pedal 15, there is no need of modifying the pedal 15. The<br>
position of the pivot bearing 24 and the axis 25 is selected such that, in<br>
both working positions of the sewing machine 1 seen in Figs. 5 and 6, an<br>
operator may conveniently keep his place in front of the sewing machine 1<br>
and the table 10. Suitably, the pivot bearing 24 is also in the proximity of<br>
the needle-bar axis, which can easily be put into practice in the specified<br>
design.<br><br>
