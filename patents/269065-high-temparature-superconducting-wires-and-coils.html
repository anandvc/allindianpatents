[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(e) of U.S.<br>
Provisional Patent Application No. 60/703,815, filed on July 29, 2005, entitled<br>
"High Temperature Superconducting Wires and Coils," which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0002] This application is related to co-pending U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/193,262, filed on July 29, 2005, and entitled "Architecture For High<br>
Temperature Superconductor Wire," the entire contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference:<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0003] The present invention relates generally to high temperature<br>
superconducting wires. In particular, the invention relates to coated conductors,<br>
also called second generation, high temperature superconductor wires or tapes.<br>
The present invention also relates to superconducting structures that can maintain<br>
a constant current in varying magnetic field orientations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0004] Since the discovery of high-temperature superconducting (HTS)<br>
materials (superconducting above the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K) there<br>
have been efforts to develop various engineering applications using such HTS<br>
materials. In thin film superconductor devices and wires, the most progress has<br>
been made with fabrication of devices utilizing an oxide superconductor including<br>
yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen in the well-known basic composition of<br>
YBa2Cu307-x (hereinafter referred to as Y123). Progress has also been made with<br>
compositions containing rare earth elements ("RE") partially substituted for Y.<br>
Biaxially textured superconducting metal oxides, such as Y123, have achieved<br>
high critical current densities in a coated conductor architecture. These wires,<br>
often referred to as second generation HTS wires, are the preferred material for<br><br>
many applications, including cables, motors, generators, synchronous<br>
condensers, transformers, current limiters, and magnet systems for military, high<br>
energy physics, materials processing, transportation and medical uses.<br>
[0005] The current carrying capability of the HTS material is strongly related to<br>
its crystalline alignment or texture. The oxide superconductor grains typically are<br>
aligned with their c axis perpendicular to the plane of the wire surface and the ab<br>
plane parallel to the wire surface. Grain boundaries formed by the misalignment<br>
of neighboring crystalline HTS grains are known to form an obstacle to<br>
superconducting current flow, but this obstacle decreases with the increasing<br>
degree of alignment or texture. Therefore to make the material into a<br>
commercially viable product, e.g. an HTS wire, the HTS material must maintain a<br>
high degree of crystalline alignment or texture over relatively long distances.<br>
Otherwise, the superconducting current carrying capacity (critical current density)<br>
will be limited.<br>
[0006] HTS materials can be fabricated with a high degree of crystallographic<br>
alignment or texture over large areas by growing a thin layer of the material<br>
epitaxially on top of a flexible tape-shaped substrate, fabricated so that it has a<br>
high degree of crystallographic texture at its surface. When the crystalline HTS<br>
material is grown epitaxially on this surface, the crystal alignment of the HTS<br>
material grows to match the texture of the substrate. In other words, the substrate<br>
texture provides a template for the epitaxial growth of the crystalline HTS material.<br>
Further, the substrate provides structural integrity to the HTS layer.<br>
[0007] A substrate can be textured to provide a template that yields an<br>
epitaxial HTS layer. Materials such as nickel, copper, silver, iron, silver alloys,<br>
nickel alloys, iron alloys, stainless steel alloys, and copper alloys can be used,<br>
among others. The substrate can be textured using a deformation process, such<br>
as one involving rolling and recrystallization annealing the substrate. An example<br>
of such a process is the rolling-assisted biaxially textured substrate (RABiTS)<br>
process. In this case large quantities of metal can be processed economically by<br>
deformation processing and annealing and can achieve a high degree of texture.<br><br>
[0008] One or more buffer layers can be deposited or grown on the substrate<br>
surface with suitable crystallographic template on which to grow the HTS material.<br>
Buffer layers also can provide the additional benefit of preventing diffusion of<br>
atoms from the substrate material into the crystalline lattice of the HTS material or<br>
of oxygen into the substrate material. This diffusion, or "poisoning," can disrupt<br>
the crystalline alignment and thereby degrade the electrical properties of the HTS<br>
material. Buffer layers also can provide enhanced adhesion between the<br>
substrate and the HTS layer. Moreover, the buffer layer(s) can have a coefficient<br>
of thermal expansion that is well matched to that of the superconductor material.<br>
For implementation of the technology in commercial applications, where the wire<br>
may be subjected to stress, this feature is desirable because it can help prevent<br>
delamination of the HTS layer from the substrate.<br>
[0009] Alternatively, a non-textured substrate such as Hastelloy can be used,<br>
and textured buffer layers deposited by means such as the ion-beam-assisted<br>
deposition (IBAD) or inclined substrate deposition (ISD). Additional buffer layers<br>
may be optionally deposited epitaxially on the IBAD or ISD layer to provide the<br>
final template for epitaxial deposition of an HTS layer.<br>
[0010] By using a suitable combination of a substrate and one or more buffer<br>
layers as a template, an HTS layer can be grown epitaxially with excellent crystal<br>
alignment or texture, also having good adhesion to the template surface, and with<br>
a sufficient barrier to poisoning by atoms from the substrate. The HTS layer can<br>
be deposited by any of a variety of methods, including the metal-organic<br>
deposition (MOD) process, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),<br>
pulsed laser deposition (PLD), thermal or e-beam evaporation, or other<br>
appropriate methods. Lastly, a cap layer can be added to the multilayer<br>
assembly, which helps prevent contamination of and damage to the HTS layer<br>
from above. The cap layer can be, e.g., silver, and can be, e.g., sputtered onto<br>
the HTS layer.<br>
[0011] HTS wire development continues to seek improvements in critical<br>
current density, in particular, critical current density in high magnetic fields and<br><br>
temperatures (JC(H,T)). This improvement can come by improving the "pinning" of<br>
the superconducting vortices, which is the underlying mechanism for high critical<br>
current density Jc in HTS materials. To achieve pinning in superconductors, local<br>
potential energy differences should be matched in size as closely as possible to<br>
the size of the normal core of the superconducting flux line or vortex. The cross-<br>
sectional core has a size on the order of the coherence length, which is several<br>
nanometers in high temperature superconducting cuprates and grows with<br>
temperature. Thus, nanometer-sized defects are introduced into the oxide<br>
superconductor grains to pin flux lines and improve current carrying properties in a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
[0012] The current carrying properties of crystallographically aligned layers of<br>
oxide superconductor are dependent on magnetic field orientation. Figure 1<br>
shows the typical field dependence of a metal-organic deposited (MOD) Y123 film<br>
on an oxide-buffered metal substrate with magnetic field oriented parallel and<br>
perpendicular to the planar face of the film. At both 27K and 75K, with the<br>
magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the planar face of the film, there is a<br>
significant decrease in Ic from the value in parallel orientation, limiting the<br>
usefulness of the Y123 wires in many coil applications. Many anticipated<br>
applications are planned for temperatures in the 55 to 65K region, in magnetic<br>
fields of 1 - 3 Tesla oriented perpendicular to the planar face of the film, which are<br>
conditions at which performance drops significantly. In addition to the parallel and<br>
perpendicular performance of the Y123 wires in magnetic field, it is important to<br>
examine the field performance at intermediate angles as shown in Figure 2. As<br>
seen in Figure 2, Y123 films typically show a small peak in the c-axis (0ยฐ and 180ยฐ<br>
or perpendicular to the planar face of the Y123 film), which can be enhanced<br>
through the presence of extended planar or linear defects (e.g., twin boundaries,<br>
grain boundaries, a-axis grains).<br>
[0013] in many applications, e.g., motors and magnetic coils, HTS wires .will<br>
experience local variations in the magnetic field orientation, so that the magnetic<br>
field experienced in one region of the wire can be quite different from the magnetic<br>
field experienced in another wire reaion. In such annlinatinns thp Vion wiro<br><br>
performance is determined by the minimum performance at any magnetic field<br>
orientation, and not solely by that at the perpendicular orientation. Thus, the HTS<br>
wire demonstrates reductions in current density in regions where the magnetic<br>
field deviates from an optimum orientation.<br>
Summary<br>
[0014] High temperature superconducting (HTS) wires are described, which<br>
may be used in applications and devices experiencing different magnetic field<br>
orientations at different locations within the wire or device. The HTS wires contain<br>
at least two superconducting layers, each of which is selected for its performance<br>
at a particular magnetic field orientation. By selecting a combination of<br>
superconducting layers, the HTS wire exhibits optimum performance in magnetic<br>
fields oriented parallel to the wire surface (H//ab) or, perpendicular to the wire<br>
surface (H//c), or at intermediate orientations.<br>
[0015] In one aspect of the invention, a superconducting wire, includes at least<br>
first and second superconducting layers disposed on one or more substrates in<br>
stacked relationship. The first superconducting layer includes a first high<br>
temperature superconducting oxide selected to provide a first predetermined ratio<br>
of critical current parallel to the surface of the superconductor layer to critical<br>
current perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor layer (lc(ab)/lc(c)), and<br>
the second superconducting layer includes a second high temperature<br>
superconducting layer selected to provide a second predetermined ratio of critical<br>
current parallel to the surface of the superconductor layer to critical current<br>
perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor layer (!c(ab)/!c(c)}. The first<br>
and second superconductor layers, in combination, provide a predetermined<br>
overall critical current ic in a selected magnetic field orientation.<br>
[0016] In one or more embodiments, the first or the second high temperature<br>
supei conductor is selected to provide enhanced critical current (lc(c)) in the<br>
presence of magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to surface of the<br>
superconducting layer (H//c). The first predetermined ratio for lc(ab)/lc(c) is less<br><br>
than or equal to 2.6, is less than 2.0, or less than 1.5, in an applied magnetic field<br>
of 1 Tesla or greater, e.g., in the range of about 1 Tesla to about 6 Tesla.<br>
[0017] In one or more embodiments, the high temperature superconductor<br>
includes a rare earth-alkaline earth-copper oxide including two or more rare earth<br>
elements, e.g., one or more of erbium and holmium. Holmium and/or erbium are<br>
present in an amount in the range of 25% to 150% of the stoichiometric amount of<br>
rare earth in rare earth-alkaline earth-copper oxide.<br>
[0018] In one or more embodiments, the high temperature superconductor<br>
includes a rare earth-alkaline earth-copper oxide and at least one second phase<br>
nanoparticle comprising a metal-containing compound located within a grain of the<br>
oxide superconductor.<br>
[0019] In one or more embodiments, the first or the second high temperature<br>
superconductor composition is selected to provide enhanced critical current (Ic) in<br>
the presence of magnetic fields oriented parallel to surface of the superconducting<br>
layer (H//ab). The second predetermined ratio for lc(ab)/lc(c) is greater than 2.5,<br>
or greater than 3.5, or greater than 5.5, in an applied magnetic field of 1 Tesla or<br>
greater, e.g., in the range of about 1 Tesla to about 6 Tesla.<br>
[0020] In one or more embodiments, the high temperature superconductor<br>
includes a rare earth-alkaline earth-copper oxide, wherein the copper to alkaline<br>
earth ratio is greater than 1.5.<br>
[0021] In one or more embodiments, the thicknesses of the first and second<br>
superconductor layers are different, lire thickness of the first and second<br>
superconductor layers are selected to provide a predetermined overall critical<br>
current in a selected magnetic field orientation. Additional layers that enhance<br>
critical current density in magnetic fields either parallel or perpendicular to the<br>
surface of the superconductor layer maybe included.<br>
[0022] In one or more embodiments, the selected magnetic field orientation is<br>
between 0ยฐ (H//c) and 90ยฐ (H//ab).<br><br>
[0023] In one or more embodiments, the superconductor wire includes a first<br>
coated element. The first coated element, includes a first substrate, at least one<br>
first buffer layer disposed on the first substrate and supporting the first<br>
superconducting layer, and a first metallic protective layer disposed on the first<br>
superconductor layer. The second coated element includes a second substrate,<br>
at least one second buffer layer disposed on the second substrate and supporting<br>
the second superconducting layer, and a second metallic protective layer<br>
disposed on the second superconductor layer.<br>
[0024] In one or more embodiments, the superconducting wire also includes ar<br>
intervening binder layer disposed between the first and second coated elements<br>
such that the first and second coated elements are joined at the first and second<br>
substrates, or an intervening binder layer disposed between the first and second<br>
coated elements such that the first and second coated elements are joined at the<br>
first and second metallic protective layers.<br>
[0025] Another aspect of the invention involves a method of making a high<br>
temperature superconducting device. The method includes providing a length of<br>
superconducting wire comprising a first region comprising a high lc(c) high<br>
temperature superconductor composition, a second region comprising of a high<br>
lc(ab) high temperature superconductor composition, and a third region<br>
comprising a mixture of the high lc(c) high temperature superconductor<br>
composition and the high lc(ab) high temperature superconductor composition,<br>
and arranging the length of superconductor in the device such that the first region<br>
occupies a location in the device experiencing a magnetic field orientation<br>
perpendicular (0ยฐ) to the high temperature wire, the second region occupies a<br>
location in the device experiencing a magnetic field orientation parallel (90ยฐ) to the<br>
high temperature wire, and the third region occupies a location in the device<br>
experiencing a magnetic field orientation between 0ยฐ and 90ยฐ,<br>
[0026] In one or more embodiments, the device is a coil; the first region of the<br>
high temperature superconductor wire is positioned at the ends of the coil; the<br>
second region of the high temperature superconductor wire is positioned in the<br><br>
interior of the coil; and the third region of the high temperature superconductor<br>
wire is positioned between the first and second regions.<br>
[0027] In another aspect of the invention, an article includes a superconducting<br>
wire comprising a high temperature superconductor layer, wherein the article<br>
experiences a magnetic field of differing orientation at different locations in the<br>
article, and wherein the composition of the high temperature superconductor layer<br>
is varied along its length to accommodate the orientation of the magnetic field in a<br>
given location.<br>
[0028] In one or more embodiments, the article is a coil and, in operation, the<br>
coil experiences induced magnetic fields that range from substantially parallel to<br>
the plane of the superconductor layer to substantial perpendicular to the ptene of<br>
the superconductor layer.<br>
[0029] In one or more embodiments, the composition of the superconductor<br>
wire is primarily a high lc(c) high temperature superconductor composition in a<br>
first region ofthe coil that experiences magnetic fields perpendicular to surface of<br>
the superconducting layer during operation; the composition of the<br>
superconductor wire comprises primarily a high lc(ab) high temperature<br>
superconductor composition in a second region of the coil that experiences<br>
magnetic fields that are substantially parallel to surface of the superconducting<br>
layer during operation; and the composition of the superconductor wire comprises<br>
a mixture of a high lc(c) high temperature superconductor composition and a high<br>
lc(ab) high temperature superconductor composition in a region of the coil that<br>
experiences magnetic fields that are at an angle of between 0 and 90 degrees to<br>
surface of the superconducting layer during operation.<br>
[0030] The selection of superconductor layers with different current carrying<br>
performances in different magnetic fields alters the Ic anisotropy along H//ab and<br>
Wile directions. In particular, Ic and hence Jc, are increased along H/7c without<br>
reducing the Ic capacity along H//ab.<br><br>
[0031] By "stacked relationship" it is meant that the elements are arranged in a<br>
stack, e.g., in overlaying relationship to one another wherein the layers may be in<br>
contact or they may have one or more intervening layers between them. No<br>
stacking order is suggested or implied.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0045] Figure 3 shows a two-dimensional plot of the magnetic field distribution<br>
ctiound ihe end turns 300 of a solenoid electromagnet 310, which demonstrates<br>
that both the field strength (H) (designated in arrows of different colors, where the<br>
colors correspond to the field strengths shown in the side bar of Figure 3) and field<br>
orientation (0.) (designated by arrow orientation) vary dramatically at different<br>
locations in the coil. An HTS wire that is optimized for electrical current carrying<br>
properties in a particular magnetic field will exhibit different currents (Ic), and<br>
hence different current densities (Jc), in different regions of the coil as each region<br>
of the coil experiences a maanetic field of different orientation. The oerformance<br><br>
of the coil is limited by the minimum performance of the wire. Thus, the overall<br>
current of the wire is reduced throughout and the wire functions at only a fraction<br>
of its current capacity over long lengths of the wire. If the current capacity can be<br>
increased for those underperforming regions of the wire, the current of the entire<br>
wire as a whole can be improved.<br>
[Q046J RE123 superconducting oxide grains typically exhibit strong anisotropy<br>
in a magnetic field, with the current in a magnetic field oriented in the (ab) plane of<br>
the oxide grain (along the surface of an epitaxial HTS layer) being much higher<br>
than the current in a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the HTS layer.<br>
Ic(ab) can be two times, three times, and even more than ten times greater than<br>
lc(c); and the anisotropy becomes more noted at higher magnetic field strength.<br>
While certain HTS materials have been observed to reduce magnetic field<br>
anisotropy, improvements in lc(c) are typically obtained at the expense of lc{ab).<br>
[0047] In one aspect of the invention, an HTS wire operates at higher<br>
percentage of the total current capacity than a conventional HTS wire. In one or<br>
more embodiments, the HTS wire operates at near full current load. Current<br>
carrying characteristics are improved by using HTS materials with different<br>
performance characteristics in different regions of an I ITS wire or device. The<br>
HTS material is selected for optimal performance in the anticipated local magnetic<br>
field orientation. Thus, by way of example, an HTS wire includes two<br>
superconducting layers that are selected to provide optimal performance in the<br>
local applied magnetic field. The two layers may be arranged or stacked in any<br>
order. In regions where the HTS wire experiences an applied magnetic field<br>
oriented parallel to the plane of the superconductor layer (H//ab or 0=90ยฐ), both<br>
layers may contain a superconductor layer having a composition and structure<br>
that provides optimal current along H//ab, that is, lc(ab)ยปlc(c). In regions where<br>
the HTS wire experiences an applied magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the<br>
plane of the superconductor layer (H//c or 0-0ยฐ),- both layers may contain a<br>
superconductor layer having a composition and structure that provides optimal<br>
current along H//c, that is, the Ic anisotropy is reduced to a desired level. In<br>
reaions where the HTS wire pynerienrps an annlipd mpnnptir fiplH whncp<br><br>
orientation is intermediate to H//ab and H//c, a first layer may contain a<br>
superconductor layer having a composition and structure that provides optimal<br>
current performance along H//ab, and a second layer may contain a<br>
superconductor layer having a composition and structure that.provides optimal<br>
current along H//c. The relative thickness of the two layers is selected to provide<br>
the desired balance of lc(c) and lc(ab) performance. The HTS wires provide an<br>
overall critical current of a desired performance, e.g., a desired current load.<br>
[0048] In one or more embodiments, the HTS wire carries an overall lc(c) in at<br>
least a portion of its length of at least 80A/cm-width; and lc(ab)/ lc(c) is greater<br>
than 2.0, or about 2-3; or lc(c) is about 120-150 A/cm-width and lc(ab)/ lc(c) is<br>
greater than 2.0 or about 2-3; or lc(c) is about 150-180 A/cm-width and lc(ab)/<br>
lc(c) is greater than 2.0, or about 2-3. The overall lc(c) is attained by the additive<br>
current performance of the two superconducting layers. Specifying a high lc(c)<br>
ensures that at least one of the layers performs well in a perpendicular magnetic<br>
field. Specifying that lc(ab) be a multiple of lc(c) of 2 or more ensures that current<br>
in a parallel field is even higher. The overall current performance may be attained<br>
in a variety of combinations, such as combining two wires having moderate lc(c)<br>
and moderate lc(ab). Alternatively, a wire of superior lc(c) can be combined with<br>
a wire of poor lc(c), but good lc(ab).<br>
[0049] In addition to providing the desired combination of high lc(ab)<br>
superconductor layers and high lc(c) superconductor layers, the two layer HTS<br>
wires increase critical current density over comparable single layer<br>
superconductor wires by substantially doubling the volume of superconductor<br>
material in the HTS wire.<br>
[0050] In one or more embodiments, the superconducting layers may be<br>
coated on the same side of the substrate. Figure 4A illustrates a double layer<br>
HTS wire 400 in which one-superconducting layer having optimal lc(ab) 440 and<br>
one superconducting layer having optimal lc(c) 470 are coated on the same side<br>
of the substrate 460. It should be noted that in this and all subsequent figures, the<br>
dimensions are not to scale. The substrate may be a textured metal substrate or<br><br>
a metal substrate that includes a textured substrate and is generally of a thickness<br>
in the range of about 0.05 - 0.2 mm. A metal substrate, such as Ni, Ag, or Ni<br>
alloys (e.g., NiW or other Hastalloy metals) provides flexibility for the wire and can<br>
be fabricated over long lengths and large areas. The superconducting layer<br>
comprises a material that is selected for its good performance in either H//ab or<br>
H//c. In addition, the superconductor layer is crystallographically aligned so that<br>
- the ab-plane of the oxide superconductor is parallel to the wire surface. Each<br>
superconducting layer is generally in the range of about 0.5 urn to about 2.0 pm,<br>
and may be even greater. An HTS wire as illustrated in Figure 4A is typically<br>
useful in a wire or region of a wire experiencing a magnetic field of intermediate<br>
orientation, that is, 0ยฐ 
[0051] In regions of the wire where 0 is about 0ยฐ, a double layer HTS wire 410<br>
in which two superconducting layers 470 having optimal lc(c) are coated on the<br>
same side of the substrate 460 may be used, as Figure 4B illustrates. Figure 4C<br>
illustrates a double layer HTS wire 420 in which two superconducting layers<br>
having optimal lc(ab) 420 are coated on the same side of the substrate 460. The<br>
HTS layer demonstrates an optimal performance in H//ab. In order to provide a<br>
wire having optimal performance in a device experiencing different magnetic field<br>
orientations, a wire may include any one-of these architectures at different<br>
locations in the device corresponding to different field orientations.<br>
[0052] In one or more embodiments, a conducting or insulating layer 490 may<br>
be disposed between the first and second superconductor layers as illustrated for<br>
HTS wire 430 in Figure 4D. Conductor layers provide electrical connection<br>
between the two layers and can be, tor example, copper, and silver. Exemplary<br>
insulating layers include "metal oxides such as-Y203, CuO and Ce02. Any<br>
interlayer should be structurally and chemically compatible with the HTS material<br>
and have, for example, a textured crystalline structure that permits the deposition<br>
of an epitaxial HTS layer. The interlayer thickness is generally in the range of 20<br>
nm to 200 nm, and is deposited, for example, by sputtering, evaporation<br>
deposition or pulsed vapor deposition, or other conventional methods.<br><br>
[0053] In one or more embodiments, the superconductor layers are coated on<br>
opposite sides of the substrate. Figure 5A illustrates a double layer HTS wire 520<br>
in which one superconducting layer having optimal lc(//ab) 440 and one<br>
superconducting layer having optimal lc(//c) 470 are coated on opposite sides of<br>
the substrate 460. Figure 5B illustrates a double layer HTS wire 510 in which two<br>
superconducting layers 470 having optimal lc(//c) are coated on opposite sides of<br>
the substrate 460. Figure 5C illustrates a doubio layer HTS wire 500 in whicrr two<br>
superconducting layers having optimal lc(//ab) 440 are coated on opposite sides<br>
of the substrate. Additional superconducting layers may be included on either<br>
side of the substrate and may enhance either lc(c) or ic(ab).<br>
[0054] The HTS wires illustrated in Figures 4A-4D and Figures 5A-5C and<br>
elsewhere in this description include one or more buffer layers {not shown)<br>
disposed between the substrate and superconductor layer and one or more cap<br>
layers (not shown) overlaying the superconductor. In one or more embodiments,<br>
the buffer layer is made up of an electrically insulating material, though electrically<br>
conductive materials also can be used. The buffer layer is made up of, e.g., an<br>
inert metal, an oxide, zirconate, titanate, niobate, nitride, tantalate, aluminate,<br>
cuprate, manganate, or ruthenate of a metal or rare earth element (e.g. Al203,<br>
Ce02, Y?,Oa, MgO, Gd203, strontium titanate, gadolinium zirconate, yttria-<br>
stabilized zirconia, AIN, Si3N4, LaMn04, La2Zr207, or La2-xCexZr207. The buffer<br>
layers may be deposited using any known method, including physical and<br>
chemical deposition methods. A cap layer overlays the superconducting layer and<br>
provides protection of the superconducting layer from chemical and mechanical<br>
degradation. The cap layer may be conductive. The cap layer may be sputtered<br>
Ag or other inert metal.<br>
[0055] In one or more layers, superconducting materials having high lc(ab) or<br>
high lc(c) are obtained by selective processing of the layers. In the examples<br>
above, wherein the two superoondnctor layers are deposited on the same<br>
substrate, this can be accomplished by changing the processing conditions used<br>
to form the superconductor during the process. Typically, reaction to form the<br>
superconductor is initiated at the interface with the underlvina buffer laver and the<br><br>
superconductor grows from that interface outward. Thus, changing conditions<br>
midway in the process from those that favor a high lc(c) material to those that<br>
favor a high lc(ab) material results in a layered structure with different current<br>
carrying properties. Alternatively, the two superconductor layers can be<br>
separately processed to optimize performance and joined after HTS formation.<br>
[0056] Exemplary superconducting materials having good performance in<br>
H//ab include rare earth (RE)-alkatine earth-copper oxides in which the metals are<br>
substantially in stoichiometric proportions. Thus, by way of example, RE-123, in<br>
which the rare earth, barium andcopper are in substantially 1:2:3 proportions<br>
have been found to exhibit optimal current in magnetic fields oriented parallel to<br>
the ab plane. An exemplary oxide superconductor is YE^CusOy-s.<br>
[0057] Superconducting materials rich in copper or deficient in alkaline earth<br>
metal also exhibit high !c(ab). In one or more embodiments, the superconducting<br>
oxide is a rare earth barium copper oxide in which the copper to barium ratio is<br>
greater than 1.5. The Cu:Ba ratio is achieved by reducing the amount of barium in<br>
the oxide superconductor, i.e., the proportion of barium is less than 2.0, or by<br>
increasing the copper content, i.e., the proportion of copper is greater than 3.0, in<br>
the RE-123 composition. In some embodiments, the oxide supei conductor<br>
contains an excess of copper, for example, up to 5% excess, or up to 10% excess<br>
or up to 20% excess copper as compared to the amount of copper required to<br>
prepare stoichiometric RE-123. In other embodiments, the oxide superconductor<br>
contains an deficiency of barium, for example, up to 5% deficiency, or up to 10%<br>
deficiency or up to 20% deficiency of barium as compared to the amount of<br>
copper required to prepare stoichiometric RE-123.<br>
[0058] In one or more embodiments, a copper interlayer is used in whole or in<br>
part to supply excess copper. For example, a copper layer is deposited as an<br>
interlayer in between two.supereohductor layers in a double layer wire, as in<br>
Figures 4A-4D. During the necessary heat treatments to form the oxide<br>
superconductor, copper diffuses into both superconductor layers 440, 470,<br>
forming copper-rich HTS layers. Further information on the use of copper<br><br>
interlayers in the processing of copper-rich HTS wires is found in co-pending and<br>
commonly owned United States Patent Publication No. 2006-0094603, published<br>
on May "4, 2006, and entitled "Thick Superconductor Films With Improved<br>
Performance," the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
[0059] In certain embodiments, increases in Cu concentration of up to 20%<br>
excess Cu increase the lc(ab). Figure 6 is a plot of critical currenf(lc) versus<br>
magnetic field orientation (ยฉ). 75K) for oxide superconductors of various<br>
compositions. Curves 610 and 610' measure the current over a range of 0 at 1T<br>
and 3T, respectively, for a Y-123 layer containing 7.5% excess copper. The<br>
curves exhibit a strong maximum at 90ยฐ (H//ab) and a minimum at 0ยฐ (H//c), thus<br>
demonstrating the optimal performance of this superconductor composition at<br>
H//ab. Copper-rich Y-123 also exhibits a strong current anisotropy between H//ab<br>
and H//c, where the ratio of lc(ab) to lc(c) is about 2.4 at 1T and 6 at 3T. In one or<br>
more embodiments, a high lc(c) superconductor has an lc(c) of greater 20-55<br>
A/cm-width 65K at 3T and an !c(abj/lc(c) ratio greater than 2.5, or greater than 3.5<br>
or greater than 5.5 in a magnetic field of at least 1 Testa. Such ratios have been<br>
obtained for magnetic field strengths of up to 6 Tesla and it is anticipated that<br>
such ratios may be appropriate in even higher magnetic fields.<br>
[0060] Exemplary superconducting materials having good performance in H//c<br>
include rare earth (RE)-alkaline earth-copper oxides containing an excess of rare<br>
earth element or two or more rare earth elements in stoichiometric proportions or<br>
in excess of stoichiometric proportions. Without being bound by any particular<br>
mode of operation, the excess rare earth is believed to improve lc(c) by forming<br>
Tianoscaie defects that serve as flux pinning centers. Atomistic defects may be<br>
achieved by introducing different rare earth elements into the Y-123<br>
superconductor. In one or more embodiments, up to about 25% addition to, for<br>
example, a yttrium-containing composition, or up to about 150% substitution of a<br>
rare earth element is contemplated. In one or more embodiments, the rare earth<br>
element is holmium and/or erbium. Introduction of two or more rare earths into<br>
the oxide superconductor layer not only increases lc(c), but it also decreases the<br>
difference (anisotropy) between lc(ab) and lc(c). Referrina to Fiaure fi. curves<br><br>
620 and 620' measure the current over a range of 0 at 1T and 3T, respectively,<br>
for a Y-123 layer containing 25% erbium addition to the superconductor<br>
composition, e.g., Y:Er = 4:1. Curves 630 and 630' measure the current over a<br>
range of magnetic field orientations at 1T and 3T, respectively, for a Y-123 layer<br>
containing 50% additional erbium, e.g., Y:Er = 2:1. The critical current at 90ยฐ<br>
(H//ab) has decreased significantly, while the critical current at 0ยฐ (H//c) has<br>
increased, thus demonstrating that the composition of the superconducting layers<br>
can be selected to improve the critical current at H//c, in absolute terms, as well as<br>
to reduce the current anisotropy between lc(ab) and lc(c). The ratio of lc(ab) to<br>
lc(c) for the 25% erbium-supplemented Y-123 is about 1.8 at IT and 2.6 at 3T,<br>
while the ratio of H//ab to H//c for the 50% erbium-supplemented Y-123 is about<br>
1.2 at 1T and 1,6 at 3T. This is considerably less than the current anisotropy of a<br>
high lc(ab) wire. Compare, lc(ab)/lc(c) of 2.4 (1T) and 6.0 (3T) for copper-rich Y-<br>
123. In one or more embodiments, a high lc(c) superconductor layer has an<br>
lc(ab)/lc(c) ratio of less than 2.6, or less than 2.0 or less than 1,5 in a-magnetic<br>
field of at least 1 Tesla. Such ratios have been obtained for magnetic field<br>
strengths of up to 6 Tesla and it is anticipated that such ratios may be appropriate<br>
in even higher magnetic fields.<br>
[0061] In one or more embodiments, the high lc(c) superconductor materia!<br>
includes a second phase nanoparticle within the grain of the oxide<br>
superconductor. The nanoparticle is made up of a metal-containing compound<br>
and may contain one or more of rare earth element, an alkaline earth metal, and a<br>
transition metal. The second phase nanoparticle may be one or more of<br>
zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, Y2CU2O5, Y2BaCu04, magnesium oxide,<br>
BaZrOa, silver and Ce02. Other compositions suitable for forming nanometer-<br>
sized defects in the oxide superconductor grains to pin flux lines and improve<br>
current carrying properties in a magnetic field are found in co-pending and<br>
commonly owned application United States Serial No. 10/758,710, filed January<br>
16, 2005, and entitled "Oxide Films with Nanodot Flux Pinning Centers," the<br>
entirety of which is incorporated by reference.<br><br>
[0062] In one or more embodiments, the thickness of the high !c(ab) and high<br>
lc(c) layers may be selected to provide a preselected performance in a magnetic<br>
field orientation. Thus, by way of example, to make a tape or wire most suitable to<br>
perform in a magnetic field With orientation 45 degrees to the tape surface, one<br>
can use both a high lc(c) superconductor layer and a high lc(ab) superconductor<br>
layer, where the !c(c) layer is thinner relative to the lc(ab) layer based on data<br>
such as is presented in Figure 6, The relative ihickness of the two layers can be<br>
adjusted to obtain, for example, lc(c) &gt; 80 A/cm-width and lc(ab)/lc(c) of greater<br>
than 2, or lc(c) &gt; 120-150 A/cm-width and lc(ab)/lc(c) of greater than 2, or lc(c) &gt;<br>
150-180 A/cm-width and lc(ab)/lc(c) of 2-3.<br>
[0063] In one or more embodiments, the superconductor layers are deposited<br>
by metal organic deposition (MOD). A precursor solution containing the<br>
constituent elements of the first oxide superconductor layer is deposited and the<br>
precursor layer is decomposed into an intermediate metaloxy: layer before<br>
application of the second superconductor layer. A second precursor solution<br>
containing the constituent metallic elements of the second oxide superconductor<br>
layer is then deposited and decomposed into an intermediate metaloxy layer. The<br>
two intermediate layers are then fully converted into an HTS layer. By way of<br>
example, the precursor solutions may include metal salts including fluoride, and<br>
the precursor may be decomposed to form an intermediate metal oxyfluoride<br>
layer. The metal oxyfluoride layer may be further heat treated to form an oxide<br>
superconductor. In other embodiments, the first precursor layer is deposited and<br>
fully converted into an oxide superconductor layer. The second precursor layer is<br>
then deposited and also fully converted into an oxide superconductor layer. Each<br>
superconductor layer can be a thickness of about 0.6 um to about 1.5 urn, or even<br>
greater. The total thickness of the superconducting layers can range from about<br>
0.6 um to about 2.0 um and generally does not exceed about 3 um.<br>
[QQ64] In other embodiments, each superconducting layer is deposited on a<br>
separate substrate, i.e., an HTS assembly. The coated substrates are then joined<br>
to form an HTS wire containing two substrate/superconductor layer assemblies.<br><br>
including a substrate, one or more buffer layers, a superconductor layer, and one<br>
or more cap layers.<br>
[0065] The HTS assemblies may be joined at their respective substrates, so<br>
that the capped superconductor layers face outward, as illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
HTS wire 700 is made up of two HTS assemblies 710 and 720. Each of these<br>
assemblies is'fabricated using techniques known in the art and that are described<br>
in greater detail herein. Assembly 710 includes a metal substrate 760. Substrate<br>
760 contains at least a biaxially textured surface to provide a crystal template for<br>
buffer layer 750 and HTS layer 740. Buffer layer 750 overlays substrate 760 and<br>
may comprise one or more layers. HTS layer 740 overlays buffer layer 750 may<br>
be any HTS material. In one or more embodiments, the HTS layer includes a rare<br>
earth-alkaline earth-copper oxide, such as Y-123, that is optimized for<br>
performance in either H//ab or H//c. Cap layer 730 is located above HTS layer<br>
740 and provides protection of the HTS layer from chemical and mechanical<br>
degradation. Insert 720' may have the identical or similar structure, including<br>
substrate 760', buffer layer 750', HTS layer 740', and cap layer 730'. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, superconductor layer 740 is shown as a high<br>
lc(c) superconductor material and superconductor layer 740' is shown as a high<br>
lc(ab) material, however, it is readily apparent that both superconductor layers<br>
may be high lc(ab) material or high lc(c) material.<br>
[0066] Adhesive 780 bonds assembly 710 to assembly 720 at their respective<br>
substrates, creating HTS assembly 700. Cap layers 730 and 730' face outward in<br>
assembly 700, and substrates 760 and 760' are internally located in assembly<br>
700. This configuration provides, for example, efficient electrical contact with an<br>
external current-source and efficient joining of lengths of superconductor wire. The<br>
outer surfaces of the assembly are electrically conductive cap layers 730 and<br>
73jQ'. These layers provide convenient electrically conductive paths to respective<br>
HTS .layers 7-10 and 740'. In order to introduce current into the i ITS layers, a<br>
connection between the current source and the assembly can be made anywhere<br>
on the outer surface of the assembly.<br><br>
[0067] In order to facilitate bonding between HTS assemblies 710 and 720,<br>
wetting layers, e.g., Ag or Cu, (not shown) can optionally be coated onto<br>
substrates 760 and 760'. These wetting layers facilitate the bonding of each<br>
assembly to adhesive layer 780, and therefore facilitate the bonding of each<br>
assembly to the other. In one or more embodiments, adhesive layer 780 is made<br>
- of solder, a resin, epoxy, or other non-conductive material. An exemplary' solder<br>
is Pb-Sn-Ag. During processing, the back surfaces of the metallic substrates {i.e.<br>
the surfaces that do not face the buffer layer) may grow a native oxide layer,<br>
which is an electrical insulator. This oxide layer typically does not wet solder, i.e.<br>
does not bond to solder. The addition of Ag wetting layers to substrates 760 and<br>
760' makes the back surface wettable, i.e. bondable, to solder adhesive layer 780.<br>
Thus, bonding can be accomplished by soldering wetting layers that are bonded<br>
to the native oxide surfaces of the substrates.<br>
[0068] In applications where good electrical contact between the substrates is<br>
-desired, the electrically insulating native oxide layers on substrates 760 and 760'<br>
may be first removed. This removal can be done, e.g., by etching, electro-<br>
polishing, sputtering, or shot blasting. Then metallic wetting layers, e.g., Ag or Cu,<br>
are coated onto the respective back surfaces of substrates 760 and 760' to<br>
prevent the regrowth of the native oxide on the substrate surfaces. Rigorous<br>
removal of the native oxide layer is not required, however, in order to provide an<br>
HTS wire according to one or more embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Further detail on HTS assemblies for use in one or more embodiments of the<br>
present invention may be found in co-pending and commonly owned U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 11/193,262, filed on July 29, 2005, and entitled "Architecture For<br>
High Temperature Superconductor Wire," the context of which is incorporated in<br>
its entirety by reference.<br>
[0069] In another embodiment of the present invention, the HTS assemblies<br>
may be jcjncd at their respective cap layers, so that the capped superconductor<br>
layers face inward, as illustrated in Figure 8. HTS wire 800 is made up of two<br>
HTS assemblies 810 and 820. Each of these assemblies is fabricated using<br><br>
810 includes a metal substrate 830. Substrate 830 contains at least a biaxially<br>
textured surface to provide a crystal template for buffer layer 840 and HTS layer<br>
850. Buffer layer 840 overlays substrate 830 and may comprise one or more<br>
layers. HTS layer 850 overlays buffer layer 840 may be any HTS material. In one<br>
or more embodiments, the HTS layer includes a rare earth-alkaline earth-copper<br>
oxide, such as Y-123, that is optimized for performance at either H//ab or H//c.<br>
Cap layer 860 is located above HTS layer 850 and provides protection of the HTS<br>
layer from chemical and mechanical degradation. Insert 820 may have the<br>
identical or similar structure, including substrate 830', buffer layer 840', HTS layer<br>
850', and cap layer 860'. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 8,<br>
superconductor layer 840 is shown as a high lc(c) superconductor materia'! and<br>
superconductor layer 840' is shown as a high lc(ab) material, however, it is readily<br>
apparent that both superconductor layers may be high lc(ab) material or high lc(c)<br>
material. The individual HTS assemblies are joined at cap layers 860, 860' using<br>
one of a variety of methods. For example, exemplary joining techniques include โข<br>
soldering and diffusion bonding. An exemplary solder layer 880 is shown in<br>
Figure 8 joining the two HTS assemblies 810, 820. Further information regarding<br>
HTS assemblies is found in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 6,828,507, which is<br>
incorporated in its entirety by reference.<br>
[0070] In one or more embodiments, the electrical stability of the two<br>
superconductor layer HTS wires is further enhanced by surrounding the<br>
superconductor wire, e.g., such as the wire shown in Figures 7 and 8, with an<br>
electrically conductive structure 900, as is illustrated in Figure 9. The electrically<br>
conductive structure allows current transport from one superconductor layer to<br>
another. This provides a redundant current path, thereby improving the stability of<br>
the wire to quenching and reducing the sensitivity of the wire to local defects and<br>
variations in performance. The electrically conductive structure may include<br>
upper and lower conductive strips 910, 910' in electrical contact with HTS<br>
assemblies 7fb arid 720. A substantially nonporous electrically conductive filler<br>
920, 920' extends between the first and second conductive strips along the sides<br>
of the superconductor wire assembly to isolate the HTS assemblies from the<br><br>
environment and to provide electrical connectivity between the two<br>
superconductor layers and to an external electrical connection.<br>
[0071] In wire 900, filler 920, 920' provides electrical communication between<br>
the HTS assemblies 710, 720. In essence filler 920, 920' behaves as a<br>
conductive conduit, or bridge. Though filler 920, 920' is conductive, as current<br>
flows through wire 900, the current will generally follow the path of least<br>
resistance, which is through one or both HTS assemblies 710, 720. The presence<br>
of redundant electrical pathways for the current improves the electrical stability of<br>
the wire and increases the current-carrying capacity of wire 900 over that of a<br>
single, assembly or two isolated assemblies. Lastly, filler 920, 920' provides a<br>
means to introduce electrical current into one or both of HTS assemblies 710,<br>
720. By simply contacting a current source to filler 920, 920', current flows via the<br>
filler into the HTS assemblies. Because filler 920, 920' is in contact with<br>
conductive stabilizer strips 910, 910', contacting a current source to one or both of<br>
strips 910, 910' also introduces current to one or both of HTS assemblies 710,<br>
720.<br>
[0072] Material 920, 920' is selected such that it is nonporous, has sufficient<br>
strength and is coatable to a sufficient thickness to substantially surround and seal<br>
wire 900. The thick coating of filler 920, 920' on the sides of wire 900 also adds<br>
mechanical strength to the wire and may help to prevent delamination of wire 900<br>
due to bending or other sources of potential damage. Material 920, 920' adds<br>
thermal stability to the wire by providing additional heat capacity. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the wire has sufficient filler width to meet the mechanical strength<br>
and durability requirements of wire 900, but not much more. A typical individual<br>
filler width ranges from 0.025-0.2 mm, but can be higher or lower (e.g. 0.005-1<br>
mm).<br>
[0073] Stabilizer strips 910 and 910' further enhance the mechanical, electrical,<br>
and thermal stability of wire 900. Strips 910, 910' can be the same or different,<br>
depending upon the desired characteristics of the resulting wire. The thickness of<br>
the strips can be varied throughout a wide range of about 0.01-2 mm, depending<br><br>
upon the desired application, e.g., between 0.05-0.075 mm, to as high as or<br>
higher than 1 mm. Strips 910 and 910' are generally a flexible conductive<br>
material, e.g. metal, e.g. aluminum, copper, silver, nickel, iron, stainless steel,<br>
aluminum alloy, copper alloy, silver alloy, nickel alloy, nickel tungsten alloy, or iron<br>
alloy. For most applications, a high conductivity metal such as copper is<br>
preferred. For a fault current limiter application, a mechanically strong, high<br>
resistivitv allov such as stainless steel is preferred.<br>
[0074] In some embodiments, stabilizer strips 910 and 910' have a width that is<br>
greater than the width of HTS assemblies 710 and 720. This excess width, or<br>
overhang, allows layers or fillets of filler 920, 920' to form along the sides of the<br>
wire by capillary action. Generally, the width of strips 910, 910' fall within the<br>
range of 0.01-2 mm greater than the width of HTS assemblies 710, 720. For<br>
example, stabilizer strips with a width of about 4.3 mm can be used with 4.0 or 4.1<br>
mm wide superconducting inserts.<br>
[0075] HTS wire, e.g., wire 1000 may be manufactured as illustrated in FIG.<br>
10. HTS wire assemblies are fabricated as wide (e.g. about 4 to 10 cm wide)<br>
multilayer strips and then slit lengthwise into several narrow (e.g. about 10 strips<br>
of about 0.-1 cm wide, from a 4 cm wide strip) strips, which form HTS assemblies<br>
1010,1020. See Step 1190 of Figure 11. Conductive stabilizer strips 1060, 1060'<br>
may be wider than the width of the narrow HTS strip, so that the stabilizer strips<br>
overhang the HTS strip on both sides. After slitting, the wire is formed by joining<br>
narrow HTS insert strips 1010, 1020 with stabilizer strips 1060, 1060' in a bath<br>
1000 of filler material. Multilayer HTS inserts 1010, 1020, for example, may be<br>
fed into the filler bath from reels 1010, 1010'. Stabilizer strips 1060, 1060' may be<br>
fed off reels 1020, 1020' placed above and below the feed-in reels 1010, 1010' of<br>
HTS 1010, 1020 so that the lengths of material form a stacked configuration. The<br>
filler simultaneously surrounds and HTS assemblies 1010, 1020 and also<br>
.laminates thm to the conductive stabilizer strips 1060, 1060'. Die 1030 merges<br>
and consolidates inserts 1010,1020 and stabilizer strips 1060, 1060' into one<br>
superconducting wire 1000. By laminating the stabilizer strips to the wire after<br>
fabricatina and slittinn the HTS inserts thp stahiii7or ctrinc ran oaciiw Ko m^Aa<br><br>
wider than the inserts. The overhanging feature promotes the capillary wicking of<br>
the solder between the upper and lower stabilizer strips 1060, 1060' to provide<br>
thick, mechanically robust fillets of filler on the sides of the wire.<br>
[0076] Further detail on electrically conductive structures for use with one or<br>
more embodiments of the HTS wires of the present invention may be found in co-<br>
pending and commonly owned United States Patent Application No. "11/193,262,<br>
filed on July 29, 2005, and entitled "Architecture For High Temperature<br>
Superconductor Wire," the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety by<br>
reference.<br>
[0077]- Wires having different performance characteristics can be joined end-to-<br>
end to obtain an HTS wire that varies in performance along its length. This is<br>
facilitated by use of the HTS wires having an electrically conductive outer<br>
structure that provides electrical contact with the oxide superconductor layer, such<br>
as is illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
[0078] HTS wires such as described herein may be used in electromagnetic<br>
coils or windings. Thus, the HTS wire is wound to form a coil such that the HTS<br>
wire in the region of the coil experiencing a magnetic field with a strong H//ab<br>
component is made up of HTS wire having a high lc(ab). Similarly, the HTS wire<br>
in the region of the coil experiencing a magnetic field with a strong H//c<br>
component is made up of HTS wire having a high lc(c) and optionally, a desired<br>
ratio lc(ab)/lc(c). Regions of the coil experiencing magnetic field of intermediate<br>
orientation are made up from HTS wires having a desired combination of high<br>
lo(ab) and high !c(c) superconducting layers to obtain a desired lc(c) and<br>
optionally, a desired ratio lc(ab)/lc(c).- In addition, the thicknesses of the two<br>
layers may be selected to obtain the desired combination of current density<br>
parallel to and perpendicular to the tape surface.<br>
[0073] Fig. i i illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary process used to<br>
manufacture an HTS wire according to various embodiments of the present<br>
invention. At a first station 1110, a wire substrate is treated to obtain biaxial<br><br>
crystallographic orientation. For example, the surface can be a biaxialiy textured<br>
surface (e.g., a (113)[211] surface) or a cube textured surface (e.g., a (100)[011]<br>
surface or a (100)[001] surface). Preferably, the peaks in an X-ray diffraction pole<br>
figure of the surface have a FWHM of less than about 20ยฐ (e.g., less than about<br>
15ยฐ, less than about 10ยฐ, or from about 5ยฐ to about 10ยฐ).<br>
[0080] The surface can be prepared, for example, by rolling and annealing.<br>
Surfaces can also be prepared using vacuum processes, such as ion beam<br>
assisted deposition, inclined substrate deposition and other vacuum techniques<br>
known in the art to form a biaxialiy textured surface on, for example, a randomly<br>
oriented polycrystalline or amorphous surface. In certain embodiments (e.g.,<br>
when ion beam assisted deposition is used), the surface of the substrate need not<br>
be textured (e.g., the surface can be randomly oriented polycrystalline, or the<br>
surface can be amorphous).<br>
[0081] The substrate can be formed of any material capable of supporting a<br>
buffer layer stack and/or a layer of superconductor material, and capable of<br>
providing the mechanical properties required for the final wire. Examples of<br>
substrate materials that can be used as the substrate include for example, metals<br>
and/or alloys, such as nickel, silver, copper, zinc, aluminum, iron, chromium,<br>
vanadium, palladium, molybdenum and/or their alloys. In some embodiments, the<br>
substrate can be formed of a superalloy. In certain embodiments, the substrate<br>
can be in the form of an object having a relatively large surface area (e.g., a wire<br>
or a wafer). In these embodiments, the substrate is preferably formed of a<br>
relatively flexible material.<br>
[0082] In some of these embodiments, the substrate is a binary alloy that<br>
contains two of the following metals: copper, nickel, chromium, vanadium,<br>
aluminum, silver, iron, palladium, molybdenum, tungsten, gold and zinc. For<br>
example, a binary alloy can be formed of nickel and chromium (e.g., nickel and at<br>
most 20 atomic percent chromium, nickel and from about five to about 18 atomic<br>
percent chromium, or nickel and from about 10 to about 15 atomic percent<br>
chromium). As another example, a binary alloy can be formed of nickel and<br><br>
copper (e.g., copper and from about five to about 45 atomic percent nickel, copper<br>
and from about 10 to about 40 atomic percent nickel, or copper and from about 25<br>
to about 35 atomic percent nickel). As a further example, a binary alloy can<br>
contain nickel and tungsten (e.g., from about one atomic percent tungsten to<br>
about 20 atomic percent tungsten, from about two atomic percent tungsten to<br>
about 10 atomic percent tungsten, from about three atomic percent tungsten to<br>
about seven atomic percent tungsten, about five atomic percent tungsten). A<br>
binary alloy can further include relatively small amounts of impurities (e.g., less<br>
than about 0.1 atomic percent of impurities, less than about 0.01 atomic percent of<br>
impurities, or less than about 0.005 atomic percent of impurities). Ni-5wt.%W is a<br>
preferred material for the substrate.<br>
[0083] In certain of these embodiments, the substrate contains more than two<br>
metals (e.g., a ternary alloy or a quartemary alloy). In some of these<br>
embodiments, the alloy can contain one or more oxide formers (e.g., Mg, Al, Mo,<br>
V, Ta, Ti, Cr, Ga, Ge, Zr, Hf, Y, Si, Pr, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Lu, Th, Er, Tm, Be, Ce,<br>
Nd, Sm, Yb and/or La, with Al being the preferred oxide former), as well as two of<br>
the following metals: copper, nickel, chromium, tungsten, vanadium, aluminum,<br>
silver, iron, palladium, molybdenum, gold and zinc. In certain of these<br>
embodiments, the alloy can contain two of the following metals: copper, nickel,<br>
chromium, tungsten, vanadium, aluminum, silver, iron, palladium, molybdenum,<br>
gold and zinc, and can be substantially devoid of any of the aforementioned oxide<br>
formers.<br>
[0084] In embodiments in which the alloys contain an oxide former, the alloys<br>
can contain at least about U.5 atomic percent oxide former (e.g., at least about<br>
one atomic percent oxide former, or at least about two atomic percent oxide<br>
former) and at most about 25 atomic percent oxide former (e.g., at most about 10<br>
atomic percent oxide former, or at most about four atomic percent oxide former).<br>
For example the alloy ran include an oxide former (e.g., at least about 0.5<br>
aluminum), from about 25 atomic percent to about 55 atomic percent nickel (e.g.,<br>
from about 35 atomic percent to about 55 atomic percent nickel, or from about 40<br>
atomic Dercent to about 55 atomic Dercent nioken with thi=&gt; halannp hainn mnner<br><br>
As another example, the alloy can include an oxide former (e.g., at least about 0.5<br>
atomic aluminum), from about five atomic percent to about 20 atomic percent<br>
chromium (e.g., from about 10 atomic percent to about 18 atomic percent<br>
chromium, or from about 10 atomic percent to about 15 atomic percent chromium)<br>
with the balance being nickeL The alloys can include relatively small amounts of<br>
additional metals (e.g., less than about 0.1 atomic percent of additional metals,<br>
less than about 0.01 atomic percent of additional metals, or less than about 0.005<br>
atomic percent of additional metals).<br>
[0085] A substrate formed of an alloy can be produced by, for example,<br>
combining the constituents in powder form, melting and cooling or, for example, by<br>
diffusing the powder constituents together in solid state. The alloy can then be<br>
formed by deformation texturing (e.g., annealing and rolling, swaging, extrusion<br>
and/or drawing) to form a textured surface (e.g., biaxially textured or cube<br>
textured). Alternatively, the alloy constituents can be stacked in a jelly roll<br>
configuration, and then deformation textured. In some embodiments, a material<br>
with a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (e.g., Nb, Mo, Ta, V, Cr, Zr,<br>
Pd, Sb, NbTi, an intermetallic such as NiAl or Ni3AI, or mixtures thereof) can be<br>
formed into a rod and embedded into the alloy prior to deformation texturing.<br>
[0086] In some embodiments, stable oxide formation at the surface can be<br>
mitigated until a first epitaxial (for example, buffer) layer is formed on the biaxially<br>
textured alloy surface, using an intermediate layer disposed on the surface of the<br>
substrate. Intermediate layers include those epitaxial metal or alloy layers that do<br>
not form surface oxides when exposed to conditions as established by P02 and<br>
temperature required for the initial growth of epitaxial buffer layer films. In<br>
addition, the buffer layer acts as a barrier to prevent substrate element(s) from<br>
migrating to the surface of the intermediate layer and forming oxides during the<br>
initial growth of the epitaxial layer. Absent such an intermediate layer, one or<br>
.mere-elements In the substrate would be expected to form thermodynarnicaity<br>
stable oxide(s) at the substrate surface which could significantly impede the<br>
deposition of epitaxial layers due to, for example, lack of texture in this oxide layer.<br><br>
[0087] Exemplary intermediate metal layers include nickel, gold, silver,<br>
palladium, and alloys thereof. Additional metals or alloys may include alloys of<br>
nicke! and/or copper. Epitaxial films or layers deposited on an intermediate layer<br>
can include metal oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and nitrides. In some<br>
embodiments, the intermediate metal layer does not oxidize under epitaxial film<br>
deposition conditions.<br>
[0088] Care should be taken that the deposited intermediate layer is not<br>
completely incorporated into or does not completely diffuse into the substrate<br>
before nucleation and growth of the initial buffer layer structure causes the<br>
epitaxial layer to be established. This means that after selecting the metal (or<br>
alloy) for proper attributes such as diffusion constant in the substrate alloy,<br>
thermodynamic stability against oxidation under practical epitaxial buffer layer<br>
growth conditions and lattice matching with the epitaxial layer, the thickness of the<br>
deposited metal layer has to be adapted to the epitaxial layer deposition<br>
conditions, in particular to temperature.<br>
[0089] Deposition of the intermediate metal layer can be done in a vacuum<br>
process such as evaporation or sputtering, or by electro-chemical means such as<br>
electroplating (with or without electrodes). These deposited intermediate metal<br>
layers may or may not be epitaxial after deposition (depending on substrate<br>
temperature during deposition), but epitaxial orientation can subsequently be<br>
obtained during a post-deposition heat treatment.<br>
[0090] In certain embodiments, sulfur can be formed on the surface of the<br>
substrate or intermediate layer. The sulfur can be formed, for example, by<br>
exposing the intermediate layer to a gas environment containing a source of sulfur<br>
(e.g., H2S, a tantalum foil or a silver foil) and hydrogen (e.g., hydrogen, or a mix of<br>
hydrogen and an inert gas, such as a 5% hydrogen/argon gas mixture) for a<br>
period of time (e.g., from about 10 seconds to about one hour, from about one<br>
minute to about 30 minutes, from about five minutes to about 15 minutes). This<br>
can be performed at elevated temperature (e.g., at a temperature of from about<br>
450ยฐC to about 1100ยฐC, from about 600ยฐC to about 900ยฐC, 850ยฐC). The pressure<br><br>
of the hydrogen (or hydrogen/inert gas mixture) can be relatively low (e.g.., less<br>
than about one torr, less than about 1x10~3 torr, less than about 1x10"6 torr) or<br>
relatively high (e.g., greater than about 1 torr, greater than about 100 torr, greater<br>
than about 760 torr).<br>
[0091] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that exposing the<br>
textured substrate surface fo a source of sulfur under these conditions can result<br>
in the formation of a superstructure (e.g., a c(2x2) superstructure) of sulfur on the<br>
textured substrate surface. It is further believed that the superstructure can be<br>
effective in stabilizing (e.g., chemically and/or physically stabilizing) the surface of<br>
the intermediate layer.<br>
[0092] While one approach to forming a sulfur superstructure has been<br>
described, other methods of forming such superstructures can also be used. For<br>
example, a sulfur superstructure (e.g., S c(2x2)) can be formed by applying an<br>
appropriate organic solution to the surface of the intermediate layer by heating to<br>
an appropriate temperature in an appropriate gas environment. Moreover, while<br>
formation of a sulfur superstructure on the surface of the intermediate layer has<br>
been described, it is believed that other superstructures may also be effective in<br>
stabilizing (e.g.. chemically and/or physically stabilizing) the surface. For<br>
example, it is believed that an oxygen superstructure, a nitrogen superstructure, a<br>
carbon superstructure, a potassium superstructure, a cesium superstructure, a<br>
lithium superstructure or a selenium superstructure disposed on the surface may<br>
be effective in enhancing the stability of the surface.<br>
[0093] In a second processing station 112Q, one or more buffer layers are<br>
formed on the textured substrate by epitaxial growth on a textured metal surface.<br>
Alternatively, a buffer layer can be formed on a polycrystalline, randomly textured<br>
metal surface using ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). In this technique, a<br>
buffer layer material is evaporated using, for example, electron beam evaporation,<br>
sputtering deposition, or pulsed laser deposition while an ion beam (e.g., an argon<br>
ion beam) is directed at a smooth amorphous surface of a substrate onto which<br>
the evaporated buffer layer material is deposited.<br><br>
[0094] For example, the buffer layer can be formed by ion beam assisted<br>
deposition by evaporating a buffer layer material having a rock-salt like structure<br>
(e.g., a material having a rock salt structure, such as an oxide, including MgO, or<br>
a nitride) onto a smooth, amorphous surface (e.g., a surface having a root mean<br>
square roughness of less than about 100 Angstroms) of a substrate so that the<br>
buffer layer material has a surface with substantial alignment (e.g., about 13ยฐ or<br>
.less),'both in-plane and out-of-piane.<br>
[0095] The conditions used during deposition of the buffer layer material can<br>
include, for example, a substrate temperature of from about 0ยฐC to about 750ยฐC<br>
(e.g., from about 0ยฐC to about 400ยฐC, from about room temperature to about<br>
750ยฐC, from about room temperature to about 400ยฐC), a deposition rate of from<br>
about 1.0 Angstrom per second to about 4.4 Angstroms per second, an ion energy<br>
of from about 200 eV to about 1200 eV, and/or an ion flux of from about 110<br>
microamperes per square centimeter to about 120 microamperes per square<br>
centimeter. s<br>
[0096] In some embodiments, when using IBAD, the substrate is formed of a<br>
material having a polycrystalline, non-amorphous base structure (e.g., a metal<br>
alloy, such as a nickel alloy) with a smooth amorphous surface'formed of a<br>
different material (e.g., Si3N4).<br>
[0097] In certain embodiments, a plurality of buffer layers can be deposited by<br>
epitaxial growth on an original IBAD surface. Each buffer layer can have<br>
substantial alignment (e.g., about 13ยฐ or less), both in-plane and out-of-plane.<br>
[0098] A buffer material can be prepared using solution phase techniques,<br>
including mefalorganic deposition, such as disclosed in, for example, S.S. Shoup<br>
et al., J. Am. Cer. Soc, vol. 81, 3019; D. Beach et at., Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proa,<br>
vol. 495, 263 (1988); M. Paranthaman et al., Superconductor Sci. Tech., vol. 12,<br>
319 (1939), D:J. Lee ei al., Japanese J. Appl. Phys., vol. 38, L1'/8'(lyyy) and M.<br>
W. Rupich et al., I.E.E.E. Trans, on Appl. Supercon. vol. 9, 1527. In certain<br>
embodiments, solution coating processes can be used for epitaxial deposition of<br><br>
they can be particularly applicable for deposition of the initial (seed) layer on a<br>
textured metal substrate. The role of the seed layer is to provide 1) protection of<br>
the substrate from oxidation during deposition of the next oxide layer when carried<br>
out in an oxidizing atmosphere relative to the substrate (for example, magnetron<br>
sputter deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia from an oxide target); and 2) an<br>
epitaxial template for growth of subsequent oxide layers. In order to meet these<br>
requirements, the seed layer should grow epitaxialiy over the entire surface of the<br>
metal substrate and be free of any contaminants that may interfere with the<br>
deposition of subsequent epitaxial oxide layers.<br>
[0099] The formation of oxide buffer layers can be carried out so as to promote<br>
wetting of an underlying substrate layer. Additionally, in particular embodiments,<br>
the formation of metal oxide layers can be carried out using metal alkoxide<br>
precursors (for example, "sol gel" precursors).<br>
[0100] Once the textured substrate including buffer layers is prepared, a<br>
precursor solution is deposited at deposition station 1130 as described above.<br>
Optionally, the precursor can be patterned. Additional equipment may be required<br>
to accomplish the patterning operation, for example, when laser ablation or ion<br>
bombardment are used to pattern the superconducting layer.'If dropwise"  	<br>
patterned deposition is used, then a single station equipped with a Inkjet printer<br>
deposition apparatus can accomplish both deposition and patterning of the oxide<br>
precursor solution.<br>
[0101] Typically, solution chemistry is used to prepare barium fluoride and/or<br>
other superconductor precursors: and a solution (e.g., a solution containing metal<br>
salts, such as yttrium acetate, yttrium trifluoroacetate (Y-TFA), copper acetate,<br>
barium acetate and/or a fluorinated salt of barium) is disposed on a surface (e.g.,<br>
on a surface of a substrate, such as a substrate having an alloy layer with one or<br>
more buffer layers disposed thereon). The solution can be disposed on the<br>
surface using standard techniques (e.g., spin coating, dip coating, slot coating).<br>
The solution is dried to remove at least some of the organic compounds present in<br>
the solution (e.g., dried at about room temperature or under mild heat), and the<br><br>
resulting material is reacted (e.g., decomposed) in a furnace in a gas environment<br>
containing oxygen and water to form barium fluoride and/or other appropriate<br>
materials (e.g., CuO and/or Y2O3). In some embodiments, the reactors noted<br>
above can be used in any or all of these steps.<br>
[0102]	Metal salt solutions are prepared using metal sources in the<br>
appropriate proportions desired in the resulting superconductor layer. Thus, for<br>
example, an addition amount of copper salt, in excess of the stoichiometric<br>
proportions used in Y-123, is included in a precursor solution used to prepare a<br>
high lc(ab) superconductor layer having excess copper. Similarly, the precursor<br>
solution may contain additive components, including soluble and insoluble metal<br>
compounds, that are used to modify the final superconductor composition. Such<br>
additives can include, for example, soluble compounds of metal compounds such<br>
as yttrium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,<br>
holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium, alkaline earth metals, such as<br>
calcium, barium and strontium, transition metals, such as scandium, titanium,<br>
vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and zirconium, cerium,<br>
silver, aluminum, and magnesium that are capable of dissolving in the solvents<br>
contained in the precursor solution. Additive components may also include<br>
stoichiometric excesses of soluble compounds included in the precursor solution.<br>
For example, soluble yttrium salts or soluble copper salts may be included in the<br>
precursor solution in excess of that required to form Y123. Insoluble additive<br>
components can also be added to the precursor solution.<br>
[0103] Examples of metal salt solutions that can be used are as follows.<br>
[0104] In some embodiments, the metal salt solution can have a relatively<br>
small amount of free acid. In aqueous solutions, this can correspond to a metal<br>
salt solution with a relatively neutral pH (e.g., neither strongly acidic nor strongly<br>
basic). The metal salt solution can be used to prepare multi-layer<br>
superconductors using a wide variety of materials that can be used as the<br>
underlying layer on which the superconductor layer is formed.<br><br>
[0105] The total free acid concentration of the metal salt solution can be less<br>
than about 1 x10"3 molar (e.g., less than about 1x10"5 molar or about 1 x10"7 molar).<br>
Examples of free acids that can be contained in a metal salt solution include<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acids of iodides, acids of<br>
bromides and acids of sulfates.<br>
[0106] When the metal salt solution"contains water, the precursor composition<br>
can have a pH of at least about 3 (e.g., at least about 5 or about 7).<br>
[0107] In some embodiments, the metal salt solution can(.have a relatively low<br>
water content (e.g., less than about 50 volufne percent water, less than about 35<br>
volume percent water, less than about 25 volume percent water).<br>
[0108] In embodiments in which the metal salt solution contains trifluoroacetate<br>
ion and an alkaline earth metal cation (e.g., barium), the total amount of<br>
trifluoroacetate ion can be selected so that the mole ratio of fluorine contained in<br>
the metal salt solution (e.g., in the form of trifluoroacetate) to the alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., barium ions) contained in the metal salt solution is at least about 2:1<br>
(e.g., from about 2:1 to about 18.5:1, or from about 2:1 to about 10:1).<br>
[010.9] in general, the metal sait solution can be prepared by combining soluble<br>
compounds of a first metal (e.g., copper), a second metal (e.g., an alkaline earth<br>
metal), and a rare earth metal with one or more desired solvents and optionally<br>
water. As used herein, "soluble compounds" of the first, second and rare earth<br>
metals refer to compounds of these metals that are capable of dissolving in the<br>
solvent(s) contained in the metal salt solution. Such compounds include, for<br>
example, salts (e.g., nitrates, acetates, aikoxides, iodides, sulfates and<br>
trifluoroacetates), oxides and hydroxides of these metals.<br>
[0110] In certain embodiments, a metal salt solution can be formed of an<br>
organic solution containing metal trifluoroacetates prepared from powders of<br>
Ba(02CCH3)2&gt; Y(02CCH3)3, and Cu(02CCH3)2 which are combined and reacted<br>
using methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the metal<br><br>
trifluoroacetate powders can be combined in a 2:1:3 ratio in methyl alcohol to<br>
produce a solution substantially 0.94 M based on copper content.<br>
[0111] In certain embodiments, the metal salt solution can contain a Lewis<br>
base. The rare earth metal can be yttrium, lanthanum, europium, gadolinium,<br>
terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, cerium, praseodymium,<br>
โขneodymium, promethiurn, samarium or lutetium. In general, the rare earth metal<br>
,salt can be any rare earth metal salt that is soluble in the solvent(s) contained in<br>
the metal salt solution and that, when being processed to form an intermediate<br>
(e.g., a metal oxyhalide intermediate), forms rare earth oxide(s) (e.g., Y2O3).<br>
Such salts can have, for example, the formula M(02C-(CH2)n-CXX'X")(02C-<br>
(CH2)m-CXmX""X	)(02G-(CH2)p-CX	X	X	) or M(OR)3. M is the rare earth<br>
metal, n, m and p are each at least one but less than a number that renders the<br>
salt insoluble in the solvent(s) (e.g., from one to ten). Each of X, X', X", X'", X"",<br>
X""', X	', X""'" and X"""" is H, F, CI, Br or I. R is a carbon containing group, which<br>
can be halogenated (e.g., CH2CF3) or nonhalogenated. Examples of such salts<br>
include nonhalogenated carboxylates, halogenated acetates "(e.g., trifluoroacetate,<br>
trichloroacetate, tribromoacetate, triiodoacetate), halogenated alkoxides, and<br>
nonhalogenated alkoxides. Examples of such nonhalogenated carboxylates<br>
include nonhalogenated acetates (e.g., M(02C-CH3)3). The alkaline earth metal<br>
can be barium, strontium or calcium. Generally, the alkaline earth metal salt can<br>
be any alkaline earth metal salt that is soluble in the solvent(s) contained in the<br>
metal salt solution and that, when being processed to form an intermediate (e.g., a<br>
metal oxyhalide intermediate), forms an alkaline earth halide compound (e.g.,<br>
BaF2, BaCI2, BaBr2, Bal2) prior to forming alkaline earth oxide(s) (e.g., BaO).<br>
Such salts can have, for example, the formula M,(02C-(CH2)n-CXX,X")(02C-<br>
(CH2)m-CX"'X""X""') or M'(OR)2. M' is the alkaline earth metal, n and m are each<br>
at least one but less than a number that renders the salt insoluble in the solvent(s)<br>
(e.g., from one to ten). Each of X, X', X", X'", X"" and X'"" is H, F, CI, B or, I. R<br>
can be a halogenated or nonhalogenated carbon containing group. Examples of<br>
such salts include halogenated acetates (e.g., trifluoroacetate, trichloroacetate,<br>
tribromoacetate, triiodoacetate). Generally, the transition metal is copper. The<br><br>
transition metal salt should be soluble in the solvent(s) contained in the metal salt<br>
solution. Preferably, during conversion of the precursor to the intermediate (e.g.,<br>
metal oxyhalide), minima! cross-linking occurs between discrete transition metal<br>
molecules (e.g., copper molecules). Such transition metals salts can have, for<br>
example, the formula M"(CXX'X"-CO(CH)aCO-CX"'X""X	)(CX"""X'"""X	-<br>
CO(CH)bCO CX""""'X'".'	X	), M"(02C-(CH2)n-CXX'X") (02C-(CH2)m- ..-.:<br>
CX'"X""X"'") or M"(OR)2. M" is the transition metal, a and b are each at least one<br>
but less than a number that renders the salt insoluble in the solvent(s) (e.g., from<br>
one to five). Generally, n and m are each at least one but less than a number that<br>
renders the salt insoluble in the solvent(s) (e.g., from one to ten). Each of X, X',<br>
X", X'", X"", X'"", X""", X'""", X"""", X"'""", X'	""", X"'"""" is H, F, CI, Br or I. R is a<br>
carbon containing group, which can be halogenated (e.g., CH2CF3) or<br>
nonhalogenated. These salts include, for example, nonhalogenated acetates<br>
(e.g., M"(02C-CH3)2), halogenated acetates, halogenated alkoxides, and<br>
nonhalogenated alkoxides. Examples of such salts include copper<br>
trichloroacetate, copper tribromoacetate, copper triiodoacetate,<br>
Cu(CH3COCHCOCF3)2( Cu(OOCC7H15)2, Cu(CF3COCHCOF3)2,<br>
Cu(CH3COCHCOCH3)2, Cu(CH3CH2C02CHCOCH3)2, CuO(C5H6N)2 and<br>
Cu303Ba2(0-CH2CF3)4. In certain embodiments, the transition meta! salt is a<br>
carboxyiate salt (e.g., a nonhalogenated carboxylate salt), such as a propionate<br>
salt of the transition metal (e.g., a nonhalogenated propionate salt of the transition<br>
metal). An example of a nonhalogenated propionate salt of a transition metal is<br>
Cu(02CC2H5)2. In some embodiments, the transition metal salt is a simple salt,<br>
such as copper sulfate, copper nitrate, copper iodide and/or copper oxylate. In<br>
some embodiments, n and/or m can have the value zero. In certain<br>
embodiments, a and/or b can have the value zero. An illustrative and nonlimiting<br>
list of Lewis bases includes nitrogen-containing compounds, such as ammonia<br>
and amines. Examples of amines include CH3CN, C5H5N and R1R2R3N, Each of<br>
R1.R2.R3 is independently H, an alkyl group (e.g., a straight chained alky! group, a<br>
branched alkyl group, an aliphatic alkyl group, a non-aliphatic alkyl group and/or a<br>
substituted alkyl group) or the like. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that the presence of a Lewis base in the metal salt solution ran rpHnra<br><br>
cross-linking of copper during intermediate formation. It is believed that this is<br>
achieved because a Lewis base can coordinate (e.g., selective coordinate) with<br>
copper ions, thereby reducing the ability of copper to cross-link.<br>
[0112] Typically, the metal salt solution is applied to a surface (e.g., a buffer<br>
layer surface), such as by spin coating, dip coating, web coating, slot coating,<br>
gravure coating, or other techniques known to those skilled in the art, and<br>
subsequently heated.<br>
[0113] At a subsequent station 1140, the precursor components are<br>
decomposed. In the case of precursor components including at least one fluoride-<br>
containing salt, the first step of the heating step is performed to decompose the<br>
metalorganic molecules to one or more oxyfluoride intermediates of the desired<br>
superconductor material.<br>
[0114] Typically, the initial temperature in this step is about room temperature,<br>
and the final temperature is from about 190ยฐC to about 210ยฐC, preferably to a<br>
temperature to about 200ยฐC. Preferably, this step is performed using a<br>
temperature ramp of at least about 5ยฐC per minute, more preferably a temperature<br>
ramp of at least about 10ยฐC per minute, and most preferably a temperature ramp<br>
of at least about 15ยฐC per minute. During this step, the partial pressure of water<br>
vapor in the nominal gas environment is preferably maintained at from about 5<br>
Torr to about 50 Torr, more preferably at from about 5 Torr to about 30 Torr, and<br>
most preferably at from about 20 Torr to about 30 Torr. The partial pressure of<br>
oxygen in the nominal gas environment is maintained at from about 0.1 Torr to<br>
about 760 Torr and preferably at about 730 - 740 Torr.<br>
[0115] Heating is then continued to a temperature of from about 200ยฐC to<br>
about 290ยฐC using a temperature ramp of from about 0.05ยฐC per minute to about<br>
5ยฐC per minute (e.g., from about 0.5ยฐC per minute to about 1ยฐC per minute).<br>
Preferably, the gas enviioiiiiieiii during this heating step is substantially the same<br>
as the nominal gas environment used when the sample is heated to from the initial<br>
temperature to from about 190ยฐC to about 215ยฐC.<br><br>
[0116] Heating is further continued to a temperature of about 650ยฐC, or more<br>
preferably to a temperature of about 400ยฐC, to form the oxyfluoride intermediate.<br>
This step is preferably performed using a temperature ramp of at least about 2ยฐC<br>
per minute, more preferably at least about 3ยฐC per minute, and most preferably at<br>
least about 5ยฐC per minute. Preferably, the gas environment during this heating<br>
step is substantially the same as the nominal gas environment used when the<br>
sample is heated to from the initial temperature to from about 190ยฐC to about<br>
215ยฐC.<br>
[0117] In alternate embodiments, barium fluoride is formed by heating the dried<br>
solution from an initial temperature (e.g., rooro temperature) to a temperature of<br>
from about 190ยฐC to about 215ยฐC (e.g., about 210ยฐC) in a water vapor pressure of<br>
from about 5 Torr to about 50 Torr water vapor (e.g., from about 5 Torr to about<br>
30 TOJT water vapor, or from about 10 Torr to about 25 Torr water vapor). The<br>
nominal partial pressure of oxygen can be, for example, from about 0.1 Torr to<br>
about 760 Torr. In these embodiments, heating is then continued to a<br>
temperature of from about 220ยฐC to about 290ยฐC (e.g., about 220ยฐC) in a water<br>
vapor pressure of from about 5 Torr to about 50 Torr water vapor (e.g., from about<br>
5 Torr to about 30 Torr water vapor, or from about 10 Torr to about 25 Torr water<br>
vapor). The nominal partial pressure of oxygen can be, for example, from about<br>
0.1 Torr to about 760 Torr. This is followed by heating to about 400ยฐC at a rate of<br>
at least about 2ยฐC per minute (e.g., at least about 3ยฐC per minute, or at least<br>
about 5ยฐC per minute) in a water vapor pressure of from about 5 Torr to about 50<br>
Torr water vapor (e.g., from about 5 Torr to about 30 Torr water vapor, or from<br>
about 10 Torr to about 25 Torr water vapor) to form barium fluoride. The nominal<br>
partial pressure of oxygen can be, for example, from about 0.1 Torr to about 760<br>
Torr.<br>
[0118] In certain embodiments, heating the dried solution to form barium<br>
fluoride can include putting the coated sample in a pre heated furnace (e.g., at a<br>
temperature of at least about 100ยฐC, at least about 150ยฐC, at least about 200ยฐC,<br>
at most about 300ยฐC, at most about 250ยฐC, about 200ยฐC). The gas environment<br><br>
predetermined partial pressure of water vapor (e.g. at least about 10 torr, at least<br>
about 15 Torr, at most about 25 Torr, at most about 20 Torr, about 17 Torr) with<br>
the balance being molecular oxygen. After the coated sample reaches the<br>
furnace temperature, the furnace temperature can be increased (e.g., to at least<br>
about 225ยฐC, to at least about 240ยฐC, to at most about 275ยฐC, to at most about<br>
260ยฐC, about 250ยฐC) at a predetermined temperature ramp rate (e.g., at least<br>
about 0.5ยฐC per minute, at least about 0.75ยฐC per minute, at most about 2ยฐC per<br>
minute, at most about 1.5ยฐC per minute, about 1ยฐC per minute). This step can be<br>
performed with the same nominal gas environment used in the first heating step.<br>
The temperature of the furnace can then be further increased (e.g., to at least<br>
about 350ยฐC, to at least about 375ยฐC, to at most about 450ยฐC, to at most about<br>
425ยฐC, about 450ยฐC) at a predetermined temperature ramp rate (e.g., at least<br>
about 5ยฐC per minute, at least about 8ยฐC per minute, at most about 20ยฐC per<br>
minute, at most about 12ยฐC per minute, about 10ยฐC per minute). This step can be<br>
performed with the same nominal gas environment used in the first heating step.<br>
[0119] Additional layers can be deposited over a previously deposited layer,<br>
which have been processed to form an oxyfluoride intermediate film. Processing<br>
conditions are substantially as described herein above; however, the partial<br>
pressure of water vapor during decomposition to the oxyfluoride film is about 5-10<br>
torr.<br>
[0120] The foregoing treatments of a metal salt solution can result in an<br>
oxyfluoride intermediate film in which the constituent metal oxides and metal<br>
fluorides are homogeneously distributed throughout the film. Preferably, the<br>
precursor has a relatively low defect density and is essentially free of cracks<br>
through the intermediate thickness. While solution chemistry for barium fluoride<br>
formation has been disclosed, other methods can also be used for other precursor<br>
solutions.<br>
[0121] I he superconductor intermediate film can then be heated to form the<br>
desired HTS layer at a further processing station 1150. Typically, this step is<br>
performed by heating from about room temperature to a temperature of from<br><br>
about 700ยฐC to about 825ยฐC, preferably to a temperature of about 740ยฐC to 800ยฐC<br>
and more preferably to a temperature of about 750ยฐC to about 790ยฐC, at a<br>
temperature ramp of about greater than 25ยฐC per minute, preferably at a<br>
temperature rate of about greater than 100ยฐC per minute and more preferably at a<br>
temperature rate about greater than 200ยฐC per minute. This step can also start<br>
from the final temperature of about 400 - 650ยฐC used to form the intermediate<br>
oxyfiuoride film. During this step, a process gas is flowed over the film surface to<br>
supply the gaseous reactants to the film and to remove the gaseous reaction<br>
products from the film. The nominal gas environment during this step has a total<br>
pressure of about 0.1 Torr to about 760 Torr and is comprised of about 0.09 Torr<br>
to about 50 Torr oxygen and about 0.01 Torr to about 150 Torr water vapor and.<br>
about 0 Torr to about 750 Torr of an inert gas (nitrogen orargon). More<br>
preferably, the nominal gas environment has a total pressure of about 0.15 Torr to<br>
about 5 Torr and is comprised of about 0.1 Torr to about 1 Torr oxygen and about<br>
0.05 Torr to about 4 Torr water vapor.<br>
[0122] The film is then held at a temperature of about 700ยฐC - 825ยฐC,<br>
preferably to a temperature of about 740ยฐC to 800ยฐC and more preferably to a<br>
temperature of about 750ยฐC to about 790ยฐC, for a time of about at least 5 minutes<br>
to about 120 minutes, preferably for a time of at least about 15 minutes to about<br>
60 minutes, and more preferably for a time of at least about 15 minutes to about<br>
30 minutes. During this step, a process gas is flowed over the film surface to<br>
supply the gaseous reactants to the film and to remove the gaseous reaction<br>
products from the film. The nominal gas environment during~thls step has a total<br>
pressure of about 0.1 Torr to about 760 Torr and is comprised of about 0.09 Torr<br>
to about 50 Torr oxygen and about 0.01 Torr to about 150 Torr water vapor and<br>
about 0 Torr to about 750 Torr of an inert gas (nitrogen or argon). More<br>
preferably, the nominal gas environment has a total pressure of about 0.15 Torr to<br>
about 5 Torr and is comprised of about 0.1 Torr to about 1 Torr oxygen and about<br>
0.U5 Torr to about 4 Torr water vapor.<br>
[0123] The film is then cooled to room temperature in a nominal gas<br><br>
preferably about 0.1 Torr to about 0.5 Torr and more preferably from about 0.1<br>
Torr to about 0.2 Torr.<br>
[0124] Treatment of precursor films as described above provide a<br>
superconductor oxide film of normal 123YBC stoichiometry. Stoichiometry my<br>
vary if the precursor composition contains, for example, additives for the formation<br>
of second phase precipitates for the formation of nanoscale pinning sites.<br>
[0125] Optionally, filamentization can be performed at station 1160 by known<br>
processes, or by processes described in U.S. Patent Application 10/955,801, filed<br>
on September 29, 2004. Further processing by noble metal deposition at station<br>
1170, oxygen annealing in a high oxygen environment, e.g., 760 torr 02, at station<br>
1180, lamination as described herein above and slitting at station 1190 complete<br>
the process.<br>
[0126] The invention is described with reference to the following examples,<br>
which are presented for the purpose of illustration and are in no way intended to<br>
be limiting of the invention.<br>
Example 1. Preparation of a high lc(ab) superconducting layer.<br>
[0127] A Y-123 precursor solution having a stoichiometry of Y:Ba:Cu of<br>
1:2:3.34 was prepared by dissolving about 0.83 grams of Y(CF3C02)3, about 1.60<br>
grams of Ba(CF3C02)2 and about 1.54 grams of Cu(C2H5C02)2 in about 4.85 ml.<br>
of methanol (CH3OH) and about 0.15 ml of propionic acid (C2H6C02). The final<br>
volume of the solution was adjusted to about 5 ml with methanol.<br>
[0128] The precursor solution was deposited by a spin coating technique, at a<br>
speed of 2000 RPM, on a length (20 cm to 10 meter) of 1 cm wide biaxially<br>
textured oxide buffered metallic substrate with the structure<br>
Ni(5at%)WA,203/YSZ/Ce02. A sufficient quantity of precursor solution was<br>
deposited to produce about a 0.8 u.m thick YBa2Cu307.x film.<br>
[0129] The coated sample was decomposed to an intermediate metal<br><br>
temperature to about 200ยฐC at a rate of about 15ยฐC per minute, then from about<br>
200ยฐC to about 250 C at a rate of about 0.9ยฐC per minute and then from about<br>
250ยฐC to about 400ยฐC at a rate of about 5ยฐC per minute in a flowing gas<br>
environment having a total gas pressure of about 760 torr (water vapor pressure<br>
of about 24 torr and balance oxygen).<br>
[0130] The metal oxyfiuoride film was then heat treated to form an oxide<br>
superconductor. A short length (1-2 cm) of the intermediate film was heated in a<br>
tube furnace to about 785ยฐC at a rate of about 200ยฐC per minute and held for<br>
about 30 min in an environment having a total gas pressure of about 240 mtorr<br>
(water vapor pressure of about 90 mtorr, and oxygen gas pressure of about 150<br>
mtorr). After 30 min holding, the H20 vapor removed from the gas environment<br>
and the film was then cooled to room temperature in about 150 mtorr 02. The<br>
resulting film and was about 0.8 micron thick.<br>
Example 2. Preparation of a high lc(c) superconductor layer using _ 50<br>
mol% excess Er-Y 123.<br>
[0131] A precursor solution was prepared by dissolving about 0.83 grams of<br>
Y(CF3C02)3, about 0.138 grams of Er(CH3C02)3, about 1.60 grams of<br>
Ba(CF3C02)2 and about 1.28 grams of Cu(C2H5C02)2 in about 4.85 ml. of<br>
methanol (CH3OH) and about 0.15 ml of propionic acid (C2H6C02). The final<br>
volume of the solution was adjusted to about 5 ml with methanol.<br>
[0132] The precursor was coated, decomposed, processed and Ag coated as<br>
described in Example 1. The resulting film had a smooth and shiny surface, and<br>
surprisingly higher thickness of about 2.6 micron with a single coating. The x-ray<br>
diffraction pattern of the final film showed the presence of was (00I) textured<br>
Y(Er)Ba2Cu307.x.<br><br>
Example 3. Preparation of double coated superconducting layers with<br>
different compositions<br>
[0133] A baseline YBCO precursor solution having a stoichiometry of Y:Ba:Cu<br>
of 1:2:3.23 was prepared by dissolving about 0.85 grams Y(CF3C02)3, about 1.45<br>
grams of Ba(CF3C02)2 and about 1.35 grams of CCaHsCC in about 4.85 ml of<br>
methanol (CH3OH) and about 0.15 ml of propionic-acidHeCO?}. The final<br>
Voiume of the solution was adjusted with methanol to have a Y concentration of<br>
approximately 0.4 molar.<br>
[0134] A YBCO precursor solution with 50% Dysprosium addition having a<br>
stoichiometry of Y:Dy :Ba:Cu of 1:0.5:2:3.23 was prepared by dissolving about<br>
1.70 grams Dy(CH3C02)3, and about 1.90 ml of methanol (CH3OH) in about 20<br>
ml of baseline solution. The final volume of the solution was adjusted with<br>
methanol to have a Y concentration of approximately 0.3 molar.<br>
[0135] The 50%Dy added precursยฃD*$*&gt;lution was deposited on a biaxially<br>
textured oxide buffered metallic substrate with the structure<br>
Ni(5at7o)W/Y203/YSZ/Ce02by slot die coating technique. The solution was<br>
coated on the buffered substrate with the amount targeted to form a 0.8 jam thick<br>
REBa2Cu307-x film.	โข<br>
[0136] The coated sample was decomposed to an intermediate metal<br>
oxyfluoride film by heating, in a 2.25" diameter tube furnace, from room<br>
temperature to about 200ยฐC at a rate of about 15ยฐC per minute, then from about<br>
200ยฐC to about 250 C at a rate of about 0.9ยฐC per minute and then from about<br>
250UC to about 400ยฐC at a rate of about 5ยฐC per minute in a flowing gas<br>
environment having a total gas pressure of about 760 torr (water vapor pressure<br>
of about 17.5 torr and balance oxygen) 20ยฐC.<br>
[0137] The metal oxyfluoride film was then coated with baseline YBCO<br>
precursor solution prepared as described earlier with target final thickness of<br>
0.6um YBa2Cu3Ox.<br><br>
[0138] The coated tape was decomposed again to form the intermediate metal<br>
oxyfluoride by the same process as mentioned earlier except this time the H20<br>
vapor pressure was controlled to about 9.2 torr.<br>
[0139] The decomposed tape was heat treated to form an oxide<br>
superconductor. The tape was joined with 4m of similarly coated NiW leader tape<br>
both in front and in the back to establish the uniform and control environment<br>
during the reaction. The tape was then reacted at 785ยฐC with the following<br>
parameters. The tape was ramped up to 785ยฐC with average ramp rate of about<br>
285ยฐC/min. During reaction, the total pressure during reaction was controlled to<br>
about 1 torr. The H20 partial pressure was about 800 mtorr and oxygen partial<br>
pressure was about 200 mtorr. The reaction time was about 11min. During<br>
cooling, a total pressure of about 1 torr was used with oxygen partial pressure at<br>
about 200 mtorr and N2 partial pressure at about 800 mtorr.<br>
[0140] The reacted film was coated with ~3um of Ag protection layer and then<br>
annealed in 760torr oxygen environment. The resulting film carried lc of about<br>
~500/cm-width or a Jc of about 4 MA/cm2 at 77K, self field. The critical current<br>
(lc) versus magnetic field orientation (0) at 75K and 1 Tesla is plotted in Figure<br>
12. At 75 K and 1 Tesla, the HTS wire carries lc of 114 A/cm-width and 178<br>
A/cm-wicfth with the field perpendicular and parallel to the sample surface,<br>
TV'<br>
respectively. This represents an anisotropy of about 1.5.<br>
