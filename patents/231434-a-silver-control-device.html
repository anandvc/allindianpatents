				<td>Revolving plate for card sliver depositing equipments<br>
specially at drawing frames cards and the equivalent<br>
The invention refers to a revolving plate for card sliver<br>
depositing equipments specially at drawing frames, cards<br>
and the equivalent with a spatially curved sliver<br>
passage with an inlet and an outlet for card sliver, in<br>
which the inlet is assembled close or coaxially to the<br>
rotating axis and the outlet is assembled in radial and<br>
axial distance to the inlet, whereon the running card<br>
sliver is subjected to a tension drafting through the<br>
card sliver, between the running card sliver and the<br>
internal wall of sliver passage a relative movement is<br>
present, an abrasion resistance affects the internal<br>
wall of sliver passage.<br>
In the operational practice the card sliver in sliver<br>
passage is exposed to multiple number of movement - and<br>
force influences. Between delivery rollers and moving<br>
cans the card sliver experiences a certain straining<br>
draft, a tensile force works through which the card<br>
sliver is moved from inlet upto outlet through the<br>
sliver passage. Through it, that the outlet is assembled<br>
in axial distance to inlet, following the rotational<br>
movement in sidewise direction additionally a<br>
centrifugal force operates toward outside on the card<br>
sliver, which can lead to an undesired wrong draft over<br>
a "swelling". The centrifugal force working towards<br>
outside is counter acted through reduction of distance<br>
of bent sliver passage to the rotational axis that means<br>
the "swelling" is reduced wherein the internal wall<br>
exerts a counter acting force on the card sliver. The<br>
counter acting force brings up an increased friction<br><br>
of stiver materials with the internal wall, through which the sliver running<br>
speed is impaired and also wrong drafts caused through friction are not to<br>
be excluded. It was proposed to build up a revolving plate for delivery<br>
speed of up to 1000 m/min with a bent silver passage out of polished alloy<br>
steel. It has however shown that in this way a maintainable increase of<br>
sliver running speed about 1000 m/min is not possible Particularly in<br>
sensitive drafting slivers high frictional forces against the internal wall lead<br>
to undesired wrong drafts.<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of the invention, to provide a<br>
revolving plate of the type described at the entry, which avoids the<br>
mentioned disadvantages which makes possible specially an improved<br>
tape guide and quality.<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a stiver control device<br>
comprising:<br>
a cotter plate for depositing a sliver subjected to a tension draft in a silver<br>
coil, the coiler plate having a rotational axis and comprising:<br>
a spatially curved sliver channel having a wall, an inside wall surface, a<br>
sliver inlet and sliver outlet, the sliver inlet being arranged substantially<br>
coaxial with the rotational axis, and<br>
the silver outlet being arranged at a radial distance and an axial distance<br>
from the sliver inlet; and<br>
a friction reducer, the friction reducer having a drive control for<br>
coordinating a tensioning draft upstream from the sliver channel and a<br><br>
movement of a sliver can downstream from the sliver channel such that<br>
the stiver is positioned away from at least a portion of the sliver channel<br>
inside wall surface,<br>
wherein a relative movement exists between the silver and the inside wall<br>
surface of the sliver channel, and<br>
the friction reducer facilitates the relative movement by eliminating at least<br>
a portion of a frictlonal resistance acting on the silver through the inside<br>
wall surface.<br>
The measures as per invention considered different movement and force<br>
effects from the and on the card silver in the Internal space of sliver<br>
passage. The acting forces do not appear at all sides in same proportion.<br>
Through it, through change of inter action and/or of spatial allocation<br>
between card stiver and internal wall, undesired or rather disturbing forces<br>
can be partially and individually counter acted. In this way essentially an<br>
improved tape guide and-quality is attained and it makes possible a very<br>
remarkable Increase of sliver running speed of about 1000 m/min,<br>
particularly in drawing frame. In same measures the improved tape guide<br>
as per invention makes possible an improvement of sliver quality also in<br>
sliver running speed under 1000 m/mln., particularly in cards. The card<br>
sliver is mainly uniform, namely in relation to the draft in it's different<br>
sections or rather areas. The part drafts and with it their effect on the<br>
section or rather areas of card sliver in sliver passage are uniformly<br>
improved and the tension drafting In totality is improved. The<br>
advantageous further developments of invention are claimed<br>
subsequently.<br><br>
The Invention is explained closer followingly with the help of<br>
diagramatically represented execution example.<br>
It shows:<br>
Fig. 1	Schematic side view of a drawing frame with the revolving<br>
plate as per Invention.<br>
Fig. 2	Schematic side view of a card with the revolving plate as per<br>
Invention.<br>
Fig. 3a the revolving plate with sliver passage as per Figure 1 in<br>
section.<br>
Fig. 3b Side view of sliver passage with card sliver in section.<br>
Fig. 3c	Plan view on the sliver passage.<br>
The side view as per Fig. 1 shows (partly) the inlet area 1, the<br>
measurement area 2, the drafting device 3 and the sliver deposit 4 of a<br>
drawing frame as for example struetzschier-drawing frame HSR., In inlet<br>
area 1 spinning cans (round cans) of a drawing frame with two can rows<br>
below the sliver feed table 6 (creel) are assembled and the feed slivers<br>
are pulled off over feed rollers and delivered to the drafting device 3. After<br>
the passing of drafting device 3, the stretched card sliver gets in a<br>
revolving pate 10 of a can cotter and<br><br>
is deposited in rings in the exit can 11. In the<br>
revolving plate 10 a sliver passage 12, as for example a<br>
bent pipe is assembled through which the card sliver 9<br>
runs through. With A the working direction of the<br>
drawing frame is denoted. With 17a, 17b calendar rolls<br>
are denoted.<br>
Figure 2 shows a card, as for example Truetzschler-high<br>
capacity card DK 903, with feed roll, feed table,<br>
licker-in, drum, doffing cylinder stripping roller:<br>
squeezer rolls, non woven fleece guide item web trumpet,<br>
draw box, revolving flat with flat rods, cans 11 and can<br>
coiler 20. The direction of rotation of rolls are shown<br>
with bent arrows. With B the working direction of the<br>
card is denoted. Above the can coiler cover plate a<br>
housing is located, in which a rotating revolving plate<br>
10 is located. The can 11 is moved during the filling<br>
with card sliver 19 through the revolving plate 10<br>
through a (not represented) drive equipment. In the<br>
revolving plate 10 the sliver passage 12 as for example<br>
a bent pipe is assembled through which the card sliver<br>
13 runs through.<br>
As per Figure 3a the sliver passage 12 is spatially curved<br>
and shows an inlet 12a and an outlet 12b for card sliver<br>
9 (see Figure 3b). The inlet 12a is coaxially assembled<br>
to the rotational axis 16 and the outlet 12b is<br>
assembled in radial distance a and in axial distance b<br>
to the outlet 12a. The revolving plate 10 is assembled<br>
in an opening of stationary plate 14. The revolving<br>
plate 10 shows between the sliver entry opening 12a and<br>
the sliver exit opening 12b a tape guide passage 12b, as<br>
for example a bent pipe. The sliver exit opening 12b,<br>
which is located in the lower revolving top plate shows<br>
somewhat an elliptical shape. The card sliver 9 moves in<br>
sliver passage 12 in direction of arrow and enters the<br>
can 11 through the sliver exit opening 12b (see also<br>
Figure 1). With 15a, 15b ball bearings are denoted.<br><br>
The card sliver 9 is subjected to a light tension<br>
drafting in sliver passage 12 that means a tensile force Z<br>
operates. During entry the sliver card 9 follows the<br>
bendings of sliver passage 9. Following these bendings and<br>
the tensile force the sliver card 9 exerts in the areas<br>
x and y pressure - or rather friction forces P1 and P2<br>
on the internal wall 12c of sliver passage as at the<br>
remaining places of internal wall 12. Between the<br>
running sliver card and the internal wall 12c a relative<br>
movement is present.<br>
The friction resistance between sliver card 9 and the internal<br>
wall 12c is reduced as per invention through change of<br>
interaction and/or the spatial allocation between sliver<br>
card 9 and internal wall 12c of sliver passage 12. The<br>
"critical" areas x and y of internal wall 12c are<br>
therein of substantial meaning. Thus the friction<br>
between card sliver 9 and the areas x and y of internal<br>
wall 12c can be reduced through reduction of<br>
co-efficient of friction µ, through reduction of<br>
angle of friction α and/or through enlargement<br>
of radius of curvature r. Also the tension draft,<br>
which is determined through the draw boxes 17a, 17b and<br>
the speed of can 11, can be changed (Tensile force Z).<br>
Through these measures individually or in combination the<br>
contact force P1 and P2 are reduced.<br>
The sliver delivery takes place through the revolving<br>
plate 10, which has the assignment, to deposit cycloidal<br>
the finisher sliver 9 or rather 13 of sliver building<br>
machine in the spinning can 14. The cycloid arises<br>
through super imposition of two rotational movements,<br>
one quicker, executed through the revolving plate 10 and<br>
slower, executed through the can 11 (in the case of<br>
rectangular can the second movement is a translation).<br>
In the deposit process the sliver in pipe 12 is exposed<br>
to different forces. The force of gravity, the<br>
centrifugal force, the prestress force act through the<br><br>
operating tension draft as well as the friction force<br>
between sliver 9 and pipe internal wall 12c which is<br>
oppositely directed to the direction of movement of<br>
sliver 9 and through it hampers the deposit process. In<br>
order to obtain clean pull-off conditions, the tension<br>
draft is so proportioned that the sliver in pipe 12<br>
always lies under some strain. It puts up though here in<br>
the curved areas of pipe 12 always at the convex curved,<br>
smaller internal radius of each curvature bend.<br>
The above mentioned frictional force arises mainly<br>
through the interactions between sliver and pipe in this<br>
contact zones x and y. The described negative influences<br>
on the machine running condition and the sliver quality<br>
are determined above all through this friction between<br>
the card sliver 9 and the internal wall 12c of the<br>
laying pipe 12.<br>
For improvement of tape guide in revolving plate 12<br>
following actions are taken up individually or in<br>
combined form.<br>
Reduction of friction level between the fibre material<br>
and the internal surface of tape guide attachment, in<br>
which this is layered segmentwise or is executed out of<br>
friction poor material. In this way, as for example the<br>
tension draft can be decreased and consequently the<br>
wrong drafts are reduced.<br>
The geometry of tape guide attachment is redesigned in<br>
such a way that an unwinding of fibre materials is<br>
avoided over the circumference of tape guide attachment.<br>
The geometry of tape guide attachment 12 is expanded<br>
particularly in inlet area 12a. Consequently as for<br>
example the contact of card sliver 9 or rather 10 with<br>
the tape guide attachment 12 under the influence of<br>
tension is minimised.<br><br>
External forces are brought upon card sliver 9 or rather<br>
10 (as for example through generation of a magnetic or<br>
electric field). Through here as for example the<br>
friction between fibres and fibre guiding equipment 12c<br>
are reduced.<br>
The sliver load fluctuations caused through the sliver<br>
deposit are equalised through a controlled drive., for<br>
example of the can.<br>
The tape guide length is reduced through suitable design<br>
of revolving plate guide attachment.<br>
The tape guide attachment 12 shows other than round<br>
execution shapes (as for example elliptical). The<br>
measures for reduction of averaging in the tape guide<br>
attachments can be applied in drawing frames, cards,<br>
combing operations.<br><br>
