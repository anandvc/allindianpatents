				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of stable aqueous solution of risperidone for oral administration.<br>
US Patent No. 4,804, 663 discloses an oral solution containing a 1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl derivative, preservatives, tartaric acid, sodium-saccharin, flavors, and the polyhydric alcohols such as sorbitol and glycerol.<br>
However, comparable solutions wherein the benzisoxazole derivative was risperidone, were found to exhibit an unsatisfactory physicochemical stability. And, sorbitol was found to cause decomposition of risperidone upon storage of the solution at elevated temperatures. A similar observation was made with the maltitol, suggesting that risperidone is incompatible with polyhydric alcohols.<br>
Due to this incompatibility of risperidone with sorbitol, US Pat. Nos. 5,453,425 and 5,616,587 disclose an aqueous solution of risperidone essentially free of polyhydric alcohols such as mannitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose and the like.<br>
Use of polyhydric alcohols, including sorbitol as a sweetener has many advantages, as these provide bulk and sweetness with a clean, cool pleasant taste. Sorbitol provides one-third fewer calories than sugar. It is an excellent humectant, texturizing and anti-crystallizing agent. Moreover Polyhydric alcohols are resistant to metabolism by oral bacteria, which break down sugars, and starches to release acids that may lead to cavities or erode tooth enamel. They are, therefore, non-cariogenic.<br><br>
Sorbitol is slowly absorbed, therefore, when sorbitol is used, the rise in blood glucose and the insulin response associated with the ingestion of glucose is significantly reduced. Therefore Sorbitol can be used as an alternative to sugar for people with diabetes.<br>
Moreover, Sorbitol has been affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved for use by the European Union and numerous countries around the world, including Australia, Canada and Japan.<br>
Sorbitol is very stable, chemically inert and can withstand high temperatures. Moreover, the commercially available risperidone aqueous solution "Risperdal" needs to be diluted with 100ml of beverage before consuming. However polyhydric alcohol such as sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, sucrose, and maltose when used as bulk sweeteners give palatable aqueous solution, which can be administered as such.without any dilution.<br>
Hence, in view of the above advantages of polyhydric alcohols, it would be desirable to develop a method for stabilization of aqueous solution of risperidone containing polyhydric alcohols as sweeteners.<br>
In the present invention, we have discovered that a stable aqueous solution of risperidone can be prepared even with polyhydric alcohols. By experimentation in our lab, we have discovered that a stable aqueous solution of risperidone containing polyhydric alcohols can be prepared by reducing the solid content and increasing the available water concentration of the aqueous solution. US Patent No. 4,804, 663 describes the aqueous solution of risperidone with less than 30% average available water content and solid content up to about 70%. However we found<br><br>
that by reducing the solid content up to 10% and increasing the water content up to 90%, a stable aqueous solution of risperidone can be obtained. This solution was stable when kept for 4 weeks at a temperature of 80°C. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of stable aqueous solution of risperidone for oral administration comprising:<br>
a.	risperidone such as herein described,<br>
b.	stabilizing amount of antioxidant such as herein described,<br>
c.	polyhydric alcohol as sweetener such as herein described, and<br>
d.	buffering agent such as herein described, to maintain the pH of the said solution<br>
within the range of about 2 to about 4. <br>
e.other  conversional ingredients when on herein described 	<br>
 It also provides a method for the preparation of stable aqueous solution of risperidone comprising polyhydric alcohols as sweeteners, wherein the solution further comprises stabilizing amount of antioxidants.<br>
The solution prepared by the method of the present invention showed excellent stability and palatability and could be used without any further dilution.<br>
The term "stable" as herein defined refers to a solution wherein, after storage for a period uprtb 4 weeks at a temperature of 80° C or below, the residual amount of risperidone is 80% or more of the initial risperidone concentration.<br>
The term risperidone (3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1, 2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-tetr ahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one ) as used herein comprises the free base form<br>
and        the        pharmaceutically        acceptable        acid        addition        salts        thereof. The amount of risperidone in the present compositions ranges from 0.01 % to 1 %.<br>
The term polyhydric alcohols include monosaccharides such as glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose); disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose; other sugars such as ribose, glycerine, sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, erythritol, inositol, lactitol monohydrate, propylene glycol, galactose, mannose, xylose, rhamnose, glutaraldehyde, invert sugars, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol or mixtures thereof. The preferred sweeteners are sucrose and sorbitol that can be used in an amount of about 5 % to about 50% by weight of the total weight of solution.<br>
The antioxidants for the present invention may be selected from any of the three classes of antioxidant i.e. true antioxidants, reducing agents and antioxidant synergist. The true antioxidants may be selected from the group consisting of acetylcysteine, alpha tocopherol acetate, d- alpha tocopherol, dl- alpha tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole(BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), cysteine, cysteine hydrochloride, propyl gallate and the like. The reducing agents may be selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, calicum ascorbate, calcium bisulphite, calcium sulphite, isoascorbic acid, potassium metabisulphite, sodium ascorbate, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, sodium sulphite, sodium thiosulphate, thioglycerol and the like. The antioxidant synergists may be selected from the group consisting of citric acid, edetic acid (EDTA) and its salts such as disodium EDTA, hydroxyquinoline sulphate, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, tartaric acid and the like.<br>
Antioxidants, which are safe for ingestion and have sufficient solubility in the solution to make a stable single-phase composition, stable over a wide range of temperatures and pH values,<br>
Compatible with other components of the solution are preferred. Mixtures of two or more of the foregoing may also be used. The concentration of antioxidant may vary from about 0.01% to about 5.0% by weight of the total weight of solution.<br>
The term "stabilizing amount" as used herein refers to an amount of antioxidants, which is sufficient to stabilize the risperidone solution.<br>
Besides the above the oral solution of the present invention may also comprise of some other pharmaceutical additives such as antimicrobial preservatives, buffering agents, solubilizers, viscosity enhancing agents, colors, flavors and the like. The preservatives of the present invention may be selected from benzoic acid, sorbic acid, methyl paraben or salts thereof, propyl paraben or salts thereof, benzyl alcohol and benzylalkonium chloride. The concentration of the preservatives may range from 0.05% to 2%.<br>
Suitable solubilizer of the present invention may be a co-solvent, complexing agent, surfactant, wetting agent or the like.<br>
Viscosity enhancing agents of the present invention may be selected from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (some forms of which are available from Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich. USA under the METHOCEL trademark), hydroxpropyl cellulose and the like to provide a viscous mouth-feel similar to that of a traditional syrup.<br>
