				<td>METHOD FOR RECOVERING RARE METALS IN A ZINC LEACHING<br>
PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sulphidic zinc concentrate usually also includes small amounts of rare<br>
metals such as indium and gallium. If the content of these metals in the raw<br>
material is sufficiently high, their recovery may be economically worthwhile.<br>
In the method according to the invention the recovery of indium and other<br>
desirable rare metals takes place in a zinc leaching process, in which at least<br>
part of the sulphidic concentrate is leached directly without roasting.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional method for treating a sulphidic zinc concentrate is<br>
concentrate roasting, in which the sulphidic concentrate is roasted into zinc<br>
oxide and the iron in the concentrate forms chiefly zinc ferrite. Zinc oxide<br>
dissolves fairly easily, so that in the first stage the calcine is subjected to<br>
leaching, which is called neutral leaching. Zinc ferrite remains undissolved in<br>
neutral leaching and in order to recover this zinc from the ferrite a strong acid<br>
leaching is often used. Zinc ferrite residue also contains the ferric iron<br>
residue precipitated in neutral leaching. Ferric iron residue for its part<br>
contains in addition to ferric hydroxide co-precipitated aluminium hydroxide<br>
and rare metals, such as gallium and indium. The ferrite residue can also be<br>
fed into a Waelz kiln, in which the zinc is evaporated, and is then oxidised<br>
into zinc oxide and fed back into the leaching process. Waelz oxide can also<br>
bs treated in a separate process step for the sake of recovering the other co-<br>
precipitated metals such as indium.<br>
Nowadays the trend is more and more towards processes, in which at least<br>
part of the sulphidic zinc concentrate is fed into leaching without roasting.<br>
This enables the treatment of impure and fine-grained concentrates. A direct<br>
leaching process for zinc sulphide concentrate can be carried out in both<br>
atmospheric and pressure leaching processes. However, zinc sulphide<br><br>
leaching requires a far higher acid concentration than that used in the neutral<br>
leaching of a calcine, but because the fabrication of elemental zinc nearly<br>
always occurs electrolytically, the spent acid from electrolysis can be used in<br>
concentrate leaching. Zinc ferrite leaching requires the highest acid<br>
concentration of all. Sulphide concentrate leaching can be combined with a<br>
process in which the leaching of ferrites formed in roasting occurs as a<br>
strong acid leach and thus the leaching of ferrites is performed in connection<br>
with concentrate leaching. In that case a counter-current leaching process is<br>
used, where in addition to a strong acid leaching stage enabling zinc ferrite<br>
leaching there is also a weak acid leaching stage. A significant portion of<br>
concentrate leaching occurs for its part even in the weak acid leaching stage.<br>
These types of methods are described for instance in US patents 6,475,450,<br>
5,858,315 and 6,340,450 and in WO publication 2004/076698.<br>
Zinc concentrate may contain rare metals such as indium and gallium, which<br>
it is desirable to recover. One possible method to implement the recovery of<br>
these metals is the processing of neutral leaching leachate in a Waelz kiln<br>
into Waeiz oxide and the leaching of this oxide, whereupon the metals<br>
ending up in the oxide are made to return to the solution and are further<br>
recovered in liquid-liquid extraction. This kind of indium and gallium recovery<br>
in connection with a Waelz oxide leaching process is known in the prior art.<br>
This process is assisted by the fact that these metais have already enriched<br>
the Waelz oxide, because they are co-precipitated with ferric hydroxide in<br>
neutral leaching. In accordance with the method the zinc oxide that contains<br>
a valuable metal is leached by means of sulphuric acid, whereupon the<br>
metals and the zinc dissolve and the lead and silver plus other inert<br>
compounds in the oxide remain in the residue. The solution is routed to<br>
indium extraction, where indium is separated from the zinc, and the zinc<br>
sulphate solution is routed to the neutral leaching step. If the concentrate<br>
contains gallium, its recovery takes place in principle during indium recovery,<br>
whereupon indium and gallium are separated into their own phases.<br><br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
When direct concentrate leaching without roasting is linked at least partially<br>
to zinc recovery from sulphide concentrate there is no method currently by<br>
which indium and other desired rare metals are recovered from concentrate<br>
entering direct leaching and the resulting solution. The biggest problem with<br>
the recovery of these metals is the solution exiting direct leaching that<br>
contains rare metals is in practice unsuitable in composition for the<br>
conventional recovery processes of these metals.<br>
The method according to the invention enables the recovery of at least one<br>
of the rare metals contained in the concentrate, such as indium and gallium,<br>
in connection with the direct leaching of zinc sulphide concentrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE. INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached<br>
claims.<br>
The invention relates to a method of recovering at least one rare metal, such<br>
as indium and/or gallium in connection with the leaching of zinc sulphide<br>
concentrate. The zinc sulphate solution generated in concentrate leaching,<br>
which contains iron and rare metals, is routed to a neutralization and<br>
precipitation stage, where the solution is neutralized to a pH area of 2.5 - 3.5<br>
to precipitate the trivalent iron in the solution and to co-precipitate at least<br>
one rare metal with the iron.<br>
The amount of trivalent iron in the zinc sulphate solution is regulated to be 5<br>
- 10% of the amount of iron in solution, corresponding to the amount needed<br>
to precipitate at least one rare metal of those to be co-precipitated from the<br>
solution.<br>
If required the zinc sulphate solution is oxidized in the neutralization and<br>
precipitation stage to form a sufficient amount of trivalent iron. The solution<br><br>
neutralization is carried out with at least one or more neutralizing agents from<br>
the following group: Waelz oxide, calcine, sodium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide, calcium oxide and ammonia.<br>
The precipitate of iron and at least one rare metal that is formed is routed to<br>
the leaching stage to leach the rare metal and on to recovery by means of<br>
extraction. As the ferric iron content of the solution is too high for the<br>
extraction step, it is preferable to reduce some of the ferric iron back to<br>
divalent with some suitable substance acting as reducing agent, which is at<br>
least one of the group: zinc sulphide concentrate, hydrogen sulphide and<br>
sodium sulphide.<br>
LIST OF DRAWINGS<br>
The method according to the invention is depicted in the attached flow sheet<br>
1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for the recovery of at least one rare metal<br>
in connection with zinc sulphide concentrate leaching. The most common<br>
rare metal in zinc sulphide concentrate is indium. Gallium behaves in<br>
leaching largely in the same way as indium and so if it is in the concentrate, it<br>
can also be recovered if desired at the same time. The third possibie rare<br>
metal in a zinc raw material is germanium, but it behaves partly in a different<br>
way than gallium and indium in the zinc process due to its higher oxidation<br>
degree and requires its own kind of process.<br>
As the invention is depicted in the attached flow sheet 1, only indium out of<br>
the rare metals is marked for the sake of simplicity, but the method also<br>
relates to other rare metals such as gallium. The zinc sulphide concentrate 1<br>
leaching step 2 generally takes place in an acid concentration of 10 - 50 g/l<br>
of sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid solution is generally the spent acid from<br>
electrolysis concentrated if necessary with sulphuric acid. In addition,<br><br>
oxygen-containing gas is fed into the solution such as air, oxygen-enriched<br>
air or oxygen. When part of the concentrate is roasted, the ferrite-containing<br>
ieach residue 3 that remained undissolved in the calcine neutral leaching<br>
stage can also be fed into the concentrate leaching step, if there is no<br>
separate acid leaching stage for the neutral leach leaching residue in. the<br>
zinc process. Another alternative is that the ferrite residue is fed into a Waelz<br>
kiln. These familiar stages, in which part of the concentrate is roasted and<br>
routed subsequently to a neutral leaching step, are not presented in detail in<br>
the diagram.<br>
The sulphide concentrate leaching stage 2 generally consists of several<br>
reactors and where what is termed a concurrent leaching process is<br>
concerned, it is preferable to regulate it so that the acid concentration is<br>
highest in the first reactor and decreases in the following reactors. If the<br>
leaching residue from the neutral leach is also fed into the direct leaching<br>
process, it is more advantageous to use a counter-current leaching process,<br>
which includes weak acid and strong acid leaching steps.<br>
Concentrate leaching results in a zinc sulphate solution 4 and a sediment of<br>
leaching residue precipitate 5, which mainly contains the lead, silver and<br>
other precious metals in the concentrate as well as silica compounds, any<br>
gypsum that may have precipitated and elemental sulphur. The zinc sulphate<br>
solution 4 also includes the dissolved iron and rare metals of the<br>
concentrate, such as indium and gallium. Iron is mainly in divalent form, but<br>
the leaching conditions are regulated so that 5-10% of the iron is trivalent i.e.<br>
in ferric form, so that its amount corresponds to the amount required in the<br>
precipitation of at least one rare metal to be precipitated from the solution.<br>
The aim is, however, to minimise the amount of ferric iron in solution,<br>
because it accompanies the indium and hinders the production of a pure<br>
indium product. It is possible to regulate the ferric iron concentration of the<br>
solution already at the leaching stage, but if necessary fine-tuning can be<br>
done by increasing the ferric iron concentration in the neutralization step with<br><br>
separate oxidants, such as oxygen, manganese dioxide and potassium<br>
permanganate.<br>
The solution containing zinc sulphate 4 exiting zinc sulphide concentrate<br>
leaching is routed according to the invention to neutralization and<br>
precipitation stage 6, in which the trivalent iron contained in the solution is<br>
precipitated out, whereupon the desired rare metals are also co-precipitated<br>
with the iron. Solution neutralization is performed with some appropriate<br>
neutralising agent. If the process includes concentrate roasting,<br>
neutralization can be carried out with the calcine. If the process includes<br>
ferrite reduction in a Waelz kiln, the use of Waelz oxide for neutralization is<br>
especially advantageous, since there are no ferrites in Waelz oxide and<br>
therefore no zinc losses are generated. If the process is not connected to<br>
concentrate roasting, it is preferable to perform neutralization with some kind<br>
of neutralizing agent that dissolves completely. These are for instance<br>
sodium hydroxide NaOH or ammonia NH3 and at least part of the<br>
neutralization can be done with calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide.<br>
The pH of the solution is raised to the range of 2.5 - 3.5 by means of<br>
neutralization, whereupon trivaient iron is precipitated, as are indium and the<br>
other desired rare metals. The pH should be regulated in the neutralization<br>
and precipitation stage to the correct range, so that impurities for the indium<br>
process, such as iron, are not precipitated too much with it, and likewise for<br>
zinc. The purpose is that only iron in trivalent form should be precipitated and<br>
the rest of the iron removed in a separate iron precipitation step. If the<br>
amount of trivalent iron in the solution is insufficient for the precipitation of<br>
indium and the other desired rare metals, the solution can be oxidised to<br>
form ferric iron. Suitable oxidants are the familiar oxidants mentioned above,<br>
such as oxygen, manganese dioxide and potassium permanganate.<br>
The neutralization and precipitation stage generates a deposit 7, which<br>
contains the indium and other rare metals of the concentrate that co-<br><br>
precipitated with the iron. The deposit obtained is treated using the prior art,<br>
so that the deposit is leached in leaching step 8 using a solution containing<br>
sulphuric acid. The solution may be a sulphuric acid solution or electrolysis<br>
spent acid. The solution obtained 9, which includes rare metals, ferric iron<br>
and a little zinc, is routed to liquid-liquid extraction 10 to separate the indium<br>
and other rare metals from impurities. If the ferric iron content in this solution<br>
is too high for the economic operation of the extraction stage, the ferric iron<br>
can be reduced back, for example with zinc concentrate or with a suitable<br>
reducing agent such as hydrogen sulphide or sodium sulphide. Extraction<br>
gives rise to a solution essentially free of zinc, from which the rare metals are<br>
recovered using some known method in itself to form an indium product. The<br>
leaching residue that precipitates in the leaching step 8 contains some lead<br>
and silver. Especially, if the neutralizing agent used in the neutralization and<br>
precipitation stage 6 is Waelz oxide, it contains lead, which precipitates from<br>
the solution.<br>
The solution of the neutralization and precipitation stage 6 is an iron-<br>
containing zinc sulphate solution 11, from which the iron is precipitated in its<br>
own precipitation step 12 in some appropriate way, typically as jarosite,<br>
goethite or hematite, and the zinc sulphate solution obtained is routed to the<br>
neutral leaching stage. The sulphate solution exiting indium extraction, which<br>
contains zinc, is routed via neutral leaching and solution purification to the<br>
electrolytic recovery of zinc, because the iron content in it is so small that it<br>
does not need to be fed via the iron removal step.<br>
The invention is described further by means of the example below:<br>
Example 1<br>
The indium recovery tests were divided into two stages: the precipitation of<br>
indium from the zinc sulphate solution produced in zinc concentrate leaching<br>
tests and the leaching of the precipitated deposit. The purpose of the<br>
leaching stage is to produce a good solution for the further recovery of<br><br>
indium using liquid-liquid extraction. The execution of the method will<br>
become apparent from the appended examples.<br>
Indium precipitation:<br>
1 litre of zinc sulphate solution containing indium was heated to a<br>
temperature of 75°C agitated reactor made of glass. The mixing rate in the<br>
reactor was regulated so that the solids were kept in motion throughout the<br>
test. The pH of the solution at the beginning of the test was about 1.3 and the<br>
ferric iron concentration 2.3 g/l. After this the pH was raised to a value of 3.0<br>
by adding Waelz oxide (addition of 25.01 g), whereupon indium and some<br>
impurities (Al, Fe, Zn) began to precipitate. The test was continued for 6 h<br>
keeping the pH constant with small additions of Waelz oxide (a total addition<br>
throughout the whole test of 26.30 g) and samples of the slurry were taken<br>
after 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 6 h.<br>
The samples were filtered and the indium content of the solution was<br>
analysed. These results and the initial composition of the solution are<br>
presented below in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 initial composition of the test solution and the indium<br>
concentrations at different times of the precipitation test.<br><br><br>
The results show that indium precipitates effectively and quickly even in the<br>
first moments of the test. At the end of the test the total weight of the deposit<br>
was 17.72 g. 0.47 g of deposit was removed with the samples during the<br>
test.<br>
At the start of the test there was 83 mg of indium in the solution and about 5<br>
mg at the end of the test, in other words the precipitation percentage was<br>
about 93 %, taking into account the indium removed with the .samples.<br>
Leaching of the indium-containing deposit:<br>
The deposit precipitated in the previous stage was leached with a sulphuric<br>
acid solution with the purpose of producing a concentrated indium solution<br>
for the recovery of indium by means of liquid-liquid extraction, in the residue<br>
leaching test, 16.76 g of indium-containing deposit (In concentration 0.67%)<br>
from the previous precipitation stage was mixed into a dilute solution of<br>
sulphuric acid (0.5 I solution, of which the pH was 1.0 and the temperature<br>
95 °C) in an agitated reactor.<br>
The mixing rate in the glass agitated reactor was adjusted so that the solids<br>
remained in motion throughout the entire test. The test was continued for 8 h<br>
raising the acid concentration to a value of about 38 g/l at the 2 h point and<br>
then keeping it constant for the following 3 hours. The sulphuric acid<br>
concentration of the slurry was raised again to a value of 50 g/l at the 5 h<br>
point and kept constant for the next 3 h. Samples of the slurry were taken<br>
after 1 h, 2 h, 5 h and 8 h.<br>
The samples were filtered and the solution was analysed for indium content<br>
and that of the major impurities. These results and the composition of the<br>
solution at different times are presented below in Table 2. After leaching the<br>
mass of the final residue was 10.63 g and the In concentration 0.13 %. On<br>
the basis of the deposit analyses and their masses, the leaching yield of<br><br>
indium was about 88 %. In this case the indium yield percentage of the whole<br>
indium recovery process comes to around 82 %.<br>
Table 2 Composition and indium concentrations of the test solution at<br>
different points in the leaching test.<br><br>
The results show that a large part of the indium dissolves during the first two<br>
hours, when the pH of the solution is 1. Raising the acid content further<br>
improves indium recovery even more. It also shows that the solution is<br>
concentrated considerably with regard to indium, when we compare the<br>
concentrations of Al, Fe, and Zn to the indium concentrations in the initial<br>
solution of the precipitation test and in the final solution of the leaching test.<br><br>
