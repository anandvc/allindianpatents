SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A powertrain controller for a vehicle comprises a vehicle load<br>
estimation module, an adaptive power demand module, a throttle map<br>
module, and a transmission gearshift map module. The vehicle load<br>
estimation module generates a vehicle load index. The adaptive power<br>
demand module selects one of N mappings from pedal position to power<br>
demand based upon the vehicle load index and determines a power demand<br>
signal based upon a received pedal position signal and the selected one of<br>
the N mappings.<br>
[0005] The throttle map module selects one of P mappings from<br>
speed to throttle control based upon the power demand signal and determines<br>
a throttle control signal based upon a received speed signal and the selected<br>
one of the P mappings. The transmission gearshift map module selects one<br>
of Q mappings from vehicle speed to gear selection based upon the power<br>
demand signal and determines a gear control signal based upon a received<br>
vehicle speed signal and the selected one of the Q mappings. N, P, and Q<br>
are integers greater than one.<br>
[0006] In other features, the adaptive power demand module<br>
selects another one of the N mappings based upon the vehicle load index and<br>
determines the power demand signal based upon the pedal position signal<br>
and an interpolation of the selected one of the N mappings and the selected<br>
another one of the N mappings. The throttle map module selects another one<br>
of the P mappings based upon the power demand signal and determines the<br>
throttle control signal based upon the speed signal and an interpolation of the<br>
selected one of the P mappings and the selected another one of the P<br>
mappings.<br>
[0007] In further features, the transmission gearshift map module<br>
selects another one of the Q mappings based upon the power demand signal<br>
and determines the gear control signal based upon the vehicle speed signal<br>
and an interpolation of the selected one of the Q mappings and the selected<br>
another one of the Q mappings. The speed signal comprises a transmission<br><br>
3<br>
speed signal. The speed signal comprises the vehicle speed signal. The<br>
throttle map module includes S sets of N mappings from vehicle speed to<br>
throttle control, selects one of the S sets of N mappings based upon the gear<br>
control signal, and selects one of the N mappings from the selected one of the<br>
S sets of N mappings based upon the power demand signal.<br>
[0008] In still other features, the vehicle load estimation module<br>
generates the vehicle load index based upon at least one of incline, amount of<br>
towing load, wind resistance, payload, speed, altitude, and acceleration. The<br>
vehicle load estimation module generates the vehicle load index based upon<br>
a difference between measured acceleration of the vehicle and acceleration of<br>
the vehicle as predicted by engine torque. The pedal position signal is based<br>
upon a signal from an accelerator pedal of the vehicle.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B,<br>
and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-<br>
exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may<br>
be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
[0016] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or<br>
firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary engine system 200 according to the principles of the present<br>
disclosure is presented. The engine system 200 includes a plurality of<br>
sensors 202, such as a level sensor 202-1, a suspension deflection sensor<br>
202-2, an accelerometer 202-3, and an altitude sensor 202-4. The sensors<br>
202 may also include a throttle position sensor 202-5, a pedal position sensor<br>
202-6, a transmission speed sensor 202-7, and a vehicle speed sensor 202-8.<br>
[0018] Signals from the sensors 202 are received by a sensor input<br>
module 204. The sensor input module 204 may latch signals at specified<br>
times, convert analog signals to digital, and perform bounds checking on the<br>
signal values. A powertrain controller 206 receives sensor signals from the<br>
sensor input module 204. Based upon the sensor signals, the powertrain<br>
controller 206 communicates a gear selection signal to the transmission 106,<br>
a throttle position control signal to the electronic throttle control (ETC) motor<br>
110, and spark and fuel control signals to the engine 108.<br><br>
5<br>
[0019] Referring now to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary powertrain controller 300 according to the principles of the present<br>
disclosure is presented. The powertrain controller 300 includes a vehicle load<br>
estimation module 302, an adaptive power demand module 304, a throttle<br>
map module 306, and a transmission gearshift map module 308.<br>
[0020] The vehicle load estimation module 302 receives engine<br>
torque signals, vehicle speed signals, and/or other signals. Based upon these<br>
signals, the vehicle load estimation module 302 generates a vehicle load<br>
index, which is communicated to the adaptive power demand module 304.<br>
The vehicle load index is a measure of the load the vehicle is experiencing.<br>
[0021] The load may be affected by the incline the vehicle is<br>
traveling on, the weight of the vehicle, whether the vehicle is towing, wind<br>
resistance, etc. The vehicle load estimation module 302 can use sensor<br>
signals from the sensor input module 204 of FIG. 2 to determine a vehicle<br>
load index. The vehicle load estimation module 302 may estimate wind<br>
resistance based upon vehicle speed and may estimate angle of incline based<br>
on the measured angle of a sensor attached to the vehicle.<br>
[0022] The vehicle load estimation module 302 may estimate<br>
payload of the vehicle from suspension deflection sensors, may estimate<br>
altitude from an air pressure sensor, and may estimate vehicle acceleration<br>
from an accelerometer or a transmission speed reading. In various<br>
implementations, the vehicle load estimation module 302 may determine or<br>
adjust the vehicle load index based upon the difference between actual<br>
vehicle acceleration and acceleration predicted by current engine torque.<br>
Further description of the vehicle load estimation module 302 may be found in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Serial No. 11/459,703, filed July 25, 2006, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023] The adaptive power demand module 304 includes storage<br>
320 that stores one or more tables of power demand versus pedal position.<br>
Pedal position may be determined from signals from a pedal position sensor.<br>
Pedal position information may be modified by such sources as cruise control<br>
and traction control. A table is selected from storage 320 by the vehicle load<br>
index from the vehicle load estimation module 302.<br>
[0024] Values may be interpolated if the vehicle load index lies<br>
between multiple tables. For example, in various implementations storage<br>
320 includes four tables and the vehicle load index ranges from one to four.<br>
In this case, if a vehicle load index of 2.3 is received, the adaptive power<br>
demand module 304 may read power demand values from tables<br>
corresponding to vehicle load indices of two and three.<br>
[0025] The adaptive power demand module 304 may then<br>
interpolate between the two power demand values using a straight line. A<br>
straight line interpolation for the above example would be to add thirty percent<br>
of the difference between a value from tables two and three to the value from<br>
table two. A non-linear curve or best fit line may be employed if power<br>
demand values from additional tables are included. The resulting power<br>
demand value is communicated to the throttle map module 306 and to the<br>
transmission gearshift map module 308.<br>
[0026] The throttle map module 306 includes storage 322 that<br>
stores one or more tables corresponding to a plot of throttle position versus<br>
transmission speed. In various implementations, storage 322 may store<br>
functions that embody the relationship between throttle position and<br>
transmission speed instead of storing pre-calculated tables. The throttle map<br>
module 306 selects one of the tables based upon the power demand signal<br>
from the adaptive power demand module 304.<br><br>
7<br>
[0027] The throttle map module 306 may interpolate when the<br>
power demand signal falls between two tables within storage 322. The<br>
throttle map module 306 determines a throttle position control signal from the<br>
selected table or tables based on transmission input speed. The throttle map<br>
module 306 communicates the throttle position control signal to the ETC<br>
motor 110 of FIG. 2.<br>
[0028] If the throttle map module 306 receives vehicle speed<br>
instead of transmission speed, the throttle map module may include a plurality<br>
of sets of tables, each corresponding to a different gear or gear ratio. A gear<br>
signal may be received from the transmission gearshift map module 308 to<br>
select one of the sets of tables; no interpolation is necessary because the<br>
gear signal will be an integer. The transmission gearshift map module 308<br>
includes storage 324 that stores one or more tables containing a mapping<br>
from vehicle speed to a gear control signal.<br>
[0029] The transmission gearshift map module 308 selects a table<br>
from storage 324 based upon the received power demand signal. The<br>
transmission gearshift map module 308 may interpolate If the power demand<br>
signal falls between two tables. Based upon the vehicle speed, the<br>
transmission gearshift map module 308 will output a gear control signal to the<br>
transmission 106 of FIG. 2. The gear control signal may also be<br>
communicated to the throttle map module 306.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 4, graphical representations of<br>
exemplary input/output relationships stored in equation and/or tabular form by<br>
storage 320, storage 322, and/or storage 324 are presented. A first chart 402<br>
depicts exemplary mappings from pedal position (such as pedal position) to<br>
power demand for an adaptive power demand module, such as the adaptive<br>
power demand module 304 of FIG. 3. In the first chart 402, four mappings are<br>
shown, corresponding to four different vehicle load indices.<br><br>
8<br>
[0031] A second chart 404 depicts exemplary mappings from<br>
transmission speed to throttle position for a throttle map module, such as the<br>
throttle map module 306 of FIG. 3. The second chart 404 includes four<br>
mappings, corresponding to four different power demand signals. A third<br>
chart 406 depicts exemplary mappings from vehicle speed to gear control for<br>
a transmission gearshift map module, such as the transmission gearshift map<br>
module 308 of FIG-. 3.<br>
[0032] The third chart 406 includes four mappings, corresponding to<br>
four values of the power demand signal. These input/output relationships<br>
may be established during design of the engine, and may be modified during<br>
calibration. Additionally, the input/output relationships may be modified by the<br>
powertrain controller 300 while driving to improve fuel economy.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes<br>
particular examples, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited<br>
since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon<br>
a study of the drawings, the specification and the following claims.<br><br>
