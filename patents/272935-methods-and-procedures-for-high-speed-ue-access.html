METHODS AND PROCEDURES FOR HIGH SPEED UE ACCESS<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Solution<br>
[1]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/889,520 filed on February 12, 2007, the contents of which is hereby incoiporated<br>
by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
[2]	The present invention is dii-ected to a mobile terminal random access procedure for<br>
obtaining uplink time synchronization and access to a network and specifically to an apparatus and method that allows a mobile terminal to correctly map signature indexes onto cyclic shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences when the deployed cells support a high-speed mobility by informing a mobile terminal whether a cell supports high-speed mobility.<br>
[3]	A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a European-type, third<br>
generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). UMTS is intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based upon a GSM core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless connection technology. In December 1998, a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) was formed by the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the Tl of the United States, and the TTA of Korea. The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of UMTS technology.<br>
[4]	In order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the UMTS, five<br>
technical specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP for stand¬ardizing the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network elements and 'their operations. Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification<br>
within a related region. The radio access network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops the standai-ds for the functions, requirements, and interface of the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[5]	FIG. 1 provides an ovei-view of a UMTS network. The UMTS network includes a<br>
mobile terminal or user equipment (UE) 1, a UTRAN 2 and a core network (CN) 3.<br>
[6]	The UTRAN 2 includes several radio network controllers (RNCs) 4 and NodeBs 5<br>
that are connected via the I„b interface. Each RNC 4 controls several NodeBs 5. Each NodeB 5 controls one or several cells, where a cell covers a given geographical area on   a given frequency.<br><br>
[7j	Each RNC 4 is connected via the lu interface to the CN 3 or towards the mobile<br>
switching center (MSC) 6 entity of the CN and the general packet radio sei-vice<br>
(GPRS) support Node (SGSN) 7 entity. RNCs 4 can be connected to other RNCs via<br>
the lur interface. The RNC 4 handles the assignment and management of radio<br>
resources and operates as an access point with respect to the CN 3.<br>
[8]	The NodeBs 5 receive infonnation sent by the physical layer of the UE 1 via an<br>
uplink and transmit data to the UE 1 via a downlink. The Node-Bs 5 operate as access<br>
points of the UTRAN 2 for the UE 1.<br>
[9]	The SGSN 7 is connected to the equipment identity register (EIR) 8 via the Gf<br>
interface, to the MSC 6 via the Gs interface, to the gateway GPRS support node<br>
(GGSN) 9 via the GN interface, and to the home subscriber server (HSS) via the GR<br>
interface.<br>
[ 10]	The EIR 8 hosts hsts of UEs 1 that ai-e allowed to be used on the network. The EIR 8<br>
also hosts lists of UEs 1 that are not allowed to be used on the network.<br>
[11]	The MSC 6, which controls the connection for circuit switched (CS) sei-vices, is<br>
connected towards the media gateway (MGW) 11 via the ND interface, towai'ds the EIR<br>
8 via the F interface, and towards the HSS 10 via the D interface.<br>
[12]	The MGW 11 is connected towards the HSS 10 via the C interface and also to the<br>
public switched telephone network (PSTN). The MGW 11 also allows the codecs to<br>
adapt between the PSTN and the connected RAN.<br>
[13]	The GGSN 9 is connected to the HSS 10 via the GC interface and to the Internet via<br>
the GI interface. The GGSN 9 is responsible for routing, charging and separation of<br>
data flows into different radio access bearers (RABs). The HSS 10 handles the sub¬<br>
scription data of users.<br>
[14]	The UTRAN 2 constructs and maintains an RAB for communication between a UE 1<br>
and the CN 3. The CN 3 requests end-to-end quality of semce (QoS) requirements<br>
from the RAB and the RAB supports the QoS requirements set by the CN 3. Ac¬<br>
cordingly, the UTRAN 2 can satisfy the end-to-end QoS requirements by constructing<br>
and maintaining the RAB.<br>
[15]	The services provided to a specific UE 1 are roughly divided into CS services and<br>
packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general voice conversation service is a<br>
CS service and a Web browsing service via an Internet connection is classified as a PS<br>
service.<br>
[16]	The RNCs 4 ai-e connected to the MSC 6 of the CN 3 and the MSC is connected to<br>
the gateway MSC (GMSC) that manages the connection with other networks in order<br>
to support CS services. The RNCs 4 are connected to the SGSN 7 and the gateway<br>
GGSN 9 of the CN 3 to support PS sei-vices.<br>
[17]	The SGSN 7 supports packet communications with the RNCs. The GGSN 9 manages<br><br>
the connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[18]	FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between a UE 1 and the<br>
UTRAN 2 according to the 3GPP radio access network standai-ds. As illustrated In<br>
FIG. 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a physical layer, a<br>
data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising a user plane<br>
(U-plane) for ti-ansmitting user data and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting<br>
conti-ol infoiTnation. The U-plane is a region that handles traffic information with the<br>
user, such as voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The C-plane is a region that<br>
handles conti'ol infomiation for an interface with a network as well as maintenance and<br>
management of a call. The protocol layers can be divided into a first layer (LI), a<br>
second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open<br>
system interconnection (OSI) standard model.<br>
[19]	The fii-st layer (LI), or physical layer, provides an information transfer service to an<br>
upper layer by using vaiious radio transmission techniques. The physical layer is<br>
connected to an upper layer, or medium access conti'ol (MAC) layer, via a transport<br>
channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the transport<br>
channel.<br>
[20]	The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer. The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and<br>
transport channels and provides allocation of the MAC pai-ameters for allocation and<br>
re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer, or the<br>
radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[21]	Various logical channels ai-e provided according to the type of information<br>
transmitted. A control channel is generally used to transmit information of the C-plane<br>
and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the U-plane. A logical channel<br>
may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending on whether the logical<br>
channel is shared.<br>
[22]	FIG. 3 illustrates the different logical channels that exist. Logical channels include a<br>
dedicated traffic channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common<br>
traffic channel (CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control<br>
channel (BCCH), and a paging control channel (PCCH), or a Shared Control Channel<br>
(SCCH), as well as other channels. The BCCH provides information including in¬<br>
formation utihzed by a UE 1 to access a system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN 2<br>
to access a UE 1.<br>
[23]	Additional traffic and control channels are introduced in the Multimedia Broadcast<br>
Multicast Service (MBMS) standard for the purposes of MBMS. The MBMS point-to-multipoint control channel (MCCH) is used for transmission of MBMS control in-<br><br>
formation. The MBMS point-to-multipoint traffic channel (MTCH) is used for transmitting MBMS service data. The MBMS scheduUng channel (MSCH) is used to transmit scheduling infoimation.<br>
[24]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels. The MAC<br>
layer can be divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub¬layer, a MAC-hs sub-layer and a MAC-m sublayer according to the type of transport channel being managed.<br>
[25]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a broadcast channel (BCH), which is a transport<br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a common tiansport channel, such as a fbrwaid access channel (FACH) or a downlink shai-ed channel (DSCH), which is shai-ed by a plurality of UEs 1, or in the uplink the radio access channel (RACH). The MAC-m sublayer may handle MBMS data.<br>
[26]	FIG. 4 illustrates the possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport<br>
channels from a UE 1 perspective. FIG. 5 illustrates the possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UTRAN 2 perspective.<br>
j 27]	The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated<br>
transport channel for a specific UE 1. The MAC-d sublayer is located in a sei^ving RNC 4 (SRNC) that manages a corresponding UE 1. One MAC-d sublayer also exists in each UE 1.<br>
78]	The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions and perfoiins segmentation and<br>
concatenation on a plurality of RLC service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer depending of the RLC mode of operation. The RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU received from the upper layer in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity and then creates data units by adding header information. The data units, or protocol data units (PDUs), are transfeired to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and / or the RLC PDUs.<br>
29]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message ti-ansfeiTcd from the CN 3.<br>
The BMC layer broadcasts the CB message to UEs 1 positioned in a specific cell or cells.<br>
30]	The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to transmit<br>
network protocol data, such as the IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently on a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth. The PDCP layer reduces unnecessary control information used in a wired network, a function called header compression, for this puipose.<br>
31 ]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer<br>
(L3) is only defined in the C-plane, The RRC layer controls the transport channels and the physical channels in relation to setup, reconfiguration, and the release or can-<br><br>
cellation of the radio bearers (RBs).<br>
[32]	A RB signifies a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission<br>
between a UE 1 and the UTRAN 2. The set up of the RB generally refers to the<br>
process of stipulating the chai'acteristics of a protocol layer and a channel required for<br>
providing a specific data service and setting the respective detailed parameters and<br>
operation methods. The RRC also handles user mobility within the RAN and ad¬<br>
ditional services, such as location services.<br>
[33]	Not all different possibilities for the mapping between the RBs and the transport<br>
channels for a given UE 1 are available all the time. The UE 1 / UTRAN 2 deduce the<br>
possible mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure presently executed by<br>
the UE/UTRAN.<br>
[34]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. The<br>
configuration of the physical channels is given by RRC signaling exchanged between<br>
theRNC4andtheUEl.<br>
[35]	Initial access is a procedure whereby a UE 1 sends a first message to the UTRAN 2<br>
using a common uplink channel, specifically the Random Access Channel (RACH).<br>
For both GSM and UMTS systems, the initial access procedure involves the UE 1<br>
transmitting a connection request message that includes a reason for the request and<br>
receiving a response from the UTRAN 2 indicating the allocation of radio resources<br>
for the requested reason.<br>
[36]	There are several reasons, or establishment causes, for sending a connection request<br>
message. Table I indicates the establishment causes specified in UMTS, specifically in<br>
3GPPTS 25.331.<br>
[37]	The "originating call" establishment cause indicates that the UE 1 wants to setup a<br>
connection, for example, a speech connection. The "terminating call" establishment<br>
cause indicates that that UE 1 answers to paging. The "registration" establishment<br>
cause indicates that that the user wants to register only to the network.<br>
[38]	A physical random access procedure is used to send information over the air. The<br>
physical random access transmission is under control of a higher layer protocol, which<br>
performs important functions related to priority and load control. This procedure<br>
differs between GSM and UMTS radio systems.<br>
[39]	The description of GSM random access procedure can be found in "The GSM<br>
System for Mobile Communications" published by M. Mouly and M. B. Pautet, 1992.<br>
As the present invention is related to UMTS enhancement and evolution, the W-<br>
CDMA random access procedure is detailed herein. Although the present invention is<br>
explained in the context of UMTS evolution, the present invention is not so limited.<br>
[40]	The transport channel RACH and two physical channels. Physical Random Access<br>
Channel (PRACH) and Acquisition Indication Channel (AICH), are utilized in this<br><br>
procedure. The transport channels are channels supplied by the physical layer to the protocol layer of the MAC layer. There are several types of transport channels to transmit data with different properties and transmission fomriats over the physical layer.<br>
[41]	Physical channels ai'e identified by code and frequency in Frequency Division<br>
Duplex (FDD) mode and are generally based on a layer configuration of radio frames and timeslots. The form of radio frames and timeslots depends on the symbol rate of the physical channel.<br>
[42]	A radio frame is the minimum unit in the decoding process, consisting of 15 time<br>
slots. A time slot is the minimum unit in the Layer 1 bit sequence. Therefore, the number of bits that can be accommodated in one tune slot depends on the physical channel.<br>

[44]	The transport channel RACH is an uplink common channel used for transmitting<br>
control infomiation and user data. The transport channel RACH is utilized in random access and used for low-rate data transmissions from a higher layer. The RACH is mapped to an uplink physical channel, specifically the PRACH. The AICH is a downlink common channel, which exists as a pair with PRACH used for random access control.<br>
[45]	The transmission of PRACH is based on a slotted ALOHA approach with fast ac-<br>
quisition indication. The UE randomly selects an access resource and transmits a RACH preamble part of a random access procedure to the network.<br>
[46]	A preamble is a short signal that is sent before the transmission of the RACH<br>
connection request message. The UE 1 repeatedly transmits the preamble by increasing<br><br>
the transmission power each time the preamble is sent until it receives the Acquisition Indicator (AI) on AICH, which indicates the detection of the preamble by the UTRAN 2. The UE 1 stops the transmission of the preamble once it receives the AI and sends the message pait at the power level equal to the preamble transmission power at that point, adding an offset signaled by the UTRAN 2. FIG. 6 illustrates a power ramping procedure.<br>
[47]	This random access procedure avoids a power ramping procedure for the entire<br>
message. A power ramping procedure would create more interference due to unsuc¬cessfully sent messages and would be less efficient due to a larger delay since it would take much more time to decode the message before an acknowledgement could be transmitted to indicate successful receipt of the message.<br>
[48]	The main characteristics of the RACH is that it is a contention based channel subject<br>
to collisions due to simultaneous access of several users, which may preclude decoding of the initial access message by the network. The UE 1 can start the random access transmission of both preambles and message only at the beginning of an access slot. This access method is, therefore, a type of slotted ALOHA approach with fast ac¬quisition indication<br>
[49]	The time axis of both the RACH and the AICH is divided into time intervals or<br>
access slots. There are 15 access slots per two frames, with each frame having a length of 10 ms or 38400 chips, and the access slots ai-e spaced 1.33 ms or 5120 chips apait. FIG. 7 illustrates the number and spacing of access slots.<br>
[50]	The UTRAN 2 signals information regarding which access slots are available for<br>
random access transmission and the timing offsets to use between RACH and AICH, between two successive preambles and between the last preamble and the message. For example, if the AICH transmission timing is 0 and i, it is sent three and four access slots after the last preamble access slot transmitted, respectively. FIG. 8 illustrates the timing of the preamble, AI and message pai-t<br>
[51]	The timing at which the UE 1 can send the preamble is divided by random access sub<br>
channels. A random access sub channel is a subset including the combination of all uplink access slots. There are 12 random access sub channels. A random access sub channel consists of the access slots indicated in Table II.<br>

[53]	The preamble is a short signal that is sent before the transmission of the RACH<br>
message. A preamble consists of 4096 chips, which is a sequence of 256 repetitions of Hadamard codes of length 16 and scrambling codes assigned from the upper layer.<br>
[54]	The Hadamard codes are refened to as the signature of the preamble. There are 16<br>
different signatures and a signature is randomly selected from available signature sets on the basis of Access Service Classes (ASC) and repeated 256 times for each transmission of the preamble part. Table HI lists the preamble signatures.<br>
[55]	The message pait is spread by Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) codes<br>
that ai-e uniquely defined by the preamble signature and the spreading codes for use as the preamble signature. The 10 ms long message part radio frame is divided into 15 slots, each slot consisting of 2560 chips.<br>

[57]	Each slot includes a data part and a control part that i<br>
such as pilot bits and TFCI. The data part and the contr pai-allel. The 20 ms long message part consists of two consecutive message part radio frames. The data part consists of 10*2k bits, where k = 0,1, 2, 3, which con-esponds to a Spreading Factor (SF) of 256, 128, 64, 32. FIG. 9 illustrates the structure of the random access message part.<br>
[58]	The AICH consists of a repeated sequence of 15 consecutive access slots, each slot<br>
having a length of 40 bit intervals or 5120 chips. Each access slot includes two parts, an Acquisition Indicator (AI) part consisting of 32 real-valued signals, such as aO ... a31, and a part having a length of 1024 chips during which transmission is switched off.

signature in an RACH access slot, the UTRAN repeats this signature in the associated AICH access slot. Therefore, the Hadamard code used as the signature for the RACH preamble is modulated onto the AI part of the AICH.<br>
[60]	The acquisition indicator coiTesponding to a signature can have a value of + 1, -1 or 0<br>
depending on whether a positive acknowledgement (ACK), a negative acknow¬ledgement (NACK) or no acknowledgement is received in response to a specific signature. The positive polarity of the signature indicates that the preamble has been<br><br>
[61]<br>
[62]<br>
[63]<br><br>
acquired and the message can be sent.<br>
The negative polaiity indicates that the preamble has been acquired and the power ramping procedure shall be stopped, but the message shall not be sent. This negative acknowledgement is used when a received preamble cannot be processed at the present time due to congestion in the UTRAN 2 and the UE 1 must repeat the access attempt some time later.<br>
All UEs 1 are members of one of ten randomly allocated mobile populations, defined as Access Classes (AC) 0 to 9. The population number is stored in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) / Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM). UEs 1 may also be members of one or more out of 5 special categories of Access Classes 11 to 15, which ai^e allocated to specific high priority users and the information also stored in the SIM/USIM. Table IV lists the special AC and their allocation.<br>

The UTRAN 2 performs the random access procedure at protocol layer L2 by de¬termining whether to peimit the UE 1 to use a radio access resource based primarily upon the AC to which the UE belongs.<br>
It will be desirable to prevent UE 1 users from making access attempts, including emergency call attempts, or responding to pages in specified areas of a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) under certain circumstances. Such situations may arise during states of emergency or where 1 or more co-located PLMNs has failed. Broadcast messages should be available on a cell-by-cell basis to indicate the class(es) of subscribers barred from network access. The use of this facility allows the network operator to prevent overload of the access channel under critical conditions<br>
Access attempts are allowed if the UE 1 is a member of at least one AC that cor¬responds to the permitted classes as signaled over the air interface and the AC is ap¬plicable in the serving UTRAN 2. Access attempts ai-e otherwise not allowed. Any number of these AC may be ban'ed at any one time. Access Classes are applicable as<br><br>

An additional control bit for AC 10 is also signaled over the air interface to the UE 1. This control bit indicates whether access to the UTRAN 2 is allowed for Emergency Calls for UEs 1 with access classes 0 to 9 or without an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). Emergency calls are not allowed if both AC 10 and the relevant AC, 11 to 15 are baired for UEs 1 with access classes 11 to 15. Emergency calls are otherwise allowed.<br>
The AC ai-e mapped to ASC In the UMTS. There are eight different priority levels defined, specifically ASC 0 to ASC 7, with level 0 representing the highest priority.<br>
Access Classes shall only be applied at initial access, such as when sending an RRC Connection Request message. A mapping between AC and ASC shall be indicated by the information element "AC-to-ASC mapping" in System Information Block type 5. The correspondence between AC and ASC is indicated in Table VI.<br>
Table 6 [Table 6]<br><br><br><br>

In Table VI, "nth IE" designates an ASC number i in the range 0 - 7 to AC. The UE 1 behavior is unspecified if the ASC indicated by the "nth IE" is undefined.<br>
The parametei-s implied by the respective ASC are utilized for random access. A UE 1 that is a member of several ACs selects the ASC for the highest AC number. The AC is not applied in connected mode.<br>
An ASC consists of a subset of RACH preamble signatures and access slots that are allowed for the present access attempt and a persistence value corresponding to a probability, Pv 
 <br>
[75]	Existing specifications provide many RACH transmission control pai-ameters that are<br>
stored and updated by the UE 1 based on system information broadcast by the UTRAN 2. These parameters are received from RRC (SIO). The RACH transmission conti-ol parameters include PRACH, ASC, maximum number of preamble ramping cycles (M max), range of backoff intei-val for timer (TBOI) specified as a number of 10 ms transmission time intervals (NBoimax) and (NBoimw) and applicable when NACK is received on AICH.<br>
[76]	When it is determined that there is data to transmit (S20), the UE 1 maps the assigned<br>
AC to an ASC (S30). A count value M is then set to zero (S40).<br>
[77]	The count value M is then incremented by one (S50). The UE 1 determines if the<br>
count value M, which represents the maximum number of RACH transmission attempts, exceeds the maximum number of peitnitted RACH transmission attempts M<br>
n.«(S60).<br>
[78]	The UE 1 treats the transmission as unsuccessful if M exceeds Mnax. The UE 1 then<br>
indicates the unsuccessful transmission to a higher layer (S70)<br>
[79]	However, the UE 1 proceeds with the RACH access procedure if M is less than or<br>
equal to Mn^„. The UE 1 updates the RACH transmission control parameters (S80). A 10 ms timer T2 is set (S90) and the UE 1 determines whether to attempt transmission based on the persistence value Pi associated with the ASC selected by the UE.<br>
[80]	Specifically, a random number between 0 and 1, Rj, is generated (SlOO) and the<br>
random number is compared to the persistence value (SI 10). The UE 1 does not attempt transmission if Riis less than or equal to the persistence value Pj and waits until the 10 ms timer T2expires (SI20) before repeating the RACH access procedure by updating the RACH tiansmission control parameters (S80). However, the UE 1 attempts to transmit using assigned RACH resources (S130) if Ri is less than or equal to the persistence value Pj<br>
[81]	The UE 1 determines whether the response from the network is an Acknow-<br>
ledgement (ACK), a Non-Acknowledgment (NACK) or no response (S150) after the<br>
access attempt is transmitted. The UE 1 begins message transmission (SI 60) if an<br>
ACK is received, thereby indicating receipt of the UE transmission by the UTRAN 2.<br>
The UE 1 does not ti-ansmit the message and repeats the RACH access procedure by<br>
incrementing the count value M (S50) if no response is received or a NACK is<br>
received, thereby indicating a failed receipt of the transmission by the network, for<br>
example, due to a collision.<br>
[82]	The UE 1 only waits until the 10 ms timer T2 expires (S170) before repeating the<br>
RACH access procedure if no response was received. However, the UE 1 waits until the 10 ms timer T2expu-es (SI80) and also randomly generates a back off value NBOI associated with the PRACH assigned to the UE and between Nfioimax and NBoimin and<br><br>
waits an additional back off interval TBOI that is equal to 10 ms multiplied by the back<br>
off value NBOI (S190) before repeating the RACH access procedure if a NACK was<br>
received.<br>
[83]	The physical layer (LI) random access procedure is initiated upon request from the<br>
MAC sub layer (L2). The physical layer receives infoimation from a higher layer, spe¬<br>
cifically the RRC, before the physical random-access procedure is initiated and<br>
receives infoitnation from a higher layer, specifically the MAC, at each initiation of<br>
the physical random access procedure. The information is indicated in Table VII. The<br>
physical layer random-access procedure is illustrated in FIG. 12.<br>
[84]	As illustrated in FIG. 12, one access slot in the random access subchannel that can be<br>
used for the given ASC is randomly selected from access slots that can be used in the<br>
next full access slot sets (S200). One access slot is randomly chosen from access slots<br>
that can be used in the next full access slot sets if there are no access slots available.<br>
One signature is then randomly selected from the set of available signatures within the<br>
given ASC (S210).<br>
[85]	The preamble retransmission counter is set at Preamble Reti'ans Max (S220), which<br>
is the maximum number of preamble retransmission attempts. The preamble<br>
transmission power is set at Preamble Initial Power (S230), which is the initial<br>
transmission power of the preamble. The preamble is then transmitted according to the<br>
chosen uphnk access slot, signature and set transmission power (S240).<br>
[86]	The UE 1 then determines whether the UTRAN 2 detected the preamble (S250). No<br>
random access message is transmitted if a NACK is detected in the downlink access<br>
slot corresponding to the selected uplink access slot. A random access message is<br>
transmitted if an ACK is detected in the downlink access slot corresponding to the<br>
selected uplink access slot. The preamble is retransmitted if no response, specifically<br>
neither an ACK nor a NACK for the selected signature, is detected in the downlink<br>
access slot corresponding to the selected uplink access slot.<br>

[88]	When no response is received, the next available access slot is selected from the<br>
random access subchannel within the given ASC (S260), a new signature is randomly selected from the available signatures within the given ASC (S270), the preamble transmission power is increased by the step width of the power ramping (Power Ramp Step) (S280) and the preamble retransmission counter is reduced by 1 (S290). The UE 1 then detemiines if the maximum number of retransmissions have been attempted (S300). This preamble re-transmission procedure is repeated for as long as the preamble retransmission counter exceeds 0 and no response is received. The MAC is infoiTTied that no ACK was received on AICH (S310) and the physical layer random access procedure is terminated once the retransmission counter reaches 0.<br>
[89]	If an ACK is received, the transmission power of the control channel of the random<br>
access message is set at a level higher than the transmission power of the last preamble ti-ansmitted according to a power offset (S320) and the random access message is<br><br>
transmitted 3 or 4 uplink access slots after the uplink access slot of the last transmitted<br>
preamble depending on the AICH transmission timing pai'ameter (S330). The higher<br>
layer is then informed of the receipt of the ACK and transmission of the random access<br>
message (S340) and the physical layer random access procedure is tenninated.<br>
[90]	If a NACK is received, no random access message is transmitted and no re-<br>
transmission of the preamble is performed. The MAC is informed that a NACK was<br>
received (S350) and the physical layer random access procedure is terminated.<br>
[91]	FIG. 13 illustrates a signaling establishment procedure between a UE 1 and UTRAN<br>
2. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the RRC Connection Request message is transmitted once<br>
the PRACH power control preambles have been acknowledged (S400). The RRC<br>
Connection Request message includes a reason for requesting the connection.<br>
[92]	The UTRAN 2 determines which resources to reseiTe and perfoiTns synchronization<br>
and signaling establishment among radio network nodes, such as a NodeB 5 and<br>
serving RNC 4, depending on the request reason (S410). The UTRAN 2 then transmits<br>
the Connection Setup message to the UE 1, thereby conveying information about radio<br>
resource to use (S420).<br>
[93]	The UE 1 confirms connection establishment by sending the Connection Setup<br>
Complete message to the UTRAN 2 (S430). The UE 1 transmits the Initial Direct<br>
Transfer message to the UTRAN 2 once the connection has been established (S440).<br>
The Initial Direct Transfer message includes infomiation such as the UE identity, UE<br>
current location and the kind of transaction requested.<br>
[94]	Authentication is then performed between the UE 1 and UTRAN 2 and security<br>
mode communication is established (S450). The actual set up infomiation is delivered<br>
to the UTRAN 2 from the UE 1 via the Call Control Setup message (S460). The Call<br>
Control Setup message identifies the transaction and indicates the QoS requii'ements.<br>
[95]	The UTRAN 2 initiates activities for radio beai'er allocation by determining if there<br>
are sufficient resources available to satisfy the requested QoS and transmits the Call<br>
Control Complete message to the UE 1 (S470). The radio bearer is allocated according<br>
to the request if there are sufficient resources available. The UTRAN 2 may select<br>
either to continue allocation with a lowered QoS value, queue the request until<br>
sufficient radio resources become available or reject the call request if sufficient<br>
resources are not presently available.<br>
[96]	The long-term evolution (LTE) of UMTS is under discussion by the 3rd generation<br>
partnership project (3GPP) that standai-dized UMTS. The 3GPP LTE is a technology<br>
for enabling high-speed packet communications. Many schemes have been proposed<br>
for the LTE objective including those that aim to reduce user and provider costs,<br>
improve service quality, and expand and improve coverage and system capacity.<br>
[97]	The 3G LTE requires reduced cost per bit, increased sewice availability, flexible use<br><br>
of a frequency band, a simple stmcture, an open interface, and adequate power con¬sumption of a tenninal as an upper-level requirement. Generally, The UTRAN 2 cor¬responds to E-UTRAN (Evolved-UTRAN). The NodeB 5 and / or RNC 4 correspond to e-NodeB in the LTE system. The following is the overview of the current LTE study assumption for RACH.<br>
[98]	The random access procedure is classified into two categories; non-synchi^onized<br>
random access and synchronized random access. Only the non-synchronized random access procedure is considered herein.<br>
[99]	Non-synchronized access is used when the uplink from a UE 1 has not been time<br>
synchronized or when the UE uplink loses synchronization. Non-synchronized access allows the UTRAN 2 to estimate and adjust the UE 1 transmission timing if necessai^y. Therefore the non-synchronized random access preamble is used for at least time alignment and signature detection.<br>
[100]        FIG. 14 illustrates a random access burst. The message pay load may include any ad¬ditional associated signaling information, such as a random ID, Pathloss/Channel Quality indicator (CQI), or access purpose. A message payload up to 6 bits is transmitted in the random access burst along with the preamble as illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
[101]        A UE 1 randomly selects a signature from a group of signatures to distinguish<br>
between different UEs that attempt an access simultaneously. The preamble must have good auto-con-elation properties in order for the UTRAN 2 to obtain an accurate timing estimate.<br>
[102]        Additionally, different preambles should have good cross-coirelation properties in order for the UTRAN 2 to distinguish between simultaneous access attempts for different UEs 1 using different signatures. A constant amplitude zero auto-coirelation (CAZAC) sequence is used as a preamble signamre sequence to achieve good detection probability.<br>
[103]        Layer 1 shall receive the information listed in Table VIII from the higher layers prior to initiation of the non-synchionized physical random access procedure. The in¬formation is ti-ansmitted as part of the System Infonnation from higher layei-s. [104]        Table 8<br><br>

[105]        FIG. 15 illustrates a call flow diagram for a non-synchronized physical random access procedure. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the physical layer (LI) random access procedure encompasses successful transmission of the random access preamble (message 1) and the random access response (message 2). The remaining messages are scheduled for transmission by the higher layer on the shared data channel and thus ai-e not considered part of the LI random access procedure. A random access channel is a 1.08 MHz portion of a subframe or set of consecutive subframes reserved for random access preamble ti-ansiTiissions.<br>
[106]        A random access channel is randomly selected from the available non-synchronized random access channels and a preamble sequence is then randomly selected from the available preamble set based on the message to be transmitted. The random access procedure ensures that each of the allowed selections is chosen with equal probability.<br>
[107]        The initial preamble transmission power level, which is set by the MAC, is de¬termined using an open loop power control procedure. The transmission counter is set to the maximum number of preamble retransmissions.<br>
[108]        A Random Access Preamble (message 1) is then ti-ansmitted using the selected<br>
random access channel, preamble sequence, and preamble transmission power. The LI status "ACK on non-synchronized random access received" is reported to the higher layers, such as the MAC, and the physical random access procedure is tenninated if a Random Access Response (message 2) coiresponding to the transmitted preamble sequence (message 1) is detected. Another random access channel and preamble are randomly selected if no Random Access Response (message 2) corresponding to the transmitted preamble sequence (message 1) is detected.<br>
[109]        Preamble reti-ansmission occurs as long as the maximum transmission power and the maximum number of retransmissions have not been reached. The LI status "no ac-<br><br>
knowledgment on non-synchronized random access" is reported to the higher layei-s, such as the MAC, and the physical random access procedure is tenninated if the maximum transmission power or the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached. [110]        The main purpose of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) random access procedure is to obtain uplink time synchronization and to obtain access to the network, A random access mechanism can be described where a preamble is sent from a UEl to a NodeB 5 in order to determine the timing misalignment. The preamble stmcture is based on Zadoff-Chu sequences with Zero Coirelation Zone (ZC-ZCZ) and different root sequence indices when the required number of zones cannot be generated.<br>
[Ill]        The zero-coiTelation zone for the ZC-ZCZ sequence is generated using a cyclic shift version of the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) caixier sequence. Cyclic shifts within the same root sequence then form an ideal set of signatures for LTE RACH preambles since their cross-conelation is zero.<br>
[112]        However, this is true only if the frequency error is small and for UEs 1 with low mobility. The excellent properties of ZC-ZCZ sequences disappear as the frequency error increase for high-speed mobility UEs 1, thereby inducing overlapping between shifted sequences and making the sequence detection poor and impossible in some cases. Therefore, the cyclic shift is designed to avoid overlapping with the next shifted position when high-speed mobility UEs 1 are supported within the cell, which results in the use of a restricted set of cyclic shifts.<br>
[113]        In other words the preamble cyclic shift length design differs for cells supporting<br>
high-speed mobility UEs 1. In fact, the cyclic shift depends not only on cell size but is also proportional to sequence index when there is high Doppler.<br>
[114]        Therefore, the LTE RACH preamble sequence design is different for low and high mobility UEs 1. Furthermore, the conventional procedure does not use Zadoff-Chu sequences with Zero Correlation Zone (ZC-ZCZ) sequences for the RACH preamble.<br>
[115]        For example, the WCDMA RACH preamble consists of 4096 chips, which is a sequence of 256 repetitions of Hadamai-d codes of length 16 and scrambling codes. This facilitates simple and accurate frequency error estimation then the same sequence design is used for both low and high speed UEs 1.<br>

IVIode for the Invention<br>
[154]        The present invention allows a UE 1 to correctly map the signature indexes onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences when the deployed cells support a high-speed mobility UE 1. The present invention proposes to inform a UE 1 whether a cell supports high-speed mobility such that RACH signatures may be correctly mapped onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences. This infonnation may either be broadcast on the system information in a cell or fixed in the standai-d. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the ac¬companying drawings.<br>
[155]        The ZC sequences of odd length N ai-e defined by the following equation:<br><br>
f ^^^J     au(k) = exp [-J2TT M (k(k+1)/2N}], where: N is a sequence length,<br>
M = 1... N-1 is a root index of different sequences, and k= 0 ...N-1 are indexes of the samples of a sequence,<br>
[157]        ZC sequences have ideal correlation properties in the absence of frequency eiTor, such that the periodic autocorrelation shows no side-peaks and the cross-coiielation between two sequences with different a root index M has a constant value when the index of the samples of a sequence N is a prime number. Therefore, cyclic shifts of a sequence form an ideal set of signatures for RACH preambles because theii- cross-correlation is zero and they can all be detected simultaneously using frequency domain processing.<br>
[158]        The number of cyclic shifts available for a single root index M depends on the length of the sequence and the propagation delay uncertainty: The shift must be larger than the maximum propagation delay for given cell sizes.<br>
[159]        However, this is true only if the frequency error is small, such as for low-speed mobility UEs 1. The ZC sequences are quite sensitive to the frequency error. The frequency en-or does not severely affect the cross-correlation between two ZC sequences but affects the detection of contiguous sequences due to overlapped channel response that cannot be discriminated from each other, an example of which is il¬lustrated in FIG. 16. The duration between the correct timing of the delay profile in FIG. 16, such as t for M and 2t for M+1, and the alias of the delay profile, such as t-M and t+M, caused by large frequency offset in a high-speed mobility UE 1 is pro¬portional to sequence index M.<br>
[160]        Peiformance is improved if cyclic shifts in high Doppler environments are limited so that the cyclic shift pairs of each sequence period uncertainty are not in the sequence period uncertainty of any RACH preamble and the cyclic shift of t-1 of each sequence period uncertainty is different from the cyclic shifts of t -i-l of all sequences period un¬certainty. This results in using a restricted set of cyclic shifts for cells supporting high¬speed mobility UEs 1.<br>
[161]        The cyclic shift design may be done such that the alias channel response is not<br>
overlapped with the other circular shift positions since the frequency offset in a high¬speed mobility UE 1 is proportional to sequence index M. Rules and methods of such design are known in the ai-t.<br>
[162]        The cyclic shift design is different depending upon whether a cell supports high¬speed mobility UEs 1. The basic random access procedure is for a UE 1 to send a random access preamble (message 1), which cai'ries the signature access to Node B 5.<br><br>
However, the access signature is only sent to meet coverage requii-ement for non-synchronized random access within the LTE framework.<br>
[163]        The waveform of the LTE signamre is based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) with zero-correlation zones (ZCZ) and different mother sequence indexes when the required number of zones cannot be generated. This is because the number of ZCZ sequences is reduced inversely proportionally to cell radius. Therefore, additional ZCZ sequences from another index are added when the number of ZCZ sequences insufficient.<br>
[ 164]        The zero-con-elation zones allow for ideal detection in the presence of interfering<br>
preambles. The optimal auto-conelation property of the CAZAC sequence is destroyed when the Doppler spread of a high-speed mobility UE 1 induces the frequency offset, thereby resulting in degraded detection peifonnance. Doppler shift and frequency en-or on the uplink have properties depending on the channel condition, for example, line-of-site (LOS) condition or Non-line-of-site (NLOS) condition.<br>
[ 165]        Frequency offset due to UE 1 mobility is spread over a range from the carrier frequency In NLOS. Therefore, a UE 1 tracks around the<br>
Afes+AfuE<br>
frequency offset. The frequency offset of the received uplink signal is nearly zero and one way Doppler spread can be considered. [166]        The maximum frequency offset of the receiver signal In LOS, such as when a high¬speed mobility vehicle moves towards or away from the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) 2, is described as:<br>
t^^^J       follset,UL = AfuE + 2fDoppter_max, Where<br>
fes denotes the base station frequency drift, AfuE denotes UE 1 frequency error and fDoppier.max denotes the maximum Doppler frequency.<br>
[168]       The worst-case frequency offset is around 1400Hz with mobility of 350 km/h at a 2 GHz carrier frequency. A UE 1 tiacks around 650Hz Doppler shift on the downlink in the LOS environment and then transmits uplink data compensated frequency offset in advance based on the estimated frequency offset on the downlink. Therefore, the frequency offset due to UE 1 mobility becomes twice of the Doppler shift of the channel at the NodeB 2, for example, 1300Hz.<br>
[169]       There may be two or three dominant components at the detection stage if there is<br>
frequency offset at the receiver due to Doppler spread or residual frequency offset, as illustrated in FIG. 17. Therefore, the frequency offset spreads the channel response over a wide range depending on the sequence index M that is used.<br><br>
[170]        It is possible to predict where the channel response will occur if frequency offset exists when the ZC sequence index is known. The circulai- shift should be designed such that the alias channel response is not overlapped with the other circular shift positions. Therefore, the cyclic shift is depends not only on the cell size but also is pro¬portional to the sequence index M, which results in the restricted set of cyclic shifts as compared to the low Doppler case and also in different RACH signature mapping.<br>
[171]        The methods and approaches regarding how to design the cyclic shifts when a cell supports high-speed mobility are known in the ait. For example, nales for three different approaches ai"e proposed.<br>
[172]        The fii-st approach is an "additional margin method" where:<br>
[173]      1 
[174]       [00171] The second approach is a "multiple circular shifts as one opportunity<br>
method" where: [175]      2To 
^''^      LN/3j<m></m>
[178]        In all three approaches, N is a sequence length or ZC sequence length, M is one<br>
sequence index or a ZC root index, and To is the minimum cyclic shift for a given cell based on cell size. The necessary information, such as N, can be fixed in a standard while other information, such as To and M, should be broadcast on the system in-fonnation.<br>
[179]       The present invention proposes that the network broadcast one information bit to infonn a UE I if high-speed mobility UEs is supported. This information bit would enable con-ect mapping of RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences. A UE 1 reads the information bit indicating support of high-speed mobility in a cell or in¬dicating the use of a restricted set of cyclic shifts upon receiving a broadcast message relative to RACH information.<br>
[180]        Information related to TO and M shall have already obtained by a UE 1 from in¬formation broadcast by the E-UTRAN 2 before processing the infoimation bit. The UE 1 shall have also aheady obtained inforaiation related to N and the maximum number of RACH signatures from the broadcast infonnation if those values are not fixed by a standard. The UE 1 then determines whether the information bit indicates that high¬speed mobility is supported.<br>
[181]        Mapping of RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences can be easily<br>
perfonned for each cell when high-speed mobility is not supported, as indicated by the infoi-mation bit having a value of "FALSE" or "0." A UE 1 and E-UTRAN 2 can map<br><br>
RACH signatures onto the ZC sequences of index M, with RACH signatures incre¬mentally mapped onto subsequent cyclic-shifted versions by To of the same ZC sequence until all possible cyclic shifts have been mapped for a given index M. New consecutive indexes M ai'e added until the total number of signatures equals a value specified in the standai'd or system information.<br>
[182]        The E-UTRAN 2 may broadcast only one index M, with the UE 1 using consecutive indexes to generate the number of requii-ed preambles. An alternative is for the E-UTRAN 2 to broadcast a set of several indexes M not necessarily consecutive to each other, with the UE 1 using the first index within the set and then using consecutive indexes within the set and mapping signatures in the same manner by stalling from a higher or lower sequence index.<br>
[183]        Specifically, the UE 1 starts mapping RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences by mapping onto the fii-st ZC sequence of the received index M or on the first index M in a received list. The UE 1 then incrementally maps the next subsequent signatures onto subsequent right-cyclic-shifted versions by the minimum cyclic shift length To of the same ZC sequence index M until the maximum number of RACH signatures is reached or all possible cyclic shifts of index M have been obtained.<br>
[184]        The UE 1 maps the next signature onto the next ZC sequence index M-t-l or the next index in the list if the maximum number of RACH signatures is not reached before all possible cyclic shifts of index M ai'e used. The UE 1 then maps the next subsequent signatures onto its subsequent right-cyclic-shifted versions by the minimum cyclic shift length To- This signature mapping is repeated over all ZC sequence indexes and stops when the maximum number of RACH signatures is reached.<br>
[ 185]        The niles for using a restricted set of cyclic shifts for cells supporting high-speed mobility UEs 1 are applied when the information bit has a value of "TRUE" or "1." These rules can be either fixed in a standard or broadcast by the E-UTRAN 2.<br>
[186]        A UE 1 and the E-UTRAN 2 calculate the available cyclic shifts proportional to the index M and add new consecutive indexes M+1 by adjusting the cyclic shifts propor¬tionally until the total number of signatures equals a value specified in the standard or system information. The relationship between the three cyclic shift approaches and the sequence index M is applied as illustrated In FIG. 18.<br>
[187]        The E-UTRAN 2 may broadcast only one index M, with the UE 1 using consecutive indexes to generate the number of required preambles. An alternative is for the E-UTRAN 2 to broadcast a set of several indexes M not necessarily consecutive to each other, with the UE 1 using the first index within the set and then using consecutive indexes within the set and mapping signatures in the same manner by starting from a higher or lower sequence index and mapping signatures in the same manner by applying the relationships illustrated in FIG. 18, starting from a higher or lower<br><br>
sequence index.<br>
[188]        Specifically, the UEl starts mapping RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences by determining, for received index M or for the first index M in a received list, the cyclic shift that can be applied according to the restricted set of cyclic shifts that can be used. The previously described rules are used as an example, but it should be noted that other possible nales for detennining the restricted set of cyclic shifts could be applied.<br>

This signature mapping is repeated over all ZC sequence indexes and stops when the maximum number of RACH signatures is reached. [193]       FIG. 19 illustiates a block diagram of a mobile station (MS) or UE 1. The AT 2 includes a processor (or digital signal processor) 510, RF module 535, power management module 505, antenna 540, battery 555, display 515, keypad 520, memory 530, SIM card 525 (which may be optional), speaker 545 and microphone 550. [194]        A user enters instructional information, such as a telephone number, for example, by pushing the buttons of a keypad 520 or by voice activation using the microphone 550. The microprocessor 510 receives and processes the instnactional information to perfoiTn the appropriate function, such as to dial the telephone number. Operational data may be retiieved from the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 525 or the memory module 530 to perform the function. Furthermore, the processor 510 may display the instmctional and operational infonnation on the display 515 for the user's reference and convenience.<br>
[195]        The processor 510 issues instinctional information to the RF module 535, to initiate communication, for example, transmits radio signals comprising voice communication data. The RF module 535 comprises a receiver and a transmitter to receive and transmit radio signals. An antenna 540 facilitates the transmission and reception of radio signals. Upon receiving radio signals, the RF module 535 may foiAvard and convert the signals to baseband frequency for processing by tlie processor 510. The processed signals would be transfonned into audible or readable information outputted via the speaker 545, for example. The processor 510 also includes the protocols and functions necessary to perform the various processes described herein.<br>
