PLASMA SYSTEM<br>
	[0001] The present invention relates to a plasma system or assembly and a method of<br>
	treating a substrate using said assembly.<br>
5<br>
	[0002] When matter is continually supplied with energy, its temperature increases and it<br>
	typically transforms from a solid to a liquid and, then, to a gaseous state. Continuing to supply<br>
	energy causes the system to undergo yet a further change of state in which neutral atoms or<br>
	molecules of the gas are broken up by energetic collisions to produce negatively charged<br>
10	electrons, positive or negatively charged ions and other excited species. This mix of charged<br>
	and other excited particles exhibiting collective behaviour is called "plasma", the fourth state of<br>
	matter. Due to their electrical charge, plasmas are highly influenced by external<br>
	electromagnetic fields, which makes them readily controllable. Furthermore, their high energy<br>
	content allows them to achieve processes which are impossible or difficult through the other<br>
15	 states of matter, such as by liquid or gas processing.<br>
	[0003] The term "plasma" covers a wide range of systems whose density and temperature<br>
	vary by many orders of magnitude. Some plasmas are very hot and all their microscopic<br>
	species (ions, electrons, etc.) are in approximate thermal equilibrium, the energy input into the<br>
20	 system being widely distributed through atomic/molecular level collisions. Other plasmas,<br>
	however, particular those at low pressure (e.g.100 Pa) where collisions are relatively infrequent,<br>
	have their constituent species at widely different temperatures and are called "non-thermal<br>
	equilibrium" plasmas. In these non-thermal plasmas the free electrons are very hot with<br>
	temperatures of many thousands of Kelvin (K) whilst the neutral and ionic species remain cool.<br>
25	 Because the free electrons have almost negligible mass, the total system heat content is low<br>
	and the plasma operates close to room temperature thus allowing the processing of<br>
	temperature sensitive materials, such as plastics or polymers, without imposing a damaging<br>
	thermal burden onto the sample. However, the hot electrons create, through high energy<br>
	collisions, a rich source of radicals and excited species with a high chemical potential energy<br>
30	 capable of profound chemical and physical reactivity. It is this combination of low temperature<br>
	operation plus high reactivity which makes non-thermal plasma technologically important and a<br>
	very powerful tool for manufacturing and material processing, capable of achieving processes<br>
	which, if achievable at all without plasma, would require very high temperatures or noxious and<br>
	aggressive chemicals.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/048650		PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
2<br>
	[0004] For industrial applications of plasma technology, a convenient method is to couple<br>
	electromagnetic power into a volume of process gas. A process gas may be a single gas or a<br>
	mixture of gases and vapours which is excitable to a plasma state by the application of the<br>
	electromagnetic power. Workpieces/samples are treated by the plasma generated by being<br>
5	 immersed or passed through the plasma itself or charged and/or excited species derived<br>
	therefrom because the process gas becomes ionised and excited, generating species including<br>
	chemical radicals, and ions as well as UV-radiation, which can react or interact with the surface<br>
	of the workpieces/samples. By correct selection of process gas composition, driving power<br>
	frequency, power coupling mode, pressure and other control parameters, the plasma process<br>
10	 can be tailored to the specific application required by a manufacturer.<br>
	[0005] Because of the huge chemical and thermal range of plasmas, they are suitable for<br>
	many technological applications. Non-thermal equilibrium plasmas are particularly effective for<br>
	surface activation, surface cleaning, material etching and coating of surfaces.<br>
15<br>
	[0006] Since the 1960s the microelectronics industry has developed the low pressure Glow<br>
	Discharge plasma into an ultra-high technology and high capital cost engineering tool for<br>
	semiconductor, metal and dielectric processing. The same low pressure Glow Discharge type<br>
	plasma has increasingly penetrated other industrial sectors since the 1980s offering polymer<br>
20	 surface activation for increased adhesion/bond strength, high quality degreasing/cleaning and<br>
	the deposition of high performance coatings. Glow discharges can be achieved at both<br>
	vacuum and atmospheric pressures. In the case of atmospheric pressure glow discharge,<br>
	gases such as helium or argon are utilised as diluents and a high frequency (e.g.&gt; 1kHz)<br>
	power supply is used to generate a homogeneous glow discharge at atmospheric pressure<br>
25	 via a Penning ionisation mechanism, (see for example, Kanazawa et al, J.Phys. D: Appl.<br>
	Phys. 1988, 21, 838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn. Symp. Plasma Chem. 1989, 2, 95, Kanazawa<br>
	et al, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physical Research 1989, B37/38, 842, and<br>
	Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990, 23, 374).<br>
30 	[0007] Corona and flame (also a plasma) treatment systems have provided industry with<br>
	atmospheric pressure plasma processing capability for about 30 years. However, despite their<br>
	high manufacturability, these systems have failed to penetrate the market or be taken up by<br>
	industry to anything like the same extent as the lower pressure, bath-processing-only plasma<br>
	type. The reason is that corona/flame systems have significant limitations. Flame systems can<br>
35	 be extremely effective at depositing coatings, but operate at high temperatures (&gt;10,000K).<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
3<br>
	They are therefore only suitable for certain high temperature substrates such as metals and<br>
	ceramics. Corona systems operate in ambient air, typically offering a single surface activation<br>
	process (i.e. oxidation) and have a negligible effect on many materials and a weak effect on<br>
	most. The treatment is often non-uniform as the corona discharge is a non-homogeneous<br>
5	 discharge being generated between a point and plane electrode. The corona process is<br>
	incompatible with thick webs or 3D workpieces.<br>
	[0008] A variety of "plasma jet" systems have been developed, as means of atmospheric<br>
	pressure plasma treatment. Plasma jet systems generally consist of a gas stream which is<br>
10	 directed between two electrodes. As power is applied between the electrodes, a plasma is<br>
	formed and this produces a mixture of ions, radicals and active species which can be used<br>
	to treat various substrates. The plasma produced by a plasma jet system is directed from<br>
	the space between the electrodes (the plasma zone) as a flame-like phenomenon and can<br>
	be used to treat remote objects.<br>
15<br>
	[0009] US Patents 5,198,724 and 5,369,336 describe the first "cold" or non-thermal<br>
	equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma jet (hereafter referred to as APPJ), which<br>
	consisted of an RF powered metal needle acting as a cathode, surrounded by an outer<br>
	cylindrical anode. US Patent 6,429, 400 describes a system for generating a blown<br>
20	 atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD). This comprises a central electrode<br>
	separated from an outer electrode by an electrical insulator tube. The inventor claims that<br>
	the design does not generate the high temperatures associated with the prior art. Kang et al<br>
	(Surf Coat. Techno!., 2002, 171, 141-148) have also described a 13.56 MHz RF plasma<br>
	source that operates by feeding helium or argon gas through two coaxial electrodes. In<br>
25	 order to prevent an arc discharge, a dielectric material is loaded outside the central<br>
	electrode. WO94/14303 describes a device in which an electrode cylinder has a pointed<br>
	portion at the exit to enhance plasma jet formation.<br>
	[0010] US Patent No. 5,837,958 describes an APPJ based on coaxial metal electrodes<br>
30	 where a powered central electrode and a dielectric coated ground electrode are utilised. A<br>
	portion of the ground electrode is left exposed to form a bare ring electrode near the gas<br>
	exit. The gas flow (air or argon) enters through the top and is directed to form a vortex,<br>
	which keeps the arc confined and focused to form a plasma jet. To cover a wide area, a<br>
	number of jets can be combined to increase the coverage.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
4<br>
	[0011] Schutze et aL (IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 1998, 26 (6), 1685) describe a device using<br>
	concentric electrodes, though no dielectric was present between the electrodes. By using a<br>
	high flow of helium (He) (typically 92 standard litres per minute (slm) as the process gas, it<br>
	was possible to avoid arcing and generate a stable plasma flame.<br>
5	<br>
	[0012] US Patent 6,465,964 describes an alternative system for generating an APP J, in<br>
	which a pair of electrodes are placed around a cylindrical tube. Process gas enters through<br>
	the top of the tube and exits through the bottom. When an AC electric field is supplied<br>
	between the two electrodes, a plasma is generated by passing a process gas therebetween<br>
10	 within the tube and this gives rise to an APPJ at the exit. The position of the electrodes<br>
	ensures that the electric field forms in the axiai direction. In order to extend this technology<br>
	to the coverage of wide area substrates, the design can be modified, such that the central<br>
	tube and electrodes are redesigned to have a rectangular tubular shape. This gives rise to a<br>
	wide area plasma, which can be used to treat large substrates such as reel-to-reel plastic<br>
15	 film.<br>
	[0013] Other authors have reported the formation of wide area plasma jets based on<br>
	parallel plate technology. Gherardi, N. et al., J. Phys D: Appl. Phys, 2000, 33, L104-L108<br>
	describe the production of a silica coating by passing a mixture of N2, SiH4 and N2 through a<br>
20	 dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma formed between two parallel electrodes. The<br>
	species exiting the reactor were allowed to deposit on a downstream substrate. EP11 71900<br>
	describes a parallel plate reactor, which uses (RF) power to create a helium APGD. This is<br>
	seen as an easily scaled up alternative to the concentric electrodes of the jet system.<br>
	Another device consists of two perforated circular plates separated by a gap. The upper<br>
25	 plate is connected to a 13.56 MHz RF power supply and the lower plate is grounded. A<br>
	laminar flow of process gas is passed through the perforations in the top plate and enters the<br>
	inter-electrode gap. Here the gas is ionised and a plasma forms. Arcing is prevented in the<br>
	apparatus by using gas mixtures containing He (which limits ionisation), by using high flow<br>
	velocities, and by properly spacing the RF-powered electrode. The process gas then exits<br>
30	 the device through the perforations in the second electrode.<br>
	[0014] EP 0 431 951 describes a system for treating a substrate with the gases exiting a<br>
	parallel plate reactor. This comprises flowing a gas through one or more parallel plate<br>
	reactors and allowing the excited species to interact with a substrate placed adjacent to the<br>
35	 gas exit.<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
5<br>
	[0015] Toshifuji et al (Surf. Coat. Technol., 2003, 171, 302-306) reported the formation of a<br>
	cold arc plasma formed using a needle electrode placed inside a glass tube. A similar<br>
	system has been reported by Dinescu et al. (Proceedings of ISPC 16, Taormina, Italy, June<br>
5	 2003). Janca et al. (Surf. Coat. Technol. 116-119 (1999), 547-551) describe a high<br>
	frequency plasma 'pencil' in which a pencil-shaped dielectric with a built-in hollow electrode<br>
	is used to generate a plasma at atmospheric, reduced or increased pressure. As an active<br>
	material flowing through the plasma jet a gas, a liquid or a mixture of dispersed particles<br>
	(powders) can be used.<br>
10<br>
	[0016] US 5,798,146 describes a single needle design that does not require the use of a<br>
	counter electrode. Instead, a single sharp electrode is placed inside a tube and applying a<br>
	high voltage to the electrode produces a leakage of electrons, which further react with the<br>
	gas surrounding the electrode, to produce a flow or ions and radicals. As there is no second<br>
15	 electrode, this does not result in the formation of an arc. Instead, a low temperature plasma<br>
	is formed which is carried out of the discharge space by a flow of gas. Various nozzle heads<br>
	have been developed to focus or spread the plasma. The system may be used to activate,<br>
	clean or etch various substrates. Stoffels et al (Plasma Sources Sci. Technol., 2002, 11,<br>
	383-388) have developed a similar system for biomedical uses.<br>
20<br>
	[0017] WO 02/028548 describes a method for forming a coating on a substrate by<br>
	introducing an atomized liquid and/or solid coating material into an atmospheric pressure<br>
	plasma discharge or an ionized gas stream resulting therefrom. WO 02/098962 describes<br>
	coating a low surface energy substrate by exposing the substrate to a silicon compound in<br>
25	 liquid or gaseous form and subsequently post-treating by oxidation or reduction using a<br>
	plasma or corona treatment, in particular a pulsed atmospheric pressure glow discharge or<br>
	dielectric barrier discharge. WO 03/085693 describes an atmospheric plasma generation<br>
	assembly having one or more parallel electrode arrangements adapted for generating a<br>
	plasma, means for introducing a process gas and an atomizer for atomizing and introducing<br>
30	 a reactive agent. The assembly is such that the only exit for the process gas and the<br>
	reactive agent is through the plasma region between the electrodes.<br>
	[0018] WO 03/097245 and WO 03/101621 describe applying an atomised coating material<br>
	onto a substrate to form a coating. The atomised coating material, upon leaving an atomizer<br>
35	 such as an ultrasonic nozzle or a nebuliser, passes through an excited medium (plasma) to<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
6<br>
	the substrate. The substrate is positioned remotely from the excited medium. The plasma is<br>
	generated in a pulsed manner.<br>
	[0019] Many plasma jet type designs cannot be used to treat conductive substrates,<br>
5	 especially grounded metal substrates, if the distance between the electrode and the<br>
	substrate is too small. There is a tendency for the plasma to break down and form a high<br>
	temperature arc between the powered eiectrode(s) and the substrate. In effect, the<br>
	substrate acts as a counter electrode. However, if the distance between the electrode and<br>
	the substrate is sufficient (~ 150mm or more), then a stable plasma jet can be formed. But<br>
10	 in order to treat a substrate placed at such a distance, the jet has to be stable over quite a<br>
	long distance. It has been found that irrespective of the process gas used, the plasma jet is<br>
	quenched upon exposure to air and this limits the length of most jets. One method to extend<br>
	the length of the flame is to minimise the air entrainment. This can be achieved by<br>
	maintaining a laminar gas flow. Turbulent gas flow maximises mixing with air and rapidly<br>
15	 quenches the plasma. However, even with a laminar flow, the plasma jet is usually less than<br>
	75 mm.<br>
	[0020] In a first embodiment of the invention the inventors have shown that the non-<br>
	equilibrium discharge from the plasma which may be referred to as flame-like could be<br>
20	 stabilized over considerable distances by confining it to a long length of tubing. This<br>
	prevents air mixing and minimises quenching of the flame-like non-equilibrium plasma<br>
	discharge. The flame-like non-equilibrium plasma discharge extends at least to the outlet,<br>
	and usually beyond the outlet, of the tubing.<br>
25 	[0021] Thus in a process according to the invention for plasma treating a surface, a non-<br>
	equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma is generated within a dielectric housing having an<br>
	inlet and an outlet through which a process gas flows from the inlet to the outlet, a tube<br>
	formed at least partly of dielectric material extends outwardly from the outlet of the housing,<br>
	whereby the end of the tube forms the plasma outlet, and the surface to be treated is<br>
30	 positioned adjacent to the plasma outlet so that the surface is in contact with the plasma and<br>
	is moved relative to the plasma outlet.<br>
	[0022] An apparatus for plasma treating a surface comprises<br>
	a dielectric housing having an inlet and an outlet,<br>
35	 means for causing a process gas to flow from the inlet to the outlet,<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
7<br>
	means for generating a non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma in the process gas,<br>
	a tube formed at least partly of dielectric material extending outwardly from the outlet of the<br>
	housing, whereby the end of the tube forms the plasma outlet, and<br>
	means for moving the surface to be treated relative to the plasma outlet while maintaining<br>
5	 the surface adjacent to the plasma outlet.<br>
	[0023] The use of an outwardly extending tube according to the invention extends the<br>
	length of the flame-like non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma discharge beyond that<br>
	which can otherwise be achieved with the particular process gas used. Using helium or<br>
10	 argon as process gas, it is possible to create a flame-like discharge that extends for at least<br>
15	0mm. and often more than 300 mm. and can be used to treat conductive substrates, even<br>
	grounded metallic pieces.<br>

30 	Figure 10 is a diagrammatic cross-section of a further alternative plasma generating device<br>
	for use in the apparatus of Figure 1<br>
	[0025] The plasma can in general be any type of non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure<br>
	plasma such as a dielectric barrier discharge plasma, a corona discharge, a diffuse dielectric<br>
35	 barrier discharge or a glow discharge plasma. A diffuse dielectric barrier discharge plasma<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
8<br>
	or glow discharge plasma is preferred. Preferred processes are "low temperature" plasmas<br>
	wherein the term "low temperature" is intended to mean below 200°C, and preferably below<br>
	100 °C. These are plasmas where collisions are relatively infrequent (when compared to<br>
	thermal equilibrium plasmas such as flame based systems) which have their constituent<br>
5	 species at widely different temperatures (hence the general name "non-thermal equilibrium"<br>
	plasmas).<br>
	[0026] One preferred device according to the invention for generating a non-equilibrium<br>
	atmospheric pressure plasma has only a single electrode. Despite the lack of a counter<br>
10	 electrode, the device still gives rise to a non-equilibrium plasma flame. The presence of a<br>
	powered electrode in the vicinity of a working gas such as helium is sufficient to generate a<br>
	strong RF field which can give rise to a plasma ionisation process and forms an external<br>
	plasma jet.<br>
15 	[0027] One example of such a device having only a single electrode is shown in Figure 1.<br>
	This design consists of a tube (7), surrounded by a suitable dielectric material (8). The tube<br>
	(7) extends beyond the dielectric housing (8). The process gas, optionally containing an<br>
	atomized surface treatment agent, enters an opening (6). A single electrode (5) is placed<br>
	outside the tube and this is encased in a layer of the dielectric material (8). The electrode is<br>
20	 connected to a suitable power supply. No counter electrode is required. When power is<br>
	applied, local electric fields form around the electrode. These interact with the gas within the<br>
	tube and a plasma is formed, which extends to and beyond an aperture (9) at the end of<br>
	tube (7).<br>
25 	[0028] In an alternative design having improved capability to form nitrogen plasma jets as<br>
	well as helium and argon plasma jets, and improved firing of the plasma, a bare metal<br>
	electrode is used. A single, preferably sharp, electrode is housed within a dielectric housing<br>
	such as a plastic tube through which the process gas and optionally an aerosol (atomised<br>
	surface treatment agent) flow. As power is applied to the needle electrode, an electric field<br>
30	 forms and the process gas is ionised.<br>
	[0029] This can be better understood by referring to Figure 2. This shows a metal<br>
	electrode (12) housed within a suitable chamber (10). This chamber may be constructed<br>
	from a suitable dielectric material such as polytetrafluoroethylene. The process gas and<br>
35	 aerosol enter into the chamber through one or more apertures (11) in the housing. As an<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	* PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
9<br>
	electric potential is applied to the electrode, the process gas becomes ionised, and the<br>
	resultant plasma is directed so that it extends out through an opening (14) of an exit pipe<br>
	(13). By adjusting the size and shape of the exit pipe (13), the size, shape and length of the<br>
	plasma flame can be adjusted.<br>
5<br>
	[0030] The use of a metal electrode with a sharp point facilitates plasma formation. As an<br>
	electric potential is applied to the electrode, an electric field is generated which accelerates<br>
	charged particles in the gas forming a plasma. The sharp point aids the process, as the<br>
	electric field density is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the electrode. The<br>
10	 electrode can also give rise to a leakage of electrons into the gas due to the high secondary<br>
	electron emission coefficient of the metal. As the process gas moves past the electrode, the<br>
	plasma species are carried away from the electrode to form a plasma jet.<br>
	[0031] In a still further embodiment of the present invention the plasma jet device consists<br>
15	 of a single hollow electrode, without any counter electrode. A gas is blown through the<br>
	centre of the electrode. RF power is applied and this leads to the formation of strong<br>
	electro-magnetic fields in the vicinity of the electrode. This causes the gas to ionise and a<br>
	plasma forms which is carried through the electrode and exits as a plasma flame. The<br>
	narrow nature of this design allows forfocussed, narrow plasmas to be generated under<br>
20	 ambient conditions for depositing functional coatings on a three-dimensionally shaped<br>
	substrate.<br>
	[0032] More generally, the electrode or electrodes can take the form of pins, plates,<br>
	concentric tubes or rings, or needles via which gas can be introduced into the apparatus. A<br>
25	 single electrode can be used, or a plurality of electrodes can be used. The electrodes can<br>
	be covered by a dielectric, or not covered by a dielectric. If multiple electrodes are used,<br>
	they can be a combination of dielectric covered and non-covered electrodes. One electrode<br>
	can be grounded or alternatively no electrodes are grounded (floating potential). If no<br>
	electrodes are grounded, the electrodes can have the same polarity or can have opposing<br>
30	 polarity. A co-axial electrode configuration can be used in which a first electrode is placed<br>
	co-axially inside a second electrode. One electrode is powered and the other may be<br>
	grounded, and dielectric layers can be included to prevent arcing, but this configuration is<br>
	less preferred.<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
10<br>
	[0033] The electrode may be made of any suitable metal and can for example be in the<br>
	form of a metal pin e.g. a welding rod, or a flat section.<br>
	[0034] Electrodes can be coated or incorporate a radioactive element to enhance<br>
	 5 ionisation of the plasma. A radioactive metal may be used, for example the electrode can be<br>
	formed from tungsten containing 0.2 to 20% by weight, preferably about 2%, radioactive<br>
	thorium. This promotes plasma formation through the release of radioactive particles and<br>
	radiation which can initiate ionisation. Such a doped electrode provides more efficient<br>
	secondary electron emission and therefore device is easy to strike.<br>
10<br>
	[0035] The power supply to the electrode or electrodes is a radio frequency power supply<br>
	as known for plasma generation, that is in the range 1kHz to 300GHz. Our most preferred<br>
	range is the very low frequency (VLF) 3kHz - 30 kHz band, although the low frequency (LF)<br>
	30kHz - 300 kHz range can also be used successfully. One suitable power supply is the<br>
15	 Haiden Laboratories Inc. PHF-2K unit which is a bipolar pulse wave, high frequency and<br>
	high voltage generator. It has a faster rise and fall time (
	high frequency power supplies. Therefore, it offers better ion generation and greater<br>
	process efficiency. The frequency of the unit is also variable (1 - 100 kHz) to match the<br>
	plasma system. The voltage of the power supply is preferably at least 1kV up to 10kV or<br>
20	 more.<br>
	[0036] When the PHF-2K power supply was connected to the single electrode design of<br>
	plasma generating device shown in Figure 1 and a range of experiments were carried out, it<br>
	was found that stable helium and argon plasma jets were readily formed. In order to<br>
25	 generate an argon flame, it was found to be much easier to fire a helium plasma jet and then<br>
	switch over to argon. When the PHF-2K power supply was connected to the single<br>
	electrode design of plasma generating device shown in Figure 2, it was possible to produce<br>
	plasma jets using a range of process gases, including helium, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, air<br>
	and mixtures of said gases.<br>
30<br>
	[0037] The dielectric housing can be of any electrically non-conductive, e.g. plastics,<br>
	material. For example in the device of Figure 2 a single sharp electrode is housed within a<br>
	plastic tube, for example of polyamide, polypropylene or PTFE, through which the aerosol<br>
	and process gas flow.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
11<br>
	[0038] When using the device of Figure 1, the choice of dielectric material for tube (7) was<br>
	found to have an important influence. When polyamide was used as the dielectric material,<br>
	the plasma rapidly became too hot and the pipe overheated. Similar problems were<br>
	encountered with polypropylene. Replacing the polyamide with PTFE removed this problem.<br>
5	 A rigid dielectric can be used for the tube (7) or for the housing (8) or (10) by replacing the<br>
	plastic with alumina.<br>
	[0039] In general the process gas used to produce the plasma can be selected from a<br>
	range of process gases, including helium, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, air and mixtures of said<br>
10	 gases with each other or with other materials. Most preferably the process gas comprises<br>
	an inert gas substantially consisting of helium, argon and/or nitrogen, that is to say<br>
	comprising at least 90% by volume, preferably at least 95%, of one of these gases or a<br>
	mixture of two or more of them, optionally with up to 5 or 10% of another gas or entrained<br>
	liquid droplets or powder particles.<br>
15<br>
	[0040] In general, plasmas can be fired at lower voltages using helium as process gas than<br>
	with argon and at lower voltages using argon than with nitrogen or air. Using the sharp<br>
	electrode device of Figure 2, pure argon plasmas can be directly ignited at 3 kV using the<br>
	PHF-2K power supply. If a blunt metal electrode is used in place of the sharp electrode in<br>
20	 the apparatus of Figure 2, then an argon plasma can be fired at 5 kV. With the single<br>
	electrode design of Figure 1, a voltage of at least 6.5 kV is required.<br>
	[0041] The use of a length of tubing extending outwardly from the outlet of the dielectric<br>
	housing allows a flame-like non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma discharge to be<br>
25	 stabilized over considerable distances. Using such a system, it is possible to create a flame-<br>
	like discharge that extends for at least 150mm or even over 300 mm. The system can be<br>
	used to treat conductive or semiconductive substrates, even grounded electrically<br>
	conductive substrates such as metallic pieces. In the apparatus of Figure 1 that portion of<br>
	the tube (9) extending beyond the housing (8) acts as the tube extending the plasma flame.<br>
30	In the apparatus of Figure 2 the exit pipe (13) acts as the tube extending the plasma flame.<br>
	Use of a sufficiently long tube allows the discharge generated by the plasma can be<br>
	extended for a distance of over one metre in length by confining the plasma within the tube.<br>
	The powered electrodes are kept at a sufficient distance from the grounded substrate to<br>
	prevent an arc from forming.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
12<br>
	[0042] The tube extending the plasma flame is formed at least partly of dielectric material<br>
	such as plastics, for example polyamide, polypropylene or PTFE. The tube is preferably<br>
	flexible so that the plasma outlet can be moved relative to the substrate. In order to stabilise<br>
	the plasma jet over lengths greater than 300mm, it is beneficial to use conductive cylinders,<br>
5	 preferably with sharp edges, to connect adjacent pieces of pipe. These cylinders are<br>
	preferably not grounded. Preferably, these rings have a round sharp edge on both sides.<br>
	As it passes inside these metal cylinders, the process gas- is in contact with metal. The free<br>
	electrons created inside the plasma region induce a strong electric field near sharp<br>
	conductive edges that ionize further the process gas inside the pipe. The sharp edge on the<br>
0	other side of the cylinder creates a strong electric field that initiates the ionization of the gas<br>
	in the following pipe section. In this way the plasma inside the pipe is extended. Use of<br>
	multiple metal connectors enables the plasma to be extended over several metres, for<br>
	example 3 to 7 metres. There is a limit on the maximum length of plasma that can be<br>
	obtained due to the voltage drop caused by the resistance of the plasma to the current<br>
5	 passage.<br>
	[0043] The apparatus of Figure 2 was used with and without a tube or pipe (13) extending<br>
10	0mm beyond the housing (10) to demonstrate the quality of the plasma jet with each<br>
	plasma gas. In order to directly compare different gases, a set of standard conditions were<br>
	:0 chosen and the properties of each plasma jet were evalusted for each gas. The results are<br>
	shown in Table 1 below. The helium jet is the most stable and coldest plasma, though there<br>
	is very little difference when compared to argon. Nitrogen and air plasmas are less stable<br>
	and run at higher temperatures.<br><br>
Process Gas	Length of Jet	Length of Jet in tube	Temperature<br>
Helium	20 mm	&gt; 200 mm	
Argon	20 mm	&gt; 200 mm	
Nitrogen	15 mm	30 mm	&gt;70°C<br>
Air	4 mm	10 mm	&gt;70°C<br>
25 	Table 1 Effect of process gas on plasma jet properties<br>
	[0044] As can be seen from Table 1, the use of a tube extending outwardly from the outlet<br>
	of the dielectric housing extends the length of the plasma jet considerably. The length of a<br>
	helium or argon plasma jet is extended to over 200mm. (flame extended beyond the end of<br>
30	0 tube (13)). This could be extended further by use of a longer tube. The length of a nitrogen<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
13<br>
	plasma jet using the tube (13) was longer than a helium or argon plasma jet without tube<br>
	(13).<br>
	[0045] In many preferred processes for plasma treating a surface, the plasma contains an<br>
5	 atomised surface treatment agent. For example, when a polymerisable precursor is<br>
	introduced into the plasma jet, preferably as an aerosol, a controlled plasma polymerisation<br>
	reaction occurs which results in the deposition of a plasma polymer on any substrate which<br>
	is placed adjacent to the plasma outlet of the tube. Using the process of the invention, a<br>
	range of functional coatings have been deposited onto numerous substrates. These<br>
10	 coatings are grafted to the substrate and retain the functional chemistry of the precursor<br>
	molecule.<br>
	[0046] Figure 3 shows a modified version of the pin type electrode system shown in Figure<br>
	2. In Figure 3, the process gas enters upstream (15) of the plasma. An atomised surface<br>
15	 treatment agent can be incorporated in the flow of process gas (15). In an alternative<br>
	design, the aerosol of atomised surface treatment agent is introduced directly into the<br>
	plasma. This is achieved by having a second gas entry point (16) located close to the tip of<br>
	the electrode (17). The aerosol can be added directly at this point (16), with the main<br>
	process gas still entering upstream of the plasma region (15). Alternatively, some (or all) of<br>
20	 the process gas can also be added with the aerosol adjacent to the tip of the electrode.<br>
	Using this setup, the plasma and precursor exit though a suitable tube (18) extending from<br>
	the outlet of the dielectric housing surrounding the electrode (17).<br>
	[0047] Figure 4 shows a preferred device which generates long plasmas for the treatment<br>
25	 of conducting substrates or of the inside of 3-d objects or tubes. As in Figure 3, a powered<br>
	electrode (19) interacts with a process gas (20) and aerosol (21) to produce a plasma. The<br>
	length of the plasma is extended by confining the plasma to a tube (22) as it leaves the<br>
	device. As long as the plasma is confined within this tube, then the plasma is not quenched<br>
	by interaction with the external atmosphere. In order to further extend the plasma length,<br>
30	 conductive pieces (23) are incorporated into the tube (22) to connect adjacent pieces of the<br>
	tube. The conductive metal rings (23) have a round sharp edge on both sides. The resulting<br>
	plasma may be extended over a considerable distance before exiting through plasma outlet<br>
	(24).<br><br>

	[0048] Figure 5 is a view of an apparatus of the type described in Figure 4 in use. Arg on is<br>
	used as process gas and the plasma flame extends beyond the outlet (24) of tube (22).<br>
	Figure 6 is a view of the apparatus of Figure 5 with the argon plasma flame being used to<br>
	treat a metal substrate (25). There is no arcing between the electrode (19) and the metal<br>
5	 substrate (25). Figure 7 is a view of the same apparatus in use with helium as process gas.<br>
	An even longer tube (22) is used and the flame still extends beyond the outlet (24).<br>
	[0049] The plasma preferably contains an atomized surface treatment agent. The<br>
	atomised surface treatment agent can for example be a polymerisable precursor. When a<br>
10	 polymerisable precursor is introduced into the plasma jet, preferably as an aerosol, a<br>
	controlled plasma polymerisation reaction occurs which results in the deposition of a plasma<br>
	polymer on any substrate which is placed adjacent to the plasma outlet. Using the process<br>
	of the invention, a range of functional coatings have been deposited onto numerous<br>
	substrates. These coatings are grafted to the substrate and retain the functional chemistry<br>
15	 of the precursor molecule.<br>
	[0050] An advantage of using a diffuse dielectric barrier discharge or an atmospheric<br>
	pressure glow discharge assembly for the plasma treating step of the present invention as<br>
	compared with the prior art is that both liquid and solid atomised polymerisable monomers<br>
20	 may be used to form substrate coatings, due to the method of the present invention talcing<br>
	place under conditions of atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, the polymerisable monomers<br>
	can be introduced into the plasma discharge or resulting stream in the absence of a carrier<br>
	gas. The precursor monomers can be introduced directly by, for example, direct injection,<br>
	whereby the monomers are injected directly into the plasma.<br>
25<br>
	[0051] it is to be understood that the surface treatment agent in accordance with the<br>
	present invention is a precursor material which is reactive within the atmospheric press are<br>
	plasma or as part of a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PE-CVD) process and<br>
	can be used to make any appropriate coating, including, for example, a material which can<br>
30	 be used to grow a film or to chemically modify an existing surface. The present invention<br>
	may be used to form many different types of coatings. The type of coating which is formed<br>
	on a substrate is determined by the coating-forming material(s) used, and the present<br>
	method may be used to (co)polymerise coating-forming monomer material(s) onto a<br>
	substrate surface.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
15<br>
	[0052] The coating-forming material may be organic or inorganic, solid, liquid or gaseous,<br>
	or mixtures thereof. Suitable organic coating-forming materials include carboxylates,<br>
	methacrylates, acrylates, styrenes, methacrylonitriles, alkenes and dienes, for example<br>
	methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and other<br>
5	 alkyl methacrylates, and the corresponding acrylates, including organofunctional<br>
	methacrylates and acrylates, including poly(ethyleneglycol) acrylates and methacrylates,<br>
	glycidyl methacrylate, trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate, ally! methacrylate, hydroxyethyl<br>
	methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylates, and fluoroalkyl<br>
	(meth)acrylates, for example heptadecylfluorodecyl acrylate (HDFDA) of the formula<br><br>
10<br>
or pentafluorobutyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, fumaric acid and esters, itaconic<br>
	acid (and esters), maleic anhydride, styrene, α-methy!styrene, halogenated alkenes, for<br>
	example, vinyl halides, such as vinyl chlorides and vinyl fluorides, and fluorinated alkenes,<br>
	for example perfluoroalkenes, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, allyl<br>
15	 amine, vinylidene halides, butadienes, acrylamide, such as N-isopropylacrylamide,<br>
	methacrylamide, epoxy compounds, for example glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, glycidol,<br>
	styrene oxide, butadiene monoxide, ethyleneglycol diglycidylether, glycidyl methacrylate,<br>
	bisphenol A diglycidylether (and its oligomers), vinylcyclohexene oxide, conducting polymers<br>
	such as pyrrole and thiophene and their derivatives, and phosphorus-containing compounds,<br>
20	 for example dimethylallylphosphonate. The coating forming material may also comprise<br>
	acryl-functional organosiloxanes and/or silanes.<br>
	[0053] Suitable inorganic coating-forming materials include metals and metal oxides,<br>
	including colloidal metals. Organometallic compounds may also be suitable coating-forming<br>
25	 materials, including metal alkoxides such as titanates, tin alkoxides, zirconates and<br>
	alkoxides of germanium and erbium. We have found that the present invention has<br>
	particular utility in providing substrates with siloxane-based coatings using coating-forming<br>
	compositions comprising silicon-containing materials. Suitable silicon-containing materials<br>
	for use in the method of the present invention include silanes (for example, silane,<br>
30	 alkylsilanes, alkylhalosilanes, alkoxysilanes) and linear (for example, polydimethylsiloxane or<br>
	polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane) and cyclic siloxanes (for example,<br>
	octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), including organo-functional linear and cyclic siloxanes (for<br>
	example, Si-H containing, halo-functional, and haloalkyl-functional linear and cyclic<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
16<br>
	siloxanes, e.g. tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and<br>
	tri(nonofluorobutyl)trimethylcyclotrisiloxane). A mixture of different silicon-containing<br>
	materials may be used, for example to tailor the physical properties of the substrate coating<br>
	for a specified need (e.g. thermal properties, optical properties, such as refractive index, and<br>
5	 viscoelastic properties).<br>
	[0054] The atomiser preferably uses a gas to atomise the surface treatment agent. The<br>
	electrode can be combined with the atomiser within the housing. Most preferably, the<br>
	process gas used for generating the plasma is used as the atomizing gas to atomise the<br>
	0 surface treatment agent. The atomizer can for example be a pneumatic nebuliser,<br>
	particularly a parallel path nebuliser such as that sold by Burgener Research Inc.of<br>
	Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, or that described in US Patent 6634572, or it can be a<br>
	concentric gas atomizer. The atomizer can alternatively be an ultrasonic atomizer in which a<br>
	pump is used to transport the liquid surface treatment agent into an ultrasonic nozzle and<br>
15	 subsequently it forms a liquid film onto an atomising surface. Ultrasonic sound waves cause<br>
	standing waves to be formed in the liquid film, which result in droplets being formed. The<br>
	atomiser preferably produces drop sizes of from 10 to100μm, more preferably from 10 to<br>
	50μm. Suitable atomisers for use in the present invention are ultrasonic nozzles from Sono-<br>
	Tek Corporation, Milton, New York, USA. Alternative atomisers may include for example<br>
20	 electrospray techniques, methods of generating a very fine liquid aerosol through<br>
	electrostatic charging. The most common electrospray apparatus employs a sharply pointed<br>
	hollow metal tube, with liquid pumped through the tube. A high-voltage power supply is<br>
	connected to the outlet of the tube. When the power supply is turned on and adjusted for the<br>
	proper voltage, the liquid being pumped through the tube transforms into a fine continuous<br>
25	 mist of droplets. Inkjet technology can also be used to generate liquid droplets without the<br>
	need of a carrier gas, using thermal, piezoelectric, electrostatic and acoustic methods.<br>
	[0055] In one embodiment of the invention the electrode is combined with the atomizer in<br>
	such a way that the atomizer acts as the electrode. For example, if a parallel path atomizer<br>
30	 is made of conductive material, the entire atomizer device can be used as an electrode.<br>
	Alternatively a conductive component such as a needle can be incorporated into a non-<br>
	conductive atomizer to form the combined electrode-atomiser system.<br>
	[0056] In the apparatus of Figure 8, an atomizing device (31), which can be a pneumatic<br>
35	 nebuliser or an ultrasonic atomizer, is positioned with its exit between two electrodes (32)<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
17<br>
	and (33) within a dielectric housing (34) extending as a tube (34a) at its lower end. The<br>
	housing has an inlet (35) for a process gas such as helium or argon so that the gas flows<br>
	between the electrodes (32, 33) approximately parallel to the atomized liquid from atomizer<br>
	(31). A non-equilibrium plasma flame (36) extends from the electrodes (32, 33) beyond the<br>
5	 outlet of the tube (34a). A metal substrate (37), backed by a dielectric sheet (38) and a<br>
	grounded metal support (39), is positioned adjacent the flame (36) at the outlet of the tube<br>
	(34a). When a polymerisable surface treatment agent is atomized in atomizer (31) and a<br>
	radio frequency high voltage is applied to electrodes (32, 33), the substrate (37) is treated<br>
	with a plasma polymerized coating.<br>
10<br>
	[0057] In the apparatus of Figure 9, a process gas inlet (41) and an atomizing device (42)<br>
	both feed into a dielectric housing (43), having a tube (46) extending from its outlet, so that<br>
	the process gas and the atomized liquid flow approximately parallel. The atomizing device<br>
	(42) has gas and liquid inlets and is formed of electrically conductive material such as metal.<br>
15	 A radio frequency high voltage is applied to the atomizer (42) so that it acts as an electrode<br>
	and a plasma jet (44) is formed extending to the outlet of the tube (46). A substrate (45) is<br>
	positioned adjacent to the outlet of the tube (46) to be plasma treated with the surface<br>
	treatment agent atomized in atomizer (42).<br>
20 	[0058] In the apparatus of Figure 10, an electrode (51) is positioned within a housing (56)<br>
	having a tube (55) extending from its outlet. A process gas inlet (52) and an aerosol (53)<br>
	both feed into the housing in the region of the electrode (51). When a polymerisable surface<br>
	treatment agent is atomized in aerosol (53) and a radio frequency high voltage is applied to<br>
	electrode (51), a plasma flame is formed extending to the outlet of the tube (55), and a<br>
25	 substrate (54) positioned adjacent the outlet is treated with a plasma polymerized coating.<br>
	[0059] The apparatus of the present invention may include a plurality of atomisers, which<br>
	may be of particular utility, for example, where the apparatus is to be used to form a<br>
	copolymer coating on a substrate from two different coating-forming materials, where the<br>
30	 monomers are immiscible or are in different phases, e.g. the first is a solid and the second is<br>
	a gas or liquid.<br>
	[0061] The plasma apparatus and processes of the present invention as hereinbefore<br>
	described may be used for plasma treating any suitable substrate, including complex shaped<br>
35	objects. Applications include coating 3D objects such as tubing or bottles or coatings on<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
18<br>
	the inside of a bottle particularly barrier coatings. Examples include medical devices and<br>
	implants, including the internal and external coating/treatment of catheters, drug delivery<br>
	devices, dosage devices, clinical diagnostics, implants such as cardio and prosthetic<br>
	implants, syringes, needles, particularly hypodermic needles, walls and flooring, woundcare<br>
5	 products, tubing including medical tubing, powders and particles. Other applications include<br>
	coating complex shaped components such as electronic components, or print adhesion<br>
	enhancement, or the coating of wire, cable or fibres. The system can be used as a focused<br>
	plasma to enable creation of patterned surface treatments.<br>
10 	[0062] Furthermore a plasma jet device may be used to treat the internal wall of a pipe or<br>
	other three dimensional body by transporting the discharge, generated by the formation of a<br>
	plasma by an electrode system in accordance with the present invention, down a tube,<br>
	preferably made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), of the type shown in Figure 3 or 4. This<br>
	PTFE tube is placed inside the pipe which is to be coated. A plasma is activated and where<br>
15	 appropriate a coating precursor material is injected into the plasma in the form of a gas or<br>
	aerosol or the like. The PTFE or like tube is gradually drawn through the pipe/tubing, whilst<br>
	depositing a uniform coating on the internal surface of the pipe. To improve the coating<br>
	uniformity, either the PTFE tube or the pipe/tubing may be rotated. The device can be small<br>
	and portable, with a low cost replaceable nozzle for ease of cleaning/maintenance.<br>
20<br>
	[0063] Three dimensional products which may require internal coatings include packaging<br>
	products such as bottles, containers, caps and closures, boxes, cartons, pouches and blister<br>
	packs, and profiled and preformed plastics and laminates.<br>
25 	[0064] Electronics equipment which may be coated using the apparatus and process of the<br>
	invention includes textile and fabric based electronics printed circuit boards, displays<br>
	including flexible displays, and electronic components such as resistors, diodes, capacitors,<br>
	transistors, light emitting diodes (leds), organic leds, laser diodes, integrated circuits (ic), ic<br>
	die, ic chips, memory devices logic devices, connectors, keyboards, semiconductor<br>
30	 substrates, solar cells and fuel cells. Optical components such as lenses, contact lenses<br>
	and other optical substrates may similarly be treated. Other applications include military,<br>
	aerospace or transport equipment, for example gaskets, seals, profiles, hoses, electronic<br>
	and diagnostic components, household articles including kitchen, bathroom and cookware,<br>
	office furniture and laboratory ware.<br>

	[0065] Using a small hypodermic type needle will generate a microbore thin stable<br>
	discharge to facilitate activating and coating very precise areas of a body - e.g. electrical<br>
	components. Wide area coatings can be achieved by offsetting devices.<br>
5 	[0066] Any suitable coatings may be applied using the apparatus and process of the<br>
	invention, for example coatings for surface activation, anti-microbial, friction reduction<br>
	(lubricant), bio-compatible, corrosion resistant, oleophobic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, barrier,<br>
	self cleaning, trapped actives and print adhesion.<br>
10 	[0067] Trapped active materials may be applied on to substrate surfaces by means of the<br>
	present equipment and processes. The term 'active material(s)' as used herein is intended<br>
	to mean one or more materials that perform one or more specific functions when present in a<br>
	certain environment. They are chemical species which do not undergo chemical bond<br>
	forming reactions within a plasma environment. It is to be appreciated that an active<br>
15	 material is clearly discriminated from the term "reactive"; a reactive material or chemical<br>
	species is intended to mean a species which undergoes chemical bond forming reactions<br>
	within a plasma environment. The active may of course be capable of undergoing a reaction<br>
	after the coating process.<br>
20 	[0068] Any suitable active material may be utilised providing it substantially does not<br>
	undergo chemical bond forming reactions within a plasma. Examples of suitable active<br>
	materials include anti-microbials (for example, quaternary ammonium and silver based),<br>
	enzymes, proteins, DNA/RNA, pharmaceutical materials, UV screen, anti-oxidant, flame<br>
	retardant, cosmetic, therapeutic or diagnostic materials antibiotics, anti-bacterials, anti-<br>
25	 fungals, cosmetics, cleansers, growth factors, aloe, and vitamins, fragrances &amp; flavours;<br>
	agrochemicals (pheromones, pesticides, herbicides), dyestuffs and pigments, for example<br>
	photochromic dyestuffs and pigments and catalysts.<br>
	[0069] The chemical nature of the active material(s) used in the present invention is/ are<br>
30	 generally not critical. They can comprise any solid or liquid material which can be bound in<br>
	the composition and where appropriate subsequently released at a desired rate.<br>
	[0070] The invention is illustrated by the following Examples<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
20<br>
	Example 1<br>
	[0071] Using the apparatus of Figure 8, fluorocarbon coatings were deposited onto a range<br>
5	of substrates from pentafluorobutyl acrylate CH2=CH-COO-CH2CH2CF2CF3 as precursor.<br>
	The substrate was positioned adjacent to the plasma flame outlet (24) of tube (22) and the<br>
	tube was moved across the substrate. A fluorocarbon coating was deposited onto glass<br>
	using the following conditions; power supply 550 W, 14.8kV, 100 kHz; process gas flow (15)<br>
	20 standard litres per minute (slm) Argon containing 2.5 μl/min of the fluorocarbon precursor<br>
10	 surface treatment agent. The plasma jet was quite cold (less than 40°C), and gives rise to a<br>
	soft polymerisation process. Although coatings could be deposited at higher fluorocarbon<br>
	concentrations, we found that the use of low precursor flows such as 1 to 5 or 10 μI/min<br>
	produced the best coatings. The coating deposited was oleophobic and hydrophobic.<br>
15 	[0072] Using the same conditions, hydrophobic and oleophobic fluorocarbon coatings were<br>
	deposited onto plastic (polypropylene film), metal and ceramic (silica) substrates.<br>
	Example 2.<br>
20 	[0073] Example 1 was repeated using helium in place of argon at the same flow rates.<br>
	Hydrophobic and oleophobic fluorocarbon coatings were plasma deposited onto plastic,<br>
	glass, metal and ceramic substrates.<br>
	Example 3<br>
25<br>
	[0074] Examples 1 and 2 were repeated using HDFDA as the fluorocarbon precursor<br>
	surface treatment agent. Hydrophobic and oleophobic fluorocarbon coatings were plasma<br>
	deposited onto all the substrates. The coatings deposited onto polished metal discs were<br>
	evaluated as low friction coatings. A pin on disc method was used to evaluate the friction<br>
30	 and wear characteristics of the coating. A tungsten carbide pin was used with a 50g load.<br>
	The sample to be tested was placed in contact with the pin and the sample rotates. By<br>
	monitoring the friction versus the number of revolutions, the wear rate can be deduced. The<br>
	coatings displayed significant resistance to abrasion.<br><br>
WO 2006/048650	PCT/GB2005/004246<br>
21<br>
	Example 4<br>
	[0075] The process of Example 1 was repeated using polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane in<br>
5	 place of the fluorocarbon as the surface treatment agent for polypropylene film. This<br>
	produced a coating with a water contact angle in excess of 130°. FTIR analysis showed that<br>
	the coating retained the functional chemistry of the precursor, with the reactive Si-H<br>
	functional group giving rise to a peak at 2165 cm-1. <br>
10	Example 5<br>
	[0076] The process of Example 4 was repeated using polyethylene glycol (PEG)<br>
	methacrylate in place of the siloxane. This produced a hydrophilic coating of poly (PEG<br>
	methacrylate) on the polypropylene film.<br>
