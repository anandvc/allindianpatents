HAIR CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
HAIR CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to hair conditioning compositions which comprise a fatty acid and a water-soluble nonionic polymer.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
Hair conditioning compositions are typically applied to the hair immediately after shampooing and rinsing the hair.  The conditioning composition is worked through the hair, and may then be left to penetrate the hair for a period of time before rinsing it from the hair with water.<br>
Traditionally such conditioning compositions have used a combination of cationic surfactants and fatty materials, typically long chain fatty alcohols.  This combination forms a lamellar gel phase which imparts a desirable viscosity to the product and deposits on the hair during use of the product   to provide a conditioning benefit.<br>
Many consumers desire a "lighter" conditioning product which imparts less of a slippery and coated feel to their hair. This has led to the development of "low-fat" formulations with a reduced content of fatty material.<br>
However, reducing the content of fatty material can also reduce the viscosity of the product to an unacceptable<br><br>
level. Consequently, it has been found to be necessary to incorporate a thickener.<br>
Examples of thickeners which have been used for this purpose are nonionic cellulose ethers such as hydroxyethylcellulose.<br>
Hydrophobically-modified cellulose ethers such as cetyl hydroxyethylcellulose have also been used. Materials of this type are described in EP 412 705, EP 412 706 and EP 412 710 as providing a rheology very much like the gel-network structure of typical hair conditioners without the slimy feel associated with most polymeric thickeners, and without using a typical quaternary ammonium compound/fatty alcohol gel-network thickening system.<br>
A problem associated with hair conditioning compositions such as those described above is that it is difficult to obtain the right viscosity profile under different conditions of product usage. For example, a thick, creamy product viscosity is desirable to enable controlled pouring and product dosage onto the hair. However, in order to facilitate spreading of the product through the hair and rinsing, it is desirable that the product viscosity breaks down rapidly on dilution. If the product is difficult to rinse from the hair, then this may contribute to sensory negatives perceived by the consumer such as a dirty, "coated" hair feel after use.<br>
The inventors have found that this problem can be solved by incorporating a fatty acid and a water-soluble, nonionic<br><br>
polymer of alkylene oxide into the hair conditioning composition.<br>
JP2002226327 describes a hair cosmetic which is readily pourable, which has a rich product feel on the hand, and which provides a smooth hair feel after rinsing and drying. The cosmetic incorporates a higher fatty acid having a hydroxyl group in a side chain, such as 12-hydroxystearic acid.<br>
DE19641841 describes an aqueous composition comprising 10 to 26C fatty acid, in combination with directly acting hair dye and certain alcohol or glycol ether solvents. The composition is said to provide good conditioning and hair dyeing effects.<br>
W099/44568 relates to the use of water-soluble nonionic polyethyleneoxide homopolymers to increase hair body and fullness when formulated in a high pH medium and applied to fine hair. They are said to deposit under the hair cuticle and provide it with more surface roughness and texture.<br>
WO95/20939 describes thickened cream rinse emulsions with a combination of low melting point fatty alcohol with polyethyleneoxide homopolymers.  The emulsions are said to provide excellent wet hair feel, spreadability, and rinseability, as well as providing glossiness, hair alignment, and volume reduction, and especially dry combing benefits.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The emulsion droplets may typically have a Sauter mean droplet diameter (03,2) in the composition of the invention ranging from 0.01 to 20 micrometer,, more preferably from 0-2 to 10 micrometer.<br>

In such materials, the silicone emulsion droplets are preferably formed from polydiorganosiloxanes such as those described above. One preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
HO [CH2CH20] X [CH (CH3) CH20] y [CH2CH2O] X H<br>
wherein the mean value of x is 4 or more and the mean value of y is 25 or more.<br>
Another preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
(HO [CH2CH20] a [CH (CH3) CH20] b) 2-N-CH2-CH2-N ( [OCH2CH (CH3) ]b[OCH3CH2] a0H) 2<br>
wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is S or more.<br>

Generally, the composition is applied to the hair (preferably hair which has been shampooed and then rinsed with water), and then worked through the hair. Preferably the composition is then left to penetrate the hair for a period of about one to three minutes before rinsing it from the hair with water.<br>

Example	Log (Neat Viscosity)- Log (Viscosity at 1 in 4 Dilution)<br>
A	1.27<br>
B	2.31<br>
1	5.31<br>
C	2.01<br>
D	3.91<br>
2	5.38<br>
3	5.52<br>
4	5.54<br>
The results show that the Examples according to the invention (1 and 2) give a faster viscosity drop on dilution, when compared to Comparative Examples (A, B, C, D) with equivalent cationic surfactant bases.  The compositions according to the invention (1 to 4) have a viscosity which breaks down rapidly on dilution. This effect facilitates fast rinsing of the product from the hair by the consumer. The effect is observed for compositions of the invention over a range of different cationic surfactant bases and molecular weights of the polyethylene glycol polymer.<br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.   A hair conditioning composition comprising an aqueous carrier, a lamellar gel phase formed from cationic surfactant and fatty material and a rheology modifier for the lamellar gel phase which comprises a fatty acid and a water-soluble, nonionic polymer of alkylene oxide of the general formula:<br>
H(OCH2CHR)n OH<br>
in which R is H, methyl, or mixtures thereof, and n has an average value of at least 150.<br>
2.       A hair conditioning composition according to claim 1, in which the cationic surfactant is a quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant corresponding to the following general formula (I):<br>
[N(R1 (R2) (R3) (R4)]+ (X)-	(I)<br>
in which R1, R2, R3, and R4 are each independently selected from (a) an aliphatic group of from 1 to 22 carbon atoms, or (b) an aromatic, alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to 22 carbon atoms; and X is a salt-forming anion such as those selected from halogen, (e.g. chloride, bromide), acetate, citrate, lactate, glycolate, phosphate nitrate, sulphate, and alkylsulphate radicals.<br><br>
3.   A hair conditioning composition according to claim 1, in which the cationic surfactant is a salt of an amine corresponding to the following general formula (II):<br>
R1 - C(O) - N(H)- R2 - N(R3) (R4)	(II)<br>
in which R1 is a fatty acid chain containing from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene group containing from one to four carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 are, independently, an alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms.<br>
4.	A hair conditioning composition according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which the fatty acid has the general formula CH3 (CH2) n COOH, where n is an integer from 14 to 20.<br>
5.	A hair conditioning composition according to any one of claims 1 to 4, in which R is H, and n has an average value of from about 150 to about 235,000.<br>
6-   A hair conditioning composition according to claim 5, in which the fatty material is a fatty alcohol of general formula CH3(CH2)nOH, where n is an integer from 7 to 29.<br></td>
