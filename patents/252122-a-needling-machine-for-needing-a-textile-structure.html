				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates a needling machine for needing a textile<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of needled textile structures and it relates more particularly to a device for automatically removing such structures after they have been needled in a circular type needling machine.<br>
Prior art<br>
In circular type needling machines, the annular preform for needling is placed on a needling table which is rotated by drive means.  This gives rise to a particular difficulty with removing the preform once needling has been completed, particularly when preform production is to be performed automatically without manual intervention.  The present practice consists essentially in lowering the table at the end of manufacture so as to enable an operator to extract manually the preform made in this way from the machine.<br>
Object and definition of the invention<br>
The present invention thus seeks to solve this specific problem with a needling machine that includes a device for automatically removing preforms.  An object of the invention is also to provide such a device without significantly altering the initial structure of a circular type needling machine, and in particular while remaining within the same general size.<br>
These objects are achieved by a needling machine for needling a textile structure built up from a helical strip delivered by strip supply means, the machine comprising a needling table that is vertically movable, a needling head including a determined number of barbed needles and placed over said needling table in a needling zone, and driven with vertical reciprocating motion,<br>
cutting means for cutting said strip once a predetermined thickness for said textile structure has been obtained, and conical roller drive means for rotating said strip on said needling table until a textile structure has been built up with said predetermined thickness, the machine being characterized in that at least a fraction of said conical roller drive means is movable so as to be retracted to release an empty space over said needling table enabling ejector means to remove said textile structure from said needling table.<br>
Thus, with this particular structure, once needled preforms have been made, they can be removed easily and automatically.<br>
In a particular embodiment, said ejector means may comprise thrust means placed level with said needling table, said thrust means possibly comprising either an actuator or a pivoting fork whose thrust tine acts directly on the periphery of said textile structure, or else a manipulator arm provided with gripping means for taking hold of said textile structure and removing it from said needling table.<br>
Preferably, at least one of said conical roller drive means is mounted on a support tray capable of sliding on a rail extending transversely to the thrust direction of said thrust means and includes motor means enabling it to be moved along the rail.  Advantageously, the motor means include an electrically controlled actuator.  In an alternative embodiment, the rail extends following a circular arc from an initial drive position.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the present invention appear better from the following description given by way of non-limiting indication and made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is an elevation view of a needling<br>
machine including an automatic preform removal device of<br>
the invention;<br>
-	Figures 2A and 2B are plan views showing two<br>
distinct embodiments of the Figure 1 device; and<br>
-	Figure 3 is a plan view showing another embodiment<br>
of the device of the invention.<br>
Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram showing a circular type needling machine having a smooth table (but it would naturally also be possible to apply the invention to a machine having a brush table) for use in needling a textile structure or annular preform, the machine being provided with a device of the invention for automatically removing the structure after it has been needled.<br>
Conventionally, such a textile structure 10 for needling in a needling machine is made up of a plurality of superposed layers, which in circular needling are delivered continuously from helical strip supply means 12 of the kind described in greater detail in the patent application filed on the same day by the present Applicant and to which reference should be made.<br>
The helical strip of woven or non-woven fabric which is unwound progressively as it advances comes into position on a needling table 14 forming a winding platen for said strip that is vertically movable by vertical transmission means 16, and it is then driven on said table by drive means 18a, 18b, 18c advantageously constituted by three conical rollers 20a, 20b, 20c each actuated by an independent motor and gear box unit 22a, 22b, 22c, and preferably disposed at 120Â° intervals.  The textile strip is needled by a needling head 24 having a determined number of barbed needles and placed over the needling table between two conical drive rollers (e.g. the rollers 20b and 20c).  In order to needle the various layers to one anther, this needling head is driven with<br>
vertical reciprocating motion by conventional drive means 26.  Cutting means 28 are placed upstream from the needling zone to cut the textile strip once a predetermined final thickness has been obtained for the preform (sensors that are not shown serve to monitor this thickness accurately).<br>
Central control means 30 connected to the vertical transmission means 16 for the needling table, to the textile structure drive means 18, to the reciprocating drive means 26 for the head, and to the cutting means 28 serve to provide the necessary control and synchronization for obtaining a continuous needling process.<br>
In the invention, one (20a) of the three conical rollers and the associated motor and gear box unit 22a forming part of the drive means are movable and can be retracted to leave an empty space over the needling table for facilitating the action of ejector means for removing the textile structure from the needling table.  This empty space is preferably established outside (e.g. opposite from) the needling zone.<br>
In a first embodiment (see Figure 2A), the ejector means are placed in said needling zone beneath the needling head, substantially level with the needling table and they can be implemented as a simple actuator 32 whose advantageously telescopic thrust rod 32a acts directly on the periphery 10a of the annular preform so that said preform is pushed off the needling table, e.g. directly onto a conveyor 34 for removing finished products and disposed outside the machine level with the needling table.  The conical roller drive means 18a is advantageously mounted on a support plate 36a which can slide on a rail 36b extending perpendicularly to the thrust direction of the actuator.  It is moved along said rail under the control of the central control means 30 acting via appropriate drive means 38, e.g. an electrically controlled actuator.<br>
In a variant embodiment shown in Figure 2B, the ejector means can be constituted by a manipulator arm 40 provided with extensible terminal grip means 42 for directly taking hold of the annular preform, e.g. through its central opening 10b, and then moving it to the conveyor 34 for evacuation purposes.  The arm is advantageously located off the needling table, but in a region that is nevertheless close to the needling zone so as to avoid using a manipulator arm that is too bulky. Like the preceding thrust actuator, this manipulator arm is under the direct control of the central control means 30 for the needling machine and operates synchronously with the general needling process so as to remove needled preforms automatically.<br>
It will be observed that the manipulator arm can also be used not only instead of but also together with the thrust actuator, particularly when for reasons of available space, for example, the conveyor cannot be placed immediately adjacent to the needling table but is spaced apart from or relatively remote therefrom.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 3, the conical roller drive means 18a is mounted on a support plate 44a slidable on a rail 44b extending in a circular arc in a horizontal plane to a retracted position in which the moving drive means (shown in fine lines) is substantially perpendicular to its initial drive position.  Movement on this rail is controlled by the central control means 30 using suitable drive means 46, e.g. a simple electric motor.  It will be observed that the moving means can be taken out of the way equally well in a vertical plane.<br>
In this alternative embodiment, the thrust means are preferably placed around the needling zone, substantially around the needling table, and can be implemented by a pivoting fork-shaped part 50 which is pivoted directly under the control of the central control means 30 of the needling machine synchronously with the general needling<br>
process and which has a thrust tine 50a acting directly on the periphery 10a of the annular preform so that said preform is pushed off the needling table, e.g. directly onto a conveyor 34 for removing finished products and placed outside the machine, level with the needling table.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
