				<td>THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ACID IN A FISCHER-TROPSCH PROCESS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process wherein an acid is introduced.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
A FT process comprises the hydrogenation of CO in the presence of a catalyst based on metals, such as Fe, Co and Ru. The products formed from this reaction are usually gaseous, liquid and waxy hydrocarbons which may be saturated or unsaturated. Oxygenates of the hydrocarbons such as alcohols, acids, ketones and aldehydes are also formed. The carbon number distribution of the products follow the well-known Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution.<br>
A heterogeneous Fisher-Tropsch process may be conveniently categorised as either a high temperature Fischer-Tropsch (HTFT) process or a low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) process. The HTFT process can be described as a two phase Fischer-Tropsch process. It is usually carried out at a temperature from 250°C to 400°C and the catalyst employed is usually an iron-based catalyst.<br><br>
The LTFT process can be described as a three phase Fischer-Tropsch process. It is usually carried out at a temperature from 220°C to 310°C and the catalyst employed is usually either a Co-based catalyst or a Fe-based catalyst. The conditions under which this process is carried out, results in the products being in a liquid and possibly also in a gas phase in the reactor. Therefore this process can be described as a three phase process, where the reactants are in the gas phase, at least some of the products are in the liquid phase, and the catalyst is in a solid phase in the reaction zone. Generally this process is commercially carried out in a fixed or fluidized bed reactor or a slurry bed reactor.<br>
During FT synthesis (FTS) another reaction, namely the water gas shift (WGS) reaction usually also takes place. The WGS reaction is as follows:<br>
The WGS reaction is not a desired reaction in FTS where the H2/CO molar feed ratio is high, that is above the stoichiometric ratio required for the products to be formed. This is due to the fact that during the WGS reaction CO is converted to unwanted CO2 compared to FTS where CO is converted to hydrocarbons. It will also be appreciated that CO2 production creates environmental problems.<br>
The WGS reaction is especially problematic in a LTFT process in the presence of a Fe-based catalyst, as these reactions are usually carried out<br><br>
between 220 to 270°C. Under these conditions the WGS reaction is not under equilibrium and no effective reverse WGS takes place with the result that COa is not converted back to CO within the LIFT reactor.<br>
It has been observed that during FTS, the WGS activity of a FT catalyst increases over time and an increase in COg selectivity is accordingly also observed.<br>
It has also been observed now, that with an increase in WGS activity (and accordingly COa production) acid production increases. Furthermore, it has been also observed that with increased acid production a lesser degree of olefin isomerisation (internal double bonds/total double bonds) takes place.<br>
In the light of the above it was expected that the addition of an acid to FTS would increase COa production and reduce olefin isomerisation. However, it was most surprisingly found that the addition of an acid to FTS in fact resulted in a decrease in COa selectivity, a decrease in acid selectivity (in at least some cases) and in at least some cases little or no change in olefin isomerisation.<br>
The applicant is not aware of any prior art wherein an acid had been introduced in FTS. This is not surprising as the production of acids via FTS is a major problem. The acids may cause corrosion of mild steel and may cause deactivation and corrosion of hydrotreating catalysts in the downstream refinery. Carboxylates may also cause bed plugging on hydrotreating<br><br>
catalysts. In addition, strict specifications on the acid content of commercial fuels exist.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a three-phase low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) process wherein CO and H2 are converted to hydrocarbons and possibly oxygenates thereof by contacting the CO and H2 with an iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst in a LTFT reactor in the presence of an acid which is introduced into the LTFT reactor.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided the introduction of an acid into a low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) reactor wherein CO and H2 are converted to hydrocarbons and possibly oxygenates thereof by contacting the CO and H2 with an iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst under three phase LTFT process conditions.<br>

In one embodiment of the invention the introduced acid may comprise one or more acids produced by the LTFT process, and such one or more acids may be recycled to the LTFT reactor after separation from products of the LTFT process. Shorter chain acids and acetic acid produced during the LTFT process will report in a water fraction produced by the LTFT process and usually acetic acid will be the most dominant acid. Typically, liquid-liquid extraction can be used to recover the one or more acids from the water fraction, and part of these recovered acids may be recycled to the LTFT reactor to be introduced acid.<br>
The introduced acid may be mixed with a suitable carrier, especially to allow the acid to be introduced in diluted form into the reactor. The carrier may comprise an organic compound, preferably a solvent of the introduced acid. Preferably the carrier comprises one or more organic compounds produced<br><br>

Preferably the carrier is a liquid hydrocarbon. In one embodiment of the invention the carrier may comprise an alkane, preferably a non-branched alkane, preferably n-octane. Alternatively it may be a compound such as acetone.<br>
In use the carrier will be used to control the acid feed rate to the LTFT reactor. The introduced acid may be provided at any suitable concentration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the introduced acid is kept under an inert gas atmosphere to keep oxygen out. The inert gas may be any suitable gas, but preferably it comprises a nobel gas such as argon.<br>

The feed comprises of H2 and CO and it may be mixed with other gases such as COa, N2 and CH4 in the conventional manner.<br>
The invention will now be further described by means of the following non limiting examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
1.	Catalyst preparation<br>
A high surface area precipitated iron FT catalyst containing Fe, SiOa, Cu and K was used. Loadings of 25 g Si02l 5g Cu and 5g K20 /100 Fe were used.<br>
2.	Preparation of acid solution<br>
Glacial acetic acid was dissolved in n-octane to provide a 5 mass% acid/octane mixture. The mixture was kept under an argon blanket to keep oxygen out.<br><br>
3.       LIFT synthesis<br>
3.1      Analysis used:<br>
Acid numbers were determined with an acid base titration (KOH) using phenolphthalein as indicator. Analysis was limited to the water fraction as more than 90% by mass of the acid reports in the water phase.<br>
The acid group selectivity was expressed as the selectivity of acid groups (COOH) as function of total carbon from FTS.<br>
3.2     Synthesis<br>
Activation of the catalyst was done with synthesis gas (feed gas) (H2/CO (mol/mol) = 1.5) at 240°C and 2000 kPa for 16 hours at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 6400 Nml/g cat/h.<br>
FTS was carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor and two knock out pots (200°C for wax and 25°C for oil and water) were used. FTS was done using a H2/CO molar feed ratio of 1.5 at 2650 kPa and 245°C.<br><br>
The product selectivity was determined over a period of 150 hours. The synthesis gas conversion was kept at ~ 35 mass% by correcting the feed gas flow rate. The gas hour space velocity (GHSV) was changed to obtain a (CO + CO2) conversion of 35%. 10% Argon was co-fed as an inert tracer to determine conversion and contraction.<br>
After FTS performance was determined, the influence of co-feeding (introducing) an organic acid to the FTS reactor was studied. The glacial acetic acid dissolved in n-octane was co-fed (introduced) by means of a HPLC pump to the FT reactor at a rate of 2.1x10"3 mol/h acetic acid. The co-fed acetic acid was 0.065 mol% of the total feed to the reactor. This was about 3 times the production rate of acids as measured by acid determination in the water phase of the FT product. After 173 hours of normal FT synthesis, the co-feeding of the acetic acid/n-octane was commenced and was stopped at 246 hours where after normal FTS was continued.<br>
The results are provided below: Figure 1: The COa selectivity of the acetic acid<br><br>

Time on line (h)<br><br>
250<br><br>
300<br><br>
350<br><br>
C02 selectivity is expressed as mol CO2 produced/mol CO converted<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Remove) <br><br><br><br>
In Table 1, "Apparent acid group selectivity" is expressed as the total acid as analysed by acid base titration ((acid co-fed + acid produced)/CO to FT) .<br><br>
The "Acid production rate" is the total ackf analysed minus acfd co-fed. "Acid group selectivity" is the mol acfd produced per mol CO converted to FT products.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br><br><br>
it is clear from Tabfe 1 that the introduction of the acid in the LTFT process resulted in decreased CO2 and acid production.<br>
It was also found that double bond isomerisation was not influenced by the acid addition in the FT reactor.<br>
It is clear from trie above that CQ£ production can be manipulated by the introduction of acid in the LTFT process. When the acid is introduced the CO2 production drops, and the COS production increases again when the acid co-feeding is stopped. The co-feeding of acetic acid results in a decrease in<br><br>
H2/CO reactor ratio and therefore also results in decreased H2/CO usage ratio.<br>
The results have also shown that the introduced acid does not enhance de-activation of the iron-based catalyst.<br>
The introduced acid does not leach metal from the FT catalyst as no colour change of the produced wax was observed during and after acid co-feeding was commenced. ICP analysis of the wax also showed that the iron level in the wax was below 2ppm.<br>
Example 2<br>
1.	Catalyst preparation<br>
The same catalyst as mentioned in Example 1 was used. 2,       Preparation of acid solution<br>
Glacial acetic acid was dissolved in n-octane to render a 7.23 mass% acetic acid in octane. The mixture was kept under an argon blanket to keep oxygen out.<br><br>
3.       LIFT synthesis<br>
Activation of the catalyst and FTS were carried out in the same manner as described in Example 1.<br>
After FTS performance was determined, the influence of co-feeding (introducing) an organic acid at different acid concentrations to the FTS reactor was studied. The glacial acetic acid dissolved in n-octane was co-fed (introduced) after 125 hours time on line by means of a HPLC pump to the FT reactor, at a rate of 2.1x10"3 mol/h acetic acid. The co-fed acetic acid was 0.062 mol% of the total feed to the reactor, whereafter the concentration was increased subsequently to 0.12 mol% acid per total mol feed after 199 hours and 0.25 mol% acid per total mol feed after 230 hours. Co-feeding (introducing) of the acetic acid/n-octane mixture was stopped after 269 hours time on line and normal FTS was continued.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2.<br>
Example 3 1.       Catalyst preparation<br>
The same catalyst as mentioned in Example 1 was used.<br><br>
2.	Preparation of acid solution<br>
Octanoic acid was dissolved in n-octane to provide a 6.16 mass% octanoic acid in octane mixture. The mixture was kept under an argon blanket to keep oxygen out.<br>
3.	LIFT synthesis<br>
Activation of the catalyst and FTS were carried out in the same manner as described in Example 1.<br>
After FTS performance was determined for 211 hours, the octanoic acid dissolved in n-octane was co-fed (introduced) by means of a HPLC pump to the FT reactor at a rate of 2.1x10"3 mol/h octanoic acid. The co-fed (introduced) octanoic acid was approximately 0.065 mol% of the total feed to the reactor. Co-feeding (introduction) of the octanoic acid/n-octane mixture was stopped after 260 hours time on line and normal FTS was continued.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
1.	Catalyst preparation<br>
The same catalyst as mentioned in Example 1 was used.<br>
2.	Preparation of acid solution<br>
Malonic acid was dissolved in acetone to give a 5 mass% acid in acetone mixture. The mixture was kept under an argon blanket to keep oxygen out.<br>
3.	LTFT synthesis<br>
Activation of the catalyst and FTS were carried out in the same manner as described in Example 1.<br>
The effect of co-feeding (introducing) an organic di-acid to the FT reactor was investigated. After FTS performance was determined, the malonic acid/acetone mixture was co-fed (introduced) to FT reactor after 130 hours time on line by means of a HPLC pump at a rate of 2.1x10"3 mol/h malonic acid.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
Figure 2: Change in COa selectivity by varying the acid concentration of various acids in feed during FTS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The effect of co-feeding (introducing) various mono- and di-carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, octanoic acid and malonic acid, as well as different acetic acid concentrations, on FTS was investigated. Figure 2 illustrates the change in CO2 selectivity at different acid concentrations for the various acids. An increase in acid concentration renders an accelerated decrease in COa selectivity where after a maximum decrease in COs selectivity is obtained at a certain acid concentration, approximate 0.22 mol% acid per mol total feed for this specific catalyst. Similar behavior on the change in CO2 selectivity is observed for the different mono-carboxylic acids while the effect was less prominent for the di-acid. A possible reason for latter is that malonic acid easily undergoes decarboxylation above 140°C to form acetic acid. Therefore the reduction in COa selectivity will be less using malonic acid.<br><br><br><br>
