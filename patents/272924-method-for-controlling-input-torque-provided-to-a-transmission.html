CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/984,928 filed on 11/02/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure is related to hybrid vehicle torque control systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
 <br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A method for controlling an input torque provided to a transmission<br>
includes executing a first iterative search within a first range of permissible<br>
torque values to determine a first torque value based on a first cost value. The<br>
first cost value is based on a first set of powertrain measurements measured at<br>
a first time. A second cost value based on a second torque value and the first<br>
set of powertrain measurements measured at the first time is calculated. The<br>
second torque value is determined using a second set of powertrain<br>
measurements measured at a second time prior to the first time. One of the<br>
first torque value and the second torque value is then selected based on the<br>
first cost value and the second cost value.<br>
 <br>

[0007] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0001] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIG. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
 <br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as TI,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0002] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed, NI, and the input torque, TI, to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0003] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
 <br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0004] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0005] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
 <br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively.<br>
[0006] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, NO and an output torque, TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0007] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a<br>
result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The<br>
transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
 <br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in<br>
response to torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 to achieve the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0008] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to achieve the input torques TA and TB. The power<br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not<br>
shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a<br>
switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is<br>
typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of<br>
the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation<br>
or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive<br>
or supply DC electric power via respective ones of the transfer conductors 29<br>
and 31 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted<br>
 <br>
to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as<br>
motors or generators.<br>
[0009] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
the exemplary powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control module<br>
system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms<br>
to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
 <br>
[0010] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as<br>
antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0011] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving<br>
to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
 <br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0012] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, T|, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0013] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
 <br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0014] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0015] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and<br>
BPCM 21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
 <br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the<br>
occurrence of an event.<br>
[0016] The exemplary powertrain selectively operates in one of several<br>
operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine on state ('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0017] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode I, or MI, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode II, or<br>
MII, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('MII_Eng_On') or OFF ('MIIEngOff). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
 <br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation<br>
('FG1') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed<br>
gear operation ('FG2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A<br>
third fixed gear operation ('FG3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('FG4') is selected by applying clutches<br>
C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases<br>
with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the<br>
planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal<br>
rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to<br>
the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0018] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine the commanded output torque,<br>
TCMD, intended to meet the operator torque request, TO_REQ, to be executed at<br>
the output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator<br>
pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described.<br>
The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand<br>
caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
 <br>
72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines preferred system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0019] The HCP 5 manages input torque from the engine 14 and the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 using a result of a method for<br>
controlling input torque described below, and system efficiencies are<br>
optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery charging. The HCP 5<br>
monitors the torque-generative devices, and determines the power output from<br>
the transmission 10 required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the<br>
operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description above,<br>
the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transmit power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br>
[0020] Referring to FIG. 3, a method 300 for controlling the input torque<br>
TI provided to the transmission 10 is now described. As used herein, search<br>
loops will be associated with times "N", "N+1" and "N-1". Search loop N<br>
refers to a search loop executed by the HCP 5 at time N. Search loop N-1<br>
refers to a search loop executed immediately prior to the search loop N.<br>
Search loop N+1 refers to a search loop executed immediately after the search<br>
 <br>
loop N. Each search loop includes a number of iterations designated by "n".<br>
Further, "j" refers to a specific iteration within a search loop and ranges in<br>
value from 1 to n.<br>
[0021] The method determines a "preferred torque value". The term<br>
"preferred torque value" as used herein for the search run N designates a<br>
torque value with a lowest cost associated therewith among torque value<br>
candidates of the search loop N or a preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT<br>
determined during the search loop N-1.<br>
[0022] For search loop N-1, the HCP 5 sets a torque value associated with<br>
a minimum cost to the preferred input value T(N-1) OPT (320), and the HCP 5<br>
controls engine torque based on the preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT (322).<br>
The process used by the HCP 5 in setting a torque value candidate associated<br>
with minimum cost to the preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT (320) and in<br>
controlling input torque based on T(N-1)OPT (322) is described in further detail<br>
in reference to steps 316 and 318 for the search loop N below.<br>
[0023] Further, when T(N-1) OPT is determined, T(N-1) OPT is sent to a buffer<br>
of the HCP storage medium (not shown). The buffer stores the preferred<br>
torque value T(N-1) OPT for utilization in the search loop N.<br>
[0024] Steps 302, 304, 310, 312, 314, 316, 318 and 324 are steps of the<br>
search loop N.<br>
[0025] The HCP 5 determines a permissible torque range (302) TN_MIN to<br>
TN_MAX. The minimum and maximum permissible torque values TN_MIN and<br>
TN_MAX are based on current operating conditions of the engine 14 and on<br>
ambient conditions. For example, engine speed can be measured and utilized<br>
 <br>
to determine the minimum and maximum permissible torque values TN_MIN and<br>
TN_MAX.<br>
[0026] The minimum and maximum permissible torque values TN_MIN and<br>
TN_MAX comprise practical constraints associated with the specific engine<br>
configuration, and are based upon operating characteristics of the specific<br>
engine used, with the limits related to, for example, maximum torque output<br>
and combustion stability.<br>
[0027] The HCP 5 performs an iterative search within the permissible<br>
torque range TN_MIN to TN_MAX, to find a search result torque value TN_SEARCH<br>
(304). The iterative search utilizes a search engine (not shown). The search<br>
engine determines torque value candidates using a golden section search. The<br>
golden section search engine divides the permissible torque range from TN_MIN<br>
to TN_MAX into golden sections where the smaller golden section to larger<br>
golden section ratio is φ or (-(1 + √5/2) to determine a first torque candidate<br>
values (TNj), where j=l and a second torque candidate values (TNj), where j=2.<br>
[0028] The first and second torque value candidates T Nj are inputted in<br>
evaluation of cost (324). A cost determination function f(TNj, yN) determines a<br>
cost PNj associated with the torque value candidates TNj and with an input<br>
value yN based on a set of powertrain measurements. In particular, the input<br>
value YN is based on the set of powertrain measurements measured at the time<br>
of the search run N. Thus, the cost PNj is determined as a function f(TNj, yN).<br>
[0029] The cost PNj is indicative of a total powertrain system loss. In one<br>
embodiment, the cost determination function generally determines costs based<br>
on value yN, which is based on a set of powertrain measurements related to<br>
 <br>
fuel economy, emissions, and battery life. Furthermore, lower operating costs<br>
are generally associated with lower battery power usage, and lower emissions<br>
for an operating point, and take into account a current operating range state of<br>
the powertrain system. In one embodiment, the total powertrain system loss<br>
includes an overall system power loss and a cost penalty, such as can be<br>
associated with controlling battery state of charge. The total powertrain<br>
system loss comprises a term based upon losses in the electrical system (e.g.<br>
wire impedances and switching and solenoid losses), and heat losses. Other<br>
losses include electrical machine power losses and internal battery power<br>
losses. In other embodiments, other powertrain measurements may also be<br>
considered in determining operating cost, including powertrain measurements<br>
related to battery life due to depth of discharge of the ESD 74, and the effect<br>
on state of charge of the battery. Operating costs are developed relative to<br>
specific powertrain/vehicle applications.<br>
[0030] The evaluation of cost (324) is separated from the iterative search<br>
(304) such that the search engine selects torque value candidates based on<br>
outputs from the evaluation of cost 324. A result of the function f(TNj, yN) is<br>
sent back to the iterative search 304 and the search engine uses the result to<br>
further divide golden sections into golden subsections to determine a new<br>
torque candidate value TNj where j=3.<br>
[0031] The iterative search 304 and the evaluation of cost 304 continue to<br>
iteratively determine torque value candidates TNj until a selected number of<br>
iterations are performed. In particular, the search engine searches for 9<br>
iterations. The search result torque value TN_SEARCH is associated with the<br>
 <br>
lowest cost determined during the iterative search. The tolerance level<br>
associated with a torque value candidate at the ninth iteration step is preferably<br>
less than +/- 6 Newton-meters.<br>
[0032] In alternative embodiments, the search engine performs other<br>
numbers of iterations. For example, in one alternative embodiment, the search<br>
engine performs fifteen iterations. Further, in other alternative embodiments,<br>
the search engine performs iterations for an elapsed period of time or until a<br>
selected search tolerance level is reached.<br>
[0033] In alternative exemplary embodiments, other search functions can<br>
be utilized. For example, other one-dimensional search functions such as<br>
Fibonacci search functions and like search functions can be utilized.<br>
[0034] The cost associated with search result torque value TN_SEARCH from<br>
the evaluation of cost f(TN_SEARCH, YN) is utilized in step 314 where it is<br>
compared with the cost of the preferred torque of the previous search run N-1<br>
evaluated at current powertrain measurements as described in further detail<br>
below.<br>
[0035] The HCP 5 determines whether the preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT<br>
from the previous search run is within the range of permissible values based<br>
on engine conditions at time N (310). In particular, the HCP 5 determines<br>
whether the preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT is within the permissible torque<br>
range from TN_MIN to TN_MAX.<br>
[0036] If T(N-1)OPT is within the permissible torque range of TN_MIN to<br>
TN_MAX, the HCP 5 then proceeds to step 312. If T(N-1) OPT, is not within the<br>
range of TN_MIN to TN_MAX, then the HCP 5 proceeds to step 316.<br>
 <br>
[0037] A cost function of 326 is utilized to calculate a cost PN based on the<br>
preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT and the input value based on the set of<br>
powertrain measurements yN (312). The input value based on the set of<br>
powertrain measurements yN is based on the set of powertrain measurements<br>
measured at time N. Thus, the cost is calculated utilizing f(T(N-1) OPT, yN).<br>
[0038] The HCP 5 compares torque costs calculated by f(TN_SEARCH, YN)<br>
and f(T(N-1)OPT, YN) to determine which of the search result torque value<br>
TN_SEARCH or previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT, has the lowest<br>
cost associated therewith (314).<br>
[0039] The preferred torque value TOPT is set to either the search result<br>
torque value TN_SEARCH or previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT<br>
(316). In particular, if the previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT is not<br>
in the permissible torque range of TN_MIN to TN_MAX (step 310), then the<br>
preferred torque value TOPT is set to the search result torque value TN_SEARCH<br>
If the previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1)OPT, is in the permissible<br>
torque range of TN_MIN to TN_MAX , then the preferred torque value TOPT is set to<br>
either the search result torque value TN_SEARCH or the previous loop preferred<br>
torque value T(N-1) OPT based on the torque value having the lowest cost<br>
associated therewith as determined in step 314.<br>
[0040] The method 300 is graphically depicted in FIG. 4. In particular,<br>
FIG. 4 shows graph 500 and graph 510. Graph 500 illustrates the iterative<br>
search of search loop N-1 wherein the torque values are depicted on the x-axis<br>
and the cost values are depicted on the y-axis. Graph 510 illustrates the<br>
 <br>
iterative search of search loop N-1 where the torque values are depicted on the<br>
x-axis and the cost values at time N-1 are depicted on the y-axis.<br>
[0041] Graph 500 includes torque value candidates 502 and preferred<br>
torque value T(N-1) OPT 504. Graph 510 shows torque value candidates 512 and<br>
search result torque value TN_SEARCH 514. Further, graph 510 shows preferred<br>
torque value T(N-1) OPT 504 with respect to the evaluated cost at time N. Thus,<br>
graph 510 illustrates the cost comparison step 314 of the method 300 where<br>
the torque value associated with the lowest cost function at time N of<br>
TN_SEARCH or T(N-1) OPT is determined based on the lowest cost value.<br>
[0042] Referring again to FIG. 3, the HCP 5 controls the input torque<br>
(318). In particular, the HCP 5 sets the input torque T1 to the preferred torque<br>
value TN OPT, and the HCP 5 inputs the input torque T1 to a system equation<br>
function, from which state values for first electric machine 56 motor torque TA<br>
and second electric machine 72 motor torque TB are determined. The torque<br>
relationship between the first electric machine 56 motor torque TA and the<br>
second electric machine motor torque 72 TB is as defined in Eqs 1 and 2,<br>
below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein the input torque T, is originating from engine 14, The transmission<br>
output torque TO is output at the shaft 64, i.e., the requested output torque,<br>
TO_REQ, TAand TB are the operating torques for the first electric machine 56 and<br>
the second electric machine 72, N 1 represents time-rate change in<br>
transmission input speed Nl, and d11, d12, d13, d14, and g11, g12, g13, g14 are<br>
known scalar values determined for each of the fixed gears of the specific<br>
application.<br>
[0043] The HCP 5 utilizing the method 300 determines the value for input<br>
torque TI rapidly due to the separation of the iterative search 304 and the<br>
evaluation of cost 324. In particular, the iterative search 304 quickly<br>
determines torque value candidates and provides each candidate to the<br>
evaluation of cost 324 such that the evaluation of cost only has to solve for<br>
one unknown variable per iterative step. The HCP 5 utilizing the method 300<br>
determines the value for input torque TI in less than 25 milliseconds.<br>
[0044] By comparing the cost for the previous loop preferred torque value<br>
T(N-I)OPT to the search result torque value TN_SEARCH when determining the<br>
preferred torque value TOPT, the method 300, provides stability in maintaining<br>
the previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT when desirable thereby<br>
decreasing variation in the preferred torque value TOPT. Further, by comparing<br>
the cost for the previous loop preferred torque value T(N-1) OPT to the search<br>
result torque value TN_SEARCH, the method 300 can reduce the probability of<br>
search failures associated with local minima within the permissible torque<br>
range of TN_MIN to TN_MAX.<br>
 <br>
