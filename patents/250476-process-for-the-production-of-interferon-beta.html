TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH LEVELS OF<br>
INTERFERON BETA-IB"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD., a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed:<br><br>
ZRC-BT-004<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the production of interferon-beta in improved yields by fermentation. Background of the Invention:<br>
Three major types of interferons have been identified in humans: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferons. These are produced by a variety of cells upon exposure to viruses, mitogens, polynucleotides etc. They possess anti-viral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties. IFN-P is used as an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis [Corboy JR. et al., Current Treatment Options in Neurology, 5, 35-54 (2003)], hepatitis B and hepatitis C.<br>
Betaseron, an analogue of human IFN-P where serine was genetically engineered to substitute for cysteine at position 17, is known as IFN-P lb (US 4588585). The molecule is a small polypeptide of 165 amino acids with a single disulphide bond, and is produced as a non-glycosylated protein. The glycosylated variant of IFN-P, known as IFN-p la, has a carbohydrate chain at position 80 and is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells [Conradt et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262, 14600-5 (1987); Kagawa et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263, 17508-15 (1988); Oh et. al., Biotechnol. Prog., 21, 1154-64 (2005); US 5795779 (McCormik et al); US 5554513 (Revel et al)].<br>
IFN-P was initially produced by inducing the leukocytes by treating them with viruses. But the therapeutic use of interferon-P produced in this manner is questionable because of the high chances of the presence of various contaminants (e.g. viruses) in such preparations. Recombinant technology has made it possible to produce IFN-P, which is free from viral contamination. Native IFN-P is a glycoprotein, and its production has been reported in mammalian, insect and yeast cells, as described in Mantei et al., Nature 297: 128 (1982); Ohno et al., Nucl Acid. Res. 10: 967 (1982); and Smith et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3: 2156 (1983), respectively.<br>
US 5795779 (McCormick et al.) discloses high level production of IFN-P from recombinant CHO cells. US 5554513 (Revel et al.) discloses two subtypes of IFN-P and describes methods to produce it in CHO cells. But all commercial animal cell culture processes are associated with technical difficulties like longer process time, requirement for maintaining stringent culturing conditions, high cost of culture media etc.<br>
Also, the glycosylation was shown to play no role in the biological activity of the protein [Taniguchi, et al., Gene 10, 11-15 (1980); E. Knight Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. , 73, 520 (1976); E. Knight Jr. and D. Fahey, J. Interferon Res. 2(3), 421 (1982)] thereby underscoring the advantage of carrying out the production in the commonly used host, E. coli. Various<br>
2<br><br>
ZRC-BT-004<br>
recombinant proteins have been produced in E. coli by this technology [Saraswat et al. FEMS Microbiology Lett., 179, 367-73 (1999); Holowachuk &amp; Ruhoff, Protein Expr. Purif. 6, 588-96 (1995); Kim et. al, Biotechnol. &amp; Bioeng., 69, (2000); Kim et al., Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering, 24 (2001); Saraswat et. al. Biotechnol. Lett., 22, 261-5 (2000); Lee et. al, FEMS Microbiology Lett., 195, 127-132 (2001); Saraswat et. al. Biochemistry, 41, 15566-77 (2002); Wang et al., Chin. J. Biotechnol. 11, 45-81 (1995)].<br>
IFN-P has been cloned and expressed in E. coli (Taniguchi, et al., Gene 10, 11-15 (1980).<br>
EP 0048970 (Goeddel et al.) describes microbial production of mature human fibroblast interferon.<br>
Like for any therapeutic protein, it is desirable to obtain high levels of interferon-P for commercial purposes. EP 0036776 (Kield et al.) discloses novel vectors based on tryptophan promoter-operator system for the efficient production of heterologous protein in bacteria. US 4686191 (Itoh et al.) discloses methods to obtain efficient expression of interferon-P in E. coli, by using improved vectors with trp promoter, to increase the efficiency of protein synthesis. US 4499188 (Konrad et al.) claims to solve the problem of monitoring repressor levels during culturing, when trp promoter is used for interferon-P production. Mizukami et al. in US 4746608 suggest the method of culturing the recombinant microorganism at a temperature 10 to 25 °C lower than the optimum growth temperature, for obtaining a high yield of interferon-P. Ben-Bassat et al. in US 4656132 claim to solve the problem of lower yields of interferon-P by addition of an effective amount of a water-soluble alkanol of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and/or a mixture of amino acids that supports bacterial growth during the late phase of the cultivation. Cousens et al. in US 5866362 have suggested the production of interferon-P as protein aggregates by growing the host cells in a medium comprising an effective amount of Cu++ so that they form inclusion bodies in the host cell from which the protein is isolated and purified. But none of the processes could achieve satisfactory levels of interferon-p. Because of the hydrophobic nature of interferon-p, the synthesized protein interferes with cell growth and thus the production of interferon-P is not achieved at significantly high levels.<br>
Dorin et al. in US 5814485 disclose certain conditions that increase the expression of hydrophobic polypeptide like interferon-P in transformed host cells. The critical conditions for the invention (US 5814485) are Potassium ion concentration no greater than 120mM and/or Sodium ion concentration no greater than 40mM and/or pH between 4.8 and 6.8 during the induction of protein production.<br>
The present invention discloses similar to higher level of production of interferon-P as that disclosed in US 5814485 by inducing the protein production at conditions, which are not<br>

ZRC-BT-004<br>
dependent on maintaining low levels of Potassium and Sodium ion concentrations in the production media. This is achieved by careful selection of the nitrogen source and other nutrients/additives before or during the production phase. Summary of Invention:<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method to produce recombinant interferon-P in high levels using selective culture conditions.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides high levels of interferon-P even under levels of K+, and Na+ ion concentration that are higher than that dictated in the prior art, by careful selection of nitrogen source and other nutrients in the production and/or pre-production medium.<br>
In one of its aspects the present invention provides high levels of interferon-P even under higher pH than that dictated in the prior art for obtaining high yield of interferon beta.<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention obtains significantly high levels of IFN-P using a process of fermentation in which culturing conditions are more cost effective than prior art processes. Brief description of drawings:<br>

FIGURE 5 shows the amino acid sequence of IFN-p (Seq ID 1) Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel fermentation process for the production of interferon-|3 at high levels of expression. Various culturing conditions for the high level production of interferon-P protein using transformed Escherichia coli have been studied leading to an alternate, highly efficient process for its production. The present invention discloses culturing conditions for improved product yields. The present invention is described in detail below:<br>
Any interferon-P (also referred here as 'IFN-p') polypeptide can be utilized. The term "interferon-P" or "IFN-P" refers to native IFN-P, muteins, fragments, fusions, analogs and derivatives thereof, either exhibiting at least 60% biological or receptor binding activity as the native IFN-P, or retaining at least about 80% amino acid identity with SEQ ID No. 1 (amino acid sequence of human IFN-p).<br>
The IFN- p gene used in the present invention is the mutated form of the native gene where the 17* amico acid, serine, was genetically engineered to substitute for cysteine according to US 4588585. This mutated analogue of human IFN-P is known as IFN-P lb. The source of the native IFN beta gene used in the present invention is human lung fibroblast cell line, MRC 5, from NCCS, Pune, INDIA. The above described mutation was introduced into this gene using standard molecular biology techniques reported in the prior art.<br>
Suitable host cells, preferably Escherichia coli are transformed with a suitable expression vector comprising the coding sequence of IFN-P and a suitable promotor selected from t7, tac, and similar promoters along with other vector components using transformation techniques well known in art. The Escherichia strain for the present invention is selected from the group comprising Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and its derivatives. Preferably the host is Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) which is deposited at ATCC deposit no ATCC 47092. The source of the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) used in the present invention is Stratagene, USA.<br>
The transformed host cells were initially cultured under conditions for growth in batch mode of fermentation. The culture media used in the process of the present invention comprise carbon and energy sources selected from the group comprising of glucose, glycerol, fructose, maltose, galactose and the like or mixtures thereof, nitrogen source selected from the group comprising of yeast extract, tryptone, peptone, casein enzyme hydrolysate, soyabean casein hydrolysate, gelatin, and the like or mixtures thereof, suitable salts/nutrients selected from the<br>

ZRC-BT-004<br>
group consisting of citric acid, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium sulphate, di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium butyrate, thiamine, glycine, and zinc chloride. The pH is maintained at about 5-8. The temperature is maintained at about 30-40 °C. Other fermentation conditions like aeration and agitation, inoculum, time of inoculation etc. chosen as per convenience of a person skilled in the art.<br>
Substrate limiting fed-batch mode of fermentation is initiated once the substrate concentration in the culture media is maintained at about 0.5 g/L or less. After achieving a cell density of 1-30 g/L dry cell weight and a glucose concentration less than 0.5 g/L, addition of the pre-production medium was done. The pre-production medium comprise, a nitrogen source selected from the group comprising complex nitrogen sources like tryptone, casein enzyme hydrolysate (CEH), soyabean casein hydrolysate, gelatin digest, and the like, their combinations with each other and their combinations with yeast extract, suitable salts/nutrients selected from the group comprising of citric acid, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium sulphate, di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium butyrate, thiamine, glycine, and zinc chloride, suitable antibiotics like Ampicillin, Kanamycin etc., which are selected as required by the process. The pH is maintained at about 6.3-8, preferably at pH 6.5-7.0, and the temperature is maintained at about 25-40 °C, preferably at about 37 °C. The total K+ concentration of the culture media is greater than 120mM and the Na+ concentration is greater than 40mM, preferably in the range of 60-80 mM. Carbon source may not be added to the pre-production medium. Induction of protein production is done after the addition of the pre-production medium. A suitable inducer can be added in a single lot, multiple lots or in a continuous manner. A continuous feed of production medium (in fed-batch mode) is started immediately after adding the inducer. The production medium comprises a carbon source in addition to the constituents of the pre-production medium. Suitable carbon source can be selected from the group comprising of glycerol, glucose, fructose, maltose, galactose and the like or mixtures thereof. The preferred carbon source of the present invention is glucose. The pH of the medium is maintained at about 6.3-8, preferably at pH 6.5-7.0, and the temperature is maintained at about 25-40 °C, preferably at about 37 °C. All other conditions of fermentation are selected as known in the prior art. Throughout the production phase of fermentation the total K+ concentration of the culture media is greater than 120 mM and the Na+ concentration is greater than 40 mM. After 5 to 24 hours, the culture medium is removed and subjected to downstream processing according to the techniques described in art. The process of the present invention results in the production of the hydrophobic proteins like IFN-P in high yields (expression level in the range of 4-28% of the total cellular protein) as estimated densitometrically using protein bands obtained with SDS-PAGE method.<br>
