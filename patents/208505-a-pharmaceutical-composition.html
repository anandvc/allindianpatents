"A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
1 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF CHOLESTERYL      ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 	This invention relates to cholesteryl ester<br>
transfer protein(CETP) inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing such inhibitors and the use of such inhibitors to elevate certain plasma lipid levels, including high density lipoprotein     (HDL)-cholesterol and to lower certain other plasma lipid levels, such as low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides and accordingly to treat diseases which are affected by low levels of HDL cholesterol and/or high levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, such as     atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases in certain mammals (i.e., those which have CETP in their plasma), including humans.<br>
CETP inhibitors, particularly those that have<br>
high binding activity, are generally hydrophobic, have<br>
    extremely low aqueous solubility and have low oral<br>
bioavailability when dosed conventionally.  Such<br>
compounds have generally proven to be difficult to<br>
  formulate for oral administration such that high<br>
bioavailabilities are achieved.<br>
25	Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary<br>
artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world.  Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dyslipidemia with dietary     modification and drug therapy, coronary heart disease<br>
(CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S.,<br>
where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all<br>
deaths, with 53% of these associated with" atherosclerotic<br>
coronary heart disease.<br>
 	Risk for development of this condition has been<br>
shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels.  While elevated LDL-cholesterol may be the most<br><br>
recognized form of dyslipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low HDL-cholesterol is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, D.J., et al., : "High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease", Circulation, (1989) , 29: 8-15) .<br>
High LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases.  Thus, dyslipidemia is not a unitary, risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more lipid aberrations.<br>
Among the many factors controlling plasma levels of these disease dependent principles, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects all three. The role of this 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein found in a number of animal species, including humans, is to transfer cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between lipoprotein particles, including high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol.  This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be pro-atherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for CHD.<br>
No wholly satisfactory HDL-elevating therapies exist.  Niacin can significantly increase HDL, but has serious toleration issues which reduce compliance. Fibrates and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors raise HDL-cholesterol only modestly (-10-12%).  As a result, there is a significant unmet medical need for a well-tolerated agent which can significantly elevate plasma HDL levels, thereby reversing or slowing the progression of  atherosclerosis.<br>
CETP inhibitors have been developed which inhibit CETP activity, and thus, if present in the blood,<br><br>
should result in higher HDL cholesterol levels and lower LDL cholesterol levels.  To be effective, such CETP inhibitors must be absorbed into the blood.  Oral dosing of CETP inhibitors is preferred because to be effective such CETP inhibitors must be taken on a regular basis, such as daily.  Therefore, it is preferred that patients be able to take CETP inhibitors by oral dosing rather than by injection.<br>
However, it has proven to be difficult to formulate CETP inhibitors for oral administration such that therapeutic blood levels are achieved.  CETP inhibitors in general possess a number of characteristics which render them poorly bioavailable when dosed orally in a conventional manner.  CETP inhibitors tend to be quite hydrophobic and extremely water insoluble, with solubility in aqueous solution of usually less than about 10 fig/ml  and typically less than 1 fig/ml.     Often, the aqueous solubility of CETP inhibitors is less than 0.1 μg/ml.     Indeed, the solubility of some CETP inhibitors is so low that it is in fact difficult to measure.  Accordingly, when CETP inhibitors are dosed orally, concentrations of CETP inhibitor in the aqueous environment of the gastrointestinal tract tend to be extremely low, resulting in poor absorption from the GI tract to blood.  The hydrophobicity of CETP inhibitors not only leads to low equilibrium aqueous solubility but also tends to make the drugs poorly wetting and slow to dissolve, further reducing their tendency to dissolve and be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  This combination of characteristics has resulted in the bioavailability for orally dosed conventional crystalline or amorphous forms of CETP inhibitors generally to be quite low, often having absolute bioavailabilities of less than 1%.<br>
Various attempts have been made to improve the aqueous concentration of CETP inhibitors, but generally have met with limited success.  At the outset, most<br><br>
methods aimed at enhancing aqueous concentration and bioavailability of low-solubility drugs only offer moderate improvements.  Such improvements generally lead to enhancements in aqueous concentration on the order of from one to seven fold.  In addition, the enhancement may be short-lived, with the drug concentration returning to the equilibrium concentration within 10 to 40 minutes. Such small, short-l;.ved concentration enhancements have led to even lower levels of bioavailability enhancement when tested in  vivo via oral administration.  Thus, when conventional dosage forms of low-solubility drugs are tested in   vivo  via oral administration, bioavailability<br>
enhancements are typically on the order of 2-fold to 4-fold or less.  For CETP inhibitors .having low absolute bioavailabilities, such small improvements are insufficient to allow convenient oral dosing of CETP inihibitors; that is, dosage forms having a convenient size and frequency of dosing.<br>
Moreover, some standard methods for improving the concentration of pharmaceuticals in aqueous solution have proven inadequate when applied to CETP inhibitors. For example, even pre-dissolving the CETP inhibitor in a water miscible solvent such as polyethylene glycol followed by delivery as a solution to an aqueous environment of use has failed to raise the aqueous concentration of CETP inhibitor to an acceptable level.<br>
Sikorski, et al. , WO 99/14204, and Lee, et al., WO 99/41237, both disclose CETP inhibitors formulated for oral administration .using hydroxy propyl methyl celluose in a controlled release dosage form which is characterized as a "dispersion. Both Sikorski and Lee appear to be using the term "dispersion" to mean a controlled release matrix in which drug particles are distributed within a polymer matrix that slowly erodes rather than a solid amorphous dispersion of the type of the present invention.  Such controlled release matrix compositions would slow rather than enhance the<br><br>
dissolution and absorption of CETP inhibitor.  In any event, both Sikorski and Lee state that CETP inhibitors may be orally dosed by simply dissolving the CETP inhibitor in water without any discussion of the difficulty of dissolving the CETP inhibitors in water. There is  no  recognition in either Sikorski or Lee of the need to improve the aqueous concentration or bioavailability of CETP inhibitors.<br>
Curatolo et al., EP 0 901 786 A2 disclose solid pharmaceutical dispersions with enhanced bioavailability using spray dried dispersions of a sparingly soluble drug and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate. However, Curatolo et: al. do not disclose the use of CETP inhibitors, or discuss the problems associated with the formulation of CETP inhibitors for oral administration.<br>
Nakamichi et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,456,923 disclose a process for producing solid dispersions of sparingly soluble drugs and a variety of polymeric materials, such as hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate.  However, Nakamichi et al. does not disclose dispersions containing CETP inhibitors, much less discuss the problems associated with formulating hydrophobic drugs.<br>
Accordingly, there is still a need for developing compositions of CETP inhibitors that may be orally dosed, that improve the aqueous concentration of such drugs, that improve the bioavailablity of such drugs relative to compositions of the drugs alone, and that does not adversely affect the ability of the drugs to act therapeutically.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
  The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art by providing in a first aspect a pharmaceutical composition comprising a solid amorphous dispersion of CETP inhibitor and a concentration-enhancing polymer.<br><br>
In a second aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a solid amorphous dispersion of CETP inhibitor and a concentration-enhancing polymer, the CETP inhibitor having a solubility of less than about 10 μg/ml   in aqueous solution at any pH of from 1 to 8 in the absence of the concentration-enhancing polymer.<br>
In' a third aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a solid amorphous dispersion of a CETP inhibitor and a concentration-enhancing polymer, the composition providing a maximum concentration of the CETP inhibitor in a use environment that is at least about 10-fold the maximum concentration provided by  a control composition comprising an equivalent amount of the CETP inhibitor and free from the polymer.  As used herein, a "use environment" can be either the in  vivo  environment of the GI tract of a<br>
mammal, particularly a human, or the in  vitro  environment<br>
of a test solution, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Model Fasted Duodenal (MFD) solution.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a solid amorphous dispersion of a CET? inhibitor and a concentration-enhancing polymer, the composition providing a relative oral bioavailability that is at least about 4 relative to a control composition comprising an equivalent amount of the CETP inhibitor and free from the polymer.<br>
In a fifth aspect of the invention, a method is provided for treating atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic: restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity or endotoxemia in a mammal (including a human being, either male or female)<br><br>
by administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a composition of the present invention comprised of a CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer.<br>
The composition may be dosed in a variety of dosage forms, including both immediate release and controlled release dosage forms, the latter including both. delayed and slstained release forms. the composition may include blends of polymers, and may further include other polymers that improve the aqueous concentration of the CETP inhibitor.<br>
The various aspects of the present invention each provide one or more of the following advantages. The compositions of the present invention improve the aqueous concentration of CETP inhibitors relative to compositions that are free from concentration-enhancing polymer, by providing aqueous concentration of CETP inhibitors of at least about 10-fold that of control compositions that are free from the concentration-enhancing polymer.  Such solubility enhancements are unexpectedly large relative to that typically observed for dispersions of other types of drugs.  Accordingly, the compositions of the present invention comprising a CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer allow the dose of CETP inhibitor required to obtain adequate efficacy to be reduced.<br>
In fact, compositions of the present invention often exhibit surprisingly large enhancements for some CETP inhibitors, on the order of 5 0 to 50 0-fold and in some cases up to a SO,000-fold improvement in concentra¬tion relative to that of a control crystalline composi¬tion.  Such large enhancements are, for some CETP inhibitors, necesssary for convenient oral administration. Trie compositicms thus render hydrophobic, substantially insoluble CETP inhibitors therapeutically effective with a convenient dose (mass of drug) for oral administration'. The foregcing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be more readily<br><br>
understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions of CETP inhibitors and at least one concentration-enhancing polymer.  As discussed above in the Background, CETP inhibitors generally have (1) extremely low solubilities in aqueous solution (i.e., less than about 10 μg/mL) at<br>
physiologically relevant pH (e.g.,   any pH of from 1<br>
through 8) measured at about 22°C; (2) a relatively hydrophobic nature; and (3) a relatively low bioavailability when orally dosed in the crystalline state.  Accordingly, CETP inhibitors require some kind of modification or formulation to enhance their solubility and thereby achieve good bioavailability.  Surprisingly, the compositions of the present invention provide unusually large enhancements in aqueous concentration in an environment of use and unusually large enhancements in bioavailability compared with other conventional compositions used to formulate poorly soluble, hydrophobic drugs.  The inventors have found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the compositions provide the greatest enhancements for those drugs which have been thought most difficult to formulate for oral delivery. Specifically, the inventors have found that preparing CETP inhibitors as compositions comprising a solid amorphous dispersion of a CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer, and preferably as a homogenous dispersion, improves the aqueous concentration of the CETP inhibitors as well as relative bioavailability.  The compositions, CETP inhibitors, suitable polymers, and optional excipients are discussed in more detail as follows.<br><br>
COMPOSITIONS OF CETP INHIBITORS AND CONCENTRATION-<br>
ENHANCING POLYMER The present invention finds utility with any low-solubility CETP inhibitor, or any CETP inhibitor which would benefit by improved bioavailability or more rapid absorption.  The compositions of the present invention comprise .dispersions of a CETP inhibitor and at least one concentration-enhancing polymer.  The CETP inhibitor in its pure state may be crystalline or amorphous.  Preferably, at least a major portion of the CETP inhibitor in the composition is amorphous.  By "amorphous" is meant simply that the CETP inhibitor is in a non-crystalline state.  As used herein, the term "a major portion" of the CETP inhibitor means that at least 60% of the CETP inhibitor in the composition is in the amorphous form, rather than the crystalline form. Preferably, the CETP inhibitor in the dispersion is substantially amorphous.  As used herein, "substantially amorphous" means that the amount of the CETP inhibitor in crystalline form does not exceed about 25%.  More preferably, the CETP inhibitor in the dispersion is "almost completely amorphous" meaning that the amount of CETP inhibitor in the crystalline form does not exceed about 10%.  Amounts of crystalline CETP inhibitor may be measured by powder X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), or any other standard quantitative measurement.<br>
The composition may contain from about 1 to about 80 wt% CETP inhibitor, depending on the dose of the CETP inhibitor and the effectiveness of the concentration-enhancing polymer.  Enhancement of aqueous CETP inhibitor concentrations and relative bioavailability are typically best at low CETP inhibitor levels, typically less than about 25 to 4 0 wt%.  However, due to the practical limit of the dosage form size,<br><br>
higher CETP inhibitor levels are often preferred and in many cases perform well.<br>
The amorphous CETP inhibitor can exist within the solid amorphous dispersion as a pure phase, as a solid solution of CETP inhibitor homogeneously distributed throughout the polymer or any combination of these states or those states that lie intermediate between them.  The dispersion is preferably substantially homogeneous so that the amorphous CETP inhibitor is dispersed as homogeneously as possible throughout the polymer.  As used herein, "substantially homogeneous" means that the fraction of CETP inhibitor that is present in relatively pure amorphous domains within the solid dispersion is  relatively small, on the order of less than 20%, and preferably less than 10% of the total amount of CETP inhibitor.<br>
While the dispersion may have some CETP inhibitor-rich domains, it is preferred that the dispersion itself have a single glass transition temperature (Tq) which demonstrates that the dispersion is substantially homogeneous.  This contrasts with a simple physical mixture of pure amorphous CETP inhibitor particles and pure amorphous polymer particles which generally display two distinct Tgs, one that of the CETP inhibitor and one that of the polymer.  Tg as used herein is the characteristic temperature where a glassy material, upon gradual heating, undergoes a relatively-rapid (e.g., 10 to 100 seconds) physical change from a glass state to a rubber state.  The Tg of an amorphous material such as a polymer, drug or dispersion can be measured by several techniques, including by a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), a dilatometer, dielectric analyzer, and by  a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).  The exact values measured by each technique can vary somewhat but usually fall within 10° to 3 0°C of each other.  Regardless of the technique used, when an amorphous dispersion exhibits a single Tg, this indicates<br><br>
that the dispersion is substantially homogenous. Dispersions of the present invention that are substantially homogeneous generally are more physically stable and have improved concentration-enhancing properties and, in turn improved bioavailability, relative to nonhomogeneous dispersions.<br>
The compositions comprising the CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer provide enhanced concentration of the dissolved CETP inhibitor in in  vitro dissolution tests.  It has been determined that enhanced drug concentration in in   vitro  dissolution tests in Model<br>
Fasted Duodenal (MFD) solution or Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) is a good indicator of in  vivo  performance<br>
and bioavailability.  An appropriate PBS solution is an aqueous solution comprising 20 mM sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) , 47 mM potassium phosphate (KH2P04) , 87 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM KCl, adjusted to pH 6.5 with NaOH.  An appropriate MFD solution is the same PBS solution wherein additionally is present 7.3 mM sodium taurocholic acid and 1.4 mM of l-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.  In particular, a composition of the present invention can be dissolution-tested by adding it to MFD or PBS solution and agitating to promote dissolution.  Generally, the amount of composition added to the solution in such a test is an amount that, if all the drug in the composition dissolved, would produce a CETP inhibitor concentration that is at least about 10-fold and preferably at least 100-fold the equilibrium solubility of the CETP inhibitor alone in the test solution.  To demonstrate even higher levels of dissolved CETP inhibitor concentration, addition of-even larger amounts of the composition is desirable.<br>
In one aspect, the compositions of the present invention provide a Maximum Drug Concentration (MDC) that is at least about 10-fold the equilibrium concentration of a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of CETP inhibitor but free from the polymer.  In<br><br>
other words, if the equilibrium concentration provided by the control composition is 1 μg/mL, then a composition of the present invention provides an MDC of at least about 1° μg/mL.  The- comparison composition is conventionally the undispersed CETP inhibitor alone (e.g.,   typically,<br>
the crystalline CETP inhibitor alone in its most thermodynamically stable crystalline form, or in cases where a crystalline form of the CETP inhibitor is unknown, the control may be the amorphous CETP inhibitor alone) or the CETP inhibitor plus a weight of inert diluent equivalent to the weight of polymer in the test composition.  Preferably, the MDC of CETP inhibitor achieved with the compositions of the present invention is at least about 50-fold, more preferably at least about 200-fold and even more preferably at least about 500-fold, the equilibrium concentration of the control composition.  Surprisingly, the present invention may achieve extremely large enhancements in aqueous concentration.  In some cases, the MDC of CETP inhibitor provided by the compositions of the present invention are 200-fold to more than 1000-fold the equilibrium concentration of the control composition.  For some CETP inhibitors, due to their extremely low aqueous solubilites, such large enhancements are required in order for the inhibitors to be sufficiently bioavailable when orally dosed.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention provide in an aqueous use environment a concentration versus time Area Under The Curve (AUC) , for any period of at least 90 minutes between the time of introduction into the use environment and about 270 minutes following introduction to the use environment, that is at least 5-fold that of a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of undispersed CETP inhibitor.  Preferably, the compositions of the present invention provide in an aqueous use environment a concentration versus time AUC, for any period of at least<br><br>
90 minutes between the time of introduction into the use environment and about 270 minutes following introduction to the use environment, that is at least about 25-fold, more preferably at least about 100-fold and even more preferably at least about 250-fold that of a control composition as described above.  Such large enhancements in aqueous concentration versus time AUC values are surprising given the extremely low aqueous solubility and hydrophobicity of most CETP inhibitors.<br>
A typical in  vitro  test to evaluate enhanced<br>
drug concentration in aqueous solution can be conducted by (1) adding with agitation a sufficient quantity of control composition, typically the CETP inhibitor alone, to the in   vitro  test medium, typically MFD or PBS<br>
solution, to achieve equilibrium concentration of the CETP inhibitor; (2) adding with agitation a sufficient quantity of test composition (e.g.,   the CETP inhibitor<br>
and polymer) in an equivalent test medium, such that if all the CETP inhibitor dissolved, the theoretical concentration of CETP inhibitor would exceed the equilibrium concentration of the CETP inhibitor by a factor of at least 10, and preferably a factor of at least 100; and (3) comparing the measured MDC and/or aqueous concentration versus time AUC of the test composition in the test medium with the equilibrium concentration, and/or the aqueous concentration versus time AUC of the control composition.  In conducting such a dissolution test, the amount of test composition or control composition used is an amount such that if all of the CETP inhibitor dissolved the CETP inhibitor concentration would be at least 10-fold and preferably at least 100-fold that of the equilibrium concentration. Indeed, for some extremely insoluble CETP inhibitors, in order to identify the MDC achieved it may be necessary to use an amount of test composition such that if all of the CETP inhibitor dissolved, the CETP inhibitor<br><br>
concentration would be 10,000-fold or even more, that of the equilibrium concentration of the CETP inhibitor.<br>
The concentration of dissolved CETP inhibitor is typically measured as a function of time by sampling the test medium and plotting CETP inhibitor concentration in the test medium vs. time so that the MDC can be ascertained.  The KDC is taken to be the maximum value of dissolved CETP inhibitor measured over the duration of the test.  The aqueous concentration of the CETP inhibitor versus time AUC is calculated by integrating the concentration versus time curve over any 90-minute time period between the time of introduction of the composition into the aqueous use environment (time equals zero) and 270 minutes following introduction to the use environment (time equals 270 minutes).  Typically, when the composition reaches its MDC rapidly, less than about 30 minutes, the time interval used to calculate AUC is from time equals zero to time equals 90 minutes. However, if the AUC over any 90-minute time period described above of a composition meets the criterion of this invention, then the composition is a part of this invention.<br>
To avoid large CETP inhibitor particulates which would give an erroneous determination, the test solution is either filtered or centrifuged.  "Dissolved CETP inhibitor" is typically taken as that material that either passes a 0,45 μm  syringe filter or, alternatively, the material that remains in the supernatant following centrifugation.  Filtration can be conducted using a 13 mm, 0.45 μm  polyvinylidine difluoride syringe filter sold by Scientific Resources under the trademark TITAN®. Centrifugation is typically carried out in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube by centrifuging at 13,000 G for 60 seconds.  Other similar filtration or centrifugation methods can be employed and useful results obtained.  For example, using other types of microfilters may yield values somewhat higher or lower (+10-4 0%) than<br><br>
that obtained with the filter specified above but. will still allow identification of preferred dispersions.  It is recognized that this definition of "dissolved CETP inhibitor" encompasses not only monomeric solvated CETP inhibitor molecules but also a wide range of species such as polymer/CETP inhibitor assemblies that have submicron dimensions such as CETP inhibitor aggregates, aggregates of mixtures of polymer and CETP inhibitor, micelles, polymeric micelles, colloidal particles or nanocrystals, polymer/CETP inhibitor complexes, and other such CETP inhibitor-containing species that are present in the filtrate or supernatant in the specified dissolution test -<br>
Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention, when dosed orally to a human or other animal, provide an AUC in CETP inhibitor concentration in the blood that is at least about 4-fold that observed when a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of undispersed drug is dosed.  It is noted that such compositions can also be said to have a relative bioavailability of about 4.  Preferably, the compositions of the present invention, when dosed orally to a human or other animal, provide an AUC in CETP inhibitor concentration in the blood that is at least about 6-fold, more preferably at least about 10-fold, and even more preferably at least about 20-fold that observed when a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of undispersed drug is dosed.  Thus, the compositions of the present invention can be evaluated in either in  vitro  or<br>
in  vivo  tests, or both.<br>
Relative bioavailability of CETP inhibitors in the dispersions of the present invention can be tested in<br>
vivo  in animals or humans using conventional methods for<br>
making such a determrnation.  An in vivo   test, such as a<br>
crossover study, may be used to determine whether a composition of CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing<br><br>
polymer provides ar. enhanced relative bioavailability compared with a control composition comprised of a CETP inhibitor but no polymer as described above.  In an in   vivo  crossover study a "test composition" of CETP inhibitor and polymer is dosed to half a group of test subjects and, after an appropriate washout period {e.g.,<br>
one week) the same subjects are dosed with a "control composition" that comprises an equivalent quantity of CETP inhibitor as the "test composition" (but with no polymer present).  The other half of the group is dosed with the control composition first, followed by the test composition.  The relative bioavailability is measured as the concentration in the blood (serum or plasma) versus time area under the curve (AUC) determined for the test group divided by the AUC in the blood provided by the control composition.  Preferably, this test/control ratio is determined for each subject, and then the ratios are averaged over all subjects in the study. In   vivo<br>
determinations of AUC can be made by plotting the serum or plasma concentration of drug along the ordinate (y-axis) against time along the abscissa (x-axis).<br>
Thus, as noted above, one embodiment of the present invention is one in which the relative bioavailability of the test composition is at least about 4 relative to a control composition comprised of a CETP inhibitor but with no polymer as described above.  (That is, the in  vivo  AUC provided by the test composition is<br>
at least about 4-fold the in  vivo  AUC provided by the<br>
control composition.)  A preferred embodiment of the invention is one in which the relative bioavailability of the test composition is at least about 6, and even more preferably at least about 10 relative to a control composition composed of the CETP inhibitor but with no polymer present, as described above.  The determination of AUCs is a well-known procedure and is described, for<br><br>
example, in Welling, "Pharmacokinetics Processes and Mathematics," ACS Monograph 185 (1986).<br>
The compositions of the present invention have particular utility when the "absolute bioavailability" of the CETP inhibitor is less than about 5%, and preferably less than about 1%.  By "absolute bioavailability" is meant the ratio of the area under the blood plasma or serum drug concentration versus time curve for oral dosing of a test composition to that obtained by intravenous dosing of a solution of the CETP inhibitor (or the lowest-energy amorphous form of the CETP inhibitor where a crystalline form is unknown).  Care must be taken when determining the absolute bioavailability of CETP inhibitors because their low solubility can result in precipitation of the crystalline form when dosed intravenously, leading to an inaccurate calculation of absolute bioavailability.  For CETP inhibitors with such absolute bioavailabilities less than about 5%, the compositions of the present invention preferably provide a relative bioavailability that is at least about 6-fold relative to a control composition comprised of the CETP inhibitor but with no polymer present, as described above.  More preferably, when the absolute bioavailability of the CETP inhibitor is less than about 1%, the compositions of the present invention provide relative bioavailability that is at least about 10-fold, and even more preferably at least about 20-fold relative to a control composition, as described above.<br>
CHOLESTERYL ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN INHIBITORS The invention is useful for CETP inhibitors which have sufficiently low aqueous solubility, low bioavailability or slow rate of absorption such that it is desirable to increase their concentration in an aqueous environment of use.  Therefore, anytime one finds it desirable to raise the aqueous concentration of the CETP inhibitor in a use environment, the invention will<br><br>
find utility.  The CETP inhibitor is "substantially water-insoluble" which means that the CETP inhibitor has a minimum aqueous solubility of less than about 0.01 rng/mL (or 10 μg/ml)   at any physiologically relevant pH (e.g.,   pH 1-8) and at about 22°C.  (Unless otherwise<br>
specified, reference to aqueous solubility herein and in the claims is determined at about 22°C.)      Compositions of the present invention find greater utility as the solubility of the CETP inhibitors decreases, and thus are preferred for CETP inhibitors with solubilities less than about 2 μg/mL,   and even more preferred for CETP inhibitors with solubilities less than about 0.5 μg/mL. Many CETP inhibitors have even lower solubilities (some even less than 0.1 μg/mL) , and require dramatic concentration enhancement to be sufficiently bioavailable upon oral dosing for effective plasma concentrations to be reached at practical doses.<br>
In general, it may be said that the CETP inhibitor has a dose-to-aqueous solubility ratio greater than about 100 mL, where the solubility (mg/mL) is the minimum value observed in any physiologically relevant aqueous solution (e.g., those with pH values from 1 to 8) including USP simulated gastric and intestinal buffers, and dose is in mg.  Compositions of the present invention, as mentioned above, find greater utility as the solubility of the CETP inhibitor decreases and the dose increases.  Thus, the compositions are preferred as the dose-to-solubility ratio increases, and thus are preferred for dose-to-solubility ratios greater than 1000 mL, and more preferred for dose-to-solubility ratios greater than about 5000 ml.<br>
Oral delivery of many CETP inhibitors is particularly difficult because their aqueous solubility is usually extremely low, typically being less than 2 μg/ml, often being less than 0.1 μg/ml.  Such low solubilities are a direct consequence of the particular structural characteristics of species that bind to CETP<br><br>
and thus act as   CETP  inhibitors.  This low solubility is primarily due to the hydrophobic nature of CETP ' inhibitors.  Clog P, defined as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of the drug solubility in octanol to.the drug solubility in water, is a widely accepted measure of hydrophobicity.  In general, Clog P values for CETP inhibitors are greater than 4 and are often greater than 5 to 7.  Thus, the hydrophobic and insoluble nature of CETP inhibitors as a class pose a particular challenge for oral delivery.  Achieving therapeutic drug levels in the blood by oral dosing of practical quantities of drug generally requires a large enhancement in drug concentrations in the gastrointestinal fluid and a resulting large enhancement in   bioavailability. Such enhancements in drug concentration in gastrointestsinal fluid typically need to be at least about 10-fold and often at least about 50-fold or even at least about 200-fold to achieve desired blood levels.  Surprisingly, the dispersions of the present invention have proven to have the required large enhancements in drug concentration and bioavailability.<br>
In contrast; to conventional wisdom, the relative degree of enhancement in aqueous concentration and bioavailability generally improves for CETP inhibitors as solubility decreases and hydrophobocity increases..  In fact, the inventors have recognized a subclass of these CETP inhibitors that are essentially aqueous insoluble, highly hydrophobic, and are characterized by a set of physical properties.  This subclass exhibits dramatic enhancements in aqueous concentration and bioavailability when formulated using the compositions of the present invention.<br>
, The first property of this subclass of essentially insoluble, hydrophobic CETP inhibitors is extremely low aqueous solubility.  By extremely low aqueous solubility is meant that the minimum aqueous solubility at physiologically relevant pH (pH of 1 to 8)<br><br>
is less than about 10 fig/ml   and preferably less than about 1 μg/ml.<br>
A second property is a very high does-to-solubility ratio.  Extremely low solubility often leads to poor or slow absorption of the drug from the fluid of the gastrointestinal tract, when the drug is dosed orally in a conventional manner.  For extremely low solubility drugs, poor absorption generally becomes progressively more difficult as the dose (mass of drug given orally) increases.  Thus, a second property of this subclass of essentially insoluble, hydrophobic CETP inhibitors is a very high dose (in mg) to solubility (in mg/ml) ratio (ml).  By "very high dose-to-solubility ratio" is meant that the dose-to-solubility ratio has a value of at least 1000 ml, and preferably at least 5,000 ml, and more preferably at least 10,000 ml.<br>
A third property of this subclass of essentially insoluble, hydrophobic CETP inhibitors is that they are extremely hydrophobic.  By extremely hydrophobic is meant that the Clog P value of the drug, has a value of at least 4.0, preferably a value of at least 5.0, and more preferably a value of at least 5.5.<br>
A fourth property of this subclass of essentially insoluble CETP inhibitors is that they have a low melting point.  Generally, drugs of this subclass will have a melting point of about 150°C or less, and preferably about 140°C or less.<br>
Primarily, as a consequence of some or all of these four properties, CETP inhibitors of this subclass typically have very low absolute bioavailabilities. Specifically, the absolute bioavailibility of drugs in this subclass when dosed orally in their undispersed state is 'less than about 10% and more often less than about 5%.<br>
For this subclass of CETP inhibitors, the CETP inhibitor, when dispersed in the dispersion, should be at least substantially amorphous, and more preferably is<br><br>
almost completely amorphous.  In addition, the dispersion should be substantially homogeneous.  As discussed below, such dispersions may be made by solvent processing, and preferably by  spray-drying.  When prepared in this fashion, this class of essentially insoluble, hydrophobic CETP inhibitors often exhibits dramatic enhancements in aqueous concentration in the use environment and in bioavailability when dosed orally.  While the degree of enhancement will depend on the particular concentration-enhancing polymer, when preferred concentration-enhancing polymers are used (as discussed below), such compositions may provide a MDC in an aqueous use environment that is at least about 50-fold, and preferably at least about 200-fold, the equilibrium concentration of a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of the essentially insoluble, hydrophobic CETP inhibitor but free from the concentration-enhancing polymer.  Likewise, the compositions also display in an aqueous use environment an AUC, for any period of at least 90 minutes between the time of introduction into the use environment and about 270 minutes following introduction into the use environment that is at least about 25-fold, and preferably at least about 100-fold, that of the control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of drug but free from the concentration-enhancing polymer.<br>

CONCENTRATION-ENHANCING POLYMERS Concentration-enhancing polymers suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention should be inert, in the sense that they do not chemically react with the CETP inhibitor in an adverse manner, are. pharmaceutically acceptable, and have at least some solubility in aqueous solution at physiologically relevant pHs (e.g. 1-8).  The polymer can be neutral or ionizable, and should have an aqueous-solubility of at least 0.1 mg/mL over at least a portion of the pH range of 1-8.<br>
The polymer is a "concentration-enhancing polymer," meaning that it meets at least one, and more preferably both, of the following conditions.  The first condition is that the concentration-enhancing polymer increases the MDC of the CETP inhibitor in the<br><br>
environment of use relative to a control composition consisting of an equivalent amount of the CETP inhibitor but no polymer.  That is, once the composition is introduced into an environment of use, the polymer increases the aqueous concentration of CETP inhibitor relative to the control composition.  Preferably, the polymer increases the MDC of the CETP inhibitor in aqueous solution by  at least 10-fold relative to a-control composition, preferably by at least 50-fold, and more preferably by at least 200-fold.  Even more preferably, the polymer increases the MDC of the CETP inhibitor in aqueous solution by at least 500-fold, and most preferably by at least 1000-fold.  Such larg-e enhancements may be necessary in order for some extremely water insoluble CETP inhibitors to achieve effective blood levels through oral dosing.  The second condition is that the concentration-enhancing polymer increases the AUC of the CETP inhibitor in the environment of use relative to a control composition consisting of CETP inhibitor but no polymer as described above.  That is, in the environment of use, the composition comprising the CETP inhibitor and the concentration-enhancing polymer provides an area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) for any period of 9 0 minutes between the time of introduction into the use environment and about 2 70 minutes following introduction to the use environment that is at least 5-fold that of a control composition comprising an equivalent quantity of CETP inhibitor but no polymer.  Preferably, the AUC provided by the composition is at least 25-fold, more preferably at least 100-fold, and even more preferably at least 250-fold that of the control composition.<br>
Concentration-enhancing polymers suitable for use with the present invention may be cellulosic or non-cellulosic.  The polymers may be neutral or ionizable in aqueous solution.  Of these, ionizable and cellulosic<br><br>
polymers are preferred, with ionizable cellulosic polymers being more preferred.<br>
A preferred class of polymers comprises polymers that are "amphiphilic" in nature, meaning that the polymer has hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. The hydrophobic portion may comprise groups such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon groups.  The hydrophilic portion may comprise either ionizable or non-ionizable groups that are capable of hydrogen bonding such as hydroxyls, carboxylic acids, esters, amines or amides.<br>
Amphiphilic and/or ionizable polymers .are preferred because it is believed that such polymers may tend to have relatively strong interactions with the CETP inhibitor and may promote the formation of the various types of polymer/drug assemblies in the use environment as described previously.  In addition, the repulsion of the like charges of the ionized groups of such polymers may serve to limit the size of the polymer/drug assemblies to the nanometer or submicron scale.  For example, while not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, such polymer/drug assemblies may comprise hydrophobic CETP inhibitor clusters surrounded by the polymer with the polymer's hydrophobic regions turned inward towards the CETP inhibitor and the hydrophilic regions of the polymer turned outward toward the aqueous environment.  Alternatively, depending on the specific chemical nature of the CETP inhibitor, the ionized functional groups of the polymer may associate, for example, via ion pairing or hydrogen bonds, with ionic or polar groups of the CETP inhibitor.  In the case of ionizable polymers, the hydrophilic regions of the polymer would include the ionized functional groups^ Such polymer/drug assemblies in solution may well resemble charged polymeric micellar-like structures.  In any case, regardless of the mechanism of action, the inventors have observed that such amphiphilic polymers,<br><br>
particularly ionizable cellulosic polymers, have been shown to improve the MDC and/or AUC of CETP inhibitor in aqueous solution relative to  control compositions free from such polymers.<br>
Surprisingly, such amphophilic polymers can greatly enhance the maximum concentration of CETP inhibitor obtained when CETP inhibitor is dosed to a use environment.  In addition, such amphiphilic polymers interact with the CETP inhibitor to prevent the precipitation or crystallization of the CETP inhibitor from solution despite its concentration being substantially above its equilibrium concentration.  In particular, when the preferred compositions are solid amorphous dispersions of the CETP inhibitor and the concentration-enhancing polymer, the compositions provide a  greatly enhanced drug concentration, particularly when the dispersions are substantially homogeneous.  The maximum drug concentration may be 10-fold and often more than 50-fold the equilibrium concentration of the crystalline CETP inhibitor.  Indeed, for some extremely water insoluble CETP inhibitors, the maximum drug concentration may be 200-fold to 500-fold and often more than 1000-fold the equilibrium concentration of the crystalline CETP inhibitor.  Such enhanced CETP inhibitor concentrations in turn lead to substantially enhanced relative bioavailability for the CETP inhibitor.<br>
One class of polymers suitable for use with the present invention comprises neutral non-cellulosic polymers.  Exemplary polymers include:  vinyl polymers and copolymers having substituents of hydroxyl, alkylacyloxy, and cyclicamido polyvinyl alcohols that have at least a portion of their repeat units in the unhydrolyzed (vinyl acetate) form,- polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl acetate copolymers; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and polyethylene polyvinyl alcohol copolymers.<br>
Another class of polymers suitable for use with the present invention comprises ionizable non-cellulosic<br><br>
polymers.      Exemplary polymers   include:      carboxylic   acid-functionalized vinyl polymers,   such  as   the   carboxylic acid   functionalized polymethacrylates  and  carboxylic  acid functionalized  polyacrylates   such  as   the  EUDRAGITS® manufactured by Rohm Tech   Inc.,   of   Maiden,   Massachusetts; amine-f unctionalized polyacrylates   and  polymethacrylates,-proteins;   and  carboxylic   acid  functionalized   starches such  as   starch glycolate.<br>
Non-cellulosic  polymers   that   are   amphiphilic are  copolymers  of  a  relatively  hydrophilic  and  a relatively  hydrophobic  monomer.      Examples   include acrylate   and methacrylate   copolymers.      Exemplary commercial   grades  of  such   copolymers   include   the EUDRAGITS,   which  are  copolymers   of   methacrylates  and acrylates.<br>
A preferred  class  of  polymers   comprises ionizable   and  neutral   cellulosic  polymers with  at   least one  ester-   and/or  ether-   linked   substituent   in  which  the polymer  has  a  degree  of   substitution  of   at   least   0.1   for each  substituent.      It   should be  noted  that   in  the  polymer nomenclature  used herein,   ether-linked  substituents  are recited prior to "cellulose" as   the  moiety attached  to   the ether  group;   for example,   "ethylbenzoic  acid  cellulose" has  ethoxybenzoic  acid  substituents.     Analogously, ester-linked  substituents   are  recited after  "cellulose"   as the  carboxylate;   for example,   "cellulose phthalate"  has one  carboxylic  acid of  each phthalate moiety  ester-linked to the  polymer and the  other carboxylic  acid unreacted.<br>
It   should also  be  noted   that   a polymer name such as  "cellulose acetate phthalate"   (CAP)   refers   to  any of  the   family  of  cellulosic polymers  that  have   acetate and phthalate  groups  attached via   ester  linkages   to  a significant   fraction of  the  cellulosic  polymer's  hydroxyl groups.      Generally,   the  degree  of   substitution of   each substituent  group can range  from  0.1  to  2.9  as  long as the  other  criteria of  the polymer  are met.     "Degree  of substitution"  refers   to  the  average  number of   the   three<br><br>
hydroxyls per saccharide repeat unit on the cellulose chain that have been substituted.  For example, if all of the hydroxyls on the cellulose chain have been phthalate substituted, the phthalate degree of substitution is 3. Also included within each polymer family type are cellulosic polymers that have additional substituents added in relatively small amounts that do not substantially alter the performance of the polymer.<br>
Amphiphilic cellulosics may be prepared by substituting the cellulose at any or all of the 3 hydroxyl substituents present on each saccharide repeat unit with at least one  relatively hydrophobic substituent.  Hydrophobic substituents may be essentially any substituent that, if substituted to a high enough level or degree of substitution, can render the cellulosic polymer essentially aqueous insoluble. Hydrophilic regions of the polymer can be either those portions that are relatively unsubstituted, since the unsubstituted hydroxyls are themselves relatively hydrophilic, or those regions that are substituted with hydrophilic substituents.  Examples of hydrophobic substitutents include ether-linked alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl,• propyl, butyl, etc.; or ester-linked alkyl groups such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, etc.; and ether- and/or ester-linked aryl groups such as phenyl, benzoate, or phenylate.  Hydrophilic groups include ether- or ester-linked nonionizable groups such as the hydroxy alkyl substituents hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, and the alkyl ether groups such as ethoxyethoxy or methoxyethoxy.  Particularly preferred hydrophilic substituents are those that are ether- or ester-linked ionizable groups such as carboxylic acids, thiocarboxylic acids, substituted phenoxy groups, amines, phosphates or sulfonates.<br>
One class of cellulosic polymers comprises, neutral polymers, meaning that the polymers are substantially non-ionizable in aqueous solution.  Such<br><br>
polymers contain non-ionizable substituents, which may be either ether-linked or ester-linked.  Exemplary ether-linked non-ionizable substituents include: alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, etc.,- hydroxy alkyl groups such as hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, etc.; and aryl groups such as phenyl. Exemplary ester-linked non-ionizable groups include.-alkyl groups, such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, etc.; and aryl groups such as phenylate.  However, when aryl groups are included, the polymer may need to include a sufficient amount of a hydrophilic substituent so that the polymer has at least some water solubility at any physiologically relevant pH of from 1 to 8.<br>
Exemplary non-ionizable polymers that may be used as the polymer include:  hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose acetate, and hydroxyethyl ethyl cellulose.<br>
A preferred set of neutral cellulosic polymers are those that are amphiphilic.  Exemplary polymers include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate, where cellulosic repeat units that have relatively high numbers of methyl or acetate substituents relative to the unsubstituted hydroxyl or hydroxypropyl substituents constitute hydrophobic regions relative to other repeat units on the polymer.<br>
A preferred class of cellulosic polymers comprises polymers that are at least partially ionizable at physiologically relevant pH and include at least one ionizable substituent, which may be either ether-linked or ester-linked.  Exemplary ether-linked ionizable substituents include:  carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, alkoxybenzoic acids such as ethoxybenzoic acid or propoxybenzoic acid, the various isomers of alkoxyphthalic acid such as ethoxyphthalic acid and<br><br>
ethoxyisophthalic   acid,   the  various   isomers   of alkoxynicotinic   acid  such  as   ethoxynicotinic   acid,   and the  various   isomers   of  picolinic  acid  such  as ethoxypicolinic   acid,    etc.;   thiocarboxylic   acids,   such   as thioacetic   acid;   substituted  phenoxy groups,    such as hydroxyphenoxy,   etc.;   amines,   such  as   aminoethoxy, diethylaminoethoxy,    trimethylaminoethoxy,   etc.; phosphates,   such  as  phosphate  ethoxy;   and  sulfonates, such  as   sulphonate   ethoxy.     Exemplary  ester   linked ionizable   substituents   include:     carboxylic   acids,   such as   succinate,   citrate,   phthalate,   terephthalate, isophthalate,   trimellitate,   and  the various   isomers  of pyridinedicarboxylic   acid,   etc.;   thiocarboxylic  acids, such  as  thiosuccinate,-   substituted phenoxy groups,   such as   amino  salicylic  acid;   amines,   such  as  natural  or synthetic  amino  acids,   such as  alanine  or phenylalanine; phosphates,   such  as  acetyl   phosphate;   and  sulfonates, such  as  acetyl   sulfonate.      For aromatic-substituted polymers  to  also  have   the  requisite  aqueous   solubility, it   is  also  desirable   that  sufficient  hydrophilic groups such  as  hydroxypropyl   or  carboxylic  acid  functional groups  be  attached  to  the  polymer to  render  the polymer aqueous   soluble  at   least  at  pH values  where   any  ionizable groups  are  ionized.      In  some  cases,   the  aromatic group may  itself  be  ionizable,   such  as phthalate  or trimellitate  substituents.<br>
Exemplary cellulosic polymers   that   are at   least partially  ionized  at  physiologically  relevant  pHs include:     hydroxypropyl  methyl  cellulose  acetate succinate,   hydroxypropyl  methyl  cellulose  succinate, hydroxypropyl   cellulose  acetate  succinate,   hydroxyethyl methyl  cellulose   succinate,   hydroxyethyl   cellulose acetate  succinate,   hydroxypropyl  methyl   cellulose phthalate,   hydroxyethyl  methyl  cellulose  acetate succinate,   hydroxyethyl methyl  cellulose  acetate phthalate,   carboxyethyl   cellulose,   carboxymethyl cellulose,   cellulose  acetate phthalate,   methyl   cellulose<br><br>
acetate phthalate, ethyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate phthalate succinate, hydroxypropyl     methyl cellulose acetate succinate phthalate,<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose succinate phthalate, cellulose propionate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose butyrate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, ethyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate trimellitate succinate, cellulose propionate trimellitate, cellulose butyrate trimellitate, cellulose acetate terephthalate, cellulose acetate isophthalate, cellulose acetate pyridinedicarboxylate, salicylic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl salicylic acid cellulose acetate, ethylbenzoic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl ethylbenzoic acid cellulose acetate, ethyl phthalic acid cellulose acetate, ethyl nicotinic acid cellulose acetate, and ethyl picolinic acid cellulose acetate.<br>
Exemplary cellulosic polymers that meet the definition of amphiphilic, having hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions include polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate and cellulose acetate trimellitate where the cellulosic repeat units that have one or more acetate substituents are hydrophobic relative to those that have no  acetate substituents or have one or more ionized phthalate or trimellitate substituents.<br>
A particularly desirable subset of cellulosic ionizable polymers are those that possess both a carboxylic acid functional aromatic substituent and an alkylate substituent and thus are amphiphilic.  Exemplary polymers include cellulose acetate phthalate, methyl-cellulose acetate phthalate, ethyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate phthalate.<br><br>
hydroxylpropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate phthalate succinate, cellulose propionate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose butyrate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, ethyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate trimellitate succinate, cellulose propionate trimellitate, cellulose butyrate trimellitate, cellulose acetate terephthalate, cellulose acetate isophthalate, cellulose acetate pyridinedicarboxylate, salicylic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl salicylic acid cellulose acetate, ethylbenzoic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl ethylbenzoic acid cellulose acetate, ethyl phthalic acid cellulose acetate, ethyl nicotinic acid cellulose acetate, and ethyl picolinic acid cellulose acetate.<br>
Another particularly desirable subset of cellulosic ionizable polymers are those that possess a non-aromatic carboxylate substituent.  Exemplary polymers include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose succinate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose succinate, and hydroxyethyl cellulose acetate succinate.<br>
While, as listed above, a wide range of polymers may be used to form dispersions of CETP inhibitors, the inventors have found that relatively hydrophobic polymers have shown the best performance as demonstrated by nigh MDC and AUC values.  In particular, cellulosic polymers that are aqueous insoluble in their nonionized state but are aqueous soluble in their ionized state perform particularly well.  A particular subclass of such polymers are the so-called "enteric" polymers<br><br>
which include, for example, certain grades of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate and cellulose acetate trimellitate.  Dispersions formed from such polymers generally show very large enhancements, on the order of 50-fold to over 1000-fold, in the maximum drug concentration achieved in dissolution tests relative to that for a crystalline drug control.  In addition, non-enteric grades of such polymers as well as closely related cellulosic polymers are expected to perform well due to the similarities in physical properties within the CETP inhibitor class.<br>
Thus, especially preferred polymers are hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate terephthalate and cellulose acetate isophthalate.  The most preferred polymers are hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, and cellulose acetate trimellitate.<br>
While specific polymers have been discussed as being suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention, blends of such polymers may also be suitable. Thus the term "polymer" is intended to include blends of polymers in addition to a single species of polymer.<br>
To obtain the best performance, particularly upon storage for long times prior to use, it is preferred that the CETP inhibitor remain, to the extent possible, in the amorphous state.  The inventors have found that this is best achieved when the glass-transition temperature, T9, of the amorphous CETP inhibitor material is substantially above the storage temperature of the composition.  In particular, it is preferable that the Tg of the amorphous state of the CETP inhibitor be at least 40°c and preferably at least 60°C.  For those aspects of<br><br>
the invention in which the composition is a solid, substantially amorphous dispersion of CETP inhibitor in the concentration-enhancing polymer and in which the CETp inhibitor itself has a relatively low Tg (about 70°C or less) it is preferred that the concentration-enhancing polymer have a Tq of at least 40°C, preferably at least 70°C and more preferably greater than 100°C.  Exemplary high Tg polymers include HPMCAS, KPMCP, CAP, CAT and other ceilulosics that have alkylate or aromatic substituents or both alkylate and aromatic substituents.<br>
In addition, the preferred polymers listed above, that is amphophilic cellulosic polymers, tend to have greater concentration-enhancing properties relative to the other polymers of the present invention.  For any particular CETP inhibitor, the amphophilic cellulosic with the best concentration-enhancing properties may vary.  However, the inventors have found that generally those that have ionizable substituents tend to perform best. In  vitro  tests of compositions with such polymers<br>
tend to have higher MDC and AUC values than compositions with other polymers of the invention.<br>
PREPARATION OF COMPOSITIONS Dispersions of the CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer may be made according to any known process which results in at least a major portion (at least 60%) of the CETP inhibitor being in the amorphous state.  Exemplary mechanical processes include milling and extrusion; melt processes include high temperature fusion, solvent modified fusion and melt-congeal processes; and solvent processes include non-solvent precipitation, spray coating and spray-drying. Although the dispersions of the present invention may be made by any of these processes, the dispersions generally<br><br>
have their maximum bioavailability and stability when the CETP inhibitor is- dispersed in the polymer such that it is substantially amorphous and substantially homogeneously distributed throughout the polymer.<br>
In general, as the degree of homogeneity of the dispersion increases, the enhancement in the aqueous concentration of the CETP inhibitor and relative bioavailability increases as well.  Given the extremely low aqueous solubility and bioavailability of many CETP inhibitors, it is often highly preferred for the dispersions to be as homogeneous as possible to achieve therapeutically effective levels of CETP inhibitors. Thus, most preferred are dispersions having a single glass transition temperature, which indicates a high degree of homogeneity.<br>
Although in some cases substantially amorphous and substantially homogeneous dispersions may be made by any of the methods described above, it has been found that such dispersions are preferably formed by "solvent processing," which consists of dissolution of the CETP inhibitor and one or more polymers in a common solvent. "Common" here means that the solvent, which can be a mixture of compounds, will simultaneously dissolve the drug and the polymer(s).  After both the CETP inhibitor and the polymer have been dissolved, the solvent is rapidly removed by evaporation or by mixing with a non-solvent.  Exemplary processes are spray-drying, spray-coating (pan-coating, fluidized bed coating, etc.), and precipitation by rapid mixing of the polymer and drug solution with C02,   water, or some other non-solvent. Preferably, removal of the solvent results in a solid dispersion which is substantially homogeneous.  As described previously, in such substantially homogeneous dispersions, the CETP inhibitor is dispersed as homogeneously as possible throughout the polymer and can be thought of as a solid solution of CETP inhibitor dispersed in the polymer(s).  When the resulting<br><br>
dispersion constitutes a solid solution of CETP inhibitor in polymer, the dispersion may be thermodynamically stable, meaning that the concentration of CETP inhibitor in the polymer is at or below its equilibrium value, or it may be considered a supersaturated solid solution where the CETP inhibitor concentration in the dispersion polymer(s) is above its equilibrium value.<br>
The solvent may be removed through the process of spray-drying.  The term spray-drying is used conventionally and broadly refers to processes involving breaking up liquid mixtures into small droplets (atomization) and rapidly removing solvent from the mixture in a container (spray-drying apparatus) where there is a strong driving force for evaporation of solvent from the droplets.  The strong driving force for solvent evaporation is generally provided by maintaining the partial pressure of solvent in the spray-drying apparatus well below the vapor pressure of the solvent at the temperature of the drying droplets.  This is accomplished by either (1) maintaining the pressure in the spray-drying apparatus at a partial vacuum (e.g., 0.01 to 0.50 atm); (2) mixing the liquid droplets with a warm drying gas; or (3) both.  In addition, at least a portion of the heat required for evaporation of solvent may be provided by heating the spray solution.<br>
Solvents suitable for spray-drying can be any organic compound in which the CETP inhibitor and polymer are mutually soluble.  Preferably, the solvent is also volatile with a boiling point of 150DC or less.  In addition, the solvent should have relatively low toxicity and be removed from the dispersion to a level that is acceptable according to The International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  Removal of solvent_to this level may require a processing step such as tray-drying subsequent to the spray-drying or spray-coating process.  Preferred solvents include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, and butanol;<br><br>
ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl iso-butyl ketone; esters such as ethyl acetate and propylacetate; and various other solvents such as acetonitrile, methylene chloride, toluene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.  Lower volatility solvents such as. dimethyl acetamide or dimethylsulfoxide can also be used. Mixtures of solvents, such as 50% methanol and 50% acetone, can also be used, as can mixtures with water as long as the polymer and CETP inhibitor are sufficiently soluble to make the spray-drying process practicable. Generally, due to the hydrophobic nature of CETP inhibitors, non-aqueous solvents are preferred meaning that the solvent comprises less than about 10 wt% water, and preferably less than 1 wt% water.<br>
Generally, the temperature and flow rate of the drying gas is chosen so  that the polymer/drug-solution droplets are dry enough by the time they reach the wall or the apparatus that they are essentially solid, and so that they form a fine powder and do not stick to the apparatus wall.  The actual length of time to achieve this level of dryness depends on the size of the droplets.  Droplet sizes generally range from 1  fμm to 500 μm  in diameter, with 5 to 100 μm  being more typical. The large surface-to-volume ratio of the droplets and the large driving force for evaporation of solvent leads to actual drying times of a few seconds or less, and more typically less than 0.1 second.  This rapid drying is often critical to the particles maintaining a uniform, homogeneous dispersion instead of separating into drug-rich and polymer-rich phases.  As above, to get large enhancements in concentration and bioavailability it is often necessary to obtain as homogeneous of a dispersion as possible.  Solidification times should be less than 100 seconds, preferably less than a few seconds, and more preferably less than 1 second.  In general, to achieve this rapid solidification of the CETP inhibitor/polymer solution, it is preferred that the size of droplets<br><br>
formed during the spray-drying process are less than about 100 μm   in diameter.  The resultant solid particles thus formed are generally less than about 100 /urn  in diameter.<br>
Following solidification, the solid powder typically stays in the spray-drying chamber for about 5 to 60   seconds, further evaporating solvent from the solid powder.  The final solvent content of the solid dispersion as it exits the dryer should be low, since this reduces the mobility of CETP inhibitor molecules in the dispersion, thereby improving its stability. Generally, the solvent content of the dispersion as it leaves the. spray-drying chamber should be less than 10 wt% and preferably less than 2 wt%.  In some cases, it may be preferable to spray a solvent or a solution of a polymer or other excipient into the spray-drying chamber to form granules, so long as the dispersion is not adversely affected.<br>
Spray-drying processes and spray-drying equipment are described generally in Perry's Chemical Engineers'   Handbook,   Sixth Edition (R. H. Perry, D. W. Green, J. O. Maloney, eds.) McGraw-Hill Book Co.   1984, pages 20-54 to 20-57.  More details on spray-drying processes and equipment are reviewed by Marshall "Atomization and Spray-Drying, " 50 Chem.   Eng.   Prog.<br>

The amount of concentration-enhancing polymer relative to the amount of CETP inhibitor present in the dispersions of the present invention depends on the CETP inhibitor and polymer and may vary widely from a CETP inhibitor-to-polymer weight ratio of from 0.01 to about 4 (e.g., 1 wt% CETP inhibitor tc 00 wt% CETP inhibitor). However, in most cases it is preferred that the CETP inhibitor-to-polymer ratio is greater than about 0.05 (4.8 wt% CETP inhibitor) and less than about 2.5 (71 wt% CETP inhibitor) .  Often the enhancement in CETP inhibitor<br><br>
Conventional matrix materials, complexing agents, solubilizers, fillers, disintegrating agents (disintegrants), or binders may also be added as part of the composition itself or added by granulation via wet or mechanical or other means.  These materials may comprise up to 90 wt% of the composition.<br>
Examples of matrix materials, fillers, or diluents include lactose, mannitol, xylitol, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium diphosphate, and starch.<br>
Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium alginate, carboxy methyl cellulose sodium, methyl cellulose, and croscarmellose sodium.<br>
Examples of binders include methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, and gums such as guar gum, and tragacanth.<br>
Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate and calcium stearate.<br>
Other conventional excipients may be employed in the compositions of this invention, including those excipients well-known in the art.  Generally, excipients such as pigments, lubricants, flavorants, and so forth may be used for customary purposes and in typical amounts without adversely affecting the properties of the compositions.  These excipients may be utilized in order to formulate the composition into tablets, capsules, suspensions, powders for suspension, creams, transdermal patches, and the like.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be delivered by a wide variety of routes, including, but not limited to, oral, nasal, rectal, and pulmonary. Generally, the oral route is preferred.<br>
Compositions of this invention may also be used in a wide variety of dosage forms for administration of CSTP inhibitors.  Exemplary dosage forms are powders ' or granules that may be taken orally either dry or reconstituted by addition of water or other liquids to<br><br>
other dosage form ingredients in essentially any manner that does not substantially alter the CETP inhibitor. The excipients may be either physically mixed with the dispersion and/or included within the dispersion.<br>
One very useful class of excipients is surfactants.  Suitable surfactants include fatty acid and alkyl sulfonates; commercial surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride (HYAMINE® 1622, available from Lonsa, Inc., Fairlawn, New Jersey); dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, DOCUSATE SODIUM™ (available from Mallinckrodt Spec. Chem., St. Louis, Missouri); polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (TWEEN®, available from ICI Americas Inc., Wilmington, Delaware; LIPOSORB® P-20 available from Lipochem Inc., Patterson New Jersey; CAPMUL® POE-0 available from Abitec Corp., Janesville, Wisconsin), and natural surfactants such as sodium taurocholic acid, l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, lecithin, and other phospholipids and mono- and diglycerides.  Such materials can advantageously be employed to increase the rate of dissolution by facilitating wetting, thereby increasing the maximum dissolved concentration, and also to inhibit crystallization or precipitation of drug by interacting with the dissolved drug by mechanisms such as complexation, formation of inclusion complexes, formation of micelles or adsorbing to the surface of solid drug, crystalline or amorphous.  These surfactants may comprise up to 5 wt% of the composition.<br>
The addition of pH modifiers such as acids, bases, or buffers may also be beneficial, retarding the dissolution of the composition (e.g., acids such as citric acid or succinic acid when the concentration-enhancing polymer is anionic) or, alternatively, enhancing the rate of dissolution of the composition (e.g., bases such as sodium acetate or amines when the polymer is anionic).<br><br>
Conventional matrix materials, complexing agents, solubilizers, fillers, disintegrating agents (disintegrants), or binders may also be added as part of the composition itself or added by granulation via wet or mechanical or other means.  These materials may comprise up to 90 wt% of the composition.<br>
Examples of matrix materials, fillers, or diluents include lactose, mannitol, xylitol, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium diphosphate, and starch.<br>
Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium alginate, carboxy methyl cellulose sodium, methyl cellulose, and croscarmellose sodium.<br>

Other conventional excipients may be employed in the compositions of this invention, including those excipients well-known in the art-  Generally, excipients such as pigments, lubricants, flavorants, and so forth may be used for customary purposes and in typical amounts without adversely affecting the properties of the compositions.  These excipients may be utilized in order to formulate the composition into tablets, capsules, suspensions, powders for suspension, creams, transdermal patches, and the like.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be delivered by a wide variety of routes, including, but not limited to, oral, nasal, rectal, and pulmonary. Generally, the oral route is preferred.<br>
Compositions of this invention may also be used in a wide variety of dosage forms for administration of CSTP inhibitors.  Exemplary dosage forms are powders ' or granules that may be taken orally either dry or reconstituted by addition of water or other liquids to<br><br>
form a paste, slurry, suspension or solution; tablets; capsules; multiparticulates; and pills.  Various additives may be mixed, ground, or granulated with the compositions of this invention to form a material suitable for the above dosage forms.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in various forms such that they are delivered as a suspension of particles in a liquid vehicle.  Such suspensions may be formulated as a liquid or paste at the time of manufacture, or they may be formulated as a dry powder with a liquid, typically water, added at a later time but prior to oral administration.  Such powders that are constituted into a suspension-are often termed sachets or oral powder for constitution (OPC) formulations.  Such dosage forms can be formulated and reconstituted via any known procedure. The simplest approach is to formulate the dosage form as a dry powder that is reconstituted by simply adding water and agitating.  Alternatively, the dosage form may be formulated as a liquid and a dry powder that are combined and agitated to form the oral suspension.  In yet another embodiment, the dosage form can be formulated as two powders which are reconstituted by first adding water to one powder to form a solution to which the second powder is combined with agitation to form the suspension.<br>
Generally, it is preferred that the dispersion of CETP inhibitor be formulated for long-term storage in the dry state as this promotes the chemical and physical stability of the CETP inhibitor.  Various excipients and additives are combined with the compositions of the present invention to form the dosage form.  For example, it may be desirable to add some or all of the following: preservatives such as sulfites (an antioxidant) , benzalkonium chloride, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol or sodium benzoate; suspending agents or thickeners such as xanthan gum, starch, guar gum, sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl<br><br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid, silica gel, aluminum silicate, magnesium silicate, or titanium dioxide; anticaking agents or fillers such as silicon oxide, or lactose; flavorants such as natural or artificial flavors; sweeteners such as sugars such as sucrose, lactose, or sorbitol as well as artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or saccharin; wetting agents or surfactants such as various grades of polysorbate, docusate sodium, or sodium lauryl sulfate; solubilizers such as ethanol propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; coloring agents such as FD and C Red No. 3 or FD and C Blue No. 1; and pH modifiers or buffers such as carboxylic acids (including citric acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, and succinic acid), various salts of carboxylic acids, amino acids such as glycine or alanine, various phosphate, sulfate and carbonate salts such as trisodium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bisulfate, and bases such as amino glucose or triethanol amine.<br>
A preferred additive to such formulations is additional concentration-enhancing polymer which may act as a thickener or suspending agent as well as to enhance the concentration of CETP inhibitor in the environment of use and may also act to prevent or retard precipitation or crystallization of CETP inhibitor from solution.  Such preferred additives are hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose.  In particular, the salts of carboxylic acid functional polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, and carboxymethyl cellulose are useful in this regard.  Such polymers may be added in their sale forms or the salt form may be formed in  situ  during reconstitution by<br>
adding a base such as trisodium phosphate and the acid form of such polymers.<br><br>
In some cases, the overall dosage form or particles, granules or beads that make up the dosage fort may have superior performance if coated with an enteric polymer to prevent or retard dissolution until the dosage form leaves the stomach.  Exemplary enteric coating materials include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxylic acid-functionalized polymethacrylates, and carboxylic acid-functionalized polyacrylate.<br>
Compositions of this invention may be administered in a controlled release dosage form.  In one such dosage form, the composition of the CETP inhibitor and polymer is incorporated into an erodible polymeric matrix device.  By an erodible matrix is meant aqueous-erodible or water-swellable or aqueous-soluble in the sense of being either erodible or swellable or dissolvable in pure water or requiring the presence of an acid or base to ionize the polymeric matrix sufficiently to cause erosion or dissolution.  When contacted with the aqueous environment of use, the erodible polymeric matrix imbibes water and forms an aqueous-swollen gel or "matrix" that entraps the dispersion of CETP inhibitor and polymer.  The aqueous-swollen matrix gradually erodes, swells, disintegrates or dissolves in the environment of use, thereby controlling the release of the dispersion to the environment of use.  Examples of such dosage forms are disclosed more fully in commonly assigned pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/495,059 filed January 31, 2000 which claimed the benefit of priority of provisional patent application Serial No. 60/119,400 filed February 10, 1999, the relevant disclosure of_which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention may be administered by or incorporated into a non-erodible matrix device.<br><br>
Alternatively, the compositions of the invention may be delivered using a coated osmotic controlled release dosage form.  This dosage form has two components: (a) the core which contains an osmotic agent and the dispersion of CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer; and (b) a non-dissolving and non-eroding coating surrounding the core, the coating controlling the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion of some or all of the core to the environment of use.  The osmotic agent contained in the core of this device may be an aqueous-swellable hydrophilic polymer, osmogen, or osmagent.  The coating is preferably . polymeric, aqueous-permeable, and has at least one delivery port.  Examples of such dosage forms are disclosed more fully in commonly assigned pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/495,061 filed January 31, 2000 which claimed the benefit of priority of provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/119,406 filed February 10, 1999, the relevant disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions may be delivered via a coated hydrogel controlled release form having at least two components:  (a) a core comprising the dispersion of the present invention and a hydrogel, and (b) a coating through which the dispersion has passage when the dosage form is exposed to a use environment.  Examples of such dosage forms are more fully disclosed in commonly assigned European Patent EP037S404, the relevant disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the drug mixture of the invention may be delivered via a coated hydrogel controlled release dosage form having at least three components:  (a) a composition containing the dispersion, (b) a water-swellable composition wherein the water-swellable composition is in a separate region within a<br><br>
core formed by the drug-containing composition and the water-swellable composition, and (c) a coating around the core that is water-permeable, water-insoluble, and has at least one delivery port 'therethrough.  In use, the core imbibes water through the coating, swelling the water-swellable composition and increasing the pressure within the core, and fluidizing the dispersion-containing composition.  Because the coating remains intact, the dispersion-containing composition is extruded out of the delivery port into an environment of use.  Examples of such dosage forms are more fully disclosed in commonly-assigned pending Provisional Application Serial No. 60/171,968 filed December 23, 1999, the relevant disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions may be administered as multiparticulates.  Multiparticulates generally refer to dosage forms that comprise a multiplicity of particles that may range in size from about 10 μm to about 2 mm, more typically about 100 μm to 1 mm in diameter.  Such multiparticulates may be packaged, for example, in a capsule such as a gelatin capsule or a capsule formed from an aqueous-soluble polymer such as HPMCAS, HPMC or starch or they may be dosed as a suspension or slurry in a liquid.<br>
Such multiparticulates may be made by any known process, such as wet- and dry-granulation processes, extrusion/spheronization, roller-compaction, or by spray-coating seed cores.  For example, in wet- and dry-granulation processes, the composition of CETP inhibitor and concentration-enhancing polymer is prepared as described above.  This composition is then granulated to form multiparticulates, of the desired size.  Other excipients, such as a binder {e.g., microcrystalline. cellulose), may be blended with the composition to .aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates.  In the case of wet granulation, a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose may be included in the<br><br>
granulation fluid to aid in forming a suitable multiparticulate.<br>
In any case, the resulting particles may themselves constitute the multiparticulate dosage form or they may be coated by various film-forming materials such as enteric polymers or water-swellable or water-soluble polymers, or they may be combined with other excipients or vehicles to aid in dosing to patients.<br>

Other features and embodiments of the invention will become apparent from the following examples which are given for illustration of the invention rather than for limiting its intended scope.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1 This example discloses preparation of an amorphous solid dispersion of [2R,4R] 4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-2-cyclopropyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-l-carboxylic acid isopropyl ester ("Drug 1") , which has a solubility in water of less than 1 /zg/mL and a Clog P value of 7.6.  A dispersion of 10 wt% Drug 1 and 90  wt% polymer was made by mixing Drug 1 in the solvent acetone together with a "medium fine" (AQUOT~MF) grade of the cellulosic ester polymer HPMCAS (manufactured by Shin Etsu) to form a solution.  The solution comprised 0.053 wt% Drug 1, 0.4 77 wt% HPMCAS, and 99.47 wt% acetone.  The dispersion was prepared using a "mini" spray-dryer, which consisted of an atomizer in the top cap of a vertically oriented stainless steel pipe.  The atomizer was a two-fluid nozzle (Spraying Systems Co. 1650 fluid cap and 64 air cap) , where the atomizing gas was nitrogen delivered<br><br>
to the nozzle at 100DC and a flow rate of 15 gm/min, and the solution to be spray dried was delivered to the nozzle at room temperature and a flow "rate of 1.3 mL/min using a syringe pump.  Filter paper with a supporting screen was clamped to the bottom end of the pipe to-collect the solid spray-dried material and allow the nitrogen and evaporated solvent to escape.  These SDD preparation parameters are summarized in Table 1.<br>

Example 5 The spray-dried dispersions of Examples 1 to 4 were evaluated in in  vitro  dissolution tests using a<br>
microcentrifuge method.  In this method, 1 mg of the spray-dried dispersions was added to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.  The tube was  placed in a 37°C sonicating bath, and 1 mL of a model-fasted duodenal solution (MFDS) (comprising sodium taurocholate/l-palrTutoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 -phosphocholine (NaTC-POPC) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 6.5 and 290 mOsm/kg) was added.  The samples were quickly mixed using a combination of vortex mixer and sonication for about 90 seconds.  The theoretical maximum concentration ("TCmax") of drug for Examples 1-3 if all the drug dissolved was 100 /j.g/mL,   while fcr Example 4 the TCaax was 500 yug/mL.  The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 G at 37°C for 1 minute.  The resulting supernatant solution was then sampled (100 /iL) and diluted with 200 /xL methanol and then analyzed by HPLC.  The tubes were then mixed on the vortex mixer and allowed to stand undisturbed at 37°C until the next sample.  Samples were collected at 3, 10, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and for Examples 1 and 2 at 1200 minutes.  Data for Examples 1 to 4 are shown in Table 2.<br>

Example 8 The spray-dried dispersions of Examples 6 and 7 were evaluated in an in  vitro  dissolution test using a microcentrifuge method.  In this test, the spray-dried dispersion was added to a microcentrifuge tube for a Drug 2 dose of about 1000 μg/mL   (7.2 mg for Example 6, 18 mg for Example 7).  The tube was placed in a 37°C sonicating bath, and 1.8 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 6.5 and 290 mOsm/kg was added.  The samples were quickly mixed using a vortex mixer for about 60   seconds.  The samples v/ere centrifuged at 13,000 G at 37°C for 1 minute.  The resulting supernatant solution was then sampled and diluted 1:6 (by volume) with methanol and then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The contents of the tubes were mixed on the vortex mixer and allowed to stand undisturbed at 3 7°C until the next sample was taken.  Samples were collected at 4, 10, 20, 40, 90, and 1200 minutes. The concentrations of drug obtained in these samples are shown in Table 5.<br>
For Control 2, an in vitro dissolution test was<br>

Table 6<br><br>
The results summarized in Table 6 above show that the dissolution results for the compositions of Examples 6 and 7 were much better than that of the crystalline drug alone, providing CmaX.90 values that were 134-fold and 154-fold that of the crystalline drug (Control 2) , respectively, and AUC90 values that were 493-fold and 580-fold that of the crystalline drug (Control 2), respectively.  It should be noted that the non zero concentrations of Drug 2 for Control 2 may be in error and the actual values were below the detection<br><br>
limit of about 1 μg/ml.  Accurate measurements of the solubility of crystalline Drug 2 yield a value of about 0.01 /ig/ml .  Thus, the actual CmaN-90 for Drug 2 in Control 2 is believed to be about 0.01 fig/ml.      Using this value, the compositions of Examples 6 and 7 provided Cmax gQ. values that were about 80,000-fold to 92,500-fold that of the crystalline drug, and AUC90 values that were about 70,000- to 80,000-fold that of the crystalline drug, respectively.<br>
