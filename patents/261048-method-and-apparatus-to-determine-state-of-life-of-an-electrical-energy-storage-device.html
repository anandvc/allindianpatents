TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 This invention pertains generally to life expectancy estimations for an<br>
electrical energy storage device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Various systems use energy storage devices to supply electrical<br>
energy to electrical machines which are operable to provide motive torque.<br>
One such hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-<br>
split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for<br>
receiving power from a prime mover power source and an output member for<br>
delivering power from the transmission to a vehicle driveline, often in<br>
conjunction with an internal combustion engine. First and second<br>
motor/generators are operatively connected to an energy storage device for<br>
interchanging electrical power between the storage device and the first and<br>
second motor/generators. A control unit is provided for regulating the<br>
electrical power interchange between the energy storage device and the first<br>
and second motor/generators. The control unit also regulates electrical power<br>
interchange between the first and second motor/generators. One of the design considerations in vehicle powertrain systems is an<br>
ability to provide consistent vehicle performance and component/system<br>
service life. Hybrid vehicles, and more specifically the battery pack systems<br>
utilized therewith, provide vehicle system designers with new challenges and<br>
tradeoffs. It has been observed that service life of an electrical energy storage<br>
device, e.g. a battery pack system, increases as resting temperature of the<br>
battery pack decreases. However, cold operating temperature introduces<br>
limits in battery charge/discharge performance until temperature of the pack is<br>
increased. A warm battery pack is more able to supply required power to the<br><br>
vehicle propulsion system, but continued warm temperature operation may<br>
result in diminished service life.<br>
 Modern hybrid vehicle systems manage various aspects of operation<br>
of the hybrid system to effect improved service life of the battery. For<br>
example, depth of battery discharge is managed, amp-hour (A-h) throughput is<br>
limited, and convection fans are used to cool the battery pack. Ambient<br>
environmental conditions in which the vehicle is operated has largely been<br>
ignored. However, the ambient environmental conditions may have<br>
significant effect upon battery service life. Specifically, same models of<br>
hybrid vehicles released into various geographic areas throughout North<br>
America would likely not result in the same battery pack life, even if all the<br>
vehicles were driven on the same cycle. The vehicle's environment must be<br>
considered if a useful estimation of battery life is to be derived. Additionally,<br>
customer expectations, competition and government regulations impose<br>
standards of performance, including for service life of battery packs, which<br>
must be met.<br>
 End of service life of a battery pack may be indicated by ohmic<br>
resistance of the battery pack. The ohmic resistance of the battery pack is<br>
typically flat during much of the service life of the vehicle and battery pack<br>
however, thus preventing a reliable estimate of real-time state-of-life ('SOL')<br>
of the battery pack throughout most of the service life. Instead, ohmic<br>
resistance is most useful to indicate incipient end of service life of the battery<br>
pack.<br>
 Therefore, there is a need to for a method and apparatus to provide a<br>
reliable real-time state-of-life of an energy storage device for a hybrid vehicle.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 A method to determine state-of-life of an electrical energy storage<br>
device includes monitoring electrical current through the electrical energy<br>
storage device, monitoring a state-of-charge of the electrical energy storage<br>
device, monitoring temperature of the electrical energy storage device during<br>
active periods of operation, and monitoring temperature of the electrical<br>
energy storage device during quiescent periods of operation. The method<br>
further includes determining a state-of-life of the electrical energy storage<br>
device based upon the electrical current, the state-of-charge, and the<br>
temperature of the electrical energy storage device during active periods of<br>
operation and during quiescent periods of operation.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS	<br>
 The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
 Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and, Fig. 2 is an algorithmic block diagram, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 shows a control system and an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system which has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system comprises a plurality of<br>
torque-generative devices operable to supply motive torque to a transmission<br>
device, which supplies motive torque to a driveline. The torque-generative<br>
devices preferably comprise an internal combustion engine 14 and first and<br><br>
second electric machines 56, 72 operable to convert electrical energy supplied<br>
from an electrical storage device 74 to motive torque. The exemplary<br>
transmission device 10 comprises a two-mode, compound-split electro-<br>
mechanical transmission having four fixed gear ratios, and includes a plurality<br>
of gears operable to transmit the motive torque to an output shaft 64 and<br>
driveline through a plurality of torque-transfer devices contained therein.<br>
Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid<br>
Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 The control system comprises a distributed control module<br>
architecture interacting via a local area communications network to provide<br>
ongoing control to the powertrain system, including the engine 14, the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72, and the transmission 10.<br>
 The exemplary powertrain system been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The hybrid transmission 10<br>
receives input torque from torque-generative devices, including the engine 14<br>
and the electrical machines 56, 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel<br>
or electrical potential stored in electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon<br>
factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and, propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines<br>
referred to as transfer conductor 27. The TPIM 19 transfers electrical energy<br>
to the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly transfer electrical energy to the second electrical machine 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable between the electrical<br><br>
machines 56, 72 and the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor control modules configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality.<br>
 The electrical machines 56, 72 preferably comprise known<br>
motors/generator devices. In motoring control, the respective inverter<br>
receives current from the ESD and provides AC current to the respective<br>
motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the<br>
respective inverter receives AC current from the motor over the respective<br>
transfer conductor and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC<br>
current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge<br>
operating mode of the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably,<br>
machine A 56 and machine B 72 are three-phase AC electrical machines and<br>
the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power electronic devices. The elements shown in Fig. 1, and described hereinafter, comprise a<br>
subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide<br>
coordinated system control of the powertrain system described herein. The<br>
control system is operable to gather and synthesize pertinent information and<br>
inputs, and execute algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control<br>
targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and<br>
motors 56, 72. The distributed control module architecture of the control<br>
system comprises an engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control<br>
module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and the<br>
Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A hybrid control module<br>
('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br><br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Within the control system, each of the aforementioned control modules<br>
communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local<br>
area network ('LAN') communications bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. By way of example, one communications protocol is the<br>
Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
 The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the Ul 13 and the<br>
powertrain, the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: an engine<br>
torque command, clutch torque commands, for various clutches of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands, for the electrical machines A<br>
and B, respectively.<br>
 The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates an axle torque request. For<br>
simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally having bi-directional interface with<br>
engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various parameters that are sensed by ECM<br>
23 include engine coolant temperature, engine input speed to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br><br>
 The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
control signals, i.e. clutch torque commands to the clutches of the<br>
transmission.<br>
 The BPCM 21 interacts with various sensors associated with the ESD<br>
74 to derive information about the state of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. Such<br>
sensors comprise voltage and electrical current sensors, as well as ambient<br>
sensors operable to measure operating conditions of the ESD 74 including,<br>
e.g., temperature and resistance measured across terminals of the ESD 74 (not<br>
shown). Sensed parameters include ESD voltage, VBAT, ESD current, IBAT, and<br>
ESD temperature, TBAT. Derived parameters preferably include ESD internal<br>
resistance, RBAT, , ESD state-of-charge, SOC, and other states of the ESD,<br>
including available electrical power, PBAT_MiNand PBAT_MAX- The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes the<br>
aforementioned power inverters and machine control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for machines A and B based upon input from<br>
the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system<br>
operating parameters. Motor torques are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control the machines A and B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5.<br>
 Each of the aforementioned control modules of the control system is<br>
preferably a general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, read only memory (ROM), random<br>
access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br><br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
 Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
 The action described hereinafter occurs during active operation of the<br>
vehicle, i.e. that period of time when operation of the engine and electrical<br>
machines are enabled by the vehicle operator, typically through a 'key-on'<br>
action. Quiescent periods include periods of time when operation of the<br>
engine and electrical machines are disabled by the vehicle operator, typically<br>
through a 'key-off action. In response to an operator's action, as captured by<br>
the UI 13, the supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other<br>
control modules determine required transmission output torque, T0.<br>
Selectively operated components of the hybrid transmission 10 are<br>
appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator demand.<br>
For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1, when the<br>
operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the<br>
accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines how and when the<br>
vehicle is to accelerate or decelerate. The HCP 5 also monitors the parametric<br>
states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to effect a desired rate of acceleration or deceleration.<br><br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand. Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic diagram is shown,<br>
demonstrating an exemplary method for estimating a state-of-life of the ESD<br>
74 in real-time, based upon monitored inputs. The method is preferably<br>
executed as one or more algorithms in one of the control modules of the<br>
control system, typically the HCP 5. The estimated state-of-life of the ESD 74 is preferably stored as a scalar value in a non-volatile memory<br>
location for reference, updating, and for resetting, each occurring at<br>
appropriate points during life of the vehicle and the ESD 74. Overall, determining a parametric value for the SOL comprises<br>
monitoring in real-time an ESD current IBAT (in amperes), an ESD temperature<br>
TBAT, an ESD voltage VBAT, an ESD internal resistance RBAT, and ESD State-of<br>
Charge. These parameters, IBAT, TBAT, VBAT, and RBAT, are used to determine a<br>
parametric value for ESD current integrated over time 110, a parametric value<br>
for depth of discharge factor 112, a parametric value for driving temperature<br>
factor 114, and, a parametric value for resting temperature factor 116. Each of<br>
the aforementioned factors, i.e. the integrated ESD current, depth of discharge,<br>
driving temperature factor, and resting temperature factor, are combined,<br>
preferably by a summing operation, with a previously determined state-of-life<br>
factor, SOLK, to determine a parametric value for the SOL, i.e. SOLK+i, shown<br>
as an output of block 120. The algorithm to determine the state-of-life factor,<br>
SOLK, is preferably executed multiple times during each trip (defined as an<br>
engine on-off cycle).<br>
 When the operation of the engine and electrical machines are enabled<br>
by the vehicle operator, typically through a 'key-on' action and the engine is<br>
initially started, there is an initial state-of-life factor, SOLK, which is used in<br>
calculating subsequent values for SOL, and is shown as SOLSAVED 128. The<br>
SOLSAVED factor 128 is only used once during each trip, and is supplanted in<br>
future calculations during the trip by the SOLK+1 factor output from Blocks<br>
120, 122, and 124, which is shown as Block 130. Similarly, the resting<br><br>
temperature factor output from Block 116 is only used during the first<br>
execution of the algorithm to calculate SOL after the engine/vehicle is initially<br>
started or turned on, as is indicated by the INIT block 126. On subsequent<br>
executions of the algorithm to calculate SOL, the resting temperature factor is<br>
omitted from the calculation of SOL.<br>
 During each execution of the algorithm, the output of block 120, i.e.<br>
SOLK+1, is evaluated to determine whether it has reached a saturation value, as<br>
shown in block 122. The algorithm acts further to 'lock-in' or fix the<br>
parametric value for SOL when ESD internal resistance, RBAT, indicates the<br>
ESD 74 is approaching end of life, as output from block 118. In any event, the<br>
SOL value output from Block 124 is saved in a non-volatile memory device as<br>
SOLK, for use in future calculations of SOL, as indicated by Block 130. This<br>
operation is described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
 Calculating ESD state-of-charge ('SOC'), including depth-of-<br>
discharge ('DOD'), comprises monitoring ESD temperature during active and<br>
quiescent periods of ESD operation. Quiescent periods of ESD operation are<br>
characterized by ESD power flow that is de minimus whereas active periods of<br>
ESD operation are characterized by ESD power flow that is not de minimus.<br>
That is to say, quiescent periods of ESD operation are generally characterized<br>
by no or minimal current flow into or out of the ESD. With respect to an ESD<br>
associated with a hybrid vehicle propulsion system for example, quiescent<br>
periods of ESD operation may be associated with periods of vehicle inactivity<br>
(e.g. powertrain, including electric machines, is inoperative such as during<br>
periods when the vehicle is not being driven and accessory loads are off but<br>
may include such periods characterized by parasitic current draws as are<br>
required for continuing certain controller operations including, for example,<br>
the operations associated with the present invention). Active periods of ESD<br>
operation in contrast may be associated with periods of vehicle activity (e.g.<br>
accessory loads are on and/or the powertrain, including electric machines, is<br>
operative such as during periods when the vehicle is being driven wherein<br>
current flows may be into or out of the ESD).<br><br>
 The SOLK factor used during initial execution of the algorithm after<br>
engine start up, and shown as the SOLSAVED factor 128 in Fig. 2 is derived as<br>
follows. Upon initial start of a vehicle at a vehicle assembly plant a<br>
parametric value for SOLK is initialized to a baseline value, in this<br>
embodiment equal to zero. The value for SOLK may also be set to zero upon<br>
replacement of the ESD 74. The SOLK factor may be reduced to a non-zero<br>
value, i.e. above the baseline value, under certain identifiable circumstances<br>
that may occur during vehicle service. In this instance, calibrations may be<br>
used that allow a member of the service community to offset an existing SOLK<br>
factor. Such identifiable circumstances include: partial replacement of<br>
modules within the ESD 74; refreshing of the ESD 74 using known methods<br>
for increasing ESD operating life; replacing the ESD with a known system<br>
having a known SOLK factor. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, the magnitude<br>
of the SOLK factor may be reduced by the SOL resting temperature factor<br>
when the ESD experiences resting temperatures that are lower than a<br>
calibrated value during a quiescent period between adjacent engine operating<br>
periods.<br>
 The DOD factor output from Block 112 preferably comprises a well-<br>
known and determinable value in the control system for each ESD 74. Each<br>
parametric value for DOD comprises a measure of quantity of 100% DOD<br>
cycles, i.e. the quantity of times an individual ESD is 100% discharged. For<br>
example, a typical Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMh) battery system for a hybrid<br>
vehicle is known to fail after 700 100%-DOD cycles. As magnitude of<br>
discharge (measured in %-DOD) decreases, life expectancy and performance<br>
of the ESD is known to improve exponentially. For illustrative purposes, the<br>
range of parametric values for the SOL factor is within the same order of<br>
magnitude as the DOD factor, i.e., 0 to 1000 units. The SOL factor is<br>
preferably of sufficient resolution to capture the effect of each and every drive<br>
cycle as well as significant resting or quiescent periods.<br>
 Determination of a parametric value for the depth of discharge<br>
(DOD) factor is preferably determined during vehicle operation. The DOD<br><br>
factor comprehends and incorporates all DOD events that are greater than a<br>
calibratable value, e.g. 0.5% of total ESD capacity. A DOD event comprises a<br>
cycle of ESD discharge and subsequent charge to an original state of charge.<br>
The DOD factor of this embodiment is set at a value of 0.5% for each 100%-<br>
DOD event, and scaled accordingly for other DOD events less than 100%-<br>
DOD. Calculation of a parametric value for the DOD factor includes using the<br>
actual state of charge, SOC, as an input value. Determination of SOC is<br>
known, and not discussed herein.<br>
 The DOD factor 112 includes calculating effects of extended resting<br>
periods on SOL of the ESD. Known ESD systems used on vehicles and<br>
other applications have determinable self-discharge rates. A typical known<br>
self-discharge rate is 0.5%) per day, and is adjustable based upon device<br>
temperature, i.e. TBAT- Higher temperatures typically result in a higher self-<br>
discharge rate. The invention determines ESD SOC at vehicle shutdown and<br>
recalculates SOC at a subsequent start of operation to determine the DOD<br>
factor as output from 112, reflecting the self-discharge rate. The resultant<br>
DOD Factor output from block 112 is used in the SOL calculation, shown at<br>
120.<br>
 By way of example, a parametric value for the DOD factor 112 is<br>
determined thusly. A vehicle operator having a newly manufactured hybrid<br>
vehicle with a new ESD neglects to put fuel in the vehicle, completely<br>
discharges the ESD 74 from 100%) to 0 %&gt;. The DOD Factor Monitor passes a<br>
value of 1, which is added to the existing SOL of 0, with a resultant SOL of<br>
approximately 1. The SOL factor would likely be slightly larger, because of<br>
the other calculated contributions to SOL factor.<br>
 By way of example the feature related to extended resting or<br>
quiescence, a parametric value for the DOD factor 112 is determined thusly.<br>
A vehicle operator arrives at an airport and shuts down a hybrid vehicle<br>
system currently having a 70%&gt; SOC. When the customer returns and starts<br>
the vehicle, the DOD Factor monitor detects a 60% SOC. The DOD Factor<br>
monitor adds a value of 0.2%&gt; to calculation of the SOL, which is obtained<br><br>
through an in-control module calibration table comprising a %DOD as a<br>
function of life derived from vehicle testing.<br>
 Monitoring current of the ESD preferably comprises measuring and<br>
integrating, as a function of time, the magnitude of the electrical current, IBAT,<br>
during each active charging and discharging event. The Ampere-hour (A-h)<br>
monitor 110, typically executed during vehicle operation, comprises a measure<br>
of cumulative quantity of electrical energy passed through the ESD 74. The<br>
standard method for tracking use of an energy storage device is typically<br>
through A-h/mile calculations, using IBAT , elapsed time, and vehicle miles<br>
driven as input parameters. Preproduction testing of a specifically designed<br>
ESD yields a typical amount of average A-h/mile required to meet life<br>
expectancy targets for the ESD 74. The exemplary A-h monitor calculates a<br>
contribution to SOL 120 in real-time. The A-h contribution may pass data in<br>
real-time to update the SOL, or, alternatively, update the SOL at the end of<br>
each driving cycle. Use of the A-h/mile method of tracking ESD usage<br>
makes the SOL determination 120 robust to extended periods of vehicle<br>
resting at zero speed, and adjusts the A-h/mile parameter before its<br>
contribution to calculation of the SOL.<br>
 By way of example, a parametric value for the A-h monitor 110 is<br>
determined thusly. An operator has a hybrid vehicle with 50,000 miles and an<br>
ESD with an existing SOL factor of 195.987. The vehicle is driven to work,<br>
wherein the cumulative calculated A-h/mile value is 6.52 A-h/mile. The<br>
monitor maps this calculation, using a precalibrated lookup table, and<br>
determines the A-h monitor factor to be .003. The A-h monitor factor is added<br>
to the SOL, thus becoming 195.990.<br>
 By way of another example, a parametric value for the A-h monitor<br>
110 is determined thusly with the following exception. An operator operates<br>
an exemplary vehicle at idle, with the hybrid system cycling between an<br>
internal combustion engine-on mode and a ESD-only mode. The A-h monitor<br>
calculates a first value, e.g. 32 A-h/mile, and corrects the first value by the<br>
percentage of total time the vehicle was operated at zero speed.<br><br>
 Determining a parametric value for the resting temperature factor,<br>
shown at 116, comprises monitoring temperature of the ESD during a<br>
quiescent period, or resting temperature monitoring, referred to as TREST. The<br>
resting temperature factor is preferably determined at engine/vehicle startup,<br>
and is only used to calculate SOLK+1 at the first occurrence of execution of the<br>
SOL algorithm during each engine-on cycle, as indicated by block 126. On<br>
subsequent calculations of SOL during each engine-on cycle, the resting<br>
temperature factor is omitted from the calculation. An exemplary method<br>
and apparatus for determining ESD temperature during a quiescent period,<br>
when the vehicle is not operating, are disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. /	, Attorney Docket No. GP-307585,<br>
entitled "Method and Apparatus for Quantifying Quiescent Period<br>
Temperature Effects upon an Electric Energy Storage Device", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 Another contribution to ESD service life comprises the conditions the<br>
ESD experiences during each quiescent, or resting, period. The invention<br>
determines resting average resting temperature of the ESD based upon input<br>
parameter TBAT, and applies a bias value to the SOL each time the<br>
vehicle/engine undergoes a startup, based thereon. Because ESD life data is<br>
typically determined at a temperature around 25 C, a zero bias is applied for<br>
resting temperatures at that level. The bias value is exponentially applied fol-<br>
lower and higher resting temperatures. In some applications, because of<br>
difficulty in properly estimating resting temperature of vehicles over multiple<br>
subsequent days, the algorithm may include larger zero bias areas at and near<br>
temperatures around 25 C while disabling inputs for this monitor, such as<br>
length of resting time.<br>
 Determining a parametric value for the driving temperature factor<br>
TDRIVE which is output from block 114 comprises monitoring ESD temperature,<br>
TBAT during vehicle operation, and is preferably executed in real-time. While<br>
operating the vehicle, a small component of the SOL is calculated using a<br>
running average temperature calculation, based upon the ESD temperature<br><br>
input parameter, TBAT. This is similar to the application of the resting<br>
temperature monitor, however it is much smaller in magnitude, and in the<br>
current application is executed at a slower calculation rate than the base<br>
process.<br>
 The end-of-life resistance monitor which is output from Block 118,<br>
comprises monitoring resistance, RBAT of the ESD. Calculation of resistance of<br>
the ESD, RBAT, is preferably derived from a measure of ESD current IBAT, and<br>
ESD voltage, VBAT. Near end-of-service life of a typical ESD, there is a<br>
characteristic 'knee' in the measured resistance curve, as shown at 119, which<br>
is readily determinable by an algorithm which monitors RBAT over time,<br>
preferably executed the control system. The resistance of the ESD calculated<br>
throughout its life typically lacks useable information, because it is relatively<br>
flat and depends upon temperature. However, at a point near end-of-life, the<br>
magnitude of the resistance, RBAT, is known to change in an uncharacteristic<br>
manner in a relatively short length of time. The change is resistance is<br>
detectable by monitoring resistance over time, and when the resistance value<br>
changes by an amount greater than a minimum amount, as shown at 118, a<br>
software flag is set, and operation of the algorithm is altered by locking in or<br>
fixing the parametric value for SOL, as shown at 124.<br>
 Detection of the characteristic 'knee' provides information to the<br>
vehicle control system which permits improved prediction of end-of-service<br>
life (EOL) of the ESD, and gives sufficient time for the control system to<br>
adjust control of the vehicle, especially control of the engine 14 and electrical<br>
machines 56, 72, when necessary. A typical action by the control system in<br>
response to the software flag being set as a result in the change in ESD<br>
performance can include reduction in electrical power limit levels to machines<br>
56, 72 to extend service life of the ESD, thus permitting a longer timeframe to<br>
repair/replace the ESD. This becomes important at lower ambient<br>
temperatures when the ESD comprises the sole electrical energy source for<br>
start of the engine 14. The exemplary resistance-monitoring algorithm<br>
monitors the resistance of the ESD, and, upon detection of the 'knee' clamps<br><br>
the determined SOL value to a known value that is recognizable by the control<br>
system to indicate approaching, or imminent, end of service life of the ESD,<br>
which is the action that occurs at Block 124. This value is referred to herein<br>
as "SOL factor lock-in".<br>
 In operation, when a parametric value for the SOL value reaches<br>
below 100% and below the "SOL factor lock-in" (e.g., 95%), and before<br>
achieving the resistance threshold indicating end of service life, it saturates at<br>
a known value (e.g. 90%) 122. This provides the control system a clear<br>
indication that end of service life of the ESD 74 is being approached, while<br>
indicating the remaining service life of the ESD is unknown.<br>
 The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
