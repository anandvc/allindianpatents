				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing silicate-containing<br>
fiber according to the preamble of the appended claim 1.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Materials that are not easily burned or are non-combustible are<br>
increasingly used in the production of furniture and textiles. For<br>
example, in upholstery materials, such as fabrics, fibers that do not<br>
catch fire easily, or are non-flammable, and prevent fire are used. This<br>
kind of fibers include, inter alia, silicate-containing fibers.<br>
One manner to manufacture silicate-containing fibers is to adapt<br>
viscose manufactured of cellulose by adding silicon dioxide to it and by<br>
spinning and processing the thus created silicate-containing fiber for<br>
further use. This kind of a method is presented, for example, in the GB<br>
patent 1064271, where the viscose-containing sodium silicate is spun<br>
into an acidic spinning solution, where the regeneration of the viscose<br>
into cellulose takes place, and at the same time, the sodium silicate in<br>
the viscose precipitates into silicon acid, which is water-containing<br>
silicon dioxide evenly distributed throughout the cellulose.<br>
The method according to the above-mentioned patent is an<br>
inexpensive manner to manufacture silicate-containing fibers. The<br>
problem is that the silicon acid in the fibers formed by this method does<br>
not endure the alkaline detergents used in washing of textiles. In<br>
repeated washes, the silicon acid contained by the fibers dissolves into<br>
the alkaline washing liquid, which leads into a decreased fire durability.<br>
The above-mentioned problem is solved in the Fl patent 91778<br>
(corresponds to US 5,417,752) by processing the spun silicate-<br>
containing viscose fiber with sodium aluminate, wherein the silicon<br>
dioxide that is in silicon acid form in the silicate reacts with the<br><br>
aluminate and forms aluminum silicate groups in the silicon acid. The<br>
solubility of the aluminum silicate groups-containing silicon acid to<br>
alkaline detergents is very small, and therefore the product can be<br>
washed with normal detergents without its fire prevention properties<br>
being altered. In addition, the product containing aluminum silicate<br>
groups has a significantly better fire protection efficiency than products<br>
manufactured without aluminate.<br>
The problem with the methods according to both of the above-<br>
mentioned publications is, however, the tendency of the silicate<br>
contained by the viscose, i.e. the silicon acid or silica (SiO2.nH2O) to<br>
dissolve into the spinning solution in spinning. It has been detected that<br>
a significant part of the silicate, even hundreds of milligrams/liter of<br>
spinning solution, may remain in the spinning solution in spinning. The<br>
uncontrolled dissolution of silicate and dispersion into the spinning<br>
solution causes several problems. The silicate forms precipitate in the<br>
spinning bath, which causes fouling of the spinning bath and increases<br>
friction between the tow consisting of thousands of fibers that is formed<br>
in the spinning bath and, and the stretch rolls, i.e. galets and stretch<br>
stones. Friction between individual fibers also increases in the tow,<br>
which weakens the stretchability of the tow and thus also the strength<br>
of an individual fiber. The friction between fibers also causes fibers to<br>
fray at the spinner.<br>
The uncontrolled dissolution of silicate from the fibers into the spinning<br>
solution also causes quality fluctuations in them. This can be seen as<br>
fluctuations in the strength values and titer, i.e. the weight/length<br>
values of the fiber, which deteriorates the textile properties of the fiber.<br>
In addition, a decrease in the amount of silicate in a fiber leads to a<br>
weakened fire durability of the finished fiber, because even only a<br>
decrease of 1 to 2 % in the amount of silicate deteriorates fire<br>
protection significantly.<br><br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
Therefore, the purpose of the present invention is to provide an<br>
improved method for manufacturing silicate-containing fiber, which<br>
avoids the above-mentioned problems and where the fiber<br>
manufactured according to the method has as high as possible silicate<br>
concentration.<br>
To attain this purpose, the method according to the invention is<br>
primarily characterized in what will be presented in the characterizing<br>
part of the independent main claim 1.<br>
The other, dependent claims will present some preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that the composition of the<br>
regeneration solution used in manufacturing silicate-containing fiber,<br>
i.e. the spinning solution used as spinning bath is formed into such that<br>
the silicate concentration of the fiber being manufactured can be kept<br>
as high as possible. This can be implemented by means of the method<br>
according to the invention, which utilizes the surprising observation that<br>
by adding a suitable amount of soluble silicate in a controlled manner<br>
into the spinning solution, the solubility of the silicate in the fibers to the<br>
spinning solution decreases. Thus, the amount of silicate contained by<br>
the viscose fiber can be kept as high as possible.<br>
In the silicate-containing fibers formed in the spinning bath the silicate<br>
is evenly distributed in the fiber. The silicate on the outer surface of the<br>
fibers, however, comes into contact with the spinning solution during<br>
the spinning of fibers and dissolves into the spinning solution and<br>
crystallizes into it. This crystallization is completely uncontrolled and<br>
causes the above-described problems. By adding soluble silicate<br>
according to the invention to the spinning solution, the uncontrolled<br>
dissolution and crystallization of the silicate on the surface of the fibers<br>
can be prevented.<br><br>
The silicate added to the spinning bath can be water-soluble alkali<br>
metal silicate, such as sodium silicate, for example, water glass<br>
(Na2OnSiO2) or water-soluble precipitated silicate. The silicate<br>
concentration of the spinning bath can vary between 50 and 1,000 mg/l<br>
of spinning solution, advantageously it is between 100 and 700 mg/l of<br>
spinning solution. The silicate is added directly to the spinning bath,<br>
among the other chemicals forming the spinning solution. The spinning<br>
solution is continuously recirculated between the processes of the<br>
spinning bath and the spinning solution during spinning.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
spinning solution is kept saturated or nearly saturated by the soluble<br>
silicate by removing or adding silicate in a controlled manner to the<br>
spinning bath. The extra silicate precipitated in the spinning bath can<br>
be removed by means of any filtering method known as such, for<br>
example, by sand filtration, pressure filtration or a curved screen.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, in the<br>
manufacturing process of silicate-containing fiber, silicate-containing<br>
solutions are used also in the stretching and washing stages of the<br>
fiber, which follow the spinning stage.<br>
Further, according to a third embodiment of the invention, the silicate<br>
concentration of the silicate-containing fiber can be controlled onto a<br>
desired level by controlling the amount of silicate added to the spinning<br>
solution.<br>
By means of the method, the uncontrolled dissolution of silicate from<br>
the silicate-containing fiber into the spinning solution can be eliminated<br>
and the problems caused by the friction between the fibers caused by<br>
the silicate powder precipitating in the spinning bath can be removed.<br>
As a result of that, the fluctuations in the quality properties of the fibers<br>
also decrease. The deviations of the strength and titer values<br>
measured of the fibers are smaller than that of the fibers manufactured<br>
by means of the methods according to prior art, which improves their<br>
textile properties. In addition, the increase in the amount of silicate<br><br>
contained by the fibers improves the fire protection properties of the<br>
fibers significantly.<br>
By means of the method it is also possible to produce viscose fibers<br>
whose silicate concentration has been controlled onto a specific level<br>
according to the desires of the customer.<br>
Application of the method is easy and simple and it is easy to apply to<br>
the already existing plants manufacturing silicate-containing fiber.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
In the following, the invention is described more in detail with reference<br>
to the appended figure, which schematically shows the method for<br>
manufacturing silicate-containing fiber according to the invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The figure shows a manufacturing method for viscose fiber, wherein in<br>
stage 1, the dissolving cellulose processed by means of sodium<br>
hydroxide (NaOH) is sludged into slush pulp. After this, the cellulose is<br>
pressed in stage 2 for removing the sodium hydroxide from it, and the<br>
resulting alkali cellulose is shredded in stage 3. The shredded alkali<br>
cellulose is directed to stage 4, i.e. prematuring, where it stays under<br>
the effect of the oxygen in air for about 3 to 5 hours in a temperature of<br>
approximately 35 to 45 °C. In prematuring, the alkali cellulose is partly<br>
depolymerized.<br>
Next, the prematured alkali cellulose is directed to sulphurization (stage<br>
5), where carbon bisulphide (CS2) is mixed into the alkali cellulose, in<br>
which case cellulose xanthate is formed. After the sulphurization, weak<br>
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added in stage 6 to the xanthate while<br>
mixing at the same time, which leads to dissolution of xanthate, which<br>
is almost complete after 1 hour of dissolution. The orange-yellow,<br>
syrupy viscose received from stage 6 is directed through the ageing<br>
tanks of stage 7.<br><br>
During the ageing and after that in stage 8, the viscose is filtered. The<br>
next process stage 9 is deaeration. Before deaeration, for example at<br>
the point marked with the arrow 10, silicon dioxide solution is added to<br>
the viscose resulting in a mixed viscose formed by viscose and silicon<br>
dioxide. If desired, the silcon dioxide can also be added in an earlier<br>
process stage, i.e. in any suitable process stage/point before the<br>
spinning bath. The silicon dioxide added to the viscose can be, for<br>
example, commercial silicon dioxide, such as water glass (Na2O<br>
nSiO2) or a mixture of silicon dioxide and sodium hydroxide. In the<br>
deaeration stage 9 the air and gas bubbles are removed from the<br>
viscose/silicon dioxide -mixture viscose.<br>
Next, the mixed viscose is directed to the spinning stage 11, where the<br>
formation of viscose fibers takes place. The mixed viscose is directed<br>
to the spinning bath, below the surface of the spinning solution, through<br>
the small-perforation nozzles, spinnerettes of the spinning candle.<br>
There are generally about 8,000 to 50,000 holes in the spinnerettes,<br>
whose diameter is between 50 and 80 urn. The spinning solution is<br>
acidic liquor, which typically contains sulphuric acid (H2SO4), zinc<br>
sulphate (ZnSO4) and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4). The sodium sulphate<br>
is formed in the solution when the sulphuric acid contained by the<br>
solution and the sodium hydroxide in the mixed viscose react. The<br>
temperature of the spinning solution is approximately 0 to 100 °C,<br>
typically approximately 40 to 70 °C. According to the invention, soluble<br>
silicate, for example, sodium silicate, is also added to the spinning<br>
solution, which results in that the silicate in the viscose/silicon dioxide -<br>
fiber forming in the spinning bath does not dissolve into the spinning<br>
bath, but remains in the fiber. The ratio of the components contained<br>
by the spinning solution may vary in the following way:<br>
sulphuric acid 40 to 150g/l of spinning solution<br>
sodium sulphate 20 to 40 wt-%<br>
zinc sulphate 0 to 100 g/l of spinning solution<br>
sodium silicate 50 to 1,000 mg/l of spinning solution,<br>
advantageously 100 to 700 mg/l,<br>
calculated as SiO2<br><br>
The composition of the spinning bath varies depending on the quality<br>
targets and properties of the fiber being manufactured, for example its<br>
thickness.<br>
Silicate is added in a controlled manner into the spinning bath, i.e. in<br>
the manner that the silicate concentration of the fiber being spun<br>
remains as high as possible, but the properties of the spinning solution<br>
and the silicate precipitating in it do not cause problems in spinning and<br>
in the operation of the spinning apparatus. Thus, silicate can be added<br>
to the bath in suitable portions continuously or at set intervals. The<br>
silicate precipitated in the spinning bath is removed in a controlled<br>
manner as well, depending on the amount of the precipitated silicate.<br>
The solid cellulose-filament fibers forming in the spinning bath are<br>
collected from the bath in such a manner that the tow formed by the<br>
thousands of fibers coming from one spinnerette is in stage 12 wound<br>
around smaller stretch rolls first, and then further via a stretch bath to<br>
other, bigger stretch rolls, i.e. stretch stones. The stretch not only<br>
lengthens the fibers 50 to 100%, but also increases their strength. After<br>
the stretch the tow formed of the fibers is directed to the cutting stage<br>
13 where it is cut into a desired length. The cut fibers are rinsed with<br>
water to the washing stage 14. Thus, the fiber bundles break up and<br>
the washing of individual fibers can be continued in stage 14.<br>
In the drawing and washing stages it is possible to also use silicate-<br>
containing solutions, which assists in keeping the silicate concentration<br>
in the fibers as high as possible.<br>
In the washing stage 14 it is also possible, if desired, to treat the fibers<br>
with some aluminum containing solution, such as, for example, sodium<br>
aluminate solution (NaAIO2). As a result of this, the silicon acid<br>
contained by the fibers is modified into aluminum silicate, which results<br>
in a fiber that endures washing and even bleaching chemicals well,<br>
which, however, feels the same as a normal viscose fiber.<br><br>
After the possible sodium aluminate processing, the fibers are<br>
processed further in stage 14 in a normal manner, i.e. they are<br>
washed, the pH is adjusted and they are processed with surface-active<br>
agents. After this the fibers are dried.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the amount of silicate<br>
added to the spinning bath is such that the bath is saturated in relation<br>
to dissoluble silicate, or almost saturated. The extra silicate precipitated<br>
in the spinning bath is removed in connection with the circulation of the<br>
spinning solution.<br>
The devices use in the above-described manufacture of viscose fiber<br>
and their operation are known as such to a man skilled in the art, which<br>
is why they are not described more in detail here.<br>
In the following, some test results of the method according to the<br>
invention for manufacturing silicate-containing fiber will be presented.<br>
In the test, the silicate concentration of the spinning solution was varied<br>
and at the same time the silicate concentration of the viscose fibers<br>
resulting from the spinning was monitored.<br>
Test arrangements:<br>
The viscose was manufactured by means of the viscose method<br>
described above and known as such, wherein sodium silicate, i.e.<br>
water glass, was added to the viscose as silicon dioxide. Thus, the<br>
result was a mixed viscose containing 3.6 % of SiO2, 8.2 % of alpha-<br>
cellulose, and 7.4 % of NaOH. 3.5 dtex of fiber was spun of this mixed<br>
viscose. The temperature of the spinning solution was 50 °C and its<br>
composition without the silicate addition was as follows:<br>
sulphuric acid	65 g/l of spinning solution<br>
sodium sulphate 20 wt-%<br>
zinc sulphate	45 g/l of spinning solution<br>
A certain amount of silicate was added into the spinning bath at set<br>
intervals in such a manner that the silicate concentration of the<br><br>
spinning solution increased gradually. Commercially available water<br>
glass (SiO2:Na2O 2,5:1, 30,9% SiO2) was used as the added silicate.<br>
After each addition, fibers were spun to the solution in the manner<br>
presented above. After the spinning bath the fiber was stretched 90%<br>
longer than original in the stretching bath, in which the temperature<br>
was 90 °C and which contained 3g/l of sulphuric acid.<br>
The silicon dioxide content of the spinning solution was determined by<br>
a spectraphotometer by using the so-called molybdenum sine method.<br>
Before the determination the spinning solution was circulated for about<br>
and hour in order for the acid balance to normalize.<br>
The effect of the silicate additions on the silicate concentration of tie<br>
viscose fibers resulting from the spinning was monitored by analyzing<br>
the SiO2-content of the spun fibers after each silicate addition. The<br>
Sip2-content of the fibers was determined by ashing the fiber in the<br>
furnace in 750 °C for an hour and by weighing the resulting ash. The<br>
silicon dioxide in the fibers was found to be almost pure SiO2.<br>
The following table presents the effect of the silicate concentration of<br>
the spinning bath on the SiO2-concentration of the fiber:<br>
Table 1. The amount of silicate added to the spinning bath, the<br>
measured silicate concentration of the bath, and the SiO2-concentration<br>
of the fibers spun to the bath in question<br><br><br>
From the results of Table 1 it is detected that the addition of silicate to<br>
the spinning bath increases the silicate concentration of the fibers<br>
received as a result of spinning, i.e. the dissolution of the silicate in the<br>
fibers into the spinning bath is decreased. The saturation point of the<br>
solution in relation to silicate was reached in test 4. The larger silicate<br>
additions after that to the spinning bath did not have an effect on the<br>
silicate concentration of the fiber any more, but it remained constant.<br>
In addition, when fibers are compared, of which one was spun to the<br>
spinning solution that was saturated with silicate (test 4) and the other<br>
to a solution to which was added very little or no silicate (tests 1 and 2),<br>
it is noticed that without the silicate addition, an approximately 8%<br>
weight loss took place in the fiber in the spinning, i.e. the dissolution of<br>
the silicate from the fibers into the spinning solution was significant.<br>
This has an effect on the fire protection properties of the fiber. In fact,<br>
the fibers produced in tests 1 and 2 are inadequate in their fire<br>
protection properties and the unanticipated weight loss impedes the<br>
control of the fiber dtex (weight/length). By keeping the silicate<br>
concentration of the spinning bath on a suitable level, these problems<br>
can be removed.<br><br>
A part of the fibers manufactured in the above-presented tests (tests 1<br>
to 7) were also processed with aluminate. Processing with sodium<br>
aluminate solution (3 g/l of Na aluminate calculated as AI2O3, solution<br>
ratio 1:10, temperature 50 °C) increased the ash content of the fiber 2<br>
to 2.5% of the values presented in Table 1. Thus, the ash also<br>
contained aluminum.<br>
The invention is not intended to be limited to the above embodiments<br>
presented as an example, but the invention is intended to be applied<br>
widely within the scope of the inventive idea as defined in the<br>
