				<td>ELECTRONIC DEVICE WITH THREE MOVABLE LAYERS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] The disclosed embodiments relate to portable electronic devices, and more<br>
particularly, to devices and methods for controlling relative movement between layers<br>
of an electronic device.<br>
[0002] Portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, pagers, handheld<br>
computers, personal digital assistants ("PDA's") and hand-held gaming devices are<br>
becoming increasingly popular for both business and personal use. One advantage of<br>
these devices is their portability due to their small size, light weight, battery-powered or<br>
cordless operation and, in some cases, their wireless communications ability. These<br>
features allow these portable electronic devices to be utilized whenever and wherever a<br>
user desires.<br>
[0003] Because of the increasing popularity of these devices, however, it is -not<br>
uncommon for a single user to carry with them more than one of these devices at one<br>
time. For example, a user may have a mobile phone and two-way pager strapped to<br>
their belt, while carrying a PDA in a pocket and a gaming device in their bag. As such,<br>
having separate devices perform each service or function creates a problem for a user<br>
who requires more than one or two services/functions offered by these portable devices.<br>
[0004] Designers have realized this problem of device proliferation, and resultingly<br>
have tried to combine a number of services or functionalities into a single device, hi<br>
this manner, a user may only require a single device having a number of operational<br>
modes that correspond to a number of the desired services or functions. One drawback<br>
of incorporating many operational modes into a single device, however, is that each<br>
service or function typically has an established configuration, including the overall<br>
shape and the number and specific types of components. For example, a mobile phone<br>
generally includes a phone keypad consisting of 12 keys: 1 key each for the numbers 0-<br>
9, and a separate key for the "*" and "#" characters. Further, a mobile phone is<br>
generally oriented for use with its length extending in a vertical axis such that its display<br>
unit is positioned above the keypad and such that the alphanumeric or graphical output<br>
of the display can be read by a user in this orientation. In contrast, a two-way pager<br>
typically includes an alphanumeric keyboard, such as a QWERTY keyboard that may<br>
include twice as many keys as a phone keypad. Further, a two-way pager typically has<br>
a display with a width greater than a length as viewed during use. In attempting to<br>
combine services/functionalities, a designer needs surface area onto which these<br>
established orientations and sets of components may be mounted. This increased<br>
demand for surface area competes with an overall goal of maintaining a device having a<br>
compact and portable size.<br>
[0005] The copending patent application serial no. 10/718,125, entitled "A Portable<br>
Device With Versatile Keyboard," Attorney Docket No. 040101, filed November 19,<br>
2003, addresses the problem of combining several configurations by creating a device<br>
having a number of functional layers. In such a device, each layer may have a first or<br>
neutral position in which it overlaps with the other layers to form a compact electronic<br>
device. Additionally, each layer may have a second position where a specific<br>
functionality associated with that layer is actuated, thereby creating additional<br>
operational modes.<br>
[0006] One issue with such portable devices having multiple layers of functional<br>
components is that it may be possible to actuate more than one layer at one tune.1 -The<br>
resulting actuation of more than one operational mode may cause confusion for the user,<br>
and may create operational problems within the electronic device.<br>
[0007] Thus, portable electronic devices having multiple layers of functional<br>
components are desired which provide for a discrete actuation between predetermined<br>
operational modes.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0008] In accordance with one aspect, the disclosed embodiments provide a system<br>
and method for controlling relative movement between layers of an electronic device.<br>
[0009] hi one embodiment, an electronic device comprises a first component layer<br>
movable in a first direction, a second component layer movably connected relative to<br>
the first component layer, and a third component layer movably connected relative to<br>
the second component layer and movable in a second direction. The electronic device<br>
further includes a limiting member movable at least between a first position and a<br>
second position, the limiting member engageable with the second component layer and<br>
the third component layer in the first position to prevent relative movement in the<br>
second direction during movement of the first component layer in the first direction.<br>
[0010] hi another embodiment, an electronic device, comprises a first component<br>
layer movable in a first direction and having a first limiting member, a second<br>
component layer movably connected relative to the first component layer, and a third<br>
component layer movably connected relative to the second component layer and<br>
movable in a second direction. The electronic device further includes a second limiting<br>
member movably connected to the second component layer and having a first<br>
displacement surface at a first end. The second limiting member is movable between a<br>
first position and a second position, wherein the first limiting member is contactable<br>
with the first displacement surface during at least a portion of a movement of the first<br>
component layer in the first direction to move the second limiting member into the first<br>
position. Further, the second limiting member is engageable with the third component<br>
layer to substantially prevent relative movement in the second direction.<br>
[0011] In yet another embodiment, an electronic device comprises a first component<br>
layer movable in a first direction, a second component layer movably connected relative<br>
to the first component layer, and a third component layer movably connected relative to<br>
the second component layer and movable in a second direction. The electronic device<br>
further includes a movably connected means for substantially preventing relative<br>
movement between at least one of the second component layer and the third component<br>
layer during movement of the first component layer in the first direction and the second<br>
component layer and the first component layer in the second direction during movement<br>
of the third component layer in the second direction.<br>
[0012] In a further embodiment, a method of controlling relative movement between<br>
movable layers of an electronic device comprises movably connecting a first module<br>
layer to a second module layer having a first functional component such that a relative<br>
movement of the first module layer in a first direction exposes the first functional<br>
component. The method further includes movably connecting the second module layer<br>
to a third module layer having a second functional component such that a relative<br>
movement of the third module layer in a second direction exposes the second functional<br>
component. Additionally, the method includes movably positioning a first limiting<br>
member to prevent movement of the third module layer in the second direction during<br>
movement of the first module layer in the first direction.<br>
[0013] In an additional embodiment, a method for controlling actuation of operational<br>
modes of an electronic device comprises a step for exposing a first set of functional<br>
components on a second module layer movably connected to a first module layer, where<br>
the first set of functional components is associated with a first operational mode of the<br>
electronic device. The method also includes a step for exposing a second set of<br>
functional components on a third module layer movably connected to the second<br>
module layer, where the second set of functional components is associated with a<br>
second operational mode of the electronic device. And, the method further includes a<br>
step for movably positioning a limiting member to prevent exposure of one of the first<br>
set of functional components and the second set of functional components during<br>
exposure of the other one of the first set of functional components and the second set of<br>
functional components.<br>
[0014] Additional aspects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments are set forth<br>
in part in the description which follows, and in part are obvious from the description, or<br>
may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The aspects and advantages<br>
of the disclosed embodiments may also be realized and attained by the means of the<br>
instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0037] The disclosed embodiments include devices and methods for controlling<br>
relative movement between layers of an electronic device.<br>
[0038] Referring to Figs. 1-12, in one embodiment, a layer locking system 10 (Figs. 1-<br>
9) controls relative movement of portions of electronic device 12, which has a number<br>
of rnovably interconnected module layers 14, 16, 18 that provide electronic device 12<br>
with a number of functional capabilities. In one embodiment, for example referring to<br>
Figs. 1-3 and 10, electronic device 12 may have a first operational mode, such as a<br>
gaming mode, when module layers 14, 16, 18 are positioned in a first or neutral position<br>
where a first set of components 20 (Fig. 10) such as a display unit 22 and directional<br>
keypads 24, 26 on the exterior of electronic device 12 may be utilized. Referring to<br>
Figs. 4-6 and 11, electronic device 12 may have a second operational mode, such as a<br>
phone or audio communications mode, when first module layer 14 is moved in a first<br>
direction 28 relative to second and third module layers 16, 18 to expose a first additional<br>
set of components 30 (Fig. 11), such as a phone keypad 31 and microphone 32, on<br>
second module layer 16. Further, referring to Figs. 7-9 and 12, electronic device 12<br>
may have a third operational mode, such as a pager or text communications mode, when<br>
third module layer 18 is moved in a second direction 34 relative to first and second<br>
module layers 14, 16 to expose a second additional set of functional components 36<br>
(Fig. 12), such as a QWERTY keyboard 38, on third module layer 18. Locking system<br>
10 interacts with each module layer 14, 16, 18 to enable a discrete actuation of a single<br>
operational mode by limiting predetermined relative movements between module layers<br>
14, 16, 18 during actuation. In other words, locking system 10 allows predetermined<br>
relative movement of module layers 14, 16, 18 in a direction associated with the<br>
selected operational mode while preventing relative movement in one or more other<br>
predetermined directions, thereby locking out the other operational modes. Thus,<br>
locking system 10 provides electronic device 12 with multiple, discrete operational<br>
modes while preventing problems associated with attempted actuation of more than one<br>
operational mode at a time.<br>
[0039] Referring to Figs. 1-9 and 13-16, locking system 10 may include at least one<br>
limiting member 40, 42, 44 associated with each module layer 14, 16, 18. Limiting<br>
members 40, 42, 44 may act in one or more combinations during actuation of a selected<br>
operational mode to allow certain relative movements between module layers 14, 16, 38<br>
while preventing other relative movements. Referring specifically to Figs. 9 and 14-16,<br>
each limiting member 40, 42, 44 may include one or more displacement surfaces 41, 43,<br>
45, 47 (Fig. 9) associated with providing relative movement in at least a first<br>
predetermined direction between the respective limiting members. Suitable examples of<br>
displacement surfaces 41, 43, 45, 47 include one or a combination of linear, planar,<br>
pointed and curved surfaces, and any other surface capable of transferring a<br>
7<br>
displacement force to or from a limiting member 40, 42, 44. Additionally, each limiting<br>
member 40, 42, 44 may include one or more locking surfaces 49, 51, 53 that<br>
substantially limit or prevent relative movement in one or more predetermined<br>
directions. As utilized here, the term "substantially limit or prevent" refers to<br>
minimizing relative movement in a given direction such that an operational mode<br>
associated with the relative movement in the given direction is not actuated. Suitable<br>
examples of locking surfaces 49, 51, 53 include linear, planar, pointed and curved<br>
surfaces, and other similar surfaces that resist or substantially prevent the transfer of a<br>
displacement force to or from a limiting member 40, 42, 44, and hence resist or<br>
substantially prevent displacement of a limiting member 40, 42, 44, in at least one<br>
predetermined direction. During predetermined relative movements between module<br>
layers 14, 16, 18, displacement surfaces 41, 47 engage corresponding displacement<br>
surfaces 43, 45 to move limiting member 42, causing one of locking surfaces 49 or 53 to<br>
engage the corresponding locking surface 51 and lock out other predetermined relative<br>
movements and thereby allow actuation of a single operational mode of electronic<br>
device 12,<br>
[00401 In °ne embodiment, for example referring to Figs. 14-16, limiting members 40,<br>
44 are respectively positioned on the interior-facing surfaces 100 (also see Fig. 5), 102<br>
(also see Fig. 9) of upper and lower module layers 14, 18 adjacent to limiting member<br>
42 when electronic device 12 is in a first or neutral orientation. Limiting members 40,<br>
44 respectively include a displacement surface 41, 47 connected to a locking surface 49,<br>
53 that joins an end wall 104, 106 to define respective cavities 108, 110 in surfaces 100,<br>
102. Cavities 108, 110 are sized to receive at least a portion of limiting member 42. In<br>
this embodiment, displacement surfaces 41, 47 are corners or points formed at the<br>
intersection of the respective interior-facing surfaces 100, 102 and the locking surfaces<br>
49, 53. As discussed above, however, it should be noted that in alternate embodiments<br>
the displacement surfaces 41, 47 may take other forms, such as an angled or beveled<br>
portion of a side wall of a cavity, where such angling or beveling may provide for<br>
smoother contact with an adjacent limiting member during relative movements between<br>
module layers 14, 16, 18. Further, locking surfaces 49, 53 in this embodiment are<br>
substantially perpendicular to interior-facing surfaces 100, 102 and extend inward to<br>
define circular side walls of cavities 108, 110. Again, as discussed above, it should be<br>
noted that in alternate embodiments the locking surfaces 49, 53 may take other forms,<br>
such as angled surfaces, and other shapes depending on the given application and/or the<br>
configuration of limiting member 42.<br>
[0041] Further, for example, limiting member 42 in one embodiment may take the<br>
form of an elongated body, such as a pin or a rod of any cross section, positioned within<br>
a cavity 111 in middle module layer 16 and movably in contact with one embodiment of<br>
a biasing mechanism 112 (also see Fig. 13) that may provide biasing forces to move or<br>
resist movement of the elongated body within the module layer. Limiting member 42<br>
includes opposing first and second ends 46, 48 (Fig. 13) that, in a first or neutral<br>
position (Figs. 2, 3 and 14), extend a first predetermined distance 114, 116 (Fig. 14)<br>
beyond the top and bottom surfaces 118 (also see Fig. 5), 120 (also see Fig. 9) of middle<br>
module layer 16. In one embodiment, first predetermined distances 114, 116 are a<br>
sufficient distance for at least a portion of the respective end 46, 48 to extend into the<br>
corresponding cavity 108, 110 for engagement by the respective limiting member 40, 44<br>
during actuation of the second or third operational mode of electronic device 12. It<br>
should be noted that first predetermined distances 114, 116 may be equal or unequal<br>
distances. As such, in this embodiment, this first or neutral position of limiting member<br>
42 is associated with the first operational mode of electronic device 12 and allows<br>
relative movement between module layers 14, 16, 19 in either first or second directions<br>
28, 34. Further, limiting member 42 may have a second position (Figs. 5, 6 and 16)<br>
where second end 48 extends a second predetermined distance 122 (Fig. 16) further<br>
away from bottom surface 120 than first predetermined distance 116 (Fig. 14) while<br>
first end 46 is substantially level with top surface 118. In this embodiment, second<br>
predetermined distance 122 is a sufficient distance to cause limiting members 42, 44 to<br>
become engageable to substantially prevent relative movement in at least second<br>
direction 34 between middle and lower module layers 16, 18 and to allow relative<br>
movement of upper module layer 14 in first direction 28. As such, this second position<br>
of limiting member 42 corresponds to the second operational mode of electronic device<br>
12. Additionally, limiting member 42 may have a third position (Figs. 8 and 9) where<br>
first end 46 extends a third predetermined distance 124 further away from top surface<br>
110 than first predetermined distance 114 (Fig. 14) while second end 48 is substantially<br>
level with bottom surface 112. In this embodiment, third predetermined distance 124 is<br>
a sufficient distance to cause limiting members 40, 42 to become engageable to<br>
substantially prevent relative movement in at least first direction 28 between upper and<br>
middle module layers 14, 16 and to allow relative movement of lower module layer 18<br>
in second direction 34. As such, this third position of limiting member 42 corresponds<br>
to the third operational mode of electronic device 12. In this embodiment the movement<br>
of limiting member 42 between the first, second and third positions includes a<br>
substantially linear movement substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis 126 of<br>
limiting member 42. It should be noted, however, that limiting member 42 and/or<br>
biasing mechanism 112 and/or middle module layer 16 may be configured to allow<br>
other movements, such as rotational movements, non-parallel movements and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0042] First and second ends 46, 48 of limiting member 42 respectively include at<br>
least one displacement surface 43, 45 for transferring a displacement force to or from<br>
limiting member 42. In one embodiment, displacement surfaces 43, 45 may be oriented<br>
to receive a displacement force from a first direction and transfer the displacement force<br>
to limiting member 42, resulting in movement of the limiting member between the first,<br>
second and third positions described above. For example, displacement surface 43 may<br>
be oriented to face opposite to first direction 28 and displacement surface 45 may be<br>
oriented to face opposite to second direction 34 so as to allow relative movement<br>
between module layers 14, 16, 18 to change electronic device 12 from the first<br>
operational mode to a selected one of the second or third operational modes while<br>
locking out actuation of the non-selected mode. Further, in one embodiment referring to<br>
Figs. 2 and 3, displacement surfaces 43, 45 include a planar portion positioned at an<br>
oblique angle 128 relative to longitudinal axis 126 of limiting member 42. It should be<br>
noted, however, that displacement surfaces 43, 45 may also be positioned obliquely<br>
relative to a direction or vector of a received displacement force, or relative to a<br>
direction or vector of a desired movement of elongated body 42. As such, in one<br>
embodiment, for example, displacement surfaces 43, 45 of limiting member 42 interact<br>
with the respective displacement surfaces 41, 47 of limiting members 40, 44 during<br>
predetermined relative movement between module layers 14, 16, 18 and thereby define<br>
a cam interface that causes a displacement or movement of limiting member 42. This<br>
cam interface may have an angle relative to the received force or direction of<br>
displacement of about less than about 90 degrees, while in another embodiment the<br>
relative angle may range from about 60 degrees to about 10 degrees, and in yet another<br>
embodiment the relative angle may range from about 50 degrees to about 20 degrees.<br>
Further, it should be noted that displacement surfaces 43, 45 may be oriented in any<br>
manner that results in the transfer of forces that cause any type or direction of linear or<br>
rotational movement of limiting member 42.<br>
[0043] Additionally, locking surface 51 of limiting member 42 may be formed on<br>
some portion of, or adjacent to, first and second ends 46, 48. In one embodiment,<br>
locking surface 51 may be oriented substantially perpendicular to a direction or vector<br>
of a received displacement force so as to substantially resist or prevent movement of<br>
limiting member 42. For example, in the embodiment where limiting member 42 is<br>
defined by a rod or pin having a circular cross-section, locking surface 51 may include<br>
the entire surface area of the rod or pin except for displacement surfaces 43, 45 at each<br>
end 46, 48. As such, when properly positioned, locking surface 51 engages the<br>
corresponding locking surface 49, 53 of respective limiting member 40, 44 to<br>
substantially resist or prevent a transfer of a displacement force that would cause<br>
limiting member 42 to move between the first, second and third positions described<br>
above, and thereby prevents predetermined relative movements between module, layers<br>
14, 16, 18 during actuation of predetermined operational modes.<br>
[0044] Suitable materials for forming limiting members 40, 42, 44 include metals,<br>
plastics, composites, ceramics, and combinations thereof. Limiting members 40, 42, 44<br>
may be formed integrally with a respective module layer 14,16,18 or formed separately<br>
and attached. Further, limiting members 40, 42, 44 may be attached via mechanical<br>
methods such as via screws, nails, rivets, swaging, sonic welding, etc, as well as via<br>
chemical methods such as bonding.<br>
[0045] Limiting members 40, 42, 44 may be associated with, and arranged on, each<br>
respective module layer 14, 16, 18 in any combination and in any position or<br>
configuration that allows actuation of the various operational modes of electronic device<br>
12. For instance, alternate embodiments may include a pin or rod and a biasing<br>
mechanism connected to both upper and lower module layers 14, 18 while<br>
corresponding separate cavities or one through cavity of is formed in middle module<br>
layer 16. Further, the relative position of each limiting member 40, 42, 44 on each<br>
module layer 14, 16, 18 may be varied. Additionally, in other embodiments, locking<br>
system 10 and/or limiting members 40, 42, 44 may include all or some portion of the<br>
locking system and limiting member structure disclosed in U.S. Appl. Serial No.<br>
, entitled "Devices And Methods For Controlling Relative Movement Between<br>
Layers Of An Electronic Device," Attorney Docket No. 040166, filed , hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
10046] As mentioned above, referring to Figs. 13-16, biasing mechanism 112 in one<br>
embodiment provides a connection, and allows relative movement, between limiting<br>
member 42 and middle module layer 16. Biasing mechanism 112 may be fixedly<br>
attached, mechanically or chemically, to one or both of limiting member 42 and middle<br>
module layer 16, such as by respectively fitting into a notch or bonding. Alternatively,<br>
biasing mechanism 112 may be merely contactable with one or both of limiting member<br>
42 and middle module layer 16, so as to allow at least some degree of independent<br>
movement. Biasing mechanism 112 provides at least opposing first and second biasing<br>
forces that urge limiting member 42 into the neutral or first position and that<br>
respectively oppose movements into the second and third positions, as described above.<br>
In this embodiment, biasing mechanism 112 provides biasing forces that substantially<br>
act in a direction parallel to longitudinal axis 126 of limiting member 42. Suitable<br>
examples of biasing mechanism 112 include a leaf spring, a Belleville washer, a<br>
compression spring, an extension spring, a torsion spring, a buckling column, any. type<br>
of resilient member, mechanical linkages associated with movement of module layers<br>
14, 16, 18, a cam follower mechanism, and other types of mechanisms for causing a<br>
force to act upon limiting member 42. One or more biasing mechanisms 112 may be<br>
associated with a limiting member, or with more than one limiting member.<br>
[0047] In another embodiment, referring to Figs. 20 and 21, biasing mechanism 132<br>
may be positioned in any orientation relative to a limiting member 242, which is similar<br>
to limiting member 42 but with the addition of cam surfaces 138, 140 on its side, to<br>
provide a biasing force substantially normal to longitudinal axis 126 of limiting member<br>
242. Such a configuration allows biasing mechanism 132 in combination with cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140 to movably retain limiting member 242 in one or more positions<br>
relative to middle module layer 16, In one embodiment, referring to Fig. 20, biasing<br>
mechanism 132 may further include a cam follower 136, connected to biasing member<br>
134, that interacts with surface 51 of limiting member 242. Surface 51 may include cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140 that, through interaction with cam follower 136 and/or biasing<br>
member 134, resist movement of limiting member 242 out of, or encourage movement<br>
into, a neutral position 145 relative to biasing mechanism 132. In this example, cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140 may be linear and/or curved surfaces which may be oriented<br>
substantially oblique and/or substantially normal with respect to longitudinal axis 126.<br>
For instance, cam surfaces 138, 140 may meet at neutral position 145 and diverge away<br>
from one another so as to receive increasing biasing forces from biasing mechanism 132<br>
upon increasing relative movement away from neutral position 145. Further, cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140 may extend along surface 51 for a portion or for substantially the<br>
entire longitudinal height, and/or exterior surface or circumference, of limiting member<br>
242. As such, the increasing biasing forces caused by the interaction of cam surfaces<br>
138, 140 and biasing mechanism 132 may act on limiting member 242 for a portion or<br>
for substantially the entire length of the movement of limiting member 242 to promote<br>
movement of limiting member 242 into neutral position 145, or to oppose movement of<br>
limiting member 242 toward upper and lower module or component layers 14, 18.<br>
Although shown as two surfaces, cam surfaces 138, 140 may include only one surface,<br>
such as a curved surface, or more than two surfaces, such as multiple linear surfaces,<br>
multiple curved surfaces or combinations of linear and curved surfaces. Additionally,<br>
although shown as a v-shaped section turned 90 degrees clockwise, the cam surface or<br>
surfaces may form a section of any shape that promotes the ability of limiting member<br>
242 to be movably retained relative to biasing mechanism 132.<br>
[0048] Referring additionally to Fig. 21, limiting member 242 may optionally include<br>
one or a plurality of guide flanges 142 movably positioned within a corresponding one<br>
or plurality of guide channels 144 to form a guide mechanism to orient limiting member<br>
242 within middle module layer 16. For instance, such a guide mechanism substantially<br>
prevents rotation of limiting member 242 about longitudinal axis 126, thereby assuring<br>
a predetermined alignment of the interacting displacement surfaces 43 and 41, and 45<br>
and 47 (not shown). Further, such a guide mechanism may additionally serve to align<br>
cam surfaces 138, 140 with biasing mechanism 132. Guide flanges 142 may include<br>
any surface or structure projecting from limiting member 242. Similarly, guide channel<br>
144 may include any surface or structure defining a depression in middle module or<br>
component layer 16 that corresponds with guide flange 144. Alternatively, middle<br>
module or component layer 16 may be formed with a guide flange, while limiting<br>
member may be formed with a guide channel.<br>
[0049] As discussed with reference to Figs. 20 and 21, cam surfaces 138, 140 may<br>
form a notch or channel in a portion, or around the circumference or entire external part,<br>
of surface 51 of limiting member 242. Alternatively, the limiting member may include<br>
a biasing member and the wall structure of the adjacent module or component layer may<br>
include the corresponding cam surfaces to produce the desired biasing effect. Further,<br>
biasing member 134 may be fixedly or movably connected with or retained within<br>
middle module layer 16, such as by mechanical or chemical means. Suitable examples<br>
of biasing member 134 include a leaf spring, a Belleville washer, a compression spring,<br>
an extension spring, a torsion spring, a buckling column, any type of resilient member,<br>
mechanical linkages associated with movement of module layers 14, 16, 18, a cam<br>
follower mechanism and other types of mechanisms for causing a force to act upon<br>
limiting member 242. Further, cam follower 136 may be fixedly or movably attached to<br>
biasing member 134, such as by mechanical or chemical means, or alternatively may be<br>
formed integrally with biasing member 134. Cam follower 136 includes any rotating or<br>
sliding structure capable of following the cam surfaces and capable of transferring a<br>
force between biasing member 134 and limiting member 242. For instance, cam<br>
follower 136 may be a ball bearing, a wheel, a curved surface, a pointed surface, etc.<br>
As with biasing mechanism 112, it should be noted that one or more biasing<br>
mechanisms 132 may be associated with a corresponding limiting member or with more<br>
than one limiting member. Further, biasing mechanisms 112 and 132 may be utilized<br>
individually or in combination to provide normal and parallel biasing forces acting,upon<br>
a limiting member. For instance, limiting member 242 of Fig. 20 may have cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140 that extend substantially the entire longitudinal length of the limiting<br>
member, thereby allowing biasing mechanism 132 to provide biasing forces to bias<br>
limiting member 242 into neutral position 145. As such, biasing mechanism 112 may<br>
not be necessary depending on the configuration of biasing mechanism 132 and cam<br>
surfaces 138, 140.<br>
[0050] Referring to Figs. 17-19, it should also be noted that connection mechanisms<br>
50, 52, 54, 56 may additionally form a portion of, or at least provide assistance to,<br>
locking system 10. One or more connection mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56 may be utilized<br>
to movably connect the module layers 14, 16, 18 such that the various relative<br>
movements are achievable. For example, in one embodiment, connection mechanisms<br>
50, 52 movably connect upper and middle module layers 14, 16 for relative movement<br>
in at least first direction 28, while connection mechanisms 54, 56 movably connect<br>
middle and lower module layers 16, 18 for relative movement in at least second<br>
direction 34. In this example, connection mechanisms 54, 56 may aid locking system<br>
10 by preventing relative movement between middle and lower module layers 16, 18 in<br>
first direction 28. As such, during movement of upper module layer 14 in first direction<br>
28 to actuate the second operational mode (see Figs. 5 and 6), limiting member 42 is<br>
forced to extend into limiting member 44 such that the side wall or locking surface 53 of<br>
cavity 110 may engage locking surface 51 to substantially limit or prevent relative<br>
movement of middle and lower module layers 16, 18 in first direction 28 while<br>
connection mechanisms 54, 56 also may act to substantially limit or prevent relative<br>
movement of middle and lower module layers 16, 18 in first direction 28. As a result,<br>
there is a discrete actuation of the second operational mode which provides a user with<br>
positive haptic feedback. Whether or not both or one of the limiting members and<br>
connection mechanisms act to engage middle and lower module layers 16, 18 and limit<br>
their relative movement in first direction 28 during actuation of the second operational<br>
mode depends on various factors, such as dimensional characteristics and tolerances.<br>
Further, it should be noted that connection mechanisms 54, 56 may not be required<br>
limiting member 42 is movably connected to upper module layer 14, thereby effectively<br>
providing a movable relationship between middle and lower module layers 16, 18<br>
guided by limiting member 42. Alternatively, connection mechanisms 54, 56 may<br>
allow relative movement between middle and lower module layers 16, 18 in any<br>
direction if other structures are utilized to guide the relative movement during actuation<br>
of the operational modes.<br>
[0051] Similarly, connection mechanisms 50, 52 may aid locking system 10 by<br>
preventing relative movement between upper and middle module layers 14, 16 in<br>
second direction 34. As such, during movement of lower module layer 18 in second<br>
direction 34 to actuate the third operational mode (see Figs. 8 and 9), limiting member<br>
42 is forced to extend into limiting member 40 such that the side wall or locking surface<br>
49 of cavity 108 may engage locking surface 51 (Figs. 14-16) to substantially limit or<br>
prevent relative movement of upper and middle module layers 14, 16 in second<br>
direction 34 while connection mechanisms 50, 52 also may substantially limit or<br>
prevent relative movement of upper and middle module layers 14, 16 in second<br>
direction 34. Again, the result is a discrete actuation of the third operational mode<br>
which provides a user with positive haptic feedback. Additionally, it should be noted<br>
that connection mechanisms 50, 52 may not be required at all, or may allow relative<br>
movement between upper and middle module layers 14, 16 in any direction if other<br>
structures are utilized to guide the relative movement.<br>
[0052] Connection mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56 may include various types of magnetic<br>
connectors and mechanical connectors. In one embodiment, referring to Fig. 19 for<br>
example, connection mechanisms 50 or 52 or 54 or 56 include a carrier body 58<br>
movably connectable to a rail member 60 for movement along the length of the rail<br>
member. Carrier body 58 maybe fixedly attached to one module layer 14, 16, 18, such<br>
as by mechanical or chemical fastening, while rail member 60 may be fixedly attached<br>
in a similar manner to the adjacent module layer to provide for the desired relative<br>
movement between layers. Referring to Figs. 17 and 18, rail members associated with<br>
connection mechanisms 50, 52 have a length extending parallel to first direction 28,<br>
while rail members associated with connection mechanisms 54, 56 have a length<br>
extending parallel to second direction 34. As such, each carrier body 58 is movable in<br>
both directions along the length of each rail. It should be noted, however, that rail<br>
members 60 may be positioned in any orientation relative to one another in order to<br>
achieve a desired relative movement for each module layer 14, 16, 18. As such, in this<br>
embodiment, the respective rail members and carrier bodies associated with connection<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56 respectively provide the relative movement of upper and<br>
middle module layers 14, 16 to be substantially perpendicular to the relative movement<br>
of middle and lower module layers 16, 18. Although connection members 50, 52, 54,<br>
56 are represented as bi-directional sliding connectors, it should be noted that these<br>
connection members may provide movement along more than one axis, in more than<br>
one plane, and the movement may include linear and/or rotary motion. Further,<br>
connection mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56 may comprise metals, plastics, composites, and<br>
ceramics, and they may be formed integrally with each module layer 14, 16, 18 or<br>
separately attached via mechanical or chemical methods<br>
[0053] Referring to Figs. 4-9, in some embodiments, electronic device 12 may further<br>
include protective surfaces 128, 130 respectively positioned on surfaces 100, 102 along<br>
respective paths where limiting member 42 may contact the surfaces 100, 102.<br>
Protective layers 128, 130 provide the respective module or component layer 14 or 18<br>
with protection against damage caused by contact with limiting member 42. For<br>
example, protective surface 128 may lie on upper module layer 14 along a first path<br>
parallel to first direction 28, while protective surface 130 may lie on lower module layer<br>
18 along a second path parallel to second direction 34. In one embodiment, protective<br>
layers 128, 130 have a surface hardness greater than the surface hardness of the<br>
respective module or component layer on which they are located. In another<br>
embodiment, protective layers 128, 130 have a coefficient of friction less than a<br>
coefficient of friction of the respective module or component layer on which they are<br>
located. Suitable examples of materials used to form protective layers 128, 130 include<br>
plastics, polymers, elastomers, rubbers, ceramics, metals, etc. Protective layers 128,<br>
130 may be mechanically or chemically bonded to the respective module or component<br>
layer 14, 18, or may be integrally formed or molded into the layer. Alternatively,<br>
protective layers, or whole end portions, may be formed on the respective limiting<br>
members that contact the sliding module or component layers 14, 18.<br>
[0054J Although shown as including three layers, electronic device 12 may include<br>
any plurality of module layers that each may include one or more sets of functional<br>
components associated with one or more operational modes. In this embodiment, the<br>
module layers 14, 16, 18 substantially lie in and are movable within parallel planes. It<br>
should be noted, however, that their relative motion may also include rotational motion<br>
about an axis intersecting one of the planes or linear motion normal to one of the planes.<br>
The one or more operational modes enable device 12 to be utilized as one or more of: a<br>
mobile, satellite or wireless phone or audio communications device, a gaming device, a<br>
personal digital assistant ("PDA"), a pager or text communications device, a global<br>
positioning system ("GPS"), a remote control device for controlling another system, an<br>
audio player and/or recorder device such as an MP3 player or digital recorder, a static or<br>
dynamic video player and/or recorder device, a calculator device, etc. When utilized as<br>
a mobile phone, for example, device 12 may include hardware, software and/or<br>
firmware for sending and/or receiving communications-related signals using protocols<br>
such as a code division multiple access ("CDMA"), wide-band code division multiple<br>
access ("WCDMA"), global system for mobile communications ("GSM"), advance<br>
mobile phone service ("AMPS") and time division multiple access ("TDMA").<br>
[0055] The one or more sets of components associated with each layer of device 12,<br>
such as module layers 14, 16, 18, may include one or more of plurality of types of<br>
functional components. These sets of components include external components, such as<br>
input and output type of mechanisms, and also internal components such as circuit<br>
boards and circuit elements such as transistors, chips, firmware, memory, software and<br>
processing units configured for one or more operational modes of device 12. For<br>
example, as mentioned above, first set of components 20 may include display 22, which<br>
includes any type of textual and/or graphical output (and/or input) unit such as an liquid<br>
crystal display, a light-emitting diode display, a touch screen, etc. Directional keypads<br>
24, 26 include toggle keys, navigation keys and other individual or multiple function<br>
keys associated with controlling movement of a graphic on display 22 or associated<br>
with creating an input signal to device 12. First set of components 20 may also include<br>
other components such as: an audio speaker 66 (Fig. 10), such as a near-field and/or farfield<br>
speaker, for outputting audio signals; one or more indicator lights 68, 70 (Fig. 10)<br>
for signaling a status of the device 12; operational keys 72, 74 (Fig. 10) such as an<br>
on/off or hang-up key and a call accept/send key; volume keys 76 for increasing or<br>
decreasing a volume of a speaker such as near-field speaker 66; a push-to-talk button 78<br>
(Fig. 11) for transmitting a voice signal in a walkie-talkie type phone mode; a record<br>
key 80 (Fig. 11) for activation a voice recorder functionality; a speaker/microphone<br>
input 82 (Fig. 11) for receiving a remote audio speaker and/or microphone connection<br>
mechanism; a camera mechanism 84 (Figs. 17 and 18) for taking still or video pictures;<br>
a test port 86 (Figs. 17 and 18) for connecting test or monitoring equipment, such as<br>
radio frequency ("RF") signaling equipment, to set-up, repair or test electronic device<br>
12; an infra red ("IR") transceiver 88 (Figs. 17 and 18) for sending and/or receiving data<br>
via IR waves; a battery pack 90 (Figs. 17and 18) for providing a cordless power source<br>
to device 12; a power/data connector 92 (Figs. 10-12 and 17-18) for establishing a hardwired<br>
connection to a source of power to operate device 12 and/or recharge battery pack<br>
90 and to transmit and/or receive data; and an antenna mechanism 94 (Fig. 10) for<br>
transmitting and/or receiving communications signals associated with one or more of<br>
the modes of device 12. Similarly, first and second set of additional components 30, 36<br>
may include other functional components, such as any of the above-mentioned<br>
components, associated with a desired operational mode. It should be noted that the<br>
components associated with device 12 may be arranged in any combination, and on any<br>
layer, in order to achieve a desired configuration for each operational mode of device<br>
12.<br>
[0056] In operation, for example, the various operational modes of device 12 are<br>
controlled by the relative positioning of each layer of device 12. A method of<br>
controlling relative movement between these layers includes movably interconnecting<br>
various module layers to allow relative movement that exposes various functional<br>
components associated with each layer. Further, in order to provide a discrete actuation<br>
of an individual operational mode, the device further includes a locking mechanism that<br>
prevents movement between predetermined layers during actuation of predetermined<br>
modes.<br>
[0057] In this embodiment, for example, referring back to Figs. 1-3 and 10, the first<br>
operational mode of electronic device 12 may be achieved by orienting the module<br>
layers 14, 16, 18 of electronic device 12 in the first or neutral relative position. In one<br>
embodiment, locking system 10 is in a neutral position that allows relative movement of<br>
upper module layer 14 in first direction 28 or relative movement of lower module layer<br>
18 in second direction 34. .In particular, limiting member 42 is oriented in its first or<br>
neutral position with displacement surface 43 facing first direction 28 and extending<br>
into cavity 108 of limiting member 40 an amount that overlaps with displacement<br>
surface 41. Further, in this orientation of limiting member 42, displacement surface 45<br>
faces second direction 34 and extends into cavity 110 of limiting member 44 an amount<br>
that overlaps with displacement surface 47. Additionally, locking surface 51 may be<br>
engageable with locking surface 49 to prevent relative motion of upper module layer 14<br>
in second direction 34, and/or connection mechanisms 50, 52 may also prohibit this<br>
relative motion. Similarly, locking surface 51 may be engageable with locking surface<br>
53 to prevent relative motion of lower module layer 18 in first direction 28, and/or<br>
connection mechanisms 54, 56 may also prohibit this relative motion.<br>
[00581 P°r example, the first operational mode may correspond to one or more of a<br>
gaming mode, a PDA mode, a camera mode, a GPS mode, a calculator mode, a data<br>
transfer mode and/or a phone stand-by mode. First set of components 20 may be<br>
utilized in various combinations to achieve the desired functionality of this mode. For<br>
instance, when operated as a gaming device in this first mode, device 12 may be held<br>
such that its width is its longest dimension, and directional keypads 24, 26 are utilized<br>
for controlling gaming functions. Additionally, associated with the actuation of this<br>
mode, device 12 may present the text and/or graphics output from display 22 in a<br>
predetermined orientation based on the selected operational mode. So, for example, the<br>
text/graphics in the gaming mode may be oriented 90 degrees relative to the<br>
text/graphics in a phone or PDA mode. Further, first set of components 20 may<br>
simultaneously be functioning in more than one mode, such as in a phone stand-by<br>
mode, where upon receiving a phone call an output may be generated, such as by one or<br>
more of display 22, indicator lights 68, 70 and speaker 66. A user may change device<br>
12 into a phone mode by then sliding upper module layer 14 in first direction 28 or by<br>
accepting the call by depressing call accept key 74. In the PDA mode, a user may view<br>
data from display 22 and utilize any of the keys or buttons to produce inputs. Further,<br>
display 22 may be a touch screen display that allows additional inputs. In the camera<br>
mode, a user may operate camera 84 (Figs. 4 and 5) to take a still picture or a video,<br>
which may also allow the user to record any audio signals received by microphone 32<br>
(Fig. 2) and associated with the picture or video. Further, in the data transfer mode, data<br>
may be received by or sent from device 12 through one or more of test port 86 (Figs. 4<br>
and 5), IR transceiver 88 and power/data connector 92.<br>
 [0059] A user activates a second operational mode, such as the phone mode (Fig. 4-6,<br>
11 and 14-17), by moving upper module layer 14 in first direction 28 and exposing<br>
phone keypad 31. During this actuation step, locking system 10 prevents one or more<br>
additional relative movements between the remaining layers that are associated with<br>
actuation of additional operational modes. In one embodiment, for example, locking<br>
system 10 is in a second position that allows relative movement of upper module layer<br>
14 in first direction 28 and prevents relative movement of lower module layer 18 in<br>
second direction 34. In particular, movement of upper module layer 14 in first direction<br>
28 causes displacement surface 41 of limiting member 40 to contact displacement<br>
surface 43 of limiting member 42, thereby transferring the displacement force<br>
associated with the moving module layer to limiting member 42. This transference of<br>
the displacement force causes movement of limiting member 42 along longitudinal axis<br>
126, thereby urging first end 46 out of cavity 108 and second end 48 further into cavity<br>
110. Additionally, by positioning displacement surface 45 entirely within cavity 110,<br>
locking surface 51 may be engageable with locking surface 53 to prevent relative<br>
motion between middle and lower module layers 16, 18 in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the locking surfaces 51, 53.<br>
[0060J tn this phone mode, hardware, software and/or firmware within device 12<br>
recognize the actuation of this mode and orient the output of display 22 such that it is<br>
aligned for use in combination with phone keypad 31. Further, device 12 actuates<br>
predetermined internal circuitry associated with the functionality of this mode, such as<br>
communications hardware and software for sending and receiving wireless signals. A<br>
user may communicate by talking into microphone 32 and by listening to speaker 66.<br>
Further, additional phone-related functions may be performed via keystrokes on phone<br>
keypad 31 and send key 74, or by using directional keypad 24 or 26. This mode may be<br>
turned off, for example, by sliding upper module layer 14 back into the neutral position<br>
(Fig. 1) or by depressing the off key 72.<br>
[0061] A user activates the third operational mode or pager or two-way text<br>
communications mode, referring to Fig. 7-9, 12 and 18, by moving lower module layer<br>
18 in second direction 34 and thereby exposing QWERTY keyboard 38. During this<br>
actuation step, locking system 10 prevents additional relative movement between the<br>
remaining layers that are associated with actuation of additional operational modes. In<br>
one embodiment, for example, locking system 10 is in a third position that allows<br>
relative movement of lower module layer 18 in third direction 34 and prevents relative<br>
movement of upper module layer 14 in second direction 28. In particular, movement of<br>
lower module layer 18 in second direction 34 causes displacement surface 47 of limiting<br>
member 44 to contact displacement surface 45 of limiting member 42, thereby<br>
transferring the displacement force associated with the moving module layer to limiting<br>
member 42. This transference of the displacement force causes movement of limiting<br>
member 42 along longitudinal axis 126, thereby urging second end 48 out of cavity 110<br>
and first end 46 further into cavity 108. Additionally, by positioning displacement<br>
surface 43 entirely within cavity 108, locking surface 51 may be engageable with<br>
locking surface 49 to prevent relative motion between upper and middle module layers<br>
14, 16 in a direction perpendicular to the locking surfaces 49, 51.<br>
[0062] In this operational mode, hardware, software and/or firmware within device 12<br>
recognize the actuation of this mode and orient the output of display 22 such that it is<br>
aligned for use in combination with QWERTY keyboard 38. Further, device 12<br>
actuates predetermined internal circuitry associated with the functionality of this mode,<br>
such as communications hardware and software for sending and receiving wireless<br>
signals. A user may communicate, for example, by reading received text messages<br>
output by display 22 or by entering characters from keyboard 38 and sending to another<br>
device via send key 74. This mode may be turned off, for example, by sliding lower<br>
module layer 18 back into the neutral position or by depressing the off key 72.<br>
[0063] Thus, the described embodiments provide devices and methods for controlling<br>
the actuation of an operational mode of device 12 by allowing certain relative<br>
movements between certain module layers while limiting other predetermined relative<br>
movements between other module layers. A locking system associated with each<br>
module layer is configured to control these various relative movements. While the<br>
various disclosed embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that<br>
the subject matter of this document is not limited to these embodiments only,<br>
Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
