A process for the preparation of a compound of formula 1, wherein R1 and R2 stand for phenyl, has been disclosed by O'Donneil and is reviewed in O'Donneil et a/, Aldrichimica Acta (2001) vol. 34, pp 3-15. In this process of O'Donneil, theα-amino carbonyl compound is prepared by deprotonation of a starting material and subsequent reaction with an electrophile. The starting materials in this O'Donneil process are imines derived from benzophenone and glycine esters or from benzophenone and glycine amides.<br>
However, a drawback of this process is that the preparation of these imine starting materials is commercially less attractive. One possible synthetic route involves the direct reaction of a glycine ester with benzophenone. However, due to the low reactivity of benzophenone this method requires the use of a strong Lewis acid catalyst (e.g. BF3.Et20). In addition to the toxicity of such reagents, this methodology also results in low product yields (due to the formation of side-products) and renders the purification of the product difficult. Another possible route to prepare these imine starting materials is via a transimination reaction. In this case the hydrochloride salt of a glycine ester is reacted with benzophenone imine. However, benzophenone imine must itself be prepared by the addition of an organometallic reagent to benzonitrile, which makes this a commercially less attractive alternative. Processes involving the use of such imine starting materials are therefore not very suitable for large scale commercial production.<br>
it is the object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of an α-amino-carbonyl compound of formula 1 from a starting material, which starling material may be prepared by a commercially attractive route.<br><br>

The invention includes different embodiments with different conditions, which can be employed for the preparation of an α-amino carbonyl compound of formula 1. For example, in one aspect of the invention a compound of formula 1 can be prepared from a compound of formula 2 by reacting a compound of formula 2 with a suitable electrophile in the presence of a base in an anhydrous organic solvent.<br>

13, most preferably a pKa &gt; 15, is used in the preparation of a compound of formula 1 from a compound of formula 2 in an anhydrous organic solvent<br>
The specific choice of anhydrous organic solvent is, in principle, not critical.

In another aspect of the invention, the preparation of a compound of formula 1 from a compound of formula 2 can be achieved by reacting a compound of formula 2 with a suitable electrophile in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst in a two-phase system. Most commonly used two-phase systems are liquid-liquid systems or solid-liquid systems.

In a special aspect of the invention, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of an enantiomerically enriched compound of formula 1 from a compound of formula 2 by reacting a compound of formula 2 with a suitable electrophile in the presence of a base and a chiral and enantiomerically enriched phase transfer catalyst in a two-phase system. Preferably the enantiomerically enriched phase transfer catalyst has an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) &gt; 90%, more preferably &gt; 95%, most preferably &gt; 98%. Many enantiomerically enriched compounds are important building blocks in the synthesis of drugs.<br>
Chiral and enantiomerically enriched phase transfer catalysts are known in the art and include, for example, derivatives of N-alkylated cinchona alkaloids (for instance described in WO95/06029). Suitable examples of chiral and enantiomerically enriched phase transfer catalysts for these types of reactions are for instance described in the following references: M. O'Donnell, Aldrichimica Acta (2001) 34t 3-15; B. Lygo, Tetrahedron Lett (1997) 38, 8597-8600; EJ. Corey, J, Am. Chem.<br><br>
Soc. (1997) 119,12414-12415; M. Shibasaki, Tetrahedron Lett. (2002) 43, 9539-9543.<br>
In a special aspect of the invention, a diasteromerically enriched compound of formula 1 may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 2 having one or more chiral groups with a suitable electrophile in the presence of a base. The chiral group(s) may be removed after effecting its diastereomeric induction. In case that the compound of formula 2 having the chiral group(s) is enantiomerically enriched, the resulting compound of formula 1 may be obtained both diastereomerically enriched and enantiomerically enriched. Preferably the enantiomerically enriched compound of formula 2 has &gt; 90% e.e., more preferably &gt; 95% e.e., most preferably &gt; 98% e.e.. If the compound of formula 2 has more than one chiral group, it is preferred that all chiral groups are enantiomerically enriched. Especially attractive is the case wherein the compound of formula 2 is enantiomerically enriched and wherein X stands for a chiral group, which chiral group is derived from a chiral alcohol RBOH or from a chiral amine HNR3R4, wherein R3f R4 and R5 are as defined above.<br>
The use of an enantiomerically enriched compound with a chiral group, in order to obtain a diastereomerically and enantiomerically enriched compound is for instance described by C. Najera, Angew. Chem. (1997) 36, 995-997; A. Lopez, Tetrahedron Asymm. (1998) 9,1967-1970; C. Najera, Tetrahedron Asymm. (1998) 9, 3935-3938; and Y.S. Park, Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. (2001) 22t 958-962.<br>
A compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above, can, for instance, easily be prepared by reacting a glyoxylic acid ester<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above. This process for the preparation of a compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above, is a cheap and commercially attractive process, due to a combination of beneficial effects, for instance, glyoxylic acid esters and glyoxylic acid ester derivatives of formula 3 are<br><br>
cheap and readily available and/or the process proceeds with a high yield and/or the process proceeds almost without the formation of any side products.<br>
A compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above, can, for instance, easily be prepared by further reacting the imine of a glyoxylic acid compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein<br>
  (5)<br>
wherein R3and R4 are as defined above.<br>
The ease with which this amidation reaction occurs represents a particularly surprising aspect of the invention since the reaction of amines with carboxylic acid esters is normally a slow process and often requires, for example, the use of a high concentration of amines (the equivalent of high pressure in the case of ammonia), and/or high temperatures and/or activating agents and/or catalysts. The combination of this amidation reaction and the subsequent reaction with an electrophile is especially advantageous in the synthesis of peptides (in formula 1, X stands for NR3R4, wherein NR3R4 stands for an amino acid ester, an amino acid amide, an amino nitrile or for an N-terminus of a peptide. The peptide might be bound, for example, to a . solid phase resin). This is especially advantageous, since the reaction of the amino group of amino acid derivatives or of peptides with carboxylic acid esters is normally particularly slow.<br>
In a special aspect of the invention, the compound of formula 4 and the compound of formula 5 are the same. In this case, the compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for NR3R4, -wherein R3 stands for H and R4 stands for HCR1R2, -wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above-, can be prepared directly by reacting the compound of formula 3 with the compound of formula 4.<br>
In the preparation of a compound of formula 2, a masked aldehyde group is defined as a group which performs a similar function as an aldehyde group in this preparation or which can form an aldehyde group in situ. Examples of masked aldehyde groups include: hydrates, hemiacetals, (cyclic)acetals and bisulfite adducts.<br>
Examples of solvents for the preparation of a compound of formula 2 wherein X stands for OR5 and R5 is as defined above include hydrocarbon solvents, for example toluene; halogenated solvents, for example dichioromethane; dialkyl ethers,<br><br>
for example methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane; carboxylic acid esters, for example n-butyl acetate, /-propylacetate, ethylacetate; ketones, for example butanone or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); alcohols, for example f-butanol. Preferably, temperatures for the preparation of a compound with formula 2 wherein X stands for OR6 and R5 is as defined above are from 0-150°C, more preferably from 0-120°C, most preferably from 0-60°C.<br>
An a-amino carbonyl compound of formula 1, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above, may be further reacted, for example, with an amine of formula 5,<br>
  (5)<br>
wherein R3and R4 are as defined above to form the corresponding α-amino carbonyl compound of formula 1 wherein X stands for NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above. This is a very favorable reaction as usually hardly any side product formation occurs. Preferably in this conversion, R5 stands for methyl as this gives a facile conversion.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula 2, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above, or of a compound of formula 1, wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above, into a compound of formula 2, or, respectively, into a compound of formula 1, wherein X stands for NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above can either be carried out in the neat amine of formula 5 or in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol or /sopropanol; carboxylic acid esters, for example ethyl acetate, /sopropyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; ketones, for example butanone or MIBK; ethers, for example methyl tert-butyl ether; halogenated solvents; and hydrocarbons, for example toluene. Preferably, the temperature for these conversions is from 0-120°C.<br>
An a-amino carbonyl compound of formula 1 may be further converted, for example, to form the corresponding compound of formula 6 or a salt thereof<br><br>
  (6)<br>
wherein A stands for OH or X and wherein X and E are as defined above, in a manner known per se.<br>
There are several ways known by the person skilled in the art to achieve the conversion of an α-amino carbonyl compound of formula 1 into the corresponding compound of formula 6 or a salt thereof. Examples include reactions carried out under acidic, neutral and basic conditions. Conversion under acidic conditions can, for example, be performed with an aqueous mineral acid, for example 0.2 -1 M HCl solution at ambient temperature, solution of concentrated aqueous HCI in acetone or with an organic acid in an aqueous solvent, for example 15% citric acid in water. Conversion under basic conditions can, for example, be performed by transimination, for example using a solution of hydroxylamine HCI. Examples of each procedure can be found in M. 0'DonnelI, Aldrichimica Acta (2001) 34t 3-15 and references therein. If R1 and/or R2 stand(s) for aryl, conversion under neutral conditions can, for example, be performed by hydrogenolysis, for example using a Pd/C catalyst in the presence of either hydrogen gas or ammonium formate. In the latter case, the conversion of a compound of formula 1 to the corresponding amino acid derivative of formula 6, may, for example, in the case that R1 and/or R2 stand for aryl, be achieved in a two-step process, for example by reducing the imine using NaBH4 (optionally in combination with CoCI2) and subsequent hydrogenolysis. An example of this two-step process is described by EJ. Corey, Org. Lett. (2000) 2,1097-1100.<br>

Ornithine may subsequently be converted to citrulline or arginine.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 or of formula 6 form excellent substrates for resolution procedures. Resolution procedures are procedures for the separation of enantiomers aimed to obtain an enantiomericaily enriched compound.<br>
Various methods known in the art may be employed for the resolution of a compound of formula 1 or of formula 6, For instance, a compound of formula 1 or of formula 6 can be resolved by crystallization induced resolutions, by resolutions via diastereoisomeric salt formation (classical resolutions) or entrainment, for example as described in J. Jacques, A. Collet, S.H. Wilen; 'Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions', Wiley Interscience, New York (1981). Resolutions can also be achieved, for example, by physical separation methods, for example chiral simulating moving bed as described in 'Chiral Separation Techniques', G. Subramanian (Ed.), Wiley, New York (2001), pp 221-251 and 253-285; A. Vande Wouwer, AlChE Journal (2000) 46, 247-256; M. Morbidelli, J Chromatography A (2001) 919t 1-12; and in E. Francotte, Chirality (2002) 14, 313-317. Resolutions can also be achieved, for example, by enzymatic resolutions.<br>
Examples of enzymes which can be used in the enzymatic resolution of compounds of formula 6 wherein X stands for OR5, wherein R5 is as defined above are stereoselective lipases, for example esterases, for example a-chymotrypsin and subtilisin (alcalase) (for example as described in Can. J. Biochem. (1971) 49, 877 and in 'Enzym Catalysis in Organic Synthesis', vol II, K. Drauz, H. Waldmann (Eds.), VCH, Weinheim (2002), pp 398-412).<br>
Examples of enzymes which can be used in the enzymatic resolution of compounds of formula 6 wherein X stands for NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above are stereoselective amino peptidases or stereoselective amidases. For example, the amino peptidase from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 or the arnidase from Ochrobactrum anthropi miBC 40321 (for example described in 'Stereoselective Biocatalysis', R. N. Patel (ed.), Marcel Dekker Inc., New York (2000), pp 23-58), may be used on compounds of formula 6 wherein R3 stands for H and wherein R4 stands for H or an alkyl of 1-4 C-atoms, which alkyl may optionally be substituted or wherein R4 stands for an amino acid, an amino acid amide or an N-terminus of a peptide. The peptide might be bound, for example, to a solid phase resin. For example, R4 stands for<br><br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, hydroxyethyl.<br>
Enzymatic resolution may also be performed by stereoselective N-acylation of compounds of formula 6. Or alternatively, a compound of formula 6 may be acylated, after which enzymatic resolution of the formed acylated form of the compound of formula 6 is carried out by a stereoselective acyl hydrolysis reaction. Suitable enzymes in these cases include for example acyl hydrolases also known as acylases, for example penicillin G acylases and Acylase I (for example as described by A. Romeo, J. Org. Chem. (1978) 43, 2576-2581; and in 'Enzym Catalysis in Organic Synthesis', vol II, K. Drauz, H. Waldmann (Eds.), VCH, Weinheim (2002), pp 716-760), peptide deformylases (for example as described in EP 1141333) and carbamoylases (for example as described in 'Enzym Catalysis in Organic Synthesis', vol II, K. Drauz, H. Waldmann (Eds.), VCH, Weinheim (2002), pp 777-792).<br>
Preferably, the resolution of a compound of formula 1 or of a compound of formula 6 is combined with a racemisation process, for example as described by E. Ebbers et a/, Tetrahedron (1997) 53, 9417-9476 in order to obtain a high yield. The racemisation may be performed as a separate process, but is preferably (as is the case in asymmetric transformation or dynamic kinetic resolution) performed in situ. Examples of the combination of the resolution of a compound of formula 6 with a racemisation process are described in D. Kozma, 'CRC Handbook of Optical Resolution via diastereomeric Sait Formation1, CRC Press, Boca Raton (2002), pp40-46; R.S. Ward, Tetrahedron Asymm. (1995) 6,1475-1490; and in S. Caddick, K. Jenkins, Chem Soc. Rev. (1996) 28,447-456.<br>

Then the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give the crude product as a yellow oil in 0.91 g (3.5 mmol, 68%) yield as a 60:40 diastereomeric mixture. 1H-NMR (CDCI3, 300 MHz), S (ppm): 7.78 (m, 2H, ortho C6H5), 7.34 (m, 3H, meta and para C6H5), 4.36 and 4.18 (2xd, 1Hf CHC02CH3), 3.67 (st 3H, OCH3), 2.70-2.35 (m, 3H, CHChUCN), 2.26 and 2.21 (2xs, 3H, CH3CPh), 1.16 and 1.12 (2xd, 3Ht CHCHCH3).<br><br>
To a suspension of N-benzydryl-glyoxylic acid imine amide (25.0g, 105 mmol) in CH2CI2 (250 ml), is added a 32% NaOH solution (262 g, 2.1 mol, 20 eq.) and Bu4N+HS04' (3.56 g, 10.5 mmol, 0.1 eq.) at room temperature. Then diphenylmethylbromide (28.5 g, 115 mmol, 1.1 eq.) is added in one portion. The mixture is vigorously stirred at room temperature until complete conversion (3.5 h). Then the reaction mixture is diluted with water (250 ml) and with CH2CI2 (750 ml). The phases are separated and the organic layer is washed 3 times with water (150 ml<br><br>
each) and with an aqueous saturated solution of ammonium chloride (150 ml). The organic layer is concentrated in vacuo at 40°C to dryness. The remaining compound (46.9g) is suspended in acetone (105 ml), then concentrated aqueous HCI (37%, 20.7 g, 210 mmol, 2 eq.) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until complete conversion (2-3 h), then the precipitate is filtered off. The product is dried at 40°C under vacuo to constant weight to yield 23.1g (79.5%) of a white powder<br>
