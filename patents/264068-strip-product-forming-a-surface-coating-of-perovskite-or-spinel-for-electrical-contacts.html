				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present disclosure relates to a strip product to be used for manufacturing of electrical<br>
contacts, especially for use at high temperatures and in corrosive environments. The strip<br>
product consists of a metallic substrate, such as stainless steel, and a coating, which in turn<br>
comprises at least one metallic layer and one reactive layer. The coated strip product is<br>
produced by depositing the different layers and thereafter oxidising the coating to<br>
accomplish a conductive surface layer comprising perovskite and/or spinel structure.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Electrical contacts are used in a large variety of environments. Several factors may affect<br>
the electrical contact. One example of a factor that may greatly affect the electrical contact<br>
is a corrosive environment. If the contact material is corroded, for example by oxidation,<br>
the contact resistance is usually affected negatively. Corrosion products, like for example<br>
electrically insulating oxides or other insulating compounds, lower the surface<br>
conductivity of the contact. This in turn results in a lower efficiency of the component of<br>
which the electrical contact makes a part.<br>
Another example of a factor that affects the material of an electrical contact is the<br>
temperature. The contact may suffer from insufficient mechanical strength or may even<br>
weld together due to high temperature. Also, wear may affect the properties of the<br>
electrical contact. Furthermore, differences in thermal expansion between different<br>
elements in an electrical device may cause thermal stress between the contact material and<br>
its adjacent elements, especially if the contact is exposed to thermal cycling.<br>
Naturally, high temperature in combination with a corrosive environment can have an<br>
even more detrimental effect on the surface conductivity of the contact material.<br>
Examples of where electrical contact materials may experience high corrosivity and high<br>
temperatures are in spark plugs, electrodes, waste, coal or peat fired boilers, in melting<br>
furnaces, in vehicles (especially close to the engine), or in industrial environments etc.<br>
2<br><br>
Another example of an electrical contact, which is used at high temperatures and in a<br>
corrosive environment, is interconnects for fuel cells, especially Solid Oxide Fuel Cells<br>
(SOFC). The interconnect material used in fuel cells should work as both separator plate<br>
between the fuel side and the oxygen/air side as well as current collector of the fuel cell.<br>
For an interconnect material to be a good separator plate the material has to be dense to<br>
avoid gas diffusion through the material and to be a good current collector the interconnect<br>
material has to be electrically conducting and should not form insulating oxide scales on<br>
its surfaces.<br>
Interconnects can be made of for example graphite, ceramics or metals, often stainless<br>
steel. For instance, ferritic chromium steels are used as interconnect material in SOFC,<br>
which the two following articles are examples of: "Evaluation of Ferrite Stainless Steels as<br>
Interconnects in SOFC Stacks" by P.B. Friehling and S. Linderoth in the Proceedings Fifth<br>
European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum, Lucerne, Switzerland, edited by J. Huijsmans<br>
(2002) p. 855; "Development of Ferritic Fe-Cr Alloy for SOFC separator" by T. Uehara,<br>
T. Ohno &amp; A. Toji in the Proceedings Fifth European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum,<br>
Lucerne, Switzerland, edited by J. Huijsmans (2002) p. 281.<br>
In a SOFC application the thermal expansion of the interconnect material must not deviate<br>
greatly from the thermal expansion of the electro-active ceramic materials used as anode,<br>
electrolyte and cathode in the fuel cell stack. Ferritic chromium steels are highly suitable<br>
materials for this application, since the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of ferritic<br>
steels are close to the TECs of the electro-active ceramic materials used in the fuel cell.<br>
An electrical contact material used as interconnect in a fuel cell will be exposed to<br>
oxidation during operation. Especially in the case of SOFC, this oxidation may be<br>
detrimental for the fuel cell efficiency and lifetime of the fuel cell. For example, the oxide<br>
scale formed on the surface of the interconnect material may grow thick and may even<br>
flake off or crack due to thermal cycling. Therefore, the oxide scale should have a good<br>
adhesion to the interconnect material. Furthermore, the formed oxide scale should also<br>
have good electrical conductivity and not grow too thick, since thicker oxide scales will<br>
lead to an increased internal resistance. The formed oxide scale should also be chemically<br>
resistant to the gases used as fuels in a SOFC, i.e., no volatile metal-containing species<br>
3<br><br>
such as chromium oxyhydroxides should be formed. Volatile compounds such as<br>
chromium oxyhydroxide will contaminate the electro-active ceramic materials in a SOFC<br>
stack, which in turn will lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the fuel cell. Furthermore,<br>
in the case the interconnect is made out of stainless steel, there is a risk for chromium<br>
depletion of the steel during the lifetime of the fuel cell due to diffusion of chromium from<br>
the centre of the steel to the formed chromium oxide scale at its surface.<br>
One disadvantage with the use of commercial ferritic chromium steel as interconnect in<br>
SOFC is that they usually are alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and/or silicon,<br>
which will form AI2O3 and SiO2, respectively, at the working temperature of the SOFC.<br>
These oxides are both insulating, which will increase the electrical resistance of the cell,<br>
which in turn will lead to a lowering of the fuel cell efficiency.<br>
One solution to the problems that arise when using ferritic steels as interconnect material<br>
for SOFC are the use of ferritic steels with very low amounts of Si and Al in order to avoid<br>
the formation of insulating oxide layers. These steels are usually also alloyed with<br>
manganese and rare earth metals such as La. This has for instance been done in patent<br>
application US 2003/0059335, where the steel is alloyed (by weight) with Mn 0.2 - 1.0%,<br>
La 0.01 - 0.4%, Al less than 0.2% and Si less than 0.2%. Another example is in patent<br>
application EP 1 298 228 A2 where the steel is alloyed (by weight) with Mn less 1.0%, Si<br>
less 1.0%, Al less 1.0%, along with Y less 0.5%, and/or rare earth metals (REM) less<br>
0.2%.<br>
In patent application US 6 054231 a superalloy, defined as a austenitic stainless steel,<br>
alloys of nickel and chromium, nickel based alloys or cobalt based alloys, is first coated<br>
with either Mn, Mg or Zn and then with a thick layer, 25 to 125 (am of an additional metal<br>
from the group Cu, Fe, Ni, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Ir or Rh. The coating of a thick second layer of<br>
an expensive metal such as Ni, Ag or Au is not a cost productive way of protecting already<br>
relatively expensive base materials such as superalloys.<br>
US2004/0058205 describes metal alloys, used as electrical contacts, which when oxidised<br>
forms a highly conductive surface. These alloys can be applied onto a substrate, such as<br>
steel. The conducting surface is accomplished by doping of one metal, such as Ti, with<br>
4<br><br>
another metal, such as Nb or Ta. Furthermore, the alloys according to US2004/0058205<br>
are applied onto the surface in one step and thereafter oxidised.<br>
None of the cited prior art provides a satisfactory electrical contact material for use in<br>
corrosive environments and/or at high temperatures which is produced in a cost-effective<br>
manner and with a high possibility of controlling the quality of the conductive surface.<br>
Therefore, it is a primary object to provide a strip material with a low surface resistance<br>
and that is corrosion resistant, to be used in an electrical contact.<br>
Another object is to provide a material, which will maintain its properties during operation<br>
for long service lives, to be used in electrical contacts.<br>
A further object is to provide material that has a good mechanical strength, even at high<br>
temperatures, to be used as electrical contacts in corrosive environments.<br>
Another object is to provide a cost-effective material for electrical contacts.<br>
Summary<br>
A strip substrate of a metallic material, preferably stainless steel, more preferably ferritic<br>
chromium steel, is provided with a coating comprising at least one layer of a metallic<br>
material and at least one reactive layer. In this context a reactive layer is considered to<br>
mean a layer, which consists of at least one element or compound which forms a spinel<br>
and/or a perovskite structure with the metallic material of the first layer when oxidised.<br>
The strip substrate may be provided with a coating by any method resulting in a dense and<br>
adherent coating. Coating methods may include vapour deposition, such as PVD, in a<br>
continuous roll-to-roll process. Thereafter, electrical contacts are formed of the coated<br>
strip by any conventional forming method, such as punching, stamping or the like. The<br>
electrical contact, consisting of a coated strip, may be oxidised before assembling the<br>
electrical component of which the electrical contact makes a part, or may be oxidised<br>
during operation.<br>

Detailed description<br>
In the present disclosure the words "providing" and "provided" are to be considered<br>
meaning an intentional act and the result of an intentional act, respectively. Consequently,<br>
in this context a surface provided with a layer is intended to be a result of an active action.<br>
A perovskite and/or a spinel structure can be formed on the surface instead of a<br>
"traditional" oxide on metal substrates used as electrical contacts. The purpose of the<br>
perovskite and/or spinel structure is to accomplish a surface with high electrical<br>
conductivity in order to have a surface with a low contact resistance.A coated strip<br>
material is produced by providing a metallic substrate, such as stainless steel, preferably<br>
ferritic chromium steel with a chromium content of 15-30 % by weight. The strip material<br>
substrate is thereafter provided with a coating consisting of at least two separate layers.<br>
One layer is a metallic layer based Al, Cr, Co, Mo, Ni, Ta, W, Zr or an alloy based on any<br>
one of these elements, preferably Cr, Co, Ni, Mo or alloys based on any one of these<br>
elements. In this context "based on" means that the element/alloy constitutes the main<br>
component of the composition, preferably constitutes at least 50 % by weight of the<br>
composition. The other layer is a reactive layer consisting of at least one element or<br>
compound, which forms a perovskite and/or a spinel structure with the element/elements<br>
of the metallic layer when oxidised. The precise composition of the coating can be tailor-<br>
made to achieve wanted properties, for example rate of oxide growth.<br>
One reason for providing the surface with a coating comprising two separate layers, one<br>
being the metallic layer and the other being the reactive layer, is that a much more<br>
6<br><br>
simplified production of the contact material is accomplished. However, the main reason<br>
for by providing a coating with two separate layers is that it is easier to control the amount<br>
of the different elements in the perovskite/spinel, i.e. tailor make the desired composition<br>
in order to achieve the desired result. Furthermore, an excellent adhesion of the coating to<br>
the substrate can be accomplished, thereby improving the properties of the contact<br>
material and hence improving the efficiency and prolonging the service life in the intended<br>
application.<br>
The reactive layer may be located on either side of the layer of a metallic material; i.e.<br>
sandwiched between the substrate and the metallic layer or, on top of the first deposited<br>
metallic layer.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the metallic material consists of essentially pure<br>
Cr or a Cr-based alloy. In this case, when the coating is oxidised a compound with a<br>
formula of MCrO3 and/or MCr2O4 is formed, wherein M is any of the previously<br>
mentioned elements/compounds from the reactive layer. The reactive layer may contain<br>
elements from Group 2 A or 3 A of the periodic system, REM or transition metals. In this<br>
preferred embodiment the element M of the reactive layer preferably consists of any of the<br>
following elements: La, Y, Ce, Bi, Sr, Ba, Ca, Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Fe or mixtures thereof,<br>
more preferably La, Y, Sr, Mn, Ni, Co and or mixtures thereof. One specific example of<br>
this embodiment is one layer of Cr and the other layer being Co.<br>
The reactive layer is obtained by preoxidation of the surface of the metallic base material<br>
according to another preferred embodiment. In the case the metallic base material is a<br>
stainless steel, a chromium oxide will be formed. Thereafter a layer of Ni or Co is<br>
deposited on the formed oxide according to this embodiment.<br>
The coating may also comprise further layers. For example, the coating may comprise a<br>
first metallic layer, thereafter a reactive layer and finally another metallic layer. This<br>
embodiment will further ensure a good conductivity of the surface of the electrical contact.<br>
However, due to economical reasons the coating does not comprise more than separate 10<br>
layers, preferably not more than 5 separate layers.<br>
7<br><br>
The thickness of the different layers are usually less than 20 um, preferably less than 10<br>
um, more preferably less than 5 um, most preferably less than 1 um. The thickness is<br>
preferably adapted to the requirements of the intended use of the electrical contact.<br>
According to one embodiment the thickness of the reactive layer is less than that of the<br>
metallic layer. This is especially important when the reactive layer comprises elements or<br>
compounds that upon oxidation themselves form non-conducting oxides. In this case it is<br>
important that essentially the whole reactive layer/layers are allowed to react and/or<br>
diffuse into the metallic layer at least during operation of the electrical contact, so that the<br>
conductivity of the contact during operation is not affected negatively.<br>
The thickness of the strip substrate may be 5 mm or less, preferably less than 2 mm and<br>
most preferably less than 1 mm. The width of the strip may be up to 1200 mm, preferably<br>
at least 100 mm. Naturally, the thickness has to be adapted to the requirements of the final<br>
application of the electrical contact. One advantage of making a coated strip according to<br>
the present disclosure is that both small and large electrical contacts can be formed from<br>
the strip, for example by stamping or punching. This makes the manufacturing process<br>
more cost-effective. However, in some cases other forms of substrate might be applicable.<br>
One example where the substrate advantageously is in the form of a bar is in the<br>
application of support bars in electrochemical cells. The substrate may also be in form of a<br>
wire or tube if the intended use of the electrical contacts so requires.<br>
The coated strip may be produced in a batch like process or continuous process. However,<br>
for economical reasons, the strip may be produced in lengths of at least 100 m, preferably<br>
at least 1 km, most preferably at least 5 km, in a continuous roll-to-roll process. The<br>
coating may be provided onto the substrate by coating with the metallic layer and the<br>
reactive layer. However, according to an alternative embodiment the coating may also be<br>
provided by pre-oxidation of the substrate to an oxide thickness of at least 50 run and<br>
thereafter coating with the additional layer. The coating is thereafter oxidised further as to<br>
achieve the spinel and/or perovskite. This alternative embodiment of providing the coating<br>
onto the base material is especially applicable when the base material is ferritic chromium<br>
steel, such as the oxide formed on the surface is a chromium based oxide.<br>
8<br><br>
The coating may be performed with any coating process that generates a thin dense<br>
coating with good adhesion to the underlying material, i.e. the substrate or an underlying<br>
coating layer. Naturally, the surface of the strip has to be cleaned in a proper way before<br>
coating, for example to remove oil residues and/or the native oxide layer of the substrate.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the coating is performed by the usage of PVD<br>
technique in a continuous roll-to-roll process, preferably electron beam evaporation which<br>
might be reactive or even plasma activated if needed.<br>
Furthermore, the strip may be provided with a coating on one side or on both sides. In the<br>
case the coating is provided on both surfaces of the strip, the composition of the different<br>
layers on each side of the strip may be the same but may also differ, depending on the<br>
application in which the electrical contact will operate. The strip may be coated on both<br>
sides simultaneously or one side at a time.<br>
Optionally, the coated strip is exposed to an intermediate homogenisation step as to mix<br>
the separate layers and accomplish a homogenous coating. The homogenisation can be<br>
achieved by any conventional heat treatment under appropriate atmosphere, which could<br>
be vacuum or a reducing atmosphere, such as hydrogen or mixtures of hydrogen gas and<br>
inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or helium.<br>
The coated strip is thereafter oxidised at a temperature above room temperature, preferably<br>
above 100 °C, more preferably above 300 °C, so that a perovskite and/or a spinel structure<br>
is formed on the surface of the strip. Naturally, the coating thickness will increase when<br>
the coating is oxidised due to the spinel and/or perovskite formation. The oxidation may<br>
result in a total oxidation of the coating or a partially oxidation of the coating, depending<br>
on for example the thickness of the layers, if the coating is homogenised, and time and<br>
temperature of the oxidation. In either case, the different layers of the coating are allowed<br>
to at least partially react and/or diffuse into each other, if this is not done by an<br>
intermediate homogenisation step. The oxidation may be performed directly after coating,<br>
i.e. before the formation of the electrical contact, after formation to the shape of the final<br>
application, i.e. the manufacturing of the electrical contact from the coated strip, or after<br>
the electrical appliance, for example a fuel cell, has been assembled, i.e. during operation.<br>
9<br><br>
The purpose of accomplishing a perovskite and/or a spinel structure on the surface of the<br>
strip is that the formed perovskite and/or spinel has a much lower resistance compared to<br>
traditional oxides of the elements of the metallic layer. This will in turn lead to a lower<br>
contact resistance of the electrical contact and therefore also a better efficiency of the<br>
component of which the electrical contact makes a part. For example, the resistivity of<br>
Cr2O3 at 800°C is about 7800 Ω-cm while the resistivity of for example Lao.ssSro.15CrO3 is<br>
several orders of magnitude lower, namely about 0,01 Ω-cm.<br>
Also, in the case of chromium containing ternary oxides such as spinel and perovskites it<br>
is believe that these oxides are much less volatile than pure Cr2O3 at high temperatures.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a perovskite and/or spinel structure on the surface of a substrate<br>
such as stainless steel the electrical contact will have good mechanical strength and is less<br>
expensive to manufacture than for example electrical contacts made entirely from a<br>
perovskite and/or spinel based ceramics.<br>
Also, in the case where the substrate is a stainless steel the chromium depletion of the<br>
substrate is inhibited since the metallic layer will oxidise long before chromium of the<br>
substrate, this is especially pronounced when the metallic layer is Cr or a Cr-based alloy.<br>
Therefore, the corrosion resistance of the substrate will not be reduced during operation.<br>
Moreover, according to one optional embodiment Mn and/or REM from the substrate is<br>
allowed to diffuse into the coating. This may in some cases further promote the formation<br>
of a perovskite or spinel structure on the surface. Even small contents of Mn and/or REM<br>
of the substrate may affect the formation of the final structure. The content of Mn in the<br>
substrate is preferably 0.1-5 wt%, the content of REM is preferably 0.01-3 wt% and the<br>
content of Cr in the substrate is preferably 15-30 wt%. Naturally, the needed content of<br>
Mn and/or REM depends on the thickness of the coating. Thicker coatings need higher<br>
contents of Mn and/or REM. For example, if the coating is less than 2 um a content of 0.1-<br>
1 wt% Mn is sufficient as to achieve the desired result.<br>
In some cases it might be applicable to have one surface of the electrical contact<br>
conductive while the other should be non-conductive, i.e. isolating. In these cases the<br>
10<br><br>
coating as described previously may be applied to one surface and an electrically isolating<br>
material such as AI2O3 or SiCh may be applied to the other surface. This may be done in-<br>
line with the electrically conductive coating. According to one example a coating<br>
comprising one metallic layer and one reactive layer is provided to one surface of the strip<br>
and a metal which will form an insulating layer when oxidised, such as for example Al, is<br>
be applied to the other surface of the strip. The coated strip is thereafter oxidised resulting<br>
in one conductive surface and one insulating surface.<br>
As an alternative to the above-described, one might apply the coating by other processes,<br>
for example by co-evaporation of the different components of the coating or by<br>
electrochemical processes.<br>
Examples of coated strips will now be described. These should not be seen as limiting but<br>
merely of illustrative nature.<br>
Example 1<br>
A stainless steel substrate is coated with a coating consisting of a metallic layer and a<br>
reactive layer. The metallic layer is a Cr or a Cr-based alloy. The reactive layer in this case<br>
includes transition metals, such as Ni, Co, Mn and/or Fe, if the oxide should receive a<br>
spinel structure. If a perovskite structure is desired, the reactive layer contains elements<br>
from Group 2A or 3 A of the periodic system, or REM. Preferably, the reactive layer<br>
contains Ba, Sr, Ca, Y, La and/or Ce. If a mixed structure including both a spinel and a<br>
perovskite structure, the reactive layer may contain elements from Group 2 A or 3 A of the<br>
periodic system, or REM along with transition metals. Alternatively, Mn and/or REM are<br>
allowed to diffuse from the substrate.<br>
The coating is optionally homogenised and thereafter oxidised so as to form the desired<br>
structure on the surface. This results in a very low surface resistance of the strip substrate.<br>
Also, the Cr-oxides MCrCh and/or MCr2O4 formed during oxidation are less volatile than<br>
pure Cr2O3 at high temperatures. This results in a coated strip that is highly suitable to be<br>
used as contact material in corrosive environments even at high temperatures, for example<br>
as interconnects in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.<br>
11<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A 0.2 mm thick strip substrate of a ferritic chromium stainless steel was coated. The<br>
coating was homogenised so as to achieve a CrM layer wherein M is a mixture of La and<br>
Mn. The concentration of Cr in the coating is approximately 35-55 wt%, while the<br>
concentration of Mn is approximately 30-60 wt% and the concentration of La is 3-4 wt%.<br>
The surface was analysed by Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES).<br>
Using this technique, it is possible to study the chemical composition of the surface layer<br>
as a function of the distance from the surface. The method is very sensitive for small<br>
differences in concentration and has a depth resolution of a few nanometres. The result of<br>
the GDOES analysis of a 1.5 um thick CrM surface alloying layer is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Two samples of a ferritic chromium steel with the nominal composition, by weight max<br>
0.050 % C; max 0.25 % Si; max 0.35 % Mn; 21-23% Cr; max 0,40 % Ni; 0.80-1.2 % Mo;<br>
max 0.01 % Al; 0.60 - 0.90 % Nb; small additions of V, Ti and Zr and natural occurring<br>
impurities were manufactured. One of the samples was coated with a 0.1 urn thick cobalt<br>
layer and a 0.3 urn thick chromium layer. The samples were oxidised in air at 850 °C for<br>
168 hours prior to the analysis. The samples were analysed by Grazing Incidence X-Ray<br>
Diffraction (GIXRD) with an incidence angel of 0.5 °, see figure 2. It should be pointed<br>
out that GIXRD is a surface sensitive diffraction method and only the crystalline phase of<br>
the top layer on the oxidised steel is analysed. Any crystalline phase present under the top<br>
layer which is not reached by the grazing X-rays will not be seen in the diffractogram. The<br>
amount of spinel vs. chromium oxide formed in the top layer of the oxide scale of each<br>
sample were compared by measuring the peak to bottom intensity of the Cr2O3 (Eskolaite)<br>
reflection at 2 theta = 36.7 ° (3) and diving it by the intensity of the spinel reflection at 2<br>
theta « 45 ° (4). The ratio of Eskolaite /spinel for the uncoated oxidised samples was 9.9<br>
while for the coated sample the ratio was 1.0. This could be interpreted as a ten-fold<br>
increase of spinel structure in the surface oxide scale formed. In figure 2 the (1)<br>
12<br><br>
diffractogram is the uncoated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C and the (2)<br>
diffractogram is the coated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C.<br>
Example 4<br>
Three samples of a ferritic chromium steel with the nominal composition, by weight max<br>
0.050 % C; max 0.25 % Si; max 0.35 % Mn; 21-23% Cr; max 0,40 % Ni; 0.80-1.2 % Mo;<br>
max 0.01 % Al; 0.60 - 0.90 % Nb; small addition of V, Ti and Zr and normally occurring<br>
impurities were manufactured. Two of the samples were pre-oxidised in air to get a 100<br>
run thick oxide scale. The pre-oxidised samples were thereafter coated with a metallic<br>
layer. The metallic layer on sample 2 was a 300 nm thick Ni layer and on sample 3 a 300<br>
nm thick Co layer. All three samples were then further oxidised in air at 850 °C for 168<br>
hours prior to the analysis. The samples were analysed by Grazing Incidence X-Ray<br>
Diffraction (GIXRD) with an incidence angel of 0.5 °, see figure 3. It should be pointed<br>
out that GIXRD is a surface sensitive diffraction method and only the crystalline phase of<br>
the top layer on the oxidised steel is analysed. Any crystalline phase present under the top<br>
layer which is not reached by the grazing X-rays will not be seen in the diffractogram. The<br>
amount of spinel vs. chromium oxide formed in the top layer of the oxide scale of each<br>
sample were compared by measuring the peak to bottom intensity of the Cr2O3 (Eskolaite)<br>
reflection at 2 theta = 36.7 ° (4) and diving it by the intensity of the spinel MCr2O4<br>
reflection at 2 theta « 45 ° (5). The ratio of Cr2O3 /MCr2O4 for the uncoated oxidised<br>
samples was 9.9 while for the pre-oxidised sample with the Ni layer the ratio was 1.26 and<br>
for the pre-oxidised sample with the Co layer the ratio was 0.98. This indicating an 8.5,<br>
respective 10 folded increase of spinel structure in the formed oxide scale. Interesting to<br>
note here is that the nickel layer does not only form more spinel oxide in the scale but also<br>
NiO is formed when the sample has been oxidised (6). In figure 3 the (1) diffractogram is<br>
the uncoated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C, the (2) diffractogram is the<br>
pre-oxidised sample with a Ni layer sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C and the<br>
(3) diffractogram is the pre-oxidised sample with a Co layer sample oxidised in air for 168<br>
hours at 850°C.<br>
