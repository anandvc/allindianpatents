INJECTION MOLDING PROCESS, APPARATUS AND<br>
MATERIAL FOR FORMING CURED-IN-PLACE GASKETS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a process for forming<br>
a cured-in-place gasket by liquid injection molding. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a low pressure<br>
and room temperature process for forming a cured-in-place gasket<br>
by liquid injection molding.<br>
Brief Description Of Related Technology<br>
[0002]	Cured-in-place gaskets have been formed by liquid<br>
injection of a gasket-forming material into a mold. Typical<br>
processes include the use of high temperature and/or high<br>
pressure liquid injection. For example, a typical process is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,597,523 to Sakai et al. The<br>
molding process and molding device requires use of both an<br>
elevated pressure of 24,500 kPa (3,500 psig) and an elevated<br>
temperature of 250°C (480°F). Upper and lower molds are mated<br>
to one to define a mold cavity therebetween. Liquid gasket<br>
material, such as epoxy resin or plastic rubber, is pumped into<br>
a mold cavity at 2,900 kPa (430 psig). The molds and the gasket<br>
material are heated to about 250°C (480°F). The gasket material<br>
in pumped into the mold cavity. The molds are then clamped<br>
together at the elevated pressure of 24,500 kPa (3,500 psig).<br>
After the gasket material is cured, the molds and the gasket are<br>
 <br>
- 2 -	PATENT<br>
LC-539/PCT<br>
cooled to room temperature. The process is described as<br>
requiring about one minute to inject and cure the gasket<br>
material- The use of such elevated pressures and temperatures<br>
at such short cycle times, however, require the use of metallic<br>
molds that can withstand such large fluctuations in pressure and<br>
temperature while maintaining close tolerances to form the<br>
gasket, which make the apparatus and the process expensive and<br>
difficult to operate.<br>
[0003] U.S. Patent No. 6,387,303 to Jones et al. describes a<br>
molding process and apparatus that avoid the use of elevated<br>
temperatures through the use of a gasket-forming material, which<br>
is curable at room temperature. The molds and the gasket-<br>
forming material is described as being cooled to about 0°C<br>
(32°F) to avoid polymerization of the room-temperature curable<br>
material. The gasket-forming material is described as being a<br>
room-jtemperature curable silicone rubber or an anaerobically<br>
curing acrylate compound, which uses temperature cycling to form<br>
the gasket.<br>
[0004]	Thus, there is need for a method for forming gaskets,<br>
which does not require the use of high pressures and does not<br>
require the cycling of temperatures away from room temperature.<br>
There is also a need for actinic radiation curable compositions<br>
useful to form gaskets under such conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	In one aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
procucing a gasket by liquid injection is provided. The method<br>
comprises the steps of providing an actinic radiation curable<br>
(meth)acrylate-functionalized poly(meth)acrylate composition;<br>
providing an injection mold defining an enclosed gasket-forming<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 3 -	PATENT<br>
cavity and an injection port communicating with the cavity, the<br>
mold comprising actinic radiation-conducting means for<br>
permitting actinic radiation transmission therethrough;<br>
injecting the composition into the mold at temperatures of about<br>
65°C (150°F) or less and a pressure of about 1,030 kPa (150<br>
psig) or less to fill the cavity; and transmitting actinic<br>
radiation through the radiation-conducting means in a sufficient<br>
amount cure the composition in the mold to form a gasket in the<br>
gasket-forming cavity.<br>
[0006]	In another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
actinic radiation conducting means may comprise a mold surface<br>
which transmits actinic radiation directly therethrough to cure<br>
the composition. Desirably, at least a portion of the mold wall<br>
comprises a light-transmitting plastic or glass mold.<br>
[0007]	In still another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
actinic radiation conducting means may comprise radiation-<br>
conducting channels, which conduct radiation through the mold to<br>
the actinic radiation-curing composition. Desirably, the<br>
actinic radiation conducting means comprises optic fibers.<br>
[0008]	Desirably, the injection temperature is from about<br>
10°C (50°F) to about 66°C (150°F). More desirably, the<br>
injection temperature is from about 20°C (68°F) to about 50°C<br>
(120°F), including temperatures from about 20°C (50°F) to about<br>
25°C (77°F). Even more desirably, the injection temperature is<br>
at about room temperature.<br>
[0009]	Desirably, the injection pressure is from about 140<br>
kPa (20 psig) to about 1,030 kPa (150 psig). More desirably,<br>
the injection pressure is less than or equal to about 620 kPa<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 4 -	PATENT<br>
(90 psig), for example, from about 345 kPa (50 psig) to about<br>
620 kPa (90 psig).<br>
[0010]	Desirably, the radiation exposure lasts for about 5<br>
minutes of less and desirably is predominently radiation in the<br>
visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
[0011]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
poly(meth)acrylate composition may comprise a (meth)acrylate-<br>
functionalized poly(acrylate), such as one terminated by<br>
(meth)acrylate and including n-butyl acrylate as a segment of<br>
the backbone.<br>
[0012]	Desirably, the poly(meth)acrylate composition is<br>
extrudable at a rate of about 50 g/minute to about 500 g/minute,<br>
such as through a nozzle having a diameter in the range of about<br>
0.8 mm (1/32 of an inch) to about 9.5 mm (3/8 of an inch), such<br>
as 3.2 mm (1/8 of an inch), at a pressure in the range of about<br>
of about 140 kPa (20 psig) to about 830 kPa (120 psig), such as<br>
of about 690 kPa (90 psig) or less.<br>
[0013]	Desirably, the poly(meth)acrylate composition has a<br>
viscosity of about 100 Pas (10,000 cPs) to about 1,000 Pas<br>
(100,000 cPs).<br>
[0014]	Desirably, the poly(meth)acrylate composition includes<br>
at least one monofunctional monomers present in a combined<br>
amount of about 8% to about 20% by weight of the total<br>
composition.<br>
[0015]	In another aspect of the present invention, a system<br>
for forming a gasket composition at room temperature by low-<br>
pressure liquid injection is provided. The system comprises<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 5 -	PATENT<br>
first and second mold members having opposed mating surfaces,<br>
wherein at least one of the mating surfaces has a cavity in the<br>
shape of a gasket and a port in fluid communication with the<br>
cavity and wherein at least one of the mold members transmits<br>
actinic radiation therethrough; and a source of actinic<br>
radiation, the actinic radiation generated therefrom being<br>
transmittable to the cavity when the opposed mating surfaces are<br>
disposed in substantial abutting relationship.<br>
[0016]	In a further aspect of the present invention, the<br>
second mold member is a part, such as but not limited to a valve<br>
cover or oil pan, where the gasket is adhered by mechanical<br>
and/or chemical means to the second mold member. When the first<br>
mold member is removed from the assembly, the gasket stays in<br>
place on the second mold member to provide a final assembly<br>
comprising the cured gasket and part is present as an integral<br>
gasket assembly. Such an assembly has an advantage over typical<br>
cure-in-place assemblies in that aspect ratios and /or gasket<br>
cross sectional shapes can be controlled or specified. As<br>
compared to press-in-place gaskets, the present invention<br>
eliminates the need to separately form a gasket and subsequently<br>
press or otherwise place the gasket on the part.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0031]	FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a mold 10 useful for<br>
forming cured-in-place gaskets according to the present<br>
invention. The mold 10 includes an upper mold member 12, a<br>
lower mold member 14, and an injection port 16, inter-related as<br>
shown. As depicted in FIG. 4, the injection port 16 is in fluid<br>
communication with the mold cavity 18. Due to the low pressure,<br>
i.e., less than about 690 kPa (100 psi), and low temperature,<br>
i.e., at about room temperature, operation of the present<br>
invention, the mold 10 avoids the need for mold members having<br>
materials suitable for higher pressures and temperatures.. Such<br>
materials, such as stainless steel, are often more expensive and<br>
more difficult to machine or tool into the mold. Desirably, the<br>
mold members 12, 14 of the present invention may suitably be<br>
formed from less expensive materials, such as plastics or<br>
aluminum. The plastics may include thermoformed plastics.<br>
[0032]	As used herein the term "room temperature" and its<br>
variants refer ambient temperature typical of industrial<br>
settings. Such ambient temperatures are often of a greater<br>
range than common usage of the term "room temperature", i.e.<br>
from about 20°C (68°F) to about 25°C (77°F). For example,<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 8 -	PATENT<br>
industrial settings may have ambient temperatures from about<br>
10°C (50°F) to about 40°C (100°F).<br>
[0033]	FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the mold 10 of<br>
FIG. 1 taken along the 2-2 axis. As depicted in FIG. 2, the<br>
upper mold member 12 includes a mold cavity 18. Liquid gasket-<br>
forming compositions may be introduced into the mold cavity 18<br>
via the injection port 16.<br>
[0034]	FIG. 3 is a partial-break-away view of the mold 10 of<br>
FIG. 2. Mold member 12 includes a mating surface 13, and mold<br>
member 14 includes a mating surface 15. The mold members 12 and<br>
14 may be aligned to one and the other, as depicted in FIG. 2,<br>
such that the mating surfaces 13 and 15 are substantially<br>
juxtaposed to one and the other. As depicted in FIG. 3 a gasket<br>
17	is removed from the mold cavity 18 and attached to the mating<br>
surface 15.<br>
[0035]	As depicted in FIG. 4, the top view of the mold cavity<br>
18	is in the shape of a closed perimetric design. Although mold<br>
cavity 18 is depicted as a rounded rectangle in FIG. 4, the<br>
present invention is not so limited and other shaped cavities<br>
may suitably be used. Further, while the cross-sectional shape<br>
of the mold cavity 18 is depicted as being circular or semi-<br>
circular in FIG. 2, the present invention is not so limited and<br>
other cross-sectional shapes may suitably be used. Moreover,<br>
the present invention is not limited to having the mold cavity<br>
18 in only the upper mold member 12, and either or both mold<br>
members 12, 14 may suitably contain the mold cavity.<br>
[0036]	As depicted in FIG. 4, the mold 12 may contain a<br>
second port 20. The second port 20 is in fluid communiccition<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 9 -	PATENT<br>
with the mold cavity 20. The second port 20 may be used to<br>
degas the cavity 18 as it is being filled with the gasket-<br>
forming material. As the gasket-forming material in introduced<br>
into the cavity 18 via the port 16, air may escape via the<br>
second port 20 to degas the mold cavity 20. The size of the<br>
second port 20 is not limiting to the present invention.<br>
Desirably, the size, i.e., the cross-section extent, of the<br>
second port 20 is minimized to allow for the egress of air, but<br>
small enough to limit liquid flow of the gasket-forming material<br>
therethrough. In other words, the size of the second port 20<br>
may be pin-hole sized where air can flow through while<br>
inhibiting substantial flow of liquid gasket-forming material.<br>
Further, the present invention is not limited to the use of a<br>
single port 16 or a single port 20, and multiple ports may be<br>
used for the introduction of the gasket material and/or the<br>
venting of air.<br>
[0037]	FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the mold member 12<br>
taken along the 5-5 axis of FIG. 4. As depicted in FIG. 5, the<br>
injection port 16 may suitably be a cavity or bore in the mold<br>
member 12. The portion of the injection port 16 may be threaded<br>
(not shown) or have a valve (not shown) or a tubing or a hose<br>
(not shown) through which the gasket-forming material may be<br>
delivered.<br>
[0038]	FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the mold member 12<br>
taken along the 6-6 axis of FIG. 4. As depicted in FIG. 6, the<br>
port 20 may suitably be a cavity or bore in the mold member 12.<br>
The portion of the port 20 may have a valve (not shown) for<br>
controlling the egress of air and/or gasket-forming material.<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 10 -	PATENT<br>
[0039]	FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the mold member 12<br>
taken along the 7-7 axis of FIG. 4. The mold cavity 18 is<br>
depicted as extending into the mold member 12 at its mating<br>
surface 13.<br>
[0040]	FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the mold member 12<br>
depicting that the mold member 12 may be made of or may comprise<br>
a transparent material. Desirably, the mold member 12 is<br>
transparent, i.e., transmissible or substantially transmissible,<br>
to actinic radiation, for example ultraviolet (UV) radiation. A<br>
cross-sectional view of the transparent mold member 12 is<br>
depicted in FIG. 9.<br>
[0041]	FIG. 10 is a perspective view of mold member 12'<br>
depicting one or more holes or conduits 24 therethrough. As<br>
depicted in FIG. 11 which is a cross-section view of the mold<br>
member 12', the conduits 24 may extend completely through the<br>
mold member 12'. As depicted in FIGS. 10 and 11, the mold<br>
member 12' need not be made of transparent material as the<br>
conduits 24 may allow the transmission of the curing UV light or<br>
curing actinic radiation (not shown). The present invention,<br>
however, is not so limiting. For example as depicted in FIG.<br>
12, the conduit 24 need not extend entirely through the mold<br>
member 12'. The conduit 24 may extend only partially through<br>
the mold member 12'. Desirably, the portion 12b of the mold<br>
member 12' below the conduit 24 is made of transparent material<br>
to permit the transmission of actinic radiation therethrough.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 12, the remaining portion 12a of the mold<br>
member 12' need not be made of a transparent material. Further,<br>
the present invention is not limited to partially extending<br>
conduits 24 having transparent material 12b proximally located<br>
just at the terminus of the conduit 24. For example, as<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 11 -	PATENT<br>
depicted in FIG. 12, significant portions of the mold member 12'<br>
may comprise transparent material 12b. Desirably, a top portion<br>
15 of, the mold member 12' comprises non-transparent material<br>
12a.<br>
[0042]	A system for delivering actinic radiation is<br>
schematically depicted in FIG. 14. A light source 26 generates<br>
actinic radiation, such radiation in the visible and/or UV range<br>
of the electromagnetic spectrum. The actinic radiation passes<br>
through fiber optic cable 28. The cable 28 may be positionable<br>
within the mold member 12, 12'. The cable 28 may further<br>
include a light guide 30 for releasably securing the light<br>
source or cable 28 with the mold member 12.<br>
[0043]	The present invention provides a method for producing<br>
a gasket by liquid injection. The method includes the steps of<br>
providing an actinic radiation curable (meth)acrylate<br>
functionalized poly(meth)acrylate composition; providing an<br>
injection mold 10 defining an enclosed gasket-forming cavity 18<br>
and an injection port 16 communicating with the cavity 18, the<br>
mold 10 comprising actinic radiation-conducting means for<br>
permitting actinic radiation transmission; injecting the<br>
composition in the mold at temperatures of about 50°C (120°F) or<br>
less and a pressure of about 690 kPa (100 psig) or less to fill<br>
the cavity 18; and transmitting a curable amount of actinic<br>
radiation through the radiation conducting means of the mold 10<br>
to cure the composition into a gasket. The mold 10 may include<br>
at least two members 12, 14, with the two members 12, 14 having<br>
opposed mating surfaces 13, 15. As the composition is pumped or<br>
otherwise pressurized into the mold cavity 18, the composition<br>
may exhibit a higher temperature, i.e., about 50°C (120°F) or<br>
less, than ambient temperature due to frictional considerations.<br>
 <br>
LC-539/PCT	- 12 -	PATENT<br>
Such slightly elevated temperatures are below the thermal<br>
polymerization temperature of the composition.<br>
[0044]	Desirably, the gasket-forming material has an<br>
extrusion rate of about 50 g/min to about 500 g/min through a<br>
3.2 mm (0.125 inch) nozzle at a pressure of about 620 kPa (90<br>
psig). More desirably, the liquid composition has an extrusion<br>
rate of about 100 g/min to about 200 g/min through a 3.2 mm<br>
(0.125 inch) nozzle at a pressure of about 620 kPa (90 psig).<br>
[0045]	The extrusion rate may be determined by industry<br>

material passed through the nozzle1, at 620 kPa (90 psi) after 15<br>
seconds.<br>

difficult to process at the low injection pressure of about 690<br>
kPa (100 psig) or less. Composition with lower extrusion rates<br>
