                                            (Section 10)<br>
A carburetor.<br>
Name: Thakare Sachin Suresh<br>
Address: Pushpanjali, Radha Nagar, Amravati-444603 Maharashtra, India.<br>
Nationality: Indian<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
12 JAN 2007<br><br>
A CARBURETOR<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to the carburetor which is a part of internal combustion petrol engine and used to supply mixture of air and petrol to the engine. These engines are generally used in cars and two-wheelers. This invention proposes a modification in conventional carburetor. The drivers having engines equipped with this modified carburetor can have choice to run his vehicle with maximum economy or maximum power.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION WITH REGARDS TO THE DRAWBACKS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN ART: <br>
Drawbacks of the known system :<br>
Engine Manufacturer has to decide at design time whether this engine is for powerful driving or economic driving. According to this requirement, the position of the fuel jet in the venturi of carburetor is decided at design time. If the driver wants his engine with more pick-up and power or with more mileage he has to go to the mechanic get settings changed according to need.<br>
The driving condition may change at every few minutes. So, while rushing through the traffic driver needs more power and on plane and long road, as speed almost remains constant, the need is of less but consistent power and economic driving.<br>
For maximum power output, the air fuel mixture should be slightly richer than the stoichiometric (chemically calculated) air fuel ratio and for maximum economic output air -fuel ratio should be slightly leaner than the stoichiometric (chemically calculated) air fuel ratio.<br>
Both these requirements are not possible to achieve with same fuel jet setting in the venturi. With current carburetors it is not possible to change this setting in running condition. As shown in fig. l , the venturi part and fuel jet both are fixed. Hence, once the carburetor is manufactured, user cannot do changed in air fuel ratio on hiswish. So in order to remove these defects this modification are proposed through this invention.<br>
2<br><br>
   OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
To  have a carburetor in which driver can adjust the richness of air-fuel mixture at runtime.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
  I claim a carburetor for changing the air fuel ratio as per the requirement of the user comprises: a pipe for accommodating the carburetor, said pipe having a slot on its outer periphery; a venturi being placed and movable inside said pipe, a gap is provided between said pipe and venturi which is filled by lubricant to reduce friction between pipe and venturi, said venturi is having an extended part &amp; said extended part is protruding out of said slot of the pipe; a coupling with lever to impart the venturi movement inside said pipe; a fuel jet being placed and kept either movable or fixed inside said pipe; wherein by moving the venturi inside the pipe by means of coupling or by moving the jet, the relative position of fuel jet and venturi is changed and due to that pressure drop around the fuel jet and fuel quantity coming out of fuel jet changes which finally changes the air-fuel ratio as per the need. Accordingly the invention provides a carburetor consisting of an arrangement to change the relative position of fuel jet and venturi so that fuel coming out of fuel jet will be changed resulting into different air fuel ratio. Here in this description it is achieved by moving the venturi inside the pipe containing the carburetor.<br>
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS OF THE CLAIMED SYSTEM:-<br>
Fig. 1 = Cross-sectional view of conventional carburetor<br>
Fig. 2 = Cross-sectional view of proposed modified carburetor according to present invention.<br>
COMPONENTS OF OLD CARBURETOR<br>
1)	D=Direction of air flow<br>
2)	J=Jet through which fuel is ejected<br>
3)	P=Pipe which encapsulates the whole carburetor<br>
4)	T=Throttle<br>
5)	V= Venturi (cut section)<br>
COMPONENTS OF PROPOSED DESIGN OF CARBURETOR<br>
1)	C= Coupling for imparting venturi movement<br>
2)	E=Extended part attached to the venturi and protruding out of the slot provided<br>
in the pipe of carburetor<br>
3)	D=Direction of air flow<br><br><br><br>
3<br><br>
4)	H=location of pin where lever is Hanged<br>
5)	  J =Jet through which fuel is ejected<br>
6)	L=Lever end<br>
7)	P=Pipe which encapsulates the whole carburetor<br>
8)	g=Gap<br>
9)	T=Throttle<br>
10)	Vl=Venturi which is separated from carburetor pipe with a gap 'g'<br>
Constructional details :-<br>
a) the whole construction of the carburetor is almost similar to a conventional carburetor.<br>
As shown in fig. 2 the only difference is that here, the part which creates venturi(V) is not directly<br>
fixed to the outer pipe(P). But it is movable inside this pipe(P). There will a layer of lubricant<br>
between this venturi(V) and the outer pipe(P) to reduce friction.<br>
The outer part will have a slot through which the block(E) welded to venturi will peep out. This<br>
block is coupled with a lever which is hinged at location H as shown in figure. The coupling is<br>
denoted as C in fig. Driver will move this rod by holding lever L. according to his requirement and<br>
hence will control the location of the venturi (V) which ultimately control the relative position of<br>
venturi and fuel jet.<br>
To change the air-fuel ratio at runtime, this proposed carburetor is going to have a arrangement where we can adjust the relative position of fuel jet and the venturi.<br>
At various relative position of fuel jet and venturi the air pressure drop across the fuel jet is different and so the fuel coming out of jet differs and hence obviously the air fuel ratio also differs. To change the relative position of the jet and venturi we can do two things<br>
1)	keep the venturi pipe fixed and move the jet back and forth<br>
2)	keep the jet fixed and move the part of the pipe which consist of venturi.<br>
As fuel jet pipe is comparatively delicate , so will keep the venturi pipe part moving. To have control over this moving part and to maneuver it properly, we will have a rack and pinion arrangement, there can be various technique to move and control this pipe. The basic claim is on the idea that we can change the air fuel ratio at runtime by varying relative position of fuel jet and venturi.<br>
4<br><br>
RETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Principle of working<br>
If we change the relative position of the fuel jet and the carburetor venturi, the pressure drop around the fuel jet will change and hence the quantity of fuel coming out of the jet will change which will result in change in air fuel ratio.<br>
How it works?<br>
An engine produces its maximum possible power at certain Rotation Per Minute (RPM). When engine starts even if driver gives full throttle it takes some time to attain that RPM. If this modified -carburetor is set with richer fuel to air ratio ,this RPM is attained faster (ie. more pick-up) as compare to carburetor supplying leaner mixture.<br>
Lets assume our vehicle's engine is equipped with this proposed carburetor. Suppose the vehicle is moving from rest. So to have maximum possible acceleration the driver needs maximum possible power from the engine. So he will keep the foot lever associated with venturi in a position which will yield the air fuel ratio corresponding to the maximum power.<br>
When vehicle will take required speed and driver feel that now there is no need of much acceleration and we need power which is sufficient to maintain the current speed only he will place the foot lever in the position which will move the venturi pipe to such a place that relative position of venturi and fuel jet will be so that it will yield the air fuel ratio corresponding to most economical ratio.<br>
When driver pushes the lever, as the other end of lever is connected to the notch attached to the inner pipe having venturi, venturi slides.<br>
This rack is connected to the venturi and hence the venturi is shifted. As the position of the fuel jet is fixed, the relative position of venturi and jet changes. So, the pressure-drop across the jet changes. So the fuel coming out of the jet changes and hence the air fuel ratio changes. Please note that, these changes are occurring at run time and they can be done at steady state also.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This modified carburetor is useful for all those engines which uses carburetor. Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined.<br><br><br>
5<br><br>
I claim a carburetor which is for changing the air fuel ratio as per the requirement of the user and<br>
which comprises:<br>
a pipe for accommodating the carburetor, said pipe having a slot on its outer periphery;<br>
a venturi being placed and movable inside said pipe, a gap is provided between said pipe and<br>
venturi which is filled by lubricant to reduce friction between pipe and venturi, said venturi is<br>
having an extended part &amp; said extended part is protruding out of said slot of the pipe;<br>
a coupling with lever to impart the venturi movement inside said pipe;<br>
a fuel jet being placed and kept either movable or fixed inside said pipe;<br>
wherein by moving the venturi inside the pipe by means of coupling or by moving the jet, the<br>
relative position of fuel jet and venturi is changed and due to that pressure drop around the fuel<br>
jet and fuel quantity coming out of fuel jet changes which finally changes the air-fuel ratio as<br>
per the need.<br><br>

A CARBURETOR<br>
ABSTRACT<br>
A carburetor makes a mixture of air and fuel. This invention of a new carburetor is all about providing the control to driver over richness of air-fuel mixture. To have most economical driving air fuel mixture should be a little bit weaker than chemically calculated air fuel ratio. And to have maximum possible power output from the engine it should be slightly greater than chemically calculated air fuel ratio. The need of power and economy changes according to driving conditions.(e.g. while rushing through traffic we need acceleration &amp; power and on highway at constant speed we will prefer to drive vehicle economically).<br>
One major factor which decide air fuel ratio is relative position of venturi and fuel jet. If we can change this relative position at run time then we can change the air fuel ratio at runtime. We can change this relative position by either moving venturi or fuel jet.<br>
