				<td>TITLE :This invention relates to a device for cleaning teeth and massaging gums.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION : Particularly this invention relates to a device for reducing formation of cavities in teeth and messaging the gums and to keep the gums in proper shape.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION WITH REGARDS TO THE DRAWBACK OF ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN ART : The teeth need to be cleaned thoroughly reguiarly so that not a spec of food particle or food fiber remains in the teeth. Gum needs to be messaged so that it remains in its position and continues to give full support to the teeth. Existing device is a toothbrush having bristles for cleaning teeth. The fine bristles in the toothbrush tend to get in between the teeth and the gums. This tends to poke and lift the gums and the gums tend to recede backwards. This receding of the gums exposes fine pits between teeth where food particles can easily settle in. These food particles if not removed can create cavities. Some time food fiber gets stuck in between the teeth and does not come out easily. This food fiber does not come out easily by brushing with toothbrush. This entangled food fiber starts rotting which can create cavities. Another practice is using toothpick or small sticks or pins to remove the fiber. This practice damages the gum, as it tends to poke or lift the gum from its place. Conventional toothbrush have draw backs in removing food particles and food fiber completely and easily thus resulting in formation of cavities and gaps even after regular use of toothbrush. The toothbrush used presently has another problem of reaching interiors of the teeth and gum. The inner side of the teeth and teeth situated at the ends can not be reached easily. The inner side of the teeth formation is concave in nature where as the toothbrush is straight. As a result many of the teeth in the interior remains stuck with food particles. The sticking of the food particle and food fiber are some of the cause of cavity formation and teeth decay. The cavity in the teeth after some time causes further problem to the teeth. Thus the problem starts with interior teeth easily. It is very common that most of the people after some time starts having problem with<br><br>
teeth situated at the interior of the mouth. There have been attempts in improving the toothbrush design by giving various bends, spring action, swivel joints. But the above shortcoming in the toothbrush is not overcome. It is not possible to massage the gum with toothbrush. Messaging of the gums is very necessary to renew the position of the gums to its original position so that gum covers up the exposed pits and gaps between teeth. Messaging the gum also help in removing food particles which may have got in between the gum and the teeth. Messaging also help the gum to sit tightly on to the gum and thus stopping food particles entering between gum and he teeth.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION: Object of this invention is to offer a much superior yet simple alternative to toothbrush for cleaning teeth and also help in massaging gums simultaneously. Thrust is towards reaching cleaning action to nook and corner of the teeth profile and reducing the chances of damaging the gum. Thrust is also to improving the cleaning efficiency and simultaneously massaging the gum thus ensuring that the gum is messaged regularly along with cleaning of the teeth in a short time in one operation. Messaging the gum is very essential so that gum maintains its profile and do not recede backwards away from the tooth.<br>
A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: According to this invention there is provided a device for cleaning teeth and massaging gums which comprises a soft elastic tubular structure and one end of the soft elastic tubular structure is covered and other end is open so that a finger or a thumb can be inserted tightly into it and<br>
the device to have suitable size so as to fit tightly on to a finger or a thumb and the finger can apply the required pressure on the gum through the device so as to massage the gum and help the device to reach nook and corner of the teeth profile for cleaning teeth and<br>
certain areas of the outer surface of it have fine raised striations in patterns to give mild but very effective rubbing action required for dislodging food particles and food fiber from the teeth as well as from the fine pits between teeth and<br><br>
that these striations are in certain patterns to help in pulling out food fiber that get stuck between the teeth and reduce damage to the gum and<br>
that the tube is of soft elastic material and can be bent by the finger to reach interior of the teeth easily and<br>
that suitable toothpaste can be applied on the striations and the gum can be massaged in suitable direction by the finger to keep the gum fit and healthy and<br>
the device to have suitable thickness to improve longevity and to protect the gum from not being hit by hard portion of the finger and the nail.<br>
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING:<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which, there are five figures numbered Figl, Fig2, Fig3, Fig4 &amp; Fig5.<br>
Fig 1 is the elevation showing the external view of this invention.<br>
Fig2 is showing the cut section of the device of Figl.<br>
Fig 3 is the view from the bottom.<br>
Fig 4 is the external view of the device for all combined fingers and<br>
Fig 5 shows the device when a finger is inserted in to it and during the process of<br>
use.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS: Referring to the drawings, a device for cleaning teeth and massaging gums in accordance with the invention indicated generally by reference numeral<br>
'10'.<br>
The device for cleaning teeth and gums refer '10' consists of a tubular structure with one end of the tube '20' is covered and other end is open '30' so that a finger or a thumb can be inserted tightly into it. Certain areas '40' of the outer side of it have fine raised striations in patterns protruding out. The tubular structure has suitable diameter '50' so that it fits tightly on to the finger. It will also have suitable length '60'. The tube is of suitable thickness '70' ranging from fraction of a millimeter to<br><br>
about 5 millimeter so that it has suitable strength and does not get loosened or gets cut easily. The device will be of various sizes so as to be compatible for each user.<br>
The striations are of suitable patterns. Cleaning compound or toothpaste can be applied on the striations.<br>
The device can also be for all fingers together reference numeral '80*. This type will help nurses, assistants and doctors for cleaning teeth of patients who are unable to clean their own teeth. This type will also help parents, older people for cleaning teeth of kids, children.<br><br>
CLAIMS. I claim :<br>
1.	A device for cleaning teeth and massaging gums which comprises soft elastic<br>
tubular structure refer MO' with one end of the soft elastic tubular structure is<br>
covered refer *20' and other end is open refer '30' so that a finger or a thumb can be<br>
inserted tightly into it and the outer side of the soft elastic tubular structure having<br>
fine striations which are raised strips protruding out refer '40' to give roughness<br>
with desired effect which when rubbed on the surface of the teeth and gums will<br>
