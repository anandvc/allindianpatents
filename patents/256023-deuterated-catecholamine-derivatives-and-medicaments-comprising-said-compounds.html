3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
The invention concerns deuterated catecholamine derivatives as well as pharmaceuticals containing these compounds .<br>
Known representatives of catecholamines, such as L-dopa (levodopa) as well as their carboxylic acid esters, are utilized, among other things, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. Such a pharmaceutical which contains levodopa is, for example, Dopaf- lex®. L-dopa acts on the dopamine concentration in neu- rons of the brain. Unlike dopamine itself, it can pass through the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain.<br>
In addition, levodopa is administered in combination with active additives in pharmaceuticals. Combinations of levodopa are used with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors, with inhibitors of the enzyme catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) , with inhibitors of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and with dopamine p-hydroxylase inhibitors.<br>
In this connection, the decarboxylase inhibitors used are, for example: D,L-serine 2-(2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide (benserazide) , (-)-L-a -hydrazino-3, 4-dihydroxy-a-methylhydrocinnamic acid (carbidopa) , L- serine-2- (2 , 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide, gIycine-2- (2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide and L-tyrosine-2- (2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide. Examples of combination preparations of levodopa and decarboxylase inhibi- tors include, among others: Madopar® (levodopa and ben-serazide hydrochloride) as well as Nacom® (levodopa and carbidopa).<br>
Examples of COMT inhibitors are entacapone (Comtan®) and cabergoline and frequently used MAO inhibitors are selegiline hydrochloride, moclobemide and tranylcypromine.<br>
Calcium 5-butyl picolinate and calcium 5-pentyl picoli- nate are described as inhibitors for dopamine-p- hydroxylase (DE 2,049,115).<br>
WO-A 2004/056724 discloses deuterated catecholamine having two deuterium atoms in the p-position. These compounds exhibit improved pharmacokinetic and/or pharmaco- dynamic properties with respect to undeuterated compounds and as compared to L-DOPA.<br>
An object of the present invention is to prepare deuterated catecholamine derivatives, which have improved phar- macokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties when compared to compounds already known, as well as to prepare catecholamine derivatives, which can be utilized for the prophylaxis of psychoses including schizophrenia, and which can be used for producing pharmaceuticals for the prophylaxis of psychoses.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the deuterated catecholamine derivatives according to the invention have substantially better pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacody- namic properties than the undeuterated compounds and the p, p-di-<br>
2<br><br>
deuterated compounds known in the art and that they can also be utilized for the prophylaxis of psychoses and can be used for producing pharmaceuticals for the prophylaxis of psychoses.<br>
According to the invention, the object is thus solved by the preparation of compounds of general formula I:<br><br>

The production of the compounds according to the invention is known to one skilled in the art. Analogous production methods are used as described, for example, in DE-A102 61 807.<br>
For the production of the physiologically acceptable salts of the deuterated catecholamine derivatives according to the invention, the usual physiologically acceptable inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, salicylic acid, adipic acid and benzoic acid can be used. Additional acids that can be used are described, for example, in Fortschritte der Arzneimittelforschung, Vol. 10, pp. 224- 225, Birkhauser Publishers, Basel and Stuttgart, 1966, and Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 66, pp. 1-5 (1977).<br>
The acid addition salts are usually obtained in a way known in and of itself by mixing the free base or solutions thereof with the corresponding acid or solutions thereof in an organic solvent, for example, a lower alco- hoi, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol or a lower ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone or an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. For better crystal precipitation, mixtures of the named solvents can also be used. In addition, physiologically acceptable aqueous solutions of acid addition salts of the compounds used according to the invention can be produced there from in an aqueous acid solution.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds according to the invention can be converted to the free base in a way known in and of itself, e.g., with alkalis or ion exchangers . Additional salts can be obtained from the free base by reaction with inorganic or organic acids, par- ticularly those which are suitable for the formation of salts that can be employed therapeutically. These or also other salts of the new compound, such as, e.g., the picrate, may also serve for purification of the free base by converting the free base into a salt, separating this salt, and again releasing the base from the salt.<br>
The subject of the present invention is also pharmaceuticals for oral, buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal, subcutaneous, intravenous or intramuscular application as well as for inhalation, which, in addition to the usual vehicle and dilution agents, also contain a compound of general formula I or the acid addition salt thereof as an active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the invention are produced, in the known way and with suitable dosage, with the usual solid or liquid vehicle substances or dilution agents and the usually used pharmaceutical-technical adjuvants corresponding to the desired type of application. The preferred preparations consist of a form of administration which is suitable for oral application. Such forms of administration<br>
11<br><br><br>
include, for example, tablets, sucking tablets, film tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, powders, solutions, aerosols or suspensions or slow-release forms.<br>
Of course, parenteral preparations such as injection solutions are also considered. In addition, suppositories, for example, have also been named as preparations. Corresponding tablets can be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance with known adjuvants, for example, inert dilution agents such as dextrose, sugar, sorbitol, mannitol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, bursting agents such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starches or gelantins, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for achieving a slow-release effect such as carboxypolymethylene, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also consist of several layers.<br>
Dragees can also be produced correspondingly, for con- trolled or delayed release forms of preparation, by coating the cores produced analogously to the tablets with agents commonly used in dragee coatings, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. The dragee envelope may also con- sist of several layers, wherein the adjuvants mentioned above in the case of tablets can be used.<br>
Solutions or suspensions containing the active substance used according to the invention may additionally contain agents that improve taste, such as saccharin, cyclamate or sugar, as well as, e.g., taste enhancers such as vanilla or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoate . Capsules containing active substances can be produced, for example, by mixing the active substance with an inert vehicle such as lactose or sorbitol and encapsulating this mixture in gelatin capsules. Suitable suppositories can be produced, for example, by mixing with vehicle agents provided therefore, such as neutral fats or polyethylene glycol or de- rivatives thereof.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention is known in and of itself, and is described in handbooks known to the person skilled in the art, for example, Hager's Handbuch [Handbook] (5th ed.) 2, 622-1045; List et al., Arzneiformenlehre [Instructions for Drug Forms], Stuttgart: Wiss. Verlagsges. 1985; Sucker et al., Pharmazeutische Technologie [Pharmaceutical Technology], Stuttgart: Thieme 1991; Ullmann's Enzyk- lopadie [Encyclopedia] (5th ed.)

As known from WO-A 2004/056724, L-2-Amino-2,3,3-trideutero-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid is a selectively deuterated L-DOPA derivative with better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties when compared to L-DOPA. Administration of L-2-Amino-2, 3, 3- trideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid to male Wistar rats increased dopamine in the striatum significantly more compared to non-deuterated L-DOPA.<br><br><br>
It has been surprisingly found that L-2-Amino-2, 3- dideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid increased dopamine in the striatum significantly more than L-2-Amino-2/ 3, 3-trideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, although the compound has less deuterium at the beta position of the side chain of its molecule (Example 15 and Table 1).<br>
Furthermore, whereas L-2-Amino-2, 3, 3-trideutero-3- (3, 4- dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid reduces the striatal output of norepinephrine compared to L-DOPA, L-2-Amino-2, 3- dideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid does not block the formation of norepinephrine.<br>
Therefore, L-2-Amino-2, 3-dideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid has two advantages, it provides more dopamine and enough norepinephrine which has been shown to play an important role in compensating for the loss in dopaminergic function (Archer and Fredriksson, 2006, Neural Transm., 113(9): 1119-29; Cathala et al . 2002, Neuroscience, 115(4): 1059-65; Tong et al . 2006, Arch Neurol, 63(12): 1724-8).<br>
The highly soluble' L-DOPA methyl ester has been shown to function as a prodrug of L-DOPA. In animal experiments, L-DOPA methyl ester given orally or intraperitoneally was equivalent on a molar basis to L-DOPA. However, therapeutic equivalence was not maintained with continuous intra- venous infusion in Patients with Parkinson' s disease exhibiting severe on-off phenomena. The optimal infusion rate for L-DOPA methyl ester was 2.7 times that required for L-DOPA (Stocchi et al. 1992, Movement Disorders, 7: 249-256). Surprisingly, L-2-Amino-2, 3-dideutero-3- (3, 4- dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid methyl ester is therapeutically equivalent to L-2-Amino-2, 3-dideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid during continuous intravenous infusion..<br>
The following examples are given to explain the present invention in more detail but shall not be understood to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

2.5 g Levodopa are dissolved in 60 mL CH3CO2D under argon and then reacted with 0.25 mL benzaldehyde under reflux. Following elimination of acetic acid and benzaldehyde by- distillation in vacuum, 2 mL of methanol are added. The product is precipitated slowly with 10 mL ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1). After drying under vacuum, 2.2 g D, L- 2-Amino-2-deutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid are isolated. Yield: 87,6%<br>
Example 2<br>
D,L-2-Amino-2-deutero-3- (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) methyl propionate<br>
2.0 g of D, L-2-Amino-2-deutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid are dissolved in 30 mL methanol and cooled to -10°C and reacted dropwise with 1 ml of thionyl chloride. The reaction batch is then heated to 40' °C for 15     hours. The<br>
13<br><br>
volatile substances in the reaction batch are eliminated in vacuum and 10'ml of water and 15 ml of a solution of 0.8 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate, 1 g of sodium sulfate and 1 mg of ascorbic acid are added. The pH of the solution is adjusted to a value of 7 by addition of a dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The product is transferred to the organic phase by extraction with oxygen-free ethyl acetate, which contains 0.01% 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol . The organic phase is dried and then the solvent is distilled off. 50 ml of oxygen- free diethyl ether axe added to the residue and after this material is left to stand overnight, the D,L-2- amino-2-deutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) methyl propionate precipitates. After recrystallization from an oxygen-free methanol/diethyl ether mixture, which is combined with 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol, 1.8 g of product is isolated. Yield: 84.9%<br>
Example 3<br>
L-2-Amino-2-deutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid<br>
1.15 g of D, L-2-Amino-2-deutero-3- (3,  4-dihydroxyphenyl) methyl propionate are<br>
dissolved in 30 mL of a 0.2-molar sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 8.2) . 200 pL of<br>
alcalase are added and the pH of the solution is kept at this value by means of<br>
carbonate-bicarbonate buffer. The course of the reaction is monitored by HPLC and<br>
the  reaction  is   terminated  by   the  addition  of  hydrochloric   acid  when  the<br>
concentration of the propionate ester has been reduced to one-half. The deuterated<br>
amino acid contained in the solution is separated from the deuterated methyl ester<br>
chromatographically by use of the solvent system of acetonitrile/0.1% aqueous<br>
trifluoroacetic    acid    (15:85)    and    0.51    g    of    L-2-amino-2-deutero-3-    (3,    4-<br>

Striatal dopamine output measured by microdialysis<br>
The striatal output of dopamine was measured in Male Wis- tar rats following intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg L-2-Amino-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (L-DOPA) , L-2-Amino-2, 3, 3-trideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (WO-A 2004/056724, Example 6) and L-2-Amino-2, 3-dideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (Example 6), respectively. Male wistar rats (BK Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) weighing about 300 g at the time of experiment were anaesthetized with a cocktail containing fentanyl citrate (0.39 mg/kg) and fluanisone (12.5 mg/kg, Hypnorm®, Janssen-Cilag) and midazolam (6.25 mg/kg, Dormicum®, Roche) diluted in distilled water (1:1:2; 5 ml/kg i.p.) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. Dialysis probes were implanted in the dorsolateral striatum (AP: +0.6: ML + 3.0: DV -6.2 relative to bregma and the dural surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1998) ) . Dialysis occurs through a semipermeable membrane (Filtral AN69, Hospal Industrie, France) with an active surface length of 3.5 mm. Dialysis experiments were conducted approximately 48 h after surgery in freely moving rats. The rats received 30 min before administration of test items 10 mg/kg Carbidopa, (i.p.). The dialysis probe was perfused with a physiological perfusion solution (Apoteksbolaget, Sweden) at a rate of 2.5ml/min set by a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Hollis- ton, MA). Dialysate was collected over 15 min intervals and automatically injected into a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. On-line quantification of dopamine in the dialysate was accomplished by electrochemical detection (ESA, Chelmsford, MA) . The location of microdialysis probes was verified in slices of formalin- fixed tissue stained with neutral red. The baseline corrected concentrations (fmol/min) were plotted over the time .<br>
Comparison of AUCo-t (area under the curve) values revealed that the increase of dopamine in the striatum following administration of 50 mg/kg L-2-Amino-2, 3, 3-trideutero-3- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid was a- bout twice as high compared to L-2-Amino-3- (3, 4- dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (L-DOPA) as displayed in Table 1. The increase of striatal dopamine following administration of 50 mg/kgL-2-Amino-2, 3-dideutero-3- (3, 4- dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (Example 6) was even threefold higher than that measured after administration of L-DOPA.<br>
