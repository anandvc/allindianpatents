				<td>EIGHT SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WITH DUAL AREA CLUTCH<br>
PISTON<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/942,690, filed June 8,2007, and which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to transmissions having planetary gear arrangements,<br>
torque transmitting devices for selectively coupling members of the planetary gear<br>
arrangements to other members, and pistons partially defining separate pressure<br>
chambers for actuating the torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Certain multi-speed transmissions are characterized by differences in the<br>
amount of torque a clutch is subjected to in various gear states. The torque capacity of a<br>
clutch is, at least in part, determined by the axial force exerted on the clutch plates and<br>
discs by a hydraulically actuated piston. The force of the piston is determined by the<br>
pressure of the hydraulic fluid and the surface area of the piston exposed to the<br>
hydraulic fluid. Thus, the surface area of a clutch piston exposed to hydraulic pressure<br>
must be sized to produce the amount of axial force necessary for the highest torque<br>
condition of the clutch.<br>
[0004]	A clutch with a large torque capacity has a large gain between hydraulic<br>
pressure exerted on the piston and clutch torque. Small errors in pressure control may<br>
result in large clutch torque errors. In speed ratios with lower mechanical gains, the<br>
resulting clutch torque errors can be a significant percentage of the total torque required<br>
to complete a shift.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	A transmission includes an input member, an output member, a<br>
stationary member, and first, second, third, and fourth planetary gearsets. Each of the<br>
gearsets has respective first, second, and third members. The first member of the first<br>
planetary gearset is continuously operatively connected to the first component of the<br>
second planetary gearset for unitary rotation. The second member of the second<br>
planetary gearset is continuously operatively connected to the second member of the<br>
third planetary gearset for unitary rotation. The third member of the first planetary<br>
gearset is continuously operatively connected to the third member of the fourth<br>
planetary gearset for unitary rotation. The first member of the third planetary gearset is<br>
continuously operatively connected to the first member of the fourth planetary gearset<br>
for unitary rotation.<br>
[0006]	The second member of the first planetary gearset is continuously<br>
operatively connected to the input member for unitary rotation. The second member of<br>
the third planetary gearset is continuously operatively connected to the output member<br>
for unitary rotation.<br>
[0007]	The transmission also includes first, second, third, fourth, and fifth<br>
torque transmitting devices that are operative to selectively connect members of the<br>
planetary gearsets with the input member, the stationary member, or with other<br>
members of the planetary gearsets to provide at least eight forward speed ratios. At<br>
least one of the torque transmitting devices includes a piston that partially defines two<br>
separate pressure chambers and that is selectively moveable in response to hydraulic<br>
pressure in the pressure chambers.<br>
[0008]	The transmission provided herein improves upon the prior art because,<br>
where a relatively high amount of torque capacity is required by one of the torque<br>
transmitting devices, both chambers of the piston may be pressurized to provide the<br>
required torque capacity. Where a relatively low amount of torque capacity is required<br><br>
by the torque transmitting device, only one of the chambers may be pressurized,<br>
thereby reducing the amount of torque disturbance resulting from pressure errors.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

hydraulic circuit of the transmission.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015]	Figure 1 shows a lever diagram of a transmission 10 in accordance with<br>
the invention. The mechanisms will be described with specific reference to the stick<br>
diagram of Figure 2, wherein like reference numerals refer to like components from<br>
Figure 1. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the transmission 10 includes a first planetary<br>
gearset 14, a second planetary gearset 18, a third planetary gearset 22, and a fourth<br>
planetary gearset 26. Each of the planetary gearsets 14, 18,22,26 includes respective<br>
first, second, and third members.<br>
[0016]	More specifically, planetary gearset 14 includes a sun gear member 30, a<br>
ring gear member 34, and a planet carrier 38. Planet gears 40 are rotatably mounted with<br>
respect to the planet carrier 38 and are meshingly engaged with the ring gear member 34<br><br>
and the sun gear member 30. Planetary gearset 18 includes a sun gear member 42, a ring<br>
gear member 46, and a planet carrier 50. Planet gears 52 are rotatably mounted with<br>
respect to the planet carrier 50 and are meshingly engaged with the ring gear member 46<br>
and the sun gear member 42. Planetary gearset 22 includes a sun gear member 54, a ring<br>
gear member 58, and a planet carrier 62. Planet gears 64 are rotatably mounted with<br>
respect to the planet carrier 62 and are meshingly engaged with the ring gear member 58<br>
and the sun gear member 54. Planetary gearset 26 includes a sun gear member 66, a ring<br>
gear member 70, and a planet carrier 74. Planet gears 76 are rotatably mounted with<br>
respect to the planet carrier 74 and are meshingly engaged with the ring gear member 70<br>
and the sun gear member 66.<br>
[0017] It should be noted that, where used in the claims, first, second, and third<br>
members of planetary gearsets do not necessarily refer to a member of a particular<br>
type; thus, for example, a first member may be any one of a ring gear member, sun<br>
gear member, or planet carrier assembly member. Similarly, as used in the claims, the<br>
respective first, second, or third members of two or more gearsets may or may not be<br>
the same type of member.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 10 also includes an input member 80 that is continuously<br>
operatively connected to the planet carrier 38 for unitary rotation therewith. An output<br>
member 84 is continuously operatively connected to the planet carrier 62 for unitary<br>
rotation therewith. Sun gear member 30 and sun gear member 66 are continuously<br>
operatively connected to one another for unitary rotation by interconnecting member 88.<br>
Planet carrier 50 and planet carrier 62 are continuously operatively connected to one<br>
another for unitary rotation by interconnecting member 92. Sun gear member 42 and ring<br>
gear member 34 are continuously operatively connected to one another for unitary<br>
rotation by interconnecting member 96. Planet carrier 74 and ring gear member 58 are<br>
continuously operatively connected to one another for unitary rotation by interconnecting<br>
member 100.<br>
[0019]	The transmission 10 also includes a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices that are selectively engageable to couple members of the planetary gearsets with<br>
the input member, the stationary member, or with other members of the planetary<br><br>
gearsets. Torque transmitting device 104 is a clutch that is configured to selectively<br>
couple the input member 80 and planet carrier 38 to ring gear member 54 for unitary<br>
rotation. Torque transmitting device 108 is a clutch that is configured to selectively<br>
couple interconnecting member 96, sun gear member 42, and ring gear member 34 to sun<br>
gear member 54 for unitary rotation. Torque transmitting device 112 is a clutch<br>
configured to selectively couple ring gear member 46 to sun gear member 54 for unitary<br>
rotation. Torque transmitting device 116 is a brake that is configured to selectively<br>
couple interconnecting member 88, sun gear member 30, and sun gear member 66 to a<br>
stationary member, such as transmission housing 118. Torque transmitting device 120 is<br>
a brake configured to selectively couple ring gear member 70 to the housing 118.<br>
[0020]	Referring to Figure 3, a shift logic sequence for torque transmitting<br>
devices 104,108,112, 116, 120 is depicted that provides eight forward speed ratios and<br>
one reverse speed ratio between the input member 80 and the output member 84.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-3, a reverse speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting<br>
devices 116,120, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 108 and 104 are<br>
disengaged.<br>
[0021]	A first forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
116, 120, and 104 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 108 and 112 are<br>
disengaged. A second forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
116,120, and 108 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 104 and 112 are<br>
disengaged. A third forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
120,108, and 104 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 116 and 112 are<br>
disengaged. A fourth forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
120,108, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 116 and 104 are<br>
disengaged. A fifth forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
120,104, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 116 and 108 are<br>
disengaged. A sixth forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
108,104, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 116 and 120 are<br>
disengaged. A seventh forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
116, 104, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 120 and 108 are<br><br>
disengaged. An eighth forward speed ratio is achieved when torque transmitting devices<br>
116, 108, and 112 are engaged and torque transmitting devices 120 and 104 are<br>
disengaged.<br>
[0022]	Referring to Figure 4, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figures 1 and 2, torque transmitting device 120 is schematically<br>
depicted. Torque transmitting device 120 includes a plurality of evenly-spaced pressure<br>
plates 124 operatively connected to the housing 118. Torque transmitting device 120 also<br>
includes a plurality of discs 128 that are spaced apart from one another and operatively<br>
connected to the ring gear member 70. At least part of each plate 124 is disposed<br>
between two discs 128, as understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0023]	The torque transmitting device 120 also includes a piston 132 that is<br>
biased by a return spring, i.e., belleville spring 134, into a disengaged position as shown<br>
in Figure 4. When the piston 132 is in the disengaged position, it does not act on the<br>
plates 124 and discs 128; thus the discs 128 and the ring gear member 70 are free to<br>
rotate with respect to the plates 124 and the housing 118. The piston 132 is selectively<br>
moveable axially into engagement with the plates 124 and discs 128, thereby<br>
compressing the plates 124 and discs 128 together such that the plates 124 and discs 128,<br>
and therefore the ring gear member 70 and the housing 118, cannot rotate with respect to<br>
each other.<br>
[0024]	The surface of the piston 132 is characterized by a first area 136 and a<br>
second area 140. The first area 136 cooperates with transmission structure, 144 to define<br>
a first piston chamber 150, and the second area 140 cooperates with the transmission<br>
structure 144 to define a second piston chamber 154. The first and second chambers 150,<br>
154 are in selective fluid communication with a source of pressurized fluid, such as the<br>
pump (shown at 160 in Figure 4a).<br>
[0025]	More specifically, and with reference to Figures 4 and 4a, valve 164 is<br>
selectively moveable between open and closed positions. When valve 164 is in its open<br>
position, the first chamber 150 is in fluid communication with the pump 160 via conduit<br>
168. When valve 164 is in its closed position, valve 164 prevents fluid communication<br>
between the pump 160 and the first chamber 150. Valve 172 is selectively moveable<br><br>
between open and closed positions. When valve 172 is in its open position, the second<br>
chamber 154 is in fluid communication with the pump via conduit 176. When valve 172<br>
is in its closed position, valve 172 prevents fluid communication between the second<br>
chamber 154 and the pump 160. Valves 164,172 include actuators, such as solenoids, to<br>
cause the valves 164,172 to move between their respective open and closed positions.<br>
The valves 164,172 are operatively connected to a controller 180 to be controlled<br>
thereby.<br>
[0026]	The transmission structure 144 defines three axially oriented surfaces 184,<br>
188, 192. The piston 132 includes three axially oriented surfaces 196,200,204.<br>
Surfaces 184 and 196 are positioned to remain in contact with one another during axial<br>
translation of the piston 132; surfaces 188 and 200 are positioned to remain in contact<br>
with one another during axial translation of the piston 132; and surfaces 192 and 204 are<br>
positioned to remain in contact with one another during axial translation of the piston<br>
132.<br>
[0027]	Chamber 150 is sealed by the contact between surfaces 184 and 196, and<br>
by contact between surfaces 188 and 200. Chamber 154 is sealed by contact between<br>
surfaces 188 and 200 and by contact between surfaces 192 and 204. Seals (not shown)<br>
may be employed between surfaces 184, 188, 192, 196, 200, 204 to further seal the first<br>
and second chambers 150, 154. The first and second chambers 150, 154 are not in fluid<br>
communication with one another; that is, fluid or fluid pressure from conduit 168 affects<br>
the first chamber 150 but not the second chamber 154. Similarly, fluid or fluid pressure<br>
from conduit 176 affects the second chamber 154 but not the first chamber 150.<br>
Accordingly, the first and second chambers 150, 154 may be separately and<br>
independently pressurized by the controller 180.<br>
[0028]	More specifically, by opening valve 164 and maintaining valve 172 in its<br>
closed position, the controller 180 causes the first chamber 150 to be pressurized while<br>
the second chamber 154 remains unpressurized. By opening valve 172 and maintaining<br>
valve 164 in its closed position, the controller 180 causes the first chamber 150 to remain<br>
unpressurized while the second chamber 154 is pressurized. The controller causes<br><br>
concurrent pressurization of both chambers 150, 154 by causing both valves 164, 172 to<br>
be concurrently open.<br>
[0029]	The first area 136 is arranged such that pressure in chamber 150 acts on<br>
the first area 136 to overcome the bias of the belleville spring 134 and move the piston<br>
132 axially into engagement with the plates 124 and discs 128. Similarly, the second<br>
area 140 is arranged such that pressure in chamber 154 acts on the second area 140 to<br>
overcome the bias of the belleville spring 134 and move the piston 132 axially into<br>
engagement with the plates 124 and discs 128.<br>
[0030]	Pressurizing only one of the chambers 150, 154 results in less piston force,<br>
and therefore less torque capacity of the torque transmitting device 120, than pressurizing<br>
both of the chambers 150, 154. A given amount of pressure error with only one of the<br>
chambers 150, 154 pressurized results in a smaller amount of torque disturbance than<br>
the same amount of pressure error subjected to both chambers 150, 154.<br>
[0031]	Torque transmitting devices 116 and 112 are similar to torque transmitting<br>
device 120 in having respective pistons with separate chambers that may be separately<br>
and independently pressurized by controller 180. As shown in Figure 3, relatively high<br>
torque capacity is required from torque transmitting device 116 for the reverse and first<br>
speed ratios, and relatively low torque capacity is required from torque transmitting<br>
device 116 for the second, seventh, and eighth speed ratios. Relatively high torque<br>
capacity is required from torque transmitting device 120 for the reverse, first, second and<br>
third speed ratios, and relatively low torque capacity is required from torque transmitting<br>
device 120 for the fourth and fifth speed ratios. Relatively high torque capacity is<br>
required from torque transmitting device 112 for the reverse speed ratio, and relatively<br>
low torque capacity is required from torque transmitting device 112 for the fourth, fifth,<br>
sixth, seventh, and eighth speed ratios.<br>
[0032]	Where a relatively high torque capacity is required from any of torque<br>
transmitting devices 116, 120, 112, the controller 180 is programmed to pressurize both<br>
piston chambers of the torque transmitting device. Where a relatively low torque<br>
capacity is required from any of torque transmitting devices 116, 120, 112, the<br><br>
controller 80 is programmed to pressurize only one of the piston chambers of the torque<br>
transmitting device.<br>
[0033]	More specifically, both of the chambers of the piston of torque<br>
transmitting device 116 are pressurized in the reverse and first speed ratios, and only<br>
one of the chambers of the piston of torque transmitting device 116 is pressurized while<br>
shifting into the second, seventh, and eighth speed ratios. Both of the chambers 150,<br>
154 of the piston 132 of torque transmitting device 120 are pressurized in the reverse,<br>
first, second, and third speed ratios, and only one of the chambers 150, 154 of the<br>
piston 132 of torque transmitting device 120 is pressurized while shifting into the fourth<br>
and fifth speed ratios. Both of the chambers of the piston of torque transmitting device<br>
112 are pressurized in the reverse speed ratio, and only one of the chambers of the<br>
piston of torque transmitting device 112 is pressurized while shifting into the fourth,<br>
fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth speed ratios. It should be noted that, where only one<br>
chamber is pressurized during shifting, it may be desirable to pressurize both areas<br>
after the shift in order to reduce overall line pressure (pump pressure) for improved<br>
fuel economy.<br>
[0034]	Thus, for speed ratios where a large amount of clutch torque capacity is<br>
required to finish a shift, both piston chambers or areas will be pressurized. While<br>
shifting into speed ratios where smaller amounts of clutch torque capacity is required,<br>
only one of the chambers or areas will be pressurized. The result is that any pressure<br>
error induced torque disturbance is small compared to the torque required to complete<br>
the shift. In addition, using the smaller area to stroke the clutch reduces the oil volume<br>
needed to start the shift. The result is reduced shift delay.<br>
[0035]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
