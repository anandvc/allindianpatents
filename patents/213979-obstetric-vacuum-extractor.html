Obstetric vacuum extractor<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an obstetric suction device, a so called vacuum extractor,<br>
comprising a suction cup of a hard material, which suction cup is provided with connection<br>
for a tube and a connector piece, whereby the suction device further comprises a towing<br>
means of a flexible material as well as a locking means. The towing means comprises a<br>
handle, a connecting part and a connector.<br>
BACKGROUND AND THE PROBLEM<br>
Delivery may in certain cases not be finished in a natural way, but assistance in the form<br>
of different aid means is needed. Obstetric suction devices are used as aid means at<br>
deliveries. The indication of use may be fetal distress, fetus problems, which may e.g.,<br>
show in a weakened pulse of the fetus due to insufficient or closed oxygen addition<br>
through the placenta. Further indications of use may e.g., be a prolonged delivery period<br>
of the mother and condition of the mother requiring a shortened delivery period. Certain<br>
conditions are required for using obstetric suction devices. For example, the child must be<br>
fully-developed, 34 weeks old or older, further the amnion must be broken and the<br>
external os uteri be fully dilated.<br>
There are mainly two types of obstetric suction devices, those made of flexible materials,<br>
such as e.g., soft polymers, or rubber, alternatively, and those made of hard materials,<br>
such e.g., hard polymers or metal, e.g., stainless steel or brass, alternatively.<br>
In US 4,512,347 a hard obstetric suction device is described being made of metal,<br>
preferably stainless steel. The suction device comprises a suction cup, which is provided<br>
with connector piece in which connector piece a connecting part, e.g., a chain of fixedly<br>
secured. The suction device further comprises a handle which handle is releasably provided<br>
to the connecting part. This suction device is expensive to produce and is thought to be<br>
used multiple times.<br>
Further, US 4,620,544 describes a suction device comprising a suction cup, and a<br>
connection means. The suction cup is made of metal. On the sphere of the suction cup a<br>
rotating disc is provided, which rotating disc is provided with a transverse bar, which bar is<br>
attached to the disc at both its ends. On the transverse bar a ring is attached and in the<br>
ring the connecting part, a chain or similar means arranged. The chain serves as a<br>
connecting part and handle. Said rotating disc may create a cutting edge, which can hurt<br>
the other. Further, the suction cup is high and hard to clean. A soft obstetric suction device<br>
consisting of silicon of medical quality is described in WO 89/06112. The instrument is<br>
made in one piece and consists of a handle and a suction cup. The suction cup is available<br>
in two sizes having 50 and 60 mm innerdiameter respectively. The expected life length of a<br>
suction device according to WO 89/06112 is about two years, or 30 sterilisations in an<br>
autoclave at 134Â°C for three minutes, alternatively. Said suction cup is an external os uteri<br>
instrument which can not be used at all operations.<br>
US 5,224,947 describes an obstetric vacuum extractor comprising a suction cup and a<br>
connecting part. The suction cup is made of a soft material and the connecting piece in a<br>
semi-hard material. In the connecting piece, which inter alia is made of a tubular element,<br>
a tube is arranged to which tube a vacuum pump is connected. This contruction is not<br>
durable at practical use.<br>
US 6,074,399 describes an obstetric vacuum extractor comprising a suction cup, handle<br>
and a manually maneuovered vacuum pump, which parts are delivered as one unit. The<br>
suction cup is made of a flexible or harder material, alternatively. The suction cup or the<br>
whole device, alternatively, can be made as a disposable unit. The hand pump and the<br>
handle can be made for reuse. The invention above requires a specially contrued pump, in<br>
the form of a hand pump, which leads to complicating the manufacturing process. The<br>
manufacture is further expensive, in particular when the suction device is made as a<br>
disposable one, leading to an expensive product when bought. The hand pump leads to<br>
fact that the product can not be connected and used together with standard tubes.<br>
US 6,059,795 describes a suction device which is characterized in that a recess is arranged<br>
on the sphere of the suction cup. The tube connected to the vacuum pump is lowered into<br>
the recess which provides for a smooth sphere of the suction cup and which further<br>
provides for aplication of the suction device in complicated positions.<br>
The present invention discloses how one arranges a towing means to the suction cup. The<br>
invention provides an obstetric vacuum extractor totally made of polymeric materials<br>
having different properties adapted to what is being required for the suction cup and the<br>
towing means, respectively. The towing means comprising handle connecting part and<br>
connector can be made in one piece. The suction cup and the towing means are releasably<br>
arranged to each other but simultaneously can be fixed to each other by means of a<br>
locking means for maximum security at use. At the manufacture the suction cup is<br>
preferably injection-moulded as such and the towing means as such. Then the suction cup<br>
and the towing means are mounted together to one suction device and are packed and<br>
sterilized. At use the suction device is connected to a vacuum pump via a tube connection by means<br>
of a tube.<br>
THE OBJECTIVES AND THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM<br>
The object has been to solve the above described problem by obtaining a disposable obstetric vacuum<br>
extractor made of a hard material comprising a suction cup provided with a tube connection, and a<br>
connection means, further comprising a towing means and a locking means, The towing means<br>
comprises a handle, a connecting part and a connector, which parts can be made in one piece or can<br>
be made as separate units and are assembled, in use, as described hereinafter. The suction cup is<br>
made of a hard material and the towing means in a flexible, non-elastic material. The suction cup and<br>
the towing means, comprising handle, connecting part and connector are made of disposable polymer<br>
materials. The suction cup is made of hard polymer, such as a polycarbonate having formstable<br>
properties. The towing means is e.g., made of flexible plastic material which does not provide<br>
stretching but which is readily bent.<br>
This has been solved in that the connector piece has been made as an integrated part of the suction<br>
cup, preferably arranged on the sphere of the suction cup, said connecting part is arranged to be<br>
brought to fixation to said connector piece, said connector piece and connecting part being movably<br>
fixed to each other.<br>
Advantages of the invention are that<br>
- It is a disposable product which is thrown away after use, which is rational, hygienic and cost<br>
saving, as one need not to clean and sterilize the product costs will be kept down.<br>
- Handle, connecting part and connector can be made in one piece, the handle and the<br>
connector can be made tubular.<br>
- The connecting part can be made in different lengths and in such a way the suction device can<br>
be adapted to different needs and desire.<br>
- The connector can be varied, e.g., having the form of a ball which can rotate in all directions<br>
or having the form of a cylinder which moves radially in the connector piece but not<br>
sidewards.<br>
- The locking means can be varied and be adapted to different solutions, which improves<br>
security in connection with the use of the suction device.<br>
- It is cheap, simple and time efficient to produce the suction device, which in turn means that<br>
the price of the product can be kept low.<br>
- It is arranged in such a way that the suction cup release from the suction cupalp of the fetus<br>
when the traction force &gt; 20 kg, which is a safety mechanism not to damage the fetus and the<br>
mother.<br>
It can be connected to standard tubes and pumps via a tube connection , which<br>
means that no specially designed constructions are needed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following some preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in more<br>
detail with reference to the figures of said drawing.<br>
In accordance with all embodiments described below the obstetric vacuum extractor of the<br>
present invention comprises a suction cup, which in all figures of the drawing is denoted 1.<br>
Further the sd a towing means 6, comprising a handle 7, a connecting part 8 and a<br>
connector 9, which parts can be made in one piece. Further the same denotations are used<br>
in all figures for the same parts.<br>
The suction cup 1 has a substantially smooth outer surface, provided with substantially<br>
peripherally arranged reinforcing edge 2, which is preferably well rounded. The inner side<br>
of the suction cup 1 is substantially smooth, as well. Within the suction cup 1 a releasable<br>
bottom mplate 14 arranged, having the form of a net in any kind of polymer material. The<br>
bottom plate 14 distributes the suction force over the whole inner surface of the suction<br>
cup 1, to prevent a sticking against the scalp of the fetus. The suction cup 1 comes mainly<br>
in three different sizes having 40, 50, and 60 mm innerdiameter, respectively. The hard<br>
suction cup 1 will not become deformed, which means that one obtains a maximum<br>
adherence. On the suction cup 1, preferably on the sphere 3 of the suction cup there is a<br>
connector piece 4 substantially fixedly arranged for fastening the towing means 6. On the<br>
sphere 3 of the suction cup there is further a tube connector 5 arranged, which tube<br>
connector 5 connects the suction cup 1 with a vacuum pump by means of a substantially<br>
releasably arranged tube.<br>
According to a first embodiment, FIG. 1 a-e the handle is hollow and tubular. The<br>
connecting part 8 is in the form of a string. The connecting part 8 is further bendable<br>
sidewise but can not be stretched in a longitudinal direction. The connector 9 is a massive<br>
or hollow ball, alternatively.<br>
The connector piece 4 is fixedly arranged and integrated onto the sphere 3 of the suction<br>
cup and provided with slot 10. The connector piece 4, which in this embidment is present<br>
in the form of a casing is further provided with a substantially part spherical inner surface<br>
15. The connector 9 in this case in the form of ball is introduced into the connector piece 4<br>
whereby the connecting part 8 runs into the slot 10. The thickness of the connecting part 8<br>
is somewhat smaller than the width of the slot 10 to allow for an unimpeded run of the<br>
conecting part 8 in the slot 10. The tube connector 5 is fixedly arranged on the sphere 3 of<br>
the suction cup.<br>
The outer diameter of the ball is somewhat smaller than the inner diameter of the<br>
connector piece 4 leading to an allowance between the inner diameter of the connector<br>
piece 4 and the outer diameter of the ball. This leads to in turn that the ball can be readily<br>
introduced into the connector piece 4 and that it is movable in all directions. The walls<br>
inside the connector piece 4, the casing, is preferably made of part spherical surfaces 15,<br>
leading to the formation of a ball joint inside the connector piece 4 which in turn provides<br>
for advantages when it comes to tensile strength.<br>
The sd is further arranged in such a way that the suction cup 1 will release from the scalp<br>
of the fetus at traction forces &gt; 20 kg, which is a safety measure mechanism not to hurt<br>
the fetus or the mother.<br>
A locking means 11 is provided in the opening of the connector piece so that the connector<br>
9 should not slide out off the connector piece 4. According to a first embodiment the<br>
locking means 11 is a fixable, locking unit in the form of a plug which will become fastened<br>
in the opening of the connector piece when the connector 9 has been brought into the<br>
connector piece 4. The locking means 11, the plug, is then secured snapping it or glueing it<br>
threto. The locking means 11, the plug, has a part spherical end surface 16 to make it fit<br>
