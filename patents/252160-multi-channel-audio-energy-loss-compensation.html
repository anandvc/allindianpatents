				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to multi-channel reconstruction<br>
of audio signals based on an available stereo signal and<br>
additional control data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recent development in audio coding has made available the<br>
ability to recreate a multi-channel representation of an audio<br>
signal based on a stereo (or mono) signal and corresponding<br>
control data. These methods differ substantially from older<br>
matrix based solution such as Dolby Prologic, since additional<br>
control data is transmitted to control the re-creation, also<br>
referred to as up-mix, of the surround channels based on the<br>
transmitted mono or stereo channels.<br>
Hence, the parametric multi-channel audio decoders reconstruct<br>
N channels based on M transmitted channels, where N &gt; M, and<br>
the additional control data. The additional control data<br>
represents a significant lower data rate than transmitting the<br>
additional N-M channels, making the coding very efficient<br>
while at the same time ensuring compatibility with both M<br>
channel devices and N channel devices.<br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise a<br>
parameterisation of the surround signal based on IID (Inter<br>
channel Intensity Difference) and ICC (Inter Channel<br>
Coherence). These parameters describe power ratios and<br>
correlation between channel pairs in the up-mix process.<br>
Further parameters also used in prior art comprise prediction<br>
parameters used to predict intermediate or output channels<br>
during the up-mix procedure.<br>
One of the most appealing usage of prediction based method as<br>
described in prior art is for a system that re-creates 5.1<br>
channel from two transmitted channels. In this configuration a<br>
stereo transmission is available at the decoder side, which is<br>
a downmix of the original 5.1 multi-channel signal. In this<br>
context it is particularly interesting to be able to as<br>
accurately as possible extract the center channel from the<br>
stereo signal, since the center channel is usually downmixed<br>
to both the left and the right downmix channel. This is done<br>
by means of estimating two prediction coefficients describing<br>
the amount of each of the two transmitted channels used to<br>
build the center channel. These parameters are estimated for<br>
different frequency regions similarly to the IID and ICC<br>
parameters above.<br>
However, since the prediction parameters do not describe a<br>
power ratio of two signals, but are based on wave-form<br>
matching in a least square error sense, the method becomes<br>
inherently sensitive to any modification of the stereo<br>
waveform after the calculation of the prediction parameters.<br>
Further developments in audio coding over the recent years has<br>
introduced High Frequency Reconstruction methods as a very<br>
useful tool in audio codecs at low bitrates. One example is<br>
SBR (Spectral Band Replication) [WO 98/57436], that is used in<br>
MPEG standardized codecs such as MPEG-4 High Efficiency AAC.<br>
Common for these methods are that they re-create the high<br>
frequencies on the decoder side from a narrow-band signal<br>
coded by the underlying core-codec and a small amount of<br>
additional guidance information. Similar to the case of the<br>
parametric reconstruction of multi-channel signals based on<br>
one or two channels, the amount of control data required to<br>
re-create the missing signal components (in the case of SBR,<br>
the high frequencies), is significantly smaller than the<br>
amount of data that would be required to code the entire<br>
signal with a wave-form codec.<br>
It should be understood however, that the re-created highband<br>
signal, is perceptually equal to the original highband signal,<br>
while the actual wave-form differs significantly. Furthermore,<br>
for wave-form coders coding stereo signals at low bitrate<br>
stereo pre-processing is commonly used, which means that a<br>
limitation on the side signal of the mid/side representation<br>
of the stereo signal is performed.<br>
When a multi-channel representation is desired based on a<br>
stereo codec signal using MPEG-4 High Efficiency AAC or any<br>
other codec utilising high frequency reconstruction<br>
techniques, these and other aspects of the codec used to code<br>
the down-mixed stereo signal must be considered.<br>
Even further, it is common that for a recording available as a<br>
multi-channel audio signal there is a dedicated stereo mix<br>
available, that is not an automated down-mix version of the<br>
multi-channel signal. This is commonly referred to as<br>
"artistic down-mix". This down-mix cannot be expressed as a<br>
linear combination of the multi-channel signals.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved multi-channel down-mix/encoder or up-mix/decoder<br>
concept, which results in a better quality reconstructed<br>
multi-channel output.<br>
This object is achieved by a multi-channel synthesiser in<br>
accordance with claim 1, an encoder for processing a multi-<br>
channel input signal in accordance with claim 30, a method of<br>
generating at least three output channels in accordance with<br>
claim 42, a method of encoding in accordance with claim 43, an<br>
encoded multi-channel signal in accordance with claim 44, a<br>
data carrier in accordance with claim 45.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the problem of waveform<br>
modification of the down mixed multi-channel signal when<br>
prediction based up-mix methods are used. This includes when<br>
the down-mixed signal is coded by a codec performing stereo-<br>
pre-processing, high frequency reconstruction and other coding<br>
schemes that significantly modifies the waveform. Furthermore,<br>
the invention addresses the problem that arises when using<br>
predictive up-mix techniques for an artistic down-mix, i.e. a<br>
down-mix signal that is not automated from the multi-channel<br>
signal.<br>
The present invention comprises the following features:<br>
- Estimation of the prediction parameters based on the<br>
modified wave-form instead of the downmixed waveform;<br>
- Using of prediction based methods only in the frequency<br>
ranges where it is advantageous;<br>
- Correction of the energy loss and inaccurate correlation<br>
between channels introduced in the prediction based upmix<br>
procedure.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative for<br>
the principles of the present invention. It is understood that<br>
modifications and variations of the arrangements and the<br>
details described herein will be apparent to others skilled in<br>
the art. It is the intent, therefore, to be limited only by<br>
the scope of the impending patent claims and not by the<br>
specific details presented by way of description and<br>
explanation of the embodiments herein.<br>
It is emphasized that subsequent parameter calculation,<br>
application, upmixing, downmixing or any other actions can be<br>
performed on a frequency band selective base, i.e. for<br>
subbands in a filterbank.<br>
In order to outline the advantages of the present invention a<br>
more detailed description of a predictive upmix as known by<br>
prior art is given first. Let's assume a three channel upmix<br>
based on two downmix channels, as outlined in Fig 1, where 101<br>
represents the left original channel, 102 represents the<br>
center original channel,103 represents the right original<br>
channel, 104 represents the down-mix and parameter extraction<br>
module on the encoder side, 105 and 106 represents prediction<br>
parameters, 107 represents the left down-mixed channel, 108<br>
represents the right downmixed channel, 109 represents the<br>
predictive upmix module, and 110, 111 and 112 represents the<br>
reconstructed left, center, and right channel respectively.<br>
Assume the following definitions where X is a 3 x L matrix<br>
containing the three signal segments 1 (k) , r(k), c(k),<br>
k=0,...,L-1 as rows.<br>
Likewise, let the two downmixed signals lo(k) , r0(k) form the<br>
rows of X0. The downmix process is described by<br><br>
where the downmix matrix is defined by<br><br>
A preferred choice of downmix matrix is<br><br>
which means that the left downmix signal lo(k) will contain<br>
only 1 (k) and ac(k), and r0(k) will contain only r(k) and<br>
ac(k). This downmix matrix is preferred since it assigns an<br>
equal amount of the center channel to the left and right<br>
downmix, and since it does not assign any of the original<br>
right channel to the left downmix or vice versa.<br>
The upmix is defined by<br><br>
where C is a 3 x 2 upmix matrix.<br>
The predictive upmix as known from prior art relies on the<br>
idea of solving the overdetermined system<br><br>
for C in the least squares sense. This leads to the normal<br>
equations<br><br>
Multiplying (6) from the left with D gives DCX0X*0=X0X*0, which,<br>
in the generic case where X0X0* = DXX*D* is non-singular,<br>
implies<br><br>
where, In, denotes the n identity matrix. This relation reduces<br>
the parameter space C to dimension two.<br>
Given the above, the upmix matrix can be completely<br>
defined on the decoder side if the downmix matrix D is known,<br>
and two elements of the C matrix are transmitted, e.g. c11 and<br>
C22.<br>
The residual (prediction error) signals are given by<br><br>
Multiplying from the left with D yields<br><br>
due to (7). It follows that there is a 1 x L row vector signal<br>
xr such that<br><br>
where v is a 3 x 1 unit vector spanning the kernel (null<br>
space) of D. For instance, in the case of downmix (3), one can<br>
use <br>
In general, when and the this<br>
just means that, up to a weight factor, the residual signal is<br>
common for all three channels,<br><br>
Due to the orthogonality principle, the residual xr(k) is<br>
orthogonal to all three predicted signals l(k), ?(k), c(k).<br>
Problems solved and improvements obtained by preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention<br>
Evidently the following problems arise when using prediction<br>
based up-mix according to prior art as outlined above:<br>
• The method relies on matching wave-form in a least mean<br>
square errors sense, which does not work for systems<br>
where the waveform of the downmixed signals are not<br>
maintained.<br>
• The method does not provide the correct correlation<br>
structure between the reconstructed channels (as will be<br>
outlined below).<br>
• The method does not re-construct the right amount of<br>
energy in the reconstructed channels.<br>
Energy compensation<br>
As mentioned above, one of the problems with prediction based<br>
multi-channel re-construction is that the prediction error<br>
corresponds to an energy loss of the three reconstructed<br>
channels. In the below, the theory for this energy loss and a<br>
solution as taught by preferred embodiments is outlined.<br>
Firstly, the theoretical analysis is performed, and<br>
subsequently a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
according to the below outlined theory is given.<br>
Let E, Ê, and Er be the sum of the energies of the original<br>
signals in X, the predicted signals in X and the prediction<br>
error signals in Xr, respectively. From orthogonality, it<br>
follows that<br><br>
The total prediction gain can be defined as but in the<br>
following it will be more convenient to consider the parameter<br><br>
Hence, measures the total relative energy of the<br>
predictive upmix.<br>
Given this ?, it is possible to readjust each channel by<br>
applying a compensation gain, such that <br>
for z = 1, r, c. Specifically, the target energy is given by<br>
(12),<br><br>
so we need to solve<br><br>
Here, since v is a unit vector,<br><br>
and it follows from the definition (14) of ? and (13) that<br><br>
Putting all this together, we arrive at the gain<br><br>
It is evident that with this method, in addition to<br>
transmitting ?, the energy distribution of the decoded<br>
channels has to be computed at the decoder. Moreover only the<br>
energies are reconstructed correctly, while the off diagonal<br>
correlation structure is ignored.<br>
It is possible to derive a gain value that ensures that the<br>
total energy is preserved, while not ensuring that the energy<br>
of the individual channels are correct. A common gain for all<br>
channels gz = g that ensures that the total energy is preserved<br>
is obtained via the defining equation g2Ê = E. That is,<br><br>
By linearity, this gain can be applied in the encoder to the<br>
downmixed signals, so that no additional parameter has to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
Fig 2. outlines a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention that re-creates the three channels while maintaining<br>
the correct energy of the output channels. The downmixed<br>
signals l0 and r0 are input to the upmix module 201, along with<br>
the prediction parameters c1 and c2. The upmix module re-<br>
creates the upmix matrix C based on knowledge about the<br>
downmix matrix D and the received prediction parameters. The<br>
three output channels from 201 are input to 202 along with the<br>
adjustment parameter ?. The three channels are gain adjusted<br>
as a function of the transmitted parameter ? and the energy<br>
corrected channels are output.<br>
In Fig. 3 a more detailed embodiment of the adjustment module<br>
202 is displayed. The three up-mixed channels are input to<br>
adjustment module 304, as well as to module 301, 302 and 303<br>
respectively. The energy estimation modules 301 - 303<br>
estimates the energy of the three up-mixed signals and inputs<br>
the measured energy to adjustment module 304. The control<br>
signal ? (representing the prediction gain) received from the<br>
encoder is also input to 304. The adjustment module implements<br>
equation (19) as outlined above.<br>
In an alternative implementation of the present invention the<br>
energy correction can be done on the encoder side. Fig. 4<br>
illustrates an implementation of the encoder where the<br>
downmixed signals l0 107 and r0 108 are gain adjusted by 401<br>
and 402 according to a gain value calculated by 403. The gain<br>
value is derived according to equation (20) above. As outlined<br>
above it is an advantage of this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, since it is not necessary to calculate the energy<br>
of the three re-created channels from the predictive up-mix.<br>
However, this only ensures that the total energy of the three<br>
re-created channels is correct. It does not ensure that the<br>
energy of the individual channels are correct.<br>
A preferred example for a down-mixing matrix corresponding to<br>
equation (3) is noted below the down-mixer in Fig. 4. However,<br>
the down-mixer can apply any general down-mix matrix as<br>
outlined in equation (2).<br>
As will be outlined later on, for the present case of a down-<br>
mixer having, as an input, three channels, and, having, as an<br>
output, two channels, two additional up-mix parameters C1, C2<br>
are at least required. When a down-mixing matrix D is variable<br>
or not fully known to a decoder, also additional information on<br>
the used down-mix has to be transmitted from the encoder-side<br>
to a decoder-side, in addition to the parameters 105 and 106.<br>
Correlation structure<br>
One of the problems with the up-mix procedure described by<br>
prior art is that it does not re-construct the correct<br>
correlation between the re-created channels. Since, as was<br>
outlined above, the centre channel is predicted as a linear<br>
combination of the left down-mix channel and the right down-<br>
mix channel, and the left and right channels are re-<br>
constructed by subtracting the predicted center channel from<br>
the left and right down-mix channels. It is evident that the<br>
prediction error will result in remains of the original center<br>
channel in the predicted left and right channel. This implies<br>
that the correlations between the three channels are not the<br>
same for the reconstructed channels as it was for the original<br>
three channels.<br>
A preferred embodiment teaches that the predicted three<br>
channels should be combined with de-correlated signals in<br>
accordance with the measured prediction error.<br>
The basic theory for achieving the correct correlation<br>
structure is now outlined. The special structure of the<br>
residual can be used to reconstruct the full 3 x 3 correlation<br>
structure XX* by substituting a de-correlated signal xd for<br>
the residual in the decoder.<br>
First, note that the normal equations (6) lead to XrX*0=0 so<br><br>
Hence, as <br><br>
where (10) and (17) were applied for the last equality.<br>
Let xd be a signal de-correlated from all decoded signals l,<br>
?, c such that The enhanced signal<br><br>
then has the correlation matrix<br><br>
In order to completely reproduce the original correlation<br>
matrix (22), it suffices that<br><br>
If xd is obtained by de-correlating the downmixed signal, say<br>
 followed by a gain ? then it should hold that<br>
This gain can be computed in the encoder. However, if the more<br>
well-defined parameter from (14) is to be used,<br>
estimation of Ê and has to be performed in the<br>
decoder. In light of this, a more attractive alternative is to<br>
generate xd using three decorrelators<br><br>
since then so (25) is satisfied by the choice<br><br>
Fig. 5 illustrates one embodiment of the present invention for<br>
predictive up-mix of three channels from two down-mix<br>
channels, while maintaining the correct correlation structure<br>
between the channels. In Fig. 5 module 109, 110, 111 and 112<br>
are the same as in Fig. 1 and will not be elaborated further<br>
on here. The three up-mixed signals that are output from 109<br>
are input to de-correlation modules 501, 502 and 503. These<br>
generate mutually de-correlated signals. The de-correlated<br>
signals are summed and input to the mixing modules 504, 505<br>
and 506, where they are mixed with the output from 109.<br>
The mixing of the predictive up-mixed signals with de-<br>
correlated versions of the same is an essential feature of the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 6 one embodiment of the mixing<br>
modules 504, 505 and 506 is displayed. In this embodiment of<br>
the invention the level of the de-correlated signal is<br>
adjusted by 601 based on the control signal ?. The de-<br>
correlated signal is subsequently added to the predictive up-<br>
mixed signal in 602.<br>
A third preferred embodiment uses decorrelators 501, 502, 503<br>
for the up-mixed channels. A de-correlated signal can also be<br>
generated by a de-correlator 501', which receives, as an input<br>
signal, the down-mix channel or even all down-mix channels.<br>
Furthermore, in case of more than one down-mix channel, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the de-correlation signal can also be<br>
generated by separate de-correlators for the left base channel<br>
l0 and the right base channel r0 and by combining the output of<br>
these separate de-correlators. This possibility is<br>
substantially the same as the possibility shown in Fig. 5, but<br>
has a difference to the possibility shown in Fig. 5 in that the<br>
base channels before up-mixing are used.<br>
Furthermore, it is outlined in connection with Fig. 5 that the<br>
mixing modules 504, 505 and 506 do not only receive the factor<br>
Y, which is equal for all three channels, since this factor<br>
only depends on the energy measure p, but also receive the<br>
channel-specific factor vl, vc and vr, which is determined as<br>
outlined in connection with equations (10) and (11). This<br>
parameter, however, does not have to be transmitted from an<br>
encoder to a decoder, when the decoder knows the down-mix used<br>
at the encoder. Instead, these parameters in the matrix v as<br>
shown in equation (10) and (11) are preferably pre-programmed<br>
into the mixing modules 504, 505, and 506 so that these<br>
channel-specific weighting factors do not have to be<br>
transmitted (but can of course be transmitted when required).<br>
In Fig. 6, it is shown that the weighting device 601 adjusts<br>
the energy of the de-correlated signal using the product of ?<br>
and the channel-specific down-mix-dependent parameter vz,<br>
wherein z stands for 1, r or c. In this context, it is noted<br>
that equation (26a) makes sure that the energy of xd is equal<br>
to the sum energy of the predictively up-mixed left, right and<br>
centre channels. Therefore, device 601 can simply be<br>
implemented as a scaler using the scaling factor GI. When,<br>
however, the de-correlated signal is generated alternatively,<br>
the mixing module 504, 505, 506 has to perform an absolute<br>
energy adjustment of the de-correlated signal added by adding<br>
device 602 so that the energy of the signal added at adder 602<br>
is equal to the energy of the residual signal, e.g., the<br>
energy, which is lost by the non-energy preserving predictive<br>
up-mix.<br>
Regarding the channel-specific down-mix-dependent parameter vz,<br>
the same remarks as outlined above with respect to Fig. 6 also<br>
apply for the Fig. 7 embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be noted here that the Fig. 6 and Fig. 7<br>
embodiment are based on the recognition that at least a part of<br>
the energy lost in the predictive up-mixing is added using a<br>
de-correlation signal. In order to have correct signal energies<br>
and correct portions of the dry signal component (un-<br>
corrected) signal and the "wet" signal component (de-<br>
correlated) , it is to be made sure that the "dry" signal input<br>
into the mixing module 504 is not pre-scaled. When, for<br>
example, the base channels have been pre-corrected on the de-<br>
encoder-side (as shown in Fig. 4) then this pre-correction of<br>
Fig. 4 has to be compensated for by multiplying the channel by<br>
the (relative) energy measure p before inputting the channel<br>
into the mixer box 504, 505 or 506. Additionally, the same<br>
procedure has to be done, when such an energy correction has<br>
been performed on a decoder-side before entering the down-mix<br>
channels into the up-mixer 109 as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
When only a part of the residual energy is to be covered by a<br>
de-correlated signal, pre-correction only has to be partly<br>
removed by pre-scaling the signal input into the mixing box<br>
504, 505, 506 by a p-dependent factor, which is, however,<br>
closer to one than the factor p itself. Naturally, this partly-<br>
compensating pre-scaling factor will depend on the encoder-<br>
generated signal ? input at 605 in Fig. 7. When such a partly<br>
pre-scaling has to be performed, then the weighting factor<br>
applied in G2 is not necessary. Instead, then the branch from<br>
input 604 to the summer 602 will be the same as in Fig. 6.<br>
Controlling the degree of decorrelation<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention teaches that the<br>
amount of de-correlation added to the predicted up-mixed<br>
signals can be controlled from the encoder, while still<br>
maintaining the correct output energy. This is since in a<br>
typical "interview" example of dry speech in the center<br>
channel and ambience in the left and right channels, the<br>
substitution of de-correlated signal for prediction error in<br>
the center channel may be undesirable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
an alternative mixing procedure to the one outlined in Fig. 5<br>
can be used. It will be shown below how according to the<br>
present invention the issues of total energy preservation and<br>
true correlation reproduction can be separated and the amount<br>
of de-correlation can be controlled by the parameter k.<br>
We will assume that a total energy preserving gain<br>
compensation (20) has been performed on the downmixed signal,<br>
so that we first obtain the decoded signal . From this, a<br>
decorrelated signal d with same total energy is<br>
produced, for instance by use of three decorrelators as in the<br>
previous section. The total upmix is then defined according to<br><br>
where is a transmitted parameter. The choice ?=1<br>
corresponds to total energy preservation without decorrelated<br>
signal addition and K=p corresponds to full 3 x 3 correlation<br>
structure reproduction. We have<br><br>
so the total energy is preserved for all as it can be<br>
seen by computing the traces (sum of diagonal values) of the<br>
matrices in (30). However, correct individual energy is only<br>
obtained for ? = ?.<br>
Fig 7 illustrates an embodiment of the mixing modules 504, 505<br>
and 506 of Fig. 5 according to the theory outlined above. In<br>
this alternative of the mixing modules the control parameter y<br>
is input to 702 and 701. The gain factor used for 702<br>
corresponds to ? according to equation (29) above, and the<br>
gain factor used for 701 corresponds to according to<br>
equation (29) above.<br>
The above described embodiment of the present invention,<br>
allows the system to employ a detection mechanism on the<br>
encoder side, that estimates the amount of de-correlation to<br>
be added in the prediction based up-mix. The implementation<br>
described in Fig. 7 will add the indicated amount of de-<br>
correlated signal, and apply energy correction so that the<br>
total energy of the three channels is correct, while still<br>
being able to replace an arbitrary amount of the prediction<br>
error by de-correlated signal.<br>
This means that for an example with three ambient signals,<br>
e.g. a classical music piece, with a lot of ambience, the<br>
encoder can detect the lack of a "dry" center channel, and let<br>
the decoder replace the entire prediction error with de-<br>
correlated signal, thus re-creating the ambience of the sound<br>
from the three channels in a way that would not be possible<br>
with prior-art prediction based methods alone. Furthermore,<br>
for a signal with a dry center channel, e.g. speech in the<br>
center channel and ambient sounds in the left and right<br>
channels, the encoder detects that replacing the prediction<br>
error by de-correlated signal is not psycho-acoustically<br>
correct and instead let the decoder adjust the levels of the<br>
three reconstructed channels so that the energy of the three<br>
channels is correct. Obviously the extreme examples above<br>
represents two possible outcomes of the invention. It is not<br>
limited to cover just the extreme cases outlined in the above<br>
examples.<br>
Adapting the prediction coefficients to modified waveforms.<br>
As outlined above the prediction parameters are estimated by<br>
minimising the mean square error given the original three<br>
channels X and a downmix matrix D. However, in many situations<br>
it cannot be relied upon that the downmixed signal can be<br>
described as a downmix matrix D multiplied by a matrix X<br>
describing the original multichannel signal.<br>
One obvious example for this is when a so called "artistic<br>
downmix" is used, i.e. the two channel downmix can not be<br>
described as a linear combination of the multichannel signal.<br>
Another example is when the downmixed signal is coded by a<br>
perceptual audio codec that utilises stereo-pre processing or<br>
other tools for improved coding efficiency. It is commonly<br>
known in prior art that many perceptual audio codecs rely on<br>
mid/side stereo coding, where the side signal is attenuated<br>
under bitrate constrained condition, yielding an output that<br>
has a narrower stereo image than that of the signal used for<br>
encoding.<br>
Fig 8 displays a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
where the parameter extraction on the encoder side apart from<br>
the multi-channel signal also has access to the modified<br>
downmix signal. The modified down-mix is here generated by<br>
801. If only two parameters of the C matrix are transmitted, a<br>
knowledge of the D matrix on the decoder side is needed in<br>
order to be able to do the up-mix, and get the least mean<br>
square error for all up-mixed channels. However, the present<br>
embodiment teaches that you can replace the downmixed signals<br>
10 and r0 on the encoder side by the downmixed signals 1'0 and<br>
r'0 that are obtained by using a downmix matrix D that is not<br>
necessarily the same as that assumed on the decoder. Using the<br>
alternative downmix for parameter estimation on the encoder<br>
side only guarantees a correct center channel reproduction at<br>
the decoder side. By transmitting additional information from<br>
the encoder to the decoder a more accurate up-mix of the three<br>
channels can be obtained. In one extreme case all six elements<br>
of the C matrix can be transmitted. However, the present<br>
embodiment teaches that a subset of the C matrix can be<br>
transmitted if it is accompanied with information on the<br>
downmix matrix D used 802.<br>
As mentioned earlier perceptual audio codecs employ mid/side<br>
coding for stereo coding at low bitrates. Furthermore, stereo<br>
pre-processing is commonly employed in order to reduce the<br>
energy of the side signal under bitrate constrained<br>
conditions. This is done based on the psycho acoustical notion<br>
that for a stereo signal reduction of the width of the stereo<br>
signal is a preferred coding artefact over audible<br>
quantisation distortion and bandwidth limitation.<br>
Hence, if a stereo pre-processing is used, the down-mix<br>
equation (3), can be expressed as<br><br>
where ? is the attenuation of the side signal. As outlined<br>
earlier the D matrix needs to be known on the decoder side in<br>
order to correctly be able to reconstruct the three channels.<br>
Hence, the present embodiment teaches that the attenuation<br>
factor should be sent to the decoder.<br>
Fig. 9 displays another embodiment of the present invention<br>
where the downmix signal l0 and r0 output from 104 is input to<br>
a stereo pre-processing device 901 that limits the side signal<br>
(lo - r0) of the mid/side representation of the downmix signal<br>
by a factor ?. This parameter is transmitted to the decoder.<br>
Parameterisation for HFR codec signals<br>
If the prediction based upmix is used with High Frequency<br>
Reconstruction methods such as SBR [WO 98/57436], the<br>
prediction parameters estimated on the encoder side will not<br>
match the re-created high band signal on the decoder side. The<br>
present embodiment teaches the use of an alternative non-wave<br>
form based up-mix structure for re-creation of three channels<br>
from two. The proposed up-mix procedure is designed to re-<br>
create the correct energy of all up-mixed channels in case of<br>
un-correlated noise signals.<br>
Assuming that the downmix matrix Da as defined in (3) is used.<br>
And that we now will define the upmix matrix C . Then the upmix<br>
is defined by<br><br>
Striving at only re-creating the correct energy of the up-<br>
mixed signal l (k), r(k), and c(k), where the energies are L, R<br>
and C, the up-mix matrix is chosen so that the diagonal<br>
elements of XX* and XX* are the same, according to:<br><br>
The corresponding expression for the downmix matrix will be<br><br><br>
Setting the diagonal element of equal to the diagonal<br>
element of translates to three equations defining the<br>
relation between the elements in C and L, R and C<br><br>
Based on the above an up-mix matrix can be defined. It is<br>
preferable to define an up-mix matrix that does not add the<br>
right down-mixed channel to the left up-mixed channel and vice<br>
versa. Hence, a suitable up-mix matrix may be<br>
This gives a C matrix according to:<br><br>
It can be shown that the elements of the C matrix can be re-<br>
created on the decoder side from the two transmitted<br>
parameters <br>
Fig 10 outlines a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Here 101 - 112 are the same as in Fig. 1 and will<br>
not be elaborated on further here. The three original signals<br>
101 - 103 are input to the estimation module 1001. This module<br>
estimates two parameters, e.g. from which the<br>
C matrix can be derived on the decoder side. These parameters<br>
along with the parameters output from 104 are input to<br>
selection module 1002. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
selection module 1002 outputs the parameters from 104 if the<br>
parameters correspond to a frequency range that is coded by a<br>
wave-form codec, and outputs the parameters from 1001 if the<br>
parameters correspond to a frequency range reconstructed by<br>
HFR. The selection module 1002 also outputs information 1005<br>
on which parameterisation is used for the different frequency<br>
ranges of the signal.<br>
On the decoder side the module 1004 takes the transmitted<br>
parameters and directs them to the predictive up-mix 109 or<br>
the energy-based up-mix 1003 according to the above, dependent<br>
on the indication given by the parameter 1005. The energy<br>
based up-mix 1003 implements the up-mix matrix C according to<br>
equation (40).<br>
The upmix matrix C as outlined in equation (40) has equal<br>
weights (8) to obtain the estimated (decoder) signal c(k) from<br>
the two downmixed signals lo(k), ro(k). Based on the<br>
observation that the relative amount of the signal c(k) may<br>
differ in the two downmixed signals l0(k), ro(k) (i.e., C/L not<br>
equal to C/R), one could also consider the following generic<br>
upmix matrix:<br><br>
In order to estimate c(k), this embodiment also requires<br>
transmission of two control parameters c1 and c2, which are<br>
for example equal to . A<br>
possible implementation of the upmix matrix functions fi is<br>
then given by<br><br>
The signalling of the different parameterisation for the SBR<br>
range according to the present invention is not limited to<br>
SBR. The above outlined parameterisation can be used in any<br>
frequency range where the prediction error of the prediction<br>
based up-mix is deemed too large. Hence, module 1002 may<br>
output the parameters from 1001 or 104 dependent on a<br>
multitude of criteria, such as coding method of the<br>
transmitted signals, prediction error etc.<br>
A preferred method for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction includes, at the encoder side, extracting<br>
different multi-channel parameterisations for different<br>
frequency ranges, and, at the decoder side, applying these<br>
parameterisations to the frequency ranges in order to re-<br>
construct the multi-channels.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes a method for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction including, at the encoder side, extracting<br>
information on the down-mix process used and subsequently<br>
sending this information to a decoder, and, at the decoder<br>

parameters and the information on the down-mix in order to<br>
reconstruct the multi-channels.<br>

the down-mix signal is adjusted in accordance with a prediction<br>
error obtained for the extracted predictive up-mix parameters.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates<br>

reconstruction, in which, at the decoder side, an energy lost<br>
due to the prediction error is compensated for by applying a<br>
gain to the up-mixed channels.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a<br>
method for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction, in which, at the decoder side, the energy lost<br>
due to a prediction error is replaced by a de-correlated<br>
signal.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates<br>
to a method for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction, in which, at the decoder side, a part of the<br>
energy lost due to a prediction error is replaced by a de-<br>
correlated signal, and a part of the energy lost is replaced by<br>
applying a gain to the up-mixed channels. This part of the<br>
energy lost is preferably signalled from an encoder.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention is an<br>
apparatus for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction comprising means for adjusting the energy of the<br>
down-mix signal in accordance with the prediction error<br>
obtained for the extracted predictive up-mix parameters.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention is an<br>
apparatus for improved prediction based multi-channel<br>
reconstruction comprising means for compensating for the energy<br>
loss due to the prediction error by applying a gain to the up-<br>
mixed channels.<br>

Fig. 11 shows a multi-channel synthesiser for generating at<br>
least three output channels 1100 using an input signal having<br>
at least one base channel 1102, the at least one base channel<br>
being derived from an original multi-channel signal. The multi-<br>
channel synthesiser as shown in Fig. 11 includes an up-mixer<br>
device 1104, which can be implemented as shown in any of the<br>
Figures 2 to 10. Generally, the up-mixer device 1104 is<br>
operable to up-mix the at least one base channel using an up-<br>
mixing rule so that the at least three output channels are<br>
obtained. The up-mixer 1104 is operative to generate the at<br>
least three output channels in response to an energy measure<br>
1106 and at least two different up-mixing parameters 1108 using<br>
an energy-loss introducing up-mixing rule so that the at least<br>
three output channels have an energy, which is higher than an<br>
energy of signals resulting from the energy-loss introducing<br>
up-mixing rule alone. Thus,irrespective of an energy error<br>
depending on the energy-loss introducing up-mixing rule, the<br>
invention results in an energy compensated result, wherein the<br>
energy compensation can be done by scaling and/or addition of a<br>
decorrelated signal. The at least two different up-mixing<br>
parameters 1108, and the energy measure 1106 are included in<br>
the input signal.<br>
Preferably, the energy measure is any measure related to an<br>
energy loss introduced by the upmixing rule. It can be an<br>
absolute measure of the upmix-introduced energy error or the<br>
energy of the upmix signal (which is normally lower in energy<br>
than the original signal), or it can be a relative measure such<br>
as a relation between the original signal energy and the upmix<br>
signal energy or a relation between the energy error and the<br>
original signal energy or even a relation between the energy<br>
error and the upmix signal energy. A relative energy measure<br>
can be used as a correction factor, but nevertheless is an<br>
energy measure since it depends on the energy error introduced<br>
into the upmix signal generated by an energy-loss introducing<br>
upmixing rule or - stated in other words - a non-energy-<br>
preserving upmixing rule.<br>
An exemplary energy-loss introducing upmixing rule (non-energy-<br>
preserving upmixing rule) is an upmix using transmitted<br>
prediction coefficients. In case of a non-prefect prediction of<br>
a frame or subband of a frame, the upmix output signal is<br>
affected by a prediction error, corresponding to an energy<br>
loss. Naturally, the prediction error varies from frame to<br>
frame, since in case of an almost perfect prediction (a low<br>
prediction error) only a small compensation (by scaling or<br>
adding a decorrelated signal) has to be done while in case of a<br>
larger prediction error (a non-perfect prediction) more<br>
compensation has to be done. Therefore, the energy measure also<br>
varies between a value indicating no or only a small<br>
compensation and a value indicating a large compensation.<br>
When the energy measure is considered as an InterChannel<br>
Coherence (ICC) value, which consideration is natural, when the<br>
compensation is done by adding a decorrelated signal scaled<br>
depending on the energy measure, the preferably used relative<br>
energy measure (p) varies typically between 0.8 and 1.0,<br>
wherein 1.0 indicates that the upmixed signals are decorrelated<br>
as reguired or that no decorrelated signal has to be added or<br>
that the energy of the predictive upmix result is equal to the<br>
energy of the original signal or that the prediction error is<br>
zero.<br>
However, the present invention is also useful in connection<br>
with other energy-loss introducing upmixing rules, i.e. rules<br>
that are not based on waveform matching but that are based on<br>
other techniques, such as the use of codebooks, spectrum<br>
matching, or any other upmixing rules that do not care for<br>
energy preservation.<br>
Generally, the energy compensation can be performed before or<br>
after applying the energy-loss introducing upmixing rule.<br>
Alternatively, the energy loss compensation can even be<br>
included into the upmixing rule such as by altering the<br>
original matrix coefficients using the energy measure so that a<br>
new upmixing rule is generated and used by the upmixer. This<br>
new upmixing rule is based on the energy-loss introducing<br>
upmixing rule and the energy measure. Stated in other words,<br>
this embodiment is related to a situation in which the energy<br>
compensation is "mixed" into the "enhanced" upmixing rule so<br>
that the energy compensation and/or the addition of a<br>
decorrelated signal are performed by applying one or more<br>
upmixing matrices to an input vector (the one or more base<br>
channel) to obtain (after the one or more matrix operations)<br>
the output vector (the reconstructed multi-channel signal<br>
having at least three channels).<br>
Preferably, the up-mixer device receives two base channels l0,<br>
r0 and outputs three re-constructed channels l, r and c.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to Fig. 12 to show an example<br>
energy situation at different positions on an encoder-decoder-<br>
path. Block 1200 shows an energy of a multi-channel audio<br>
signal such as a signal having at least a left channel, a right<br>
channel and a centre channel as shown in Fig. 1. For the<br>
embodiment in Fig. 12, it is assumed that the input channels<br>
101, 102, 103 in Fig. 1 are completely uncorrelated, and that<br>
the down-mixer is energy-preserving. In this case, the energy<br>
of the one or more base channels indicated by block 1202 is<br>
identical to the energy 1200 of the multi-channel original<br>
signal. When the original multi-channel signals are correlated<br>
to each other, the base channel energy 1202 can be lower than<br>
the energy of the original multi-channel signal, when, for<br>
example, the left and the right (partly) cancel each other.<br>
For the subsequent discussion, however, it is assumed that the<br>
energy 1202 of the base channels is the same as the energy 1200<br>
of the original multi-channel signal.<br>
1204 illustrates the energy of the up-mix signals, when the up-<br>
mix signals (e.g., 110, 111, 112 of Fig. 1) are generated using<br>
a non-energy preserving up-mix or a predictive up-mix as<br>
discussed in connection with Fig. 1. Since, as will be outlined<br>
later with respect to Fig. 14a, and 14b, such a predictive up-<br>
mix introduces an energy error Er, the energy 1204 of the up-<br>
mix result will be lower than the energy of the base channels<br>
1202.<br>
The up-mixer 1104 is operative to output output channels, which<br>
have an energy, which is higher than the energy 1204.<br>
Preferably, the up-mixer device 1104 performs a complete<br>
compensation so that the up-mix result 1100 in Fig. 11 has an<br>
energy as shown at 1206.<br>
Preferably, the up-mix result, the energy of which is shown at<br>
1204, is not simply up-scaled as shown in Fig. 2, or<br>
individually up-scaled as shown in Fig. 3 or encoder-side up-<br>
scaled as shown in Fig. 4. Instead, the remaining energy Er,<br>
which corresponds to the error due to the predictive up-mix is<br>
"filled up" using a de-correlated signal. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, this energy error Er is only partly covered by a<br>
de-correlated signal, while the rest of the energy error is<br>
made up by up-scaling the up-mix result. The complete covering<br>
of the energy error by a de-correlated signal is shown in Fig.<br>
5 and Fig. 6, while the "in-part"-solution is illustrated by<br>
Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a plurality of energy-compensation methods, e.g.,<br>
methods, which have in common the feature that, based on an<br>
energy measure which depends on the energy error, the energy of<br>
the output channels is higher than the pure result of the<br>
predictive up-mix, i.e., the result of the (not-corrected)<br>
energy-loss introducing upmixing rule.<br>
Number 1 of the Table in Fig. 13 relates to the decoder-side<br>
energy compensation, which is performed subsequent to the up-<br>
mix. This option is shown in Fig. 2 and is, additionally,<br>
further elaborated in connection with Fig. 3, which shows the<br>
channel-specific up-scaling factors gz, which not only depend<br>
on the energy measure ?, but which, additionally, depend on the<br>
channel-dependent down-mix factors vz, wherein z stands for 1,<br>
r or c.<br>
Number 2 of Fig. 13 includes the encoder-side energy<br>
compensation method, which is performed subsequent to the down-<br>
mix, which is illustrated in Fig. 4. This embodiment is<br>
preferable in that the energy measure ? or ? does not have to be<br>
transmitted from the encoder to the decoder.<br>
Number 3 of the Table in Fig. 13 relates to the decoder-side<br>
energy compensation, which is performed before the up-mix. When<br>
Fig. 2 is considered, the energy correction 202, which is<br>
performed after the up-mix in Fig. 2 would be performed before<br>
the up-mix block 201 in Fig. 2. This embodiment results,<br>
compared to Fig. 2, in an easier implementation, since no<br>
channel-specific correction factors as shown in Fig. 3 are<br>
required, although quality losses might occur.<br>
Number 4 of Fig. 13 relates to a further embodiment, in which<br>
an encoder-side correction is performed before down-mixing.<br>
When Fig. 1 is considered, channels 101, 102, 103 would be up-<br>
scaled by a corresponding compensation factor so that the down-<br>
mixer output is increased after down-mixing as shown at 1208 in<br>
Fig. 12. Thus, the number four embodiment in Fig. 13 has the<br>
same consequence for the base channels' output by an encoder as<br>
the number two embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Number 5 of the Fig. 13 Table relates to the embodiment in Fig.<br>
5, when the de-correlated signal is derived from the channels<br>
generated by the non-energy preserving up-mixing rule 109 in<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
The number 6 embodiment in the Table in Fig. 13 relates to the<br>
embodiment, in which only part of the residual energy is<br>
covered by the de-correlated signal. This embodiment is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
The number 8 embodiment of Fig. 13 is similar to the number 5<br>
or 6 embodiment, but the de-correlated signal is derived from<br>
the base channels before up-mixing as outlined by box 501' in<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred embodiment of the encoder is<br>
described in detail. Fig. 14a illustrates an encoder for<br>
processing a multi-channel input signal 1400 having at least<br>
two channels and, preferably, having at least three channels 1,<br>
c, r.<br>
The encoder includes an energy measure calculator 1402 for<br>
calculating an error measure depending on an energy difference<br>
between an energy of the multi-channel input signal 1400 or an<br>
at least one base channel 1404 and an up-mixed signal 1406<br>
generated by a non-energy conserving up-mixing operation 1407.<br>
Furthermore, the encoder includes an output interface 1408 for<br>
outputting the at least one base channel after being scaled<br>
(401, 402) by a scaling factor 403 depending on the energy<br>
measure or for outputting the energy measure itself.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the encoder includes a down-mixer<br>
1410 for generating the at least one base channel 1404 from the<br>
original multi-channels 1400. For generating the up-mix<br>
parameters, a difference calculator 1414 and a parameter<br>
optimiser 1416 are also present. These elements are operative<br>
to find the best-matching up-mix parameters 1412. At least two<br>
of this set of best fitting up-mix parameters are outputted via<br>
the output interface as the parameter output in a preferred<br>
embodiment. The difference calculator is preferably operative<br>
to perform a minimum means square error calculation between the<br>
original multi-channel signal 1400 and the up-mixer-generated<br>
up-mix signal for parameters input at parameter line 1412. This<br>
parameter optimisation procedure can be performed by several<br>
different optimisation procedures, which are all driven by the<br>
goal to obtain a best-matching up-mix result 1406 by a certain<br>
up-mixing matrix included in the up-mixer 1408.<br>
The functionality of Fig. 14a encoder is shown in Fig. 14b.<br>
After a down-mixing step 1440 performed by the down-mixer 1410,<br>
the base channel or the plurality of base channels can be<br>
output as illustrated by 1442. Then, an up-mix parameter<br>
optimisation step 1444 is performed, which, depending on a<br>
certain optimisation strategy, can be an iterative or non-<br>
iterative procedure. However, iterative procedures are<br>
preferred. Generally, the up-mix parameter optimisation<br>
procedure can be implemented such that the difference between<br>
the up-mix result and the original signal is as low as<br>
possible. Depending on the implementation, this difference can<br>
be an individual channel-related difference or a combined<br>
difference. Generally, the up-mix parameter optimisation step<br>
1444 is operative in minimising any cost function, which can be<br>
derived from individual channels or from combined channels so<br>
that, for one channel, a larger difference (error) is accepted,<br>
when a much better matching is, for example, achieved for the<br>
other two channels.<br>
Then, when the best fitting parameters set, e.g., the best<br>
fitting up-mix matrix has been found, at least two up-mixing<br>
parameters of the parameters set generated by step 1444 are<br>
output to the output interface as indicated by step 1446.<br>
Furthermore, after the up-mix parameter optimisation step 1444<br>
is complete, the energy measure can be calculated and output as<br>
indicated by step 1448. Generally, the energy measure will<br>
depend on the energy error 1210. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
energy measure is the factor ? which depends on the relation of<br>
the energy of the up-mix result 1406 and the energy of the<br>
original signal 1400 as shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, the<br>
energy measure calculated and output can be an absolute value<br>
for the energy error 1210 or can be the absolute energy of the<br>
up-mix result 1406, which, of course, depends on the energy<br>
error. In this context, it is to be noted that the energy<br>
measure as output by the output interface 1408 is preferably<br>
quantized, and, again preferably entropy-encoded using any<br>
well-known entropy-encoder such as an arithmetic encoder, a<br>
Huffman encoder or a run-length encoder, which is especially<br>
useful when there are many subsequent identical energy<br>
measures. Alternatively or additionally, the energy measures<br>
for subsequent time portions or frames can be difference-<br>
encoded, wherein this difference-encoding is preferably<br>
performed before entropy-coding.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to Fig. 15a showing an<br>
alternative down-mixer embodiment, which is, in accordance with<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention, combined to<br>
the Fig. 14a encoder. The Fig. 15a embodiment covers an SBR-<br>
implementation, although this embodiment can also be used in<br>
cases, in which no spectral band replication is performed, but<br>
in which the complete bandwidth of the base channels is<br>
transmitted. The Fig. 15a encoder includes a down-mixer 1500<br>
for down-mixing the original signal 1500 to obtain at least one<br>
base channel 1504. In a non-SBR-embodiment, the at least one<br>
base channel 1504 is input into a core coder 1506, which can be<br>
an AAC encoder for mono-signals in case of a single base<br>
channel, or which can be any stereo coder in case of for<br>
example two stereo base channels. On the output of the core<br>
coder 1506, a bit stream including an encoded base channel or<br>
including a plurality of encoded base channels is output<br>
(1508).<br>
When the Fig. 15a embodiment has an SBR functionality, the at<br>
least one base channel 1504 is low-pass filtered 1510 before<br>
being input into the core coder. Naturally, the functionalities<br>
of blocks 1510 and 1506 can be implemented by a single encoder<br>
device, which performs low-pass filtering and core coding<br>
within a single encoding algorithm.<br>
The encoded base channels at the output 1508 only include a<br>
low-band of the base channels 1504 in encoded form. Information<br>
on the high-band is calculated by an SBR spectral envelope<br>
calculator 1512, which is connected to an SBR information<br>
encoder 1514 for generating and outputting encoded SBR-side<br>
information at an output 1516.<br>
The original signal 1502 is input into an energy calculator<br>
1520, which generates channel energies (for a certain time<br>
period of the original channels l, c, r, wherein the channel<br>
energies are indicated by L, C, R, output by block 1520). The<br>
channel energies L, C, R, are input into a parameter calculator<br>
block 1522. The parameter calculator 1522 outputs two up-mix<br>
parameters c1, c2, which can, for example, be the parameters<br>
c1, c2, indicated in Fig. 15a. Naturally, other (e.g. linear)<br>
energy combinations involving the energies of all input<br>
channels can be generated by the parameter calculator 1522 for<br>
transmission to a decoder. Naturally, different transmitted up-<br>
mix parameters will result in a different way of calculating<br>
the remaining up-mixing matrix elements. As indicated in<br>
connection with equation (40) or equations (41 - 44), the up-<br>
mix matrix for the energy-directed Fig. 15 embodiment has at<br>
least four non-zero elements, wherein the elements in the third<br>
row are equal to each other. Thus, the parameter calculator<br>
1522 can use any combination of energies L, C, R for example,<br>
from which the four elements in the up-mix matrix such as up-<br>
mix matrix indication (40) or (41) can be derived.<br>
The Fig. 15a embodiment illustrates an encoder, which is<br>
operative to perform the energy-preserving, or, stated in<br>
general, the energy-derived up-mix for the whole bandwidth of a<br>
signal. This means that, on the encoder-side, which is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 15a, the parametric representation output<br>
by the parameter calculator 1522 is generated for the whole<br>
signal. This means that, for each sub-band of the encoded base<br>
channel, a corresponding set of parameters is calculated and<br>
output. When, for example, the encoded base channel, which is,<br>
for example, a full-bandwidth signal having ten sub-bands is<br>
considered, the parameter calculator might output ten<br>
parameters C1 and c2 for each sub-band of the encoded base<br>
channel. When, however, the encoded base channel would be a<br>
low-band signal in an SBR environment, for example only<br>
covering only the five lower sub-bands, then the parameter<br>
calculator 1522 would output a set of parameters for each of<br>
the five lower sub-bands, and, additionally, for each of the<br>
five upper sub-bands, although the signal at output 1508 does<br>
not include a corresponding sub-band. This is due to the fact,<br>
that such a sub-band would be recreated on the decoder-side, as<br>
will be subsequently described in connection with Fig. 16a.<br>
Preferably, however, and as described in connection with Fig.<br>
10, the energy calculator 1520 and the parameter calculator<br>
1522 are only operative for the high-band part of the original<br>
signal, while parameters for the low-band part of the original<br>
signal are calculated by the predictive parameter calculator<br>
104 in Fig. 10, which would correspond to the predictive up-<br>
mixer 109 in Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 15b shows a schematic representation of a parametric<br>
representation output by selection module 1002 in Fig. 10.<br>
Thus, a parametric representation in accordance with the<br>
present invention includes (with or without the encoded base<br>
channel(s) and, optionally, even without the energy measure) a<br>
set of predictive parameters for the low-band, e.g., for the<br>
sub-bands 1 to i and sub-band-wise parameters for the high-<br>
band, e.g., for the sub-bands i+1 to N. Alternatively, the<br>
predictive parameters and the energy style parameters can be<br>
mixed, e.g., that a sub-band having energy style parameters can<br>
be positioned between sub-bands having predictive parameters.<br>
Furthermore, a frame having only predictive parameters can<br>
follow a frame having only energy style parameters. Therefore,<br>
generally stated, the present invention as discussed in<br>
connection with Fig. 10 relates to different parameterisations,<br>
which can be different in the frequency direction as shown in<br>
Fig. 15b or which can be different in the time direction, when<br>
a frame having only predictive parameters is followed by a<br>
frame having only energy style parameters. Naturally, the<br>
distribution or parameterisation of sub-bands can change from<br>
frame to frame, so that, for example, sub-band i has a first<br>
(e.g. predictive) parameter set as shown in Fig. 15b at first<br>
frame, and has a second (e.g. energy style) parameter set in<br>
another frame.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is also useful when<br>
parameterisations different from the predictive<br>
parameterisation as shown in Fig. 14a or the energy style<br>
parameterisation as shown in Fig. 15a are used. Also further<br>
examples for parameterisation apart from predictive or energy<br>
style can be used as soon as any target parameter or target<br>
event indicates that the up-mix quality, the down-mix bit rate,<br>
the computational efficiency on the encoder side or on the<br>
decoder side or, for example, the energy consumption of e.g.<br>
battery-powered devices, etc. say that, for a certain sub-band<br>
or frame, the first parameterisation is better than the second<br>
parameterisation. Naturally, the target function can also be a<br>
combination of different individual targets/events as outlined<br>
above. An exemplary event would be a SBR-reconstructed high<br>
band etc.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be noted that the frequency or time-<br>
selective calculation and transmission of parameters can be<br>
signalled explicitly as shown at 1005 in Fig. 10.<br>
Alternatively, the signalling can also be performed implicitly<br>
such as discussed in connection with Fig. 16a. In this case,<br>
pre-defined rules for the decoder are used, for example that<br>
the decoder automatically assumes that the transmitted<br>
parameters are energy style parameters for sub-bands belonging<br>
to the high-band in Fig. 15b, e.g., for sub-bands, which have<br>
been reconstructed by a spectral band replication or high-<br>
frequency regeneration technique.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be noted that the encoder-side<br>
calculation of one, two or even more different<br>
parameterisations and the encoder-side selection, which<br>
parameterisation is transmitted is based on a decision using<br>
any encoder-side available information (the information can be<br>
an actually used target function or signalling information used<br>
for other reasons such as SBR processing and signalling) can be<br>
performed with or without transmitting the energy measure. Even<br>
when the preferred energy correction is not performed at all,<br>
e.g., when the result of the non-energy-conserving up-mix<br>
(predictive up-mix) is not energy-corrected, or when no<br>
corresponding pre-compensation on the encoder-side is<br>
performed, the preferred switching between different<br>
parameterisations is useful for obtaining a better multi-<br>
channel output quality and/or lower bit rate.<br>
Particularly, the preferred switching between different<br>
parameterisations depending on available encoder-side<br>
information can be used with or without addition of a de-<br>
correlated signal completely or at least partly covering the<br>
energy error performed by the predictive up-mix as shown in<br>
connection with Figs. 5 to 7. In this context, the addition of<br>
a de-correlated signal as described in connection with Fig. 5<br>
is only performed for the sub-bands/frames, for which<br>
predictive up-mix parameters are transmitted, while different<br>
measures for de-correlation are used for those sub-bands or<br>
frames, in which energy style parameters have been transmitted.<br>
Such measures are, for example, down-scaling the wet signal and<br>
generating a de-correlated signal and scaling the de-correlated<br>
signal so that a required amount of de-correlation as, for<br>
example, required by a transmitted inter-channel-correlation<br>
measure such as ICC is obtained, when the properly scaled de-<br>
correlated signals are added to the dry signal.<br>
Subsequently, Fig. 16a is discussed for illustrating a decoder-<br>
side implementation of the preferred up-mixing block 201 and<br>
the corresponding energy correction in 202. As discussed in<br>
connection with Fig. 11, transmitted up-mix parameter 1108 are<br>
extracted from a received input signal. These transmitted up-<br>
mix parameters are preferably input into a calculator 1600 for<br>
calculating the remaining up-mix parameters, when the up-mix<br>
matrix 1602 including energy compensation is to perform a<br>
predictive up-mix and a preceding or subsequent energy<br>
correction. The procedure for calculating the remaining up-mix<br>
parameters is subsequently discussed in connection with Figs.<br>
16b.<br>
The calculation of the up-mix parameters is based on the<br>
equation in Fig. 16b, which is also repeated as equation (7).<br>
In the three-input-signal/two-output-signal embodiment, the<br>
down-mix matrix D has six variables. Additionally, the up-mix<br>
matrix C has also six variables. However, on the right hand<br>
side of equation (7), there are only four values. Therefore, in<br>
case of an unknown down-mix and unknown up-mix, one would have<br>
twelve unknown variables from matrices D and C and only four<br>
equations for determining these twelve variables. However, the<br>
down-mix is known so that the number of variables, which are<br>
unknown reduces to the coefficients of the up-mix matrix C,<br>
which has six variables, although there still exist four<br>
equations for determining these six variables. Therefore, the<br>
optimisation method as discussed in connection with step 1444<br>
in Fig. 14b and as illustrated in Fig. 14a is used for<br>
determining at least two variables of the up-mix matrix, which<br>
are, preferably, C11 and C22. Now, since there exist four<br>
unknowns, e.g., C12, C21, C31 and C32 and since there exist four<br>
equations, e.g., one equation for each element in the identity<br>
matrix I on the right hand side of the equation in Fig. 16b,<br>
the remaining unknown variables of the up-mix matrix can be<br>
calculated in a straight-forward manner. This calculation is<br>
performed in the calculator 1600 for calculating the remaining<br>
up-mix parameters.<br>
The up-mix matrix in the device 1602 is set in accordance with<br>
the two transmitted up-mix parameters as forwarded by broken<br>
line 1604 and by the remaining four up-mix parameters<br>
calculated by block 1600. This up-mix matrix is then applied to<br>
the base channels input via line 1102. Depending on the<br>
implementation, an energy measure for a low-band correction is<br>
forwarded via line 1106 so that a corrected up-mix can be<br>
generated and output. When the predictive up-mix is only<br>
performed for the low-band as, for example, implicitly<br>
signalled via line 1606, and when there exist energy style up-<br>
mix parameters on line 1108 for the high-band, this fact is<br>
signalled, for a corresponding sub-band, to the calculator 1600<br>
and to the up-mix matrix device 1602. In the energy style case,<br>
it is preferred to calculate the up-mix matrix elements of up-<br>
mix matrix (40) or (41). To this end, the transmitted<br>
parameters as indicated below equation (40) or the<br>
corresponding parameters as indicated below equation (41) are<br>
used. In this embodiment, the transmitted up-mix parameters C1,<br>
C2 cannot be directly used for an up-mix coefficient, but the<br>
up-mix coefficients of the up-mix matrix as shown in equation<br>
(40) or (41) have to be calculated using the transmitted up-mix<br>
parameters c1 and c2.<br>
For the high-band, an up-mix matrix as determined for the<br>
energy-based up-mix parameters is used for up-mixing the high-<br>
band part of the multi-channel output signals. Subsequently,<br>
the low-band part and the high-band part are combined in a<br>
low/high combiner 1608 for outputting the full-bandwidth<br>
reconstructed output channels 1, r, c. As illustrated in Fig.<br>
16a, the high-band of the base channels is generated using a<br>
decoder for decoding the transmitted low-band base channels,<br>
wherein this decoder is a mono-decoder for a mono base channel,<br>
and is a stereo decoder for two stereo base channels. This<br>
decoded low-band base channel(s) are input into an SBR device<br>
1614, which additionally receives envelope information as<br>
calculated by device 1512 in Fig. 15a. Based on the low-band<br>
part and the high band envelope information, the high band of<br>
the base channels is generated to obtain full band-width base<br>
channels on the line 1102, which are forwarded into the up-mix<br>
matrix device 1602.<br>
The preferred methods or devices or computer programs can be<br>
implemented or included in several devices. Fig. 17 shows a<br>
transmission system having a transmitter including an inventive<br>
encoder and having a receiver including an inventive decoder.<br>
The transmission channel can be a wireless or wired channel.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 18, the encoder can be included<br>
in an audio recorder or the decoder can be included in an audio<br>
player. Audio records from the audio recorder can be<br>
distributed to the audio player via the Internet or via a<br>
storage medium distributed using mail or courier resources or<br>
other possibilities for distributing storage media such as<br>
memory cards, CDs or DVDs.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented in<br>
hardware or in software. The implementation can be performed<br>
using a digital storage medium, in particular a disk or a CD<br>
having electronically readable control signals stored thereon,<br>
which can cooperate with a programmable computer system such<br>
that the inventive methods are performed. Generally, the<br>
present invention is, therefore, a computer program product<br>
with a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier, the<br>
program code being configured for performing at least one of<br>
the inventive methods, when the computer program products runs<br>
on a computer. In other words, the inventive methods are,<br>
therefore, a computer program having a program code for<br>
performing the inventive methods, when the computer program<br>
runs on a computer.<br>
