CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
60/972,285, filed September 14, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to internal combustion engines, and<br>
more particularly to an acoustic treatment for an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Vehicle internal combustion engines (ICEs) include a variety of moving parts<br>
that create noise during engine operation. As examples, fuel system noise, combustion<br>
noise, and mechanical noise all potentially radiate from an engine's cam cover area.<br>
High combustion pressures, high fuel system pressures, piezo-electric injector noise,<br>
and/or high part clearances (particularly in diesel engines) may increase noise levels in an<br>
engine, which may make it more difficult to attenuate fuel system noise, combustion<br>
noise, and mechanical noise. As an example, noise may be created when combustion<br>
pressures having a high rate of pressure change result in large dynamic loads on engine<br>
structures. Further, ICEs are often equipped with engine components that extend through<br>
particularly noisy areas of the engine, the placement of which generally increases the<br>
difficulty associated with designing and executing an efficient engine acoustic treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] An example embodiment of an acoustic treatment for an engine. The engine<br>
has at least one engine component extending substantially therefrom. The acoustic<br>
treatment includes a base layer with a first base surface and an opposing second base<br>
surface. The first base surface is configured to mate with an exterior surface of the<br>
engine. The example acoustic treatment also includes a secondary layer having a<br><br><br><br>
secondary layer mating surface and an opposing secondary layer outer surface. The<br>
secondary layer mating surface is configured to mate with the second base surface at a<br>
mating interface. The mating interface provides a pass-through location for the at least<br>
one engine component.<br>
[0005] The above features and advantages of the present invention will be readily<br>
apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and best<br>
modes for carrying out the present invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

acoustic treatment to an engine.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] Embodiment (s) of the system and method disclosed herein advantageously<br>
provide an acoustic treatment for an engine, such as an internal combustion engine.<br>
The disclosed embodiment(s) advantageously reduce noise emissions from the engine.<br>
More specifically, acoustic sealing, as provided by embodiment(s) of the system and<br>
method, attenuate fuel system "tic," combustion noise, and/or mechanical noise. It is<br>
believed that such a method and/or system may provide for improved vehicle<br>
performance and/or operator satisfaction by limiting the amount of noise emitted from<br>
the engine.<br><br><br>
[0012] Referring to Figures 1 and 2, an example embodiment of an engine acoustic<br>
treatment 10 for an engine 14, for example an internal combustion engine (ICE)<br>
assembly, is depicted. The engine acoustic treatment 10 includes a base layer 18, a<br>
secondary layer 22, and an optional shell 26. The acoustic treatment 10 is indicated in<br>
Figure 1, however Figure 1 illustrates only the base layer 18 of the acoustic treatment<br>
and not the secondary layer 22. Although the acoustic treatment 10 is described herein<br>
with respect to an engine 14, it is to be understood that the treatment 10 may be utilized<br>
to attenuate noise in any suitable engine or device.<br>
[0013] The base layer 18 includes a first base surface 30 and an opposing second<br>
base surface 34. The first base surface 30 is configured to mate with a suitable surface<br>
of engine 14, for example an engine top surface 16. As non-limiting examples, the first<br>
base surface 30 may be configured to mate with a cam cover, a cylinder head, a fuel<br>
rail bracket, and/or another engine surface, such as an engine front, side, bottom,<br>
and/or V. As used herein, "mate" is to be interpreted broadly to include substantially<br>
aligning with or affixing thereto, either removably or non-removably, and may refer to<br>
nesting one surface with another having a complimentary contour.<br>
[0014] In one example embodiment, the base layer 18 is formed from a<br>
substantially deformable material, including, but not limited to, foam, plastic, rubber,<br>
or a polymer such as polyurethane. In the example embodiment, the base layer 18 is<br>
mated with the exterior surface 16 of the engine via a press-fit, wherein the base layer<br>
18 is placed between the engine 14 and one or more engine components 38. The<br>
engine component(s) 38 may include any combination of components, including, but<br>
not limited to, wires (e.g., electrical wires), lines (e.g., fuel, water, or other liquid<br>
lines), fittings (e.g., wiring harnesses), brackets, and/or fuel rails extending<br>
substantially from the engine 14.<br>
[0015] When press-fit into place, the base layer 18 is frictionally held in place by<br>
the engine components 38. As used herein, a press-fit configuration is achieved by<br>
mating the base layer 18 with the exterior surface 16 before assembling components<br>
(e.g., engine components 38) over the base layer 18.<br><br><br>
[0016] In another example embodiment, the base layer 18 and/or the engine 14 is<br>
equipped with a positive fastener 40 (shown here as a box to identify a potential<br>
location) capable of releasably or non-releasably affixing the base layer 18 to the engine<br>
14. As non-limiting examples, the fastener may include a hook and loop, a snap, a<br>
rivet, a screw, a bolt, a pin, a nail, a retaining ring, a snap ring, a ball and socket, a<br>
pushpin, a Christmas tree, and/or any other suitable apparatus.<br>
[0017| The base layer 18 has a substantially frame-shaped configuration, which is to<br>
be interpreted broadly to include a formation having a substantially open central region<br>
(or aperture). The base layer 18 is configured to mate substantially around a perimeter<br>
of the engine 14 cam cover.<br>
[0018] As non-limiting examples, the base layer 18 may be substantially O-shaped,<br>
square, rectangular, C-shaped, or L-shaped. It is to be understood with respect to a<br>
frame-shaped configuration that an "open central region" merely indicates that some<br>
amount of base layer 18 "frame" surrounds an open space. It does not, however,<br>
necessitate that the open region must be geometrically centered in the base layer 18.<br>
[0019] As depicted in Figure 2, the secondary layer 22 includes a secondary layer<br>
mating surface 42 and an opposing secondary layer outer surface 46. The secondary<br>
layer mating surface 42 is configured to mate with the second base surface 34 at a mating<br>
interface 50, as depicted in Figure 3. The secondary layer 22 may have a closed<br>
configuration.<br>
[0020] As used herein, with respect to the secondary layer 22, the term "closed'" is to<br>
be interpreted broadly to indicate a secondary layer 22 having a substantially solid<br>
configuration, unlike the open frame-shaped configuration described hcrcinabovc.<br>
Accordingly, the base layer 1 8 is somewhat like a picture frame around the perimeter of a<br>
cam cover or other noise-generating component, and the secondary layer 22 is "closed"<br>
(i.e. not having any large through-holes) such that it "closes" the central opening of the<br>
somewhat picture frame-shaped base layer 18 to trap noise. However, it is to be<br>
understood that the base layer 18 and/or the secondary layer 22 may have any suitable<br>
shape, including, for example, a closed base layer 18 and/or a frame-shaped secondary<br>
layer 22.<br><br><br>
[0021] Referring to Figure 3A, the mating interface 50 provides a pass-through<br>
location for the engine components 38. More specifically, the mating interface 50<br>
permits engine components 38 to "pass through" the acoustic treatment 10 (i.e. between<br>
the base layer 1 8 and the secondary layer 22 as illustrated in Figure 2) while retaining a<br>
substantially acoustically-sealed configuration. It is recognized that such an acoustically-<br>
sealed configuration having substantially no gaps or cracks reduces noise leakage and<br>
improves the high frequency attenuation of the acoustic treatment 10.<br>
[0022]	In another example embodiment, the base layer 18 and/or the secondary layer<br>
22 are at least partially formed from a deformable material. In the example embodiment,<br>
the engine components 38 pass through the mating interface 50 by distorting the<br>
deformable material at each specific pass-through location while retaining a substantial<br>
acoustic seal.<br>
[0023] In yet another example embodiment, the base layer 18 and/or the secondary<br>
layer 22, whether produced from a substantially deformable or non-deformable material,<br>
is contoured at one or more specific pass-through locations on the mating surface 50. As<br>
such, the layer(s) 1 8, 22 may have a contoured portion 52 (i.e., notch or cutout), as<br>
depicted in Figure 2, at the location where an engine component 38 passes through the<br>
acoustic treatment 10. Thus, mating the secondary layer mating surface 42 with the<br>
second base surface 34 includes aligning the engine components 38 with a contoured<br>
portion 52. Such contouring of the base layer 18 and/or secondary layer 22 may prevent<br>
substantial deformation of the layers 18, 22 at the pass-through locations.<br>
|0024] A layer 18, 22 may include contoured portions 52 only at the pass-through<br>
locations used for a specific engine 14 configuration (i.e., with respect to the location of<br>
engine components 38) or, alternatively, a layer 18, 22 may be interchangeable between<br>
engine 14 configurations by including contoured portions 52 from more than one engine<br>
14 configuration. When employing the interchangeable layer 18, 22, it is to be<br>
understood that contoured portions 52 may be designed to prevent a substantial gap in the<br>
acoustic treatment's 10 seal, even if one or more contoured portions 52 are unused with a<br>
specific engine 14 configuration.<br>
|0025] Referring generally now to Figures 1-3 A, the acoustic treatment 10 may<br>
include the optional shell 26, which substantially covers the secondary layer 22 and,<br><br><br>
further, may cover at least a portion of the base layer 1 8. The shell 26 nests with the<br>
secondary layer 22 such that a First shell surface 54 mates with the secondary layer outer<br>
surface 46. The shell 26 is formed from any suitable material that is sufficiently dense to<br>
act as an acoustic barrier. As non-limiting examples, the shell 26 may be formed from a<br>
material such as, for example, plastic, fiberglass, rubber, or a polymer such as<br>
polyurethane. The shell 26 may be formed from a deformable or non-deformable<br>
material. In another example embodiment, the shell 26 is formed from a material having<br>
more rigidity and/or a higher density than the base layer 18 and/or the secondary layer 22.<br>
[0026] The shell 26 is configured to provide an acoustic barrier to the acoustic<br>
treatment 10 by further reducing noise passing therethrough and may be configured to<br>
provide structural support to the acoustic treatment 10. The shell 26 may also be<br>
configured to maintain the placement of the secondary layer 22 with respect to the engine<br>
14. As such, the shell 26 and/or the engine 14 may be configured with a positive fastener<br>
56 (shown here as a box to identify a potential location) to affix the shell 26, releasably<br>
or non-releasably, to the engine 14 while holding the secondary layer 22 substantially in<br>
place. The shell 26 may also be configured to provide thermal protection to the base<br>
layer 18 and/or the secondary layer 22. As such, the shell 26 may have a higher<br>
temperature resistance than at least one of the layers 1 8, 22.<br>
[0027] The placement of the shell 26 with respect to the engine 14 may provide for a<br>
relatively large "air gap" between the first shell surface 54 and the engine exterior surface<br>
16. The air gap may range from about 0.10 Inch to about 20 inches. More specifically,<br>
the air gap may range from about 2 inches to about 4 inches.<br>
[0028] In one example embodiment, the air gap is approximately 3 inches. It is<br>
recognized that an acoustic treatment 1 0 with a relatively large air gap may<br>
advantageously provide for improved low frequency attenuation with respect to a<br>
configuration with a smaller air gap or no air gap. The acoustic treatment 1 0<br>
substantially reduces the emission of noise at frequency levels as low as approximately<br>
500 Hertz (Hz) and may attenuate noise at frequency levels as low as approximately 300<br>
Hertz (Hz). With respect to high frequency noise, the acoustic treatment 10 may reduce<br>
the emission of noise at frequencies up to approximately 20 kiloHertz (kHz).<br><br><br>
[0029] Figure 4 schematically depicts a method of applying an acoustic treatment 10<br>
to an engine 14 having at least one of an engine component 38 extending substantially<br>
therefrom. The method includes mating a first base surface 30 of a substantially frame-<br>
shaped base layer 18 with an exterior surface 16 of an engine 14, as depicted at<br>
reference numeral 102. Further, the method includes mating a secondary layer mating<br>
surface 42 of a secondary layer 22 with a second base surface 34 of the base layer 18,<br>
opposed from the first base surface 30, as depicted at reference numeral 106. In the<br>
example embodiment of Figure 4, at least one of the engine components 38 passes<br>
between the base layer 18 and the secondary layer 22.<br>
[0030] The method also includes mating a first shell surface 54 of a closed shell 26<br>
with a secondary layer outer surface 46, opposed from the secondary layer mating<br>
surface 42, as depicted at reference numeral 110. The method may also include the<br>
step of attaching the first shell surface 54 to the engine 14 with a positive fastener 56,<br>
as depicted at reference numeral 114. The shell 26 may be mated with the secondary<br>
layer 22 after the secondary layer 22 is mated with the base layer 18 or, alternatively,<br>
the secondary layer 22 may be mated with the shell 26 before the secondary layer 22 is<br>
mated with the base layer 18.<br>
[0031] It is to be understood that the term "top" is used herein to describe direction<br>
with respect to Figures 1-3A and is not to be used as a limiting term. As such, the term<br>
"top" is not to restrict the orientation of the acoustic treatment 10 and engine 14 during<br>
manufacture or use.<br>
