				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to apparatuses such as a television<br>
signal processing apparatus, that comprise multiple tuners and receive auxiliary data<br>
such as administrative data, program guide information or emergency alert signals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to apparatuses such as a television<br>
signal processing apparatus that comprise multiple tuners and receive auxiliary data<br>
such as administrative data, program guide information or emergency alert signals.<br>
Modern signal processing apparatus typically include signal processing<br>
circuitry for processing a multitude of signal formats, such as NTSC, ATSC, QAM, or<br>
satellite signals. Such a signal processing apparatus typically includes various<br>
components such as a tuner for selecting a particular signal or channel from a<br>
plurality of signals or channels received by the apparatus. To process digital signals,<br>
such as ATSC or satellite signals, the signal processing circuitry, and in particular the<br>
tuner, must perform these functions with high-speed digital circuitry. A potential<br>
undesirable result of high-speed signal processing is that temperature rise of<br>
components used in the signal processing apparatus may approach or exceed<br>
reliability limits. It is desirable to reduce the overall operating temperature of the<br>
signal processing apparatus when possible to increase the reliability of the signal<br>
processing apparatus and to reduce power consumption of the signal processing<br>
apparatus during operation.<br>
Signal processing apparatus have various modes of operation depending on<br>
its state of use. For example, a signal processing apparatus is in an off mode when it<br>
is completely disconnected from a power source. The signal processing apparatus<br>
may have a standby mode of operation wherein it is connected to a power source and<br>
capable of tuning and receiving particular signals or channels, storing auxiliary data<br>
transmitted via these signals or channels, and receiving and processing remote<br>
control commands, such as an "on" command, but not operational for producing<br>
audio or video output signals. Furthermore, during an on mode of operation the<br>
system is fully operational and normally all components are powered and fans can be<br>
used to cool the signal processing apparatus. During certain modes of operation<br>
certain system components may be disabled to reduce power consumption and<br>
noise. In particular, components such as a cooling fan intended to minimize<br>
excessive temperature rise of components may be disabled. As a result, component<br>
heating may be exacerbated during a mode of operation such as "standby" mode.<br>
However, it is not possible to remove power to all components during standby mode<br>
as the signal processing apparatus is still required to tune and receiving particular<br>
signals or channels, store auxiliary data transmitted via these signals or channels,<br>
and receive and process remote control commands. In particular it is desirable to<br>
reduce the heat generated by high speed signal processing circuitry associated with<br>
the tuners while continuing to receive auxiliary data such as administrative data,<br>
guide data, or emergency alert notifications.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a television signal<br>
processing system having a first tuner and a second tuner is disclosed. The present<br>
invention solves the described problem providing a switching circuit responsive to a<br>
processing means for causing the power supplied to the first tuner to be removed<br>
while causing the power to the second tuner to continue to be supplied during one or<br>
more modes of operation of the system thereby reducing heat generation and<br>
extending the overall life of the product. As a specific example, by disconnecting the<br>
main power supplies to the first tuner, internal self-heating of the tuner and<br>
subsequent heating of the signal processing apparatus is reduced during the standby<br>
mode while maintaining the desirable capabilities of continuing to receive auxiliary<br>
data.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The exemplifications set out herein illustrate preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, an exemplary<br>
environment 100 suitable for implementing the present invention is shown. In FIG. 1,<br>
environment 100 comprises signal transmission means such as signal transmission<br>
source 10, dwelling means such as dwelling units 15 (i.e., 1, 2, 3 . . . N, where N may<br>
be any positive integer), and signal receiving means such as television signal<br>
processing apparatus 200.<br>
In FIG. 1, dwelling units 15 may represent residences, businesses and/or other<br>
dwelling places located within a particular geographical area, such as but not limited<br>
to, a particular continent, country, region, state, area code, zip code, city, county,<br>
municipality, subdivision, and/or other definable geographical area. According to an<br>
exemplary embodiment, each of the dwelling units 15 is equipped with at least one<br>
television signal processing apparatus 200. The present invention, enables the<br>
television signal processing apparatus 200 to receive information such as auxiliary<br>
data, program guide data, or emergency alert signals when the television signal<br>
processing apparatus 200 is in the standby mode while reducing the amount of heat<br>
generated by the television signal processing apparatus 200.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment, the on mode is an operational mode<br>
where television signal processing apparatus 200 is turned on (i.e., providing audio<br>
and/or video outputs), while the off/standby mode is an operational mode where<br>
television signal processing apparatus 200 is turned off (i.e., no audio and/or video<br>
outputs) but still receives electrical power. Television signal processing apparatus<br>
200 may for example be switched from the off/standby mode to the on mode<br>
responsive to a user input.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of the television signal processing apparatus<br>
200, such as a color television receiver or video signal processing apparatus, that<br>
includes capability for simultaneously processing both first and second video signals<br>
and for processing auxiliary information. As an example, some video signal<br>
processing systems receive and process a first video signal to produce a first output<br>
signal representing a first, or "main", image and receive and process a second video<br>
signal to produce a second output signal representing a second or auxiliary image.<br>
The first and second output signals may be coupled to a display device to produce a<br>
displayed image including both the main image and the auxiliary image. A specific<br>
example of such systems is a picture-in-picture (PIP) or picture-outside-picture (POP)<br>
television system. Such systems may, for example, include first and second tuners<br>
for simultaneously and independently selecting the respective first and second video<br>
signals that will be processed to produce the respective first and second imagerepresentative<br>
output signals. In such systems, e.g., a color television receiver with<br>
PIP capability, it may also be desirable to provide for receiving and processing<br>
auxiliary information. For example, in addition to receiving video and audio signals<br>
associated with television programming, it may also be desirable to receive auxiliary<br>
information such as guide data, that can be processed to produce an on-screendisplay<br>
(OSD) such as an electronic program guide (EPG) to simplify and facilitate<br>
user interaction with the television receiver. In addition to providing a picture in<br>
picture display on the TV screen the PIP tuner, when the TV is in standby mode, may<br>
be used for EPG data collection. To receive and process auxiliary information such<br>
as EPG data, the tuner must receive power and be operational so that the channel or<br>
signal carrying the data can be selected and provided to the signal processing<br>
circuitry. To provide the capability to receive and process auxiliary data while also<br>
solving the above-described component heating problem, the system may provide for<br>
removing power from a first, possibly more complex tuner, while maintaining power to<br>
a second, possibly less complex, second tuner during standby mode.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, to provide the capability to receive and<br>
process auxiliary data while also solving the above-described component heating<br>
problem, the system may provide for removing power from a first, possibly more<br>
complex tuner, while applying power to a second, possibly less complex tuner, for a<br>
particular time period during standby mode, such as an interval or portion of the<br>
standby period, during which the auxiliary information can be collected and<br>
processed. For example, a control device such as a microprocessor included in the<br>
system responds to activation of a particular mode of operation such as standby<br>
mode by activating a process for controlling power to the tuner. The process includes<br>
turning a single tuner on for a particular amount of time to collect data and then turn<br>
the single tuner off. This exemplary embodiment of the invention may have a duty<br>
cycle may be around 30% during the standby period. The time period or frequency of<br>
the power-on data-collection intervals may be varied in response to various factors.<br>
For example, the tuner on-time may be varied in response to component temperature<br>
and thereby be on for longer periods as long as temperature is within acceptable<br>
limits. Tuner on-time might also be varied in response to the amount of data to be<br>
collected or the data rate. For example, the on-time of the tuner is increased if more<br>
data must be received and processed or if a slower data rate requires more<br>
processing time, as long as component temperatures are acceptable.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of television<br>
signal processing apparatus 200 of FIG. 1 is shown. In FIG. 2, television signal<br>
processing apparatus 200 comprises signal receiving means such as signal receiving<br>
element 210, signal splitting means such as signal splitter 220, first tuning means<br>
such as tuner 230, first demodulation means such as demodulator 240, second<br>
tuning means such as second tuner 250, second demodulation means such as<br>
demodulator 260, decoding means such as decoder 270, processing means and<br>
memory means such as processor and memory 280, audio amplification means such<br>
as audio amplifier 290, audio output means such as speaker 235, video processing<br>
means such as video processor 245, and visual output means such as display 255, a<br>
power supply 225 and a switch 215 responsive to said processor and memory 280.<br>
Some of the foregoing elements may for example be embodied using integrated<br>
circuits (ICs). For clarity of description, certain conventional elements of television<br>
signal processing apparatus 200 including control signals may not be shown in FIG.<br>
2. According to an exemplary embodiment, television signal processing apparatus<br>
200 may receive and process signals in analog and/or digital formats.<br>
Signal receiving element 210 is operative to receive signals including audio,<br>
video and/or auxiliary data from signal sources, such as signal transmission source<br>
10 in FIG. 1. Signal receiving element 210 may be embodied as any signal receiving<br>
element such as an antenna, input terminal or other element.<br>
Signal splitter 220 is operative to split the signals provided from signal<br>
receiving element 210 into first and second frequency channels. According to an<br>
exemplary embodiment, television signal processing apparatus 200 may include a<br>
picture-in-picture (PIP) function wherein the first channel includes audio and/or video<br>
signals for a main picture, and the second channel includes audio and/or video<br>
signals for the PIP function.<br>
Tuner 230 is operative to tune signals including audio, video and/or auxiliary<br>
data signals in the first channel when television signal processing apparatus 200 is in<br>
the on mode. Accordingly, tuner 230 may tune signals for the main picture of<br>
television signal processing apparatus 200. Demodulator 240 is operative to<br>
demodulate signals provided from tuner 230, and may demodulate signals in analog<br>
and/or digital transmission formats.<br>
Tuner 250 is operative to tune signals including audio, video and/or auxiliary<br>
data signals in the second channel when television signal processing apparatus 200<br>
is in the on mode. Accordingly, tuner 250 may tune signals for the PIP function of<br>
television signal processing apparatus 200. Additionally, tuner 250 is operative to<br>
tune signals including auxiliary data signals in the second channel when television<br>
signal processing apparatus 200 is in the standby mode. In this manner, tuner 250<br>
enables television signal processing apparatus 200 to receive emergency alert<br>
signals in both the on mode and the standby mode. Demodulator 260 is operative to<br>
demodulate signals provided from tuner 250, and may demodulate signals in analog<br>
and/or digital transmission formats.<br>
Switch 215 is operative to facilitate a connection or a disconnection between<br>
the power supply 225 and the first tuner 230 and the second tuner 250. The switch<br>
215 is responsive to control signals from the processor 280. Such control signals<br>
may enable the switch to provide power or remove power from either tuner 230, 250<br>
' and any combination of tuners as prescribed by the processor 280 in response power<br>
state, such as on or standby, the preprogrammed duty cycle of the tuners 230, 250,<br>
the required tasks to be performed by the processor 280, such as receiving auxiliary<br>
data, or optionally, to the operating temperature of the signal processing circuitry or to<br>
enable other operations of the television signal processing apparatus 200, such as<br>
causing it to be switched from the off/standby mode to the on mode. Further details<br>
regarding these aspects of the present invention will be provided later herein.<br>
Decoder 270 is operative to decode signals including audio, video and/or<br>
auxiliary data signals provided from demodulators 240 and 260. According to an<br>
exemplary embodiment, decoder 270 decodes digital data that represents emergency<br>
alert signals indicating an emergency event. Decoder 270 may also perform other<br>
decoding functions, such as decoding data which represents auxiliary data signals<br>
included in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of an analog television signal. An<br>
example of an auxiliary data signal according to an exemplary embodiment, may<br>
include emergency alert signals include data comprising Specific Area Message<br>
Encoding (SAME) data associated with the emergency event. SAME data comprises<br>
a digital code representing information such as the specific geographical area<br>
affected by the emergency event, the type of emergency event (e.g., tornado watch,<br>
radiological hazard warning, civil emergency, etc.), and the expiration time of the<br>
event alert. SAME data is used by the National Weather Service (NWS) and other<br>
authorities to improve the specificity of emergency alerts and to decrease the<br>
frequency of false alerts. Other data and information may also be included in the<br>
emergency alert signals according to the present invention.<br>
Processor and memory 280 are operative to perform various processing,<br>
control, and data storage functions of television signal processing apparatus 200.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment, processor 280 is operative to process the<br>
audio and video signals provided from decoder 270, and may for example perform<br>
analog processing, such as National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) signal<br>
processing and/or digital processing, such as Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG)<br>
processing.<br>
The processor and memory 280 is also operative to receive the auxiliary data<br>
signals from decoder 270 and determine what actions are required based on the<br>
auxiliary data received. For example, if EPG data is received, the processor 280 may<br>
decide to sort the EPG data and store the data in the processor's associated memory<br>
280. If the processor 280 receives auxiliary data associated with the emergency alert<br>
function of television signal processing apparatus 200, it may compare data in the<br>
emergency alert signals to user setup data stored in memory 280 to determine<br>
whether the emergency alert function is activated to activate emergency alert signals.<br>
Audio amplifier 290 is operative to amplify the audio signals provided from<br>
processor 280. Speaker 235 is operative to aurally output the amplified audio signals<br>
provided from audio amplifier 290.<br>
Video processor 245 is operative to process the video signals provided from<br>
processor 280. According to an exemplary embodiment, such video signals may<br>
include information based on the data contained in the received auxiliary data signals<br>
such as EPG information or emergency alert information. Video processor 245 may<br>
include closed caption circuitry that enables closed caption displays. Display 255 is<br>
operative to provide visual displays corresponding to processed signals provided from<br>
video processor 245.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of switching<br>
arrangement for the power supply 340 to the tuners 310, 320 and an optional fan 360<br>
is shown. In the exemplary embodiment depicted in Fig. 3, when the television signal<br>
processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 2 is ON, or in the normal operating mode, a fan may<br>
be used to reduce heat build up in the television signal processing apparatus 200 of<br>
Fig. 2. During standby mode, when the television signal processing apparatus 200 of<br>
Fig. 2 is still connected to a household power supply, but the television signal<br>
processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 2 is not in use and the video display 255 of Fig. 2<br>
and the audio amplifier 290 of Fig. 2 are turned off, it is also desirable to remove<br>
power to the fan 360 to limit the noise created by the television signal processing<br>
apparatus 200 of Fig. 2 to avoid excess ambient noise. In order to disconnect the<br>
power supply 340 from either the first tuner 310 or the second tuner 320 or the fan<br>
360, the processor 350 sends a control signal to the switch 330. The processor 350<br>
can send the control signal to the switch 330 to alter the power provided to the tuners<br>
310, 320 and the fan 360 based on a number of events or criteria. The control signal<br>
can be sent in response to a user command made via a remote control (not shown) to<br>
put the television signal processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 2 in a standby mode. The<br>
control signal can also be sent based on a preprogrammed duty cycle determined by<br>
the product designers which is optimized to keep the television signal processing<br>
apparatus operating below an optimal temperature, while still enabling the tuner to<br>
receiver auxiliary data when required.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of switching<br>
arrangement for the power supply 440 to the tuners 410, 420 is shown, which further<br>
comprises a temperature sensor 460 which permits the processor 450 to alter the<br>
duty cycle of the tuners 410, 420 based on the temperature of television receiving<br>
apparatus 200 of Fig. 2. The temperature measured by the temperature sensor 460<br>
may include the ambient temperature inside of the television signal processing<br>
apparatus 200 of Fig. 2, the temperature of a component or integrated circuit inside<br>
the television signal processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 2, either of the tuners 410, 420<br>
or any combination of these temperatures. In this embodiment a fan, such as the fan<br>
360 of Fig. 3, can also be used and controlled by the processor 450 to control the<br>
temperature of the television signal processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 2 in the various<br>
modes of operation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
switching circuitry 500, such as the switch 215 of Fig. 2, is shown. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment depicted in Fig. 5, in order to turn off the power supply V1 to the tuner<br>
230 of Fig. 2, a control signal (TUN1-CNTL) is provided. The state of this control<br>
signal is determined by the processor 280 of Fig. 2, which has sufficient information<br>
from various inputs, such as a "power off' signal received from a remote control (not<br>
shown) to know when the television signal processing apparatus 200 of Fig. 1 should<br>
be put into standby mode. To reduce unnecessary heat generation in the standby<br>
mode, two transistor switches 510, 520 are used operate a third transistor 530 to<br>
disconnect the first power supply (V1) from the tuner (Tuner A). The control signal<br>
goes high in the on mode and turns ON the first transistor switch 510, which in this<br>
exemplary embodiment is an NPN transistor. The first transistor switch 510 then<br>
causes the second transistor switch 520, which in this exemplary embodiment is a<br>
PNP transistor, to turn ON. When the second transistor switch 520 turns ON, it<br>
applies the correct gate bias voltage to the third transistor 530 to turn ON the third<br>
transistor 530. In this exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a FET<br>
transistor is used as the third transistor 530. Through a resistive divider network R1,<br>
R2, R3, the appropriate drive voltage to the third transistor 530 can be set-up. By the<br>
use of this divider network R1, R2, R3, the voltage applied to the gate of the third<br>
Transistor switch 530 is correct for a second power supply V2 to be used and not<br>
overdrive the gate to source voltage. By the use of the low cost FET transistors for<br>
the third transistor 530, 96 % of the tuner power dissipated is removed in the standby<br>
mode. FET transistors are used over bipolar switches in order to minimize the<br>
amount of power required to turn the tuner ON or OFF. In order to power a fan 540<br>
during the on mode, the fan 540 can be connected to the switching circuitry 500 at an<br>
appropriate point to provide the correct input power and proper operating state for<br>
each of the operating modes. In the exemplary embodiment, a second resistor<br>
network R4, R5 is used to provide the appropriate bias voltage level to transistor 520.<br>
In on mode, the first transistor 510 is turned on, and the input voltage to the fan is<br>
dropped to zero and thus turns the fan 540 on. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
depicted in Fig. 5, switching circuitry to control the power to a single device is shown.<br>
In order to control multiple devices independently, multiple implementations of the<br>
