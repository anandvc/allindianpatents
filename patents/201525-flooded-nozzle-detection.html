				<td>FLOODED NOZZLE DETECTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to printed media production and in particular Inkjet printers.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Inkjet printers are a well-known and widely used form of printed media production. Ink is fed to an array of micro-processor controlled nozzles on a printhead. As the print head passes over the media, ink is ejected from the array of nozzles to produce an image on the media.<br>
Printer performance depends on factors such as operating cost, print quality, operating speed and ease of use. The mass, frequency and velocity of individual ink drops ejected from the nozzles will affect these performance parameters.<br>
Recently, the array of nozzles has been formed using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which have mechanical structures with sub-micron thicknesses. This allows the production of printheads that can rapidly eject ink droplets sized in the picolitre (x 10'*^ litre) range.<br>
While the microscopic structures of these printheads can provide high speeds and good print quality at relatively low costs, their size makes the nozzles extremely fragile and vulnerable to damage from the slightest contact with fingers, dust or the media substrate. This can make the printheads impractical for many applications where a certain level of robustness is necessary. Furthermore, a damaged nozzle may misdirect the ejected drops or simply fail to eject the ink at all. If the nozzle fails to eject the ink, it can start to bead and affect surrounding nozzles. In time, it may also leak ink onto the printed substrate.<br>
Whether the ejected ink is misdirected or the ink beads on the surface of the printhead, both situations are detrimental to print quality. To address this, the printhead can be provided with an apertured guard over the exterior of the nozzles to avoid damaging contact fingers, dust or the media. However, the guard may also be used to retain misdirected ink droplets or any ink leaked from damaged nozzles. By localizing any ink leakage, the number of nozzles affected can be limited. The guard also prevents misdirected ink droplets from reaching the media.<br>
Unfortunately, the print quality still suffers because it no longer includes the ink from the damaged nozzles. Furthermore, as the containment formation fills with ink, it can still bead on the exterior of the guard to clog the surrounding apertures and or leak onto the media.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a printhead for an ink jet printer, the printhead including:<br>
a substrate carrying an array of nozzles for ejecting ink onto media to be printed;<br>
an apertured guard positioned over at least one of the nozzles such that ejected ink passes through an aperture and onto the media;<br>
the guard and the nozzle at least partially defing a containment formation for isolating leaked or misdirected ink from the nozzle from at least some of the other nozzles in the array; and<br>
means to detect a predetermined amount of ink in the containment formation and stop further supply of ink to the nozzle.<br>
In this specification the term "nozzle" is to be understood as an element defining an opening and not the opening itself.<br>
Preferably, each nozzle in the array has a respective containment formation to isolate it from all the other nozzles in the array and each of the containment fonnations has one of said detection means. However, some forms of the invention may have a containment formation configured for isolating predetennined groups of nozzles from the other nozzles in the array; wherein<br>
the detection means associated with each of the containment formations is configured to stop further supply of ink to the predetermined group upon sensing a predetermined level of ink in the containment fonnation.<br>
In one form, each of the nozzles use a bend actuator attached to a paddle for ejecting ink wherein the detection means disables the bend actuator to stop further supply of ink to the nozzle.<br>
In a preferred form, the detection means has a pair of electrical contacts positioned in the containment formation such that an accumulation of the predetermined amount of ink closes an electrical circuit such that a comparator disables the actuator.<br>
In some embodiments, the containment formation further includes containment walls extending from the guard to the exterior of each of the nozzles. In a further preferred form, the nozzle guard is formed from silicon.<br>
In one particularly preferred form, the detection means provides feedback for a fault tolerance facility to adjust the operation of other nozzles with the array to compensate for the damaged nozzle.<br>
An ink jet printer printhead according to the present invention, not only isolates any ink leakage such that it is contained to a single nozzle or group of nozzles, but senses the accumulation of ink and stops further supply to that nozzle or group of nozzles. This prevents the supply of ink to damaged nozzles to go unchecked.<br><br>
The containment walls necessarily use up a proportion of the surface area of the printhead, and this adversely affects the nozzle packing density. The extra printhead chip area required can add 20% to the costs of manufacturing the chip. However, in situations where nozzle manufacture is unreliable, the present invention will maintain print quality despite a relatively high nozzle defect rate.<br>
The nozzle guard may further include fluid inlet openings for directing fluid through the apertures to inhibit the build up of foreign particles on the nozzle array.<br>
The fluid inlet openings may be positioned remote from a bond pad of the nozzle array.<br>
By providing a nozzle guard for the printhead, the nozzle structures can be protected from being touched or bumped against most other surfaces. To optinoize the protection provided, the guard forms a flat shield covering the exterior side of the nozzles and has an array of apertures big enough to allow the ejection of ink droplets but small enough to prevent inadvertent contact or the ingress of most dust particles. By forming the shield from silicon, its coefficient of thermal expansion substantially matches that of the nozzle array. This will help to prevent the array of apertures in the shield from falling out of register with the nozzle array as the printhead heats up to it operating temperature. Using silicon also allows the shield to be accurately niicro-machined using MEMS techniques. Furthermore, silicon is very strong and substantially non-deformable.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the drawings, a nozzle assembly, in accordance with the invention is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. An Inkjet printhead has a plurality of nozzle assemblies 10 arranged b an array 14 (Figures S and 6) on a silicon substrate 16. The array 14 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The assembly 10 includes a silicon substrate 16 on which a dielectric layer 18 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 20 is deposited on the dielectric layer 18.<br>
Each nozzle assembly 10 includes a nozzle 22 defining a nozzle opening 24, a connecting member in the fomi of a lever aim 26 and an actuator 28. The lever arm 26 connects the actuator 28 to the nozzle 22.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figures 2 to 4, the nozzle 22 comprises a crown portion 30 with a skirt portion 32 depending from the crown portion 30. The skirt portion 32 forais part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 34. The nozzle opening 24 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 34. It is to be noted that the nozzle opening 24 is surrounded by a raised rim 36 which "pins" a meniscus 38 (Figure 2) of a body of ink 40 in the nozzle chamber 34.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 42 (shown most clearly in Figure 6 of the drawings) is defined in a floor 46 of the nozzle chamber 34. The aperture 42 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 48 defined through the substrate 16.<br>
A wall portion 50 bounds the aperture 42 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 46. The skirt portion 32, as indicated above, of the nozzle 22 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 34 and the wall portion 50 defines a second part of the peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 34.<br>
The wall 50 has an inwardly directed lip 52 at its free end which serves as a fluidic seal which inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 22 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below. It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 40 and the small dimensions of the spacing between the lip 52 and the skirt portion 32, the inwardly directed lip 52 and surface tension function as an effective seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 34.<br><br>
The actuator 28 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 54 extending upwardly from the substrate 16 or, more particulariy from the CMOS passivation layer 20. The anchor 54 is mounted on conductive pads 56 which form an electrical connection with the actuator 28.<br>
The actuator 28 comprises a first, active beam 58 arranged above a second, passive beam 60. In a preferred embodiment, both beams 58 and 60 are of. or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both beams 58 and 60 have their first ends anchored to the anchor 54 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 26. When a current is caused to flow through the active beam 58 thermal expansion of the beam 58 results. As the passive beam 60, through which there is no current flow, does not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the armt 26 and, hence, the nozzle 22 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 16 as shown in Figure 3. This causes an ejection of ink through the nozzle opening 24 as shown at 62. When the source of heat is removed from the active beam 58, i.e. by stopping current flow, the nozzle 22 returns to its quiescent position as shown in Figure 4. When the nozzle 22 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 64 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 66 in Figure 4. The ink droplet 64 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 64, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 68 in Figure 4 of the drawings. This "negadve" meniscus 68 results in an inflow of ink 40 into the nozzle chamber 34 such that a new meniscus 38 (Figure 2) is formed in readiness for the next ink drop ejection from the nozzle assembly 10.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings, the nozzle array 14 is described in greater detail. The array 14 is for a four color printhead. Accordingly, the array 14 includes four groups 70 of nozzle assemblies, one for each color. Each group 70 has its nozzle assemblies 10 arranged in two rows 72 and 74. One of the groups 70 is shown in greater detail in Figure 6.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the rows 72 and 74, the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 72. Also, the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 72 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 26 of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74 to pass between adjacent nozzles 22 of the assemblies 10 in the row 72. It is to be noted that each nozzle assembly 10 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 22 in the row 72 nest between the nozzles 22 and the actuators 28 of adjacent nozzle assemblies 10 in the row 74.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 22 in the rows 72 and 74, each nozzle 22 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br><br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, when the nozzles 22 are displaced towards the substrate 16, in use, due to the nozzle opening 24 being at a slight angle with respect to the nozzle chamber 34 ink is ejected slightly off the perpendicular. It is an advantage of the arrangement shown in Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings that the actuators 28 of the nozzle assemblies 10 in the rows 72 and 74 extend in the same direction to one side of the rows 72 and 74. Hence, the ink ejected from the nozzles 22 in the row 72 and the ink ejected from the nozzles 22 in the row 74 are offset with respect to each other by the same angle resulting in an improved print quality.<br>
Also, as shown in Figure 5 of the drawings, the substrate 16 has bond pads 76 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 56, to the actuators 28 of the nozzle assemblies 10. These electrical connections are fonned via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figures 5a and 5b. the nozzle array 14 shown in Figure 5 has been spaced to accommodate a containment formation 146 surrounding each nozzle assembly 10. The containment formation 146 includes a containment wall 144 surrounding the nozzle 22 and extending from the silicon substrate 16 to the underside of an apertured nozzle guard 80. If ink is not properly ejected because of nozzle damage, the leakage is confined so as not to affect the function of surrounding nozzles. Referring to specifically to 5b each containment formation 146 will have the ability to detect the presence of leaked ink. The detection electrodes are positioned in the containment formation 146 so that a build up of leaked or misdirected ink completes the circuit This triggers the nozzle fault circuit to stop further actuation of the nozzle array 14, Using a fault tolerance facility, the damaged nozzle 22 can be conpensated for by re-assigning the data to be printed to other nozzles in the array 14.<br>
The containment walls 144 necessarily occupy a proportion of the silicon substrate 16 which decreases the nozzle packbg density of the array. This in turn increases the production costs of the printhead chip. However where the manufacturing techniques result in a relatively high nozzle attrition rate, individual nozzle containment fonnations will avoid, or at least minimize any adverse effects to the print quality.<br>
It will be appreciated by those in the art, that the containment formation could also be configured to isolate groups of nozzles. Isolating groups of nozzles provides a better nozzle packing density but compensating for damaged nozzles using the surrounding nozzle groups is more difficult<br>
Referring to Figure 7, a nozzle array and a nozzle guard without containment walls is shown. With reference to the previous drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.<br><br>
A nozzle guard 80 is mounted on the silicon substrate 16 of the array 14. The nozzle guard 50 includes a shield 82 having a plurality of apertures 84 defined therethrough. The apertures 84 are in registration with the nozzle openings 24 of the nozzle assemblies 10 of the array 14 such that, when ink is ejected from any one of the nozzle openings 24, the ink passes through the associated passage before striking the print media.<br>
The guard 80 is silicon so that it has the necessary strength and rigidity to protect the nozzle array 14 from damaging contact with paper, dust or the users' fingers. By forming the guard from silicon, its coefficient of thermal expansion substantially matches that of the nozzle array. This aims to prevent the apertures 84 in the shield 82 from falling out of register with the nozzle array 14 as the printhead heats up to its normal operating temperature. Silicon is also well suited to accurate micro-machining using MEMS techniques discussed in greater detail below in relation to the manufacture of the nozzle assemblies 10.<br>
The shield 82 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle assemblies 10 by limbs or struts 86. One of the struts 86 has air inlet openings 88 defined therein.<br>
In use, when the array 14 is in operation, air is charged through the inlet openings 88 to be forced through the apertures 84 together with ink traveling through the apertures 84.<br>
The ink is not entrained in the air as the air is charged through the apertures 84 at a different velocity from that of the ink droplets 64. For example, the ink droplets 64 arc ejected from the nozzles 22 at a velocity of approximately 3m/s. The air is charged through the apertures 84 at a velocity of approximately Im/s.<br>
The puipose of the air is to maintain the apertures 84 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle assemblies 10 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet (q)enings 88 in the nozzle guard 80 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.       Referring now Figures 8 to 10 of the drawings, a process for manufacturing the nozzle assemblies 10 is described.<br>
Starting with the silicon substrate or wafer 16, the dielectric layer 18 is deposited on a surface of the wafer 16. The dielectric layer 18 is in the form of appnairoately 1.5 microns of CVD oxide. Resist is spun on to the layer 18 and the layer 18 is exposed to mask 100 and is subsequently developed.<br>
After being developed, the layer 18 is plasma etched down to the silicon layer 16. The resist is then stripped and the layer 18 is cleaned. This step defines the inkled  aperture 42.<br>
In Figure 8b of the drawings, approximately 0.8 microns of alunium 102 is deposited on the layer 18. Resist is spun on and the aluminum 102 is exposed to mast 104 and developed. The aluminum 102 is plasma etched down to the oxide layer 18, the resist is stripped and the device is cleaned. This step provides the bond pads and interconnects to the Inkjet actuator 28. This<br><br>
interconnect is to an NMOS drive transistor and a power plane with connections made in the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Approximately 0.5 microns of PECVD nitride is deposited as the CMOS passivation layer 20. Resist is spun on and the layer 20 is exposed to mask 106 whereafter it is developed. After development, the nitride is plasma etched down to the aluminum layer 102 and the silicon layer 16 in the region of the inlet aperture 42. The resist is stripped and the device cleaned.<br>
A layer 108 of a sacrificial material is spun on to the layer 20. The layer 108 is 6 microns of photo-sensitive polyimidc or approximately 4 µm of high temperature resist The layer 108 is softbaked and is then exposed to mask 110 whereafter it is developed. The layer 108 is then hardbaked at 400®C for one hour where the layer 108 is comprised of polyimide or at greater than 300C where the layer 108 is high temperature resist. It is to be noted in the drawings that the pattern-dependent distortion of the polyimide layer 108 caused by shrinkage is taken into account in the design of the mask 110.<br>
In the next step, shown in Figure 8e of the drawings, a second sacrificial layer 112 is applied. The layer 112 is either 2 µm of photo-sensitive polyimide which is spun on or approximately 1.3 fxm of high temperature resist The layer 112 is softbaked and exposed to mask 114. After exposure to the mask 114, the layer 112 is developed. In the case of the layer 112 being polyimide, the layer 112 is hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour. Where the layer 112 is resist, it is hardbaked at greater than 300°C for approximately one hour.<br>
A 0.2 micron multi-layer metal layer 116 is then deposited. Part of this layer 116 forms the passive beam 60 of the actuator 28.<br>
The layer 116 is formed by sputtering 1,000A of titanium nitride (TiN) at around 300°C followed by sputtering 50A of tantalum nitride (TaN). A further 1,000A of TiN is sputtered on followed by 50A of TaN and a further 1,000A of TiN. Other materials which can be used instead of TiN are TiBz. MoSiz or (Ti» AI)N.<br>
The layer 116 is then exposed to mask 118, developed and plasma etched down to the layer 112 whereafter resist, applied for the layer 116, is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 108 or 112.<br>
A third sacrificial layer 120 is applied by spinning on 4 jxm of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6 m high temperature resist. The layer 120 is softbaked whereafter it is exposed to mask 122. The exposed layer is then developed followed by hard baldng. In the case of polyinudc, the layer 120 is hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour or at greater than 300°C where the layer 120 comprises resist<br><br>
A second multi-layer metal layer 124 is applied to the layer 120. The constituents of the layer 124 are the same as the layer 116 and are applied in the same manner. It will be appreciated that both layers 116 and 124 are electrically conductive layers.<br>
The layer 124 is exposed to mask 126 and is then developed. The layer 124 is plasma etched down to the polyimide or resist layer 120 whereafter resist applied for the layer 124 is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 108,112 or 120. It will be noted that the remaining part of the layer 124 defines the active beam 58 of the actuator 28.<br>
A fourth sacrificial layer 128 is applied by spinning on 4 µm of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6µm of high temperature resist The layer 128 is softbaked, exposed to the mask 130 and is then developed to leave the island portions as shown in Figure 9k of the drawings. The remaining portions of the layer 128 are hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour in the case of polyimide or at greater than 300°C for resist<br>
As shown in Figure 81 of the drawing a high Young's modulus dielectric layer 132 is deposited. The layer 132 is constituted by approximately m of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide. The layer 132 is deposited at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 108,112,120,128, The primary characteristics required for this dielectric layer 132 are a high elastic modulus, chemical joertness and good adhesion to TiN.<br>
A fifth sacrificial layer 134 is applied by spinning on 2µm of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 1.3)xm of high temperature resist The layer 134 is softbaked, exposed to mask 136 and developed. The remaining portion of die layer 134 is then hardbaked at 400C for one hour in the case of the polyimide or at greater than 300°C for the resist<br>
The dielectric layer 132 is plasma etched down to the sacrificial layer 128 taking care not to remove any of the sacrificial layer 134.<br>
This step defines the nozzle opening 24, the lever arm 26 and the anchor S4 of the nozzle assembly 10.<br>
A high Young's modulus dielectric layer 138 is deposited. This layer 138 is formed by depositing 0.2µm of silicon nitride or aluminum nitride at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 108,112,120 and 128.<br>
Then, as shown in Figure 8p of the drawings, the layer 138 is anisotropically plasma etched to a depth of 0.35 microns. This etch is intended to clear the dielectric from the entire surface except the side walls of the dielectric layer 132 and the sacrificial layer 134. This step creates the nozzle rim 36 around the nozzle opening 24 which "pins" the meniscus of ink, as described above.<br>
An ultraviolet (UV) release tape 140 is applied. 4nm of resist is spun on to a rear of the silicon wafer 16. The wafer 16 is exposed to mask 142 to back etch the wafer 16 to define the ink inlet channel 48. The resist is then stripped from the wafer 16.<br><br>
A further UV release tape (not shown) is applied to a rear of the wafer 16 and the tape 140 is removed. The sacrificial layers 108,112,120,128 and 134 are stripped in oxygen plasma to provide the final nozzle assembly 10 as shown in Figures 8r and 9r of the drawings. For ease of reference, the reference numerals illustrated in these two drawings are the same as those in Figure i of the drawings to indicate the relevant parts of the nozzle assembly 10. Figures 11 and 12 show the operation of the nozzle assembly 10, manufactured in accordance with the process described above with reference to Figures 8 and 9 and these figures correspond to Figures 2 to 4 of the drawings.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.<br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS:<br>
L      A printhead for an ink jet printer, the printhead including:<br>
a substrate carrying an array of nozzles for ejecting ink onto media to be printed;<br>
an apertured guard positioned over at least one of the nozzles such that ejected ink passes through an aperture and onto the media;<br>
the guard and the nozzle at least partially defining a containment formation for isolating leaked or misdirected ink from the nozzle from at least some of the other nozzles in the array; and<br>
means to detect a predetermined amount of ink in the containment formation and stop further supply of ink to the nozzle.<br>
2.	A printhead according to Claim 1 wherein each noszle in the array has a respective containment formation to isolate it from all the other nozzles in the anay and each of the containment formations has one of said detection means.<br>
3.	A printhead according to Claim 1 wherein the containment formations isolate predetermined groups of nozzles from the other nozzles in the array; wherein<br>
the detection means associated with each of the containment formations is configured to stop further supply of ink to the predetermined group upon sensing a predetenruned level of ink in the containment formation.<br>
4.	A printhead according to Gaim 1 wherein each of the nozzles use a bend actuator attached to a paddle for ejecting ink wherein the detection means disables the bend actuator to stop further supply of ink to the nozzle.<br>
5.	A printhead according to Gaim 4 wherein the detection means has a pair of electrical contacts positioned in the containment formation such that an accumulation of the predetermined amount of ink closes an electrical circuit such that a comparator disables the actuator.<br>
6.	A printhead according to Claim 1 wherein the containment formation further includes containment walls extending from the guard to the exterior of each of the nozzles.<br>
7.	A printhead according to Claim 5 wherein the nozzle guard is formed from silicon.<br>
8.	A printhead according to Claim 1 wherein the detection means provides feedback for a fault tolerance facility to adjust the operation of other nozzles in the array to compensate for the damaged nozzle.<br>
9.	A printhead according to Gaim 5 wherein the nozzle guard further includes fluid inlet openings for directing fluid through the passages, to inhibit the build up of foreign particles on the nozzle array.<br>
10.	A printhead according to Claim 9 the fluid inlet openings are positioned remote from a bond pad of the nozzle array.<br><br>
10. A printhead for an Inkjet printer substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
