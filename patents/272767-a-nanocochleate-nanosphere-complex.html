TITLE<br>
" A NANOCOCHLEATE-NANOSPHERE COMPLEX "<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Dept. of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Powai, Mumbai-400076, Maharashtra, India; Indian<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is directed towards development of nano-complexes comprising nanococleates linked with nanospheres for delivery of two or more drugs. The nanospheres are either chemically or physically bound to the nanocochleates by a simplified procedure which avoids the use of synthetic polymers. Thus, another object of the invention relates to a process for preparing nanocochleate-nanosphere complexes using nanospheres of biodegradable biopolymers and proteins rather than cationic molecules for delivery of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Many diseases require therapy with two or more drugs, combinations of the drugs in such a manner as to allow sustained release and reduce the frequency of doses is desirable. One such condition where this would be particularly useful is in cancers. Cancer is the second most common cause of death among adults in most countries. Great progress has been made in the treatment of selected malignancies and approximately 50% of all malignancies can be treated using current treatment strategies. Still, majority of these treatments are carried out by surgery. However, surgical excision is not effective when the cancer cells have infiltrated the nearby vital organs or have spread to other parts of the body. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy used alone or in combination have also shown to greatly improve the management of patients with a variety of solid and haematologic malignancies. Chemotherapeutic drugs may destroy healthy tissue along with the cancer cells and also give rise to adverse side effects such as fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, gastro-intestinal disturbances, anemia etc. Further, by oral delivery of the chemotherapeutic agents about 8-10 of the active drug is either denatured by the stomach environment or eliminated via liver metabolism. Thus, despite improvements in the treatment of most metastatic solid tumors, these remain largely incurable. Reasons for this are insufficient tumor selectivity of anti-cancer agents and poor penetration within the tumor mass.<br>
 <br>
To overcome the failure of conventional therapy, combination of two different cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents is given. This combination therapy improves cancer remission rate and duration of survival. At present, combination therapy is achieved by two or more drugs being administered separately which does not allow one to achieve controlled and sustained release from the formulations. In addition, there is a need to co-encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs in the same carrier through non-invasive routes like oral or aerosol.<br>
In this domain, particularly for dual delivery of drugs, nanotechnology based therapeutics have given rise to enormous potential in addressing the failures of traditional therapeutics that could not be effectively formulated owing to poor water solubility or lack of target specificity. Nanoparticles are preferred for their properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, conjugation, encapsulation and their ability to be functionalized. Further, these nanoparticles are superior over conventional drug delivery methods as these can be targeted to a specific area and owing to their extremely small size they can penetrate through smaller capillaries and are easily taken up by cancer cells.<br>
US 7,304,045 B2 describes a dual particle tumor targeting system consisting of a galactosamine conjugated nanoparticle and a second EPR mediated nanoparticle mixed together in a solution. Also, the two nanoparticles are simply administered at different time points as there is no single composite entity formed by the interaction of the nanoparticles There is no covalent interaction between the two nanostructures, thereby making the targeting of the second nanoparticle passive. On the other hand, the present invention does not require administration of the two particles at different time points as the constituent nanospheres and nanocochleates are engineered to release the drugs at different time points.<br>
Patent No. US 7,244,781 B2 describes the method of preparation of composite compositions including polymeric nanoparticles and clay nanoparticles. The nanoparticles, being non biodegradable and non-biocompatible, would be cleared by the reticulo-endothelial system and elicit immune response by the body.<br>
 <br>
US 2010/0203163 describes an injectable polymer-lipid blend provided as a localized drug delivery system for a pharmaceutically active agent. The effectiveness of the system is dependent upon the rheological properties and the viscoelasticity of the blend. Also, it is distinct from the dual-delivery system developed by virtue of being a matrix based system.<br>
US 7511023 and US 2004/0138152 describes the method of preparation of anticancer drug-chitosan complex forming self aggregates in aqueous media composed of a hydrophobic anticancer agent and a hydrophilic chitosan. The present invention deals with alginate-chitosan nanoparticles complexed with lipid nanocochleates for dual drug delivery.<br>
US 7,740,883 and US 2005/0226938 describe methods for preparing cross linked core and core-shell nanoparticle polymers from chitosan. The dual delivery system developed by us comprises of chitosan nanoparticles specifically modified with alginic acid to increase the encapsulation of hydrophilic anthracycline drugs.<br>
US 2009/0036417 and US 2004/0092727 describe cochleate and nanocochleate systems wherein the agents bridging agents are organic multi-valent cations. In the dual-delivery system developed by us, nanoparticles are used as bridging agents for formation of cochleates.<br>
US 20030185894 describes a process for producing nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug paclitaxel and albumin. In the dual delivery nanocomplex system developed by us, albumin nanoparticles are used to encapsulate the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin.<br>
US20060246524 and US20090181398 describe conjugate compositions that include a specific-binding moiety covalently coupled to a nanoparticle through a heterobifunctional polyalkyleneglycol linker. In the dual nano-complex system developed by us, two distinct species of nanoparticles are physically or chemically bound together without the use of any linker molecule.<br>
 <br>
US 2009/0053297 describes negatively charged and PEGylated lipid structures (liposomes, cochleates, micelles) for reducing the immunogenicity and increasing the half life of therapeutic proteins such as Factor VIII. The system uses a single lipid structure to encapsulate therapeutic proteins. It does not deal with nanosphere-nanocochleate complexes for combination drug delivery.<br>
US Patents 4078052 and 5840707 deal with the development of cochleates from large unilamellar vesicles and for the delivery of proteins or peptides as vaccines. These patents do not deal with control of sizes in the form of nanocochleates and do not deal with nanocomplexes for dual drug delivery.<br>
US Patent 6153217 deals with a process for the preparation of nanocochleates for oral or mucosal drug delivery. It comprises of preparing small unilamellar liposomes of negatively charged lipid mainly phosphatidylserine and mixing the liposome suspension with synthetic polymer A consisting of dextran or polyethyleneglycol 2-20%w/w. The liposome/polymer suspension is then added into a solution of polymer B (wherein polymers A and B are immiscible) like polyvinylpyrolidone or polyvinylalcohol or Ficoll or polyvinylmethylether or polyethylene glycol 2-20%w/w. Finally a solution of a positively charged molecule which is a cationic salt is added to the two phase polymer system and excess polymer is removed by centrifugation.<br>
Despite the aforesaid, there is still a need for a unique nano-complex system comprising two different nanoparticle systems with better physiochemical properties, anti-tumor activity and targeting ability. Furthermore, the present invention deals with nanosphere-nanocochleate complexes in which the nanocochleates are held together by biopolymeric or protein nanospheres instead of adding cations or drugs (as used in prior art) to facilitate the acquisition of their characteristic multilayered spiral structure.<br>
Thus, the present invention deals with the development of nanocochleate-nanosphere complexes with a new process where biopolymeric and protein nanospheres are formed and directly added during the hydration of the unilamellar liposomes to form nanocochleate-<br>
 <br>
nanosphere complexes for dual drug delivery (both hydrophobic and hydrophilic in nature). The invention employs alginate-chitosan and albumin nanospheres for causing precipitation of the nano-cochleate-nanosphere complexes for dual drug delivery.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to develop biodegradable lipopolymeric and lipoprotein nanocochleate-nanosphere complexes for delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.<br>
Another object is to provide sustained release, gastric resistance and synergistic action of the dual drugs encapsulated within the nanocomplexes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide active targeting and endocytosis of the nanocochleate-nanosphere complex.<br>
A further object of this invention is in process for preparing nanocohleate-nanosphere complexes using nanospheres of biodegradable biopolymers and proteins rather than cationic molecules, for delivery hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The present invention has the following advantages over the prior art:<br>
Biodegradable   biopolymeric   and  protein   nanospheres   stably   linked   with   lipid nanocochleates<br>
-	simple process for preparation which avoids cationic salts for crosslinking<br>

In describing and claiming the invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described herein. As used herein, each of the following terms has the meaning associated with it in this section. Specific and preferred values listed below for individual components, substituents,<br>
 <br>
and ranges are for illustration only; they do not exclude other defined values or other values within defined ranges for the components and substituents.<br>
As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
Thus, before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particularly exemplified systems or process parameters that may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
In our present invention we have encapsulated two different drugs for combination chemotherapy in two different nanoparticle systems which are combined together to forma unique nano-complex system with better physiochemical properties, anti-tumour activity and targeting ability than either of the constituents. In these regard spherical nanoparticles were prepared from biopolymers and their derivatives (such as chitosan, alginate, albumin) encapsulating drug 1(D1). These nanoparticles were used as complexing agent for the preparation of nanocochleates made up of lipids such as Phosphatidylserine (DOPS), Phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and Cholesterol.<br>
The invention deals with nanosphere-nanocochleate complexes in which the nanocochleates are held together by biopolymeric or protein nanospheres instead of adding cations or drugs (as used in prior art) to facilitate the acquisition of their characteristic multilayered spiral structure. The anticancer drug 1 (Dl) entrapped (or adsorbed on surface) within spherical nanoparticles helps in the formation of nanocochleate like structure while the drug (D2) is encapsulated within the bilayer of the nanocochleates. Two distinct species of nano-complexes were obtained by this method depending upon the size of the spherical nanoparticles: (i) Nanosphere in nanocochleate: Spherical nanoparticles entrapped inside spiral nanocochleates for (ii) Nanosphere on Nanocohleate: Spherical nanoparticles covalently attached on the surface of the spiral nanocochleates.<br>
 <br>
In context of the present invention, nanocochleates are cylindrical (cigar-like) microstructures that consist of a series of lipid bilayers which are formed as a result of the condensation of small unilamellar negatively charged liposomes. They have a unique multilayered structure consisting of a solid, lipid bilayer sheet rolled up in a spiral or in stacked sheets, with little or no internal aqueous space. Because the entire nanocochleate structure is a series of solid layers, components encapsulate within the interior of the nanocohleate structure and remain intact, even though the outer layers of the nanocochleate may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions. The drug is preferably encapsulated in the lipid bilayer of the nanocochleates.<br>
The different lipids that make up the nanocochleates include but are not limited to phosphotidyl serine [PS], dioleoylphosphatidyl serine [DOPS], phosphatidic acid [PA], phosphatidylinositol [PI], phosphatidyl glycerol [PG], phosphatidylcholine [PC], phosphatidylethanolamine [PE], diphosphoticlylglycerol [DPG], dioleoyl phosphatidic acid [DOPA], distearoyl phosphatidyl serine [DSPS], dimyristoyl phosphatidyl serine [DMPS], dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol [DPPG] or cholesterol. Nanocochleates of the present invention, without intending to be limited therein are preferably made of the lipid dioleyl phosphatidylserine [DOPS].<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lipid Dioleyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS) was employed as major component for formation of the structure. DOPS is an anionic phospholipid which tends to provide negative charge so as to facilitate the assembly of the spiral multilayered structure. In addition, DOPS is a completely biocompatible and biodegradable lipid. It is, in fact, of nutritious value and has benefits in memory and learning enhancement. In addition to it cholesterol and DPPC (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine) were added to improve the stability of the structure during storage as well as when administered for activity.<br>
The particle size of the nanocochleates are preferably in the range of 300 - 500 nm.<br>
In accordance to the instant invention, nanospheres are solid-state nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 200 nm in size. These are mainly spherical particles which can be either<br>
 <br>
amorphous or crystalline in nature and have the ability to protect the drug from enzymatic and chemical degradation. The drug is dissolved or encapsulated or attached to the nanoparticles and, depending on the methods employed for its preparation; one can obtain nanospheres, nanocapsules or aquasomes. Nanospheres are generally composed of natural polymers such as chitosan, gum, albumin, gelatin or collagen and the drug is uniformly dispersed in it. The tiny capsule of drug store house is called vesicle and the solid skeleton structure is called nanosphere. The nanospheres of the present invention are biodegradable in nature.<br>
The particle size of the nanospheres are preferably in the range of 40 - 100 nm.<br>
Nano-complexes meant for dual delivery of pharmaceutically active entities in accordance to the present invention comprises nanospheres linked with nanocochleates wherein the nanosphere is either entrapped inside the nanocochleate or covalently attached on the surface of the nanocochleate. Thus, nano-complexes meant for dual delivery of pharmaceutically active entities consisting of lipid nanocochleates (particle size 300-500 nm) either incorporating or covalently attaching comparatively smaller spherical nanoparticles on their surfaces (particle size 40-100 nm). The active entities are encapsulated into the nanocochleates and the nanospheres, thereby ensuring simultaneous delivery of both the pharmaceuticals for combination chemotherapy. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel were the drugs used as the representative hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs encapsulated within the nano-complexes. This formulation prepared intended for different routes of administration from oral to aerosol. Therefore, the present developed formulation comprising two different anticancer drugs tend to show good anticancer activity than when it is administered separately in multidrug resistant cells.<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to a nano-complex comprising nanospheres with a first drug entrapped within said nanospheres and lipid based nanocochleates with a second drug encapsulated therein, characterized in that, said nanospheres are chemically or physically linked either within or on the surface of the nanocochleate such that a combination of drugs are co-encapsulated in a single nanosphere-nanocochleate complex.<br>
 <br>
The present invention however contemplates the use of two or more drugs for encapsulation and delivery.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is a nano-complex delivery vehicle comprising of a nanocochleate formulation associated with smaller spherical nanoparticles, which in turn, also serve as complexing agent for nanocochleate formation. These nanostructures comprise of two different anti-cancer drugs for effective treatment of the cancer by combination chemotherapy. The spherical nanoparticles (made up of biopolymers such as alginate, chitosan, albumin) contain the hydrophilic anticancer drug and the other hydrophobic anticancer drug is encapsulated in the lipid bilayer of the nanocochleates. Thus two different anticancer drugs are co-encapsulated in one single nano-complex thereby facilitating synergistic anticancer activity.<br>
The present invention although explains the use of nano-complexes for dual delivery of drugs for combination chemotherapy but the scope is not restricted to anticancer agents per se. The drug may be an anti-cancer agent, anti-viral agent , an anesthetic, anti-infectious, steroidal anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, tranquiliser, nutritional supplement, vasodilatory agent and the like. These nanostructures also help various other pharmaceutically active entities to cross cell barriers, permit solubilization and protects compounds during transport owing to their unique physiochemical properties.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided to better illustrate the claimed invention and are not to be interpreted in any way as limiting the scope of the invention. All specific compositions, materials, and methods described below, in whole or in part, fall within the scope of the invention. These specific compositions, materials, and methods are not intended to limit the invention, but merely to illustrate specific embodiments falling within the scope of the invention. One skilled in the art may develop equivalent compositions, materials, and methods without the exercise of inventive capacity and without departing from the scope of the invention. It will be understood that many variations can be made in<br>
 <br>
the procedures herein described while still remaining within the bounds of the invention. It is the intention of the inventors that such variations are included within the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1: PREPARATION OF NANOSPHERE IN NANOCOCHLEATE COMPLEXES USING ALGINATE CHITOSAN NANOSPHERES PREPARATION OF ALGINATE CHITOSAN NANOSPHERES (CALG-1)<br>
Alginate chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using controlled gelification of alginate in presence of cation and chitosan. Briefly, calcium chloride (0.5 ml, 18mM) was added to 9.5 ml of sodium alginate solution (0.06% w/v) containing drug. 2 ml of chitosan solution (0.05% w/v) was added followed by stirring for 30 min and the mixture was kept overnight at room temperature. Drug loaded nanoparticles were recovered by centrifugation at 32000 rpm for 30-45 min and washed thrice with TES buffer to obtain the final pellet. The supernatant solution was used to determine the concentration of unentrapped drug (doxorubicin (Dl)'by using fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelength of 470nm and 580 nm.<br>
PREPARATION OF NANOCOCHLEATES ENCAPSULATING ALGINATE-CHITOSAN NANOSPHERES (NANOSPHERE-IN NANOCOHLEATE) (CAL-DP 1)<br>
Dioleyl Phosphatidylserine (DOPS) and cholesterol in the ratio of 9:1 were dissolved in chloroform-methanol (2:1). Thin film of lipids was formed using rotary evaporator at 40°C under vacuum. For drug-D2 (paclitaxel) encapsulation, drug dissolved in methanol and added along with lipids during film formation step. Then film was hydrated with nanoparticles in TES-Buffer to get lipid concentration of 10mg lipid/ml at 45°C for 20 min and sonicated for a minute using probe sonicator. Thus encochleated nanoparticles centrifuged at 25,000g for 10 min to separate un-encapsulated nanoparticles. The pellet reconstituted accordingly with TES Buffer containing 0.5mM of calcium chloride.<br>

2.2.	PREPARATION OF NANOCOCHLEATES WITH COVALENTLY ATTACHED ALGINATE-CHITOSAN<br>
NANOPARTICLES (CAL-DP2)<br>
For the preparation of the dual delivery nano-complex, a cochleate suspension comprising the lipids DOPS and DPPC (in the ratio 4:1) and encapsulating drug D2 (paclitaxel) was prepared by the method stated above in example 1(b). The aliquot of the alginic acid modified chitosan nanoparticle solution was added during the film hydration step. 100mg l-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide EDC and 50mg N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were also added to the cochleate/chitosan-alginate mixture to facilitate covalent bonding between the surface functional groups of nanocochleates and alginate-chitosan nanoparticles. The carbodiimide was solubilized using a vortex mixture. The mixture was reacted for 2h at room temperature (6) and was centrifuged. The supernatant of the centrifuged solution was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of TES buffer. The resultant suspension was then sonicated and then lyophilized.<br>

3.1. PREPARATION OF ALBUMIN NANOPARTICLES (ALB)<br>
For the preparation of albumin nanoparticles, aliquots of 4.0 mg of doxorubicin and 20 mg of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) were dissolved in 1ml of purified water and stirred for 2 h. 3ml of ethanol was added drop wise to facilitate the self assembly of albumin nanoparticles. Further it was crosslinked using aqueous 8% glutaraldehyde solution (0.294-1.175µl/mg BSA, 24 h). The pH was adjusted to 8.2 after carrying out the desolvation step at pH 6.5. Further particles were purified by centrifugation at 25000g for 20 minutes, and then dispersed in water and lyophilized. The supernatant solution was used to determine the concentration of un-entrapped doxorubicin (Dl) by using fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelength of 480nm and 550 nm.<br>
 <br>
3.2. PREPARATION OF NANOCOCHLEATES WITH COVALENTLY ATTACHED ALBUMIN NANOPARTICLES (CALB-DP)<br>
For the preparation of the dual delivery nano-complex, a cochleate suspension comprising the lipids DOPS and DPPC (in the ratio 4:1) and encapsulating drug D2 (paclitaxel) was prepared by the method stated above in example 1(b). The aliquot of the albumin nanoparticle solution was added during the film hydration step. 100mg EDC and 50mg N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) were also added to the cochleate/albumin mixture to facilitate covalent bonding between the surface functional groups of nanocochleates and albumin nanoparticles. The carbodiimide was solubilized using a vortex mixture. The mixture was reacted for 2h at room temperature and was centrifuged. The supernatant of the centrifuged solution was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of TES buffer. The resultant suspension was then sonicated. The resultant suspension was lyophilized and FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Nanosphere-nanocochleate systems as described in example 1 wherein the method of alginate-chitosan nanosphere formation is slightly modified: About 1% chitosan solution was prepared in 1% acetic acid. 1% TPP solution was prepared in water and an equivalent amount of alginic acid was added to it and the mixture was incubated overnight in the dark. Nanoparticles were spontaneously obtained under constant stirring at room temperature for 1 hour at 1000 rpm. The prepared nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 25000g for 20 minutes, and then dispersed in water and lyophilized, followed by steps for incorporation in nanocochleates as described in example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 5:<br>
5.1. CHARACTERISATION OF NANOSPHERE NANOCOCHLEATE<br>
COMPLEXES<br>
The typical structure of the nanoparticles and nanocochleates was confirmed by using electron microscopy  (Transmission and scanning electron microscopy).  Particle size<br>
 <br>
measured using dynamic light scattering (Table 1) were in coherence with particles size as observed in electron microscopy studies (Figure 2, Figure 1, Figure 1). The Zeta potential of the different formulations is stated in Table 1.<br>

Further to confirm the nanoparticle in cochleate. confocal microscopy of the same was carried out with two different dyes (cresol red and calcein). Rhodamine 6G (lmg/ml) was dissolved in ethanol and added along with lipids during thin film formation. On the other hand Calcein loaded nanoparticles were prepared separately and nanocochleates were prepared out of them as explained in example 1,2,3.The confocal microscopy images confirmed the formation of needle shaped cochleate like structure (Figure 4) with two different dyes.<br>
 <br>
5.2. ENCAPSULATION AND IN VITRO RELEASE OF DRUGS FROM NANOSPHERE-NANOCOCHLEATECOMPLEXES<br>
The invented formulation showed high encapsulation of paclitaxel (Table 2). Similarly, high entrapment of hydrophilic drug such as doxorubicin was observed (Table 2).<br>
TABLE 2: ENCAPSULATION EFFICIENCY OF DRUGS<br>
<br>
	Encapsulation efficiency (%)<br>
Drug	Paclitaxel	Doxorubicin<br>
CAL-DP-1	81.9±7.7	66.2 ±2.2<br>
CAL-DP-2	76.8 ±4.3	73.8 ±0.3<br>
CALB-DP	79.3 ±6.1	89.2 ± 0.4<br>
In vitro release was performed for two different drugs using dialysis bag method in 25% methanolic phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Methanol was incorporated in the media in order to overcome the solubility issue of the drug.<br>
5.2.1. CAL-DP1: Approximately 30% paclitaxel was released from cochleates into release media over 48 h of dialysis where as standard PTX released 85% with in 3h shows sustained and controlled release of drug from the cochleates (Figure 8). Similarly, doxorubicin as estimated by fluorescence spectrometer (R2 = 0.989) was found to be released 76% of the total drug in 24h in comparison to the free standard doxorubicin released similar quantity in6 0 min explains the controlling release nature of the two drugs from the formulation (Figure 8). To test the cochleate formulation for oral delivery we tried to identify the gastric resistance of the same in 25% methanolic 0.1M hydrochloric acid (pH 1.2) by in vitro release using dialysis bag method for an hour. Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin released only 10% and 37% from the cochleate respectively and found to exhibit gastric resistance (Figure 11). Thus this formulation can also be administered via oral route.<br>
 <br>
5.2.2.	CAL-DP2: The percentage of Paclitaxel released from cochleates was about 22% in<br>
26 hours (Figure 9). Doxorubicin as estimated by fluorescence spectrometer (R2 = 0.989)<br>
was found to be released 60% in 26h (Figure 9). There was a marked<br>
improvement in the control of release of Doxorubicin from chitosan alginate nanoparticles covalently attached to nanocochleates as compared to the free standard doxorubicin. This formulation can also be administered via oral route owing to its controlled release and gastric resistance as shown by the reduction in release of both paclitaxel and doxorubicin at acidic pH (Figure 11).<br>
5.2.3.	CALB-DP: The percentage of Paclitaxel released from cochleates was about 19% in<br>
72 hours (Figure 10). Doxorubicin as estimated by fluorescence spectrometer (R2 = 0.989)<br>
was found to be released 60% in 72h (Figure 10). There was a marked improvement in the<br>
control of release of Doxorubicin from albumin nanoparticles covalently attached to<br>
nanocochleates as compared to the free standard doxorubicin. This formulation can be<br>
considered for intravenous delivery. Oral administration is also possible owing to the<br>
presence of specific uptake pathways for albumin, a natural nutrient for the body<br>
EXAMPLE 6: SYNERGISTIC ACTION OF DUAL DRUGS LOADED WITHIN NANOSPHERE_NANOCOHLEATE COMPLEXES<br>
In vitro anti-cancer activity - The formulations were tested for cytotoxicity in the following cell lines:<br>
CAL-DP 1: HeLa (drug sensitive cell line), HCT-15(multi drug resistant cancer cell line) CAL-DP 2 and CALB-DP: MDA-MB 231 (multidrug resistant cell line) The IC-50 values are shown in the Table 3. As compared to PTX or DOX alone, the combination index calculated as explained by chou et al showed synergistic activity. Thus two drug combination within the cochleate showed synergistic effect in killing the multi¬drug resistant cancer cell line.<br>

EXAMPLE 7: ACTIVE ENDOCYTOSIS OF NANOSPHERENANOCOHLEATE COMPLEXES<br>
In vitro cellular uptake study - To study the efficiency of the cellular internalization of the dual delivery nano-complexes the following dye encapsulation schematics were used: CALG-DP   1:   Calcein   in   alginate   chitosan   nanoparticles   and   Rhodamine   6G   in nanocochleates<br>
 <br>
CALG-DP 2: Rhodamine 6G in alginate-chitosan nanoparticles and Curcumin in nanocochleates<br>
CALB- DP: Rhodamine 6G in albumin nanoparticles and Curcumin in nanocochleates All formulations were tested in confluent cancer cells. Briefly, cells were collected from the culture flask and seeded into 24 well plate containing glass coverslip at the density of 5 x 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. On the next day old media new media containing cochleates (calcein in nanoparticles + rhodamine 6G in lipid bilayer), free calcein (l2mM) into the well and further incubated for 3 h after washing and fixation coverslips were observed under Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). As shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 both the encapsulated dyes were found internalized within the cancer cell line efficiently. Further, Z scanning of the cell image clearly indicates that the nano-complexes get access to cytoplasm and are not constrained to surface of the cell. This study implies that present invention helps in mediating and facilitating the cellular uptake and delivery of the encapsulated materials.<br>
