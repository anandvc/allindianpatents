				<td>The invention relates to an electric drive for a motor vehicle, in particular for a multi track electromobile.<br>
Such types of electric drives are being used more and more in twin-track motor vehicles, in both road and commercial vehicles. The usual design uses mainly two independent electric motors, which are geared down by a spur gear or planet gear so that the motors can run at a much higher speed than the drive gears. In this way the structural volume and the weight of the driving unit can be reduced. A considerable disadvantage however is the great expense of the individual parts.<br>
Thus DE 26 06 807 B describes an electric motor with two side output, in the stators of which two mechanically and electrically independent rotors are excited jointly by the stator, whereby the rotors are positioned so that no end shield is necessary for the rotor bearing opposite the respective output side.<br>
In DE 42 36 093 A a drive system for an electric vehicle is described, which comprises several motors and reducing gears with planet gear devices, which are connected in a force transmitting way between the motors and the gears of the electric vehicle, whereby the improvement is that the motors and gears are arranged coaxially so that they can be arranged coaxtally between the right and left wheel of the electric vehicle. Here all of the described driving components are arranged in a housing By means of a suitable choice of force transmission by means of the gear devices the torque distribution to the wheel axes can be influenced advantageously.<br>
Likewise DE 44 21 425 C describes the drive of a road vehicle with an electrical drive unit in which two separately functioning units each with an electric motor and a geat arranged facing the respective drive gear, designed as a spur gear with an output shaft arranged eccentric to the axis of rotation of the electric motor or as a planet gear, act on the drive wheels of a vehicle axis Electric motors, gears and output shaft bearing are thus mounted on a common support member.<br>
The disadvantage of the above described conventional drive units is the use of two mechanically and electrically independent electric motors, whereby for each drive<br><br>
wheel more or less the same expense is required, as a gear is also assigned to each drive wheel.<br>
The objective of the invention is to create an electric drive for a motor vehicle, which on the one hand avoids the disadvantages of the aforementioned drives and on the other hand is easy to assemble and meets the requirement of independent rotational speeds for the left and right drive gear of an axis.<br>
The electric drive according to the invention is characterised in that a fixed housing i.s provided for the vehicle construction or for the vehicle frame, whereby in this housing a motor frame with a stator and a rotor provided in the motor frame are rotatably mounted respectively, and the motor frame and the rotor for work output rotate in opposite directions, whereby one drive line is connected with the rotor or with the motor frame and the rotational movement of the rotor or the motor frame is connected by a transmission device with the drive and output rotating in the same direction and a second drive line is connected with the motor frame or with the rotor, and the rotational movement of the motor frame is connected with the rotor and the rotational movement of the motor frame or the rotor is transmitted by a transmission device with a drive and output rotating in opposite directions. With the invention it is possible for the first time to create a drive, which is arranged between the left and the right drive wheel, which fulfils the differential function and takes up so little space that a rigid. coaxial connection between the gear axes and the drive is possible without reducing the ground clearance of the vehicle to an impermissible extent. The invention is based on the fact that in every drive engine, which provides its mechanical power by means of a rotational movement, the torque on the output shaft is equal to the torque at winch the engine has to be supported relative to its environment. In the conventional design with a fixed engine thus the driving power is provided exclusively by the moving output shaft. The invention however aims to achieve a branching out of output to two drive lines in order to accommodate the conditions of the vehicle drive. This can be matiaged according to the invention in that on the one hand the output shaft performs a rotational movement, for example the rotor, via the first drive line, on the other hand the motor frame also performs a rotational movement in an opposite direction to the rotational direction of the output shaft via the second drive line, A work output of both drive lines is achieved if the rotational movement is in the same direction as the<br><br>
occurring torque, which is necessarily the case in the arrangement according to the invention. By means of electromagnetic generation of torque, which on the one hand is picked up as an action torque on the output shaft and on the other hand exists as a reaction torque on the motor frame, there is no mechanical connection between these two parts of the arrangement, which prevents the free rotatability of both parts In a drive for a road vehicle it is thus necessary, that the work output of the drive gears s is performed with the same directional rotational movement of the right and left gear This is achieved by the drive according to the invention.<br>
In an embodiment variant according to claim 2 the motor frame is mounted in the housing. It is an advantage that a simple construction is possible, which ensures economical production. The motor frame can be mounted on both sides in the housing in such a way that the shaft end of the motor frame extends into the transmission device of the second drive line. By means of the possible short support length between the bearings high motor speeds are possible without mechanical resonances occurring<br>
A further embodiment variant according to claim 3 is also advantageous, as thereby  a compact construction is possible.<br>
A development according to claim 4 is also advantageous, as thereby it is also ensured that both the output shaft via the rotor, and the motor frame can perform any rotational movement. As in the drive according to the invention the output is branched preferably to both sides of the electric motor corresponding bearings are provided It is also advantageous that on the bearing no high centrifugal forces occur and relatively small bearing diameters are used.<br>
According to claim 5 the rotor is mounted on the one hand in the housing of the dri ve and on the other hand in the rotating motor frme, in such a way that the shaft end of the rotor extends into the transmission device of the fu'st drive line. In this way advantageous short paths for the torque transmission are provided.<br>
According to a special design according to claim 6 the drive hne drives gear shafts via the transmission device. In this way h is possible advantageously to equip motor<br><br>
vehicles with the drive according to the invention. Thus it is possible to produce smaller and medium sized vehicles, in particular communal vehicles, economically<br>
The additional special design according to claim 7 has the almost indispensable advantage for a motor vehicle that the differential function is fulfilled in the simplest manner.<br>
For the drive device according to the invention apart from the described transmission device also spur gear, bevel gear and worm gear transmission devices are suitable which on the one hand ensure the necessary speed translation to slow between the drive shaft and gear shafts and on the other hand can obtain a reversal in rotational direction inside the transmission device.<br>
The design according to claim 8 is advantageous as in one transmission step the necessary transmission between the drive and gear shafts can be achieved<br>
According to an advantageous development according to claim 9 with a fixed rotational diameter of the planet sets, the transmission ratio is formed exclusively from the diameter of the larger sun gear and the difference of the diameter of the two sun gears. The desired direction of rotation of the gear shafts is obtained however with a given transmission ratio by the arrangement of the larger sun gear either fixed to the motor vehicle or connected with the gear shafts. The arrangement of the planet gears is determined necessarily by the required engagement ratios.<br>
The design according to 10 is advantageous, as with the vehicle drive in most cases it is preferable, if at the same speed of the drive gears, for example when driving in a straight line, the drive output to the same parts is passed on to the drive gears   This is achieved by the arrangement according to the invention by having the same transmission ratios of the transmission devices for both drive lines.<br>
The design according to claim 11 has the advantage that any possible distribution of output to the drive lines is conceivable, when the transmissions of the gears arc set in a corresponding ratio relative to one another.<br><br>
The development according to claim 12 is advantageous, in that by means of an additional sun gear that can be coupled optionally rotation-fast relative to the vehicle a second transmission stage can be connected.<br>
According to a further design according to claim 13 a brake disc positioned rotation fast relative to the housing is provided. By means of this advantageous design a considerable simplification of the entire axial construction can be achieved, if for each drive line a magnetically operated braking device is provided, in which a ring fixed relative to the motor vehicle, the fuctional surface of which can be designed to be conical to increase the braking torque, acts on a corresponding opposite surface on the planet cage. As the planet cage runs at the high speed of the motor, the applied braking torque is increased by the transmission of the gear, so that a much greater braking torque acts on the gear shafts. The brake can be designed in such a way that that the friction ring in a currentless state of the activating magnet is forced by spring force against the planet cage, whereby the function of a hand brake is achieved By metering the application of the magnetic force of the activating magnet the described braking device can also be used as a pedal brake.<br>
It is also possible however to provide a friction surface, which at the same time acts on the motor frame on the one hand and on a part of the transmission device of the rotor drive line coupled with the rotor rotation on the other. By means of such a braking device both drive lines can be decelerated simultaneously.<br>
According to a design described in claim 14 there is a structural advantage in that in a normal case, that is with equal deceleration of both drive lines, no free reaction torque occurs which would have to be supported on the housing.<br>
The development according to claim 15 is also advantageous, as by the action of the brake on the fast-rotating components the torque is increased on the gear shafts by the transmission ratio,<br>
A design according to claim 16 has proved advantageous as a simple component is used as a brake.<br><br>
A design according to claim 17 is also possible as also in this case only the simplest mechanical components can be used,<br>
A design according to claim 18 is also advantageous, as by means of low activating forces a magnetic activation is entirely possible.<br>
According to a special design according to claim 19 for electromechanical transduction an asynchronous machine with a squirrel-cage rotor is provided. As with the drive according to the invention the motor frame is mounted rotatably on the associated output shaft, the supply of current to the motor must be made via slip rings on the periphery of the motor frame. For the electromechanical transduction preferably the principle of the asynchronous machine with squirrel-cage rotor is suitable, the rotational field of which is generated with driving speed dependent frequency control by electronic commutation. However any kind of electric driving macliine is conceivable in which a torque is produced between the stator and rotor.<br>
Lastly, a design as described in claim 20 is also possible. There are economical advantages to the jfbrmation of a standard component, which extend from the manufacture, stockkeeping of spare parts to sales. Furthermore, the bearing of the output-side sun gears of the transmission devices can be such that it permits the accommodation of gear forces, so that no additional axial bearing is necessary. However it is also possible to attach articulated shafts, in order to reduce the unsprung mass of the motor vehicle, and if necessary to increase the ground clearance between the drive gears.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail in the following by way of the embodiments illustrated in the drawings. Shown arc: Fig. 1   aschematic view of the drive;<br>

First of all it is noted that in the various described embodiments the same parts are allocated the same reference numbers or the same component names, whereby the disclosures contained throughout the description can be applied by analogy to the same parts with the same reference numbers or same component names. Also position details given in the description, such as e.g. top, bottom, side etc. relate to the Figure being described at the time and with a change of position should be transferred accordingly to the new position. Furthermore, individual features or combinations of features from the shown and described different embodiments can represent, independent, inventive solutions or solutions according to the invention.<br>
According to Fig. 1 the electric drive comprises a housing 1 that is fixed relative to the motor vehicle, from which on both sides a first drive line 2 and a second drive line 3 are guided. The torque of the first drive line 2 is provided by a shaft 25 of a freely rotatably mounted rotor 4, the torque of the second drive line 3 is provided by a stator 5, which is secured in a motor frame 6. The motor frame 6 is securely connected to a shaft end 23 of the second drive line 3. The rotational torque of the first drive line 2 moves a planet axis 7 of a planet gear set 8, which on the one hand engages with a sun gear 9 of the transmission device of the first drive line 2 fixed relative to the motor vehicle, and on the other hand with a sun gear 10 of the first drive line 2 rotatable with a gear shaft 43, In the transmission device of the first drive line 2 the fixed sun gear 9 is smaller than the rotatable sun gear 10, whereby the drive and output shaft of the transmission device are rotated in the same direction. Furthermore, the rotational movement of the second drive line 3 moves a planet axis 11 of a planet gear set 12, which on the one hand engages Avith a sun gear 13 of the transmission device of the second drive line 3 fixed relative to the motor vehicle and on the other hand with a sun gear 14 of the second drive line 3 rotatable with a gear shaft 28. In the transmission device of the second drive line 3 the fixed sun gear 13 is larger than the rotatable sun gear 14, whereby an opposite rotational movement of the drive and output shaft: of the transmission device is effected.<br>
Fig, 2 shows a schematic view of a two stage transmission device of a drive line 3, whereby the transmission device of the second drive line 2 has to be modified accordingly, in that a planet axis 15 rotates with the shaft end 23 on which a planet<br><br>
gear set 16 with three gears is rotatably mounted. The planet gear set 16 is on the one hand in engagement with freely rotatable sun gears 17, 18, which can be secured optionally or alternatively relative to the motor vehicle by a braking device 19, and on the other hand is in engagement with a sun gear 20, which is connected with the gear shaft 28.<br>
According to Fig. 3 the electric drive comprises the fixed housing 1, in which by means of roller bearings 21, 22 the freely rotatable motor frame 6, in which the stator 5 of the electric motor is secured, is mounted. The shaft end 23 firmly connected with the motor frame 6 is securely connected with a planet cage 24 of the transmission device, on the planet axis 11 of which the planet gear set 12 is mounted freely rotatably on roller bearings 26, 27. The planet gear set 12 engages on the one hand in the sun gear 13 fixed relative to the housing 1 and on the other hand in the sun gear 14 which is secured onto the right gear shaft 28. The gear shaft; 28 is mounted on two roller bearings 29,30 rotatably relative to the housing 1. The planet cage 24 is designed on the output side with a conical frictional surface 31, on which a brake disc 32 mounted rotation-fast relative to the housing 1 can rest. The brake disc 32 is in a position of rest forced by a disc spring 34 axiaily against the conical fuctional surface 31 of the planet cage 24. By means of an electromagnetic activation device 35 the axial force of the disc spring 34 can be overcome and thereby the brake can be lifted.<br>
The supply of electric power to an excitation winding 33 of the stator 5 is performed via carbon 36 on slip rings 37 on the rotatable motor fi-ame 6. The left drive line 2 is formed by the rotor 4 of the electric motor, which is rotatably mounted on the right side in the motor frame 6 by a roller bearing 38 and on the left side in the housing 3 also by a roller bearing 39, and is securely connected with a planet cage 40 of the left transmission device, on the planet axis 7 of which the planet gear set 8 is mounted fi-eely rotatably on roller bearings 41, 42. The planet gear set 8 engages on the one hand in the sun gear 9 fixed relative to the housing 1, and on the other hand in the sun gear 10, which is secured on the right gear shaft 43. The gear shaft 43 is mounted on two roller bearings 44,45 rotatably relative to the housing 1. The braking device with the brake disc 32 of the left drive line 2 is designed corresponding to the right drive line 3. The fixed sun gear 9 of the left drive line 2 is the same size as the rotatable sun gear 14 of the right drive line 3. The same applies to the sun gear 13 and sun gear 10<br><br>
As the rotational diameter of the planet axes 7 and 11 is of equal size, the transmission ratios for the left and right transmission device are produced.<br>
According to Fig. 4 the electric drive comprises the fixed housing 1, in wiiich by means of a roller bearing 46 the motor frame 6, which is securely connected to the planet cage 47, is mounted on one side. In the motor frame 6 the stator 5 and the rotor 4 with its shaft 25 are also provided. The rotor 4 is in turn securely connected with a planet cage 48, which is mounted by a roller bearing 49 in the housing 1. The second bearing of the rotor 4 is performed by a roller bearing 50 which is arranged in the motor frame 6.thesecond bearing of the motor frame 6 is made by a roller bearing 51 which is positioned on the shaft 25.<br>
The gear shaft 43 is on the one hand mounted by the roller bearing 44 arranged in the housing 1 and on the other hand by a roller bearing 52 provided in the planet cage 48. The gear shaft 28 is mounted by the roller bearing 30 arranged in the housing 1 and a roller bearing 53 provided in the motor frame 6.<br>
The planet gear for the gear shaft 43 with its planet cage 48 comprises a planet gear set 54 and a fixed sun gear 55 securely connected to the housing 1 and a sun gear 56 securely connected to the gear shaft 42. The planet gear for the gear shaft 28 with its planet cage 47 comprises technically analogously a planet gear set 57 and a fixed sun gear 58 securely connected with the housing 1 and a sun gear 59 securely connected with the gear shaft 28. The rotational movement of the rotor 4 or the motor frame 6 is transmitted by the planet gear, as in the embodiment according to Fig. 3, to the gear shafts28and43.<br>
As a braking device 19 a mechanical brake 60 is provided which acts on the outer periphery of the motor frame 6 or on the outer periphery of the planet cage 48 connected with the shaft 25. Said mechanical brake 60 is a divided ring which is activated by a cable pull 61.<br>
Finally, for form's sake it is noted that for a better understating of the structure of the drive, the latter and its components are illustrated partly untrue to scale and/or are enlarged and/or made smaller.<br><br>
