TITLE: PRINTING PLASTIC CONTAINERS WITH DIGITAL IMAGES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to plastic containers having digital images printed<br>
thereon, particularly curved plastic containers.<br>
Conventional techniques for printing onto curved plastic containers are subject to<br>
significant drawbacks. For example, it is difficult to obtain proper registration between<br>
colors, and changing images, designs or wording is expensive and time consuming.<br>
Inkjet printing with multiple nozzles is useful for flat surfaces. However, it is<br>
difficult to satisfactorily use multiple nozzles on curved surfaces.<br>
It would be highly desirable to print a digitally generated image directly onto a<br>
plastic container, particularly a curved plastic container, wherein the printing can be done<br>
at a reasonable speed and at a reasonable cost.<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for printing digital images or indicia directly onto<br>
a plastic container, particularly a curved, plastic container, and accomplishing this in a<br>
continuous operation at a reasonable speed and at a reasonable cost. Full color digital<br>
graphic images or indicia may be directly printed onto containers at multiple areas<br>
thereon.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a series of plastic containers are firmly<br>
held and moved to and from a first digital printing location and a first digital image is<br>
printed thereon at the first printing location on a first printing area on the containers, with<br>
the containers held at the top thereof and at a second position spaced from the top thereof,<br>
preferably at the base. Desirably, the containers are moved from the first digital printing<br>
location to a second digital printing location and a second digital image printed thereon<br>
on a second printing area on the containers spaced from the first printing area, with the<br>
containers held at the top thereof and at a second area spaced from the top, preferably at<br>
the base. The containers are preferably maintained under internal pressure while the<br>
digital image or images are printed thereon.<br>
The steps of digitally printing the digital image directly onto the plastic container<br>
prints the digital images directly onto a preformed container, for example onto an<br>
-2-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
injection molded or blow molded container, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or<br>
high density polyethylene (HDPE). The digital printing operation may print the digital<br>
image directly onto the plastic container as by jetting ink through an inkjet print head and<br>
onto the container surface. The ink may be a UV-reactive ink, in which case after<br>
printing the ink may be cured by exposure to UV light. One may also, for example, treat<br>
the container surface to be printed prior to the printing operation, as by flame treatment,<br>
corona treatment or plasma jet treatment.<br>
Further features of the present invention will be discussed hereinbelow.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be more readily understandable from a consideration of<br>
the following illustrative drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a top view of the container conveyer with containers;<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of one embodiment of the container flow and treatment;<br>
Figure 3 is a side view of an alternate embodiment of the container flow and<br>
treatment;<br>
-3-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of the container clamp assembly; and<br>
Figure 5 is an enlarged side view of an alternate embodiment of the container<br>
flow and treatment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1 - 3, a conveyer assembly 10 is provided to move<br>
the containers 11 through the treatment procedure in the direction of flow 12. The<br>
containers 11 enter the conveyer assembly from infeed conveyer 14 at container entry 16<br>
and are secured in container clamp assembly 18. The clamp assembly secures the<br>
containers 11 at two spaced areas, as shown in Figures 1 and 4, by container base holder<br>
20 and container top holder 22. It is preferred to hold the container at the top and bottom,<br>
although one could employ a top holder plus a second holder spaced therefrom, as on the<br>
sidewall. This prevents the containers from moving in any direction except for the<br>
direction of container flow 12. The base holder 20 and top holder 22 are synchronized to<br>
maintain the same velocity and relationship to each other at all times. Naturally, a<br>
commercial operation may have more than one conveyer assembly line.<br>
-4-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
As can be seen, particularly in Figures 2 and 3, the containers 11 are curved, as<br>
for example, round or oval, and have a container radius or curved portion 24. The<br>
container track 26 also contains a radius of the curved portion 28 at the first printing site<br>
30 which should substantially equal the container radius 24 to be printed in order to<br>
facilitate the digital printing operation.<br>
Upon clamping container 11 at the container entry 16 internal pressure is applied<br>
to the inside of the container via air pressure means 32 and pressure line 34 (Figure 4)<br>
through the clamp assembly 18, as for example, through top holder 22. Preferably, a<br>
pressure regulator 36 is provided to regulate the air pressure, as for example, from 0.125<br>
- 10.0 psi. This internal pressure will be maintained throughout the treatment procedure<br>
and provides a consistent distance of the container surface from the inkjet head and/or a<br>
consistent contact pressure for the container surface to the ink roller if the indirect inkjet<br>
method is used.<br>
As the containers enter the track curved portion or radius 28 they first pass<br>
through a first pre-treatment location A-l, see Figures 2 and 3. The pre-treatment<br>
location will serve to raise the surface energy of the container on the first container<br>
surface 38 to insure ink adhesion thereon, as for example, a heat treatment or corona<br>
treatment.<br>
-5-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
The containers will then pass the first printing site 30, area B-l in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
The containers will then have the first printing applied on the first container surface 38 at<br>
printing site 30, which may be a direct drop on demand inkjet head as shown in Figure 3,<br>
or an indirect drop on demand inkjet pad 40 as shown in Figure 2. U.V. ink will be<br>
applied directly to the first surface 38 of the containers in one pass. The inkjet may apply<br>
multicolor graphics of high quality as desired.<br>
The printed containers will then pass through a first curing station C-l, which will<br>
cure the ink or inks applied at the first printing site 30. This may be an ultra violet light<br>
source or other radiant curing method.<br>
The containers 11 then enter a straight section 42 of container track 26 where they<br>
are rotated, as for example, 180°, to expose second surface 44 of the containers to the<br>
second printing site 46, as by the clamp assembly 18 or other rotating means. The second<br>
container surface 44 is spaced from the first container surface 38, desirably an area<br>
opposed to the first container surface, as 180° therefrom.<br>
After rotation the containers 11 with container first surface 38 having printing<br>
thereon are moved through a second pre-treatment area A-2 where the surface energy of<br>
the container on the container second surface 44 is raised as at the first pre-treatment area<br>
A-l. The containers will then pass the second printing site 46, area B2, wherein the<br>
second printing will be performed on the second surface 44 of the containers.<br>
-6-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
Similar to first printing site 30, printing at the second printing site may be a direct drop<br>
on demand inkjet head as shown in Figure 3 or an indirect drop on demand inkjet pad 40<br>
as shown in Figure 2. Also, at the second printing site 46 U.V. ink will be applied<br>
directly to the second surface 44 of the containers in one pass, as multicolor graphics of<br>
high quality, as desired.<br>
  The printed containers will then pass through a second curing station C-2 which<br>
will cure the ink or inks applied at the second printing site. Here again, this may be an<br>
ultra violet light source other radiant curing method.<br>
The container clamp assembly 18 will then release the containers, printed on two<br>
sides or two locations and pass them on to an out-feed conveyer or storage and return to<br>
repeat the cycle.<br>
In the printing procedure it is desirable to maintain a plurality of print heads at a<br>
constant distance and perpendicularity from the non-planar container surface during the<br>
printing process. A plurality of print heads may be desirably articulated during the<br>
printing process to maintain a constant distance and perpendicularity from the non-planar<br>
container surface. A plurality of sensors may be use.d to measure the curvature of the<br>
non-planar surface and to control the articulation of the plurality of print heads to<br>
maintain the constant distance and perpendicularity from the non-planar surface. The<br>
print heads and/or container are desirably moved at a constant velocity relative to the<br>
-7-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
non-planar surface during the printing process. Also real time control is preferably<br>
provided to the printing control system to determine the relative position of the non-<br>
planar surface to the printing process. The foregoing features provide improved digital<br>
printing on the curved container surface.<br>
Thus, for example, as shown in Figure 5 which shows an enlarged view of the<br>
first printing site 30, area B-l, the conveyer system or container track 26 can be straight.<br>
The containers 11 with their container radius or curved portions 24 pass under print heads<br>
50 which are each separately movable up and down perpendicular to the direction of the<br>
container flow 52 in the direction of print head movement 54 by suitable motive means as<br>
articulation device 56. A constant distance or spacing between the container surface to<br>
be printed and the print heads is therefore maintained by the use of measuring device or<br>
sensor 58, such as a laser sensor, which determines the location of the surface to be<br>
printed and provides electronic feedback to the articulation device 56 for appropriately<br>
moving the print heads. Thus, as the containers pass under the print heads each head may<br>
move up and down as desired independent of each other and coordinated to the desired<br>
printing location. Subsequent processing will proceed in a manner after that shown in<br>
Figures 2 and 3 with a straight container track, desirably rotating the container, and<br>
printing at the second printing side.<br>
-8-<br><br>
04-212-1-PCT<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an improved procedure for printing digital<br>
images or indicia directly onto a curved plastic container. The procedure is continuous<br>
and efficient and enables two sides or two areas to be efficiently printed.<br>
It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the illustrations described<br>
and shown herein, which are deemed to be merely illustrative of the best modes of<br>
carrying out the invention, and which are susceptible of modification of form, size,<br>
arrangement of parts and details of operation. The invention rather is intended to<br>
encompass all such modifications which are within its spirit and scope as defined by the<br>
claims.<br>
