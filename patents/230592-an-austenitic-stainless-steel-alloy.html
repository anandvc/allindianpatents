Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an austenitic stainless steel alloy and in particular to a resulfurised Fe-Cr-Ni-Mn-Cu austenitic stainless steel alloy having improved machinability relative to AISI Type 203 stainless steel, with similar levels of corrosion resistance, strength, ductility, and magnetic permeability.<br>
Background, of the Invention<br>
AISI Type 303 stainless steel is among the most widely used of the known stainless steels.  Type 303 stainless steel is a resulfurized, Fe-Cr-Ni austenitic stainless steel having the following composition in weight percent (wt.%):<br>
wt.%<br>
C	0.15 max<br>
Mn	2.00 max<br>
Si	1.00 max<br>
p	0.20 max<br>
S	0.15 min<br>
Cr	17.0-19.0<br>
Ni	8.0-10.0<br>
Fe	Balance<br>
Type 303 stainless steel provides acceptable levels of corrosion resistance and machinability for many applications.  However, its relatively high nickel content subjects it to significant variations in cost as the price of nickel fluctuates in the market.<br>
AISI Type 203 stainless steel is a resulfurized, Fe-Cr-Ni-Mn-Cu austenitic stainless steel having the following composition in weight percent (wt. %)<br>
wt. %<br>
C	0.08 max<br>
Mn	5.00 - 6.50<br>
Si	1.00 max:<br>
p	0.040 max<br>
'S •	0.18-0.35<br>
Cr	16.00 - 18.00<br>
Ni	5,00 - 6.50<br>
Mo	0,50 max<br>
Cu	1,75-2,25<br>
The balance of the alloy composition is essentially iron and commercial grades of Type 203 stainless steels typically include about. 0.03 - 0.05 weight percent nitrogen.  Type 203 (Stainless steel contains significantly less nickel than the Type 303 alloy and La useful for many of the same applications as the Type 303 alloy, particularly those that require a combination of good machinability, non-magnetic behavior, and good corrosion resistance.  Type 203 stainless steel exhibits improved drilling characteristics relative to Type 303.stainless steel when both alloys contain about the same amount of sulfur.  This improvement in drill machinability is attributed to the relatively larger amounts of manganese and copper present in the Type 203 alloy.<br>
The benefit to machinability of reducing carbon and nitrogen in certain Fe-Cr-Ni austenitic stainless Steels such as Type 303, Type 304, and Type 316 is known.  However, a similar benefit in an Fe-Cr-Ni-Mn-Cu austenitic stainless steel such as Type 203 has not been demonstrated-  Hitherto, no significant improvement in machinability from lowering carbon and nitrogen was expected in such stainless steels, because they were thought to have optimal machinability due, at least in part, to the increased stability of. the austenitic microstructure.  With the<br>
ever rising demand for machinable stainless steel alloys; and the continued demand to control the cost of products made from such alloys, a need has arisen for an Fe-Cr-Ni -Mn-Cu austenitic stainless steel having better machinability than Type 203 alloy, particularly under large scale, production -type machining such as on an automatic screw machine.<br>
o£ the Invention<br>
The alloy according to the present invention is an austenitic stainless steel that provides improved machinability compared to AISI Type 203 alloy.  The broad, intermediate, and preferred compositional ranges of the austenitic stainless steel of the alloy are as follows, in weight percent:<br>
Broad	Intermediate   Preferred<br>
C	0.035 max	0.030 max	0,025 max<br>
Mn3-10	4-8	5-7<br>
Si	1.0 max	1.0 max	1.0 max<br>
p	0.05 max	0.05 max	0.05 max<br>
S	0,15 - 0.45	0.20 - 0.40	0.25 - 0.35<br>
Cr	10 - 20	12 - 18	14 - 17<br>
Ni	4 - 10	5-8	5.5-7<br>
Mo	1.0 max	1.0 max	1.0 max<br>
Cu	1.0 - 3.0	1.5 - 2.5	1.75 - 2.25<br>
N	0.035 max	0.030 max	0.025 max<br>
B	0.005 max	0.005 max	0.005 max<br>
Se	0.1 max	0.1 max	0.1 max<br>
The balance of the alloy is essentially iron except for the usual impurities found in commercial grades of such steels and minor amounts of additional elements which may vary from a few thousandths of a percent up •to larger amounts that do not objectionably detract from the desired combination of properties provided by this alloy.<br>
The foregoing tabulation is provided as a<br>
convenient summary and is noc intended thereby to resatriet the lower and upper values of the ranges of the individual elements of the alloy of this invention for use in combination with each other, or to restrict the ranges of the elements for use solely in combination with each other.  Thus, one or more of the element ranges of the broad composition can be used with one or more of the other ranges for the remaining elements in the preferred composition.  In addition, a Minimum or maximum for an element of one preferred embodiment can be used with the maximum or minimum for that element from another preferred embodiment. Throughout this application, unless otherwise indicated, percent (%) means percent by weight.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embdoiments<br>
In the alloy according to the present invention, carbon and nitrogen are each restricted to not more 1:han about 0.035% and better yet to not more than about 0.030% to benefit the machinability-of this<br>
allOy.       <br>
nitrogen are each restricted to not more than about' 0.025%.<br>
However, such low amounts of carbon and nitrogen can result in undesirable amounts of ferrite (about 10% by weight) and reduced stability of the austenitic microatructure when cold worked or machined. Accordingly, at least about 4%, better yet at least about 5%, and preferably at least about 5.5% nickel is present in the alloy to prevent excessive ferrite and promote austenite stability when the alloy is cold worked or machined.  However, too much nickel adversely affects the hot workability of this alloy. Therefore, nickel is restricted to not more than about<br>
10%, better yet to not more than about 8%, and preferably to not more than about 7%.<br>
At least about 3%, better yet at least about 4V, and preferably at least about 5% manganese is present to promote the formation of manganese-rich sulfides which benefit machinability.  In addition, free manganese reduces the work hardening rate and stabilizes the austenitic structure of the alloy during cold working or machining, which is essential at low nickel levels.  However, manganese is restricted to not more than about 10%, better yet to not more than about 8%, and preferably to not more than about 7% because too much manganese impairs cerronion resistance and can result; in the formation of undesirable amounts of ferrite.<br>
At leaat about 1.0%, better yet at least about 1.5%, and preferably at least about 1.75% copper is present in the alloy to reduce the work hardening rate and stabilize the austenite when the alloy is cold worked, and benefit the machinability of the alloy. Also, copper is present to prevent excessive ferrite formation.  However, too much copper leads to tearing when the alloy is hot worked.  Therefore, copper is restricted to not more than about 3.0%, better yet to not more than about 2.5%, and preferably to not more than about 2 . 25% .<br>
In the alloy according to the present invention, the elements carbon, nitrogen, nickel, manganese, and copper are balanced to insure that the alloy provides superior machinability, while maintaining a low magnetic permeability, despite the low carbon, nitrogen, and nickel contents.  The manganese and copper contents are critical in achieving those characteristics.<br>
range.  Further, although molybdenum is normally present at residual levels in the alloy, a positive addition of molybdenum, up to about 1,0%, can be present in this alloy to benefit pitting corrosion resistance.<br>
The balance of the alloy is essentially iron apart from the usual impurities found in commercial grades of stainless steels intended for similar service or use.  The levels of such elements are controlled so as not to adversely affect the desired properties.  In particular, although silicon can be present in the alloy from deoxidizing additions during melting, silicon is restricted to not more than about 1.0% because it strongly promotes ferrite formation, particularly with the very low carbon and nitrogen present in this alloy.  Additionally, not more than about 0.05% phosphorus is present in the alloy because phosphorus contributes to embrittlement of the alloy and adversely affects its machinability.<br>
No special techniques are required in melting, casting, or working the alloy of the present invention.  Arc melting followed by argon-oxygen decarburization is the preferred method of melting and refining, but other practices can be employed.  In addition, this alloy can be made using powder metallurgy techniques, such as powder injecticn molding, and metal injection molding techniques.  This alloy can also be prepared using continuous casting techniques.<br>
The alloy of the present invention can be formed into a variety of shapes for a wide variety of uses and lends it self to the formation of billets, bars rod, wire, strip, plate, or sheet using conventional processes.  Further, the alloy of the present<br>
irivention is useful in a wide range of product applications.  The superior machinability of the alloy makes it highly suitable for applications requiring Large scale machining of parts, especially using automated machining equipment.<br>
Examples<br>
in order to demonstrate the unique combination of properties provided by the alloy according to the present invention, Examples 1 and 2 of the alloy having the compositions in weight percent shown in Table l were prepared.  For comparison purposes, Heat A with a composition outside the range of the alloy according to this invention was also prepared. The weight percent composition of Heat A is also included in Table 1.  Heat A is representative of a commercial version of AISI Type 203 alloy containing significantly higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen than the present alloy.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Examples 1 and 2 and Heat A were prepared from 400 1b. heats which were induction melted under a partial pressure of argon and cast as 7.5 in. ('1:3.0 cm) square ingots.  The ingots were pressed to 4 in. (10.2 cm) square billets from a temperature of<br>
2300°F (1260°C) .  The billets were ground to remove any surface defects and the ends were cut off.  The billets were then rolled to 2.125 in. (5.40 cm) diameter bars.  The bars were reheated and then processed by hot rolling to a diameter of 0.718 in. (18.2 mm) from a temperature of 2350°F (1290°C),  The bars were straightened, turned to a diameter of 0.668 in. (17,0 mm), pointed for cold drawing, solution annealed at 19500F (1066°C) for 0.5 hours, and then water quenched.  The bars were then cleaned, cold drawn to a diameter of 0.637 in. (16.2 mm), straightened, and ground to a diameter of- 0.625 in. (15.9 mm) .<br>
To evaluate machinability, samples of Examples 1 ahd 2 and Heat A were tested on an automatic screw machine,  A first form tool was used to machine the 0.625 in. (15.9 mm) diameter bars to provide parts having a contoured surface defined by a small diameter of 0.392 in. (10.0 mm) and a large diameter of 0.545 in. (13,8 mm).  The large diameter was then finished, using a second or finishing form tool, to a diameter of 0.530 in, (13.5 mm).  As a consequence of gradual wear induced on the first form tool by the machining process, the small diameter of the machined parts gradually increases.  The testa were terminated when a 0.003 in, (0.076 mm) increase in the small diameter of the machined parts was observed.  The tests were performed at .speeds of 189.1 and 205.7 sfpm with a first form tool feed of 0.002 ipr using a conmercially available cutting fluid.  Improved machinability is demonstrated when a significantly higher number of parts is machined compared to a reference material.<br>
The results of the machinability teats are shown<br>
in Table 2 as the number of parts machined (# of Parts),  Each alloy was tested in two separate runs at X89.1 sfpm and five separate runs at 205.7 sfpm.  The average values (Avg.) for each set of measurements are included in the table.  The weight percents of carbon, manganese, nickel, copper, and nitrogen are also included in Table 2 for convenient reference.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Test terminated without a 0.003 in. (0,076 mm) increase in the small diameter of Che machined part,<br>
To evaluate mechanical properties, the 0.625 in. (].5.9 mm) bars of Examples 1 and 2, as well as Heat A, were annealed at 19500F (1066°C) for 0.5 hours then waiter quenched,  Some, of the barn were then cold drawn until the diameter was reduced by 9%  All of the bars were then rough turned to produce smooth tensile specimens.  Each specimen was cylindrical with an overall length of 3.5 in. (8.9 cm) and a diameter of 0.5 in. (1.27 cm).  A 1.0 in. (2.54 cm) long section at the center of each specimen was reduced in diameter to 0.25 in. (0.64 cm) with a minimum radius of 0.1875 in, (0.476 cm) connecting the center section to each end section of the specimen.<br>
The mechanical properties of Examples 1 and 2 were compared with the properties of Heat A.  The properties measured include the 0.2% yield strength (.2% YS) , the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the percent elongation in four diameters (% Elong.), and the percent reduction in area (% Red.).  All of the properties were measured along the longitudinal direction.  The results of the measurements are given in Tables 3a and 3b.  The specimens used to generate the data in Table 3a were prepared from the annealed bars, whereas the specimens used to generate the data in Table 3b were prepared from the annealed and cold drawn bars.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 4 shows the results of Rockwell hardness tasting and magnetic permeability measurements for Examples 1 and 2 and Heat A.  The magnetic permeability was measured using a Severn gage.  Both properties were measured on each of three separate specimens.  The reported hardness values represent an average of four separate measurements on each specimen.<br>
Table 4<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The data presented in Table 2 clearly show the superior machinability of Examples 1 and 2 compared to Heat A at the lower machining speed.  Although there appears to be some overlap in individual results at the high machining speed, overall, the data show that Examples 1 and 2 are capable of providing significantly better machinability than Heat A.  The data in Tables 3a, 3b, and 4 show that Examples 1 and 2 provide strength, ductility, hardness, and magnetic properties that are similar to Heat A.  Thus, when considered as a whole, the data presented in Tables 2-4 illustrate the superior machinability of Examples 1 and 2 without a significant adverse effect on other desired properties of a resulfurized auatenitic stainless steel.<br>
