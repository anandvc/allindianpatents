				<td>The present invention is directed to peptide analogues of glucagon-like peptide-1, the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, to methods of using such analogues to treat mammals and to pharmaceutical compositions useful therefore comprising said analogues.<br>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is synthesized in the intestinal L-cells by tissue-specific post-translational processing of the glucagon precursor preproglucagon (Varndell, J.M., et al., J. Histochem Cytochem, 1985:33:1080-6) and is released into the circulation in response to a meal. The plasma concentration of GLP-1 rises from a fasting level of approximately 15 pmol/L to a peak postprandial level of 40 pmol/L. It has been demonstrated that, for a given rise in plasma glucose concentration, the increase in plasma insulin is approximately threefold greater when glucose is administered orally compared with intravenously (Kreymann, B., et al., Lancet 1987:2, 1300-4). This alimentary enhancement of insulin release, known as the incretin effect, is primarily humoral and GLP-1 is now thought to be the most potent physiological incretin in humans. In addition to the insulinotropic effect, GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying (Wettergren A., et al.t Dig Dis Sci 1993:38:665-73) and may enhance peripheral glucose disposal (D'Alessio, D.A. et al., J. Clin Invest 1994:93:2293-6).<br>
In 1994, the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 was suggested following the observation that a single subcutaneous (sic) dose of GLP-1 could completely normalize postprandial glucose levels in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (Gutniak, M.K., et al., Diabetes Care 1994:17:1039-44). This effect was thought to be mediated both by increased insulin release and by a reduction in glucagon secretion. Furthermore, an intravenous infusion of GLP-1 has been shown to delay postprandial gastric emptying in patients with NIDDM (Williams, B., et al., J. Clin Endo Metab 1996:81:327-32). Unlike sulphonylureas, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 is dependent on plasma glucose concentration (Holz, G.G. 4th, et al., Nature 1993:361:362-5). Thus, the loss of GLP-1-mediated insulin release at low plasma glucose concentration protects against severe<br><br>
hypoglycemia. This combination of actions gives GLP-1 unique potential therapeutic advantages over other agents currently used to treat NIDDM.<br>
Numerous studies have shown that when given to healthy subjects, GLP-1 potently influences glycemic levels as well as insulin and glucagon concentrations (Orskov, C, Diabetologia 35:701-711, 1992; Hoist, J.J., et al., Potential of GLP-1 in diabetes management in Glucagon III, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Lefevbre PJ, Ed. Berlin, Springer Vertag, 1996, p. 311-326), effects which are glucose dependent (Kreymann, B., et al., Lancet ii: 1300-1304, 1987; Weir, G.C., et al., Diabetes 38:338-342, 1989). Moreover, it is also effective in patients with diabetes (Gutniak, M., N. Engl J Med 226:1316-1322, 1992; Nathan, D.M., et al., Diabetes Care 15:270-276, 1992), normalizing blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic subjects (Nauck, M.A., et al., Diagbetologia 36:741-744, 1993), and improving glycemic control in type 1 patients (Creutzfeldt, W.O., et al., Diabetes Care 19:580-586,1996), raising the possibility of its use as a therapeutic agent.<br>
GLP-1 is, however, metabolically unstable, having a plasma half-life (t1/2) of only 1-2 min in vivo. Exogenously administered GLP-1 is also rapidly degraded (Deacon, C.F., et al., Diabetes 44:1126-1131,1995). This metabolic instability limits the therapeutic potential of native GLP-1. Hence, there is a need for GLP-1 analogues that are more active or are more metabolically stable than native GLP-1.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The peptides of this invention can be prepared by standard solid phase peptide synthesis. See, e.g., Stewart, J.M., et al., Solid Phase Synthesis (Pierce Chemical Co., 2d ed. 1984). The substituents R2 and R3 of the above generic formula may be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C,-CM)alkylf may be attached using reductive alkylatlon. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (Cr C((hydroxyalkyl, may also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxy group is protected with a t-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., COE\ may be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., E'COOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxy group, e.g., p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBT.<br>
When R1 is NH-X2-CH2-CONH2, (i.e., Z((CONHa), the synthesis of the peptide starts with BocHN-X2-CH2-COOH which is coupled to the MBHA resin. If R1 is NH-X2-CH2-COOH, (i.e., Z°=COOH) the synthesis of the peptide starts with Boc-HN-X2-CH2-COOH which is coupled to PAM resin. For this particular step, 4 molar equivalents of Boc-HN-X2-COOHV HBTU and HOBt and 10 molar equivalents of DIEA are used. The coupling time is about 8 hours.<br>
The protected amino acid 1-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-amino)-1-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid (Boc-A6c-OH) was synthesized as follows. 19.1 g (0.133 mol) of 1-amino-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Acros Organics, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was dissolved in 200 ml of dioxane and 100 ml of water. To it was added 67 ml of 2N NaOH. The solution was cooled in an ice-water bath. 32.0 g (0.147 mol) of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate was added to this solution. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Dioxane was then removed under reduced pressure. 200 ml of ethyl acetate was added to the remaining aqueous solution. The mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath. The pH of the aqueous layer was adjusted to about 3 by adding 4N HCI.   The organic layer was separated. The<br><br>
aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (1 x 100 ml). The two organic layers were combined and washed with water (2 x 150 ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was recrystallized in ethyl acetate/hexanes. 9.2 g of the pure product was obtained. 29% yield.<br>
Boc-A5c-OH was synthesized in an analogous manner to that of Boc-A6c-OH. Other protected Ace amino acids can be prepared in an analogous manner by a person of ordinary skill in the art as enabled by the teachings herein.<br>
In the synthesis of a GLP-1 analogue of this invention containing A5c, A6c and/or Aib, the coupling time is 2 hrs. for these residues and the residue immediately following them. For the synthesis of (Tma-His7)hGLP-1(7-36)NH2, HBTU (2 mmol) and DIEA (1.0 ml) in 4 ml DMF are used to react with the N-terminal free amine of the peptide-resin in the last coupling reaction; the coupling time is about 2 hours.<br>
The substituents R2 and R3 of the above generic formula can be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C1-C30)alkyl, can be attached using reductive alkylation. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (C1-C30)hydroxyalkylt can also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxy group is protected with a t-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., COX1, can be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., X1COOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino add by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for about one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxy group, e.g., p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBT.<br>
A compound of the present invention can be tested for activity as a GLP-1 binding compound according to the following procedure. Ceil Culture:<br>
RIN 5F rat insulinoma cells (ATCC-# CRL-2058, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), expressing the GLP-1 receptor, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, and maintained at about 37 °C in a humidifed atmosphere of 5% C02/95% air. Radioligand Binding:<br>
Membranes    were    prepared    for    radioligand    binding    studies    by<br><br>
homogenization of the RIN cells in 20 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCI with a Brinkman Polytron (Westbury, NY) (setting 6, 15 sec). The homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation (39.000 g / 10 min), and the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCI, containing 2.5 mM MgCI2, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO)f and 0.1% BSA. For assay, aliquots (0.4 ml) were incubated with 0.05 nM (125l)GLP-1(7-36) (-2200 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA), with and without 0.05 ml of unlabeled competing test peptides. After a 100 min incubation (25 °C), the bound (t25l)GLP-1(7-36) was separated from the free by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), which had been previously soaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The filters were then washed three times with 5 ml aliquots of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCI, and the bound radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted by gamma spectrometry (Waliac LKB, Gaithersburg, MO). Specific binding was defined as the total (125l)GLP-1(7-36) bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM GLP1(7-36) (Bachem, Torrence, CA).<br>
The   peptides   of   this   invention   can   be   provided   in   the   form   of<br>
pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts.   Examples of such salts include, but are not<br>
limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic,<br>
ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid),<br>
inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and<br>
polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic,<br>
or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a<br>
peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished<br>
by standard methods of salt exchange* Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the<br>
present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using<br>
preparative HPLC, eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted<br>
into another salt, such as an acetate salt by dissolving the peptide in a small<br>
amount of 0.25 N acetifi acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to<br>
a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1)<br>
0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs., (2) 0.25N acetic acid<br>
aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs. and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B<br>
over 30 min.) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous<br>
solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions<br>
containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.<br><br>
As is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of GLP-1 is varied and multitudinous (See, Todd, J.F., et al., Clinical Science, 1998, 95, pp. 325-329; and Todd, J.F. et al., European Journal of Clinical Investigation, 1997, 27, pp.533-536). Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of eliciting an agonist effect can have the same effects and uses as GLP-1 itself. These varied uses of GLP-1 may be summarized as follows, treatment of: Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, obesity, glucagonomas, secretory disorders of the airway, metabolic disorder, arthritis, osteoporosis, central nervous system diseases, restenosis, neurodegenerative diseases, renal failure, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, pulmonary edema, hypertension, and disorders wherein the reduction of food intake is desired. GLP-1 analogues of the present invention that elicit an antagonist effect from a subject can be used for treating the following: hypoglycemia and malabsorption syndrome associated with gastrectomy or small bowel resection.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one of the compounds of formula (I) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1x10"' to 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1x10* to 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual or topical routes of administration and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating<br><br>
homogenization of the RIN cells in 20 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCI with a Brinkman Polytron (Westbury, NY) (setting 6, 15 sec). The homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation (39,000 g / 10 min), and the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCI, containing 2.5 mM MgCI2, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO), and 0.1% BSA.

Specific binding was defined as the total (125l)GLP-1(7-36) bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM GLP1(7-36) (Bachem, Torrence, CA).<br>
