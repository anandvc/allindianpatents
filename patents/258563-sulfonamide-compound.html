				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Sulfonamide Compound<br>
[0001]<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel sulfonamide compound or a salt<br>
thereof, or a derivative thereof useful as a prodrug. The present invention also<br>
relates to a medicament comprising said novel sulfonamide compound or a salt thereof,<br>
or a derivative thereof which is a prodrug as an active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Movements of cells include contraction, migration, release, aggregation and<br>
the like, and phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is important for<br>
these cell movements. The myosin regulatory light chain is a subunit having a<br>
molecular weight of 20 kDa and constituting myosin, which exists in smooth muscle<br>
cells and various non-muscle cells such as neutrophils, platelets and nerve cells of<br>
warm-blooded animals (Barany, K., et al., Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction,<br>
pp.21-35, 1996). Myosin existing in smooth muscle cells and various non-muscle cells<br>
such as neutrophils, platelets and nerve cells of warm-blooded animals is constituted<br>
by a myosin heavy chain subunit having a molecular weight of about 200 kDa, the<br>
myosin regulatory light chain subunit having a molecular weight of about 20 kDa, and<br>
a myosin constitutive light chain subunit having a molecular weight of about 17 kDa.<br>
[0003]<br>
The myosin regulatory light chain is mainly phosphorylated by the myosin<br>
light chain kinase to increase the activity of myosin ATPase existing in the myosin<br>
heavy chain subunit (Barany, M., et al., Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction,<br>
pp.321-339, 1996). It is known that the activated myosin having the increased<br>
ATPase activity becomes possible to interact with actin and activates movement<br>
apparatuses of cytoskeleton to activate cell movements. That is, it is known that<br>
activation of myosin relates to cell contraction (Kamm, K., et al., Annu. Rev. Physiol.,<br>
51, pp.299-313, 1989). It is also known that activation of myosin relates to change of<br>
cell morphology (Schmidt, J.T. et al., J, Neurobiol., 52 (3), pp.175-188, 2002). It is<br>
known that activation of myosin relates to cell migration (Niggli, V., FEBS Lett., 445,<br>
1<br><br>
pp.69-72, 1999). Further, it is known that activation of myosin relates to cell release<br>
(Kitani, S., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 183, pp.48-54, 1992). It is<br>
further known that activation of myosin relates to cell aggregation (Itoh, K., et al.,<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1136, pp.52-56, 1992). It is also known that activation of<br>
myosin relates to cell apoptosis (Mills, J.C. et al., J. Cell Biol., Vol. 140, No. 3,<br>
pp.627-636, 1998). Based on these findings, it is considered that an agent which<br>
inhibits the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain suppresses cell<br>
contraction, regulates change of cell morphology, suppresses cell migration, suppresses<br>
cell release, suppresses cell aggregation and suppresses cell apoptosis.<br>
[0004]<br>
Cell contraction is deeply involved in diseases relating to contraction of<br>
various smooth muscle layers. Examples of such diseases include, for example,<br>
hypertension (Samlyo, A.P., et al., Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol., Vol. 134,<br>
pp.209"34, 1999), angina pectoris (Shimokawa et al., Cardiovasc. Res., Vol. 43, No. 4,<br>
pp.1029-39, 1999; Satoh, H., et al., Jpn. J. Pharmacol, 79 (suppl.), p.211, 1999),<br>
cerebral vascular spasm (M. Satoh et al., the 57th General Meeting of Japan<br>
Neurosurgical Society, Collection of Abstracts, 153, 1998; N. Ono et al., Pharmacol.<br>
Ther., Vol. 82, No. 2-3, pp.123-31, 1991; Shimokawa et al., Cardiovasc. Res., Vol. 43, No.<br>
4, pp. 1029-39, 1999), erectile dysfunction (Andersson, KE. et al., World J. Vrol., 15,<br>
pp. 14-20, 1997), bronchial asthma (K. Iidzuka, Allergy, 47, 943, 1998; K. Iidzuka et al.,<br>
Jpn. J. Respirology Society, 37, 196, 1999) and the like.<br>
[0005]<br>
Change of cell morphology is deeply involved in diseases relating to<br>
morphological change of various cells. Examples of the diseases relating to change of<br>
cell morphology include, for example, as those relating to nerve cells of eyes, various<br>
nerve dysfunctions such as diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma (Arakawa, Y., et al.,<br>
BIO Clinica, 17 (13), pp.26-28, 2002). Further, cell migration is deeply involved in<br>
diseases relating to migration of various cells. Examples of such diseases include, for<br>
example, cancer invasion and metastasis (Itoh, K. et al., Nat. Med., Vol. 5, No. 2,<br>
pp.221-5, 1999; Keely, P. et al., Trends Cell Biol., Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 101-6, 1998),<br>
nephritis (Fujimoto, O. et al., Journal of Japanese Society of Internal Medicine, 88 (l),<br>
pp. 148-58, 1998) and the like.<br>
[0006]<br>
2<br><br>
Furthermore, it is considered that cell release is deeply involved in various<br>
allergies and the like (Keane-Myers A. et al., Curr. Allergy Asthma Rep., l(6):550-557,<br>
2001), and further, cell aggregation is considered to be deeply involved in thrombosis<br>
and the like (Nakai, K. et al., Blood, Vol. 90, No. 10, pp.3736-42., 1997). Further, it is<br>
known that cell apoptosis is involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and glaucoma, viral diseases, hepatic<br>
diseases and the like (Thompson, C.B., Science, Vol. 267, pp. 1456-1462, 1995).<br>
[0007]<br>
Based on these findings, it is considered that a substance having an inhibitory<br>
action on the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain is useful as an active<br>
ingredient of a medicament for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of a disease<br>
relating to cell contraction, disease relating to change of cell morphology, disease<br>
relating to cell migration, disease relating to cell release, disease relating to cell<br>
aggregation, and/or disease relating to cell apoptosis.<br>
[0008]<br>
As agents inhibiting the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain,<br>
isoquinoline derivatives are known. For example, it has been reported that<br>
l-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H&gt;7) inhibits the phosphorylation of<br>
myosin regulatory light chain of mesenteric artery (Non-patent document l), and there<br>
are also known drugs inhibiting the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain<br>
of iris smooth muscle (Non-patent document 2), and astrocyte (Non-patent document 3).<br>
Further, 5-substituted isoquinoline derivatives are also known (Patent document 1).<br>
However, the N atom of sulfonamide in these 5-substituted isoquinoline derivatives<br>
does not form a ring, and thus they have a structure different from that of the<br>
compounds of the present invention. Further, tricyclic compounds are also known<br>
(Patent document 2). However, these compounds are tricyclic compounds and do not<br>
have sulfonamide, and therefore they are structurally different from the compounds of<br>
the present invention.<br>

formula (l) can be prepared by, for example, the following methods. However, the<br>
preparation methods of the compounds of the present invention are not limited to the<br>
following preparation methods.<br>
In each reaction, reaction time is not particularly limited. Advance of the<br>
reactions can be readily monitored by the analysis means described later, and<br>
therefore the reactions may be terminated when yields of the objective substances<br>
reach the maximum.<br>
The compound represented by the general formula (l) can be decomposed into<br>
a compound represented by the formula (4) and a compound represented by the<br>
formula (5) according to the following reaction route. Therefore, the compounds of the<br>
present invention can be prepared by the synthesis route reverse to the following<br>
reaction route.<br>
[0064]<br>
(Preparation method l)<br>
[Formula 3]<br>
60<br><br><br>
For example, the compounds represented by the general formula (l) can be<br>

same meanings as those defined above, G2a, G3a, G4a and G5a have the same meanings<br>

above, Gla is chlorine atom, hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, or amino group, and<br>

G5a are the same groups as G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5, respectively, the compounds of the<br>

hydrogen atom] can be prepared from a compound of the formula (2) wherein G4a is<br>

inhibitory action on cell migration (the action will be abbreviated as "cell migration<br>
inhibitory action") can be confirmed by measuring neutrophil migration inhibitory<br>
activity, respiratory tract inflammation suppressing activity, or the like. The cell<br>
release inhibitory action can be confirmed by measuring the chemical mediator<br>
releasing amount from neutrophils. The cell aggregation inhibitory action can be<br>
confirmed by measuring platelet aggregation inhibitory activity, or the like. Further,<br>
the apoptosis inhibitory action can be confirmed by, for example, giving stimulation to<br>
induce apoptosis to cells and then measuring cell viability or occurring frequencies of<br>
morphological changes of cells characteristic to apoptosis such as nuclear condensation,<br>
nuclear fragmentation, and blebbing of cells. However, since the cell movement<br>
inhibitory actions on the basis of the inhibition of phosphorylation of the myosin<br>
80<br><br>
regulatory light chain in the cells are known to be associated with various biological<br>
actions as described in the section of background art in the specification, the<br>
aforementioned cell contraction inhibitory action, action to regulate change of cell<br>
morphology, cell migration inhibitory action, cell release inhibitory action, cell<br>
aggregation inhibitory action, and apoptosis inhibitory action should be construed to<br>
constitute a part of the actions of the medicament of the present invention.<br>
[0098]<br>
More specifically, the compounds of the present invention represented by the<br>
aforementioned formula (l) and physiologically acceptable salts thereof have an<br>
inhibitory activity against phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (see,<br>
Test Example 1 of the specification), vasoconstriction inhibitory activity, activity for<br>
suppressing respiratory tract constriction induced by antigen stimulation, intraocular<br>
pressure reducing activity (see, Test Example 2 in the specification), neutrophil<br>
migration inhibitory activity (see, Test Example 3 in the specification), respiratory<br>
tract inflammation suppressing activity, pulmonary inflammation suppressing activity,<br>
trachea relaxation activity, and activity for suppressing respiratory tract constriction<br>
induced by a constriction elicitor. Therefore, the compounds represented by the<br>
aforementioned formula (l) and physiologically acceptable salts thereof as well as<br>
derivatives thereof useful as prodrugs are useful as active ingredients of medicaments<br>
for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases relating to contraction of<br>
various cells, diseases relating to morphological change of various cells, diseases<br>
relating to migration of various cells, diseases relating to release of various cells,<br>
diseases relating to aggregation of various cells, diseases relating to apoptosis of<br>
various cells, and the like.<br>
[0099]<br>
Although it is not intended to be bound by any specific theory, action<br>
mechanism of the compounds of the present invention represented by the<br>
aforementioned general formula (l) and salts thereof can be presumed as follows. It<br>
is known that increase of the amount of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain<br>
activates the actomyosin system, which is a movement apparatus of cytoskeleton, and<br>
activates cell movements. Therefore, it is considered that the phosphorylation<br>
reaction of myosin regulatory light chain is important for cell movements (Kamm, K.,<br>
et al., Annu. Rev. Physiol., 51, pp.299-313, 1989; Niggli, V., FEBS Lett., 445, pp.69-72,<br>
81<br><br>
1999; Itoh, K., et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1136, pp.52-56, 1992; Kitani, S., et al.,<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 183, pp.48"54, 1992). Measurement of the amount<br>
of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain in the cells revealed that the<br>
compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (l) and salts thereof decrease<br>
the amount of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain in the cells (refer to Test<br>
Example 1 in the specification).<br>
[0100]<br>
It is known that the amount of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain<br>
in the cells is determined by activated states of two reaction routes including Reaction<br>
route 1 and Reaction route 2 described below (Fukata, Y., et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci.,<br>
22, pp.32-39, 2001).<br><reaction route><br>
Increase of intracellular calcium concentration —» Activation of myosin light chain<br>
kinase —&gt; Increase of amount of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain<br><reaction route><br>
Activation of low molecular weight G protein Rho —* Activation of Rho kinase —*<br>
Phosphorylation (inactivation) of myosin phosphatase -* Increase of amount of<br>
phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain<br>
It is considered that a compound that inhibits Reaction route 1 and/or<br>
Reaction route 2 mentioned above has an activity for decreasing the amount of<br>
phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain. In order to estimate whether either or<br>
both of Reaction route 1 and Reaction route 2 mentioned above are the target site for<br>
the compounds of the present invention represented by the aforementioned formula (l)<br>
and salts thereof, effects of the compounds of the present invention represented by the<br>
aforementioned formula (l) and salts thereof on increase of intracellular calcium<br>
concentration and activity of myosin light chain kinase were examined. As a result, it<br>
was found that the compounds of the present invention and salts thereof gave no<br>
influence on the increase of intracellular calcium concentration (see, Test Example 4),<br>
and did not inhibit the myosin light chain kinase activity (see, Test Example 5).<br>
Therefore, it is presumed that the compounds of the formula (l) according to the<br>
present invention do not inhibit Reaction route 1 mentioned above, but inhibit<br>
Reaction route 2 mentioned above to decrease the amount of phosphorylated myosin<br>
regulatory light chain. Thus, the compounds of the present invention and salts<br>
82<br><br>
thereof can be used as inhibitors of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway. The inhibition of<br>
Reaction route 2 mentioned above by the compounds of the present invention<br>
represented by the aforementioned formula (l) and salts thereof may be confirmed by<br>
measuring the inhibitory activity for the Rho kinase activity, or alternatively, by<br>
measuring the inhibitory activity for the phosphorylation reaction of myosin<br>
phosphatase.<br>
[0101]<br>
The activity of Rho kinase can be measured by, for example, the method<br>
disclosed in WOO 1/56988. More specifically, ATP (y 32P-ATP) is added to a substrate<br>
(Ribosomal S6 kinase substrate) together with a commercially available Rho kinase<br>
(Upstate) to start the enzymatic reaction and phosphorylate the substrate. The<br>
substrate is adsorbed on filter paper, and ATP is washed off with the phosphate buffer.<br>
Then, the amount of the phosphorylated substrate is measured by using a liquid<br>
scintillation counter. The inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present<br>
invention represented by the aforementioned formula (l) for the Rho kinase activity<br>
can be determined by adding the compounds before starting the enzymatic reaction,<br>
and measuring suppression of the phosphorylation amount of the substrate. The<br>
phosphorylation reaction of myosin phosphatase can be measured by, for example,<br>
using an antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated myosin phosphatase<br>
(Feng, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274, pp.37385-37390, 1999). More specifically,<br>
proteins including myosin phosphatase are extracted from a tissue, subjected to<br>
electrophoresis on acrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The<br>
proteins are reacted with antibodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated myosin<br>
phosphatase to detect the amount of phosphorylated myosin phosphatase. The<br>
inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention on the phosphorylation<br>
reaction of myosin phosphatase can be determined by adding the compounds before<br>
starting the extraction from the tissue, and measuring suppression of the<br>
phosphorylation amount of the myosin phosphatase.<br>
[0102]<br>
It is considered that the compounds of the present invention represented by<br>
the aforementioned formula (l) and salts thereof inhibit the Rho/Rho kinase pathway,<br>
which is Reaction route 2 mentioned above, and exhibit potent cell contraction<br>
inhibitory activity and cell migration inhibitory activity. It is known that the<br>
83<br><br>
Rho/Rho kinase route plays an important role for cell contraction and cell migration.<br>
Other than the above, it has been reported that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway controls a<br>
variety of cellular functions such as morphological change, aggregation, release,<br>
production, division, apoptosis, and regulation of gene expression in various cell lines<br>
(Fukata, Y., et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 22, pp.32-39, 2001; Murata T.,<br>
et al., J. Hepatotol., 35, pp.474-481, 2001; Ohnaka, K., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun., 287, pp.337-342, 2001; Yuhong, S., et al., Exp. Cell Res., 278, pp.45'52,<br>
2002 ; Arakawa, Y. et al., BIO Clinica, 17(13), pp.26-28, 2002; Inoue, M. et al., Nat.<br>
Med., 10 pp.712-718, 2004). Therefore, the compounds of the present invention which<br>
inhibit the Rho/Rho kinase pathway exhibit, based on that effect, potent cell<br>
contraction inhibitory activity (for example, Test Example 2), cell morphology change<br>
regulating activity, cell migration inhibitory activity (for example, Test Example 3),<br>
cell release inhibitory activity, cell aggregation inhibitory activity, apoptosis inhibitory<br>
activity, and activity of regulating gene expression, and are useful as active<br>
ingredients of medicaments for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases<br>
relating to contraction of various cells, diseases relating to morphological change of<br>
various cells, diseases relating to migration of various cells, diseases relating to<br>
release from various cells, diseases relating to aggregation of various cells, diseases<br>
relating to apoptosis of various cells, and/or diseases relating to abnormal gene<br>
expression in various cells (Jikken Igaku (Experimental Medicine) Vol. 17, 7, 1999).<br>

Test Example l: Inhibitory action on phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain<br>
A volume of 50 to 100 ml of peripheral blood collected from healthy volunteers<br>
was centrifuged by using Mono-Poly separator solution (Dainippon Pharmaceutical) to<br>
prepare a neutrophil containing fraction. The neutrophils were washed with PBS(-)<br>
and resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS+, Gibco) to prepare a cell<br>
suspension (8 x 106/ml). The cell suspension was diluted to 5 x 106/ml, introduced into<br>
Eppendorf tubes in a volume of 0.4 ml each, then 0.1 ml each of solutions of a test<br>
compound at various concentrations were added to the suspension and allowed to react<br>
at 25°C for 5 minutes. After the reaction, 0.1 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution was<br>
added to each reaction mixture, the reaction mixture was gently shaken and<br>
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (4°C, 5 minutes), and the supernatant was removed.<br>
Subsequently, 3 M 1 of 1 M Tris solution was added to the residue, the mixture was<br>
further mixed with 50 n 1 of extraction buffer (8 M urea, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol,<br>
0.002% bromophenol blue) and left stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, the<br>
reaction mixture was loaded on a spin column (0.45 n m, Millipore) to remove the<br>
190<br><br>
insoluble solids and a sample buffer for SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25<br>
mM, Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecylsulfate, 5% sucrose,<br>
0.002% bromophenol blue as final concentrations) was added, and 10 n 1 of each<br>
sample was subjected to electrophoresis.<br>
The gel after the electrophoresis was blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane<br>
(BioRad), blocked with 5% skim milk, and reacted successively with antibodies pLCl<br>
(Sakurada K. et al, Am. J. PhysioL, 274, C1563-C1572 (1998)), which specifically<br>
recognize the phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, and donkey anti-mouse<br>
IgG (Chemicon) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The band of the<br>
phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain was detected on a film by using ECL<br>
Plus Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This band was subjected to quantification<br>
using a densitometer. By using this value, the inhibitory ratio (%) for<br>
phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain was calculated by using the<br>
following equation.<br>
Phosphorylation inhibition ratio (%) = 1 - (Band intensity of phosphorylated myosin<br>
regulatory light chain with addition of the test compound/Band intensity of<br>
phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain without addition of the test compound) x<br>
100<br>
[0314]<br>
Further, the phosphorylation inhibition ratio was calculated with changing the<br>
concentrations of the test compound, and a compound concentration providing an<br>
inhibition ratio of 50% was obtained as IC50. The results for the compounds are<br>
shown below.<br>

Test Example 2- Intraocular pressure reducing action<br>
A Japanese white rabbit having a body weight of about 2 kg was placed in a<br>
positioner and naturalized for one week before the experiment. An ophthalmologic<br>
local anesthesant (Benoxil) was administered to both eyes, and then intraocular<br>
pressure was measured by using a tonometer (Classic 30, Solan). A 3 mM aqueous<br>
solution of a test compound was administered in a volume of 50 ul to the left eye, and<br>
the right eye was not treated (control eye). The intraocular pressure values were<br>
measured for the left and right eyes immediately before, and 2, 4 and 6 hours after the<br>
administration of the aqueous solution of the test compound, and the difference of the<br>
measured values for the left and right eyes was considered an intraocular pressure<br>
reduction value of the test medicament at each measurement time. The largest<br>
difference of the values for the left and right eyes among the measured values at the<br>
measurement times (after 2, 4 and 6 hours) was considered the maximum intraocular<br>
pressure reduction value (max ZlIOP) of each test medicament. The intraocular<br>
pressure reducing degree representing the intraocular pressure reducing action of each<br>
test medicament was calculated according to the following formula. Since rabbits<br>
show significant daily variation of intraocular pressure, daily variation is added when<br>
change of intraocular pressure is measured over time, and the intraocular pressure<br>
reducing action may be overestimated. Therefore, we used this calculation method of<br>
intraocular pressure reduction value in order to minimize the influence of the<br>
variation.<br>
Intraocular pressure reducing degree (%) = (max ZllOP/Intraocular pressure value<br>
immediately before administration) x 100<br>

Test Example 3^ Neutrophil migration inhibitory action<br>
Neutrophils were isolated from 50 to 100 ml of peripheral blood collected from<br>
healthy human donors by the method described in Test Example 1 to obtain a cell<br>
suspension (8 x 106/ml). Subsequently, solutions of a test compound at various<br>
concentrations were introduced into wells of a 96-well plate in a volume of 125 fi 1 per<br>
well, the cell suspension of an equivalent volume was added to it and the plate was<br>
preincubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. During the preincubation, FMLP (l<br>
li M, Sigma) solution was added to the lower chamber to set Boyden Chamber, the<br>
preincubated cell suspension was added to the upper chamber in a volume of 200/x 1<br>
193<br><br>
per well, and the cells were allowed to migrate at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for 30<br>
minutes. The filter after the migration was collected, and the non-migrated cells<br>
adhered to the surface that faced the upper chamber were carefully wiped off. Then,<br>
the migrated cells on the back surface were stained with DifQuick dye solution<br>
(International Reagents), washed with water and dried, and then absorbance was<br>
measured at 595 nm. The inhibition ratio against migration (%) of a test compound<br>
was calculated by using the following equation^<br>
Migration inhibition ratio (%) = (1 -Absorbance of the group with addition of test<br>
compound /Absorbance of the group without addition of test compound) x 100<br>
• Further, the migration inhibitory ratio was calculated with changing the test<br>
compound concentration, and a compound concentration providing an inhibition ratio<br>
of 50% was obtained as IC50. The results for the compounds are shown below.<br>
Compounds which gave an IC50 not lower than 10 A M and not higher than 40<br>
fi M (10 /iM ^ IC50 Sa 40 p M) are the compounds of the example numbers of 1-3,<br>
1-11, 1-14, 2-1, 2-2, 8-3, 8-4, 8-5, 8-6, 8-12, 8-21, 8-26, 8-28, 8-32, 8-34, 8-37, 9-1, 10-1,<br>
11-1, 18-7, 18-8, 19-1, 19-3, 22"1, 22-2, 23-1, 26, and 27. Further compounds which<br>

40 p M) are the compounds of the example numbers of 1-6, 1"12, 1-20, 1-31, 1-38, 10-3,<br>
10-7, 19-2, 32-2, 39-1, 41-1 and 42-1. Compounds which gave an IC50 lower than 10<br>
p M (IC50 
8-2, 8-7, 8-8, 19-8, 19-40, 25-1, 29-1 and 30-1. Further compounds which gave an IC50<br>
lower than 10 p M (ICso
35"1 and 36-1. The aforementioned compounds of the present invention inhibited<br>
migration of neutrophils.<br>
Thus, it was confirmed that the compounds of the present invention were<br>
useful for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases relating to cell<br>
migration.<br>
[0317]<br>
Test Example 4: Action on increase of intracellular calcium concentration<br>
According to the method described in Test Example 1, a neutrophil containing<br>
fraction was prepared. Fura2-AM (Sigma) at a final concentration of 3 pM. was<br>
added to the human neutrophil fraction and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1<br>
hour. After centrifugation (250 g for 5 minutes), the supernatant was discarded, and<br>
194<br><br>
the neutrophils were resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS', Gibco) to<br>
prepare a cell suspension (8 x 106/ml) for measurement of intracellular calcium<br>
concentration. The cell suspension for measurement of intracellular calcium<br>
concentration was left stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, 490 n 1 of<br>
the cell suspension for measurement of intracellular calcium concentration was placed<br>
in a cuvette, 10 n 1 of calcium chloride solution at a final concentration of 1 /JM was<br>
added to it and the cuvette was set in an intracellular calcium concentration analyzer<br>
(CAF110, Nippon Bunko). fMLP (Sigma) solution at a final concentration of 1 uM<br>
was added to the cell suspension, and F340 and F380, which are fluorescence intensity<br>
at 340 nm and 380 nm, respectively, were measured to obtain an R value (F340/F380)<br>
as an index of the intracellular calcium concentration. A test compound (l n M) was<br>
added 3 minutes before the addition of fMLP, and the action on the intracellular<br>
calcium concentration was observed. The ratios of the maximum R value obtained<br>
with addition of each test compound relative to the maximum R value obtained without<br>
addition of test compound and taken as 100% were obtained.<br>
It was revealed that the compounds of the present invention had almost no<br>
effect on the increase of the intracellular calcium concentration caused by the fMLP<br>
stimulation.<br>

Test Example 5- Action on myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activity<br>
A myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was purified from chicken gizzard smooth<br>
muscle by a conventional method (Yoshida, M., et al., J. Biochem., 99, 1027-1036<br>
(1986)). The myosin regulatory light chain as a substrate was purified from the<br>
chicken gizzard smooth muscle by a conventional method (Grand, R. J., et al., Biochem.<br>
J., 211, 267-272 (1983)). The MLCK activity was measured by ELISA (Sakurada, K.,<br>
et al., J. Biochem., 115, 18-21 (1994)) using anti-phosphorylated myosin regulatory<br>
light chain-recognizing antibodies (Sakurada, K., et al., Am. J. Physiol., 274,<br>
C1563-C1572, 1998). The myosin regulatory light chain was diluted in<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) to a concentration of 5.0 g/ml, added to 96-well<br>
Immunoplate (Nunc) in a volume of 100 ix 1 per well and left stand overnight at 4°C.<br>
Each well was washed with PBS, and 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing 100 n M ATP,<br>
3 mM MgCb, 1 mM CaCl2, 100 ng/ml of calmodulin (Sigma) and 100 ng/ml of MLCK<br>
(pH 7.4, Buffer A) was added to each well and incubated at 30°C for 10 minutes. In a<br>
195<br><br>
volume of 100 p. 1 each of 20% aqueous phosphoric acid solution was added to each well<br>
to terminate the enzymatic reaction. Each well was washed with 25 mM Tris/HCl<br>
buffer (TTBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20, and then 100 n 1 of antibodies specifically<br>
recognizing phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (Sakurada, K., et al., Am. J.<br>
Physiol., 274, C1563-C1572, 1998) was added to each well and incubated at room<br>
temperature for 90 minutes.<br>
Each well was washed with TTBS, and then 100 » 1 of the HRP-labeled<br>
anti-mouse IgG antibodies (BkrRad) were added to each well and incubated at room<br>
temperature for 90 minutes. Each well was washed with TTBS, and then 25 mM<br>
citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing orthophenylenediamine (Sigma) as a substrate of<br>
HRP and aqueous hydrogen peroxide (0.03%) was added in a volume of 100 n 1 per well<br>
and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. 50 /x 1 of 4 N sulfuric acid was<br>
added to each well to terminate the reaction, and then absorbance was measured by<br>
using an immunoplate reader (Bio-Rad). The MLCK activity inhibition ratio was<br>
calculated by adding the test compound to Buffer A at various concentrations to obtain<br>
a compound concentration providing an inhibition ratio of 50% as IC50.<br>
It was revealed that the compounds of the present invention had almost no<br>
inhibitory effect on MLCK.<br>

Test Example 6^ Rabbit intraocular pressure reduction enhancing action<br>
For evaluation of intraocular pressure reduction enhancing action of a<br>
combination of the compound of the present invention and a drug for combination use,<br>
Japanese white rabbits are used as experimental animals, and the action is<br>
demonstrated as follows.<br>
As for a test example, the compound of the example number 19-1 (henceforth<br>
referred to as 19" 1 compound) was used as a test compound to demonstrate the effect of<br>
combination use. However, the effect is not limited to the 19-1 compound, and the<br>
ophthalmic solution concentration of the 19-1 compound is not limited to those used in<br>
this test example. Moreover, as for the test compound used for combination use,<br>
similar effect can be obtained also with the compounds of the present invention<br>
represented with the example numbers mentioned in Test Example 2.<br>
Test Example 6-1<br>
As a test compound, the 19" 1 compound was dissolved in physiological saline,<br>
196<br><br>
and the solution was neutralized by addition of sodium hydroxide (pH 7.0 to 8.0) to<br>
prepare a 0.01 weight % aqueous solution (19-1 compound aqueous solution). As the<br>
drugs for combination use, isopropyl unoprostone (trade name: Rescula, Santen<br>
Pharmaceutical) was used as a prostaglandin-related drug, and brinzolamide<br>
hydrochloride (trade name: Azopt, Alcon Japan) was used as a carbonic anhydrase, as<br>
the marketed formulations as they were.<br>
A Japanese white rabbit having a body weight of about 2 kg was placed in a<br>
positioner and naturalized for one week before the experiment. An ophthalmologic<br>
local anesthesant (Benoxil) was administered to both eyes, and then intraocular<br>
pressure before instillation was measured by using a tonometer (Classic 30, Solan). A<br>
test aqueous solution or the drug for combination use was administered to the left eye,<br>
and the right eye was not treated (control eye). The test groups consisted of (l)<br>
control group, (2) group instilled only with the 19" 1 compound aqueous solution (single<br>
drug group l), (3) group instilled only with the drug for combination use (single drug<br>
group 2), and (4) group instilled with the drug for combination use and the 19' 1<br>
compound aqueous solution (combination use group), and six rabbits were used for<br>
each group. As for the rabbits of these groups, 50 n L of physiological saline was first<br>
instilled to the control group, single drug group 1, and single drug group 2, and the<br>
drug for combination use was first instilled in the same volume to the combination use<br>
group. Then, 5 minutes after the instillation of physiological saline or the drug for<br>
combination use, 50 ix L of physiological saline was instilled to the control group, the<br>
same volume of the 19-1 compound aqueous solution was instilled to the single drug<br>
group 1, and the combination use group, and 50 p. L of the drug for combination use<br>
was instilled to the single drug group 2. The intraocular pressure thereafter was<br>
measured for each group 2, 4 and 6 hours after the second administration of the test<br>
compound, and the difference of the measured values for the left and right eyes at each<br>
measurement time was considered an intraocular pressure reduction value of each<br>
group. The largest difference of the intraocular pressure values for the left and right<br>
eyes among those of the measured values of the measurement times was considered<br>
the maximum intraocular pressure reduction value (max ZlIOP) of each drug group.<br>

Test Example 6-2<br>
As a test compound, the 19-1 compound was dissolved in physiological saline,<br>
and the solution was neutralized by addition of sodium hydroxide (pH 7.0 to 8.0) to<br>
prepare a 0.01 weight % aqueous solution (19-1 compound aqueous solution). As a<br>
drug for combination use, timolol maleate (trade name: Timoptol, Santen<br>
Pharmaceutical) was used as an adrenergic receptor # blocker, as the marketed<br>
formulation as it was.<br>
A Japanese white rabbit having a body weight of about 2 kg was placed in a<br>
positioner and naturalized for one week before the experiment. An ophthalmologic<br>
local anesthesant (Benoxil) was administered to both eyes, and then intraocular<br>
pressure before instillation was measured by using a tonometer (Classic 30, Solan). A<br>
test aqueous solution or the drug for combination use was administered to the left eye,<br>
and the right eye was not treated (control eye). The test groups consisted of (l)<br>
control group, (2) group instilled only with the 19-1 compound aqueous solution (single<br>
drug group l), (3) group instilled only with the drug for combination use (single drug<br>
group 2), and (4) group instilled with the drug for combination use and the 19-1<br>
198<br><br>
compound aqueous solution (combination use group), and 12 rabbits were used for each<br>
group. As for the rabbits of these groups, 50 [i L of physiological saline was first<br>
instilled to the control group, single drug group 1, and single drug group 2, and the<br>
drug for combination use was first instilled in the same volume to the combination use<br>
group. Then, 5 minutes after the instillation of physiological saline or the drug for<br>
combination use, 50 v L of physiological saline was instilled to the control group, the<br>
same volume of the 19-1 compound aqueous solution was instilled to the single drug<br>
group 1, and the combination use group, and 50 M L of the drug for combination use<br>
was instilled to the single drug group 2. The intraocular pressure thereafter was<br>
measured for each group 1, 2 and 4 hours after the second administration of the test<br>
compound, and the difference of the measured values at each measurement time for<br>
the each group and the control group was considered an intraocular pressure reduction<br>
value of each group. The largest difference of the intraocular pressure values relative<br>
to the control group among those of the measured values of the measurement times<br>
was considered the maximum intraocular pressure reduction value (max ziIOP) of<br>
each drug group. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>

In Test Examples 6-1 and 6-2, the compound of the present invention<br>
exemplified with the 19-1 compound exhibited the intraocular pressure reducing action<br>
in the single drug group 1 in a degree exceeding that of the control group, and the<br>
intraocular pressure reducing action in the combination use group in a degree<br>
exceeding those of both the single drug group 1 and single drug group 2 (Tables 2, 3,<br>
and 4).<br>
From these results, it was confirmed that intraocular pressure reducing action<br>
was enhanced in rabbits by combination of the compound of the present invention<br>
199<br><br>
exemplified with the 19-1 compound and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, a<br>
prostaglandin-related drug, or an adrenergic receptor j3 blocker. Moreover, the<br>
compounds of the example numbers 1-3, 4-1, 1O3, and 19"3 can also be evaluated by<br>
the same methods as those of Test Examples 6*1 and 6-2 to confirm the effectiveness<br>
thereof.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to confirm the effectiveness of the compounds of<br>
the present invention indicated with the example numbers mentioned in Test<br>
Examples 2 other than the 19-1 compound by performing the test using the compounds<br>
in combination with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, a prostaglandin-related drug, or<br>
an adrenergic receptor j3 blocker.<br>
Furthermore, when the compositions A to C described in Preparation Example<br>
1, the compositions E to G described in Preparation Example 2, and compositions<br>
comprising, in combination, the aforementioned example compounds and a drug for<br>
combination use were administered as the combination use group instead of<br>
successively instilling a solution of the compound of the present invention and a drug<br>
for combination use, the intraocular pressure reducing action was exhibited in the<br>
combination use group in a degree exceeding those of both the single drug group 1 and<br>
single drug group 2.<br>
Therefore, it was revealed that medicaments consisting of the compounds of<br>
the present invention and drugs for combination use were useful as medicaments for<br>
prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of glaucoma.<br>
[0320]<br>
Test Example !'• Intraocular pressure reduction enhancing action in monkey<br>
For evaluating the intraocular pressure reduction enhancing action of a<br>
combination of the compound of the present invention and latanoprost (trade name-<br>
Xalatan, Pfizer) as a prostaglandin related drug, the action can be demonstrated by<br>
using a monkey (cynomolgus monkey).<br>
Although the effect of the combination use is demonstrated by using the 19" 1<br>
compound for the test example, the effect is not limited to the 19-1 compound, and the<br>
ophthalmic solution concentration of the 19-1 compound is not limited to those used in<br>
this test example. Moreover, as for the test compound used for combination use,<br>
similar effect can be obtained also with the compounds of the present invention<br>
represented with the example numbers mentioned in Test Example 2. The test is<br>
200<br><br>
performed by using cynomolgus monkeys sufficiently naturalized for the operation of<br>
fixation on a monkey chair and ophathalmotonometry.<br>
As the test compound, Compound A is dissolved in physiological saline, and the<br>
solution is neutralized by addition of sodium hydroxide (pH 7.0 to 8.0) to prepare a<br>
0.01 weight % aqueous solution (19-1 compound aqueous solution). As a drug for<br>
combination use, latanoprost (trade name- Xalatan, Pfizer) is used as the marketed<br>
formulation per se. The test aqueous solution or the drug for combination use is<br>
instilled to the left eye, and the right eye is not treated (control eye). The test groups<br>
consist of (l) control group, (2) group instilled only with the 19-1 compound aqueous<br>
solution (single drug group 1), (3) group instilled only with the drug for combination<br>
use (single drug group 2), and (4) group instilled with the drug for combination use and<br>
the 19-1 compound aqueous solution (combination use group). After initial<br>
intraocular pressure values of the monkeys are measured for each group, 30 ii L of<br>
physiological saline is instilled to the control group, single drug group 1, and single<br>
drug group 2, and latanoprost is instilled in the same volume to the combination use<br>
group. Then, 5 minutes after the instillation of physiological saline or latanoprost, 30<br>
li L of physiological saline is instilled to the control group, the same volume of the 191<br>
compound aqueous solution is instilled to the single drug group 1, and the combination<br>
use group, and 30 v L of the drug for combination use is instilled to the single drug<br>
group 2. Then, the intraocular pressure is measured over time for each group.<br>
In Test Example 7, the 19-1 compound exhibits the intraocular pressure<br>
reducing action in the single drug group 1 in a degree exceeding that of the control<br>
group, and the intraocular pressure reducing action in the combination use group in a<br>
degree exceeding those of both the single drug group 1 and single drug group 2. It is<br>
thereby confirmed that the intraocular pressure reducing action is enhanced in<br>
monkeys by combining the compound of the present invention and a<br>
prostaglandin-related drug. Moreover, the compounds of the example numbers 1-3,<br>
4-1, 10-3, and 19-3 can also be evaluated by the same method as that of Test Example 7<br>
to confirm the effectiveness thereof.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to confirm the effectiveness of the compounds of<br>
the present invention indicated with the example numbers mentioned in Test<br>
Examples 2 other than the 19-1 compound by performing the test using the compounds<br>
in combination with a prostaglandin-related drug.<br>
201<br><br>
Furthermore, when the composition D described in Preparation Example 1,<br>
the composition H described in Preparation Example 2, and compositions comprising<br>
the aforementioned example compounds and latanoprost in combination are<br>
administered as the combination use group instead of successively instilling a solution<br>
of the compound of the present invention and latanoprost, the intraocular pressure<br>
reducing action is exhibited in the combination use group in a degree exceeding those<br>
of both the single drug group 1 and single drug group 2.<br>
Therefore, it is revealed that medicaments consisting of the compounds of the<br>
present invention and latanoprost are useful as medicaments for prophylactic and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment of glaucoma.<br>
