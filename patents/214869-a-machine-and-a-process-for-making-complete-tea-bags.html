				<td>The present invention relates to a machine and a process for making complete tea bags.<br>
The present invention relates to a machine for making tea bags for infusion in liquid.<br>
The invention relates in particular to a tea bag making machine which uses a process whereby an infusible product, in loose form, is measured ad fed into a filter bag consisting of folded sheets of porous material, heat-sealed to each other and equipped with a thread for holding the filter bag during infusion. The machine relates in particular to the making of filter bags containing tea or chamomile without thereby restricting the scope of the disclosure but including also herbs and any other products capable of being infused in a liquid.<br>
In the tea and chamomile filter bag sector, it is very important that the thread be fastened to the filter bag every securely to prevent it form coming loose when the filter bag is immersed in the infusion liquid.<br>
Indeed, stirring and agitating the tea bag during infusion, for example with a teaspoon, in order to speed up the infusion process is such a widespread tendency that tea bag manufacturers in some countries must conform with technical standards that specify- a minimum limit of resistance to detachment of the filter bag from the thread, below which filter bags are considered unacceptable because they cannot provide consumers with a sufficient guarantee of not coming loose during infusion.<br>
In the case of filter bags made by heat-sealing, one known solution envisages the formation of a small portion of loop with one end of the thread, the  portion  of  loop  being  held  between  the overlaid, heat-sealed edge flaps of the sheets of porous material and fixed to them by two short sections impregnated with the adhesive with which the edge flaps are heat-sealed to each other. This solution,  although simple  in construction, does not provide a sufficient guarantee of meeting the minimum requirement of resistance to detachment enabling the thread to remain securely fixed to the filter bag during infusion. The present invention has for an object to provide<br>
a machine for making tea bags capable of solving the problem mentioned above.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a machine for making complete tea bags comprising a filter bag containing infusable product for infusion in a liquid and formed of sheets of porous material, sealed together along their margins to form sealed edges of the filter bag, and comprising also a thread used for holding the filter bag during infusion, the machine being characterized in that it comprises:<br>
-	a wheel that rotates about its axis and that has a lateral surface<br>
equipped with pins housed inside radial cavities in the wheel, the said pins<br>
being driven by appropriate actuating means from a rest position where<br>
they are retracted completely into the cavities in the lateral surface to a<br>
working position where instead  they protrude from  the lateral surface<br>
outwards from the wheel;<br>
-	means for feeding a continuous strip of porous material wound<br>
round the lateral surface of the wheel and moving in a lengthways direction<br>
of feed;<br>
-	means for feeding a continuous thread to a distributor nozzle<br>
mounted close to the lateral surface of the wheel and driven by actuating<br>
Q+*~'<br>
means in such a way as to lay the thread^^a the strip round the pins following a continuous path that includes ?r succession of closed loops placed at regular intervals, each loop having two mutually intersecting, lengthways and crossways sections, a first lengthways section of which is released close to the first margin of the strip and the second crossways section being instead arranged in such a way that it crosses the first margin, the said path also including a portion of loop of thread that protrudes from the said first margin<br>
-	means for holding against the strip at least one second lengthways<br>
section of thread that is further away from the first margin than the first<br>
lengthways section;<br>
-	means for depositing a succession of charges of infusable product<br>
on the strip of porous material, on top of the loops of thread;<br>
-	means for folding a second margin of the strip over the first margin<br>
to form a tubular receptacle that gradually closes  over the charges of<br>
infusable product until the margins of the strip are laid over one another;<br>
-	sealing means acting on the lengthways margins of the tubular<br>
receptacle and crossways along lines in order to form the tubular receptacle<br>
into a series of closed filter bags;<br>
-	means for cutting the tubular receptacle at regular intervals so as to<br>
separate the filter bags.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a process for making complete tea bags using the machine, said process comprising :<br>
-	feeding a continuous strip of porous material along a lengthways<br>
direction of feed;<br>
-	laying on the strip of the thread following a continuous path having<br>
a series of closed loops at regular intervals, each loop having two mutually<br>
intersecting, lengthways and crossways sections, a first lengthways section<br>
of which is released close to a first margin of the  strip, and a second<br>
crossways section which is instead arranged in such a way that it crosses<br>
the first margin, the said path having a portion of loop of thread protruding<br>
from the first margin;<br>
-	holding at least one second thread lengthways section against the<br>
strip of porous material, the said section being located further away from<br>
the first margin than the first lengthways section;<br>
-	depositing a succession of charges of infusable product on top of the<br>
loops of thread on the strip of porous material;<br>
-	folding of the second margin of the strip over the first margin to form<br>
a tubular receptacle that gradually closes over the charges of product until<br>
the margins of the strip are laid over each other;<br>
-	sealing the tubular receptacle lengthways along the margins and<br>
crossways along the lines to form the tubular receptacle into sealed filter<br>
bags;<br>
-	cutting the tubular receptacle at regular intervals to separate the<br>
filter bags.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a complete tea bag produced by a process comprising a filter bag containing a charge of product for infusion in a liquid and formed of sheets of porous material sealed together along their margins to form edges that seal the filter bag, and comprising also a thread for holding the filter bag during infusion, the tea bag being characterized in that the thread has sections which cross the edges of the filter bag intersecting to form a closed loop, a first part of which is located inside the filter bag and a second part being instead located between the sealed margins of the same edge of the filter bag, the said thread being arranged in the filter bag in such a way that when just one of the sections of thread is pulled, the thread slides through the edge of the filter bag so as to shorten the first section of the loop, tightening it against the edge of the filter bag and creating a particularly resistant fastening of the thread on the filter bag during infusion.<br>
The arrangement of the thread inside the filter bag is such that when either of the sections of thread is pulled, the thread runs through the edge, thus reducing the length of the first section of the loop and tightening it to form a knot against the edge in such a way as to keep the filter bag securely fastened to the thread during infusion.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the automatic machine made in accordance with the invention envisages an arrangement of the thread such that a tag for<br>
holding the tea bag can also be attached by heat-sealing, the tags being fed to the wheel by an appropriate intermittent feeder synchronized with the wheel itself.<br>
The special arrangement of the thread in order to fasten it securely to the filter bag allows the entire tea bag making process to be carried out while keeping practically the entire length of the thread (corresponding to the section necessary to form the fastening that holds it to the bag during infusion) inside the filter bag.<br>
This makes it possible for the filter bags to be moved along the machine with relative ease without the need for the complex mechanical assemblies normally required by automatic machines to handle a loose, shapeless element as is the thread. Consequently, the machine made according to the invention is relatively simple in construction and economical.<br>
Moreover, the machine made according to the invention, although it makes known types of filter bags that are heat-sealed on three sides, is structured in such a way as to allow the infusable product to be fed into the bags during the forming process by means of rotary-type feeders.<br><br>
Compared with known machines, which are designed to make similar products and which are equipped with gravity feeders, the machine made according to the invention works much faster an has a markedly higher output per hour.<br>
The working speed, which is completely unrelated to height because it is not a gravity feed system, may also be adjusted according to requirements and is limited only by the setting time of the adhesives used for heat-sealing the edges of the bag. The present invention also discloses a process comprising the following steps:<br>
-	feeding a continuous strip of porous material<br>
along a lengthways direction of feed;<br>
-	laying on the strip of a thread following a<br>
continuous path including a series of closed loops<br>
at regular intervals, each loop having two mutually<br>
intersecting sections, a first lengthways section<br>
of which is released close to a first margin of the<br>
strip,  and  a  second  crossways  section  being,<br>
instead, arranged in such a way that it crosses the<br>
first margin, and, while the thread is being laid<br>
in this way, a portion of a loop of thread is also<br>
formed which protrudes from the first margin of the<br>
strip and whose ends are connected, respectively,<br><br>
to the crossways section of a first loop and to the lengthways section of a second loop adjacent to it;<br>
-	holding against the strip of at least a second<br>
lengthways section of the loop of thread located<br>
further away from the first margin than the first<br>
lengthways section;<br>
-	depositing on top of the loops on the strip a<br>
succession of charges of infusable product;<br>
-	folding a second margin of the strip over the<br>
first margin to make a tubular receptacle that<br>
closes over the charges of product;<br>
-	lengthways   and   crossways   sealing   of   the<br>
receptacle  to  form a  continuous  succession of<br>
filter bags sealed on three sides;<br>
-	cutting  the  tubular  receptacle  at  regular<br>
intervals.<br>

With reference to Fig. 1, the numeral 90 indicates as a whole a machine for making a complete tea bag 91 illustrated in detail in Fig. 10.<br>
The tea bag 91 comprises a filter bag 1 containing a charge of infusable product for infusion in a liquid and is formed of sheets of porous material 2 and 3, preferably filter paper, folded and sealed along three margins 4 to form sealed edges 5 of the filter bag 1.<br>
The tea bag 91 also comprises a thread 6 used for holding the filter bag 1 during infusion and fastened to the upper edge 5 of the filter bag 1 and to a tag 13 used for picking up the filter bag 1 itself.<br>
Fig. 10 also shows that the thread 6 has sections 7 and 8, arranged lengthways and crossways, respectively, in relation to the upper edge 5 and intersecting each other to form a closed loop 9. A first section 10 of the closed loop 9 is located inside the filter bag 1, between the sheets 2 and 3<br>
of porous material. A second section 11, on the other hand, is located between the margins 4, which are sealed to each other to form the upper edge 5 of the filter bag 1.<br>
On the outside of the filter bag 1, the thread 6 is fastened to the upper edge 5 in such a way as to form a protruding portion of loop 12, to which the pickup tag 13 is fixed.<br>
The portion of loop 12 allows the pickup tag 13 to hang loosely from the filter bag 1.<br>
The lengthways and crossways sections 7 and 8 of the thread are impregnated in the adhesive used to form the edge 5. The lengthways section 7, the longer one, is more slip resistant than the crossways section 8, which is shorter (see Fig. 11) when the thread 6 is pulled from the outside of the filter bag 1. Hence, under the pulling action, the crossways section 8 of the thread 6 slides outwards in such a way as to shorten the first section 10 of the loop 9, tightening it against the edge 5 of the filter bag 1 and creating a particularly resistant fastening of the thread 6 on the filter bag 1. With reference to Fig. 1 again, it may be observed that the tea-bag making machine 90 basically consists of a central section 95 around which there<br>
is mounted a plurality of work heads that interact with it.<br>
The central section 95 (see Figs. 2a, 2b and 3) comprises in particular a wheel 29 that has an internal cavity 69 and that rotates continuously about its geometric axis 30, the said wheel being made in two cylindrical, coaxial halves 34 and 35 adjacent to each other along the axis of rotation 30, and together defining a cylindrical lateral surface 31.<br>
The lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29 is equipped with pins 25 housed inside radial cavities 32 in the wheel 29, intercommunicating with the internal cavity 69.<br>
The pins 25, driven by appropriate actuating means, move from a rest position, where they are retracted completely into the cavities 32 in the lateral surface 31, to a working position where, instead, they protrude from the latter outwards from the wheel 29.<br>
The actuating means that drive the pins 25 comprise a cam 70, housed and rotating in the cavity 69 in the wheel 29, which acts on the ends of the pins 25 in such a way as to push them out of, or make them retract into, the radial cavities 32 in accordance<br>
with the different steps in the process cycle of the machine 90.<br>
Round the periphery of the rotating wheel 29, the machine 90 envisages the following:<br>
-	means 36,  37 and 38 for feeding a continuous<br>
strip of porous material 14;<br>
-	means 64, 66 and 67 for feeding the tags 13 used<br>
for picking up the filter bag 1;<br>
-	means 71 for feeding the thread 6;<br>
-	means 47, 47' and 48 for holding the thread 6<br>
against the strip of porous material 14;<br>
-	means 49 and 50 for feeding charges of infusable<br>
product;<br>
-	means 52,  54,  55,  59;  552,  592 and 594  for<br>
folding the strip of porous material 14;<br>
-	sealing means 61 and 62; and lastly<br>
-	cutting means 63.<br>
The means for feeding the strip of porous material 14 consist of a roll 36 on which the continuous strip of porous material 14 is wound, a series of feed rollers 37 and a sensor 38 which controls the tension of the strip 14;<br>
The latter unwinds from the roll 36 and is fed to the first half 34 of the wheel 29 following a feed path defined by the feed rollers 37 .<br>
After being wound round the lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29, the strip 14 advances along the machine 90 following a lengthways feed direction 15 which conveys it towards an outfeed section 92 of the machine 90, as will be described in more detail below.<br>
The sensor 38 includes a counterweight roller 72 related to the strip of paper 14 and mounted on the end of a tensioner arm 73 connected with a variable speed motor 74, the latter being controlled by the position of the arm 73 in such a way as to keep the feed rate of the strip 14 along the machine constant.<br>
The means that feed the tags 13 used for picking up the filter bag 1 include: a roll 64 of pickup tags 13 in the form of a continuous strip 65, made of heat-sealable material and a strip 65 unwinding unit 66 equipped with a rotary knife 67 mounted peripherally in relation to the wheel 29. The strip 65 is fed to the wheel 29 and, moving in synchrony with the latter, is positioned at the second half 35 of the wheel 29, close to a first margin 16 of the strip 14, where it is held in place by appropriate holding means consisting preferably of suction cups 68 mounted on the second<br>
half 35 of the wheel 29.<br>
The rotary knife 67, whose peripheral speed is greater than the speed of rotation of the wheel 29, cuts the strip of pickup tags 13 at regular intervals, causing the tags to move along the wheel 29 at a tangent until they are stopped by a pair of pins 25 (see Fig. 4) on the second half 35 which protrude from the lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29. The single pickup tags 13 are thus placed intermittently at preset intervals on the lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29 and along a lengthways direction of feed 15.<br>
The thread 6 feeding means send the thread 6 to a distributor nozzle 26 (see Fig. 2b) . The latter is mounted close to the lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29 and is driven by actuating means 39, 43 and 45 in such a way as to lay the thread 6 on the strip of porous material 14, round the pins 25, following a path 21 that includes a succession of closed loops 9 shaped as described above in connection with the arrangement of the thread 6 in the filter bag 1, illustrated in Figs. 4 and 10. The actuating means acting on the nozzle 26 (see Fig. 3) consist of the following parts: a right-angled lever 39 mounting the distributor nozzle 26<br>
at one end 40 and having an actuating end 41 and an intermediate joint 42; a first arm 43 coaxial with the wheel 29, mounted in such a way that it can rotate about its axis of symmetry 30 and mounting a cam-operated actuator 44 connected to the actuating end 41 of the•right-angled lever 39; and, lastly, a second arm 45, also coaxial with the wheel 29 and mounting a pivot 46 for the intermediate joint of the right-angled lever 39.<br>
The first and second arms 43 and 45 are motor-driven in such a way as to swing relative to each other and relative to the wheel 29 so as to swing the nozzle 26 accordingly in such a manner as to allow it to describe the said path 21 round the pins 25 remaining constantly at the same distance from the lateral surface 31 of the wheel 29. The means which hold the thread 6 against the strip of porous material 14 include a hot air heater 47 (see Figs.2a, 2b and 3) mounted peripherally in relation to the wheel 29 and placed at a convenient distance from the first margin 16 of the strip 14, measured according to the axis of rotation 30 of the wheel 29. The activation of the heater 47 causes spots of adhesive on the strip of porous aterial 14 to melt at the first and second<br>
lengthways sections 7 and 28 of the loops 9 of the thread 6.<br>
The holding means include a pressure element 48 designed to press the thread 6 onto the strip of porous material 14, using the wheel 29 as contact surface, so as to make the thread adhere to the strip 14 after the adhesive has melted. Similar heating means 78 (see Figs. 2a, 2b) are envisaged, preferably just upstream of the wheel 29, in relation to the counterclockwise direction of rotation, to act in the same way on the filter bag 1 pickup tag 13 to heat seal it to the loop 12 of the thread 6 that protrudes from the first margin 16 of the strip 14.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3 or 4, it can be seen that the pickup tag 13 moves forward together with the wheel 29, is engaged on the side 76 opposite the side 77 where the thread 6 is by a helical path 75 (illustrated schematically) or by similar equivalent means which gradually fold it onto itself but without bringing the sides 76 and 77 into contact with each other.<br>
When the heating means 78 are activated, a jet of hot air is blown onto the facing surfaces of the sides 76 and 77, so as to melt the adhesive which<br><br>
the pickup tag 13 also has on it.<br>
When the pickup tag 13 and the strip of porous<br>
material  14  reach  the  abovementioned  pressure<br>
element 48,  the latter also presses against the<br>
pickup tag 13, which is thus definitively connected<br>
to the portion of loop 12 of the thread 6.<br>
Another  embodiment  of  the  heating  means  is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13. This figure shows that a<br>
single  heater  47',  supplied by hot  air,  also<br>
includes the heating means 78 acting in the same<br>
way as described above on the tags 13 used for<br>
picking the filter bag 1.<br>
In particular, Fig. 13 shows that the single heater<br>
47' has sets of holes 21, 202 and 203 through which<br>
jets of hot air are directed at the strip of porous<br>
material 14.<br>
Two sets of holes 201 and 202 are arranged along a<br>
line parallel to the axis 30 of the wheel 29 and<br>
direct the hot air flow at the first and second<br>
lengthways sections 7 and 28 of the thread 6 in<br>
such a way as to melt the adhesive material.<br>
The third set of holes 203 extends along a curved<br>
edge of the heater 47 ' opposite a circular arc of<br>
the wheel 29 in such a way as to interact with the<br>
opposing surfaces 76 and 77 of the pickup tags 13<br>
during folding and to melt the adhesive on in the same way as envisaged for the heating means 78 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The means which feed charges of infusable product (see Figs. 1 and 2a) include a rotor 49 connected with a container 50 with infusable product in loose form in it.<br>
The rotor 49 has feed cavities 51 located at regular intervals round its outer surface. Since the strip 14 can move at a tangent to the rotor 49 at a speed identical to the peripheral speed of the rotor, the charges of product 19 in the individual cavities 51, during the rotation of the rotor 49 are placed on top of the loops 9 of thread 6 on the strip 14 at regular intervals along the lengthways direction of feed 15.<br>
Connected with the feed means 49 and 50, the tea bag making machine 90 also comprises the abovementioned means 52, 54, 55 and 59 for folding the strip of porous material 14 (a first preferred embodiment of which is illustrated in Figs. 5,6,7 and 8).<br>
These folding means, in particular include a first flat folding element 52, a contact surface 54, a pressure foot 55 and a second flat folding element<br>
59.<br>
The first flat folding element 52 is located on the side of the feeder means 49 and 50 and over the strip of porous material 14. Also, one of its edges 53 is angled in relation to the second margin 18 of the strip of porous material 14, opposite the first margin 16.<br>
The contact surface 54 of the strip of porous material 14 is horizontal but at an angle to the plane in which the first flat folding element 52 lies .<br>
The front 56 of the pressure foot 55 interacts with the contact surface 54 in such a way as to press the strip 14 against it. It also has a back 58 which, together with the front 56, defines an edge 57 that intersects the edge 53 of the first flat folding element 52 so that together they define a triangular flap 17 on the second margin 18 of the strip 14.<br>
The second flat folding element 59 moves in parallel and at right angles to the strip 14 and is equipped with a strip 14 pressure roller 60 which, acting in combination with the back 58, enables the second margin 18 of the strip 14 to be gradually folded and laid over the first margin 16.<br>
Working in the manner described above, the folding means fold the strip 14 to form a tubular receptacle 20 which gradually closes over the charges of infusable product 19 deposited on the strip 14 itself.<br>
An alternative, constructionally very simple, embodiment of the folding means is illustrated in Fig. 12. As shown in this figure, the aforesaid folding means consist basically of a pressure foot 551, a folding element 591 and a stop finger 594 interacting with each other to form the said tubular receptacle 20.<br>
The pressure foot 551 is fixed to the machine structure and mounts a first elongated element 552 which is placed over the strip of porous material 14 lengthways with respect to the said strip 14. The folding element 591 in turn mounts a second elongated element 592 which is placed crossways over the strip of porous material 14 and oriented at an angle to the first elongated element 552 in such a way that its furthest end is closer to the first margin 16 of the strip 14.<br>
The finger 594 is mounted further upstream, along the strip 14 direction of feed 15. One of the margins 18 of the strip of porous<br>
material 14 winds once round the first folding element 552 and then, passing between the first and second folding elements 552 and 592, a second time round the second folding elment 592, in the opposite direction, so as to form a flap 17 stopped at the back by the finger 594.<br>
The flap 17 formed in this way allows the charges of infusable product to be deposited on the underlying sheet 2, which is not folded, and to form the tubular receptacle 20 as the strip 14 moves along the direction of feed 15. Downstream of the folding means, proceeding in the lengthways direction of feed 15, the machine 90 envisages the abovementioned sealing means. The latter, by means of a pair of counter-rotating rollers 61 and 62 located on each side of the tubular receptacle 20, seal the overlaid margins 16 and 18 of the strip 14 lengthways and, at the same time, seal the tubular receptacle 20 crossways at regular intervals to form a succession of filter bags 1 along the receptacle 20.<br>
The cutting means 63 then cut the tubular receptacle 20 in synchrony, thus separating the filter bags 1 from one another and sending them to the outfeed section 92 of the machine 90.<br>
The operation of the machine 90 will now be described with reference to the tea bag making process illustrated schematically in Fig. 9, with sections labelled A, B and C.<br>
With reference to Fig. 9-A, it can be observed that the process comprises the following steps:<br>
-	feeding a continuous strip of porous material 14<br>
along a lengthways direction of feed 15;<br>
-	intermittent,  synchronized feeding of  tags  13<br>

-	gradually folding the pickup tag 13 onto itself<br>
against the helical track 75,  starting with the<br>
flaps 24 of the pickup tag 13 co-planar and ending<br>
with the flaps overlaid on either side of the<br>
portion of loop 12;<br>
-	holding the thread 6 loop 9 first and second<br>
lengthways sections 7 and 28 against the strip 14,<br>
the  said  sections  being  located,  respectively,<br>
