Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Reference now will be made to the embodiments of the invention, one or<br>
more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way<br>
of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. In fact, it will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations<br>
can be made in this invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention is directed to UV absorbing compounds that can be used in<br>
a wide variety of compositions or end products to provide to a coating, substrate,<br>
or resin a UV resistant property. Ultraviolet light degrades many substances,<br>
and thus a composition that can be used to avoid such undesirable degradation<br>
is highly desirable.<br>
Benzotriazole derivatives set forth herein are in general reactive,<br>
liquid, and are polymeric-bearing amide functioning oxyalkylene and aliphatic<br>
ester block copolymer/oligomer chain(s). The inventive UV absorbers set forth<br>
herein typically are liquid and polymeric, but it is not required that they be liquid,<br>
or polymeric.<br>
The inventive UV absorbers, in one particular embodiment, bear primary<br>
OH group(s) at the end of the respective polymer chain(s). They may be<br>
completely reactive in polyurethane, PET and polycarbonate (PC) applications,<br>
for example. One advantage of the invention is that the inventive UV absorbers<br>
tend to resist extraction, migration, fogging, and leaching. Furthermore, they<br>
may provide longer performance lifetimes than conventional UV absorbers in<br>
many applications.<br>
The inventive UV absorbers may bear oxyalkylene (hydrophilic) and<br>
aliphatic ester (hydrophobia) functions, thus usually these compositions are<br>
adjustable within the combination to provide compatibility for various media.<br>

may offer a very good solution to stabilize polyurethane from NOX gas fading,<br>
which is highly desirable.<br>

Upon mixture within a reaction vessel, the reaction created a "health"<br>
bubble (indicating gelation and blowing, balance), and the vessel was then<br>
1A<br>
exposed to 185 °C (generated within a microwave oven to simulate actual heat<br>
history encountered on an industrial production environment) for about 10 min to<br>
form a foam bun. The resultant foam buns were then analyzed for performance,<br>
as discussed in details below.<br>
b) Performance Characteristics of Polvether Foams Including Inventive UV<br>
Absorbers<br>
The white foams made in accordance with formulation and process as<br>
described in Section a), were all tested for standard foam performance, in terms<br>
of rise time, tack time, and bun height, and compared with the control polyether<br>
foams either made with existing commercial UV absorbers or made without<br>
additive. Measurements within 5% of the control are considered acceptable for<br>
the finished foam product. The measurements are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Foam Performance of Inventive or Comparative UV Absorbers<br>
Sample<br>
Additionally, the foams produced exhibited good resiliency and densities<br>
measured at about 1.5 pounds per cubit foot. Thus, the inventive UV absorbers<br>
provide acceptable polyurethane foam articles as compared with control<br>
samples.<br>
c) Extraction Measurements From Polvurethane Foams<br>
The polyurethane foams produced in above section b) were analyzed for<br>
extraction levels using the following method. The extraction test involved cutting<br>
1 gram of the cured foam from the center of the sample and post-curing the cut<br>
foam for another 20 minutes at 160°C in a glass jar. After cooling to room<br>
temperature, 75 grams of methanol were then added to the glass jar that was<br>
then capped for 1 hour. The foam was then removed and the extract solution<br>
was analyzed under Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer for the<br>
maximum absorption. If the solution is too concentrate, dilute it with methanol to<br>
20%, then measure its UV-vis and calculate the absorption value of the original<br>
solution. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br>
Table 2. Foam Extraction Tests of<br>
Inventive or Comparative UV Absorbers<br>
Based on the molecular weight of these additives, 1.5 php of Tinuvin 326<br>
is mole equivalent to 3.0 php of Tinuvin 1130, 3.8 php of inventive Example 9,<br>
and 3.6 php of inventive Example 11. As suggested from Table 2, the inventive<br>
27<br>
liquid polymeric UV absorbers provide significant improvement in the foam<br>
extraction test, comparing to comparative examples such as commercial<br>
products Tinuvin 326 and Tinuvin 1130,<br>
d) Protection of Colorants from UV Discoloration in Polvurethane Foam<br>
Liquid polymeric colorant ReacTint® Blue X3LV (available from Milliken<br>
Chemical) is widely used for the coloration of polyurethane foam, and is known<br>
to be very prone to UV discoloration. Thus, the blue foams were made in the<br>
presence of 1php Blue X3LV with or without inventive UV absorber, in<br>
accordance with formulation and process as described in Section a). The foam<br>
buns were sliced in half, and small pieces of foam samples (diameters of 10cm x<br>
5cm x 2cm) were cut from the center of each foam bun. These foam samples<br>
were all tested under Xenon lamp chamber (AATCC Test No. 16-1999) for<br>
discoloration at different exposure time. Those foam samples exposed different<br>
amount of time under Xenon light were then compared reading in CMC for delta<br>
E with respected unexposed foam samples. The results are summarized in<br>
Table 3. Stabilization of RTBlurX3LV with Inventive UVAbsorbers<br>
Thus, without UV absorber, Blue X3LV was completely discolored after 1<br>
hour of exposure under Xenon light. However, the discoloration of Blue X3LV<br>
foam made in the presence of the inventive UV absorber (1 php) from Example 9<br>
showed significant improvement as evidenced in delta E measurement.<br>
e) Reduction of Discoloration in White Polvurethane Foam<br>
Several white foams made in accordance with formulation and process as<br>
described in Section a), in the presence of unique anti-discoloration additive<br>
packages consists of a UV absorber selected from Class A, a phenolic<br>
antloxidant from Class B, a secondary amine antioxidant from Class C and a<br>
lactone antioxidant from Class D. The inventive liquid polymeric UV absorbers<br>
are used in this unique additive package to replace the commercial UV<br>
absorbers which are solid and/or non-reactive. Upon the foams are made with<br>
the inventive additive packages, as well as commercially available additive<br>
packages, the foam buns are then sliced in half, and compared the performance<br>
against UV discoloration (Xenon lamp test according to AATCC Test No. 16-<br>
1999) and gas fading (AATCC Test No. 23-1999).<br>
The inventive synergistic additive composition packages are listed in Table<br>
4. Also included in Table 4 as comparatives, are control (with no additive) and<br>
commercially available additive packages B-75 (Ciba), CS-31 (Crompton) and<br>
LS-1 (Ortegol), which are current best commercial products in polyurethane<br>
industry for stabilization of white polyurethane foams.<br>

Lightfastness and gas fade test results for the inventive and comparative<br>
sample foams are summarized in Table 5.<br>
Table 5. Test Results for Inventive and Comparative Additive Packages<br>
Clearly, the inventive additive packages containing the inventive liquid<br>
polymeric UV absorbers exhibited the best overall performance against<br>
discoloration of UV exposure and gas fade, comparing to state-of-the-art<br>
commercial additive packages such as GG, HH and JJ. More over, when used at<br>
equal mole loading (based on different molecular weights of respected UV<br>
absorbers), the additive package containing the inventive liquid reactive<br>
polymeric UV absorber has significantly better performance than that containing<br>
solid non-reactive commercial UV absorber such as Tinuvin 326; especially<br>
when exposed to NOX gas discoloration tests.<br>
f) Application of the Inventive UV absorbers in PET Packaging<br>
UV absorbers are being increasingly used in PET packaging to protect the<br>
content from UV degradation in the food container industry. Since UV absorbers<br>
could decompose during the injection molding process at process condition<br>
(usually 280 °C) causing resin yellowing, the appearance (yellowness index) the<br>
final PET articles (containing UV absorbers) becomes an indicator for the<br>
suitability of UV absorbers in this application. Another requirement for an<br>
acceptable UV absorber is the lightfastness of the UV absorber itself. The<br>
inventive liquid polymeric UV absorbers were thus tested for their performance<br>
against current best commercial products ClearShiald® UV absorbers (available<br>
from Milliken Chemical).<br>
In each instance noted below regarding polyester article production<br>
applications, the inventive polymeric UV absorber was introduced within an<br>
injection molding operation for a polyester thermoplastic, in this instance<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (ClearTuf® 8006 PET resin from M&amp;G). The inventive<br>
UV absorber, in the amount noted in the related examples below, was blended<br>
via agitation onto hot, dried PET resin pellets. The blend of UV absorber and<br>
pellets was gravity fed into the feed throat of the machine. In the feed section,<br>
melting was accomplished through the utilization of rotating heated (heat<br>
transferred from the barrel of the machine) screw extruder. The rotation of the<br>
screw provided thorough mixing of the UV absorber and molten resin together<br>
producing a uniform plastic melt which was injected into a mold in order to form<br>
the thermoplastic article, in this instance a 2 inch by 3 inch plaque with a uniform<br>
thickness of 50 mils and a surface area of 12.5 in2.<br>
Ten 50 mil-thick plaques of UV absorber-containing PET, as made above,<br>
thermoplastic plaques of polyester terephthalate containing inventive UV<br>
absorber were produced as described above (injection molded) were collected.<br>
The same injection molding machine used to produce these first ten plaques was<br>
paused during production of ten further plaques and allowed to remain idle for 15<br>
minutes at the standard polyester processing temperatures (~277°C). At the end<br>
of the 15-minute pause, the machine was then restarted without purging the<br>
colored resin from the heated barrel of the machine. Ten consecutive plaques<br>
were then collected and numbered after resumption of the injection molding<br>
operation.<br>
The absorbance at the UV absorber lambda max of the Control Samples<br>
collected from the standard operation was measured by Perkin-Elmer Lambda<br>
35 Spectrophotometer and averaged together to represent a standard<br>
measurement for all plaques. Each of the ten consecutive Measured Sample<br>
plaques collected after the 15-minute hold-period was measured individually and<br>
sequentially on the spectrophotometer. The absorbance difference between the<br>
standard measurements for the Control Samples each of the ten Measured<br>
Sample plaques was recorded and defined as the change in absorbance (AAbs).<br>
The thermal stability of UV absorber was measured by the percentage of UV<br>
absorbance loss (Loss%), as calculated by the formula<br>
Loss% = [Mbs] I [standard]<br>
The biggest Loss% of the ten Measured Samples plaques collected after<br>
the 15-minute hold period represents the largest absorbance difference, and is<br>
determined to be the UV absorber's thermal stability.<br>
The thermal stability (Loss%) of the inventive UV absorbers from Example<br>
9, above, as well as comparative commercial UV absorbers (ClearShield® UV<br>
absorbers) were measured, and the results are tabulated in Table 6 (the<br>
loadings for UV absorbers were adjusted to the same heights of the absorption<br>
peaks based on their Color Values).<br><br>
A Loss% of less than 10 Is considered to be acceptable, with a result less than 2<br>
considered to be outstanding when analyzed by this protocol. Clearly, the inventive UV<br>
absorbers exhibited highly favorable thermal stability characteristics with no detectable loss,<br>
particularly in comparison with current best commercial products.<br>
For each individual inventive or comparative UV absorber compositions at<br>
specified loadings (below), ten 50mil-thick plaques were made according to<br>
process described as above in the previous section.<br>
The absorbance (at each UV absorber's lambda max) of the ten plaques<br>
collected from the standard operation was measured in Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35<br>
Spectrophotometer and averaged together to represent the Standard<br>
Measurement. Three sets of 2 plaques were then placed under xenon light for<br>
20 and 40 hours exposure, respectively. Each set of the 2 plaques was<br>
collected after the elapsed times of exposure and were measured for change in<br>
absorbance (at each UV absorber's lambda max) individually and sequentially<br>
on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrophotometer. The absorbance difference between the<br>
Standard Measurement and each of the 2 sets of plaques exposed was<br>
determined as AAbs. The lightfastness of the UV absorber incorporated was<br>
thus measured by the percentage of UV absorbance loss (Loss%), as calculated<br>
by the formula<br>
Loss% = [AAbs] /[Standard]<br>
The greater the Loss% of the plaques, the larger the absorbance<br>
difference and is determined to be worse the UV absorber's lightfastness. The<br>
test results are summarized in Table 7.<br>
TABLE 7. Lightfastness of the Inventive and Comparative UV Absorbers<br>
Under this protocol, a Loss%of at most 15% after 40 hours exposure is<br>
highly desired. This shows that the Inventive UV absorber provides significantly<br>
improved lightfastness characteristics over the comparative commercial<br>
products. .<br>
The degree of yellowing as a result of processing was determined for<br>
selected UV absorber examples. A specified amount of inventive and<br>
comparative UV absorbers were added to 2 kg of ClearTuf® 8006 polyester<br>
resin. After thorough mixing, the resin was compounded on a Single-Screw<br>
extruder and the emergent strands of material were pelletlzed. To simulate the<br>
industrial drying process commonly practiced by the converters, the pelletized<br>
sample was dried at 150°C under vacuum for five hours and afterwards injection<br>
molded into175 mil thickness plaques (2 in x 3 in). The degree of yellowing of the<br>
37<br>
plaques, expressed as Yellowness Index (ASTM Test Method E-313) was<br>
quantified with the aid of a MacBeth Coloreye 7000 spectrophotometer.<br>
The yellowness of the inventive and comparative UV absorbers in 175 mil<br>
PET plaques were measured; and the results are tabulated in Table 8.<br>
TABLE 8. Yellowness of the<br>
Inventive and Comparative UV Absorbers in Molded PET<br>
Less than 5% transmission of UV radiation at 390nm in a 15 mil thick wall<br>
container is the best UV protection currently industry can achieve. The UV<br>
absorber loadings are adjusted based on the absorption strength to achieve this<br>
goal. ClearShield UV 390B is a long wavelength UV absorber. When used it<br>
alone in standard PET resin, it could not completely cover short wavelength UV<br>
radiation. At a loading of 1450 ppm UV 390B, a portion of UV radiation between<br>
300- 350nm is still transmitted. In the above table, only the inventive UV<br>
absorber from Example 9 and ClearShield UV 400, at respected loadings,<br>
achieved less than 5% transmission at 390nm.<br>
Under this testing protocol, a Yellowness of at most 25 at the suggested<br>
loading levels is considered to be acceptable. Thus, the inventive UV absorber<br>
exhibited significantly better yellowness rating than the comparatives, showing<br>
the unexpectedly good results provided thereby.<br>
g) Application of the Inventive UV Absorbers in Polypropylene<br>
UV absorbers are commonly used in transparent polyolefin packaging such<br>
as films, containers, etc. to combat the harmful UV light. Two of the most widely<br>
used commercial UV absorbers are Tinuvin® 326 and 327. Since they are low<br>
molecular weight solids, their blooming and migration out of polypropylene<br>
composition during and/or after the injection molding process, is one of a few<br>
highly undesirable characteristics. The inventive liquid polymeric benzotriazole<br>
UV absorbers are thus tested for suitability in polypropylene application. The<br>
protocols for thermoplastic composition formation as well as their performance<br>
' • • : •<br>
evaluations were similar to those as described above, and in US 6,207,740.<br>
r '<br>
Table 9 summarized the Yellowness Index results.<br>
aa<br>
Table 9. Loadings and Yellowness of the Inventive and Comparative UV<br>
A yellowness of less than 10 is considered to be highly desirable for this<br>
application under this test protocol. Thus both inventive and comparative UV<br>
absorbers offered acceptable yellowness performance.<br>
Additionally, although both inventive liquid polymeric UV absorber from<br>
Example 9 and commercial product Tinuvin 326 exhibited excellent thermal<br>
stability and lightfastness (after 20 and 40 hours exposure to Xenon light), the<br>
inventive UV absorber demonstrated a dramatically improved performance in<br>
extraction and plate-out tests. Being liquid in natural and with much improved<br>
migration, the inventive liquid polymeric UV absorber offers more desirable<br>
characteristics for polypropylene applications such as in packaging and in films<br>
and the like.<br>
