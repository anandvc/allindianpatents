				<td>Lubricant composition based on natural and renewable raw materials<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to a lubricant composition based on modified natural and<br>
renewable raw materials, the viscosity of which can be adjusted according to the<br>
application. The invention relates more particularly to biodegradable lubricant<br>
compositions.<br>
From DE 103 29 761 A1, it is known to modify natural and renewable oils using ionizing<br>
radiation. In this, the ionizing radiation exerts its effect over several periods of<br>
exposure, wherein rest periods are provided between these treatment steps. This<br>
modification reaction is run with the addition of initiators, such as chemically catalytic<br>
additives, complex chemical compounds and/or organic accelerators. It is also known<br>
that the degree of modification of the oils to be treated with the ionizing radiation is<br>
influenced by the dosing, the temperature, the dose rate, by oxygen and by the effect of<br>
initiators or inhibitors. However, one drawback of the known modification methods is<br>
that they cannot be implemented on a large industrial scale and generally do not<br>
produce fully reproducible results.<br>
Thus US 4 327 030 A describes a method for modifying native triglyceride-based oils,<br>
wherein said oils are made to react with peroxide at a temperature of 100 to 200 °C.<br>
The polymerized polyunsaturated fatty acid esters are isolated in the resulting residue<br>
and disposed of. This process serves to reduce the linoleic acid content, thereby<br>
increasing the oleic acid content. Therefore, the result is an oil that has a higher oleic<br>
acid content.<br>
The natural oxidation of vegetable oils is also described. Principally, reference is made<br>
to the effective lubricating property of natural triglycerides. However, this property is<br>
severely limited because these oils tend strongly toward oxidation due to their high<br>
covalent bond content, therefore their areas of application are also severely limited.<br>
Moreover, oxidative residues can lead to the failure of components, for example, roller<br>
bearings, as a result of wear and tear.<br>
In order to improve the resistance of these oils to oxidation, it has been proposed to<br>
replace said oils with phenolic and aromatic amine oxidation inhibitors, or to add oil-<br>
soluble copper compounds to said oils.<br>
Due to the growing scarcity of crude oil, the mineral oil components of which continue to<br>
be used as basic materials in the production of lubricant compositions, it will be<br>
necessary in the future to replace these mineral oil constituents with renewable raw<br>
materials. However, the low viscosity of native oils based on natural and renewable raw<br>
materials limits their use as lubricants to a few areas of application.<br>
One problem addressed by the present invention' is to prepare a lubricant composition<br>
based on native renewable triglyceride-based oils, the viscosity of which can be<br>
adjusted according to the desired application. A further problem addressed by the<br>
present invention is to prepare a lubricant composition which contains the modified<br>
native oils, and which exhibits advantageous tribological properties at extreme<br>
temperatures in the high and low temperature ranges and is resistant to oxidation.<br>
This problem is solved by a lubricant composition in which native triglyceride-based oils<br>
are made to react with peroxides, and the unsaturated portions of the fatty acids are<br>
bonded to one another by means of a radical addition reaction. This reaction alters the<br>
viscosity of the modified oil. The viscosity can be adjusted to the desired level based<br>
upon the peroxide/oil ratio, and can thereby be adapted to the requirements of the<br>
respective application. Depending upon the viscosity of the modified oil, the lubricant<br>
composition can be used as an NLGI grade 000, 00 fluid grease, and as a fluid grease<br>
for central lubricating systems and within the framework of gear lubrication, or as a soft<br>
grease of NGLI grades 1 to 4 in plain bearings, roller bearings, and for water pumps, or<br>
as so-called harder greases of NLGI grades 5 and 6, as gasket or briquetted greases.<br>
The lubricant compositions of the present invention are based upon a method for<br>
modifying the viscosity of a native triglyceride-based oil, wherein the native oil is made<br>
to react with a peroxide compound at a temperature of 165°C to 190°C for 3 to 5 hours,<br>
after which the unsaturated covalent bonds are linked by a radical addition reaction.<br>
The by-products produced during polymerization are then removed in a high vacuum.<br>
The oils with modified viscosity produced in this manner can then be further processed<br>
in situ to produce lubricants. To react the native oil with the peroxide compound, 4.8%<br>
to 10.3% of the corresponding peroxide compound is used, depending upon the desired<br>
viscosity of the oil to be produced. The result is an oil having a viscosity of 100 to 1250<br>
mm2/sec. Fig. 1 illustrates viscosity as a function of peroxide concentration.<br>
Accordingly, by using different quantities of peroxide compound, both a high-viscosity oil<br>
and a low-viscosity oil can be produced in an easily reproducible manner.<br>
Both aromatic and aliphatic peroxide compounds can be used as peroxides. Preferably,<br>
the peroxide compound is chosen from the group comprising 1,3-bis(tert-butylperoxy-<br>
isopropyl)benzene, 1,4-bis(tert-butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene, dicumyl peroxide, tert-<br>
butyl cumyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-(tert-butylperoxy)hexane, n-butyl-4,4'-di(tert-<br>
butylperoxy)valerate, 1,1'-di-(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 2,5-dimethyl-<br>
2,5-di-(tert-butylperoxy)hexane. Particularly preferred are aliphatic peroxide<br>
compounds, such as 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-(tert-butylperoxy)hexane or di-tert-butyl<br>
peroxide, for example.<br>
For reaction with the aforementioned peroxides, and for the subsequent radical addition<br>
reaction, oils having a high ratio of unsaturated components, which can be mono- or<br>
polyunsaturated, are particularly well suited. Vegetable oils having a high oleic acid<br>
content are particularly well suited. Olive oil having an oleic acid content of 65% to 85%<br>
is particularly well suited as a natural, non-genetically modified oil. Also preferred are<br>
vegetable oils having an oleic acid content of at least 60%. These can also be<br>
genetically modified to increase the oleic acid content. The native oils are chosen from<br>
the group comprising safflower oil with a high oleic acid content, corn oil with a high<br>
oleic acid content, rapeseed oil with a high oleic acid content, sunflower oil with a high<br>
oleic acid content, soybean oil with a high oleic acid content, flaxseed oil with a high<br>
oleic acid content, peanut oil with a high oleic acid content, "lesquerella" oil with a high<br>
oleic acid content, palm oil with a high oleic acid content, castor oil with a high oleic acid<br>
content, linseed oil with a high oleic acid content, or olive oil with a high oleic acid<br>
content, and mixtures of the aforementioned oils.<br>
The modified oils obtained in this manner, which have a higher viscosity as compared<br>
with the starting oils, are cost-effective in terms of their tribological properties, their<br>
resistance to oxidation, and their range of applications at temperatures of -30°C to<br>
180°C, and can be produced in a reproducible manner. They have the advantage over<br>
mineral oils that they are biodegradable and have limitless availability.<br>
As was described above, using the unsaturated components in the oils, through the<br>
reaction with peroxide, the unsaturated fatty acids are fully or partially bonded to one<br>
another via a radical addition reaction. In this process, the degree of polymerization of<br>
the modified oil is based upon the ratio of the oil to the peroxide. Reaction temperature<br>
and reaction time also influence the degree of polymerization. The behavior of the<br>
modified oils obtained in this manner is greatly improved at low temperatures, however,<br>
said oils can also be used at high temperatures, and have a very high VI, of &gt; 210.<br>
They also have very advantageous tribological properties and superior resistance to<br>
oxidation.<br>
The lubricant compositions based on native, modified oils of the present invention have<br>
polar properties and can be applied to metallic surfaces as thin adhesive films, whereby<br>
an excellent lubricating effect can be achieved. In contrast to lubricants that have a<br>
mineral oil or hydrocarbon base, said lubricating film cannot be easily separated from<br>
the metal surface, which expands the range of applications of the lubricants according<br>
to the invention to include hydraulic applications. In particular, they are more stable<br>
than linear hydrocarbon compositions against thermal and mechanical stresses, due to<br>
their cross-linked structure.<br>
The highly viscous oils based on renewable raw materials are also suitable for fully or<br>
partially replacing the "bright stock," which is used as a basic component in many<br>
lubricants.<br>
In summary, the advantages of lubricant compositions with modified native triglyceride-<br>
based oils are that they are produced from renewable raw materials, and that their base<br>
materials are biodegradable and non-toxic, have high flash points, are thermally stable,<br>
and have superior low temperature behavior. They also adhere better to metallic<br>
surfaces.<br>
The kinematic viscosity of renewable and natural oils, as described in what follows,<br>
ranges from 100 to 1250 mm2/sec at 40°C, depending upon the intended use of the<br>
lubricant composition<br>
The lubricant composition produced using the modified, native oil comprises<br>
(a) 50 to 90 wt% a modified, native triglyceride-based oil with a high oleic acid<br>
content, chosen from the group comprising sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil,<br>
linseed oil, corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, flaxseed oil, peanut oil,<br>
"lesquerella" oil, palm oil, olive oil, or mixtures of the aforementioned oils,<br>
wherein the native oil is made to react with a peroxide, and the unsaturated<br>
covalent bonds are linked by a radical addition reaction, and<br>
(b) 5 to 10 wt% additives or additive mixtures, wherein the viscosity of the modified<br>
native oil ranges from 100 to 1250 mm2/sec.<br>
A lubricant composition of this type is preferably used as transmission oil.<br>
The lubricant composition can further<br>
(c) contain 5 to 30 wt% thickening agent.<br>
A composition of this type is ordinarily used as fluid grease.<br>
If the lubricant composition also contains<br>
(d) 5 to 10 wt% solid lubricants,<br>
in addition to components (a) to (c), it can preferably be used as fluid gear grease.<br>
As was already described above, it is possible to replace a portion of the "bright stock"<br>
with the modified native oil. A lubricant composition of this type also contains<br>
(e) 5 to 45 wt% an additional crude oil component or multiple crude oil components,<br>
in addition to the components (a) to (d).<br>
The thickening agent of the lubricant composition is chosen from the group comprising<br>
urea, aluminum complex soaps, metallic simple soaps of elements of the 1st and 2nd<br>
main groups of the periodic table, metallic complex soaps of elements of the 1st and 2nd<br>
main groups of the periodic table, bentonite, sulfonate, silicate, polyimide or PTFE, or a<br>
mixture of the aforementioned thickening agents.<br>
The solid lubricant is chosen from the group comprising graphite, boron nitride, MoS2,<br>
WS2, SnS, SnS2, or Bi2S3, or a mixture of the aforementioned solid lubricants.<br>
The additive or additive mixture is chosen from the group comprising butyl hydroxy<br>
toluene, dialkyi diphenylamines, alkylated phenyl- alpha-naphthylamines, polymeric<br>
trimethyl dihydroquinoline, sulfurized fatty acid esters, diphenyl cresyl phosphate,<br>
amine-neutralized phosphates, alkylated and non-alkylated triaryl phosphates, alkylated<br>
and non-alkylated triaryl thiophosphates, zinc-dialkyl dithiophosphates, carbamates,<br>
thiocarbamates, zinc-dithiocarbamates, dimercaptothiadiazole, succinic acid semi-ester,<br>
calcium sulfonates, benzotriazole derivatives, K-pentaborates, Na-thiosulfates, and Na-<br>
pyrophosphates.<br>
The crude oil component of the lubricant composition is chosen from the group<br>
comprising paraffin-based and naphthene-based mineral oils, synthetic hydrocarbons,<br>
poly-alpha olefin (PAO), poly-internal olefin (PIO), ethylene-propylene copolymers,<br>
group III oils, synthetic esters, polyalkylene glycols or alkyl aromatics, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
It is particularly advantageous that the oil is made to react with the peroxide prior to use,<br>
and then the corresponding additives, such as thickening agents like silicates,<br>
sulfonates, polyimides, metallic soaps, metallic soap complexes, ureas, and bentonites,<br>
are added in situ to the already polymerized oil. The polymerized oils can also be<br>
mixed with other crude oil components, such as paraffin-based and naphthene-based<br>
mineral oils, synthetic hydrocarbons (poly-alpha olefin, poly-internal olefin, ethylene-<br>
propylene copolymers), group III oils, synthetic esters, polyalkylene glycols (PAG), and<br>
alkyl aromatics, in lubricant formulations. Customary anti-wear additives and solid<br>
lubricant additives such as triaryl phosphates, triaryl thiophosphates, zinc dialkyl<br>
dithiophosphates, carbamates, thiocarbamates, zinc-dithiocarbamates, M0S2, graphite,<br>
boron nitride, PTFE, Na-thiosulfates, Na-pyrophosphates, etc., can be used here.<br>
Phenolic and aminic antioxidants are customarily used as antioxidants, wherein<br>
polymerized trimethyl dihydroquinoline or sulfurized fatty acid esters are preferably<br>
used.<br>
Advantageously, the lubricant compositions according to the invention can be rapidly<br>
and reproducibly mixed, shortly before use, in a so-called one-pot reaction.<br>
In what follows, the use of the lubricant composition according to the invention as<br>
transmission oils for a worm gear will be described. Together with suitable<br>
phosphorous-based and sulfur-based additives, along with butyl hydroxy toluene, dialkyl<br>
diphenylamine, diphenyl cresol phosphate, amine-neutralized phosphate, succinic acid<br>
semi-ester, and triazole derivative, a polymerized sunflower oil with a high oleic acid<br>
content, which is based upon the ISO VG 460 standard, is developed. The ratio of the<br>
aforementioned additive mixture is approximately 6%. The lubricant composition is<br>
tested on a worm gear test stand for 300 hours. This study showed that the modified<br>
sunflower oil has an efficiency level of 70 to 80%, and therefore achieves the efficiency<br>
level of traditional transmission oils having a polyalpha olefin- and polyalkylene glycol<br>
base. With respect to a reduction in wear and tear, and the rapid build-up of a<br>
hydrodynamic lubricating film at the point of friction, the lubricant composition according<br>
to the invention far outperforms conventional transmission oils. The results shown in<br>
figure 2, which were obtained on the worm gear test stand, support this.<br>
More particularly, the very low abrasive wear over the running time of 300 h and the<br>
very rapidly onset hydrodynamic lubrication emphasize the advantageous lubricating<br>
properties of a native transmission oil of this type.<br>
As a further example of the lubricant composition according to the invention, a urea<br>
grease of NLGI grade 1 was developed. This roller bearing grease contains 52 wt%<br>
ISO VG 460 polymerized, modified sunflower oil having a high oleic acid content, 38.3<br>
wt% mineral oil (bright stock), along with 6.59 wt% thickening agent and 3.05 wt% an<br>
additive mixture consisting of Zn-dialkyl dithiophosphate, sulfurized fatty acid ester,<br>
benzotriazole and antioxidant, for thermal stabilization. This grease concept makes it<br>
possible to achieve L 50 values of &gt; 100 h on the FE9 test machine at 140 °C. Figure 3<br>
shows the test conditions and results of the FE9 test.<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Fig. 4, even with a bright stock content of 
running time can be extended significantly, and the modified sunflower oil can be<br>
thermally stabilized using suitable additives.<br>
One example of a colorless, biodegradable fluid transmission oil is a composition<br>
consisting of a modified sunflower oil, to which a calcium soap has been added as<br>
thickening agent, which oil has a viscosity of 700 mm2/sec at 40°C. Said lubricant<br>
composition has been compared with a lubricant composition having a mineral oil base<br>
and an aluminum soap as thickening agent, and also containing graphite as a solid<br>
lubricant.<br>
Table 1<br>
As is shown in Table 1, the lubricating grease composition of the present invention,<br>
which is based on a biodegradable, modified sunflower oil, produces the same, if not<br>
better, results than a standard fluid grease. Furthermore, it is biodegradable and<br>
colorless, i.e., a solid lubricant like graphite can be dispensed with. Therefore,<br>
customer demand for greases that are not black can be met.<br>
A further use of the modified native triglyceride-based oils involves their use in an<br>
application kit containing 70 to 90 wt% modified sunflower oil polymer having a<br>
kinematic viscosity of 100 to 1250 mm2/sec at 40°C, particularly from 350 to 550<br>
mm2/sec at 40°C, and 30 to 10 wt% a lithium-based soap, wherein the constituents are<br>
mixed together directly prior to application, producing a grease of NLGI grade 0 to 2,<br>
and wherein the lithium-based soap is produced by the direct saponification of modified<br>
sunflower polymer using LiOH x H2O in a 1:1 molar ratio. A kit of this type can be used,<br>
for example, in plain bearings.<br>
