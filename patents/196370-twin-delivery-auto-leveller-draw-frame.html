				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved twin delivery auto- leveller draw frame . The twin delivery auto- leveller draw frame is useful for the production of quality drafted slivers for further processing in the down stream machines for producing high quality spun yam. The twin delivery auto- leveller draw frame of the present invention has the advantage of two working heads working at different delivery speeds at a given time  This facilitates the machine to process different material/sliver counts on the individual heads at a time. The efficiency of the machine enhanced as the problem like sliver breakage, sliver run out stop motion actuation will not cause the other head idle. In addition it is possible to use one of the heads as breaker by switching off the auto-leveller leveler and the other head as finisher with auto-leveller leveler. Therefore the machine of the present invention is advantageous as compared to the hitherto machines.<br>
The textile fibres are drafted when slivers pass through pairs of drafting rollers and top rollers provided in the textile draw frame of The top rollers apply the required pressure to the fibres to be drafted. Conventionally, drafting is effected in two zones, namely the pre drafting zone and the main drafting zone. The surface speed of the drafting rollers have direct influence in achieving the desired drafting and therefore it is essential that the drafting rollers revolve at the desired speed without any variation. This is particularly relevant in the case of high speed auto- leveller draw frames.<br>
At present drafting rollers are driven by using either toothed belts or flat belts. Though toothed belt drive ensure positive drive, it is not always possible to achieve the required velocity ratio between the drafting rollers. This is particularly noticed when the required velocity ratio is in fraction.<br>
Flat belt drive results in variation of surface speed of the drafting rollers mainly due to the inherent tendency of flat belts to slip during operation. This is especially noticed when the bah do not adequately envelop the pulleys.<br><br>
We have in our co pending application no 1106 /MAS /2000 described a system for driving the drafting rollers of textile draw frame . The said system is shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification. The system for driving the drafting rollers of textile draw frame disclosed therein avoids the above referenced draw backs in drafting roller driving system.<br>
The system for driving the drafting rollers of a textile draw frame comprising a drivable intermediate shaft connected to the front drafting roller of said draw frame by means of a first endless poly V belt provided with ribbed inner surface through pulleys mounted on said intermediate shaft member and said front drafting roller, said front drafting roller being fiirther connected to the middle drafting roller of said draw frame by means of a second endless poly V belt, mounted on a set of pulleys provided on said front drafting roller and said middle drafting roller, each of said endless poly V belts being provided with tensioners.<br>
The multiple endless poly V belt drive system described herein above transmits power from the intermediate shaft to the drafting rollers very uniformly thus avoiding the drawbacks of the existing system. It is possible to locate the tensioner at different setting distances to enable the drive system to be used in pre drafting zones also.<br>
Accordingly the intermediate shaft is indicated by reference numeral (1). The pulley on this said shaft is shown by numeral (2) and the endless poly V belt mounted thereon is indicated by reference numeral(6). The front drafting roller(5) has a first pulley (4) through which the endless poly V belt is comiected to transmit power from the driven intermediate shaft(l). The front drafting roller has a second pulley (3) which aligns with a pulley (8) mounted on the middle drafting roller (9). An endless poly V belt (10) provided with a tensioner (11) connects the front drafting roller(5) with middle drafting roller(9) for effective transmission of the drive to the middle roller(9). Reference numeral (7) shows the tensioner provided for the poly V belt(6) connecting the intermediate shaft(l) to the front drafting roller(5).<br><br>
This drive system assures smooth drive of the drafting rollers resulting in better quality drafted slivers.<br>
In textile draw frames, sliver from down stream machine is fed to the drafting system through a creel. Sliver is drafted according to the desired requirement in the drafting system. From the drafting zone, the drafted sliver is collected by way of web guide and is delivered to the coiler through a pair of delivery rollers. Displacement of delivery rollers to accommodate the variation of the mass of sliver is an essential requirement.<br>
In our CO pending application no 1105 /MAS/ 2000 we described a radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw frames  which is shown in Fig 2<br>
The radially swingable delivery roller system for textile draw fi-ames disclosed in the application No. 1105/MAS/2000 comprises a fixed delivery roller shaft shown by numeral( 12) is mounted in the bearings of a fixed bearing assembly (13). A movable delivery roller shaft ( 14 ) is mounted movably in the movable bearing assembly (15). Each of these shafts are provided with delivery rollers (16) and (16a) at one end. The other ends of the shafts (12,14) is provided with drive pulleys (17a) and (17); the axis of the moving bearing assembly is always parallel to the axis of the   fixed bearing  assembly.<br>
The drive means for the delivery rollers consist of a pulley (18) mounted on a rotatable intermediate shaft ( not shown in the drawings). Three deflection rollers (19), (20) and (21) of which the axis of roller (19) located in the fixed bearing assembly form a part of the drive means. Drive to the delivery rollers is taken from the pulley (18) through endless flat bek(22). The endless belts (23) and (24) connect drive pulleys (17) and (17a) with the deflection rollers (19) and (21). Flat belt (22) connects the pulley (18) and deflection roller (20,25,26 ).<br><br>
The routing of the belt (22) is such that the delivery rollers shafts rotate in the opposite direction. The outer surface of this flat belt (22) envelops deflection roller (25) and the inner surface of belt envelops deflection roller (26). The deflection roller (20) is provided with an eccentric pin (27). The envelope of the belt (22) over deflection roller (25) is adjustable through this eccentric pin(27). The delivery rollers (16) and (16a) may be provided with the shoulders which acts as guide means to the sliver passing through condenser (28) Which feeds the sliver between the delivery rollers (16) and (16a).<br>
In the textile industry the existence of can coilers /rotary plate for sliver depositing are very well known. DE -PS patent no 15 10 310- discloses a rotary plate for depositing fiber slivers in spinning cans. In this, rotary plate for depositing fiber slivers in spinning can is provided with channel guiding the fiber sliver from an inlet element letting out at the top and in the rotational axis of the rotary plate via a curve in the form of an arc to an outlet element which is tangential to the rotary plate and letting out approximately at its circumference . Between the inlet element and its outlet element, the channel is provided with a straight and radially extending intermediate piece .<br>
It is observed that such a rotary plate has the disadvantage of poor and uneven sliver deposit especially when used in combination with the modem high speed machines.<br>
Another can coiler /rotary plate has been disclosed in DE-PS 1115 623 . In this device the channel is made up telescopically of at least two pipe bends in the form of arcs and circle. The course of the channel can be adapted to the different can diameters by means of the telescope like construction of the pipe bends. The two pipe bends are provided with straight ends at their connection point.<br>
This device has also the disadvantage of poor and uneven sliver deposit especially when used in combination with the modern high speed machines. In addition it has the disadvantage of that the fiber sliver must be led over the edge of the pipe bend and goes through a changed channel profile .Especially in modern high speed machines such a<br><br>
construction is not very conducive to great precision in the deposit of the fiber sliver and for careful handling of the fiber sliver. Deposit may form at the edge of the device and become detached from time to time thereby leading to irregularities in the fiber sliver.<br>
In the Indian patent nol81082 dated T"" October 1992 ( corresponding to the US patent no 5317786) another can coiler/ rotary plate has been disclosed which has a spatially curved sliver channel (29) which is formed from a tubular piece having two directly merging arcs , the sliver channel (29) and / or cover of the rotary plate (31) on the imderside thereof is advantageously made of refined steel. This can coiler is shown in Fig 3 of the drawing accompanying this specification . It has been sated that by such an arrangement ,it is ensured that a deposition which is as even and as gentle to the sliver as possible.<br>
In an another Indian patent no 181273 dated 19"' January 1993 a can coiler /revolving plate for a spinning preparation machine has been disclosed comprising a base body with an un machined surface having a large degree of surface roughness and a cover of low friction material fitted on the underside of the revolving plate . By such a construction it is sated that the rejection rate during manufacturing process is reduced . Such a can coiler is shown in Fig 4 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
In yet another Indian patent no 181435 dated 19"^ January 1993 a silver channel for a spinning preparation machine for depositing sliver in a container has been disclosed wherein the sliver channel (29) is made in the form of a helix of varying pitch .It is stated that for more even guidance and more cost effective production of the sliver channel it is advantages to have a constant and circular cross section. Accordingly the helical form for the sliver channel has been proposed according to this patent. This is shown in Fig 5 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br><br>
Due to the advancement of the technology and the availability of high speed spinning machines it has become necessary that appropriate improvements have also to be made on various aspects of the rotary plate so as to match the above machines. Under the above said circumstances regular work is being conducted to find out better performance of spinning machines. From the above survey of prior art it can be observed that one of the areas where improvements are taking place is in respect of the construction of the rotary plates especially in the sliver channel.<br>
Accordingly in our co pending application no 820/ MAS /2001 we have disclosed an improved can coiler for sliver depositing particularly in drawing frames and carders .<br>
The improved rotary plate (31) for spinning preparatory machine for depositing sliver comprising a coiler housing ( 32&amp;33 ) and a tubular sliver channel (29), the tubular sliver channel (29) which is housed within the coiler housing (32&amp;33)in such a way that the sliver passing through the tubular sliver channel is deposited gently in to the sliver can (30) kept at the bottom of the can coiler , the tubular sliver channel comprising a straight portion (34) ),a curved first portion (35) at the feed end formed with radius in the range of 40 to70mm (Ri) , a curved second portion (36)at the delivery end formed with radius in the range of 40 to 70 mm (Rd) , an inclined spiral portion (37) merging with both the curved portions in such a way that the forces which exert on the sliver as a result of the movement of the sliver in the tubular channel wall is minimum as possible, the angle between the planes of the curved portions and the inclined spiral portion being in the range 10 to 40 deg. This is shown in Figs 6-10 .<br>

In the existing known twin delivery draw frame machines, the working heads are not independent and are depending on each other. Both the working heads are workable at particular delivery speed, at a given time due to its inherent drive arrangement. Due to this, it is not possible to process different material/ sliver counts on the individual heads at a time. More over the interruptions on one of the heads due to problems like sliver breakage, sliver run out and stop motion actuation will cause the other head also idle. This will have a direct influence in the reduction of overall efficiency of the machine.<br>
With the above aim in mind and with the knowledge of the inventions we developed and covered in our above said co pending applications for patents we directed our Research to develop a twin delivery auto-leveller draw frame machine constituting two independent working heads in all aspects.<br>
Considering the importance of achieving efficiency in twin delivery draw frame we observed that if a twin delivery auto-leveller draw frame machine is provided constituting two independent working heads in all aspects, it is possible to process different materials say carded coxmt in one head and combed counts in one head since it<br><br>
is possible to run the individual heads at different speeds. Since the heads are totally independent, the interruptions in one of the heads due to problem like sliver breakage, running out of feed material, doffing etc will not have any influence in the working of the other head . Such a facility will have a direct influence on the enhancement of overall efficiency of the machine .<br>
Therefore , the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved twin delivery auto-leveller draw firame, which can have all the utilities of two single delivery auto-leveller draw frame machines.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a twin delivery auto-leveller draw frame, which can have all the utilities of two single delivery auto-leveller draw frame machines in which different material / sliver counts can be processed on the individual heads at a time.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved twin delivery auto-leveller draw frame, which can have all the utilities of two single delivery auto-leveller draw frame machines in which the interruptions on one of the heads due to problems like sliver breakage, sliver run out etc will not stop the working of other head thereby enhancing the  overall efficiency of the machine.<br>

Detailed description of the drive system:<br>
The drive system consisting of independent motors and the drive elements for the heads. The drive system comprising of constant magnitude power drive means for driving certain drive elements of the machine which are independent of the variation in the in feed sliver and process parameters and variable magnitude power drive means for certain drive elements which are dependent on the variation in the feed sliver and other processing parameters.<br>
For simplicity the details of the drive system of the head arranged on the left hand side of the machine frame is explained and similar arrangement of drive system is employed for the driving the elements of the head arranged on the right hand side of the frame.<br>
Constant magnitude power drive means:<br>
The drive from the main motor Ml (refer to Fig. 12) is transmitted to the main drive shaft (41) by belt drive means. Pulley (42) is rotatably mounted on the main drive shaft (41). Pulley (43) is rotatably mounted on the delivery-drafting roller (44). The constant magnitude power from pulley (42) is transmitted to pulley (43) and thereby to the delivery-drafting roller (44) through the belt (45).<br>
Also the pulley (42) transmits the constant magnitude power to the pulley (46) which is rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft (47) through the belt (45) .On the other side of the intermediate shaft (47), pulley (48) is rotatably mounted. Pulley(49)is rotatably mounted on the shaft (50).

The constant magnitude power from the pulley (18) is transmitted to the drive system of the delivery rollers (16) and (16a)<br>
The constant magnitude power from pulley (52) is transmitted to the rotary plate (31) and can plate (53) by belt drive means.<br>
12<br><br>
Variable magnitude power drive means;<br>
On the main drive shaft (41), pulley (54) is rotatably mounted. Pulley (55) is rotatably mounted on the drive shaft (56) of the differential gearing (DG). Part of the power from the motor Ml is transmitted to the pulley (55) by the pulley (54) through the belt (57). Variable speed motor (M2) drivingly connected to the differential gearing (DG) to provide variable magnitude power, which depends on the variation in the sliver mass sensed by the sensing rollers (58) and (59).Tlie resultant variable magnitude power from the differential gearing (DG) is transmitted to the pulley (60) which is rotatably mounted on the shaft (61). Pulley (62) is rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft shaft (1). The variable magnitude power is transmitted from pulley (60) to (62) by the belt (63) to the intermediate shaft (1). Pulley (2) is rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft (1) and pulley (4) is rotatably mounted on the front delivery roller (5). The variable magnitude power is transmitted from pulley (2) to (4) by tlie poly V belt (6), thereby to the front drafting roller (5).<br>
Pulley (3) is rotatably mounted on the front drafting roller (5). Pulley (8) is rotatably mounted on the middle-drafting roller (9). The variable magnitude power is transmitted from pulley (3) to (8) there by to the middle-drafting roller (9) by the poly V belt (10). Pulley (64) is rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft (1) while pulley (65) is rotatably mounted on the shaft (66) which drives the sensing rollers (58) and (59). Variable magnitude power from pulley (64) is transmitted to pulley (65) and to the sensing roller (58) and (59) through belt (67).<br>
Pulley (68) and (69) are rotatably mounted on the shaft (66) and (70) respectively. On the shaft (70) feed roller (71) is rotatebly mounted. The variable magnitude power from pulley (68) is transmitted to pulley (69) and to the feed roller (71) through the belt (72). Another feed roller (71a) engages with the feed roller (71) and derives its motion by friction means thereby delivers the sliver to the sensing roller pair (58) &amp; (59), when sliver is fed between them.<br>
13<br><br>
The belt (72) also drives the pulley (73) rotatebly mounted on shaft (74) and transmits the variable magnitude power to the shaft (74). Pulleys (75) and (76) are rotatably mounted on the shaft (74) and (77) respectively. On the other side of the shaft (77), creel roller (78) is rotatably mounted. The variable magnitude power from the shaft (74) is transmitted to shaft (77) and creel roller (78) through pulley (75) and (76) by means of beh (79). Another creel roller (78a) engages with the creel roller (78) and derives its rotary motion through friction means. The sliver from the feed can is fed between the creel rollers (78) and (78a) and delivered to the feed roller pair (71) and (71a).<br>
Figure 13 shows an alternative drive arrangement for transmitting the variable magnitude power means, which is explained as under:<br>
The variable speed motor (M3) provides the variable magnitude power. The magnitude of the variable magnitude power is the algebraic sum of certain constant values and the required increase or decrease of the rotational speed of the drafting rollers (5,9),sensing rollers (58,59),feed rollers (71,71a) and the creel rollers (78,78a) , according to the sliver mass variation sensed by the sensing rollers (58,59). In this embodiment the usage of differential gearing is eliminated. Suitable means are provided for the synchronized rotation of all the rotating elements of the machine.<br>
Variable speed motor ( M3 )is fitted on the shaft (61). On the other side of the shaft (61) a pulley (60) is rotatebly mounted. Pulley (62) is rotatebly mounted on the intermediate shaft (1) and the pulleys (60)and (62)transmit the variable magnitude power to the intermediate shaft (1) through the belt (63). Pulley (2) is rotatably mounted on the other side of the intermediate shaft (1) and pulley (4) is rotatably mounted on the front drafting roller (5). The variable magnitude power from intermediate shaft (1) is transmitted to the front drafting roller (5) by pulleys (2) and (4) through poly V belt (6). Pulley (3) and (8) are rotatably mounted on front drafting roller (5) and middle drafting roller (9) respectively. The variable magnitude power from front drafting roller (5) is transmitted to the middle-drafting roller (9) by the pulleys (3) and (8) through poly V belt (10).<br>

Pulleys (64) and (65) are rotatably mounted on the intermediate shaft (1) and shaft (66) respectively and the shaft (66) drives the sensing rollers (58) and (59). The variable magnitude power is transmitted to the sensing rollers(58) and (59) by the pulleys (64) and (65) through the belt (67).<br>
Pulley (69) and the feed roller (71) are rotatably mounted on the shaft (70), and pulley (68) is rotatably mounted on the shaft (66). Belt (72) transmits the variable magnitude power to the feed roller (71) through pulleys (68) and (69). Another feed roller (71a) engages with the feed roller (71) and derives its motion by friction means thereby delivers the sliver to the sensing roller pair (58,59) when fed between them.<br>
Pulleys (75) and (73) are rotatably mounted on the shaft (74). Belt (72) transmits the variable magnitude power to the shaft (74) through the pulleys (68) and (73). Pullej^s (76) and creel roller (78) are rotatably mounted on the shaft (77). The variable magnitude power from shaft (74) is transmitted to the creel roller (78) by the belt (79) through the pulleys (75) and (76). Another creel roller (78a) engages with the creel roller (78) and derives its rotary motion through friction means. The sliver from the feed can is fed between the creel rollers (78) and (78a) and delivered to the feed roller pair (71) and (71a).<br>
WORKING OF THE MACHINE:<br>
For simplicity the details of the working of the head arranged on the left hand side of the machine frame is explained and the same holds good for the head arranged on the right hand side of the frame also.<br>
Plurality of sliver cans (SC) consisting of carded or combed sliver processed in the preparatory machines are arranged in the sliver feeding device (81). The sliver from the sliver cans (SC) fed to the nip of the rotating creel rollers (78,78a) through suitable guides .The creel roller (78) is driven by belt through gearing and the other feed roller (78a) resting over the creel roller (78) is driven by friction means. The sliver delivered by the creel rollers (78,78a) is fed to the feed rollers (71,71a) of the inlet arrangement and<br>
15<br><br>
there on to the nip of the sensing rollers (58,59) of the sensing arrangement (82) . The sensing rollers are rotate ably arranged on anti friction bearings and drivingly connected through gearings. The sensing rollers (58,59) are held against each other under spring force and the distance between them is preset according to the mass of the sliver passing between them. The sensing arrangement is provided with sensing means to sense the variation in the sliver mass passing tlirough the sensing rollers (58,59). The emerging sliver from the sensing rollers (58,59) is fed to the drafting rollers (5,9,44) on which top rollers are rotate ably mounted and driven by the drafting rollers by friction means. The top rollers are mounted on the loading arm and are provided with arrangement for loading the top rollers by spring pressure to fecilitate drafting of the sliver.<br>
The variation in the mass of the feed sliver sensed by the sensing rollers (58,59) is used for the generation of necessary signals to determine the rotational speed of the variable speed motor (M2) by the digital auto leveler (88), which provides the variable magnitude power in combination with the constant magnitude power provided by the motor (Ml) for driving the drafting rollers (5,9) through the differential gearing (DG), for leveling the variation in the feed sliver mass by altering the speed of the drafting rollers (5,9) at the appropriate time when the material with the variation reaches the drafting zone. Also, the combined variable magnitude power provided by the motor (Ml) and (M2) is used for the driving of the sensing rollers (58,59), feed rollers (71,71a) and the creel rollers (78,78a).<br>
Alternatively as explained earlier, the variable speed motor (M3) provides the variable magnitude power to drive the drafting rollers (5,9), sensing rollers (58,59), feed rollers (71,71a) and the creel rollers (78,78a). The drafted sliver is deposited in the rotating sliver can (30) mounted on the can plate (53 ) via the calendar rollers (16,16a) and the rotary plate (31). .It may be noted that the rotation speed of the delivery drafting roller (44),calendar roller (16,16a), rotary plate (31) and the can plate ( 53 ) is governed by the constant magnitude power delivered by the motor (Ml).<br>
Once the sliver can (30) is filled with pre-determined length of sliver, the working head is halted and the can pusher (89) ejects the full can out of the can plate (92). The empty<br>
16<br><br>
sliver can positioned on the additional can plate (91) is pushed to the working position by the can changer (90 ). Soon after the can change cycle, the head is restarted . Can magazine (93) may be advantageously used for accommodating the empty sliver cans and to deliver them on to the additional can plate (91) at the end of doffing cycle, for subsequent transfer to the working position.<br>
Advantages of the present invention :<br>
1.	In the device since the working heads are totally independent without depending on each other they can be worked at different delivery speed, at a given time. This facilitates the machine to process different material/ sliver counts on the individual heads at a time<br>
2.	The interruptions on one of the heads due to problems like sliver breakage, sliver run out and stop motion actuation will not cause the other head idle thereby enhancing the efficiency of the machine.<br>
3.	It is possible to use one of the heads as breaker by switching off the auto-leveller and the other head as finisher with auto-leveller<br><br><br>
