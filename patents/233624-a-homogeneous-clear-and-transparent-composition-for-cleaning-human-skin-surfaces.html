In an embodiment, the c\il ofMentha spicata var. viridis is obtained from the leaves of<br>
the plant by hydro-distillation using Clevenger apparatus.<br>
In another embodiment, citronella oil is obtained from the leaves of plant commonly<br>
called "Citronella' or Cymbopogon winterianus.<br>
In still another embodiment, the oil from the plant Cymbopogon winterianus is<br>
obtained by hydro-distillation.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the surface disinfectant composition "SW" is applied onto<br>
a piece of soft wet cloth and the same is spread over the infected area and left for 5<br>
minutes for effective disinfection. In another embodiment, the composition "SW" is<br>
used to effectively clean decontaminate the surfaces are kitchen platform, ceramic<br>
tiles, marbles, cabinets, tables, and likewise. The composition is used in the range of<br>
IX to 100X.<br>
The following experiments shown as examples of the invention were critically<br>
performed to formulate and use the herbal disinfectants of surfaces and hands and<br>
skin possessing anti-microbial action development.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of first level combination<br>
First level combination (MMA) is prepared by mixing menthol and menthyl acetate in<br>
the ratio of 40:60 (W/V). Menthol is obtained by crystallization at minus 60°C of oil<br>
isolated from Mentha arvensis commonly referred to as Menthol  Mint plant.<br>
Crystallization of L-menthol was carried out by slow and gradual chilling of the oil up<br>
to -60°C in deep freezer (Tandon, et al., J. Med. Arom. Plant Sci., 1998, 20: 25-27).<br>
Menthyl acetate occurs naturally in mint oil however the content is very low and<br>
hence the isolation procedure may  be  laborious.  Therefore , the  menthyl  acetate<br>
was   prepared by direct or azeotropic esterification of menthol with corresponding<br>
acid ie., acetic acid and therefore can be produced in large quantities (Arctander.S., In<br>
Perfume and flavor chemicals. Vol-1, Montclair; New Jersey, No. 1845-1852; Ahmad,<br>
A., et a\.J.Essent. Oil Res., 2000, 12 In Press).   'H and 13C-NMR, Mass and IR<br>
spectra confirmed the structure of the acyl derivative.<br>
Example-2: Preparation of'Mentha spicata var. viridis 'oil and 'Citronella' oil<br>
Essential oil rich in piperitenone oxide of the leaves of Mentha spicata var. viridis<br>
was isolated by hydro-distillation process using clavenger apparatus. The process of<br>
hydro-distillation is known and can be performed by a person skilled in the art. The<br>
citronella oil was also obtained by hydro-distillation of the leaves of plant commonly<br>
called 'Citronella' (Cymbopogon winterianus). Both citronella and Mentha spicata<br>
var. viridis oil were stored in the refrigerator until use. The major constituents of these<br>
oils were analyzed and identified using standards by Gas-Liquid chromatography<br>
(GLC).  Both these plant materials are available as planting/seed materials for<br>
cultivation at CIMAP (Central Institute of Medicianl and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow,<br>
India). In addition citronella oil is also available in the market. The composition of<br>
both Mentha spicata var viridis oil and the Cymbopogon winterianus (citronella) oils<br>
are provided hereinbelow:<br>
Constituents of Mentha spicata var viridis oil as determined by GLC:<br>
Total oil yield = 0.36 to 0.65 %; Limonene = 1.50 to 6.52 %; Carvone = 0.10 to 4.42<br>
%; Piperitenone oxide = 28.5 to 77.48 %.<br>
Constituents (%) of Cymbopogon winterianus oil as determined by GLC:<br>
Total oil yield = 0.80; Methyl heptenone = 0.97; Linalool = 0.57; Geraniol = 23.3;<br>
Elemol =  10.67; Geranyl acetate = 3.27; bisafalol = 1.48; Citronellol = 9.92;<br>
Limonene = 1.50; Citronellal = 35.94.<br>
Example-3: Preparation of surface disinfectant "SW"<br>
The surface disinfectant 'SW" is prepared in a step-wise manner as described below:<br>
A)	First a solution of sodium hydroxide (0.0005 N) and sodium lauryl sulphate<br>
(0.0025%) (referred as solution B) is prepared.<br>
B)	To prepare one litre of 100X 'SW, mix all the constituents in the following order:<br>
1.	Take 20 ml Mentha spicata var. viridis oil in a 1000 ml measuring cylinder<br>
2.	Add 10 ml Citronella oil to it and mix<br>
3.	Add 100 ml 2-ethoxyethanol and again mix properly<br>
4.	Now make up the volume with solution B.<br>
5.	Then add 100 ml benzalkonium chloride<br>
C) The final composition of SW will be<br><br>
•	Mentha spicata var. viridis     :0. 02 %; (range 0.01-0.05%)<br>
•	Citronella oil	:0. 01%; (range 0.005- 0.05%)<br>
•	2-ethoxyethanol	:0. 1%; (range 0.05 - 1.0%)<br>
•	Benzalkonium chloride	:0. 1%; (range 0.05 - 5.0%)<br>
•	Sodium hydroxide	:0. 0005 N (range 0.0001 - 0.2N) and<br>
•	Sodium lauryl sulphate	:0. 0025% (range 0.001 - 1.0%)<br>
If the constituents are not mixed in the order given above the resultant solution will<br>
not be clear and transparent and hence will not be effective against the bacteria and<br>
fungi.<br>
Example-4: Preparation of hand and skin disinfectant *HK'<br>
Based on the antimicrobial activity detected in the oils of many higher plants a hand<br>
disinfectant called 'HK' which consist of Herbal essential oils with anti-microbe<br>
action, Iso-propanol, Ethanol, Benzalkonium chloride, permitted coloring agents was<br>
developed. The composition and method of preparation of'HK' is mentioned below.<br>
To prepare one litter of 'HK', mix all the constituents in the following order.<br>
1.	Take 0.2 ml of Mentha spicata var. viridis oil in a measuring cylinder.<br>
2.	Add 1.0 ml of first level combination (MMA) to it and mix.<br>
3.	Add 50 ml of ethanol and mix thoroughly.<br>
4.	Add 300 ml of isopropyl alcohol and mix gently.<br>
5.	Make up the volume to 997 ml with distilled water.<br>
6.	Add 3.0 ml of benzalkonium chloride.<br>
If the constituents are not mixed in the order given above the resultant solution will<br>
not be clear and transparent and hence will not be effective against the bacteria and<br>
fungi.<br>
The resulting solution will have a composition of<br>
Mentha spicata var. viridis: 0.02% (range 0.01- 0.05%)<br>
MMA	: 0.10% (range 0.05 - 0.5%)<br>
Ethanol	: 5.00% (range 1- 25%)<br>
Isopropanol	: 30.00'      mge5-50%)<br>
Benzalkonium Chloride         : 0.30% (range 0.1 - 0.5%)<br>
Distilled water	: to make up the volume.<br>
Example-5: Evaluation of the antiseptic property of the disinfectants<br>
For assessing the antiseptic properties, the disinfectants were tested against<br>
of human pathogenic bacteria and fungi.<br>
The bacteria used are as shown hereblow in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 MTCC, Microbial type culture collection ; UDSC, University of Delhi South Campus; A11MS, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, PGI, Post-Graduate Medical Education &amp; Reasearch Institute.<br>
h MH, Mueller-Hinton agar; BHI. Brain heart infusion agar; SDA. Sabauraud dextrose agar.<br>
The disinfectants were used as such or diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide to the required concentration just before use. The stock solutions and the samples were stored in dark bottles in refrigerator (6-8°C). Disc diffusion assay (Bauer, A.W., et a/, American J. Clinical Pathology, 1966, 45 (4): 493-496) was performed to detect the presence of antibacterial activities. The bacterial strains used in this study were obtained from Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh; India. All bacteria were sub-cultured from -80°C stock cultures into 5 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth and incubated for 24 h at desired temperatures. For use as an inoculum, the turbidity of the bacterial suspension was adjusted to the McFarland standard (0.5). Observations were recorded after 48h of incubation of plates at desired temperatures. If the zone of growth inhibition recorded is high then, the antiseptic property of the disinfectant is also considered good. The data is recorded in table-2,<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br>
Example-6: Evaluation of the anti-fungal properties of the disinfectants<br>
Antifungal activity testing of the disinfectants was done as per (Wannisorn, et al, Antifungal activity of lemon grass oil and lemon grass oil cream. Phytotherapy Research 10, 551-554, 1996). Fungal cultures were grown on SDA at 28°C for seven days. Suspension of each fungus was prepared in 0.85% normal saline containing<br>
0.1% Tween 80. For use as inoculum, the turbidity of the fungal suspensions was also<br>
adjusted to the McFarland standard 0.5.<br>
Two-fold serial dilution technique was employed to assess the minimum inhibitory<br>
dilution  (MID)  of a  given  compound.   In  each assay 20|aL of fungal  culture<br>
(ca.0.7x!05 spores or 0.2 x 105 CPU in the case of yeast) prepared as  before   was<br>
added   to   medium   in   a   tube, which was, incubated under appropriate culture<br>
conditions and examined by visible turbidity. The MID was treated as the lowest<br>
dilution of the test compound, which inhibited the appearance of visible growth. The<br>
antifungal property of both the disinfectants is shown in table-3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example-7: Practical test on volunteers<br>
Hands and palms of 36 volunteers was soiled with the clay collected from the garbage site and thumb impression was made on the surface of the sterile nutrient agar plate @ 20 plates / volunteer before and after cleaning the thumb with cotton swab containing hand disinfectants at the recommended dose. Thumb impressions made after washing with water was taken as control. The exposed plates were then incubated for 3 days for 37°C. The amount of growth of microbes on the agar plates were observed and scored in terms of percentage. Presence of even a single colony i.e., the single cell was considered as not effective. Hence, a volunteer reporting no microbial growth in any of the 20 plates indicate 100 % killing efficiency   <br>
I     Totafpositive     {         32<br><br>
05<br><br>
*	No killing was observed after washing the hand with tap water.<br>
+ Killing occurred<br>
-	No killing occurred<br>
From the data presented above it is clearly evident that nearly 32/37 i.e., 86 % of the volunteers reported 100% killing efficiency after treatment with surface disinfectant. Another 14 % reported 90% or above killing efficiency. Example-8: Method of use of the surface disinfectant 'SW The surface disinfectant 'SW is used to clean and effectively decontaminate any hard surface. If the surface to be used is heavily soiled and is expected to contain a heavy microbial load such as in hospitals and high-risk areas, then it is used undiluted to obtain the best results. In this case the disinfectant is applied onto a piece of soft wet cloth and the same is spread over the infected area and left for 5 minutes for effective disinfection. For medium risk areas the disinfectants are used after diluting ten folds in water. The dilution is done typically in a bucket of water and the spreading is done as before. The disinfectant is used after 100-fold dilution for low risk area such as house and offices.<br>
Example-9: Method of use of the hand disinfectant 'HK'<br>
The hand disinfectant 'HK' is used to clean and effectively decontaminate hand and other surfaces like laminar clean air-flow, operation table before surgery. Pour out a few drops of hand disinfectant 'HK' and rub well over hands for 30 sec. It is absolutely safe and non-toxic and can be used in the microbiology to cell culture laboratories and for practicing surgeons. It gives a healthy environment to all researchers and professionals and also a bio-safe hand wash for household and toiletries. <br><br><br><br>
