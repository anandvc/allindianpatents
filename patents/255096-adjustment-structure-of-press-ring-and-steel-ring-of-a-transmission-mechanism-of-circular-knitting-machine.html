This invention relates to an improvement for circular knitting<br>
machine and particularly a press ring adjustment structure for<br>
coupling with a steel ring set used in a circular knitting machine.<br>
It is commonly known that when the transmission mechanism<br>
(shown in FIG. 1) of a conventional circular knitting machine does<br>
not run smoothly or becomes unstable in operation, or abnormal<br>
vibration or noise occurred during the circular knitting machine<br>
operation, the problems mainly result from the wearing steel ring<br>
set 3 (i.e. there are gaps between the steel ring 3 and the frame 1,<br>
lower transmission gear 2, and press ring 4). To remedy the<br>
problems, operator has to disassemble a lower diamond ring (not<br>
shown in the figure) and the needle drum seat 5, then unfasten an<br>
adjustment element 14, and remove the press ring 4 and the existing<br>
washer 44. Then the operator has to replace a thinner new washer<br>
44 on a bulged ring 12 located in the frame 1, screw the press ring 4<br>
over the bulged ring 12 to narrow the interval between the recess 45<br>
and 15 of the press ring 4 and bulged ring 12 whereby to eliminate<br>
the gap between the steel ring set 3 and the recess 22 of the lower<br>
transmission gear 2. After all this has been done, the spindle (not<br>
shown in the figure) may drive the lower transmission gear 2 and<br>
needle drum seat 5 to operate smoothly without generating<br>
vibration or noise.<br><br>
The foregoing adjustment needs to disassemble a lot of<br>
components for replacing the washer 44 and to assemble the<br>
components again. It takes a lot of time and work.<br>
Moreover, the press ring 4, frame 1 and lower transmission gear 2<br>
also need adjustments at the same time when adjusting the steel ring<br>
set 3 to an optimal operative condition and to enable the lower<br>
transmission gear 2 running at a normal state. This is also a tedious<br>
and time-consuming process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing disadvantages, it is therefore an object of<br>
this invention to provide a novel adjustment method that does not<br>
need to disassemble any component so that the steel ring set may be<br>
adjusted rapidly to restore the circular knitting machine to normal<br>
operation.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an adjustment<br>
structure that needs only adjusting the press ring to achieve the<br>
result desired. It thus may save a lot of work and time.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an adjustment structure of press ring &amp; steel ring of a<br>
transmission mechanism for a circular knitting machine, comprising:<br>
a frame coupled with a spindle having an action zone and a<br>
bulged ring, and a first recess formed between the action zone<br>
and the bulged ring, the bulged ring being extended from one<br>
side of the action zone and having a through bore formed<br>
therein engaged with an adjustment element;<br>
a lower transmission gear located in the action zone having<br>
one side engageable with the spindle and another side formed a<br>
second recess;<br><br><br>
a steel ring set located in the first and second recess;<br>
a needle drum seat fastened to the lower transmission gear;<br>
and<br>
a press ring located above the bulged ring having an annular<br>
ring which has one end extended into the first and second<br>
recess forming a collar section to press the steel ring set and<br>
another end formed a fastening section engageable with the<br>
adjustment element, and a washer located between the annular<br>
ring and bulged ring;<br>
 wherein the press ring is caused to move by the adjustment element<br>
to release pressure of the collar section on the steel ring set for<br>
the washer be removed and replaced by another washer whereby<br>
to eliminate gaps formed between the worn steel ring set and<br>
the first and second recess to enable the transmission<br>
mechanism function normally.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention, as well as its many advantages, may be further<br>
understood by the following detailed description and drawings. The<br>
drawings are only to serve for reference and illustrative purpose,<br>
and do not intend to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
FIG.l is a fragmentary schematic view of a transmission<br>
mechanism of a conventional circular knitting machine.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic sectional view of a transmission mechanism<br>
of this invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a fragmentary sectional view of this invention, showing<br>
adjustment of the press ring and steel ring set.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, this invention aims at providing an improved<br>
press ring adjustment structure to couple with the steel ring at the<br>
transmission mechanism of a circular knitting machine for adjusting<br>
the wearing of the steel ring to ensure normal operation of the<br>
circular knitting machine.<br>
The transmission mechanism set forth above mainly includes a<br>
frame 1, a lower transmission gear 2, a steel ring set 3, a press ring<br>
4, a needle drum seat 5 and a spindle 6. The spindle 6 is located in<br>
the frame 1 which has an action zone 11 and a bulged ring 12<br>
extended from one side of the action zone 11. In the bulged ring 12,<br><br><br>
there is a through bore 13 which engages with an adjustment<br>
element 14. There is a first recess 15 formed between the action<br>
zone 11 and bulged ring 12. The lower transmission gear 2 is<br>
located in the action zone 11 and has one side engaged with the<br>
gear 21 of the spindle 6 and another side has a second recess 22.<br>
The steel ring set 3 includes a first ring 31 which has a larger<br>
diameter and a plurality of second rings 32 which has a smaller<br>
diameter. The steel ring set 3 is located between the first and second<br>
recesses 15 and 22 to function as a bearing while transmitting<br>
rotation from the spindle 6 to the lower transmission gear 2 and for<br>
the lower transmission gear 2 rotating in the action zone 11.<br>
The press ring 4 is located above the bulged ring 12 and has an<br>
annular ring 41 which has one end extended into the recesses 15<br>
and 22 to form a collar section 42 to press the steel ring set 3 to<br>
ensure that the steel ring set 3 won't get loose when the circular<br>
knitting machine is running. Another end of the annular ring 41<br>
forms a fastening section 43 engageable with the adjustment<br>
element 14. There is a washer 44 located between the annular ring<br>
41 and bulged ring 12 for controlling the pressing displacement of<br>
the press ring 4 against the steel ring set 3 to enable the circular<br>
knitting machine function normally.<br>
The needle drum seat 5 has one end fastened to the lower<br>
transmission gear 2 and may rotate when driven by the spindle 6<br>
through the lower transmission gear 2 thereby the needle drum (not<br>
shown in the figure) located on the needle drum seat 5 will also<br><br>
rotate. Coupled with the cam, the knitting needles will be raised or<br>
lowered to perform knitting operation.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, when the spindle 6 rotates, the lower<br>
transmission gear 2 is turned in the action zone 11 through the steel<br>
ring set 3, and consequently drives the needle drum seat 5 rotating<br>
to raise or lower the needles. After the lower transmission gear 2<br>
being driven by the spindle 6 to operate for a period of time, the<br>
first and second steel rings 31 and 32 will become smaller because<br>
of wearing and will result in a gap between the steel ring 3 and the<br>
first and second recesses 15 and 22. As a result, the rotation of the<br>
lower transmission gear 2 becomes unstable and will generate<br>
vibration and noise and damage the transmission mechanism of the<br>
knitting machine. To prevent this problem from happening, the<br>
adjustment element 14 may be unfastened to release the downward<br>
pressure of the press ring 4, then remove the existing washer 44 and<br>
replace it with a new and thinner washer 44 between the annular<br>
ring 41 and bulged ring 12. Then fasten the adjustment element 14<br>
again to enable the collar section 42 of the press ring 4 exerting a<br>
downward pressure on the steel ring set 3 and eliminate the gap<br>
between the steel ring set 3 and the first and second recesses 15 and<br>
22. After the replacement and adjustment, the spindle 6 may drive<br>
the lower transmission gear 2 for the circular knitting machine to<br>
resume normal operation without vibration or noise.<br>
The washer 44 may be made in a number of different thickness<br>
for replacement use depending on the wearing degree of the steel<br><br>
ring set 3. The repairs and maintenance of the circular knitting<br>
machine also may be done easier and more rapidly.<br>
It may thus be seen that the objects of the present invention set<br>
forth herein, as well as those made apparent from the foregoing<br>
description, are efficiently attained. While the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention have been set forth for purpose of<br>
disclosure, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
various other changes and modifications can be made according to<br>
the embodiment. Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to<br>
cover all embodiments which do not depart from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention.	<br><br>
