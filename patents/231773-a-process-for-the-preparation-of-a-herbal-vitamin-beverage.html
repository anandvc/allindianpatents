				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of vitamin herbal beverage with anti-freezing   properties   upto   -20°C   which   is   based   on   herb   Hippophae   spp (Seabuckthorn). PRIOR ART<br>
Herbal based compositions have been conventionally used as nutrients. Hippophae spp (Seabuckthorn) is a widely distributed herb throughout the temperate zones of Asia and Europe and throughout cold arid zones of high altitudes of Asia. In India, this genus is distributed in high altitudes of Himalayas and this genera is represented by three species namely, H. salicifolia, H. rhamnoides spp turkestanica and H. tibeiaim. In Ladakh, in India, Seabuckthorn is generally used as a fodder for grazing goats and as fuel for winters. Fruits of this plant are small sized berries, containing 65-70% juice, which is very rich in six vitamins viz- A, B1, B2, C, E and K, and bioactive substances, which act as anit-oxidant agents, improve body and skin resistance. The natural juice is highly acidic in nature with pH varying from 1.2 to about 1.6. It is not easy to consume the fruit or its juice in natural conditions.<br>
US patent No. 5,666,361 has claimed a process involving use of Seabuckthorn as an ice-nucleating agent, which is used as an additive to a food product to increase the freezing point of a food product subject to freezing temperature. US Patent No. 5,637, 301 has also claimed a process for preparation of an ice-nucleating composition, comprising of mixing berry tissue and leaf tissue of Seabuckthorn, with an aqueous solution containing a saccharide and then separating aqueous extract from solid extract to obtain aqueous extract containing ice-nucleating agent.<br>
According to US Patent No. 4,886,665, ascorbic acid (Vitamin 'C') and / or an extract of Seabuckthorn as a source of Vitamin C, is added to an oat extract and an extract of nettle to provide a powder mix for use as a food supplement or powder mix is further mixed with colloidal silica etc to provide a pharmaceutical composition in the form of powder, capsules, tablets, for treatment or prevention of various dysfunctions of human body. The composition can also be obtained in the form of nasal gels, drops or syrups, ointments etc. by mixing the powder mix with excipients.<br>
However, no patent is reported on processing of the natural juice of the berries of Seabuckthorn so as to prepare a vitamin rich beverage with good taste, suitable for direct consumption by human beings, without adding any artificial colouring, flavouring or stabilizing agents. <br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of pure herbal vitamin beverage based on natural juice of herb 'Seabuckthorn' containing the major vitamins.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of herb based multi vitamin beverage, which has a shelf life of two years in high altitude areas and one year in other areas.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a<br>
process for the preparation of herbal based vitamin beverage,<br>
which does not freeze even at temperatures upto minus 200C<br>
and  thus  remains  in the beverage  form in the  freezing temperatures in high altitude areas.<br>
Further object of the invention is to propose a process for the preparation of herbal based vitamin beverage, which<br>
does  not contain any artificial  colour,  flavour or any chemical.<br>
Yet further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of herbal based vitamin beverage,<br>
which  has  suitable  taste  for  direct  consumption  as  a beverage.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of herbal vitamin beverage based on the fruits of herb Hippophae spp (Seabuckthorn) which comprises in the step of preparing sugar solution by mixing water and sugar in the ratio of 1:1.75 to 2.5 wherein the said sugar solution contains 10-30 wt % of fructose and 70-90wt% of cane sugar, mixing juice of Seabuckthorn and sugar solution in the ratio of 1:1, heating the mixture at 32° to 52°C to prevent the loss of natural vitamins, colours or flavour homogenisition, filtration and adding preservative selected from Potassium Metabisulphite, Sodium Benzoate, preferably Potassium Metabisulphite.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the herbal nutritional multivitamin beverage is based on the fruits of herb Hippophae spp (Seabuckthorn), is prepared by a process which consists of washing ripe "Seabuckthorn" berries with luke warm water and extracting juice with the help of a suitable juicer. One kg of fresh fruit yields approx 600-750 ml of fresh juice. To make the beverage from its one litre of juice, sugar syrup is prepared separately by addition of approx 1.75 to 2.25 kg of sugar (10-30% fructose + 70-90% cane sugar) in one litre of water preferably the ratio of water and sugar is 1: 1.75 to 2.5. This solution is heated properly for complete mixing of sugar with water and then filtered properly. Thereafter, the sugar syrup is added with 1.0 litre of fresh filtered Seabuckthorn natural juice preferably the ratio of sugar solution and Seabuckthorn juice is 1:1. This mixture is then heated to a temperature of 32° to 52°C, so that vitamins or natural colour or its natural flavour is not destroyed. The solution is then homogenised and filtered. This is followed by addition of a suitable food grade preservative like Potassium Metabisulphite @ 1.5-2.5g per litre of natural juice to yield 350 ppm SO2 in the final product. The prepared beverage is thereafter packed in bottles or suitable pouches and then labeled and stored.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be illustrated with a working <br>
example which is intended to be an<br>
illustrative  example  and  is  not  intended  to  be  taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention. <br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
One litre of fresh extracted juice of Seabuckthorn berries is taken in a vessel. A sugar syrup is prepared separately by mixing of 1000 ml of water with approx 2.00 kg of sugar mixture, having approx 30% fructose and 70% cane sugar. The fresh juice of Seabuckthorn is then mixed in the<br>
sugar syrup. The solution is then heated to a temperature of approx 40°C. The solution is homogenised and filtered and approx 2.00 g of food grade preservative is added. The beverage is then ready for bottling/pouches.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes and<br>
adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modifications,       <br>
changes and adaptations are intended to be within the scope        <br>
of the present invention, which is further set forth under <br>
the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
