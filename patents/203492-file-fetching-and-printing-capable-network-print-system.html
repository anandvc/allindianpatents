FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of Data Communication and printing documents using Network Printers or Network Multifunctional Peripherals (MFP). Further this invention relates to a file fetching and printing capable network print system. More particularly this invention relates to print system capable of fetching files from a remote file server In electronic format through a file transfer protocol and printing it after conversion to printable format,<br>
PRESENT STATE OF ART<br>
Presently printing jobs are initiated from the PC and uses methods like TCP/IP printing, IPX/SPX printing etc. In PC initiated printing, when a print job is submitted, it is communicated to a port monitor residing on the PC, which establishes a connection with the printer and then transfers data to the printer over the network. Once the printer port receives the data, it sends it for printing.<br>
These methods of sending data over the network to the printer use standardized protocols like TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and DLC. None of the network printers support any standard file transfer protocol as a means of transferring a document over the network to a print system for printing.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Using current network printers and multifunction peripherals, it is not possible to fetch an electronic document from a server by issuing request from the printer itself and then print it. The print request has to be initiated from the PC or device having the document. Also documents stored at a centralized server need to be downloaded to a PC first and then printed.<br><br>
This present invention proposes to overcome tine limitation of the conventional and the existing print system by allowing users to retrieve and print documents from the network printer or IVIFP using a file transfer protocol.<br>

It is another object of the invention to access files from remote server based on user input initiated from the printer system itself.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method by which the retrieval and printing of documents on the print system can be scheduled by taking time of retrieval as user input.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a method to retrieve files from file servers by issuing a request from a network print system; the retrieved file in electronic format is then converted to a printable format on the network print device and then sent to the print subsystem to get a hard copy. The request to retrieve the file and the related information can be provided from an interface device (like an alphanumeric keyboard, touch screen etc.) connected to the network print device; The request for retrieval of file and related info can also be initiated from a network enabled personal computer over a data network.<br><br>

The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1: represents a block diagram of network architecture of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2: represents a block diagram of various sub modules of the present invention and their links in understanding of the present invention.<br>
Figures 3 to 5: represents the sequential order of operations of the disclosed invention and the data flow charts wherein A, B and C shown in circles represents the continuity of the proposed data flow. These figures are self explanatory in their presentations.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a file fetching and printing capable network system wherein the data flow among different sub modules interacting between the different network components in the data network allow only the authorised users to retrieve files by issuing request from printer, from a remote server in electronic format and later obtaining the hard copy in a desired format<br>
Before going into the operations of various sub-modules, it is pertinent to understand the invention first by looking into the details of the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that the explanations given under the accompanying drawings however does not limit the scope of the invention,<br>
Refereeing to Figure 1 the MFP/Printer is connected to a data network through a wired or wireless interface. The diagram also shows a remote file server, which stores files in electronic format, a print service provider which can convert files in electronic format to a printable format and a network enabled personal computer which can interface with the print system or MFP, The MFP/Printer retrieves files from the remote file server over the data network. The MFP/ Printer can also access the Print Service Provider over the data network in order to convert a file in some electronic format to a printable format.<br>
Refereeing to Figure 2 the proposed print system scheme comprising the sub modules of the print system and various network components in the data network. The diagram outlines the data flow between different sub modules and<br>
the interaction between the different network components in the data network.<br>
/<br>
The print system block comprises the following: -<br>
•	A print sub system, which takes files in printable format and produces a hard copy.<br>
•	An  interface device,  which  is  used,  for accepting  user requests e.g. alphanumeric keyboard.<br>
•	A sub module having two interfaces designated as Intf 1, Intf 2.<br>
Intf 1 accepts user requests as input through the user interface device.<br><br>
Intf 2 is the interface, which accepts user requests from a Personal Computer over the data network. This sub module enables establishment of connection to the file server, retrieval of requested files, storing the retrieved files in memory and disconnecting from the server.<br>
The retrieval of files from the file server is through a standard File Transfer Protocol. The file server can be any one of the various platforms like Windows, Linux, Solaris etc.<br>
•	A document conversion module responsible for converting the retrieved file from the file server in electronic format to a printable format.<br>
•	The retrieved documents can also be converted to printable format through print service provider over the data network as shown in the block diagram.<br>
•	The network interface module shown in the diagram is an interface meant for sending and receiving data over the network. This module can be connected to the data network through either a wired or a wireless interface.<br>
Figure 3 is a data flow diagram showing how a user request for retrieving a file from the file server is accepted. The user interface device is used to take the user request and file retrieval information like filename and path, server address, user account and password. The user input interface device can be an alphanumeric keyboard or a touch screen or similar interface. Alternatively, the user request and file retrieval information can be input from a personal computer and sent to the print sub system over the data network. As shown in the data flow diagram, the printer display is checked to see whether, there is input from the user interface(s) and if 'Yes', the file retrieval information is fetched.<br>
Figure 4 is a data flow diagram for retrieving the file from the file server. The sub module first checks if the printer is free for printing. If it is not free, it displays an error message and exits from the session. If printer is free, it is locked for the session.<br>
The module then establishes connection with the file server, authenticates using the  user supplied  account and  password  and then  issues a file  retrieve<br><br>
command to the server.<br>
The module opens a data channel and waits on it for the incoming file from the server. The file data is stored in memory.<br>
This step is continued till complete file is received. Then the print system disconnects with the server.<br>
Figure 5 is a data flow diagram of the printing of the retrieved file after converting it to a printable format.<br>
The file retrieve sub module signals the file format conversion module once the complete file is received on the print system. The file retrieve module passes the memory address where the file is stored. The file format sub module reads the file from memory and decides whether the file format is supported by the print system, i.e. whether the file can be converted to printable format locally or not. If yes, then it further checks whether the file needs to be converted or not. If it has to be converted, it uses software modules to convert it to a printable format and sends the data to the print subsystem for printing. If it can be printed directly, then the file is directly sent to the print subsystem for printing.<br>
In case the file format cannot be converted locally, the file format module connects to the print service provider over the data network. The file is sent to the print service provider, which converts it to a printable format and sends it back to the print system over the data network. The file format convert module then sends the file, converted to a printable format, to the print subsystem for printing.<br>
Once the file is printed successfully, the file is deleted from the system memory. Structure of the Invention:<br>
The invention comprises a network print system connected to a data network through a wired or wireless interface.<br>
The print system comprises of the following sub modules:<br><br>
•	An interface device with User Interface (e.g. alphanumeric keyboard, touch screen and the like), used to get user request and file access information.<br>
•	Module to connect to file server over data network and retrieve the file in electronic format. This module also accepts user input from the user interface device or over the data network from a PC<br>
•	Module to convert the file in electronic format to a printable format.<br>
•	Print subsystem to print the retrieved file after conversion to printable format.<br>
•	The print system communicates over the data network with a Print Service Provider in order to convert files In electronic format to printable format. This is done when the file cannot be converted to printable format locally on the print system.<br>
Operation of the Invention:<br>
The operation of the proposed print system scheme is as follows:<br>
•	The user inputs request for file retrieval information through user interface device like alphanumeric keyboard.<br>
•	The user-input request can also be initiated from a PC over the data network.<br>
•	The print system sub module connects to the file server whose address is input by the user. The sub module then authenticates with the file server and issues command to retrieve file whose name is supplied by the user through the user interface. A data channel is opened for file access and once file retrieval is over, disconnection from file server takes place. The retrieved file is available in memory of the print system. The sub module then signals the file format conversion module to fetch the file from memory and convert it to printable format. The format conversion module checks whether there is a<br><br>
need to convert it to printable format. If the file can be directly printed, it is sent to print sub system where hard copy is taken. Otherwise, the file is converted to printable format locally in the print system and then printed. Upon successful completion of printing, the file is deleted from the memory. If the file cannot be converted locally, the file is sent to print service provider over the data network, gets converted and received in the print system for printing of hard copy.<br>
Any standard file transfer protocol (FTP, TFPT etc) is used for transferring of data over the data network. This scheme is platform independent as FTP,TFPT etc. can be used with file servers running on Windows, Linux, Solaris etc.<br>
By having a File transfer server running on the IP enabled MFP/ Printer, it is possible to send a file in electronic format from any PC to the print system for printing. In this case a user logs on to the server on the print system using a guest login (anonymous login), sends the file to the print system, which converts it to a printable format and then prints it. This is an alternate method of network printing from PC clients.<br>
The user input can also be stored on the print system as address book entries. This eliminates the need for the user to enter the server address, user account and password every time he/she wants to retrieve and print a file from that file server.<br>
The retrieval and printing of documents on the print system can be scheduled by taking the time of retrieval as a user input. An internal clock on the print system can be used to trigger the file retrieval and printing process when that time is reached.<br>
The operation of the proposed invention is divided into two basic categories i.e. method for issuing user request and method to retrieve and print the file, which have been explained as follows :<br>
Method for issuing user request:<br><br>
User uses the interface device to give the file retrieval request. The user enters the file server address, the account name and password for authentication with the server and the file path and name.<br>
Alternatively, the user gives the file retrieval request and the other information from his personal computer and the information are communicated to the print system over a data network.<br>
Method to retrieve and print file:<br>
•	The print system sub module connects to the file server whose address is input by the user.<br>
•	The sub module then authenticates with the file server and issues command to retrieve the file whose name is supplied by the user.<br>
•	The sub module opens a data channel and waits for the file data on that channel.<br>
•	Once the complete file is retrieved by this module, it disconnects from the file server.<br>
•	This sub module then signals the file format conversion module to take the file from memory and convert it to a printable format.<br>
•	The format conversion module checks if the file can be printed directly or needs to be converted to printable format.<br>
•	If file can be directly printed, it is sent to the print subsystem which produces a hardcopy of the file and then deletes it from memory, once successfully printed.<br>
•	If file format is to be converted, the sub module checks whether the conversion can be done locally through some software module.<br>
•	If yes, the file is converted to printable format and then sent to print subsystem for printing. Once successfully printed, the file is deleted from memory.<br>
•	If file cannot be converted locally, the format conversion module connects to a print service provider over a data network.<br>
•	The file is sent to the print service provider over the data network.<br>
•	The print service provider converts the file to a printable format and sends it back to the file convert module of the print system.<br>
•	The file in converted format is then sent to the phnt subsystem for printing. Once<br><br>
successfully printed, the file is deleted from memory.<br>
