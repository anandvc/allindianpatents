				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the detection of Aspergillus ochraceus bv biotechnological approach. This invention particularly relates to the development of a process for the detection of species belonging to Aspergillus ochraceus group by PCR/ multiplex PCR technique. More particularly the present invention relates to a set of novel oligonucleotide primers and the method for the detection of Ajpergillus ochraceus thereby.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Aspergillus ochraceus group of fungi belonging to Genus Aspergillus section Circumdati are known to produce the mycotoxin ochratoxin A. Ochratoxins belong to pentaketide group of mycotoxins, which consists of isocoumarin molecule linked to phenylalanine through, amide linkage (Vander Merwe et al, 1965). Ochratoxins are known nephrotoxic agent, apart from that they have teratogenic, immunosuppressive and carcinogenic properties (Krogh, et al 1992). It has also been classified as possible human carcinogen (group 2B) by international agency of cancer (Kuiper Godman, et al., 1996).<br>
Ochratoxin A was initially known to be produced by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilhelm and Penicillium verrucossum (Pitt, 1987: Ciegler, 1992). But later studies have shown that other species of Aspergillus ochraceus group - Aspergillus melleus, A. sulphureus, A. sclerotiorum, ^ auricomus, A. alliaceus and A. ostianus (Varga et al., 1996) as ochratoxin A producer. Aspergillus ochraceus group of fungi is widely distributed in dried foods like beans, dried fruits, nuts including peanuts, betal nuts, wide range of cereals including barley, wheat flour and rice (Pitt and Hocking, 1985: Varga et al, 1996). Aspergillus ochraceus has been considered principle organism responsible for ochratoxin A contamination in tropical region and Penicillium verrucossum as the principle organism responsible for ochratoxin A contamination in temperate regions (Pitt, 1987).<br>
Mycotoxigenic fungi are widely distributed in various food commodities and mycotoxins contribute to loss of about 25% food grains produced globally. The level of fungal infestation ariU identification of the governing species are important parameters, which would give an indication of the quality of the material and future potential for the presence of Ochratoxins. Mold counts are a part of quality control assurance for foods. This method is time consuming, labour intensive, costly, requires facilities, and mycological expertise. In this direction, DNA-based detection<br>
method like PCR is more sensitive, specific and has been employed for the detection of various pathogenic and mycotoxigenic fungi.<br>
Sequence variations in the rDNA gene have been used for phylogenetic studies and various primers have been designed for specific detection of various organisms. The main reasons for the popularity of rDNA are that it is a multiple-copy, non-protein coding gene and are present in all organisms with a common evolutionary origin. Fungal rRNA genes are organized in units each of which encodes three mature subunits of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S respectively. Two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2 separate these subunits (White et al., 1990). The ITS regions are generally used for differentiation at the species level Josep et al (1999). The 18S rDNA is known evolve relatively slow compared to internal transcribed spacers and therefore suitable for development of genus or group level probes.<br>
References may be made to the work of Wu, et al (2003) wherein 33 oligonucleotide probes designed based on the sequence variation in 18S rRNA gene has been reported as genus or species specific. The probes Asp-3 and Asp-4 have been reported as specific to Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, and A. versicolor but could not differentiate among these species.<br>
References may be made to the work of Johanson et al (1998), wherein they have reported PCR method for detection of Rhizoctonia solani, R oryzae and R, oryzae sativa using specific primers designed based on the sequence variation in ITS 1 and ITS2 region among these species.<br>
References may be made to the work of Zur et al (2003) wherein they have reported oligonucleotide primers specific for Alternaria alternata and Alternata solani based on sequence variation in the sequence of ITS 1 and ITS2 region.<br>
References may be made to the work of Accensi et al (1999), wherein a PCR method has been described to differentiate A. niger from A. tubingensis based on variation of single nucleotick in ITS region of these species.<br>
References may be made to the work of Colombo et al (2003) wherein they have described method for detection of Penicillium auratiogriseum based on sequence variation in ITS1 and ITS2 region which can be differentiated from other fungal species by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique.<br>
References may be made to the work of Sandhu et al (1995) wherein they have reported 21 oligonucleotide probes specific for A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. glaucus and A. terreus spp ofAspergillus. Their list do not include A. ochraceus group.<br>
References may be made to the work of Martin et al (2000) wherein they have reported oligonucleotide probes for detection of fungal pathogens by PCR based line probe assay (LIPA). They have reported method for detection of A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. versicolor and ,4. nidulans.<br>
The drawbacks of these references are that no attempts have been made for specific detection of Aspergillus ochraceus species and the traditional methods are less sensitive, time-consuming and lack consistency. The present invention enables the detection of Aspergillus ochraceus species by PCR, using primer specific for 18S rRNA gene. This method has application in detection of ochratoxin producing Aspergillus ochraceus in food system.<br>

The patent relates to PCR/ multiplex PCR method for detection of ochratoxin A producing species of Aspergillus ochraceus fungi such as Aspergillus ochraceus, A. melleus, A. sulphureus, A. sderotiorum, A. auricomus, A. alliaceus and A. ostianus. Polymerase chain reaction was used to selectively amplify 18S rRNA gene of Aspergillus ochraceus and related species. Aspergillus ochraceus species grown on a semi-synthetic medium was used for the isolation of template DNA. The PCR reaction mixture and amplification conditions were optimized for specific amplification. Visualization of PCR products revealed that by the method followed, it is possible to specifically detect Aspergillus ochraceus species isolated from different sources.<br>
The novelty of this method is the use of the designed primers for the detection of Aspergillus ochraceus species by PCR and multiplex PCR. The PCR method is rapid and sensitive making it possible to detect Aspergillus ochraceus group of fungi isolated from varied food sources.<br>

Template DNA was initially denatured at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Subsequently a total of 30 amplification cycles was carried out in a programmable thermocycler with an initial 8 cycles each with a denaturation for 30 sec at 94°C, primer annealing for 45 seconds at 70°C, extension for 75 seconds at 72°C followed by 22 cycles each with a ienaturation for 30 sec at 94°C, primer annealing for 45 seconds at 60°C, extension for 75 seconds at 72°C and final extension for 8 minutes at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed by standard procedure using agarose gel electrophoresis. Gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5ng/ml), destained with distilled water and examined on a UV-transilluminator. A 100 bp ladder was used as a molecular size marker. The amplification profile of the gel was documented in a CCD-Camera based gel documentation system.
