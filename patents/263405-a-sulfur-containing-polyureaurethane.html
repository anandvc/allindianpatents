[0002] The present invention relates to sulfur-containing<br>
polyureaurethanes and methods for their'preparation,<br>
[0003] A nijmber of organic polymeric materials, such as<br>
plastics, have been developed as alternatives and replacements<br>
for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber<br>
optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation<br>
transparencies. These polymeric materials can provide<br>
advantages relative to glass, including, shatter resistance,<br>
lighter weight for a given application, ease of molding and<br>
ease of dying. However, the refractive indices of many<br>
polymeric materials are generally lower than that of glass.<br>
In ophthalmic applications, the use of a polymeric material<br>
liaving a lower refractive index will require a thicker lens<br>
relative to a material having a higher refractive index. A<br>
thicker lens is not desirable.<br>
[0004] Thus, there is a need in the art to develop a<br>
polymeric material having an adequate refractive index and<br>
good impact resistance/strength.<br>
WO2007/09779G ¥erffi9mmUM9.<br>
[0005] The present invention is directed to a sulfurcontaining<br>
polyureaurethane when at least partially cvired<br>
having a refractive index of at least 1.55, or at least 1.56,<br>
or at least 1.57, or at least 1.58, or at least 1.59, or at<br>
least 1.60, or at least 1.62, or at least 1.65; an Abbe number<br>
of at least 32 and a density of at least 1.0, or at least 1.1,<br>
or less than 1.2 grams/cm', or less than 1.3 grams/cm^.<br>
[0006] As used herein and the claims, curing of a<br>
polymerizable composition refers to subjecting said<br>
composition to curing conditions such as but not limited to<br>
thermal curing, leading to the reaction of the reactive endgroxips<br>
of said composition, and resulting in polymerization<br>
and formation of a solid polymerizate. When a polymerizable<br>
composition is subjected to curing conditions, following<br>
polymerization amd after reaction of most of the reactive end<br>
groups occurs, the rate of reaction of the remaining vmreacted<br>
reactive end groups becomes progressively slower. In a nonlimiting<br>
embodiment, the polymerizcible composition can be<br>
subjected to curing conditions until it is at least partially<br>
cured. The teirm "at least partially cured" means subjecting<br>
the polymerizable composition to curing conditions, wherein<br>
reaction of at least a portion of the reactive end-groups of<br>
said composition occurs, to form a solid polymerizate, such<br>
that said polymerizate can be deraolded, and cut into test<br>
pieces, or such that it may be subjected to machining<br>
operations, including optical lens processing.<br>
[0007] In a non-limiting embodiment, the polymerizable<br>
composition can be subjected to curing conditions, such that a<br>
stibstantially complete cure is attained and wherein further<br>
curing results in no significant further improvement in<br>
polymer properties, such as hardness.<br>
[0008] For the purposes of this specification, unless<br>
otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of<br>
ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the<br>
specification and claims are to be understood as being<br>
modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly,<br>
unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set<br>
•^O 2667/097798 rCTAJS2006/01(;()ifl,<br>
forth in the following- specification and attached claims are<br>
approximations that may vary depending upon the desired<br>
properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At<br>
the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application<br>
of the doctrine of ecpiivalents to the scope of the claims,<br>
each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light<br>
of the number of reported significant digits and by applying<br>
ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[00091 Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges emd<br>
parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are<br>
approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific<br>
examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical<br>
value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily<br>
resulting from the standard deviation found in.their<br>
respective testing measurements.<br>
[0010] In a non-limiting embodiment, the sulfur-containing<br>
polyureaurethane of the present invention can be prepared by<br>
combining polyisocyanate and/or polyisothiocyanate; active<br>
hydrogen-containing material, and amine-containing curing<br>
agent.<br>
[0011] As used herein and the claims, the terms<br>
"isocyainate" and "isothiocyanate" include \inblocked compounds<br>
capable of forming a covalent bond with a reactive group such<br>
as a thiol, hydroxyl, or amine functiorial group. In alternate<br>
non-limiting embodiments, the polyisocyanate of the present<br>
invention can contain at least two fionctional groups chosen<br>
from isocyanate (NCO), the polyisothiocyanate can contain at<br>
least two functional groups chosen from isothiocyanate (NCS),<br>
and the isocyanate and isothiocyanate materials can each<br>
include combinations of isocyanate and isothiocyanate<br>
functional groups.<br>
[0012] In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
polyureaurethane of the invention when polymerized can produce<br>
a polymerizate having a refractive index of at least 1.55, or<br>
at least 1.56, or at least 1.57, or at least 1.58, or at least<br>
1.59, or at least 1.60, or at least 1.62, or at least 1.65.<br>

a polymerizate having an Abbe number of at least 32, or at<br>
least 35, or at least 38, or at least 39, or at least 40, or<br>
at least 44. The refractive index and Abbe number can be<br>
determined by methods known in the art such as American<br>
Standard Test Method (ASTM) Number D 542-00. Further, the<br>
refractive index and Abbe number can be determined using<br>
various known instruments. In a non-limiting embodiment of<br>
the present invention,' the refractive index and Abbe number<br>
can be measured in accordance with ASTM D 542-00 with the<br>
following exceptions: (i) test one to two samples/specimens<br>
instead of the minimum of three specimens specified in Section I<br>
7.3; and (ii) test the samples unconditioned instead of<br>
conditioning the samples/specimens prior to testing as<br>
specified in Section 8.1. Further, in a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, an Atago, model DR-M2 Multi-Wavelength Digital |<br>
Abbe Refractometer can be used to measure the refractive index<br>
and Abbe number of the samples/specimens.<br>

The nature of the SH group of polythiols is such that<br>
oxidative coupling can occur readily, leading to formation of<br>
disulfide linkages. Various oxidizing agents can lead to such<br>
oxidative coupling. The oxygen in the air can in some cases<br>
lead to such oxidative coupling during storage of the<br>
polythiol. It is believed that a possible mechanism for the<br>
coupling of thiol groups involves the formation of thiyl<br>
radicals, followed by coupling of said thiyl radicals, to form<br>
disulfide linkage. It is further believed that formation of<br>
disulfide linkage can occur under conditions that can lead to<br>
the formation of thiyl radical, including but not limited to<br>
reaction conditions involving free radical initiation.<br>

lOOlll] The reaction of at least one polythiol and two or<br>
more different dienes can be carried out under a variety of<br>
reaction conditions. In alternate non-limiting embodiments,<br>
such conditions can depend on the degree of reactivity of the<br>

together while heating the mixture. In a further non-limiting<br>
embodiment, polythiol and radical initiator cein be combined<br>
together and added in relatively small amounts over a period<br>
of time to a mixture of two or more dienes.<br>
[00112] In another non-limiting embodiment, two or more<br>

under radical initiation.<br>
[00113] In another non-limiting embodiment, polythiol can be<br>

the diene and polythiol and optionally free radical initiator<br>
can be allowed to react and then a second diene can be added<br>
to the mixture, followed by addition of the radical initiator<br>
to the mixture. The mixture is allowed to react until the<br>
double bonds are essentially consumed and a pre-calculated<br>

can be present in an amount of from 0.01 to 5.0% by weight of<br>
the reaction mixture. The reaction of the acrylic monomers<br>
with polythiol in the presence of a base catalyst can<br>
sxobstantially minimize or essentially preclude double bond<br>
polymerization.<br>
[00117] In another non-limiting embodiment, in order to<br>
substantially minimize or essentially preclude dotible bond<br>
polymerization, acrylic double bonds can be first reacted with<br>
polythiol tinder basic catalysis conditions and then, electronrich<br>
reactive doxible bond dienes can be added to the<br>

it is believed that as the mixture of polythiol, dienes and<br>
radical intiator is heated, the double bonds are at least<br>
partially consumed by reaction with the SH groups of the<br>
polythiol. The mixture can be heated for a sufficient period<br>
of time such that the double bonds are essentially consumed<br>
and a pre-calculated theoretical value for SH content is<br>

embodiment, the mixture can be heated until a theoretical<br>
value for SH content of from 0.7% to 17% is reached.<br>
[00119] The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the<br>
resulting polythiol oligomer can vary widely. The number<br>
average molecular weight (M„) of polythiol oligomer can be<br>
predicted based on the-stoichiometry of the reaction. In<br>
alternate non-limiting embodiments, the M„ of polythiol<br>
oligomer can vary from 400 to 10,000 g/mole, or from 1000 to<br>
3000 g/mole.<br>
[00120] The viscosity of the resulting polythiol oligomer<br>
can vary widely. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
viscosity can be from 40 cP to 4000 cP at 73°C,.or from 40 cP<br>

mercaptoethylsulfide (DMDS) and a radical initiator (such as<br>
Vazo 52) can be mixed together, and this mixture can be added<br>
dropwise to the mixture of dienes at a rate such that a<br>
temperature of SO^C is not exceeded. After the addition is<br>
completed, the mixture can be heated to maintain a temperature<br>
of eo^C until the double bonds are essentially consumed and the<br>
pre-calculated theoretical value for SH content is reached.<br>

polythiol with two or more dienes, wherein said dienes can be<br>

at least 40, wherein said dienes contain doiible bonds capable<br>
of reacting with SH groups of polythiol, and forming covalent<br>
C-S bonds; and wherein the stoichiometric ratio of the sum of<br>
the number of equivalents of all polythiols present to the sum<br>
of the number of equivalents of all dienes present is greater<br>

[00124] As previously stated herein, tthe nature of the SH<br>
group of polythiols is such that oxidative coupling ccin occur<br>
readily, leading to formation of disulfide linkages. Various<br>
mo 2007/097798- PeT/US2006/046649<br>
oxidizing agents can lead to such oxidative coupling. The<br>
oxygen in the air Ccui in some cases lead to such oxidative<br>
coupling during storage of the polythiol. It is believed that<br>
a possible mechanism for the coupling of thiol groups involves<br>
the formation of thiyl radicals, followed by coupling of said<br>
thiyl radicals, to form disulfide linkage. It is further<br>
believed that formation of disulfide linkage can occur under<br>
conditions that can lead to the formation of thiyl radical,<br>
including but not limited to reaction conditions involving<br>
free radical initiation.<br>

additives can include 3-methyl-2-butenol, organo<br>
pyrocarbonates and triphenyl phosphite (CAS registry no. 101-<br>
02-0). Such additives can be present in an amount such that<br>
the additive constitutes less th2in 10 percent by weight, or<br>
less than 5 percent by weight, or less than 3 percent by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the prepolymer. In<br>
alternate non-limiting embodiments, the aforementioned<br>
optional additives can be mixed with the polyisocyanate and/or<br>
polyisothiocyanate. In a further non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
optional additives can be mixed with active hydrogencontaining<br>
material.<br>
[00157] In a non-limiting embodiment', the resulting sulfurcontaining<br>
polyureaurethane of the present invention when at<br>
least partially cured can be solid and essentially transparent<br>
such that it is suitable for optical or ophthalmic<br>
applications. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
sulfur-containing polyvireaurethane can have a refractive index<br>
of at least 1.55, or at least 1.56, or at least 1.57, or at<br>
least 1.58, or at least 1.59, or at least 1.60, or at least<br>

embodiments, the sulfur-containing polyureaurethane can have<br>
an Abbe number of at least 32, or at least 35, or at least 38,<br>
or at least 39, or at least 40, or at least 44.<br>
[00158] In a non-limiting embodiment, the sulfur-containing<br>
polyureaurethane when polymerized and at least partially cured<br>
iHfO lOQimntS -rCT/U32006/046649<br>
can demonstrate good impact resistance/strength. Impact<br>
resistance caji be measured using a variety of conventional<br>
methods known to one skilled in the art. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the impact resistance is measured using the Impact<br>
Energy Test which consists of testing a flat sheet sample of<br>
polymerizate having a thicknes's of 3mm, and cut into a square<br>
piece approximately 4cm x 4cm. The flat sheet sample of<br>
polymerizate is supported on a flat 0-ring which is attached<br>
to top of the pedestal, of a steel holder, as defined below.<br>
The O-ring is constructed of neoprene having a hardness of 40<br>
+_ 5 Shore A durometer, a minimum tensile strength of 8.3 MPa,<br>
and a minimum ultimate elongation of 400 percent, and has an<br>
inner diameter of 25 mm, an outer diameter of 31 mm, and a<br>
thickness of 2.3 mm. The. steel holder consists of a steel<br>
base, with a mass of approximately 12 kg, and a steel pedestal<br>
affixed to the steel base. The shape of said steel pedestal<br>
is approximated by the solid shape which would result from<br>
adjoining onto the top of a cylinder, having an outer diameter<br>
of 75 mm and a height of 10 mm, the frustum of a right<br>
circular cone, having a bottom diameter of 75 mm, a top<br>
diameter of 25 mm, and a height of 8 mm, wherein the center of<br>
said frustum coincides with the center of said cylinder. The<br>
bottom of said steel pedestal is affixed to said steel base,<br>
and the neoprene O-ring is affixed to the top of the steel<br>
pedestal, with the center of said O-ring coinciding with the<br>
center of the steel pedestal. The flat sheet sample of<br>
polymerizate is set on top of the O-ring with the center of<br>
said flat sheet sample coinciding with the center of said Oring.<br>
The Impact Energy Test is carried out by dropping steel<br>
balls of increasing weight from a distance of 50 inches (1.27<br>
meters) onto the center of the flat sheet sample. The sheet<br>
is determined to have passed the test if the sheet does not<br>
fracture. The sheet is determined to have failed the test<br>
when the sheet fractures. As used herein, the term "fracture"<br>
refers to a crack through the entire thickness of the sheet<br>
into two or more separate pieces, or detachment of one or more<br>
pieces of material from the backside of the sheet (i.e., the<br>
AVO 2007/097798" i'CT/US200(i/046(&gt;49-<br>
side of the sheet opposite the side of impact). The impact<br>
strength of the sheet is reported as the impact energy that<br>
corresponds to the highest level (i.e., largest ball) at which<br>
the sheet passes the test, and it is calculated acording to<br>
the following formula:<br>
E=mgd<br>
wherein E represent impact energy in Joules (J), m represents<br>
mass of the ball in kilograms (kg), g represents acceleration<br>
due to gravity (i.e., 9.80665 m/sec') and d represents the<br>
distance of the ball drop in meters (i.e., 1.27 m). In an<br>
alternate non-limiting embodiment, using the Impact Energy<br>
Test as described herein, the impact strength can be at least<br>
2.0 joules, or at least 4.95 joules.<br>
[00159] In another non-limiting emobidment, the sulfurcontaining<br>
polyureaurethane of the present invention when at<br>
least partially cured can have low density. In alternate nonlimiting<br>
embodiments, the density can be at least 1.0, or at<br>
least 1.1 g/cm^, or less than 1.3, or less than 1.25, or less<br>
than 1.2 g/cm% or from 1.0 to 1.2 grams/cm^ or from 1.0 to<br>
1.25 grams/cm^, or from 1.0 to less than 1.3 grams/cra^. In a<br>
non-limiting embodiment, the density is measured using a<br>
DensiTECH instrument manufactured by Tech Pro, Incorporated in<br>
accordance with ASTM D297.<br>
[00160] Solid articles that can be prepared using the<br>
sulfur-containing polyureaurethane of the present invention<br>
include but are not limited to optical lenses, such as piano<br>
and ophthalmic lenses, svm lenses, windows, automotive<br>
transparencies, such as windshields, sidelights and<br>
backlights, and aircraft transparencies.<br>
[00161] In a non-limiting embodiment, the sulfur-containing<br>
polyureaurethane polyirierizate of the present invention can be<br>
used to prepare photochromic articles, such as lenses. In a<br>
further embodiment, the polymerizate can be transparent to<br>
that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which activates<br>
the photochromic substance(s), i.e., that wavelength of<br>
ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the colored or open form<br>
of the photochromic s\abstance and that portion of the visible<br>
AVO 2007/097798- FCT/US2006/046649<br>
spectrum that includes the absorption maximum wavelength of<br>
the photochromic siibstance in its UV activated form, i.e., the<br>
open form.<br>
[00162] A wide variety of photochromic substances ccoi be<br>
used in the present invention. Suitable photochromic<br>
substances, suitable amoxints thereof, and methods of<br>
incorporation into the polymerizate are described in WO<br>
2004/060951 Al at [00151] to [00161], incorporated herein byreference<br>
.<br>
[00163] In another embodiment, the photochromic svibstance<br>
can be added to the sulfur-containing polyureaurethane prior<br>
to polymerizing and/or.cast curing the material. In this<br>
embodiment, the photochromic substance used can be chosen such<br>
that it is resistant to potentially adverse interactions with,<br>
for example, the isocyanate, isothiocyante and amine groups<br>
present. Such adverse interactions can result in deactivation<br>
of the photochromic siobstance, for example, by trapping them<br>
in either an open or closed form.<br>

equipped with thermometer, using a magnetic stirrer, were<br>
mixed 48.0 grams (0.4 mole) of VNB and 28.4 grams (0.2 mole)<br>
of (BDDVE). The flask was emersed in an oil bath having a<br>
temperature between 40-'42°C. With slight heating, 0.4O0 grams<br>
(0.5%) Vazo 52 radical initiator (2,2'-azobis(2,4-<br>
dimethylpentanenitrile, obtained from DuPont) was dissolved in<br>
107.8 grams (0.7 mole) of DMDS. This solution was charged in<br>
a dropping funnel and the solution was added drop-wise to the<br>
mixture of two dienes. The reaction was exothermic and the<br>
temperature of the mixture did not exceed 60*'C. After the<br>
addition was completed (total addition time was 4 hours), the<br>
temperature of the oil bath was increased to a temperature of<br>
60°C and the mixture was- stirred at this temperature for 16<br>
hours. The temperature was then increased to 75°C and the<br>
mixture was stirred for another 4 hours. The SH analysis was<br>
conducted and showed SHEW (SH (mercaptan) equivalent weight)<br>
of 894. The mixture was stirred at a temperature of 6Q°C for<br>
another 24 hours. The SH analysis was conducted and showed<br>
SHEW of 896. The M„ for the oligomeric mixture was calculated<br>
based on SHEW as 1792. The measured refractive index nn (at<br>
20'C) was 1.606 and the viscosity of the mixture at 73°C was<br>
993 cP.<br>
[00214] The mixture slowly crystallized upon cooling to room<br>
temperature but melted again upon heating with essentially no<br>
change in the SH content or the viscosity.<br>

7-ene (DBU, obtained from Aldrich) were added. The<br>
temperature of the mixture increased slightly due to the<br>
exothermic reaction. The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 hours, and then 60 grams (0.5 mole) of VNB<br>
were added drop-wise with a rate such that the temperature of<br>
the reaction did not exceed 70'C. After the addition was<br>
completed (over a time period of 2 hours), 0.180 grams (0.5%)<br>
radical initiator Vazo 64 (2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile,<br>
obtained from DuPont) was added and the mixture was heated at<br>
70°C for 15 hours. The SH group analysis was conducted and<br>
