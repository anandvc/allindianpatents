TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARING RIMONABANT"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD., a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner<br>
In which  it  is  to he  performed:-<br><br>
ZRC-PD-022<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-l-yl)       pyrazole-3-carboxamide,       namely Rimonabant of formula 1 and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. BACKGROUND ART<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-l-yl) pyrazole-3-carboxamide, namely Rimonabant of formula 1.<br><br>
1<br>
Obese patients are at higher risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, among other diseases and thus their risk of morbidity and mortality increases. Due to many complex pathophysiological components which lead to obesity, the disease remains a challenging and significant clinical problem. Cannabinoides acting via cannabinoid receptors stimulate food intake and a particularly attractive antiobesity target is the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, which has also been shown to play a role in reinforcing reward. (LA. Sorbera et al., Drugs of Future 2005; 30(2): 128-137). Rimonabant in the form of its hydrochloride salt is a promising CB1 receptor antagonist that has shown to inhibit motivational and consummatory aspects of feeding, as well as alcohol and nicotine intake in animal models. Rimonabant has recently received its first approval in UK for the treatment of obesity. The agent also exhibited efficacy in phase III clinical trials and hold promise in the treatment of smoking cessation.<br>
Rimonabant hydrochloride has been disclosed in EP 0576357, EP 0656354, EP 0658546, US 5624941 and US 5462960. The processes disclosed for the preparation of Rimonabant hydrochloride in these applications comprises Claisen condensation of 4-chloropropiophenone 2 with diethyl oxalate in the presence of lithium hexamethyl disilazide to give 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3 methyl-2,4-dioxybutyric acid ethyl ester lithium salt 3. Condensation of compound 3 with 2,4-dichlorophenyl hydrazine 4 in refluxing ethanol<br>
2<br><br>
ZRC-PD-022<br>
affords corresponding hydrazone 5, which is further cyclised to pyrazole 6 in refluxing AcOH. Hydrolysis of the ethyl ester 6 with KOH in refluxing H2O/MeOH yields carboxylic acid 7, which is then activated as acid chloride 8 by treatment with thionyl chloride. The acid chloride 8 is reacted with 1-aminopiperidine 9 in the presence of triethyl amine in CH2CI2 to obtain the final compound, Rimonabant I. Rimonabant may be further treated with HC1 in ethyl ether to form its hydrochloride salt.<br>
Following is the synthetic scheme depicting the above mentioned process (scheme 1):<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
However,  this process involves certain technical difficulties.  Use of somewhat expensive lithium hexamethyl disilazide in the reaction process poses risk in handling,<br>
3<br><br>
ZRC-PD-022<br>
thereby leading to safety as well as reproducibility problems for producing intermediate compound 5. While refluxing compound 5 in acetic acid to obtain 6, the reaction tends to remain incomplete even after 24 hours of refluxing, thereby leading to cumbersome and a less viable process for commercial use. Also, in this process, the overall time to prepare cyclic ester compound 6 from 4-chloropropiophenone 2 takes almost 20 to 24 hours.<br>
Thus, there is still a need for an improved process which is commercially viable and cost effective as well as environmental friendly giving reproducible and better yields.<br>
Therefore, we directed our research work to develop a process for the preparation of the said compound of formula 1. with the objective of developing an efficient, economical and commercially more viable process employing cheaper and easily available raw materials, involving simple reaction steps and mild reaction conditions.<br>
The present invention discloses an improved process for preparING of Rimonabant 1. EMBODIMENT(S) OF THE INVENTION:<br>

In another embodiment of the invention describes a process, which overcomes some of the above stated disadvantages in the prior art.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is directed towards pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of Rimonabant hydrochloride prepared according to the process of present invention.<br>

Rimonabant 1 as prepared according to the present invention can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical ly acceptable formulations for e.g. tablets, capsules, granules and the like by combination with suitable excipients by processes, methods and amounts as are known. The improved process of the present invention has the following advantages:<br>
•	The present invention uses sodium ethoxide in place of lithium hexamethyldisilazide in the conversion of 2 to 10 that is more safe in handling during the step.<br>
•	It also reduces the number of steps, viz. conversion of 2 to 3 and then 5 to 6 as has been reported in the earlier processes, whereas in our process, we have directly converted 4-chloropropiophenone 2 to cyclic ester compound 6 without any need to isolate and characterize the intermediate.<br>
•	The improved process is scalable at plant level and so industrially applicable on account of use of safer solvents in the reaction process.<br>
•	High yield of the final product (91 % yield).<br>
•	Substantial reduction in time for converting 2 to 6 from about 20-24 hours as reported in prior art, to 8 hours as is described in the present invention, leads to reduction in the time required for the overall process.<br>
•	The improved process disclosed in the present invention has been found to be very cost effective on account of using less expensive chemicals (sodium ethoxide instead of lithium hexamethyl disiilazide) during the process and substantially reducing the overall time for the reaction process.<br>
