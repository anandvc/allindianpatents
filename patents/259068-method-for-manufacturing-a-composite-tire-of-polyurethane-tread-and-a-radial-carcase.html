				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a composite rubber tire, and more particularly to a composite rubber that has a polyurethane tread to achieve an environmentally friendly tire with excellent mechanical efficiency.<br>
Polyurethane is a kind of material with excellent synthesis properties. After the development of over sixty years, it has owned special synthesis properties which are wide range of hardness, strength and modulus, high elongation wide usage range of temperature, good property of oil-resistance, low temperature and ozone aging. And also it owns excellent abrasion resistance. Its wearing-resistant property is better than that of natural rubber by 2-10 times and it can be called wear-resisting rubber. Besides, its molding technology and equipment are simple and can be recycled completely. It is an ideal rubber material of tire tread.<br>
Since 1960s, many countries in the world have begun the research of polyurethane applied to the tire manufacturing such as the Lim Corporation of Austria, Phoenix of Germany and UTI of Britain and so on. They mainly research the polyurethane entire casting tire, namely that both the tire body and tread are made of polyurethane material. At the beginning of molding, put the cord, belted and ring traveler etc. into the die and fix each position, and then adopting the method of centrifugal pouring, cast the polyurethane into the die. After the solidification demolding, the tire articles come out. The molding of entire casting polyurethane tire is very convenient and fast. And its cost is very low and is one-fifth of rubber tire manufacturing equipment investment. However, because its strong polarity and acute acting of intermolecular linkage and inner molecular hydrogen bond, Its the rigid of molecular chain is big, in the dynamic condition, the internal heat generation is also big. And the resist heat of polyurethane is poor and its long period of time<br>
usage temperature is below 80°C. So all these tires are only applied to low-speed vehicles the drive speed is below 50km/hour such as bicycle fun vehicle cutting-grass vehicle golf vehicle and sliding vehicle etc. Recently Amerityre corporation in the USA has researched developed a kind of spare tire for bus, Although its properties meat the NO. 109 safe standard of America federal motor vehicles, the tires are solid tires which are made from plugging polyurethane foam, the drive speed is still 50km/hour and its drive mileage is only 2000 miles. To sun up, because of the particularity of polyurethane material, at present, the polyurethane tires in the marker are the low-speed tires. SUMMARY<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to overcome the shortcomings of the above-mentioned polyurethane tires, we adopt the polyurethane tread/rubber tire body composite structure, and optimize and modify the polyurethane composition so as to make it have low development of heat and high heat resistance, so we provide a method for manufacturing polyurethane-rubber composite tire which has long lifetime, simple technology, low cost and easy industrialization.<br>

Example 4<br>
Step 1: Surface treatment of an internal rubber tire body:<br>
A combinative method of painting surface treating agent and coating Polyurethane adhesive was used as a method for surface treatment of an internal rubber body. (1 preparation of a surface treatment agent<br>
A solution was obtained by adding N,N-di-chloro-p-toluene-sulfonamide(12PHR) into anhydrous acetone-solvent(88PHR)and dispersing uniformly with trimming, then benzoyl peroxide(7.2PHR)was dissolved in this solution (2) Preparation of polyurethane adhesive<br>
A reactive pot was charged with polyoxytetramethylene glycol of a molecular weight of 2000(1OOPHR)and heated to 120+ 10°C, The reactant was dehydrated for<br>
2 hours at a less than SOOPa vacuum atmosphere, then cooled to 70±5°C and added in MDI(55PHR)under protection of Nitrogen atmosphere for 1-2hours, the isocyanate content(NCO%)was tested and the reaction could be stopped if the isocyanate content of the mixture was 7.9 percent, before application, the mixture(55PHR)should be diluted uniformly by ethyl acetate (45PHR), then 1,4-butanedibl/triethanolamine mixing chain extender(3.94PHR) was added into the mixture to obtain a final adhesive, among which, the PHR of the 1.4-butanediol is 3.51, the PHR of the triethanolamine is 0.43. (3) Suarface treatment process of rubber tire body:<br>
A rubber radial tire was polished on the surface where the polyurethane tread should be applied, after trimmed clearly, the rubber tire was sprayed or coated uniformly with surface treatment agent{made in step 11} and stayed for 45 minutes, the surface was sprayed or coated with the polyurethane adhesives {made in step I 2} and placed for 2 hours, the tire body can be used to cast the polyurethane tread. Step2 preparation of polyurethane pre-polymer for tire tread<br>
In this example, choose the ploycaprolactone diol molecular weight is 2000/polybutadiene glycol-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, among which, the molecular weight of polybutadiene glycol is 2000, And silicon whisker was used to be modifier. (1) preparation of modified silicon whisker<br>
Silicon whisker powder (1OOPHR) was heated to 230 to 250°C and activated for 4 hours. MDI (OPHR) was dissolved into anhydrous toluene solvent(250PHR) and added into activated silicon whisker powder to obtain a mixture. The mixture was<br>
heated to 80±2°C for 2 hours, then the mixture was heated to 230+ 10°C and dried<br>
for 6 hours at a less than 500Pa vacuum atmosphere to achieve a solid, the modified silicon whisker was produced by and pulverizing the solid.<br>
(2)	Preparation of polyurethane pre-polymer for the treacle<br>
A reactive pot was charged with an average molecular weight of 2000: ploycaprolactone glycol(75PHR), a molecular weight of 2000 polybutadiene glycol(25PHR)and modified silicon whisker, the mixture was heated to 120+10°C and dehydrated for 1 hour at a less than 500Pa vacuum atmosphere, then added diphenylmethane diisocyanate(37PHR) after cooled to 60-65°C and dissolved it with<br>
strong stirring, the mixture was heated to 80±2°C and reacted for 2 hours to obtain<br>
a silicon whisker modified polyurethane pre-polymer.<br>
(3)	Disperse the modified silicon whisker (5PHR){made in step 11} into pre-<br>
polymer(100PHR){made in step 12 },So we can obtain the modified silicon whisker<br>
polyurethane pre-polymer for tire tread.<br>
Step 3 manufacturing for the polyurethane composite tire (1) Materials:<br>
The pre-polymer {made in step I 3} was transferred into a tank of a casting machine and heated to 80±°C, then deaerated for 10-15 minutes under a less than<br>
500Pa vacuum atmosphere, resorcinol-di-( 3 -hydroxyethyl ether was transferred into B tank, the quality of chain extender and the ratio of pre-polymer VS resorcinol-di-(p-hydroxyethyl were calculated by a traditional method, the details was shown as follows:<br>
the quantity of chain extender per 100(PHR)polyurethane pre-polymer is:<br>
6=0.060*2.36*0.95*100 =13.45<br>
Above 0.060 equals the isocyanate content theoretical value of polyurethane pre-polymer;<br>
2.36 equals the constant of the chain extender when it is resorcinol-di-(β-hydroxyethl) ether;<br>
0.95equals value of chain extender.<br>
i.e. every 100 part polyurethane pre-polymer is corresponding to 13.45 part chain extender. The A and B component metering pumps of polyurethane elastomer casting machine were adjusted according to the proportion. (2) Casting<br>
The tire body which had been treated and coated with polyurethane adhesive was placed into a mold at a temperature of 110°C, then the casting machine was applied to cast a polyurethane tread. The pressure was kept at 200-300 kpa and the mold temperature was retained at 110°C. After 80 minutes, the internal rubber body casted with a polyurethane tread was detached from the mold and moved into an oven or a baking channel with an inner-temperature of 110°C. and stayed for 18 hours to achieve a final tire.<br><br><br><br>
