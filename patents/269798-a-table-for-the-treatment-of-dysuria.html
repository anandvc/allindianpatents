BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known that KMD-3213, which is contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical for the treatment of dysuria of the present invention, has selective suppressing activities on the contraction of urethra smooth muscles, and is an extremely useful compound as a medicament for treating dysuria without causing strong hypotensive activities or orthostatic hypotension.<br>
As for pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213, pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, the following literatures have been known so far.<br>
Inpatent literature 1, which discloses indoline compounds including KMD-3213, several dosage forms are exemplified as an oral solid formulation. It is also reported therein as a general description that such dosage forms may be prepared by formulating indoline compounds according to conventional formulation procedures. However, patent literature 1 has not disclosed a specific formulation comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213.<br>
In patent literature 2, which discloses a medicament<br>
comprising, as an active ingredient, an a1-AR blocking agent including KMD-3213 for treating lower urinary tract disorders, several dosage forms are exemplified as an oral solid formulation. It is also reported that such dosage forms may be prepared using ordinary pharmaceutical additives according to conventional formulation procedures. However, patent literature 2 has not disclosed a specific pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213.<br>
KMD-3213 is relatively unstable against a light exposure. Admixing some kind of pharmaceutical additives with KMD-3213 results in incompatibility and yields degradation products. For example, compatibility between KMD-3213 and lactose, which is most popularly used as a filler, is bad, and use of lactose as a filler gives undesirable dissolution properties and unsatisfactory hardness of tablets. Moreover, KMD-3213 has a potent adhesive property, and in the case of preparing a tabletor capsule, use of a lubricant is inevitable. On the contrary, the addition of such lubricants causes the problem of delaying in dissolution time. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult to prepare practically usable solid oral dosage form Pharmaceuticals comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213, its prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof by conventional formulation methods.<br>
Regarding such problems, patent literatures 1 and 2 do not disclose or suggest any method to solve the problems. Patent literature 2 discloses a process for preparing capsules comprising, as an active ingredient, tamuslosin hydrochloride or alfuzosin hydrochloride. However, the pharmaceutical compositions of such capsules are quite different from those of the present invention. Moreover, pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can not be prepared by processes disclosed in patent literature 2. Accordingly, patent literature 2 does not teach or suggest the present invention at all. Patent literature 1: Japanese unexaminedpublication H06-220015<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a practically usable solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical for treating dysuria without affecting blood pressure, which comprises, as an activeingredient, KMD-3213, itsprodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein said pharmaceutical has a high precision for content uniformity, good stabilities and excellent dissolution properties.<br>
In cases where Pharmaceuticals are administered orally, bioavailability of active ingredients contained therein is quite important, and exerting a constant efficacy is also required. For that purpose, assuring uniformity, i.e. bioeqivalence among formulation batches is required. In pharmacopoeias, procedures for testing disintegrating or dissolution properties of solid formulations are defined for assuring a constant quality and bioequivalence of the formulations. Accordingly, Pharmaceuticals are requested to meet specifications as defined based on such tests.<br>
Recently, dissolution testing is considered as an important means for estimating efficacy or safety profiles of Pharmaceuticals. Particularly in the case of hardly soluble drug substances, dissolution properties rather than disintegration properties are more crucial for estimating the quality of<br>
o<br>
Pharmaceuticals comprising such substances.<br>
In the light of bioequivalence, dissolution tests are desirable to carry out under a variety of testing conditions. However, it is difficult to define a specification of the dissolution tests based on various conditions, and ordinarily the dissolution tests are carried out under a condition in which Pharmaceuticals are most likely to be non-bioequivalent. As a test medium in a dissolution test, test media in the physiological<br>
\range of pH, i.e. pH 1 to 7, or water are generally used, while differences in formulations are detected clearly by using a test medium in which active ingredients are slowly released from the formulations. Water is sensitive to a change of pH. On the contrary, water is a test medium which can evaluate subtle differences in formulations or manufacturing processes. Accordingly, in cases where water can be used as a test medium in a dissolution test, it is desirable to use water in view of efficacies in tests, economical efficacies and effects on the environment.<br>
KMD-3213 has relatively a high solubility in an.acidic medium and is hardly soluble in a neutral medium such as water. Consequently, water is the most suitable test medium for evaluating non-bioequivalence on conducting a dissolution test. In developing a solid oral dosage form formulation comprising KMD-3213 as an active ingredient, it is desirable to find a formulation having a good dissolution property in water. In a pharmaceutical of the present invention, T85% is preferably not more than 60 minutes in a dissolution test according to method 2 (paddle method) of Japanese pharmacopoeia in a condition using water as a test medium and a paddle speed of 5O rpm, more preferably T85% is not more than 30 minutes, and most preferably T85% is not more than 15 minutes.<br>
Solid oral dosage form Pharmaceuticals are desired to show good dissolution properties in the stomach except for cases where the pharmaceutical are enteric coated formulations due to their unstable properties in acidic conditions. Since KMD-3213 is stable in acidic conditions, solid oral dosage form formulationscomprising KMD-3213 as an active ingredient are desired to show good dissolution properties in the first fluid, which is corresponding to gastric juice, in a dissolution test. Accordingly, in solid oral dosage form formulations of the present invention, T85% is preferably not more than 60 minutes in a dissolution test using the first fluid as in cases where the dissolution test is carried out using water, more preferably T85% is not more than 30 minutes, and most preferably T85% is not more than 15 minutes.<br>
Active ingredients contained in Pharmaceuticals exhibit generally their biological activities in a minute quantity of dosage. Therefore, for exerting a constant efficacy, it is important to make the content of active ingredients at a constant level and minimize a decrease in the content of the active ingredients during storage. For that purposes, it is desired to show a high content uniformity among formulation batches and high stabilities during storage.<br>
KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical of the present invention has potent adhesive and electrostatic properties. Particularly, in cases where formulations are prepared by a dry process, electrostatic charges are generated by physical irritations caused through processes such as pulverization, agitation, blending, granulation and the like, which in turn cause a decrease in fluidity of pulverized, blended or granulated materials, worsen handling properties, and decrease precision for content uniformity of an active ingredient.<br>
In the case of tablets or capsules, lubricants are added at the steps of filling or tabletting in consideration of handling properties, precision for filling and the like. KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical of the present invention has potent adhesive properties, and use of lubricants is inevitable. On the contrary, the use of the lubricants causes delaying in a dissolution time. Furthermore, KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical of the present invention is relatively unstable against a light exposure, and requires a careful handling. In such cases, formulations are generally stored under a light-resistant packaging. However, opaque light-resistant packages are difficult to detect contaminations of foreign materials. Moreover, when patients are actually taking formulations wrapped with light-resistant packages, the formulations are occasionally stored with pulled out of light-resistant packages. Accordingly, formulations, which can be stored without a light-resistant packaging and are highly photostable, are desired.<br>
The present inventors have eagerly investigated a solid dosage form pharmaceutical which comprises, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213, its prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof and are extremely useful for the treatment of dysuria, wherein said pharmaceutical has a high precision for content uniformity, excellent dissolution proper ties in water, orwaterand the first fluid and good stabilities.<br>
As a result, the present inventors have found that use of lactose, which is most popularly used as a filler, causes the problems of delaying in a dissolution time, decreasing in the hardness of tablets and the like. Consequently, preferable formulations cannot be prepared by using lactose as a filler. On further investigation into fillers, the present inventors have found that use of D-mannitol as a filler provides an extremely preferable dissolution property.<br>
Moreover, the present inventors have studied a variety of processes for preparing formulations, and have found out that formulations, which has satisfactory content uniformity without influenced by electrostatic charges and has good stabilities and excellent dissolution properties, are prepared through granulating by a wet process and regulating the amount of a lubricant and a mixing time. The present inventors have also found that in the cases of capsules, formulations with excellent dissolution profiles are prepared by admixing a lubricant in a specific ratio with another additive which is a solid with' hydrophilic ot surface-active properties. Furthermore, the present inventors have studied a photostable formulation to find out that the photo-degradations of KMD-3213 are well prevented by titanium oxide and photostable formulations can be prepared by using a capsule containing titanium oxide or a coating agent containing titanium oxide. Based on these findings, the present, invention has been accomplished.<br>
In many cases, compounds contained as an active ingredientare relatively unstable, and blending such compounds with pharmaceutical additives which are used for preparing solid dosage form formulations, often causes incompatibility such as discoloring, decomposing and the like. However, it is difficult to estimate compatibility between a pharmaceutical additive and an active ingredient beforehand.<br>
The  present  inventors  have  firstly  investigated compatibility between KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient of the present pharmaceutical and various kind of pharmaceutical additives used in the preparation of solid dosage form formulations, and then selected pharmaceutical additives which does not cause discoloring or decomposing. Thereafter, the present inventors have studied whether or not the selected pharmaceutical additives can be combined with each other without causing incompatibility and are suitable for manufacturability. As a result of studies on fillers, lactose most popularly used as a filler does not cause incompatibility but decreases in dissolution properties and the hardness of tablets. For that reasons, it is difficult to prepare a preferable formulation by using lactose as a filler. The delaying in a dissolution time caused by lactose is improved by adding crystalline cellulose while the hardness of tablets is not improved with the addition of crystalline cellulose. Moreover, crystalline cellulose causes incompatibility on blending with KMD-3213 and yields degradation products. Consequently, crystalline cellulose is not suitable for preparing a solid dosage form pharmaceutical of the present invention. On further investigation into fillers,the present inventors have found that D-mannitol is suitable for compatibility and manufacturability and provides an extremely good dissolution property, and accordingly is most suitable as a filler.<br>
As for a disintegrant, calcium carboxymethylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose are not suitable for causing a large degree of incompatibility while starch, low-substituted hydroxylpropylcellulose, partially pregelatinized starch or the like are preferred. Examples of starch include corn starch and the like. Examples of partiallypregeratini zed starch include starch 1500 (registered mark, Japan Colorcon Co., Ltd.), PCS (registered mark, Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) and the like.<br>
As for a binder, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose are not suitable for causing a small degree of incompatibility.<br>
As for a lubricant, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and talc do not cause incompatibility and are preferred.<br>
As for a surfactant, macrogol (polyethyleneglycol) , polyoxyethylene(105)polyoxypropylene(5)glycol and triethyl citrate are not suitable for causing a large degree of incompatibility.<br>
Based on these findings as described above, the preferred additives are selected. Then, processes for preparing formulations according to conventional procedures are investigated. Firstly, in cases where formulations are prepared by dry processes, pulverized, blended or granulated materials,which are prepared at pulverization, blending or granulation processes, generate electrostatic charges and decrease in fluidities of the materials. As a result, particularly in the case of preparing capsules, handling properties are worsened at the filling process, and uniformity of the fill volume and precision for filling are worsened.<br>
For improving handling properties or precision for filling,<br>
lubricants are generally used at the filling process in capsules<br>
or at the tabletting process in tablets. KMD-3213 has inherently<br>
potent adhesive properties, and particularly in the case of dry<br>
processes, electrostatic charges are generated and fluidities<br>
of blended or granulated materials are worsened as described<br>
above, which result in the use of much more amount of lubricants .<br>
However, lubricants have generally water repellent properties<br>
and the use of lubricants causes delaying in a dissolution time.<br>
The present inventors have intensively investigated the<br>
kind, combination or ratio of additives, manufacturing processes<br>
and the like,  and have found highly practically usable<br>
formulations which have suitable handling properties for<br>
manufacturing processes, high precision for content uniformity<br>
and excellent dissolution properties and are useful for exerting<br>
biological activities of KMD-3213 effectively.<br>
Firstly, the present inventors have found that delaying in a dissolution time is prevented to some extent by decreasing the amount of lubricants or shortening a mixing time. More specifically, good dissolution properties are accomplished by decreasing the amount of lubricants in not more than about 1%,IS"<br>
more preferably in the range of about 0.6% to about 0.8%, and mixing shortly for a period of about 3 to about 5 minutes. Then, formulations with good fluidities of blended materials, satisfactory handling properties and high precision for filling can be prepared by granulating through a wet process in place of a dry process, using lubricants in an amount of not more than 1% and mixing for a period of about 3 minutes.<br>
However, KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in<br>
a pharmaceutical of the present invention has potent adhesive<br>
properties, and in cases where capsules are prepared by using<br>
a lubricant in an amount of not more than about 1%, it is at<br>
high risk for causing a filling problem such as sticking.<br>
Regarding such problems, the present inventors have investigated<br>
a process for improving the delay in a dissolution time even<br>
in the case of using a lubricant in an amount of not less than<br>
1%, and have found out that the delaying in a dissolution time<br>
can be prominently improved by blending a solid additive having<br>
hydrophilic  or  surface-active  properties  and  thereby<br>
formulations with good dissolution properties can be prepared.<br>
The effect of improving the delay in a dissolution time<br>
by the above mentioned additive differs depending on a<br>
combination of the additive with a lubricant. For example, where<br>
magnesium stearate is used as a lubricant, sodium lauryl sulfate<br>
is most preferred for the improving effect, and sucrose ester<br>
of  fatty  acid,   light  anhydrous  silicic  acid  and<br>
polyoxyethylene(105)polyoxypropylene(5)glycol	are<br>
unsatisfactory for the effect. For exerting a satisfactoryimproving effect, it is preferred to use in an amount of about 0.1 to about 2 parts, more preferably about 0.5 parts of sodium lauryl sulfate based on 1 part of magnesium stearate where dissolution properties can be maintained at a desirable level.<br>
The effect of improving the delay in a dissolution time by sodium lauryl sulfate varies greatly depending on addition methods. For example, where sodium lauryl sulfate is dissolved in water and added together with bound water at a granulating process (hereinafter referred to as "addition during granulation", dissolution rates are decreased at a point immediately after starting a dissolution test (5 minutes value) . On further investigation, the present inventors have found out that the delaying at an initial rise can be prevented by adding sodium lauryl sulfate together with a lubricant after a granulating process (hereinafter referred to as "addition after granulation".<br>
KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage f ormpharmaceutical of the present invention is relatively unstable against a light exposure and the amount of the active ingredient is decreased with time depending on storage conditions . Accordingly, KMD-3213 requires a careful storage condition and handling. In such cases, formulations are generally stored under a light-resistant packaging, while opaque light-resistant packages are difficult to detect contaminations of foreign materials and are accordingly at high risk for overlooking defective product. Moreover, when patients are actually taking formulations wrapped with light-resistant packages, then<br>
formulations are occasionally stored with pulled out of light-resistant packages . Accordingly, formulations, which can be stored without a light-resistant packaging and are highly photostable, are desired.<br>
The present inventors have investigated a preferable light-shielding material for blending in capsules or coating agents, and have found out that titanium oxide is most preferred as a light-shielding material. Highly photostable capsules or tablets can be prepared by using capsules containing titanium oxide or coating agents containing titanium oxide.<br>
Photostabilities are evaluated as follows. Firstly, upper acceptance criteria for the amounts (%) of each photodegradation materials (hereinafter referred to as "related substance") and the total amounts (%) of all related substances are defined. Then, the photostabilities are evaluated by assessing whether or not the amounts of related substances are conformed to the acceptance criteria in the presence of standard light exposure. It is reported in JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) that standard illumination levels are 300-7501ux/hour in a hospital pharmacy where average lighting hours are about 8 hours/day and maximum shelf life of Pharmaceuticals are 6 months . Accordingly, standard light exposure is estimated to be about 1.2 million lux/hour, which is calculated by considering a condition of 750 lux/hour as a maximum illumination level, about 8 hours as a daily lighting hour and 180 days as a light exposure period that is corresponding to an about 1.08 million lux/hour of light exposure, and its measurement deviation. In a guideline of<br>
ethical Pharmaceuticals, photostability testing is required to carry out under an overall illumination of not less than about 1. 2 million lux/hour. Consequently, it is requested that ethical Pharmaceuticals are stable under a light exposure of about 1.2 million lux/hour in a photostability test.<br>
It is ascertained that there are at least 6 related substances in KMD-3213 contained as an active ingredient in a solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical of the present invention. A provisional specification is defined as not more than 4% for the largest quantity of related substance a, not more than 1% for each of related substances b to f and not more than 5% for total amounts of all related substances including minute quantities of other related substances. The present inventors have investigated a light-shielding capsule or coating agent for conforming to a light exposure of about 1.2 million lux/hour.<br>
As a result, titanium oxide is most preferred as a light-shielding material, and highly photostable solid dosage form Pharmaceuticals are prepared by using capsules containing titanium oxide or coating agents containing titanium oxide.<br>
Light-shielding effects increase with blending amounts of titanium oxide while the strength of capsules decreases with blending amounts of titanium oxide. Preferred blending amounts are appropriately determined depending on the size of Pharmaceuticals. For exerting preferable light-shielding effects in capsules, the blending amount of titanium oxide is not less than about 3%, more preferably about 3.4-3.6%. For tablets, the blending amount of titanium oxide is determinedby the surface area of tablets, the amount of coating agents and the like. For exerting preferable light-shielding effects, the coating amount of titanium oxide is generally not less than O.Smg/square cm, more preferably 1.Img/square cm based on the surface area of tablets.<br>
Regarding pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, there are only general descriptions in patent literatures 1 and 2 which do not teach or suggest any specific pharmaceutical composition.<br>
As described above, there are many problems to solve for providing a practically usable solid oral dosage form pharmaceutical comprising, as an active ingredient, KMD-3213, its prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof according to conventional formulation methods. Patent literatures 1 and 2 does not disclose or suggest the problems and any method to solve such problems.<br>

KMD-3213, pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt  or  pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof is admixed with a filler, preferably D-mannitol, if required, an appropriate binder and disintegrator. Then, the mixture is kneaded with the addition of an aqueous solution of binder in an appropriate concentration, and if required, sieved to prepare a granule. Thereafter, a lubricant, preferably magnesium stearate and a solid additive with hydrophilic or surface-active properties, preferably sodium lauryl sulf ate are added to the granule, in that case the lubricant being used in an amount of 0. 5-2 . 0%, and the solid additive being used in a ratio of 1:10 to 20:10, more preferably 5:10 to 10:10, even more prefer ably 5:10 relatively to magnesium stearate. Then, mixing and filling into an appropriate capsule, preferably a capsule containing titanium oxide in a blending amount of not less than about 3%, more preferably about 3.4 to 3.6% provide capsules.<br>
Tablets can be prepared as follows. A granule is prepared<br>
ccording to procedures analogous to those as described in capsules.
