SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE Method for isolating cells from mammary secretion<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for isolating cells from a human body, as well as uses of such cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Stem cells are defined as clonogenic, self-renewing progenitor cells that can generate a wide variety of more specialised cell types via the process of differentiation. Classically, it has been believed that there are two distinct types of stem cell. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner mass of the blastocyst, are pluripotent and thus are capable of generating into all differentiated cell types within the body. The other sub-population of stem cells are derived from ES cells and arc organ-or tissue-specific. These multipotcnt cells, also known as adult stem cells, were believed to be able to differentiate only into tissues from their organ of origin. An example of these multipotcnt cells are haematopoietic stem cells, which serve to continually regenerate the cells of the blood and immune system.<br>
Stem cells have been isolated from a wide range of tissues, from those that have a high rate of ongoing cellular turnover, such as blood, cord blood, bone marrow, skin, intestine, and breast tissue, to those with a low turnover such as brain, skeletal muscle.<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH20O4/000738<br>

and juvenile teeth. Irrespective of the tissue of origin, a long standing dogma has been that adult stem cells can only differentiate into the tissues from which they were derived. However recent work has demonstrated that upon exposure to a novel environment, organ-specific stem cells can overcome these intrinsic restrictions to transdifferentiatc into other tissues. For example it has been shown that neural stem cells can transdiffercntiate into blood cells, bone-manow derived stem cells can transdifferentiate into muscle, brain, liver and heart cells, and skin derived stem cells can transdifferentiate into brain cells. Therefore it now appears likely that the dogma associated with developmental restriction of organ-specific stem cells is incorrect and it is feasible that these ES cells under appropriate environmental stimuli, can transdifferentiatc into another cell type.<br>
Human milk contains a mixture of different cell types. Secretory epithelial cells (lactocytes) are found in milk due to them sloughing off the basement membrane of the breast as a consequence of the pressure associated with the continued filling and emptying of the breast. Lactocytes account for approximately 10-20% of the total cell population. The majority of the remainder of cells found in human milk are leukocytes (immune cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, basophils, cosinophils, and neutrophils), and are believed to be in milk to both protect the breast from infection and to provide immune protection for the infant. To date, these arc the only cell types believed to be contained in milk.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective problem underlying the present invention is therefore to provide a new method for isolating progenitor cells from the human body. In this context, the term progenitor cells shall include all cells with stem cell-like characteristics, preferentially but not exclusively including pluripotent or multipotent progenitor cells like for example stem cells.<br>
The present invention solves the above problem by deriving such cells directly or indirectly from human mammary secretion, be it colostrum, mature milk, or dry period<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH 2004/000738<br>
3<br>
secretion from males or females, of said human body during at least one of the following periods: non-pregnant period, pregnant period, lactating period, involuting period. In other words, here we demonstrate that surprisingly, progenitor cells can also be found in human lactation milk and that these cells have the potential to be utilised for the generation of tissues for the mother and infant. It has to be noted that not only human mammary secretion but generally mammary secretion from mammalian species can be used for the isolation of corresponding progenitor cells. It can unambiguously be shown by means of progenitor-cell-specific antibodies, that indeed mammalian secretion, i.e. for example human milk, comprises progenitor cells.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, said progenitor cells are isolated from the mammary secretion in that non-cellular parts of the mammary secretion are separated from the cellular parts and that in particular non-pluripotcnt or non-multipotent cells are removed from cellular parts thus derived. The cellular parts of mammary secretion, apart from pluripotent cells may further comprise secretory epithelial cells, leucocytes and in particular nonhuman cells like bacterial cells. Those non-pluripotent cells are preferentially removed from the mammary secretion.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mammary secretion during lactating periods is used for the isolation of the progenitor cells, wherein the mammary secretion during particular stages of mammary secretion such as: after beginning of individual feeding; versus end of individual feeding; lactation phase; preferably early lactation, is used.<br>
A particularly useful and practicable way of isolating those progenitor cells from the secretion is possible if magnet beads are used. Those magnetic beads are to this end preferentially connected to progenitor-cell-specific antibodies allowing the attachment of the beads to the progenitor cells.<br>
Typically, in a first step cellular components are washed out of the mammary secretion, in a second step said cellular components are stained with antibodies to the progenitor cell markers, and in a third step the progenitor cells are separated from the other cells directly or indirectly by means of the attached antibodies, preferentially, but not<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH2004/000738<br>
4<br>
exclusively, by using the above-mentioned magnetic beads. To this end, the antibody-stained progenitor cells are attached to beads, preferably small iron beads, and the progenitor cells are extracted by means of the beads, preferably in case of small iron beads by using a magnet, and wherein subsequently the beads as well as if need be the antibodies are removed from the progenitor cells. This is for example possible by selecting the beads, which have been provided with specific antibodies attached to the beads, which antibodies selectively bind to the progenitor cells. To obtain the pure cells, subsequently the beads are removed from the progenitor cells, which is for example possible by means of enzymes cleaving the link between the beads and the antibodies. If the link berween the beads and the antibodies is based on DNA, such cleavage can be effected by using Dnase, in case where the link between the beads and the antibodies is based on amino acid chains, protcinases can be used.<br>
Surprisingly, while normally progenitor cells have to be cultured , i.e. grown, on very specific feeder layers, like for example mouse fibroblast feeder layers, the progenitor cells isolated in the present method do not need such specific feeder layers, but can generally be grown on other feeder layers based on for example the ones disclosed within the scope of the specific examples.<br>
More specifically, the method of isolation comprises the following steps: (i) the whole human mammary secretion is subjected to centrifugation generally leaving a fat layer on top, a protein and carbohydrate rich supernatant beneath it, and at the bottom a pellet of cells; (ii) fat fraction and supernatant are removed; (iii) e.g. a buffer, such as, but not limited to, phosphate buffered saline, tris buffer saline, TBS and/or PBS, or media, such as, but not limited to, Williams media or RPMI Media, is added and the cells (not only comprising progenitor cells) arc resuspended in the buffer / media and centrifuged as before, preferentially repeating this process 3 or 4 times, leaving a substantially pure cell pellet; (iv) the progenitor cells are separated from the cell pellet.<br>
Preferentially, the separation of the progenitor cells from the cell pellet is carried out in the following steps:(v) the cell pellet is suspended in media, preferentially in RPMI media containing for example fetal calf (bovine) scrum; (vi) this suspension is incubated<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH20O4/0OO738<br>
5<br>
with (magnetic) beads which have preferentially before been incubated with progenitor-specific antibodies (preferentially stem cell-specific antibodies, like anti-mouse IgG antibodies), which antibodies are attached to the magnetic beads via a small strand for example of DNA or ami no acids, wherein the incubation of the cell suspension in these magnetic beads is preferentially carried our for 15 minutes at 4°C; (vii) once the progenitor cells have bound to the magnetic beads a magnet is attached to the tube containing the cells/beads, thus attracting the progenitor cells connected with the beads to the magnet, whereas unbound cells are not and remain in the supernatant; (viii) removing the supernatant leaving only the progenitor cells bound to the beads via the progenitor cell antibody.<br>
It has to be pointed out that other types of beads or generally separation means can be used which allow to selectively attach them to the progenitor cells. Such beads have to be separated from the progenitor cells, and to this end preferentially the following processing steps can be used: (ix) progenitor cells bound to the beads via the stem cell antibody are removed by an appropriate cleavage means, preferentially, in case of the antibody being attached to the beads via small strand of DNA, a by means of addition of a Dnase, (x) the beads are removed by attaching the magnet once more, such that the beads, no longer attached to the stem cells, are attracted to it; (xi) removing the supernatant now containing the isolated progenitor cells.<br>
An alternative method of separation which is based on sp*cific growth of pluripotent cells involves the following steps:<br>
(i) a first step the whole human mammary secretion is subjected to centrifugation leaving a fat layer on top, a protein and carbohydrate rich supernatant beneath it, and at the bottom a pellet of cells.<br>
(ii) in an optional second step, the cell pellet is washed in media. Preferably the cells are washed in RPMI media only.<br>
/in) in a third step the cells of the cell pellet are plated onto a cell culture treated device in growth media and arc allowed to incubate. Preferably this incubation is carried out for 10-30 days, most preferably for 14-20 days.<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH2OO4/OOO7J8<br>
6<br>
(iv) the cells axe harvested, i.e. they are detached from the support, preferably by trypsination. Subsequently the detached cells are washed, preferably using growth media solution.<br>
(v) the harvested and washed cells are plated onto a reconstituted basement membrane preparation for growth, preferably up to confluence. In this last step, preferably a solubulizcd basement membrane preparation extracted from EHS mouse sarcoma is used, like e.g. Matrigel™ as available from BD Bioscienccs.<br>
This method leads to cell cultures with a morphology which is typical for progenitor cells. The cells do not look like lactocytes and due to the growth media which is permissive for progenitor/stem cell/lactocyte growth, they cannot be bacterial cells.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to progenitor cells, which are preferentially pluripotent or multipotent progenitor (stem) cells, derived using a method as described above.<br>
Additionally, the present invention relates to uses of such progenitor cells, for example for ex vivo, in vitro and/or in vivo applications. Without limiting the scope of the invention, such use may extend to the following specific examples or combinations thereof : creation of tissues or cells for the benefit of the mother and/or of the infant and/or of other individuals; subsequent gene therapy treatments or intrauterinc foetal treatments; generation of cells, tissue, glands or organs for the treatment of disease; subsequent cloning or scientific research; one or several of the group of the following purposes: clinical, diagnostic, bioengineering, lactoengineering, breast tissue regeneration, breast reconstructive surgery, breast cosmetic or enhancement surgery, exocrine gland tissue regeneration and/or surgery.<br>
Further embodiments of the present invention are outlined in the dependent claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
To determine whether a cell believed to be a stem cell is actually a stem cell, it has historically been necessary to undertake transplantation of the cells of interest into sub-lethally irradiated mice. If these transplanted cells subsequently locate and repopulate any organs of these mice, the cells in question have been considered to be pluripotent stem cells. However, more recently the identification of extracellular markers for pluripotcnt stem cells (for example Tra-1-60 and SSEA-4; Chcmicon International, Temccula, California, US) have enabled the identification of pluripotent (stem) cells without the prolonged process of transplantation.<br>
After washing all cells out of human milk by a repeating the process of gentle centrifugation, aspiration of the supernatant and the rcsupension of the cells in a buffer or media several times, the stem cells were isolated from a total milk cell population (Figure 1) using dynabeads according to manufacturers specifications. As buffer Tris-buffcTed saline solutions (TBS) or phosphate buffered saline solutions (PBS) can be used. In particular, TBS-soIutions which are 10 mM in Tris, 150 mM in NaOH and which arc adjusted to have a pH around 7.4 can be used. In case of PBS-solutions, those maybe 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 140mM NaCl, 4.5mM NajHPO4.7H2O and 2.7mM NaCI, and may be adjusted to have a pH around 7.4. As media, Williams or RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) as available from Sigma Aldrich, US, under the product numbers<br><br>
WO 2005/06)696	PCT/CH 2004/0007J8<br>
9<br>
R6504, R7755, R4130 or W4125, W4128, W1878, can be used. Also possible as media is RPMI from Gibco (CA, US) Cat. No 11875-093.<br>
Stem cell-specific antibodies, e.g. Tra-1-60, Tra 1-81 and/or SSEA-4, both monoclonal, both e.g. available from Chemicon international, CHEMICON International, 28820 Single Oak Drive, Temecula CA 92590, were attached to the Dynabcads* for isolation of the progenitor cells. Also possible is the use of haematopoietic cells antibody CD 133 (cat* MAB1133) from R&amp;D Systems, Inc CA, US.<br>
Primitive haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from peripheral blood have already been isolated using the immuno-magnctic cell separation principles. Research groups using monoclonal-antibody conjugated magnetic particles (CliniMACS System and Reagent AC133 from Miltcnyi Biotcc) have successfully isolated and cultured CD133 positive cells.<br>
Any stem cell-specific antibody (inclusive of; SSEA-3, SSEA-1 and TRA 1-81 Oct-4, CD 133) are incubated with Dynabeads". Dynabeads* are available from Dynal AS, NO, and are small iron beads, that have an anti-mouse igG antibody attached to it via a small strand of DNA. Possible are for example Dynabcads* available under the name Dynal CD34. Incubation of the Dynabcads* is carried out for lh at room temperature prior to the Dynabeads  being incubated with the cells isolated from milk for 15 minutes at 4°C.<br>
Once the stem cells have bound to the Dynabcads which typically takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour, a magnet is attached to the side of the tube containing the cells/Dynabeads*. Dynabeads* are uniform, polystyrene-based, paramagnetic, beads with 4.5 urn in diameter. The Dynabeads' (with the stem cells attached) are attracted to the magnet, whereas the unbound cells arc not and remain in the supernatant. The supernatant is then removed leaving only the cells bound to the Dynabcads via the stem cell antibody. The cells bound to the Dynabcads* via the stem cell antibody arc removed by the addition of Dnase breaking the small strand of DNA. This is called releasing buffer and is part of the DynaJ kit 62500 U/ml (15000-20000U per vial quoted in the instructions). The Dynabeads* are removed by attaching the magnet once more to which the Dynabeads*, no longer attached to the stem cells, arc attracted.    The<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH 2004/000738<br>
10<br>
supernatant now contains the stem cells which arc removed. These stem cells can now be used for any subsequent application as listed above/below.<br>
The isolated progenitor (stem) cells can be cultured on mouse embryo fibroblast feeder cells in Knockout-Dulbccco's modified Eagle's medium. Typically cultivation can be carried out at a temperature of 37°C.<br>
Examples of the use of feeder cells:<br>
•	Prolonged propagation of human embryonic stem cells is cunently achieved by<br>
coculture with primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts serving as feeder cells.<br>
•	Acceleration of the formation of cultured epithelium using the sonic hedgehog<br>
expressing feeder cells.<br>
•	Human adult marrow cells support prolonged expansion of human embryonic<br>
stem cells in culture.<br>
•	Proliferation and maturation of embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells in an<br>
in vitro model of vasculogenesis required OP9 feeder cells.<br>
•	Selective expansion and continuous culture of macrophages from adult pig<br>
blood. Macrophages were selectively expanded and continuously cultured from<br>
adult pig blood directly into the medium overlaying a feeder layer of STO mouse<br>
fibroblasts.<br>
•	Establishment    and     characterization    of    a    novel     human     immature<br>
megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, M-MOK, dependent on fibroblasts for its<br>
viability.   A  novel   fibroblast-dependent  human  immature megakaryoblastic<br>
leukemia cell line (M-MOK) was established from the bone marrow of a girl<br>
with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and its growth was determined to be<br>
completely dependent on  the  presence  of human  embryonic  lung-derived<br>
fibroblasts, HEL-O.<br>
•	In vitro culture of embryonic disc cells from porcine blastocysts using foetal G30<br>
porcine fibroblasts which had been previously irradiated as a feeder layer.<br><br>

• Acute lyinphocytic leukemias (ALL) cells of infants and children were found to preferentially survive in coculture with a cloned cell line of cndothelial adipose cells (14F1.1) from mouse bone marrow and exhibited extensive growth in the presence of the mouse stromal cells. These ALL cells were strictly dependent upon the mouse stromal clone 14F1.I and failed to proliferate in the absence of the endothelial adipocytcs or with a variety of feeder cells.<br>

Using these same purified stem cells we have been able to culture the cells (Figure 3) and demonstrate that these cells do undergo cell division (Figure 4). Following prolonged culture, we have been able to stain these cells using haematoxylin and cosin (Figure 5), and have demonstrated that these cells remain stem cells as they continue to bind the stem cell antibodies (Tra-1-60 and SSEA-4) following several months of culture, as visualised by confocal microscopy (Figure 6). Growth of the isolated cells was also verified, see Figure 7.<br>
An alternative way of isolation/growth of the pluripotent cells is using a specific combination of growth media by means of which it is possible to grow a monolayer of pluripotent cells that clearly do not look like lactocytes (see Fig. 8). Indeed the grown cells in culture are physically identical to for example liver stem cell cultures. Further<br><br>

classification of these cells by the cellular markers they express and by their gene activity is possible.<br>
This alternative way of isolation or selective growth can be carried out as follows: Preparation of Matrigel™ coated plates:<br>
The Matrigel (commercially available reconstituted basement membrane, BD Matrigel™, BD Bioscicnccs rcf-354234) was allowed to defrost slowly on ice. Pipette tips and culture plates were cooled and kept on ice prior to use. 50ul of the thawed Matrigel was aliqouted and spread with a pipette tip into each of the wells of a 24 well flat bottom microplatc and allowed to incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Following this the plates were further incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees centigrade in order to set the gel. Once set lml of growth media was aliquoted to each well and the plate returned to the incubator until required (no longer than 5 days).<br>
Growth and preparation of cells<br>
Freshly expressed hind milk (approximately 50ml, hind milk is human breastmilk that is high in fat content and creamy in color, it provides the bulk of the baby's calories and is most responsible for weight gain) was centriftjged to pellet the cells (details as given above).<br>
The cell pellet was washed 2x in RPM1 media (RPMI Medium 1640, Gibco ref-108-36) only.<br>
Cells were then plated onto cell culture treated plastic culture dishes in growth media (Cell culture growth media composition: RPMI 1640; Fetal Bovine scrum 20*/»; Insulin 5ug/ml; Cholera toxin 50ng/ml; Hydrocortisonc 0.5ug/ml; Penicilin streptomycin fungjzone 2x) and allowed to incubate for approximately 14-20 days.<br>
After this period plates showing large colonies and approaching confluence were selected and the cells harvested by trypsinization (Trypsin-EDTA lx, JRH Bioscicnce<br><br>
WO 2005/061696	PCT/CH2O04/00O738<br>
15<br>
ref=59218).<br>
The harvested cells were washed Ix in growth media and plated onto Matngel™ coated plates at a density approximately 1500 cells/ml.<br>
After around 14 days patches of confluent cells can be observed.<br>
Description<br>
The morphology is typically epithelial in that confluent sheets of cells develop and the cells within the colonies are closely associated. The fact that breastmilk derived cells cultured in this manner will proliferate in primary culture and form extensive circular colonies with well defined borders is strongly indicative of cells with progenitor like qualities. That the cells appear undiffercntiated and many can be observed to have a large nucleus to cytoplasm ratio is even more evidence for a progenitor like identity.<br>
