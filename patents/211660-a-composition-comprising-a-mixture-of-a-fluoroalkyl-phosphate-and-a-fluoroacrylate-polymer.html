THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A   COMPOSITION   COMPRISING   A   MIXTURE   OF  A   FLUOROALKYL PHOSPHATE AND A FLUOROACRYLATE POLYMER"<br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a mixture of a fluoroalkyl phosphate and a fluoroacrylate polymer<br>
Stone, masonry and various other substrates with surface porosity are used decoratively in the indoor and exterior environmenL However, such surfaces are easily stained, for instance by oils, hydraulic fluids, and oily and aqueous foodstuffs, including oils, coffee, ketchup, salad dressings, mustard, red wine, other beverages, and fruit preserves. Many of the prior art treatments, such as clear sealants based on poiyurethanes or epoxies, disadvantageously alter the appearance of the substrate. Such sealants can also trap moisture \vithin the treated substrate, promoting spalling.<br>
US Patent 4,957,948, of Terry and Mcintosh describes biocidal protective coatings for heat exchangers which consist of an organic water-resistant polymer with an associated mixture of mono-alkyl and bis-alkyl phosphates. The heat exchanger coatings of Terry and Mcintosh contain perfluoroalkyl methacrylate copolymers and up to 10% and preferably 1 - 5% by weight of an alkyl phosphoric acid or its derivative. The coatings are applied to heat exchanger coils, such as coils of aluminum or copper, to provide durable biocidal adherent coatings. In a related patent, US 4,935,232, Mcintosh describes microbiocidal phosphate additives which contain at least one free hydroxyl group. Mcintosh notes in US 4,935,232 that if all the hydroxyl groups of the microbiocidal phosphate are replaced by alkyl or other organic-groups, the phosphate will no longer exhibit microbiocidal activity. There is no teaching of use of their compositions for stain resistance on hard porous surfaces.<br><br>
It is desirable to improve the degree of stain resistance conferred on such substrates and also not promote spalling. The present invention provides such treatment for surfaces subject to staining.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

2
The present invention comprises new fluorinated aqueous compositions that, when applied to substrate surfaces, provide improved stain resistance, and the process for treating such substrates with the compositions of this invention. 2£     The present invention also comprises substrate surfaces treated with the stain resist compositions<br>
The term "substrate surfaces", as used herein, includes porous mineral surfaces. Specific examples of such substrates include unglazed concrete, brick, 30 \   tile, stone, grout, mortar, composite materials such as terrazzo, gypsum board, statuary, monuments, wood, and leather. These are used in the construction of buildings, roads, parking ramps, driveways, floorings, fireplaces, fireplace<br><br>
/I<br><br>
hearths, counter tops, and other decorative uses in interior and exterior applications.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the mechanism for the generation of the advantageous properties of the composition of this invention is the simultaneous provision of a chemically bound surface oil- and water-repellent layer from the fluorophosphatejsomponent of the composition, and"a deeper or penetrating oil and water repellent layer from the fluoroacrylate polymer component of the composition.<br><br>
10<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a mixture of at least 11% by weight of a fluoroalkyl phosphate and not more than 89% by weight of a fluoroacrylate polymer. The fluorophosphate is a mixture of mono(perflxioroaIkyI) phosphate and bis(perfluoroaIkyl) phosphate of the<br>
1$     structure of Formula 1A or a phosphate of the structure of Formula IB. Formula 1A typically contains ranges of 20 mole % bis(perfluoroalkyl) phosphate and 80 mole % mono(perfluoroaIkyI) phosphate to up to 85 mole % bis(perfluoroalkyl) phosphate and 15 mole % of mono(perfluoroalkyl) phosphate. Alternatively, Formula 1A is a mixture ofperfluorinated phos^phonic and phosphinic acids or<br>

25	The fluoroalkylphosphates are prepared according to the method described<br>
by Brace and Mackenzie, in US Patent 3,083,224. Typically, either phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) or phosphorus oxychloride (POCI3) are reacted with the fluoroalcohols to give mixtures of the mono- and bis(perfluoroalkyl)phosphoric acids. Neutralization, using common bases such as ammonium or sodium hydroxides provides the corresponding phosphates. Reacting an excess of fluoroalcohol with P2O5 followed by neutralization provides an equimolar mixture of mono(perfluoroaikyl)phosphate and bis(perfluoroalkyl)phosphate. Higher<br>
7<br><br>
ratios of bis(perfluoroalkyl)phbsphale to mono(perfluoroalkyl)phosphate are obtained-by using the methodx&gt;f Hayashi and Kawakami in US Patent 4,145,382.<br>
The salts of the fiuoroalkylphospnates are preferred over the corresponding acids as outlined in US Patent 3,083,224 by reason of their increased Water solubility. Examples of preparations of the fhiorophosphates are given in US Patent 3,094,547.<br>

The molecular weight of the polymer is between 1,000 and 20,000. The polymers were prepared by standard polymerization techniques. Monomers are typically dissolved in an organic solvent or in a mixture of organic solvents containing little or no water. Polymerization is initiated using 0.5 to 2% by weight<br>
20       of a standard free-radical initiator such as t-butylperoctoate, t-amyl peroxy 2-<br>
ethylhexanoate or 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile. Optionally 0.1 to 1% by weight of a standard chain transfer agent such as dodecyimercaptan may also be used. The use of a chain transfer agent in a solvent, such as tetrahydroruran or cumene, which itself provides chain transfer properties, can also be used<br>
2|5<br>
The molecular weight of the fluoroacrylate polymer ranges from about 1,000 to about 10,000, with a preferred range of Mn between about 1,500 and about 5,000, and a preferred Mw between about 2,000 and about 7,000. Polydispersities are usually between the range of 1.1 and 2.0. After the<br>
3J3     polymerization is complete, the acidic polymer solution is neutralized using a<br>
basic water solution to form an emulsion. Typically ammonium hydroxide is used. The amount of base necessary is calculated by assuming complete salt formation of all acid functionalities. Optionally 0 - 5% mole percent excess of base is added<br>
11<br><br>
WO 01/36526<br><br>
PCT/US00/3I603<br><br>
to insure conversion of all acid to salt The final pH of the emulsion is between about 6 and about 9, and preferably is between 6 and 8. The bases suitable for the neutralization are alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, ammonium hydroxide or ethanolarnines. Ammonium hydroxide solution is preferred.<br>
v:&gt;<br>
An aqueous solution of the composition of this invention is used for coating substrate surfaces. The concentration of the aqueous solution used for coating substrate surfaces is conveniently measured in terms of the total fluorine content of the aqueous solution, and the fluorine contributions to the total fluorine 10     content provided by the fluorophosphate and fluoroacrylate polymer components. The fluorine content of each component is determined by analysis or calculation, as appropriate. The total fluorine content of the aqueous treating solution is     typically 0.2 to about 1.5%, and preferably 0.7 T 1.0%, for the preferred wet-on-wet coating procedure (described below). While the lower concentrations provide economy, the level of stain resistance provided is reduced. Higher concentrations increase cost and provide little or no additional protection. The amount of fluorophosphate should provide from about 20 to about 95%, and preferably 25 -85%, of the fluorine content, and the remaining fluorine content is provided by the fluoropolymer. Coatings outside these ranges provide reduced protection. 20<br>
The aqueous fluoropolymer solutions alone provide some protection to the stone and masonry substrate although the protection is reduced compared to the mixtures described above. Although the fluoropolymer coating does adhere to the stone and masonry substrates used in the following examples, it does not stick to 25     metals used in heat exchanger coils described by Terry and Mcintosh in US Patent 4,597,948.<br>
The present invention further comprises a method of improving stain resistance of substrate surfaces comprising application of the composition 30     described above. The composition of the present invention, at the application<br>
concentration and composition described above, is applied to the substrate surface by conventional means, including but not limited to, brush, spray, roller, doctor blade, wipe, and dip techniques, preferably using a two-coat wet-on-wet technique. The wet-on-wet procedure comprises applying a first coat which is<br><br>
allowed to soak into the substrate but not dry (eg., for about 10-30 minutes) and then applying a second coat The substrate is then allowed to dry under ambient conditions in the field, or the drying can be accelerated by warm air if desired. The wet-on-wet application procedure provides a means to distribute or build up more of the protective coating at the substrate surface. Single coat application techniques, while not preferred, can also be used. In such single coat applications, the total fluorine concentration in the aqueous coating can be increased up to twice while maintaining the relative fluorine contributions of the fluorophosphate and fluoropolymer components<br>
10<br>
The application concentration is prepared directly from the<br>
fiuorophosphate and fluoropolymerorby diluting apremix concentrate. Premix<br>
concentrates comprise a more concentrated aqueous solution or suspension of the<br>
fiuorophosphate and fluoropolymer in the same ratio as described above. When<br>
1 5     diluted prior to application, the total fluorine content and the contributions of the<br>
fiuorophosphate and fluoropolymer to the total fluorine content are as described<br>
above for the coating composition. Such concentrated premixes are more<br>
convenient and economical to transport and store, and are diluted with water to<br>
the application composition prior to use.<br>
20	-<br>
The present invention further comprises substrates treated according to the method of the present invention. These substrates comprise porous hard surfaced materials used in interior and exterior construction applications. Examples of such materials include concrete, brick, tile, stone, grout, mortar, terrazzo, gypsum 25     board, statuary, wood and leather. The treated substrates have improved resistance to a variety of stains including foods, oils, and acid dye stains.<br>
The compositions, method, and treated substrates of the present invention are useful in providing resistance to staining for a variety of hard surfaces used for 30     interior and exterior construction and decorative purposes. Substrates having surface porosity are especially subject to staining and often difficult to protect without altering the appearance of the surface. The present invention provides protection while permitting retention of the normal appearance of the surface.<br><br><br>
TEST METHODS<br>
Test Method 1. Detennination of stain resistance on masonry<br>
This test method describes the procedure for testing the stain resistance of stone treatments. Square tiles (12 in., or 30.5 cm, square) of three sample substrates, sandstone, limestone, and saltillo or "Mexican clay" tile, were cut into 4 in, or 10.2 cm, square samples. After cutting, the stone samples were rinsed to remove any dust or dirt and allowed to dry thoroughly, typically 3 days or more.<br>
1)<br>
Treating solutions were made by diluting the product candidates in water to the desired treating concentration. The top surfaces of the tiles were treated by dipping them into the treating solution for 10 seconds. The treated tiles were then allowed to dry overnight Dipping was chosen as the method of application to 11     achieve a more uniform treatment on the absorbent surface than is typically achieved by brushing or wiping. Test results can be sensitive to non-uniform application.<br>
The following food stains were placed at intervals on the treated and dried 20     tile surface and allowed to remain on the tile for 24 hours: 1) Corn Oil, 2)<br>
Ketchup, 3) Italian salad dressing, 4) Mustard, 5) Red wine, 6) Hot coffee (black), and 7) Grape jelly.<br>
After the 24-hour period, the food stains were blotted or lightly scraped 25     from the tile surface.  A mild surfactant solution such as 1% DAWN dishwashing liquid (Proctor &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati OH) in water, is then applied to the tile surface and a stiff bristle brush is used to scrub the surface 10 cycles back and forth. The tiles were men rinsed with water and allowed to dry before rating.<br>
3 0	The stains remaining on the tile surfaces after cleaning were rated visually<br>
as follows:<br>
14<br><br>
Rating "No,	Stain Intensity<br>
0	No stain<br>
1	Very light stain<br>
2	Light stain<br>
3	Moderate stain<br>
4	Heavy stain<br>
The ratings for each stone (limestone, sandstone and saltillo) sample were summed for each of the seven stains to give a composite rating for that stone. Thus, the maximum or worst score was 7 stains times the maximum score of 4 = 28. Lower scores indicated better stain protection with zero indicating the best protection with no stain present<br>
Test Method 2. Coating Adhesion Tests on Metals<br>
Various mixtures of fluoropolymer emulsions and fluorophosphate solutions were coated on the indicated metals using a 3-mil (0.08 mm) doctor blade, allowed to dry, cross-hatched, and tested for adhesion before and after boiling in water for 10 minutes according to the American Society for Testing Materials, ASTM D3359. Adhesion was rated as follows:<br>
Rating No.	Adhesive Intensity<br>
1	no coating removed<br>
2	about 25% of coating removed<br>
3	about 50% coating removed<br>
4	about 75 % coating removed<br>
5	all of the coating removed<br>
