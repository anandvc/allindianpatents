				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the process of<br>
manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy<br>
terminated  poly-butadiene  and  product  thereof,  more<br>
particularly it relates to the high explosive preferably in<br>
sheet form based on hydroxy-terminated poly-butadiene for<br>
metal cutting and armoured protection.<br>
The high explosives in flexible sheet form are generally manufactured using HMX, PETN or RDX as such distributed in an elastomeric matrix and crepe rubber or poly iso-butylene as binder. The methods of prior art have disadvantages as the poly-iso-butylene is difficult to manufacture and processing of crepe rubber based sheet explosive involves a high temperature rolling operation.<br>
Another disadvantage of prior-art is that the manufacturing process is potentially fire hazardous as the solvent used in the process is benzene which catches fire at the processing temperature which in turn is generally higher than its boiling temperature.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the presently known methods of manufacturing such high explosive sheet form and crepe rubber based is that the resulted product has limited shelf life, deteriorates and becomes unstable at extreme ambient conditions on storage.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the the methods known in prior art is that , they yield the products with poor mechanical and thermal properties which directly affect the end use of such resulted products.<br><br>
Still further disadvantage of the processes of prior art is that they result in shrinkage in the sheet form high explosive, which in-turn results in non-uniform thickness of the sheet and uncontrolled dimensions of the resulted high explosives in sheet form.<br>
Furthermore, because the presently known methods of prior art result in the product with shrinkage, the flexibility is reduced to a greater extent and the resulted product is not flexible enough to be easily adapted for application on any plane, curved or undulated surface.<br>
The present invention relates to a useful and improved process of manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy terminated poly butadiene and to the products of the said process with improved properties, and more particularly to a process of manufacture of high explosive based on hydroxy terminated poly butadiene.<br>
A object of the present invention is to propose a process of manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy terminated poly-butadiene, here-in-after named as HTPB, and to eliminate the disadvantages of explosives based on crepe rubber and poly-iso-butylene and of processes thereof.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process of manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy terminated poly-butadiene/ and wherein the use of low boiling solvents/ more particular/ hazardous solvents is eliminated, even more particularly the use of such solvents is totally eliminated^<br><br>
Yet another object of the present is to propose a process of manufacture high explosive based ON HTPB, wherein the resulted product has better and improved mechanical and thermal properties.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose a process of manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy terminated ploy-butadiene, and wherein the handling and drying of the high explosive is made more convenient, non hazardous, and safer than the know such processes.<br>
It is yet an object of the present invention to propose a process of manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on the HTPB having homogeneous and uniform thickness with better flexibility, strength, longer shelf life and without any shrinkage which are otherwise resulted due to the use of know reactants i.e. crepe rubber or polyisobutylene, and are overcome in the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on hydroxy terminated poly-butadiene (HTPB), comprising the steps of (i) reacting high explosive selected from RDX, HMX, PETN preferably RDX of particle size 5-30 micron, with distilled water in ratio between 1:5 to 1:15 by weight, in an aluminum container, (ii) constantly stirring the reaction mixture and addition of 2 to 7% by weight of dioctylphthalate (DOP), drop by drop to the reaction mixture, (iii) stirring continuously preferably upto 5-10 minutes after addition of DOP, (iv) Alteration of the reaction mixture in a Alteration unit, which preferably comprising a coarse cambric cloth bag to drain out the unreacted water, (v) drying of the reacted mixture by decanting and centrifuging, (vi) air drying of the reacted mixture comprising RDX coated with DOP in drying trays, (vii) reaction of 6-18% by weight of HTPB with 2-12% by weight of DOP in presence of a catalyst such as ferric acetyl acetonate equal to 0.005% by weight of HTPB in a steam jacketed sigma-blade mixture for 15 to 30 minutes, at 40 to 60°C, (viii) addition of the said dried RDX coated with DOP to the reaction and maintaining vacuum preferably equivalent to 10 to 20 mm of mercury for preferably 50 to 70 minutes at 40 to 50°C temperature, (ix) addition of di-isocynate equal<br><br>
to 7 to 12% by weight of HTPB to the reaction mixture, (x) release of vacuum, stirring of the reaction mixture upto 20 to 30 minutes and partial curing of the reaction mixture under controlled humidity preferably 45 to 60%, (xi) rolling of the cured reaction mixture into flexible explosive sheets by passing between two rollers of vertical rolling machine, 90 minutes after completion of the said reactions, wherein the gap between the said roller is kept 12 to 18 mm initially which is subsequently reduced to the desired thickness of the flexible explosive sheet, (xii) cutting the flexible explosive sheets into sheets of desired size using brass knife and drying under controlled humidity to obtain the flexible sheet explosive based on HTPB.<br>
Other objects and further applicability of the present invention will become more apparent when taken in conjunction with accompanied description and working examples.<br>
According to the present invention the process for manufacture of flexible sheet explosive based on HTPB is proposed comprising of reaction of high explosives such as RDX, HMX, PETN preferably RDX of particle size 5-30 micron, more particularly 5-15 micron with distilled water in ratio of 5 to 13 times by weight more preferably in ratio of 1:0 to 10.0 by weight, in an aluminium container, under constant stirring and uniform suspension is maintained by stirring. To this reaction mixture, DOP is added dropwise preferably from the connected separating funnel and stirring is continued preferably upto 5-10 min after addition of 2-7% by weight of DOP more preferably 3-6% by weight of DOP. The reacted mixture is poured into Alteration unit, which is preferably a coarse cambric cloth bag to drain out the<br><br>
unreacted water. The last traces of unreacted water are 'decanted off after centrifuging the reacted mixture contained in the said bag. On complete removal of unreacted water, the reacted mixture RDX coated with DOP is transferred to drying trays and is air dried avoiding the risk of hazardous treatment due to room temperature treatment.<br>
The second step according to the disclosed process of the present invention comprises of reaction of 6-18% by weight preferably 7-13% by weight of HTPB with 2-12% by weight, preferably 4-9% by weight of DOP in the presence of 0.005% by weight of HTPB of ferric acetyl acetonate which in turn acts as catalyst and enhances the reaction rate and results in higher yields on curing, in a steam jacketed sigma-blade mixer for 15 to 30 min, more preferably for 15 to 20 min at 40 to 60 deg C more preferably at 45 to 50 deg C, thus avoiding wastage of time and high temperature treatment. To this reacted mixture, RDX coated with DOP is added and vacuum preferably of 10mm to 20mm Hg is applied for preferably 50 to 70 min at 40 to 50 deg C temperature. Once the second step reaction is complete the di-isocynate in 7 to 12% by weight of HTPB is added to same reaction vessel and vacuum is released, stirring is continued for 20-30 min, preferably upto 20 min. The reacted mixture is kept for partial curing under controlled relative humidity preferably 4 5 to 60 % and then rolled to result in sheet form between two rollers of a vertical rolling machine after of about 90 min of completion of the said reaction. The<br><br>
rolling is performed initially by maintaining gap between the two rollers at 12-18 mm preferably 12 to 14 mm and subsequently gap is narrowed down to the desired thickness of the sheet and which in turn results in uniform thickness and avoided shrinkage, which is also avoided due to controlled partial curing at controlled relative humidity. The yielded sheet form explosive can be cut into the desired size using preferably a brass knife and a temperature. The explosive is allowed to dry under controlled humidity preferably after rolling into sheet form and cutting into desired size.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the reaction scheme as of the accompanying drawing shown in fig l./and by the following examples which are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
