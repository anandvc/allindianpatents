This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/727,568 (Attorney Docket No. 2005P18879US), filed October 17, 2005<br>
and entitled "Adaptive Temporal Filtering for Low-dose X-ray Sequences", the<br>
content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for reducing noise<br>
in image sequences.<br>
2.	Discussion of Related Art<br>
In recent years, medical imaging has experienced an explosive growth<br>
due to advances in imaging modalities such as X-rays, computed tomography<br>
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and fluoroscopy.<br>
Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by clinicians to obtain<br>
real-time images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a<br>
fluoroscope. Fluoroscopic techniques can be utilized to maneuver certain<br>
instruments to diagnose and treat a patient.<br>
While fluoroscopy is widely accepted as an anatomical guide utilized<br>
during minimally invasive and microscopic surgical procedures, as well as<br>
many types of diagnostic tests, because it involves the use of X-rays, a form of<br><br>
ionizing radiation, fluoroscopic procedures pose a potential health risk to the<br>
patient and staff in the X-ray room. While low dose rates are generally used<br>
during fluoroscopy procedures, the length of a typical procedure can result in a<br>
relatively high absorbed dose to the patient. Staff dose, arising from scattered<br>
radiation, due to X-ray photons scattered from the patient, objects or structures<br>
in the beam can accumulate to appreciable levels over a working year.<br>
Reduction of the dose rate used would be of benefit to the patient and staff in<br>
the X-ray room.<br>
Dose reduction programs in fluoroscopy have been undertaken with the<br>
aim of reducing radiation dose to the staff and patients. While reducing X-ray<br>
scatter via dose reduction strategies can reduce the overall amount of scatter<br>
in the room, these methods reduce image quality. In general, the extent to<br>
which X-ray dose can be reduced is governed by the image quality required by<br>
the clinician to effectively perform a particular clinical task. It is difficult to<br>
significantly reduce the dose rate, yet retain sufficient image quality in the<br>
displayed fluoroscopic image.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
In view of the motion and lighting change along the X-ray frames, the<br>
current image may be classified into two groups: static group and outlier group.<br>
For pixels in the static group, their intensity changes are mainly caused by<br>
lighting changes and noises. For pixels in the outlier group, their intensities<br>
vary with the object motion. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention, temporal filtering is implemented for the static group and<br>
spatial filtering is conducted for outliers to reduce noise level for both of two<br>
groups.<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart showing a method of reducing noise in an image<br>
sequence, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, in step 110, detect structures in an image sequence. For<br>
example, detecting structures in the image sequence may comprise feature<br>
detection and classification.<br>
The shape and size of objects of interest may be known, such as for<br>
example, catheters and guide wires, but not the orientations of the objects.<br>
Line-shape kernels can be applied in different orientations to convolute with the<br>
input image. To save the computation cost, four kernels in four main directions<br>
may be used, for example, when 6 is equal to 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees,<br>
respectively. Three of the four kernels may result from the rotation of the first<br>
kernel with 0 = 0 degrees. Bilinear interpolation may be used to obtain the<br>
values at integer coordinates. In real-time implementations, first the image<br>
pyramids may be constructed, and then the directional convolutions can be<br>
done in the coast level, which may reduce the computation cost.<br><br>
After directional convolution operations, take the absolute value of<br>
convolution results. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
maximum of four absolute convolution results are chosen for each pixel. The<br>
structure detection results may be achieved with a thresholding operation.<br>
The threshold may be chosen empirically, but could be decided automatically<br>
once the signal noise ratio is estimated. The structure detection result may be<br>
binary. A smoothed version can be created with a continuous transfer function<br>
instead of simple thresholding.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a block diagram illustrating a method of structure detection,<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For the first<br>
kernel which orients at θ = 0 degrees, set the intensity of pixels within the<br>
black region to 1, and set the value to 0 for the rest of the pixels. The width<br>
and length of the black bar may favor the structure of interest. For example,<br>
the width x length of the black bar may be 13 x 5 pixels. The input image can<br>
be an image or image difference. For less memory usage and reduced<br>
computation, the convolution results may be measured for each frame. The<br>
convolution results of image differences can be acquired by subtraction of<br>
convolution results of corresponding frames.<br>
In a method of reducing noise in an image sequence, according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention described in connection with<br>
FIG. 1, after detecting structures in an image sequence, in step 120, estimate<br>
lighting changes in the image sequence and compensate for the estimated<br>
lighting changes. For example, estimating lighting changes in the image<br><br>
sequence may comprise calculating image differences on consecutive frames.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, estimating<br>
lighting changes in the image sequence and compensating for the estimated<br>
lighting changes comprises calculating image differences on consecutive<br>
frames, and compensating for differences caused by the moving structures in<br>
the image sequence.<br>
In step 130, detect moving structures in the image sequence using the<br>
detected structures after compensating for the estimated lighting changes in<br>
the image sequence. For example, detecting moving structures in the image<br>
sequence may be based on image differences after compensating for the<br>
estimated lighting changes in the image sequence.<br>
In step 140, imaging noise in the image sequence is adaptively filtered<br>
based on the moving structure detection. For example, by utilizing the moving<br>
structures detection result, the image sequence may be adaptively filtered to<br>
increase the signal noise ratio while preserving the structures of interest. The<br>
adaptive filtering may be used to reduce the imaging noise on every image<br>
frame, including both static and outlier regions, in the image sequence. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the imaging noise in static<br>
regions and moving regions are filtered differently. For outlier regions, wherein<br>
the pixel correspondence between frames cannot be easily established, an<br>
accurate estimate the motion vector for each pixel can be utilized. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, detection of the moving<br>
regions includes finding the regions where motion is not zero, and using spatial<br><br>
filtering to reduce the imaging noise. The spatial filtering may rely on pixels on<br>
the same frame instead of corresponding pixels between frames. Filtering will<br>
be described later in this disclosure.<br>
There are several mechanisms that cause temporal changes along the<br>
X-ray sequence, such as for example, motion, lighting change and noise. To<br>
detect outliers more accurately, according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, lighting change are estimated and then excluded from<br>
temporal image difference.<br>
Lighting estimation may be measured with image differences. The<br>
image differences include lighting change, motion and noise. For the<br>
purposes of this disclosure, detection of the significant change that is likely due<br>
to motion is referred to as "loose outlier" detection.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a block diagram illustrating a method of loose outlier<br>
detection, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The loose outlier detection is based on two image differences with the<br>
procedure shown in FIG. 3. The circles labeled "SUB" in FIG. 3 denote image<br>
subtraction. As described above with regard to structure detection, the<br>
convolution results (A1, A2, A3, A4) are computed in four directions when<br>
the frame at time t is available. On the other hand, the convolution results<br>
(B1, B2, B3, B4) for the frame at time t-1 and those (C1, C2, C3, C4) for<br>
the frame at time f-2 may be saved. The images A1 through A4 are<br>
subtracted by B1 through B4 , respectively, and the differences are called<br><br>
SAB1 through SAB4 . SAC1 through SAC4 are generated by subtracting<br>
C1 through C4 from A1 through A4. The above-described procedure yields<br>
two series of image groups, that is, SAB1 through SAB4 (group 1) and<br>
SAC1 through SAC4 (group 2). For group 1, compare the intensity pixel by<br>
pixel for the four images and find out the intensity with the largest absolute<br>
value for each pixel. The operation is called MAX_ABS and the image created<br>
is MAB. For group 2, perform MAX_ABS and obtain image MAC. Then,<br>
conduct thresholding for the minimum of the absolute values of MAB and<br>
those of MAC pixel by pixel and output the binary result image LO, where a<br>
result of 0 represents outlier. The threshold in loose outlier detection may be<br>
higher than the one used in outlier detection.<br>
After the completion of loose outlier detection, the loose outliers are<br>
excluded from both of the image differences, which are denoted by Dif1 and<br>
Dif2, where Dif1 = lmgt-lmgt-1 and Dif2 = Imgt-Imgt-2. The image<br>
differences with loose outliers excluded are denoted by Dif1' and Dif2*, as<br>
follows: Dif1 = Dif1 dotproduct LO and Dif2* = Dif2 dotproduct LO.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an averaging<br>
kernel with a size of 129 x 129 pixels is employed to filter Dif 1* and Dif2*. It<br>
is to be understood that averaging kernels of various sizes may be employed to<br>
filter Dif1* and Dif2* . For example, to capture slower variations, an<br>
averaging kernel with a large size may be employed to filter Dift and DifT.<br>
To speed up computation, integral images may be used for averaging.<br>
This allows the computation of averaging with a small, constant number of<br><br>
Outlier detection is similar to loose outlier detection except that lighting<br>
changes are compensated and a stricter threshold is chosen. FIG. 4 shows a<br>
block diagram illustrating a method of outlier detection, according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, once convolution results are obtained out of the two<br>
image differences Dif1 and Dif2, the value of the result that has the biggest<br>
absolute value pixel by pixel is recorded, which produces two recorded image<br>
as MAB and MAC in FIG. 3. The corresponding lighting estimation images<br>
are subtracted from the recorded images. A pixel-by-pixel comparison is<br>
made of the absolute value of MAB-Light1 and that of MAC-Light2. For<br>
each pixel, the smaller value is used for thresholding. The result can be binary.<br>
The result can be a map to multi-value using a lookup table.<br>
Frequency decomposition helps to reduce the light change effect, and<br>
will be discussed later in this disclosure. Since the line-shape structures and<br>
their neighbor pixels can counteract each other, the contrast of the structure<br>
may be blurred after temporal filtering. The removal of line structure before<br>
decomposition, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, includes the following two steps. First, detect the line structure.<br>
This can be done by comparison between the MAX_ABS result of four<br>
directional convolutions for the current image and mean value within local<br>
window. The pixel is regarded as line structure if the difference is large<br>
enough. The second step is to replace each line structure pixel with its local<br><br>
additions/subtractions per pixel and may yield a significant increase in speed.<br>
Due to loose outlier exclusion, the averaging result may be normalized, and<br>
then divided by the number of pixels included in the corresponding 129 x 129<br>
window. " Two lighting estimation images Light1 and Light2 may be<br>
employed. For example, Light1 represents the lighting changes pixel by pixel<br>
between the frames at times t and t-1, and Light2 represents the lighting<br>
changes between frames at times t and t-2.	For example,<br>
Light2 = Norm {Dif1* AvgKernel) and Light2 = Norm (Dif2* * AvgKernel),<br>
where * denotes convolution.<br>
For outlier detection and temporal filtering, pixels in the current image<br>
Imgt at time t may be divided into two groups: static group and outlier group.<br>
The static group represents the pixels that are not moving in the sequence,<br>
while the outlier group contains the pixels that belong to the moving structures.<br>
For the static group, apply the frequency decomposition, which separates<br>
the image into a low-frequency component and a high-frequency component.<br>
The low-frequency component is kept during temporal filtering, while the high-<br>
frequency component at time t averages with the one at time t-1 or f-2,<br>
whichever is closer. To avoid the negative effect of structure blurring due to<br>
the decomposition under some circumstances, the structure detection and<br>
replacement can be used before the decomposition procedure. For the outlier<br>
group, the steps are simpler. Spatial filtering with a small kernel is<br>
implemented to keep the signal noise ratio aligned with the one in the static<br>
group.<br><br>
mean value. Then low-pass filter is applied to obtain the low-frequency<br>
component based on the replaced image.<br>
As mentioned above, temporal lighting changes exist along some<br>
frames. For pixels in static group, temporal filtering results will be affected by<br>
lighting change. But. spatial filtering is used for outlier group, which is only<br>
related to current frame. This different treatment makes these two groups<br>
have different light conditions. A solution is to separate every frame into a low-<br>
frequency component and a high-frequency component, where<br>
Imgt(x,y) = lmgLowf(x,y) + ImgHight(x,y) . According to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, temporal filtering is applied on the high<br>
frequency component, while the current low frequency component is not<br>
filtered. Lighting information may mainly exist in the low frequency component,<br>
and light change may not be involved in temporal filtering.<br>
The static region and outlier region may have different characters, and<br>
may be treated differently. For a pixel at (x,y), regarded as static,<br><br><br>
The spatial filtering, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, enables the signal noise ratio of filtering results for pixels<br>
regarded as outliers to be consistent with that for static pixels.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention may be implemented in<br>
various forms of hardware, software, firmware, special purpose processors, or<br>
a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the present invention may be<br>
implemented in software as an application program tangibly embodied on a<br>
