				<td>COMPOSITIONS OF CHKl INHIBITORS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising a Chkl inhibitor. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions comprising (a) a Chkl inhibitor and (b) a cyclodextrin; methods of treating a cancer and/or potentiating a cancer treatment using these compositions; and methods of treating non-cancerous disorders involving aberrantly proliferating cells using these compositions.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
The biochemical, physiological, and clinical effects of Chkl inhibitors suggest their utility in a variety of disease states in which modulation of Chkl and control of the cell cycle is desired. See Sanchez et al, Science, 277: 1497 (1997); Chen et al, Oncogene, 18:249 (1999); Lui et al., Genes Dev., 14: 1448 (2000); Tenzer et al., Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents, 3:35 (2003); and Mack et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol, 51(4):337 (2003). Such disease states include cancers and diseases involving non-cancerous, aberrantly proliferating cells, such as psoriasis, renal disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.<br><br>
Chkl inhibitors have been disclosed, including aryl- and heteroaryl-substituted urea compounds; methylxanthines and related compounds; ureidothiophenes; N- pyrrolopyridinyl carboxamides; antisense Chkl oligonucleotides; Chkl receptor antagonists; heteroaromatic carboxamide derivatives; aminothiophenes; (indazolyl)benzimidazoles; benzimidazole quinolinones; heterocyclic -hydroxyimino-fluorenes; scytoneman derivatives, such as scytonemin; heteroarylbenzamides; indazoles; indolacarbazoles; chromane derivatives; paullones; indenopyrazoles; flavones; peptide derivatives of peptide loop of serine threonine kinases; oxindoles; diazepinoindolones; pyrimidines; urea compounds; pyrrolocarbazoles; benzofuroisoindoles; and azacyclopentafluorenes.<br><br>
The therapeutic benefit of Chkl inhibitors can be achieved through administration to a subject in need thereof, but the routes of the administration and the associated vehicles used have not been sufficiently investigated. The poor solubility of many Chkl inhibitors has impeded the development of pharmaceutically acceptable means of administering these compounds. Additionally, some Chkl inhibitors have been shown exhibit side effects such as hemolysis in animal models. Moreover, some Chkl inhibitors are unstable in certain formulations and can degrade to inactive, or more concerning, toxic derivatives, prior to or during administration, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of the Chkl inhibitor for its intended purpose. <br><br>
Thus, there remains a need for compositions containing Chkl inhibitors that provide sufficient solubility and stability, while minimizing undesired side effects. The present disclosure addresses such concerns.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
The present invention provides compositions comprising (a) at least one Chkl inhibitor and (b) at least one cyclodextrin; methods of treating a cancer and/or potentiating a cancer treatment using these compositions; and methods of treating diseases involving noncancerous, aberrantly proliferating cells using these compositions.<br><br>
Therefore, one aspect of the invention provides compositions comprising (a) at least one Chkl inhibitor and (b) at least one cyclodextrin. In various embodiments, the Chkl inhibitors can be disubstituted urea compounds, wherein each nitrogen (N and N') of the urea moiety is monosubstituted and each substituent is optionally substituted and selected from the group consisting of aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, and Ci_6 alkyl substituted with a heteroaryl or aryl moiety. Specific disubstituted urea compounds include those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,067,506; WO 06/012308; WO 06/014359; WO 06/021002; International Patent Application No. PCT/US06/11584; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/818,008, filed June 30, 2006; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0014765; WO 03/101444; U.S. Patent No. 7,056,925; WO 04/014876; WO 06/0725891; WO 05/215556; Fan et al, Cancer Res. 55: 1649 (1995); WO 03/029241; WO 03/028731; WO 03/028724; WO 01/57206; U.S. Patent No. 6,211,164; WO 04/004785; WO 00/16781; WO 03/037886; WO 03/029242; WO 03/004488; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0092535; WO 04/018419; WO 02/16326; U.S. Patent No. 6,495,586; WO 01/53274; WO 01/53268; Tenzer et al., Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents , 3:35 (2003); WO 02/070515; Schultz, et al., J. Med. Chem., 42:2909 (1999); WO 99/17769; Sedlacek et al., Int. J. Oncol. 9: 1143 (1996); WO 98/53050; WO 03/051838; WO 04/063198; WO 04/048343; WO 03/091255; WO 06/074281; WO 02/100356; WO 04/002481; WO 03/093297; WO 05/103036; WO 05/16909; WO 04/97426; WO 04/87707; WO 05/9435); WO 06/74281; and WO 06/74207, each incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In various embodiments, the cyclodextrins are a-cyclodextrins, ß- cyclodextrins, ?-cyclodextrins, and/or d-cyclodextrins. In some embodiments, the cyclodextrins are modified cyclodextrins. Specific modifications include, but are not limited to, hydroxyalkyl ethers and sulfoalkyl ethers. In some embodiments, the modified cyclodextrins are sulfobutylether-1-ß-cyclodextrin, sulfobutylether-4-ß-cyclodextrin, <br><br>
sulfobutylether-7-ß-cyclodextrin, and/or hydroxypropylether ß-cyclodextrin. In one embodiment, the modified cyclodextrin comprises sulfobutylether-7-ß-cyclodextrin.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein can have a mole ratio of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin of up to the total number of complexation sites available on the cyclodextrin. In other embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein can have a mole ratio of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin greater than the total number of complexation sites available on the cyclodextrin. The structure of the cyclodextrin will influence the maximum number of sites for complexation. In various embodiments, the mole ratio of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin is up to about 9: 1. In other embodiments, the mole ratio of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin is up to about 5: 1. In still other embodiments, the mole ratio of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin is at least about 1:2.<br><br>
The present compositions can be administered to a subject in need thereof via a variety of routes. In specific embodiments, the route of administration is dermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, pulmonal, buccal, sublingual, nasal, via inhalation, percutaneous, vaginal, oral, parenteral, rectal, intravenous, topical, intradermal, ophthalmic, and/or intraperitoneal.<br><br>
The disclosed compositions can further include a pH adjusting agent and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Specific pH adjusting agents include, but are not limited to, buffers, acids, and bases. In some embodiments, the pH of the composition, when in an aqueous solution, is from about 2 to about 8. In various embodiments, the pH of the composition, when in an aqueous solution, is from about 3 to about 5. In some embodiments, the pH of the solution is from about 4 to about 4.7.<br><br>
In various embodiments, the compositions of the invention are substantially anhydrous. In some embodiments, the amount of water in the compositions is less than about 5%, based upon the total weight of the composition. In various embodiments, the amount of water is less than about 2%. In still other embodiments, the amount of water is less than about 1%. In some embodiments, the compositions are lyophilized and/or spray-dried.<br><br>
In other embodiments, the present compositions also are in liquid form, using, e.g., an aqueous and/or an alcohol or other organic solvent solution. Regardless of the form of the compositions, for routes of administration requiring a liquid formulation, solid forms of the composition are typically reconstituted, dissolved, or diluted in a suitable liquid carrier prior to administration to an individual. <br><br>
The present compositions also can include one or more additional active ingredients as determined by, e.g., a medical professional. Nonlimiting examples of contemplated additional active ingredients include an antiemetic agent, a cytoprotective agent, an antinecrotic agent, an imaging agent, an anticancer agent, and an agent suitable for treating non-cancerous indications involving aberrantly proliferating cells. In some embodiments, the anticancer agent is a Chkl activator.<br><br>
Another aspect of the invention provides methods of potentiating a cancer treatment or treating a cancer by administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an anticancer agent and a therapeutically effective amount of a composition disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the anticancer agent and the composition disclosed herein are administered sequentially, while in other embodiments, the anticancer agent and the composition are administered simultaneously. In specific embodiments, the anticancer agent is administered prior to the compositions disclosed herein.<br><br>
In some embodiments, when an anticancer agent and a Chkl inhibitor are administered to an individual, either from the same formulation or in a sequential or simultaneous manner from different formulations, the amount of administered anticancer agent can be reduced compared to the amount of the same anticancer agent that would be required in the absence of the Chkl inhibitor to achieve a comparable therapeutic result. Therefore, in some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the anticancer agent, when based upon simultaneous or sequential use of a Chkl inhibitor, is less than a therapeutically effective amount of the same anticancer agent in the absence of administration of the Chkl inhibitor.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the anticancer agent is a Chkl activator. In various embodiments, the anticancer agent is a chemotherapeutic, a radiotherapeutic, or both. In specific embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent can be an alkylating agent, an antimetabolite, a hormone or antagonist thereof, an antibody, or mixtures thereof. The chemotherapeutic agent can be, for example, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, cisplatin, methotrexate, trimetrexate, or mixtures thereof. Examples of alkylating agents include nitrogen mustards, such as mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan, or chlorambucil. Other examples of chemotherapeutics include nitrosoureas, such as carmustine, lomustine, or semustine; ethylenimines and/or methyl-melamines, such as triethylenemelamine, triethylene thiophosphoramide, or hexamethylmelamine; alkyl sulfonates, such as busulfan; and triazines, such as dacarbazine. Other anticancer agents include antimetabolites, such as folic acid analogs (e.g., methotrexate, trimetrexate, or <br><br>
pemetrexed); pyrimidine analogs (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, fluorodeoxyuridine, gemcitabine, cytosine arabinoside, 5-azacytidine, or 2,2'-difluorodeoxycytidine); purine analogs (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, 2'-deoxycoformycin, erythrohydroxynonyladenine, a fludarabine salt, or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine); and/or type I topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., camptothecin, topotecan, or irinotecan). In some embodiments, the anticancer agent can be derived from a natural product, such as epipodophylotoxins (e.g., etoposide or teniposide); and/or vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine, or vinorelbine). In certain embodiments, the anticancer agent can be an antibiotic, such as actinomycin D, doxorubicin, or bleomycin. In various embodiments, the anticancer agent can be a radiosensitizer, such as 5-bromodeoxyuridine, 5-iododeoxyuridine, or bromodeoxycytidine. In some embodiments, the anticancer agent can be a platinum coordination complex, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. The anticancer agent can be hydroxyurea and/or a methylhydrazine derivative, such as N-methylhydrazine or procarbazine. In some embodiments, radiotherapeutic agent can be gamma-radiation, X-ray radiation, ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation, infrared radiation, and microwave radiation.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
Disclosed herein are compositions comprising (a) a Chkl inhibitor and (b) a cyclodextrin. More particularly, disclosed herein are compositions comprising at least one Chkl inhibitor and at least one cyclodextrin, and methods of treating a cancer or potentiating a cancer treatment via administration of these compositions to an individual in need thereof. Further disclosed herein are methods of treating diseases involving non-cancerous, aberrantly <br><br>
proliferating cells via administration of a present composition to an individual in need thereof.<br><br>
Chkl inhibitors have been found to be effective in cancer treatments protocols when tested in animals, but have exhibited undesirable side effects and/or low solubility.<br><br>
It has been discovered that, in various embodiments, a composition comprising at least one Chkl inhibitor and at least one cyclodextrin increases solubility of the Chkl inhibitor in water, and/or decreases toxicity of the Chkl inhibitor toward untargeted cells (e.g., endothelial cells), and/or enhances the stability of the Chkl inhibitor prior to administration and/or upon administration to an individual in need thereof.<br><br>
Chkl Inhibitors<br><br>
"Chkl inhibitor" means any agent, whether now known or after-discovered, whether naturally occurring, isolated from nature, or man-made, that is capable of at least partially abrogating cell cycle checkpoint activity of Chkl. Such agents can be alternatively referred to as "capable of inhibiting Chkl." Such agents include, but are not limited to, small molecule compounds, biologies, and antisense agents. One specific example of a class of Chkl inhibitors is a disubstituted urea compound, wherein each nitrogen of the urea compound is substituted with one or more aryl and/or heteroaryl moieties.<br><br>
If more than one Chkl inhibitor is used, the Chkl inhibitors can be coadministered or administered at separate times as determined by the attending physician or laboratory technician. One way to determine Chkl inhibitor activity is by assessing Chkl activity, both in the presence and absence of the suspected Chkl inhibitor. Such assessments are readily apparent to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,067,506, incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Compounds useful in the present invention as Chkl inhibitors include, but are not limited to, disubstituted ureas. Disubstituted ureas, as used herein, refers to urea compounds having one substituent at each nitrogen (N and N') wherein each substituent is optionally substituted and selected from the group consisting of aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, and Ci_6 alkyl substituted with a heteroaryl or aryl moiety. In some embodiments, the urea compounds comprise two aryl substituents, while in other embodiments, the urea compounds comprise one aryl and one heteroaryl substituent, and in still other embodiment, the urea compounds comprise two heteroaryl substituents. Specific examples of disubstituted ureas include, but are not limited to, those described or claimed in the following publications, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by <br><br>

Cyclodextrin derivatives suitable for use herein include hydroxypropyl a- cyclodextrin, methylated a-cyclodextrin, methylated ß-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl ß- cyclodextrin, and hydroxypropyl ß-cyclodextrin. Hydroxyalkyl cyclodextrin derivatives preferably have a degree of substitution/modification of from about 1 to about 14, more preferably from about 1.5 to about 7, wherein the total number of OR groups per cyclodextrin is defined as the degree of substitution/modification. Methylated cyclodextrin derivatives typically have a degree of substitution/modification of from about 1 to about 18, preferably from about 3 to about 16. A known methylated ß-cyclodextrin is heptakis-2,6-di-O-methyl- b-cyclodextrin, commonly known as DIMEB, in which each glucose unit has about 2 methyl groups with a degree of substitution of about 14. Another commercially available cyclodextrin which can be used in the disclosed compositions is methylated ß-cyclodextrin, a randomly methylated ß-cyclodextrin, commonly known as RAMEB, having different degrees of substitution, normally of about 12.6.<br><br>
Other modified cyclodextrins are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,426,011; 3,453,257; 3,453,258; 3,453,259; 3,453,260; 3,459,731; 3,453,257; 3,420,788; 3,426,011; 3,553,191; 3,565,887; 4,535,152; 4,616,008; 4,638,058; 4,678,598; 4,727,064; 4,746,734; 5,376,645; 5,134,127; 5,376,645; 5,602,112; 5,804,568; 5,824,668; 5,874,418; <br><br>
6,046,177; 6,048,845; 6,133,248; 6,136,846; 6,218,374; 6,284,747; 6,509,370; 6,583,125; and 6,982,253, each incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br><br>
Modified cyclodextrins particularly suitable include hydroxyalkylether cyclodextrins, such as hydroxypropylether, and sulfobutylether (SBE) cyclodextrins, such as SBE-1-ß-cyclodextrin, SBE-4-ß-cyclodextrin, and SBE-7-ß-cyclodextrin, where the 1, 4, and 7 designations indicate the average degree of substitution/modification of the cyclodextrin (available from CyDex, Inc. of Overland Park, KS USA). A specific cyclodextrin is SBE-7 ß-cyclodextrin, sold under the trademark CAPTISOL® (hereinafter "Captisol") by CyDex, Inc., Lenexa Kansas, U.S.A.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "degree of substitution/modification," as it relates to cyclodextrin derivatives, refers to the total number of OR groups per cyclodextrin molecule. It is understood that commercially available cyclodextrin derivatives actually contain individual cyclodextrin molecules having varying degrees of substitution/modification. For example, hydroxypropyl ß-cyclodextrin having an average degree of substitution of 3 still contains an amount of non-derivatized ß-cyclodextrin of about 5%, while hydroxypropyl ß- cyclodextrin having an average degree of substitution of about 5 has an amount of non- derivatized beta-cyclodextrin of less than about 1%. The term "average degree of substitution/modification" thus relates to the average statistical distribution of individual substituted/modified cyclodextrin molecules of a given cyclodextrin derivative.<br><br>
Cyclodextrins can complex with guest molecules, due in part to its cyclic molecular structure. The molecular structure can be analogized to that of a doughnut, e.g., a configuration, such as a truncated cone or cylinder, with a cavity or hole in its center. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the guest molecules to be complexed are trapped within the hole or cavity of the cyclodextrin molecules and/or are associated with the side chains of the cyclodextrin, off the "doughnut" core, and held there through some binding mechanism or mechanisms, such as electrostatic interactions or Van der Waals interactions. The size of the hole or cavity, both its diameter and depth, is influenced by the number of sugar units in the cyclodextrin molecule. For instance, ?-cyclodextrin has two more sugar units than a-cyclodextrin, which corresponds both to a larger diameter and to a greater number of possible sites for complexation. Additionally, for modified cyclodextrins, the number of modifications, as well as the chemical and/or physical properties of those modifications, can influence the possible number of complexation sites. To illustrate, the maximum number of guest molecules that can complex to unmodified ?-cyclodextrin is about 9, while the maximum number for unmodified ß-cyclodextrin is about 8. With modified <br><br>
cyclodextrins, which can have complexation sites on the side chains of the cyclodextrin, the maximum number of guest molecules can change. Therefore, the maximum number of guest molecules that can complex to a particular cyclodextrin depends upon the number of sugar units of the cyclodextrin, the number and identity of any modification to the cyclodextrin, and the structure and/or size of the guest molecule.<br><br>
As used herein, "complexation" refers to a non-covalent interaction between the Chkl inhibitor (the "guest molecule") and the cyclodextrin. This interaction can occur within the cavity of the cyclodextrin, on a side chain of the cyclodextrin, or at both sites. The interaction between the Chkl inhibitor and the cyclodextrin preferably is reversible to allow for de-complexation, or release, of the Chkl inhibitor and delivery of the Chkl inhibitor to the desired target, e.g., a serum protein, cancer cells, tumor, or the like.<br><br>
The amount of cyclodextrin in a composition disclosed herein may be widely adjusted to achieve desired physical characteristics. Such characteristics include, but are not limited to: increased solubility of the Chkl inhibitor; decreased toxicity of the Chkl inhibitor to undesired targets; and/or increased stability of the Chkl inhibitor in the composition. Therefore, the amount of cyclodextrin can be determined by an effect on one or more of the above-mentioned proprieties in the composition. Methods for measuring one or more such characteristics are within the level of skill possessed by the ordinary artisan and/or by methods described herein or incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Typically, a Chkl inhibitor is present in the composition in an amount from about 0.01% to about 50% by weight. In specific embodiments, the Chkl is present in an amount from about 0.1% to about 20%, from about 0.1% to about 15%, or from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight. Specific weight percentages of Chkl inhibitor present in a composition of the present invention include about 0.2%, about 0.3%, about 0.4%, about 0.5%, about 0.6%, about 0.7%, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 4%, about 5%, about 6%, about 7%, about 8%, about 9%, about 10%, about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, about 16%, about 17%, about 18%, about 19%, about 20%, about 21%, about 22%, about 23%, about 24%, about 25%, about 26%, about 27%, about 28%, about 29%, about 30%, about 31%, about 32%, about 33%, about 34%, about 35%, about 36%, about 37%, about 38%, about 39%, about 40%, about 41%, about 42%, about 43%, about 44%, about 45%, about 46%, about 47%, about 48%, and about 49% by weight. <br><br>

Specific weight percentages of cyclodextrin present in a composition of the present invention include about 30%, about 31%, about 32%, about 33%, about 34%, about 35%, about 36%, about 37%, about 38%, about 39%, about 40%, about 41%, about 42%, about 43%, about 44%, about 45%, about 46%, about 47%, about 48%, about 49%, about 50%, about 51%, about 52%, about 53%, about 54%, about 55%, about 56%, about 57%, about 58%, about 59%, about 60%, about 61%, about 62%, about 63%, about 64%, about 65%, about 66%, about 67%, about 68%, about 69%, about 70%, about 71%, about 72%, about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about 84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, and about 90% by weight.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the amount of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin in the composition is sufficient to provide a composition wherein at least about 50% by weight of the Chkl inhibitor is complexed with the cyclodextrin. In various embodiments, greater than 60% by weight, greater than 75% by weight, greater than 90% by weight, and greater than 95% by weight of the Chkl inhibitor is complexed with a cyclodextrin in the composition. Specific weight percentages of complexed Chkl inhibitor to a cyclodextrin in the composition include greater than about 55%, greater than about 60%, greater than about 65%, greater than about 70%, greater than about 75%, greater than about 80%, greater than about 85%, greater than about 90%, greater than about 91%, greater than about 92%, greater than about 93%, greater than about 94%, greater than about 95%, greater than about 96%, greater than about 97%, greater than about 98%, and greater than about 99%, based on the total weight of Chkl inhibitor in the composition. The amount of uncomplexed Chkl inhibitor can be assessed by determination of the association constant (Ka), which can be measured via a variety of techniques known to those of skill in the art, including calorimetry experiments and solubility measurements.<br><br>
The number of moles of at least one Chkl inhibitor that complex to one mole of cyclodextrin in the compositions disclosed herein can be as great as the maximum number of complexation sites on the cyclodextrin. In some embodiments, the mole ratio of the at least one Chkl inhibitor ranges from at least about 1 : 1 to at least about n: 1, where n represents the total number of complexation sites of the cyclodextrin. Where more than one cyclodextrin is present in the composition, n may be taken to represent the average total number of complexation sites of the cyclodextrins present. As mentioned above, in some <br><br>
embodiments, the at least one Chkl inhibitor comprises at least one disubstituted urea compound. In some embodiments, specific mole ratios of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin include up to about 9 : 1 , up to about 8 : 1 , up to about 7 : 1 , up to about 6 : 1 , up to about 5 : 1 , up to about 4: 1 , up to about 3 : 1 , up to about 2: 1, and up to about 1 : 1. Other mole ratio ranges include from about 1 : 1 to about 5:1; from about 1 : 1 to about 4:1; from about 1 : 1 to about 3:1; and from about 1 : 1 to about 2: 1. Further contemplated mole ratios of Chkl inhibitor to cyclodextrin include about 1:2, about 1 :3, and about 1:4.<br><br>
Anticancer Agents<br><br>
The compositions disclosed herein typically are administered in conjunction with an anticancer agent. In some embodiments, the anticancer agent is administered sequentially, either before or after the compositions disclosed herein, while in other embodiments, the anticancer agent is administered simultaneously, either separately or within the same composition as a Chkl inhibitor.<br><br>
"Anticancer agent" means any therapeutic agent that is capable of exhibiting efficacy at combating, ameliorating, or retarding a cancer, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, radiation, or both. In some embodiments, the anticancer agent is a Chkl activator.<br><br>
"Chkl activator" means any agent, whether now known or after-discovered, whether naturally occurring or man-made, having an ability to sufficiently activate Chkl kinase to induce a cell cycle arrest. An agent may be identified as a Chkl activator for purposes of this invention by methods known in the art. In one non-limiting method, the phosphorylation state of Chkl is measured as an indication of Chkl activation. For example, the phosphorylation of Chkl serines 317 and 345 has been shown to correlate with Chkl activation after treatment with agents known to activate Chkl. Chkl activators include those capable of arresting the cell cycle at a specific phase of the cell cycle, which phase may be referred to herein as the "target phase" for that activator. Target phases include any of the cell cycle phases except mitosis. Thus, in some embodiments, the Chkl activator will induce cell cycle arrest at the Gl phase. In other embodiments, the Chkl activator will induce cell cycle arrest at the S phase. In still other embodiments, the Chkl activator will induce cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase.<br><br>
The proportion of cells in different phases of the cell cycle can be measured by those skilled in the art using any one of a variety of techniques. For example, a fluorescent DNA-binding dye, propidium iodide, can be used to distinguish cells in different cell cycle phases. Since cells in G2 have twice as much DNA as cells in Gl, and S phase cells show an <br><br>
intermediate amount of DNA, the technique allows one to identify cells in different phases based on the DNA content of a cell. This method can be carried out on cell lines and tumor specimens (Cerra et al., Methods in Cell Biology, 33:1 (1990)) Furthermore, cells in S phase can be labeled with the nucleotide analog, bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), then fixed and stained with a fluorescent-tagged antibody to BrdU. Both of these methods employ fluorescence cytometry or fluorescence activity cell sorting (FACS) to quantify the proportion of cells staining with these fluorescent markers.<br><br>
An additional method for identification of cells in different phases of the cell cycle includes staining the cells with antibodies to markers that are either specific or selective for cell cycle phases. An antibody to the phosphorylated serine 10 residue of histone H3 is highly selective for mitotic cells. An antibody to phosphorylated serine 795 of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, is selective for S phase cells (Connell-Crowley et al., MoI. Biol. Cell, 8:287 (1997)). Staining of cells with these antibodies can be used to quantify the proportion of cells in these cell cycle phases by immunohistochemistry or western blot analysis.<br><br>
Another method for identification of cells in different phases of the cell cycle includes radioisotope labeling. For example, the ability of gemcitabine to arrest tumor cells in S phase may be assessed in multiple tumor types. Gandhi et al, J. Clin. Oncol., 20:665 (2002) discloses a method for assessing S phase arrest in acute myelogenous leukemia patients after treatment with gemcitabine. Patients received gemcitabine at a constant dose of 10/mg/m2/min for various durations of time and tumor cells isolated from blood of patients 24 hours after the start of therapy to determine the number of cells in S phase arrest. Cells may be plated in triplicate (2 x 106) in RPMI- 1640/ 10% Fetal bovine serum and 1 µCi of [3H]thymidine. Cells may then be allowed to incubate for 30 minutes, after which time thymidine incorporation may be measured. A decrease in radioisotope uptake after treatment with Chkl activator indicates whether the cells are arrested in S phase, and the duration of the S phase arrest.<br><br>
Any chemotherapeutic agent, known or after-discovered, can be used in the methods of the present invention. Any radiotherapeutic agent, known or after-discovered, also can be used in the methods of the present invention. The selection of a suitable anticancer agent is within the level of skill of the ordinarily skilled artisan. Factors used in the selection will depend, for example, upon the condition being treated, the cell type of aberrantly proliferating cells targeted, whether such cells are to be exposed to the anticancer agent in vivo or ex vivo, the recipient's health, and other factors which are known to those of <br><br>
ordinary skill in the art. Available anticancer agents can be adapted for use in the control of any aberrantly proliferating cell type or the conditions listed herein. For example, when the method is used to treat non-cancerous aberrantly proliferating cells, lower levels typically will be used than when treating cancerous aberrantly proliferating cells. For example, levels of radiation, e.g., ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and/or low levels of suitable chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate) may be used in the control of aberrantly proliferating cells according to the invention.<br><br>
"Inhibiting aberrant cell proliferation" means retarding the rate at which aberrantly proliferating cells proliferate or eliminating such proliferation altogether. This inhibition can result either from a decreased rate of replication, an increased rate of cell death, or both. Cell death can occur by any mechanism, including apoptosis and mitotic<br><br>
"Preventing aberrant cell proliferation" means inhibiting aberrant cell proliferation prior to occurrence, or inhibiting the recurrence thereof.<br><br>
"/« vivo" means within a living subject, as within an animal or human. In this context, agents can be used therapeutically in vivo to retard or eliminate the proliferation of aberrantly replicating cells. The agents also can be used in vivo as a prophylactic to prevent aberrant cell proliferation or the manifestation of symptoms associated therewith.<br><br>
"£x vivo" means outside a living subject. Examples of ex vivo cell populations include cell cultures and biological samples, such as fluid or tissue samples from humans or animals. Such samples can be obtained by methods well known in the art. Exemplary biological fluid samples include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. Exemplary tissue samples include tumors and biopsies thereof. In this context, the present formulations can be in numerous applications, both therapeutic and experimental.<br><br>
"Radiosensitizer" means a compound administered to a human or other animal in a therapeutically effective amount to increase the sensitivity of cells to electromagnetic radiation and/or to promote the treatment of diseases treatable with electromagnetic radiation.<br><br>
"Radiation" includes, but is not limited to, radiation having the wavelength of 10~20 to 100 meters.<br><br>

Formulations<br><br>
The compositions disclosed herein comprise a Chkl inhibitor and a cyclodextrin. In various embodiments, the compositions can further include an anticancer agent, such as a Chkl activator. Other additives also can be included in the compositions, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, pH-adjusting agents, such as buffers, as well as other additives. Such optional additional additives may include any single additive or <br><br>
combination of additives, as may be determined by a pharmacist, an attending physician, researcher, or others of ordinary skill in the relevant art for which the composition is used. Non-limiting examples of such additives include, alone or in combination or subcombination, such as one or more of an antiemetic, a cytoprotective agent, an antinecrotic, and/or an imaging agent.<br><br>
As used herein, "formulation" is interchangeable with the term "composition."<br><br>
In some embodiments, Chkl inhibitor formulations can be prepared in the following manner. A stock solution of the free base form of the Chkl inhibitor is prepared at the desired concentration in a solvent, such as water. To that solution, a second stock solution of the cyclodextrin in a solvent, such as water, is added. The resulting mixture can be sonicated to ensure complete mixing of the components. The pH of the mixture can be adjusted using known techniques, such as the addition of a buffer or other pH adjusting agent. This mixture then can be further manipulated, according to various embodiments disclosed herein, for example, adding an antiemetic agent, a cytoprotective agent, and/or the like. The mixture can additionally or alternatively be manipulated depending upon its desired route of administration and/or storage requirements. For example, the mixture can be dried (e.g., via lypohilization or spray drying), modified for injection, and the like.<br><br>
The pH of a formulation of various embodiments of the invention can vary widely to suit the intended purpose, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.

Slowly degenerating matrices also may be incorporated into the pharmaceutical formulations, e.g., alginates, polysaccharides. Another <br><br>
form of controlled release is a method based on the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.e., the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push the inhibitor compound out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects. Some enteric coatings also have a delayed release effect.<br><br>
Colorants and flavoring agents also may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions. For example, the Chkl inhibitors and cyclodextrins may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation), then further contained within an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.<br><br>

In such embodiments where the formulations are substantially free of water, the formulations are lyophilized, spray-dried, or subjected to other such comparable methods for drying a composition as known to those of skill in the relevant art. Compositions which are substantially free of water can be reconstituted with water or other aqueous solution(s) prior to administration.<br><br>
Dosage of Active Agents<br><br>
Active agents (e.g., anticancer agent and Chkl inhibitor) are employed in amounts effective to achieve their intended purpose. As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount effective to inhibit development of, or to alleviate the existing symptoms of, the condition of the subject being treated. "Dose-effective to inhibit" means an amount effective to inhibit or prevent the proliferation of a population of aberrantly proliferating cells, in vivo or ex vivo. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio of LD50 to ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices (i.e., a toxic dose that is substantially higher than the effective dose) are preferred.<br><br>
Inhibition of the checkpoint kinase can measured using a dose-response assay in which a sensitive assay system is contacted with a compound of interest over a range of concentrations, including concentrations at which no or minimal effect is observed, through higher concentrations at which partial effect is observed, to saturating concentrations at which a maximum effect is observed. Theoretically, such assays of the dose-response effect of inhibitor compounds can be described as a sigmoidal curve expressing a degree of inhibition as a function of concentration. The curve also theoretically passes through a point at which the concentration is sufficient to reduce activity of the checkpoint enzyme to a level that is 50% that of the difference between minimal and maximal enzyme activity in the assay. This concentration is defined as the Inhibitory Concentration (50%) or IC50 value. Determination of IC50 values preferably is made using conventional biochemical (acellular) assay techniques or cell-based assay techniques. <br><br>
Comparisons of the efficacy of inhibitors often are provided with reference to comparative IC50 values, wherein a higher IC50 indicates that the test compound is less potent, and a lower IC50 indicates that the compound is more potent, than a reference compound. Chkl inhibitor compounds demonstrating IC50 values of less than about 1000 nM, or less than about 250 nM, or less than about 100 nM, or less than about 50 nM, or less than about 20 nM, or less than about 1 nM, when measured using the dose-response assay, may be employed according to the invention.<br><br>
The data obtained in such dose-response assays can be used as a factor in formulating a dosage range for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form, and the route of administration utilized.<br><br>
The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active compound that are sufficient to maintain desired therapeutic effects. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment typically are in the range of 0.001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg per day, in a range of about 0.1 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg per dose of Chkl inhibitor. In some embodiments, Chkl doses range from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg, about 0.5 to about 40 mg/kg, about 0.7 to about 30 mg/kg, or about 1 to about 20 mg/kg. Specific doses contemplated include subranges of any of the foregoing ranges in 0.1 mg/kg increments.<br><br>
In various aspects of the invention, the disclosed formulations are administered in conjunction with an anticancer agent. In specific embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the anticancer agent can be influenced by the simultaneous and/or sequential administration of the Chkl inhibitor present in the composition. Therefore, in various embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the anticancer agent for administration in conjunction with a Chkl inhibitor is less than the therapeutically effective amount of the same anticancer agent in the absence of a Chkl inhibitor. Such a determination of the appropriate therapeutically effective dosage of anticancer agent and/or Chkl inhibitor is within the scope of knowledge of the treating physician, based upon an individual patient's specific disease, medical history, and other such factors. <br><br>
Scheduling of Administration<br><br>
In some embodiments, as indicated above, the at least one antiproliferative (e.g., anticancer) agent is administered before, after, or at the same time as a composition according to an embodiment of the invention. The frequency of dosing, duration of dosing, and dose of the antiproliferative agent and Chkl inhibitor present in various embodiments of the present invention may each be independently varied to accomplish their intended purposes, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the antiproliferative agent comprises a Chkl activator. In some embodiments, Chkl activator is contacted with a population of aberrantly proliferating cells in an amount and for a time and/or frequency sufficient to substantially synchronize cell cycle arrest at the target phase for the type of Chkl activator used, prior to contacting the population with Chkl inhibitor. Such methods are generally disclosed in WO 05/27907, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In such embodiments, the cell population may be contacted with Chkl inhibitor by administration of a formulation according to various embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the population of aberrantly proliferating cells will undergo optimal synchronization prior to contacting the population with Chkl inhibitor. For optimal synchronization, a maximum percentage of cells in the population to are allowed to "pile up" or arrest in the target phase for the activator used, with a minimum percentage having progressed into mitosis. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that lesser degrees of cell cycle synchronization prior to contact with the Chkl inhibitor will provide some benefit. Thus, "substantial synchronization" includes any degree of synchronization of cell cycle arrest, including optimal, that results in a cytotoxic effect greater than that seen without use of Chkl inhibitor, or greater than that seen with co-administration of Chkl activator and inhibitor, or greater than that seen when the cells are contacted with Chkl inhibitor prior to Chkl activator. The degree of cell cycle arrest corresponding to or exceeding these references qualifies as "substantial synchronization."<br><br>
Treatment with a disclosed composition may follow at least about a 10% increase in the number of aberrantly proliferating cells in the target phase of the Chkl activator used; optionally at least about 20%, at least about 50%, at least about 100%; at least about 150%; at least about 200%; at least about 250%; at least about 300%; at least about 350%; at least about 400% increase, at least about 450%, or at least about 500%, as compared to the number of aberrantly proliferating cells present in such phase in the absence of a Chkl <br><br>
activator. These ranges are merely exemplary, however, and are dependent upon cell type, the particular Chkl activator used, and other factors readily discernable to those skilled in the art. For example, the skilled artisan will appreciate that the maximum percent increase for any particular cell sample population of aberrantly proliferating cells will be limited by various factors, including percentage of cells present in the target phase of the population prior to Chkl activator contact.<br><br>
As indicated above, upon achieving substantial synchronization of cell cycle arrest in the cell population, the cell population can be contacted with a Chkl inhibitor using a formulation of the present invention in an amount and for a time sufficient to substantially abrogate the cell cycle arrest. The term "substantially abrogate" is used to indicate that complete abrogation of all arrested cells may not be necessary for efficacy. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a sufficient degree of cell cycle checkpoint abrogation may be achieved to disrupt cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms and allow cells to pass to a subsequent phase in the cell cycle with unrepaired DNA damage sufficient to cause cell death or otherwise slow or stop aberrant cell proliferation.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate how to convert information concerning cell cycle synchronization and abrogation to practical use in the clinic or laboratory. For example, for any given cell line, Chkl activator, and Chkl inhibitor, the dose, frequency of dose, and period over which to administer each dose to achieve substantial cell cycle synchronization and substantial abrogation, respectively, may be measured ex vivo. Ex vivo measurements then may be applied to the clinic as a practical surrogate for direct measurement of the percentage of cells in various phases of the cell cycle.<br><br>
In determining such measurements, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the frequency and duration of Chkl activator contact with the cell population may, as indicated above, be influenced by the cell type exhibiting unwanted cell proliferation. Like most cells, aberrantly proliferating cells do not cycle at a universal rate. Some types proliferate faster than others, i.e., have a faster doubling time. Thus, for example, treatment of a tumor cell type with a fast doubling time (e.g., pancreatic cancer or melanoma) may require shorter treatment with Chkl activator to substantially synchronize cell cycle arrest, while treatment of a tumor with a slower doubling time (e.g., some colon, breast or prostate tumors) would require longer contact with Chkl activator, all other things being equal, to induce substantially synchronous cell cycle arrest. <br><br>
Times effective to allow substantial cell cycle synchronization by the Chkl activator may vary from a few minutes up to 96 hours or more. In some embodiments, it may be preferable or desirable to administer a Chkl activator for up to several weeks or more, as determined by the attending physician or technician. Thus, a Chkl activator can contact the cell population for up to about 30 minutes, up to about 1 hour, up to about 2 hours, up to about 3 hours, up to about 4 hours, up to about 6 hours, up to about 12 hours, up to about 18 hours, up to about 24 hours, up to about 48 hours, up to about 72 hours or up to about 96 hours or more. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ranges of time expressed herein are merely exemplary; ranges and sub-ranges within those expressed may be used.<br><br>
Contact of the cell population with the Chkl activator may occur in single doses or over a plurality of doses, according to methods well known in the art for the particular Chkl activator or activators used. For example, the Chkl activator may be given at a frequency of: 4 doses delivered as one dose per day at 4-day intervals (q4d x 4); 4 doses delivered as one dose per day at 3-day intervals (q3d x 4); 1 dose delivered per day at 5-day intervals (qd x 5); one dose per week for 3 weeks (qwk3); 5 daily doses, with two days rest, and another 5 daily doses (5/2/5); or, any dose regimen determined to be appropriate for circumstance. Some time may optionally be allowed to lapse between the last dose of Chkl activator to achieve substantial synchronization of cell cycle arrest prior to contact with the first dose of Chkl inhibitor as necessary. Similar regimens may be used when Chkl activator is chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic. Additional radiotherapeutic doses are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
Contact of the cell population with a composition of the present invention may likewise occur at any dose and time sufficient to achieve substantial abrogation of the cell cycle checkpoint. Typically, though not necessarily, such times include up to about 72 to about 96 hours, depending upon various factors such as those discussed above. In some embodiments, it may be desirable or necessary to administer a present composition over a period of up to about several weeks or more, as determined by the attending physician or technician. Thus, the composition typically can be administered for up to about 1 hour, up to about 2 hours, up to about 3 hours, up to about 4 hours, up to about 6 hours, up to about 12 hours, up to about 18 hours, up to about 24 hours, up to about 48 hours, or up to about 72 hours. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ranges of time expressed herein are merely exemplary; ranges and sub-ranges within those expressed may be used<br><br>
A present composition can be administered over a plurality of doses. For example, a present composition can be given at a frequency of: 4 doses delivered as one dose <br><br>
per day at 4-day intervals (q4d x 4); 4 doses delivered as one dose per day at 3 -day intervals (q3d x 4); 1 dose delivered per day at 5-day intervals (qd x 5); one dose per week for 3 weeks (qwk3); 5 daily doses, with two days rest, and another 5 daily doses (5/2/5); or, any dose regimen pre-determined to be appropriate for the circumstance.<br><br>
Routes of Administration<br><br>
In various aspects, the compositions disclosed herein can be administered dermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intra-articularly, pulmonally, buccally, sublingually, nasally, via inhalation, percutaneously, vaginally, orally, parenterally, rectally, intravenously, topically, intradermally, ophthalmically, and/or intraperitonealy. The route of administration can be chosen by the treating physician, based upon the patient's condition and disease to be treated.<br><br>
Parenteral administration includes, but is not limited to intravenous, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and intra-articular. Parenteral administration also can be accomplished using a high-pressure technique, like POWDERJECT™.<br><br>
For oral or buccal administration, the composition can be in the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For example, tablets and capsules for oral administration can contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch, or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example, lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, or sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycolate), or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets can be coated according to methods well known in the art.<br><br>
Alternatively, a composition of the present invention can be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Moreover, the compositions can be a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can contain conventional additives, for example suspending agents, such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel, and hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; nonaqueous vehicles (which can include edible oils), such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene <br><br>
glycol, and ethyl alcohol; and preservatives, such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate and sorbic acid.<br><br>
The compositions also can be formulated into suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Compositions for inhalation typically can be provided in the form of a solution, suspension, or emulsion that can be administered as a dry powder or in the form of an aerosol using a conventional propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane or trichlorofluoromethane. Typical topical and transdermal formulations comprise conventional aqueous or nonaqueous vehicles, such as eye drops, creams, ointments, lotions, and pastes, or are in the form of a medicated plaster, patch, or membrane.<br><br>
Additionally, compositions of the present invention can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be in the form of suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulation agents, such as suspending, stabilizing, and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the compositions can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile, pyrogen- free water) before use.<br><br>
A composition in accordance with the present invention also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Accordingly, the compositions of the invention can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., an emulsion in an acceptable oil), ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., a sparingly soluble salt).<br><br>
Cancers and Other Diseases<br><br>
Use of the disclosed compositions is indicated in a treatment of any condition involving aberrant cell proliferation, including cancerous and non-cancerous cell proliferation. In one aspect, treatment may be of any condition responsive to agents that activate cell cycle arrest or are responsive to inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoint proteins.<br><br>
Cancers include tumors or neoplasms derived from growths of tissue cells wherein multiplication of cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such neoplasms are benign, but others are termed "malignant," and can lead to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms are distinguished from benign growths in that, in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, the malignant neoplasms can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized by showing a greater loss of <br><br>
differentiation (greater "dedifferentiation") and organization relative to one another and surrounding tissues. This property is called "anaplasia."<br><br>
Cancers treatable by the present invention include solid tumors such as carcinomas and sarcomas. Carcinomas derive from epithelial cells which infiltrate (i.e., invade) surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue, or from tissues that form recognizable glandular structures. Sarcomas are tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance, like embryonic connective tissue. The invention also enables treatment of cancers of the myeloid or lymphoid systems, including leukemias, lymphomas, and other cancers that typically are not present as a tumor mass, but are distributed in the vascular or lymphoreticular systems.<br><br>
Further cancers include, but are not limited to, myxoid and round cell carcinomas, human soft tissue sarcomas including Ewing's sarcoma, cancer metastases including lymphatic metastases, squamous cell carcinomas particularly of the head and neck, esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, oral carcinomas, blood cell malignancies, including multiple myelomas, leukemias, including acute lymphocytic leukemias, acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemias, chronic myelocytic leukemias, and hairy cell leukemias, effusion lymphomas (body cavity based lymphomas), thymic lymphoma lung cancers (including small cell carcinomas of the lungs, cutaneous T cell lymphomas, Hodgkin's lymphomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, cancers of the adrenal cortex, ACTH-producing tumors, non-small cell lung cancers, breast cancers, including small cell carcinomas and ductal carcinomas), gastro-intestinal cancers (including stomach cancers, colon cancers, colorectal cancers, and polyps associated with colorectal neoplasias), pancreatic cancers, liver cancers, urological cancers (including bladder cancers, such as primary superficial bladder tumors, invasive transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, and muscle-invasive bladder cancers), prostate cancers, malignancies of the female genital tract (including ovarian carcinomas, primary peritoneal epithelial neoplasms, cervical carcinomas, uterine endometrial cancers, vaginal cancers, cancers of the vulva, uterine cancers and solid tumors in the ovarian follicle), malignancies of the male genital tract (including testicular cancers and penile cancers), kidney cancers (including renal cell carcinomas), brain cancers (including intrinsic brain tumors, neuroblastomas, astrocytomas, gliomas, and metastatic tumor cell invasions in the central nervous system), bone cancers (including osteomas and osteosarcomas), skin cancers (including malignant melanomas, tumor progressions of human skin keratinocytes, basal cell carcinomas, and squamous cell cancers), thyroid cancers, retinoblastomas, peritoneal effusions, malignant pleural effusions, mesotheliomas, Wilms's <br><br>
tumors, gall bladder cancers, trophoblastic neoplasms, hemangiopericytomas, and Kaposi's sarcomas.<br><br>

Non-cancerous conditions treatable by the present compositions can also include a variety of inflammation and inflammatory diseases, conditions, or disorders. Examples of such indications include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, vitiligo, Wegener's granulomatosis, and SLE. Treatment of arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and SLE often involves the use of immunosuppressive therapies, such as ionizing radiation, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Psoriasis and vitiligo commonly are treated with ultraviolet radiation (UV) in combination with a psoralen. Such treatments typically induce, either directly or indirectly, DNA damage. Inhibition of Chkl activity within the offending immune cells renders the cells more sensitive to control by these standard treatments. In general, Chkl inhibitors useful in the invention may optionally be used to potentiate control of inflammatory disease cells when administered alone or in combination with immunosuppressive drugs.<br><br>

A kit can comprise a dosage form of a disclosed composition in a first container and a package insert containing instructions for use of the composition in treatment of a medical condition. Conditions indicated on the label can include treatment of disorders involving aberrantly proliferating cells, such as cancers and non-cancerous disorders like psoriasis, renal disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In some embodiments, the kits further comprise a therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of aberrantly proliferating cells. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent comprises an anticancer agent.

The package insert contains instructions on the use of the packaged composition or compositions in the treatment of a medical condition, like a cancer.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention, but are not intended to limit the scope thereof. In vitro hemolysis studies describe the decreased toxicity of compositions comprising at least one Chkl inhibitor and at least one cyclodextrin compared to Chkl inhibitor compositions in the absence of a cyclodextrin. Solubility studies demonstrate the increased amounts of Chkl inhibitor solubilized in compositions comprising a cyclodextrin compared to compositions free of a cyclodextrin. For the studies described below, two different disubstituted urea Chkl inhibitor compounds of formula (X) were used, which will be referred to as "Chkl inhibitor A" and "Chkl inhibitor B," respectively.<br><br>
In Vitro Hemolysis Studies<br><br>
The hemolytic potential of Chkl inhibitor A of formula (X) was determined in various formulation excipients when spiked into rat and human blood. These in vitro experiments were based upon a modified method reported by Krzyzaniak et al., J Pharm. Sciences, 86: 1215 (1997). Fresh whole blood from normal human donors or Sprague-Dawley <br><br>
rats was collected into sodium heparin and an aliquot was centrifuged to verify a hemolysis- free sample. Negative controls consisted of normal saline (0.9 %) or excipient only. A red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (10 mM KHCO3, 150 mM NH4Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) was used as a positive control. Aliquots of 0.02 mL of control or formulated test sample were mixed with 0.98 mL of blood to achieve varying final concentrations of the Chkl inhibitor compound (10 - 1000 µg/mL). Alternatively, other blood/test article volume ratios also were tested using 0.1 mL of test sample with 0.9 mL of whole blood. Samples were incubated at 25°C for 3 minutes and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The plasma supernatant was collected for a qualitative determination of hemolysis, based on visual analysis using a rated score as follows: 0-no hemolysis; 1-trace hemolysis; 2-slight to moderate hemolysis; 3- marked hemolysis; 4-gross hemolysis. For some samples, quantitative analysis was performed by measuring absorption of hemoglobin in the plasma supernatant at 540 nm by UV spectrometry to calculate percent hemolysis. Osmolality readings also were measured on the test samples from the assays. The osmolality measurements of all test solutions in these experiments were interpreted as within a normal range. Therefore, an osmolality-induced imbalance of the formulated solutions did not contribute to the experimental results. Results for the assay in various formulations are reported in Table II, below. As seen in Table II, the formulation containing Captisol and free base of Chkl inhibitor A was able to better protect the erythrocytes from hemolysis at concentrations of 100 µg/mL than the corresponding composition having the monomesylate salt of the Chkl inhibitor.<br><br>
For the in vitro hemolysis studies, two Chkl inhibitor formulations were prepared for analyses. The first was a stock formulation of the free base form of Chkl inhibitor A, which was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/mL in 16.67% (w/v) Captisol in sterile water. To prepare the stock formulation, the appropriate amount of the free base form of Chkl inhibitor A was weighed and placed in an appropriate sized container. The formulation was brought up to 90% of the desired volume with a 16.67% (w/v) Captisol in sterile water solution. The solution then was sonicated to break up any aggregates of the Chkl inhibitor. While stirring the solution, a calibrated pH meter was used to measure the pH. The pH was gradually adjusted to 4.5 ± 0.1 with HCl (hydrochloric acid). Finally, the formulation was brought up to final volume with the 16.67% (w/v) Captisol in sterile water solution to achieve the 50 mg/mL target concentration of Chkl inhibitor A. To prepare all other Chkl inhibitor A solutions, the 50 mg/mL stock solution was diluted to the desired final concentration with 5% Dextrose Injection USP (D5W). This procedure was implemented to maintain a constant ratio of test compound to Captisol throughout all of the formulations. A <br><br>
second formulation was prepared with the monomesylate salt of Chkl inhibitor A in 5% dextrose. For this formulation, the appropriate amount of the monomesylate salt of Chkl inhibitor A (adjusted for increased formula weight (FW) due to the addition of the mesylate ion) was weighed and placed in an appropriate sized container. The formulation was brought up to the desired final volume with 5% D5W to yield a 50 mg/mL Chkl inhibitor A monomesylate salt stock solution. The solution then was sonicated to break up any Chkl inhibitor aggregates. While stirring the solution, a calibrated pH meter was used to measure the pH. The pH was within the desired range of 4.5 ± 0.1 and therefore did not require adjustment. To prepare all of the other Chkl inhibitor A monomesylate salt solutions, the 50 mg/mL stock solution was diluted to the desired final concentration with 5% D5W.<br><br>

In Vivo Hemolysis Studies<br><br>
In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats for both the Chkl inhibitor A and Chkl inhibitor B of formula (X). A single 5 mg/kg intravenous bolus dose was administered at 1 mL/kg to at least three rats. Both Chkl inhibitors A and B were administered in the following formulations: (1) 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% dextrose; (2) 30-50% polyethylene glycol 400; or (3) 10% Captisol. The rats then were observed for adverse side effects. The results are summarized in Table III, below. Adverse reactions were defined as labored breathing immediately post dosing, hemolyzed <br><br>
plasma samples, and bloody-colored urine immediately post dosing, mildly persisting for up to one hour post dosing.<br><br>
The formulations for the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were prepared as follows.<br><br>
(1) For the Chkl inhibitor A monomesylate salt in 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% dextrose, the appropriate amount of monomesylate salt form (adjusted for FW) was weighed and placed in an appropriate sized container. The appropriate volume of 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% dextrose was added to the formulation to achieve the final target concentration. The solution then was sonicated to break up any Chkl inhibitor aggregates. While stirring the solution, a calibrated pH meter was used to measure the pH. The pH was within the desired range of 4.2 ± 0.3 and therefore did not require adjustment.<br><br>
For the Chkl inhibitor B free base in 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% dextrose, the appropriate amount of Chkl inhibitor free base was weighed out and placed in an appropriate sized container. An in-situ salt of the compound was made by the addition of 1.1 molar equivalent of hydrochloric acid to the compound. The compound and acid were vortexed in order to uniformly "wet" the compound. The formulation was brought up to 90% of the desired volume with 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% dextrose. The solution then was sonicated to break up any Chkl inhibitor aggregates. While stirring the solution, a calibrated pH meter was used to measure the pH. The pH was gradually adjusted to 4.2 ± 0.3 with NaOH (sodium hydroxide). Finally, the formulation was brought up to final volume with 2.5 mM sodium acetate and 5% Dextrose.<br><br>
(2) For the Chkl inhibitor A in 50% polyethylene glycol 400 and the Chkl inhibitor B in 30% polyethylene glycol 400, the appropriate amount of Chkl inhibitor free base was weighed and placed in an appropriate sized container. The appropriate volume of 50% polyethylene glycol 400 in water for injection or 30% polyethylene glycol 400 in water for injection, respectively, was added to the formulation to achieve the final target concentration. The formulations were sonicated for 5 minutes, then placed on a wrist action shaker overnight to facilitate complete dissolution of the test article.<br><br>
(3) For the Chkl inhibitor A in 10% Captisol and the Chkl inhibitor B in 10% Captisol, the appropriate amount of the Chkl inhibitor free base was weighed and placed in an appropriate sized container, respectively. Each formulation was brought up to 90% of the desired volume with a 10% (w/v) Captisol in sterile water solution. The solutions were then sonicated to break up any Chkl inhibitor aggregates. While stirring the solutions, a <br><br>
calibrated pH meter was used to measure the pH. The pH was gradually adjusted to 4.2 ± 0.3 with HCl. Finally, the formulation was brought up to final volume with the 10% (w/v) Captisol in sterile water solution to yield the desired target concentration of each Chkl inhibitor.<br><br>
Table III<br><br><br>
Solubility Studies<br><br>
The equilibrium solubility of Chkl inhibitor A as its free base is low (2.6 mg/mL of water, pH 6, 25°C). The following studies were made in order to increase solubility via addition of cosolvents and surfactants, adjustment of the pH, and complexation with cyclodextrins. The solvents selected are relevant for clinical dosing via an intravenous route.<br><br>
Solubility was determined by placing an excess of Chkl inhibitor A in a vial with the solvent/co-solvent. The vial was agitated at constant temperature for approximately 24 hours. The drug suspensions were then filtered or centrifuged. Appropriate volumes of the sample solutions were analyzed by HPLC. Table IV, below, shows the solubilities of various solvent/co-solvent combinations of Chkl inhibitor A at 25°C, and Table V shows the solubilities in the presence of cyclodextrin. <br><br>
Table IV<br><br><br>
Table V<br><br><br>
Improvements in the solubility of Chkl inhibitor A were achieved by the addition of clinically relevant solvents for dosing via an intravenous route. Ionization of the compound through adjustment of pH also improved the solubility of Chkl inhibitor A. Tenfold increases in solubility were achieved by the addition of cyclodextrins to the solution. Solubilization with cyclodextrins was enhanced by lowering pH. <br><br>
Stability Studies<br><br>
Two solution formulations of Chkl inhibitor A were manufactured and tested for stability. One formulation contained Chkl inhibitor A as its free base in 16.66% Captisol pH 4.5 (Table VI). The other formulation contained the mesylate salt of Chkl inhibitor A in 5% dextrose, pH 4.5 (Table VII). Both formulations contained 50 mg/mL of the Chkl inhibitor. The formulations were packaged in 20 mL borosilicate glass vials with a 20 mm FLUROTEC® stopper, aluminum seal and flip-off lid.<br><br>
Each formulation was stored at 25°C/60% relative humidity (RH) and 40°C/75%RH and assessed for stability of appearance, chiral purity, assay and related substances, osmolality, pH, and particulates. The total related substances from high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) data for vials stored upright in the stability study with and without Captisol are given in Tables VIII and IX, respectively.<br><br>
Solutions of Chkl inhibitor A in Captisol had improved chemical stability compared to solutions of the mesylate salt of Chkl inhibitor A in the absence of Captisol when stored at 40°C/75% RH. Degradation of Chkl inhibitor A was found to be accelerated by moisture and heat. After storage at 40°C/75% RH, the Captisol containing formulation contained 3.06 and 4.96% of related impurities after 1 and 2 months, respectively, while the non- Captisol containing formulation contained 4.41 and 7.10% at the respective timepoints.<br><br>
