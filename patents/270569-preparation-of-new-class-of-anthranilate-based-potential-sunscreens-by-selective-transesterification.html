FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention concerns Synthesis of new class of anthranilates by selective transesterification of the Methyl-(2-amino and /2-methylamino) benzoate with 2,<br><br>
4-dihydroxy-2-methylpentane and the determination of photestability and sun protection factor of the said compounds<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Prior Art<br>
The anthranilate derivatives such as Methyl anthranilate and p-amino benzoic acid derivative like Padimate 0 are currently available sunscreens. They are mainly UVB absorbers. Padimate 0 is the most potent UV-B absorber. The decline in its use, along with the demand for higher SPF products has led to the incorporation of multiple active ingredients into a single product to achieve the desired SPF, replacing sunscreens with single PABA esters1. Several commercially available class of compounds either have absorbance in the UVA region (320-400nm) or UVB region (290-320nm).Due to unavailability of any single anthranilate derivative as sunscreen with UVA and UVB absorbance, sunscreen lotion contains mixtures of two different compounds. This not only increases the cost of sunscreen lotion but also increase the potential risk in mixing the two different sunscreens. The combination of commercial octylmethoxycinamate and butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane (Parsol 1789; also known as avobenzone) is not recommended2 because of its photo instability, photo adducts are formed between OMC and photo generated fragments3.<br>
Thus there is a need of sunscreen compounds that can cover both UVA and UVB range.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to synthesis of new class of chemical compounds, which are 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl 2-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl 2-(methylamino)benzoate, which can be potential UV sunscreens, Their method of preparation and in vitro testing as UV sunscreen agents by the way of determining Sun protection factor (SPF) is reported in the present invention.<br><br>
Anthranillates are generally synthesized by means of esterification of anthranilic acid with alcohol or by transesterification of ester of anthranilic acid and alcohol using either acid or base as a catalyst4 .Later route was adopted for the preparation of Novel anthranilates. No references been reported in published literature for proposed UV sunscreen agents and their method of preparation.<br>
Pertaining to the high ultraviolet absorbance entirely in UVA and UVB region (see Fig.2. &amp; Fig3), proposed invented compound can be used as UV Sunscreen agent. The compounds also exhibit good photostability. The said compounds are in liquid form and have wide UV range of about 300-380nm than the previously reported anthranillates such as methyl anthranilate. The free hydroxyl group in the invented moiety is helpful to enhance the bathochromic shift in the UV A region, thus making these compounds more effective in treating the sunburns. Invented compounds can offer good solubility in polar solvents such as alcohols, and ketones.<br>
Objects of Invention<br>
 The one object of the invention comprises the use of synthetic strategy such<br>
as transesterification for the synthesis of the novel anthranilates mentioned as compounds in example 1 and example2<br>
 Another object of invention relates to the use of metal doped catalysts for the synthesis of such novel anthranilates.<br>
 Yet another object of invention is the use of said compounds as UV sunscreen agents, either individually or in combination.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, relates to new class of sun screen agents based on anthranilate derivatives such as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl 2-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl 2-(methylamino)benzoate (Scheme 1) their method of preparation, their photo stability study and sun protection factor (SPF) determination.<br>
The process for the preparation of said anthranilate derivatives comprises a<br><br>
selective transesterification reaction i.e. reacting an excess moles of 2,4-dihydroxy-2-methylpentane with Methyl 2-amino benzoate (Example 1) and Methyl 2-(methyl amino)benzoate (Example 2) using catalyst like calcium oxide and sodium doped calcium oxide. Reaction illustrated in Fig. 1.<br><br>
Figurel. Preparation of anthranilate derivative. <br>
The catalysts required for the present invention were prepared as follows:<br>
Preparation of alkali metal doped catalysts:<br>
The calcium hydroxide about 90% pure from Qualigens with particle size l50 mÎ¼ <br>
was used for the preparation of catalyst.<br>
The alkali metal Na or K doped CaO was prepared by wet impregnation of the corresponding carbonates on calcium hydroxide with a theoretical metal content varied to get 1.25% and 2.5% metal loading on calcium oxide. The catalyst is prepared by following process.<br>
35g of calcium hydroxide (90%) was impregnated with 1.46g of Sodium carbonate. The aqueous suspension was heated under stirring for 2hrs, then evaporated to dryness and the resulting powder was subsequently calcined at 750Â°C for 6hrs. The theoretical metal content was about 2.5% sodium on CaO<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
   It is well known that ultraviolet radiation (light) having a wavelength from about 280nm or 290nm to about 320nm (UV-B) is harmful to human skin, causing burns that are detrimental to the development of good sun tan. The UV-A radiation (about 320nm to about 400nm), produces tanning of skin, also it can cause damage, particularly to very light colored or sensitive skin, leading to reduction of skin elasticity and wrinkles. Therefore sunscreen compounds for use on human skin preferably include both a UV-A &amp; UV-B filter to prevent most of the sunlight within the full range of about 280nm to 400nm from damaging the human skin.<br>
 The New compounds in the class of anthranilates have broad absorbance in the UVA and UVB region.<br>
 Transesterification is very selective towards the hydroxyl group attached to the secondary carbon atom; therefore the free hydroxyl group attached to the tertiary carbon is protected by the selective transesterification strategy. This is confirmed on the basis of spectral data of compounds. Forward path of the reaction is achieved by continuous removal of liberated methanol using dean and stark collector.<br>
Anthranilate derivatives are prepared by transesterification reaction catalyzed by alkali metal doped Calcium oxide, following examples are sited to illustrate theme of the invention. (A) EXAMPLE 1 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl 2-aminobenzoate<br>

The resulting mixture was heated at 185-190 Â°C. During reaction liberated methanol is collected in dean and stark. After completion of reaction, reaction mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst, and<br><br>
