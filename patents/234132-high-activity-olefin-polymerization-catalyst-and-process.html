HIGH ACTIVITY OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND PROCESS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE STATEMENT<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 10/429,024, filed May 2, 2003. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Group 4 metal complex, to a catalyst composition and to a process for polymerizing addition polymerizable unsaturated monomers, especially olefins. In particular, the invention is directed to certain Group 4 metal complexes, to catalyst compositions comprising the same, and to addition polymerization processes using the same.<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Recently, several new disclosures related to metal complexes based on donor ligands have published. Among these are U. S. Patent 6,103,657, US2002 0142912, WO 2000 020377 and WO 2002 038628. Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges associated with process operability, still exist. For example, the tendency for known Group 4 metal complexes to lose catalyst operating efficiency at high polymerization temperatures in solution polymerization processes remains a challenge. Additionally, improved solubility of the metal complex in common aliphatic solvents is desired.<br>
In particular, in a continuous solution polymerization process, operation at high polymerization temperatures, especially temperatures greater than 100 °C, more preferably greater than 110 °C, are desired in order to increase the operating efficiency of the process. In addition, by operating at elevated polymerization temperatures, olefin polymers having unique physical properties, composition, and structure may be prepared.<br>
Thus, it would be advantageous to have a polymerization process capable of operating continuously with enhanced reactor efficiency and at the same time produce new and improved polymers. It would also be highly beneficial to have a continuously operating solution polymerization process having more stable catalyst productivity, improved efficiency, and increased duration of operation.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a Group 4 metal complex for use as a catalyst component of an addition polymerization catalyst composition, said metal complex corresponding to the formula:<br>
wherein <br>
G1 is selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaralkyl, heteroalkaryl, silyl, and inertly substituted derivatives thereof containing from 1 to 40 atoms not counting hydrogen, preferably a di-ortho-alkyl- substituted aryl, most preferably 2,6-diisopropylphenyl;<br>
T is a divalent bridging group of from 10 to 30 atoms not counting hydrogen, selected from mono- or di- aryl- substituted methylene or silylene groups or mono- or di- heteroaryl-substituted methylene or silylene groups, wherein at least one such aryl- or heteroaryl-substituent is substituted in one or both ortho- positions with a secondary or tertiary alkyl-group, a secondary or tertiary heteroalkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, or a heterocycloalkyl group,<br>
G2 is a C6.20 heteroaryl group containing Lewis base functionality, especially a pyridin-2-yl- or substituted pyridin-2-yl group,<br>
M is the Group 4 metal, preferably hafnium,<br>
X"" is an anionic, neutral or dianionic ligand group,<br>
x"" is a number from 0 to 5 indicating the number of X"" groups, and<br>
bonds, optional bonds and electron donative interactions are represented by lines, dotted lines and arrows respectively.<br>
Additionally, according to the present invention there is provided a catalyst composition comprising the foregoing Group 4 metal complex. Additional components of such catalyst composition may include an activator capable of converting said metal complex into an active catalyst for addition polymerization, a carrier or support, a liquid solvent or diluent, a tertiary component such as a scavenger, and/or one or more additives or adjuvants such as processing aids, sequestrants, and/or chain transfer agents.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides an addition polymerizing process, especially an olefin polymerization process, wherein one or more addition polymerizable monomers are polymerized in the presence of the foregoing catalyst composition to form a high molecular weight polymer. Preferred polymerization processes are solution<br>
2<br><br>
polymerizations, most preferably solution processes wherein ethylene, propylene, mixtures of ethylene and propylene, and mixtures of ethylene and/or propylene with one or more C4 or higher olefins or diolefins are polymerized or copolymerized.<br>
The metal complexes and catalysts of the invention may be used alone or combined with other metal complexes or catalyst compositions and the polymerization process may be used in a series or parallel process with one or more other polymerization processes. The invention also provides for a method of making a catalyst composition useful for the polymerization of olefin(s), comprising combining, contacting, blending and/or mixing the foregoing catalyst components, and, optionally, recovering the composition or removing diluent, if present, and recovering the resulting solid composition. Suitable additional polymerization catalyst compositions for use in combination with the metal complexes of the present invention include conventional Ziegler-Natta-type transition metal polymerization catalysts as well as 7t-bonded transition metal compounds such as metallocene-type catalysts, or other transition metal complexes. The catalysts of the invention are preferred for use as olefin polymerization catalysts compared to similar compounds lacking a secondary or tertiary branching center in T because they are capable of achieving higher catalyst efficiencies at a given monomer conversion or, alternatively, they are capable of achieving higher monomer conversion at a given catalyst efficiency.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All reference to the Periodic Table of the Elements herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 2001. Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the IUPAC system for numbering groups.<br>
The term "comprising" and derivatives thereof is not intended to exclude the presence of any additional component, step or procedure, whether or not the same is disclosed herein. In order to avoid any doubt, all compositions claimed herein through use of the term "comprising" may include any additional additive, adjuvant, or compound whether polymeric or otherwise, unless stated to the contrary. In contrast, the term, "consisting essentially of excludes from the scope of any succeeding recitation any other component, step or procedure, excepting those that are not essential to operability. The term "consisting of excludes any component, step or procedure not specifically delineated or listed. The term "or", unless stated otherwise, refers to the listed members individually as well as in any combination.<br>
The term "hetero" or "hetero-atom" refers to a non-carbon atom, especially Si, B, N, P or O. "Heteroaryl", "heteroalkyl", "heterocycloalkyl" and "heteroaralkyl" refer to aryl,<br>
1<br><br>
alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aralkyl groups respectively, in which at least one carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom. "Inertly substituted" refers to substituents on a ligand that do not destroy operability of the invention. Preferred inert substituents are halo, di(Ci.6 hydrocarbyl)amino, C2-6 hydrocarbyleneamino, Ci.6 halohydrocarbyl, and tri(C!.6 hydrocarbyl)silyl. The term "polymer", as used herein, includes both homopolymers, that is, polymers prepared from a single reactive compound, and copolymers, that is, polymers prepared by reaction of at least two polymer forming reactive, monomelic compounds. The term "crystalline" refers to a polymer that exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern at 25 °C and possesses a first order transition or crystalline melting point (Tm) from the differential scanning calorimetry heating curve. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline".<br>
The invention is directed toward novel metal complexes and catalyst compositions comprising the same. The invention also relates to a polymerization process having improved operability and product capabilities using the present metal complexes in the catalyst composition. It has been surprisingly discovered that using the present catalyst composition results in a substantially improved polymerization process. In particular, utilizing the present catalyst composition results in a substantial improvement in process operability, an ability to significantly increase the polymerization temperature, especially of a solution polymerization, improved catalyst performance, better polymer properties, and the capability to produce a broader range of polymers in a given reactor configuration.<br>
Preferred metal complexes according to the present invention are those resulting from hydrogen elimination from the amine group, and optionally from the loss of one or more additional groups, especially from G2, in polyfunctional Lewis base compounds of the following formula I: <br>
wherein G1, T and G2 are as previously defined for formula IA, upon reaction thereof with a Group 4 metal compound. Electron donation from the Lewis basic, heteroaryl functionality, G2, preferably an electron pair, provides additional stability to the metal center of the metal complexes of formula IA. The metal complex is generated by combining the Group 4 metal compound and Lewis base compound in an inert reaction medium.<br>
Preferred examples of the foregoing polyfunctional Lewis base compounds and the resulting metal complexes correspond to the formulas:<br><br><br>
group, or a substituted alkyl-, aryl-, aralkyl-, cycloalkyl-, or silyl- group of up to 20 atoms not counting hydrogen, or adjacent G3, G4, G5 or G6 groups may be joined together thereby forming fused-ring derivatives, and<br>
bonds, optional bonds and electron pair donative interactions are represented by lines, dotted lines and arrows respectively.<br>
More preferred examples of the foregoing difunctional Lewis base compounds and metal complexes correspond to the formula:<br><br>
naphthalenyl;<br>
Ga independently each occurrence is hydrogen, Ci.2o alkyl, or halo, more preferably at least 2 of said Ga groups are Q.20 alkyl groups bonded through a secondary or tertiary carbon atom and located in the two ortho- positions of the phenyl ring, most preferably both such Ga groups are isopropyl groups located in the two ortho-positions of the phenyl ring;<br>
G7 and Gs independently each occurrence are hydrogen or a Ci_30 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, or heteroaralkyl group, with the proviso that at least one of G7 or G8 is a C10.30 aryl or heteroaryl group substituted in one or both ortho- positions with a secondary or<br>
tertiary alkyl- or cycloalkyl- ligand, most preferably one of G7 and G8 is hydrogen and the<br>
5<br><br>
other is a phenyl, pyridinyl, naphthyl or anthracenyl group substituted at one or both of the ortho- positions (where possible) with an isopropyl, t-butyl, cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl group, and<br>
bonds, optional bonds and electron pair donative interactions are represented by lines, 5      dotted lines and arrows respectively.<br>
Highly preferred polyfunctional Lewis base compounds and metal complexes for use herein correspond to the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein X"" each occurrence is halide, N,N-dimethylamido, benzyl, Ci_2o alkyl, or tri(methyl)silyl- substituted alkyl, preferably each occurrence X"" is methyl, benzyl, chloro, or tri(methyl)silylmethyl; and Gd is isopropyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, it has been discovered that the presence of one or more silyl- substituted hydrocarbyl X"" groups, such as tri(methyl)silyl-methyl groups, improves the solubility of the metal complexes in aliphatic hydrocarbon diluents and results in extremely high polymerization efficiency.<br>
It is expressly intended that the foregoing disclosure of preferred, more preferred, highly preferred, and most preferred embodiments of specific substituents with respect to any one of the foregoing formulas of the invention is applicable as well to any other of the preceding or succeeding formulas independent of any other substituent identity.<br>
The above described metal complexes of the invention are typically activated in various ways to yield catalyst compounds having a vacant coordination site that will coordinate, insert, and polymerize addition polymerizable monomers, especially olefin(s). For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims, the term "activator" is defined to be any compound or component or method which can activate any of the catalyst compounds of the invention as described above. Non-limiting examples of suitable activators include Lewis acids, non-coordinating ionic activators, ionizing activators, organometal compounds, and combinations of the foregoing substances that can convert a neutral catalyst compound to a catalytically active species.<br>
It is believed, without desiring to be bound by such belief, that in one embodiment of the invention, catalyst activation may involve formation of a cationic, partially cationic, or zwitterionic species, by means of proton transfer, oxidation, or other suitable activation process. It is to be understood that the present invention is operable and fully enabled regardless of whether or not such an identifiable cationic, partially cationic, or zwitterionic species actually results during the activation process, also interchangeably referred to herein as an "ionization" process or "ionic activator".<br>
One suitable class of organometal activators or cocatalysts are alumoxanes, also referred to as alkylaluminoxanes. Alumoxanes are well known activators for use with metallocene type catalyst compounds to prepare addition polymerization catalysts. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Patents 4,665,208,4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734,4,924, 018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451 5,744,656; European publications EP-A-561476, EP-A-279586 and EP-A-594218; and PCT<br>
n<br><br>
publication WO 94/10180. Preferred alumoxanes are tri(C3.6)alkylalmunium modified methylalumoxane, especially tri(isobutyl)aluminum modified methylalumoxane, available commercially as MMAO-3A, from Akzo Nobel, Inc.<br>
It is within the scope of this invention to use alumoxane(s) or modified alumoxane(s)<br>
&gt;      as an activator or as a tertiary component in the invented process. That is, the compound may be used alone or in combination with other activators, neutral or ionic, such as tri(aU<yl tetrakis compounds trisperfluoroaryl polyhalogenated heteroborane anions and combinations thereof. when used as a tertiary component the amount of alumoxane employed is generally less than></yl>
     that necessary to effectively activate the metal complex when employed alone. In this<br>
embodiment, it is believed, without wishing to be bound by such belief, that the alumoxane does not contribute significantly to actual catalyst activation. Not withstanding the foregoing, it is to be understood that some participation of the alumoxane in the activation process is not necessarily excluded.<br>
	Ionizing cocatalysts may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated<br>
with, but not coordinated to or only loosely coordinated to, an anion of the ionizing compound. Such compounds are described in European publications EP-A-570982, EP-A-520732, EP-A-495375, EP-A-500944, EP-A-277 003 and EP-A-277004, and U.S. Patents: 5,153,157, 5,198,401, 5,066,741, 5,206,197, 5,241,025, 5,384,299 and 5,502,124. Preferred<br>
     among the foregoing activators are ammonium cation containing salts, especially those containing trihydrocarbyl- substituted ammonium cations containing one or two C10-4o alkyl groups, especially methylbis(octadecyl)ammonium- and methylbis(tetradecyl)-ammonium-cations and a non-coordinating anion, especially a tetrakis(perfluoro)arylborate anion, especially tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. It is further understood that the cation may<br>
      comprise a mixture of hydrocarbyl groups of differing lengths. For example, the protonated ammonium cation derived from the commercially available long-chain amine comprising a mixture of two CH, Qe or Ci8 alkyl groups and one methyl group. Such amines are available from Witco Corp., under the trade name Kemamine™ T9701, and from Akzo-Nobel under the trade name Armeen™ M2HT. A most preferred ammonium salt activator is methyldi(Ci4-<br>
    2oalkj'l)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate.<br>
Activation methods using ionizing ionic compounds not containing an active proton but capable of forming active catalyst compositions, such as ferrocenium salts of the foregoing non-coordinating anions are also contemplated for use herein, and are described in EP-A-426637, EP-A-573403 and U.S. Patent 5,387,568.<br><br>
A class of cocatalysts comprising non-coordinating anions generically referred to as expanded anions, further disclosed in U. S. Patent 6,395,671, may be suitably employed to activate the metal complexes of the present invention for olefin polymerization. Generally, these cocatalysts (illustrated by those having imidazolide, substituted imidazolide, 5      imidazolinide, substituted imidazolinide, benzimidazolide, or substituted benzimidazolide anions) may be depicted as follows:<br><br><br><br>
tris (2, 2', 2"-nonafluorobiphenyl) fluoroaluminate. Combinations of activators are also<br>
15      contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in<br>
combinations, see for example, EP-A-0 573120, PCT publications WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and US Patents 5,153,157 and 5,453,410. WO 98/09996 describes activating catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates, including their hydrates. WO 99/18135 describes the use of organoboroaluminum activators. EP-A-781299 describes using<br>
20      a silylium salt in combination with a non-coordinating compatible anion. Other activators or<br>
methods for activating a catalyst compound are described in for example, U. S.<br>
Patents 5,849,852, 5,859, 653, 5,869,723, EP-A-615981, and PCT publication WO 98/32775.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention that the above described metal complexes<br>
can be combined with more than one of the activators or activation methods described above.<br>
25      The mole ratio of the activator component(s) to the metal complex in the catalyst<br>
compositions of the invention suitably is in the range of between 0.3:1 to 2000:1, preferably 1:1 to 800:1, and most preferably 1:1 to 500:1. Where the activator is an ionizing activator such as those based on the anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron or the strong Lewis acid trispentafluorophenylboron, the mole ratio of the metal or metalloid of the activator<br>
30      component to the metal complex is preferably in the range of between 0.3:1 to 3:1.<br>
Tertiary Components<br>
In addition to the metal complex and cocatalyst or activator, it is contemplated that certain tertiary components or mixtures thereof may be added to the catalyst composition or 35      the reaction mixture in order to obtain improved catalyst performance or other benefit.<br>
10<br><br>
Examples of such tertiary components include scavengers designed to react with contaminants in the reaction mixture to prevent catalyst deactivation. Suitable tertiary components may also activate or assist in activation of one or more of the metal complexes employed in the catalyst composition.<br>
Examples include Lewis acids, such as trialkylaluminum compounds, dialkylzinc compounds, dialkylaluminumalkoxides, dialkylaluminumaryloxides, dialkylaluminum N,N-dialkylamides, di(trialkylsilyl)aluminum JSl,N-dialkylamides, dialkylaluniinum N,N-di(trialkylsilyl)amides, alkylaluminumdialkoxides, alkylaluminum di(N,N-dialkylamides), tri(alkyl)silylaluminum N,N-dialkylamides, alkylaluminum N,N-di(trialkylsilyl)amides, alkylaluminum diaryloxides, alkylaluminum |X-bridged bis(amides) such as bis(ethylaluminum)-l-phenylene-2-(phenyl)amido u.-bis(diphenylamide), and/or alumoxanes; as well as Lewis bases, such as organic ether, polyether, amine, and polyamine compounds. Many of the foregoing compounds and their use in polymerizations is disclosed in U. S. Patents 5, 712,352 and 5,763,543, and in WO 96/08520.

Another example of a suitable tertiary component is a hydroxycarboxylate metal salt, by which is meant any hydroxy-substituted, mono-, di- or tri-carboxylic acid salt wherein the metal portion is a cationic derivative of a metal from Groups 1-13 of the Periodic Table of Elements. This compound may be used to improve polymer morphology especially in a gas phase polymerization. Non- limiting examples include saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, aromatic or saturated cyclic, substituted carboxylic acid salts where the carboxylate ligand has from one to three hydroxy substituents and from 1 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples include hydroxyacetate, hydroxypropionate, hydroxybutyrate, hydroxyvalerate, hydroxypivalate, hydroxycaproate, hydroxycaprylate, hydroxyheptanate, hydroxypelargonate, hydroxyundecanoate, hydroxyoleate, hydroxyoctoate, hydroxyalmitate, hydroxymyristate,<br>

The prepolymerization can be carried out batchwise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination and/or in the<br>
10      presence of any molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen. For examples of<br>
prepolymerization procedures, see U. S. Patents 4,748,221,4,789,359, 4,923,833, 4,921,825, 5,283,278 and 5,705,578, European publication EP-A-279863, and PCT Publication WO 97/44371. A prepolymerized catalyst composition for purposes of this patent specification and appended claims preferably is a supported catalyst system.<br>
15	The method for making the catalyst composition generally involves the combining,<br>
contacting, blending, and/or mixing of the respective catalyst components, optionally in the presence of the monomer or monomers to be polymerized. Ideally, the contacting is conducted under inert conditions at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 100 °C, more preferably from 15 to 75 °C, most preferably at ambient temperature and pressure. The<br>
20      contacting is desirably performed under an inert gaseous atmosphere, such as nitrogen,<br>
however, it is also contemplated that the combination may be performed in the presence of olefin(s), solvents, and hydrogen.<br>
Mixing techniques and equipment contemplated for use in the method of the invention are well known. Mixing techniques may involve any mechanical mixing means, for<br>
25      example shaking, stirring, tumbling, and rolling. Another technique contemplated involves the use of fluidization, for example in a fluid bed reactor vessel where circulated gases provide the mixing.<br>
For supported catalyst compositions, the catalyst composition is substantially dried and/or free flowing. In a preferred embodiment, the various components are contacted in a<br>
30      rotary mixer, tumble mixer, or in a fluidized bed mixing process, under a nitrogen atmosphere, and any liquid diluent is subsequently removed.<br>

35      least one of which is ethylene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, or propylene. The invention is<br>
21<br><br>
particularly well suited to processes wherein propylene, 1-butene, or 4-methyl-l-pentene is homopolymerized, ethylene and propylene are copolymerized, or ethylene, propylene, or a mixture thereof is copolymerized with one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of 1-octene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, ethylidenenorbornene, 2,4-hexadiene, and 1-!     butene.

Typically, in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. Examples of such processes are disclosed in U. S. Patents 4,543,399, 4,588,790,5,028,670, 5,317,036,5,352,749,5,405,922,5,436,304,5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228.<br>

The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from 30 to 120 °C, preferably from 60 to 115 °C, more preferably from 70 to 110 °C, and most preferably from 70 to 95 °C.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of frorn 100 kPa to 5 MPa, and temperatures in the range of 0 to 120 °C. hi a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent to which monomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the<br>

Polymerisation Runs 1-21<br>
Polymerizations are conducted in a computer controlled, stirred, jacketed 1.8 L stainless steel autoclave solution batch reactor. The bottom of the reactor is fitted with a large orifice bottom dump valve, which empties the reactor contents into a 6 L stainless steel container. The container is vented to a 30 gal. blowdown tank, with both the container and the tank are purged with nitrogen. All chemicals used for polymerization or catalyst makeup are run through purification columns, to remove any impurities. Propylene and solvent, mixed alkanes (Isopar E ™ available from Exxon Mobil Chemicals Inc.) or toluene, are passed through 2 columns, the first containing alumina, the second containing a purifying reactant (Q5™ available from Englehardt Corporation). Nitrogen and hydrogen gases are passed through a single column containing Q5™ reactant.<br>
The autoclave is cooled to 25 °C before loading. It was charged with 667g mixed alkanes, hydrogen (using a calibrated 50 mL shot tank and a differential pressure in the shot tank of 0.41MPa), followed by 286g of propylene using a micro-motion flowmeter. The reactor is then brought to 90°C or 120 °C before addition of catalyst composition.<br>
The metal complex (catalyst) (1.0 |jmole) is dissolved in 5 ml toluene. The metal complex and hexane solutions of activator and tertiary component are handled in an inert glovebox, mixed together in a vial, drawn into a syringe and pressure transferred into the catalyst shot tank. This is followed by 3 rinses of toluene, 5 mL each. The cocatalyst used is a long-chain alkyl ammonium borate of approximate stoichiometry equal to methyldi(octadecyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (MDB). The tertiary component used is tri(i-propyl)aluminum modified methylalumoxane (PMAO-IP™, available from Akzo Noble, Inc.) (MAO) or di(n-octyl)aluminum 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenoxide (DAP) in a molar ratio (metal complex : cocatalyst: tertiary component) of 1:1.2:30. The shot tank is pressurized with N2 to 0.6 MPa above the reactor pressure, and the contents are quickly blown into the reactor. Both reaction exotherm and pressure drop are monitored throughout the reaction run time.<br>
After 10 minutes polymerization, the agitator is stopped, the reactor pressure is increased to 3.4 MPa withN2, and the bottom dump valve opened to empty reactor contents to<br>

the collection vessel. The contents are poured into trays and placed in a lab hood where the solvent is evaporated overnight. The trays are then transferred to a vacuum oven, where they are heated to 145 °C under vacuum to remove any remaining solvent. After the trays cooled to ambient temperature, the polymers are quantified and analyzed.<br>

The metal complex (catalyst) (1.0 umole) is dissolved in 5 ml toluene. The metal complex and hexane solutions of activator and tertiary component are handled in an inert glovebox, mixed together in a vial, drawn into a syringe and pressure transferred into the catalyst shot tank. This is followed by 3 rinses of toluene, 5 mL each. The cocatalyst used is a long-chain alkyl ammonium borate of approximate stoichiometry equal to methyldi(octadecyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (MDB). The tertiary component used is tri(i-propyl)aluminum modified methylalumoxane (PMAO-IP™, available from Akzo Noble, Inc.) (MAO) or di(n-octyl)aluminum 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenoxide (DAP) in a molar ratio (metal complex : cocatalyst: tertiary component) of 1:1.2:30. The shot tank is pressurized with N2 to 0.6 MPa above the reactor pressure, and the contents are quickly blown into the reactor. Both reaction exotherm and pressure drop are monitored throughout the reaction run time.<br>
After 10 minutes polymerization, the agitator is stopped, the reactor pressure is increased to 3.4 MPa with N2, and the bottom dump valve opened to empty reactor contents to<br>
31<br><br>
the collection vessel. The contents are poured into trays and placed in a lab hood where the solvent is evaporated overnight. The trays are then transferred to a vacuum oven, where they are heated to 145 °C under vacuum to remove any remaining solvent. After the trays cooled to ambient temperature, the polymers are quantified and analyzed.<br>
Runs in groups 1-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10,11-14,15-18,19, and 20-21 were conducted at different times and are not intended for use in comparisons between groups. Results are contained in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Polymerization Runs 22-30<br>
The 90 °C polymerization conditions of Runs 1-21 are substantially repeated using different cocatalyst/ tertiary component combinations. The cocatalysts tested are MDB, the methyldi(C)4.2o alkyl)ammonium salt of bis(tris(pentafluorophenyl)alumane)-2-5      undecylimidazolide (MBU) or the methyldi(Ci4.2o alkyl)ammonium salt of<br>
bis(tris(pentafluorophenyl)alurnane)imidazolide (MB1), both salts having been prepared according to the teachings of U. S. Patent 6,395,671. The tertiary compounds tested were MAO, DAP and triemylaluminum (TEA). The results are contained in Table 2.<br><br>
Continuous Solution Polymerizations. Runs 31-38<br>
Continuous polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent, ethylene (where used), hydrogen, and propylene are supplied to a 3.8 L reactor equipped with a jacket for<br>
20      temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. The propylene feed is measured by a mass flow meter and the flow is controlled by a variable speed diaphragm pump. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst injection line and the reactor agitator.<br>
25      The remaining solvent is combined with hydrogen and delivered to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen into the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters, and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent. This stream<br>
30      enters the bottom of the reactor, but in a different port than the port used for the monomer<br>
