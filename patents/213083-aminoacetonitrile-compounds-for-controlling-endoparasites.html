AMINOACETONITRILE COMPOUNDS FOR CONTROLLING ENDOPARASITES<br>
The present invention relates to the use of known aminoacetonitrile compounds in the control of endoparasites, especially helminths, in warm-blooded productive livestock and domestic animals.<br>
Attempts have been made to control helminths, in which the endoparasitic nematodes may be the cause of serious diseases of mammals and poultry, by using a few minor classes of active ingredients, for example milbemycins. However, the active ingredients disclosed up until now in literature cannot always fulfil the requirements regarding potency and activity spectrum. There is therefore a need for active ingredients with improved pesticidal properties. It has now been found that the aminoacetonitrile compounds described here possess outstanding properties against endoparasites.<br>
Aminoacetonitrile compounds with pesticidal, especially insecticidal, activity for the protection of plants are described for example in EP 0 953 565 A2. It has surprisingly been shown that the following selection of compounds of formula I also have exceptionally good activity against endoparasites of warm-blooded animals and are tolerated extremely well by the host animal.<br>
The compounds correspond to the general formula<br>
wherein <br>
is 1, 2 or 3;<br>
R1 is C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy or halogen, whereby the substituents may respectively be identical or different, if m is greater than 1; and<br>
R2 is C1-C4-haloalkyl;<br>
and optional enantiomers thereof.<br>
Alkyl - as a group perse and as structural element of other groups and compounds such as halogen-alkyi and alkoxy, - is, in each case with due consideration of the specific number of<br><br>
caroon atoms in tne group or compound in question, either straight-chained, i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, or branched, e.g. isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tort-butyl.<br>
As a rule, halogen signifies fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The same applies to halogen in combination with other significances, such as halogenalkyl or halogenalkoxy. Preference is given to fluorine or chlorine, especially fluorine.<br>
Halogen-substituted carbon-containing groups and compounds may be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents may be identical or different. Examples of haloalkyl - as a group perse and as structural element of other groups and compounds such as haloalkoxy - are methyl which is mono- to trisubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CHF2 or CF3; ethyl which is mono- to pentasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CH2CF3, CF2CF3, CF2CCI3, CF2CHCI2, CF2CHF2| CFaCFCfe, CF2CHBr2, CF2CHCIF, CF2CHBrF or CCIFCHCIF; propyl or isopropyl, mono- to heptasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CH2CHBrCH2Br, CF2CHFCF3) CH2CF2CF3 or CH(CF3)2; butyl or one of its isomers, mono- to nonasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CF(CF3)CHFCF3 or CH2(CF2)2CF3.<br>
Alkoxy groups preferably have a chain length of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Alkoxy is for example methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec.-butoxy and tert.-butoxy, preferably methoxy and ethoxy. Halogenalkoxy groups preferably have a chain length of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Halogenalkoxy is e.g. fluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy, 2-fluoroethoxy, 2-chloroethoxy, 2,2-difluoroethoxy and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxy; preferably difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethoxy.<br>
Preferred embodiments within the scope of the invention are:<br>
(1)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
m is 1 or 2,<br>
preferably 2;<br>
(2)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
Ri is Ci-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl or halogen;<br>
preferably Ci-C2-alkyl, C1-C2-haloalkyl or halogen;<br>
most preferably methyl, d-haloalkyl, chlorine or fluorine,<br>
whereby the substituents may be respectively identical or different, if m is greater than 1;<br><br>
(3)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
R2 is C1-C2-haloalkyl;<br>
preferably d-haloalkyl,<br>
most preferably trifluoromethyl;<br>
(4)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
m is 1 or 2,<br>
R1 is C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl or halogen, whereby the substituents may respectively be identical or different, if m is greater than 1; and R2 is C1-C2-haloalkyl;<br>
(5)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
m is 2;<br>
RT is C1-C2-alkyl, C1-C2-haloalkyl or halogen, whereby the substituents may respectively be identical or different, and R2 is Crhaloalkyl;<br>
(6)	A compound of formula I, wherein<br>
m is 2;<br>
R1 is methyl, halomethyl, chlorine or fluorine, whereby the substituents may be respectively identical or different; and R2 is trifluoromethyl.<br>
The compounds of formula I named in the following Table 1 are preferred in particular.<br>
The compounds I may be present in the form of one of the possible isomers or as a mixture thereof, e.g. depending on the number, absolute and relative configurations of the asymmetric carbon atoms as pure isomers, such as antipodes and/or diastereoisomers, or as isomeric mixtures, such as enantiomeric mixtures, e.g. racemates, diastereoisomeric mixtures or racemic mixtures; the invention relates to both the pure isomers and all the possible isomeric mixtures, and is to be understood as such hereinbefore and hereinafter, even if stereochemical details are not specifically mentioned in each case.<br>
Synthesis of the compounds is described for example in EP 0 953 565 A2.<br><br><br><br>

The compounds I according to the invention are notable for their broad activity spectrum<br>
•i<br>
and are valuable active^ingredients in the field of pest control, including in particular the control of endoparasites, particularly helminths, on animals, whilst being well-tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants. These include the endoparasitic nematodes which may be the cause of serious diseases of mammals and poultry, e.g. sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, horses, donkeys, dogs, cats, guinea-pigs and exotic birds. Typical nematodes of this indication are: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostonum, Oesophagostonum, Charbertia, Trichuris, Strongylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus, Capfflaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris and Parascaris. The particular advantage of the compounds of formula I is their efficacy against those parasites that are resistant towards active ingredients based on benzimidazole.<br>
Certain pests of the species Nematodirus, Cooperia and Oesophagostonum infest the intestinal tract of the host animal, while others of the species Haemonchus and Ostertagia are parasitic in the stomach and those of the species Dictyocaulus are parasitic in the lung tissue. Parasites of the families Filariidae and Setariidae may be found in the internal cell tissue and in the organs, e.g. the heart, the blood vessels, the lymph vessels and the subcutaneous tissue. A particularly notable parasite is the heartworm of the dog, Dirofilaria immitis. The compounds of formula I are highly effective against these parasites.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I are suitable for the control of human pathogenic parasites. Of these, typical representatives that appear in the digestive tract are those of the species Ancylostoma, Necator, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichuris and Enterobius. The compounds of the present invention are also effective against parasites of the species Wuchereria, Brugia, Onchocerca and Loa from the family of Filariidae, which appear in the blood, in the tissue and in various organs, and also against Dracunculus and parasites of the species Strongyloides and Trichinella, which infect the gastrointestinal tract in particular.<br>
The good pesticidal activity of the compounds of formula I according to the invention corresponds to a mortality rate of at least 50-60% of the pests mentioned. In particular, the compounds of formula I are notable for the exceptionally long duration of efficacy.<br>
The compounds of formula I are preferably employed in unmodified form or preferably together with the adjuvants conventionally used in the art of formulation and may therefore<br><br>
be processed in a known manner to give, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, directly dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, soluble powders* granules or microencapsulations in polymeric substances. As with the compositions, the methods of application are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The formulation, i.e. the agents, preparations or compositions containing the active ingredient of formula I, or combinations of these active ingredients with other active ingredients, and optionally a solid or liquid adjuvant, are produced in a manner known per se, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with spreading compositions, for example with solvents, solid carriers, and optionally surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The solvents in question may be: alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl or -ethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetanol alcohol, strong polar solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide, or water, vegetable oils, such as rape, castor, coconut, or soybean oil, and also, if appropriate, silicone oils.<br>
Preferred application forms for usage on warm-blooded animals in the control of helminths include solutions, emulsions, suspensions (drenches), food additives, powders, tablets including effervescent tablets, boli, capsules, micro-capsules and pour-on formulations, whereby the physiological compatibility of the formulation excipients must be taken into consideration.<br>
The binders for tablets and boli may be chemically modified polymeric natural substances that are soluble in water or in alcohol, such as starch, cellulose or protein derivatives (e.g. methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, proteins such as zein, gelatin and the like), as well as synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone etc. The tablets also contain fillers (e.g. starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sugar, lactose etc.), glidants and disintegrants.<br>
If the anthelminthics are present in the form of feed concentrates, then the carriers used are e.g. performance feeds, feed grain or protein concentrates. Such feed concentrates or compositions may contain, apart from the active ingredients, also additives, vitamins, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics or other pesticides, primarily bacteriostats, fungistats, coccidiostats, or even hormone preparations, substances having anabolic action or<br><br>
substances which promote growth, which affect the quality of meat of animals for slaughter or^which are beneficial to the organism in another way. If the compositions or the active ingredients of formula I contained therein are added directly to feed or to the drinking troughs, then the formulated feed or drink contains the active ingredients preferably in a concentration of ca. 0.0005 to 0.02 % by weight (5-200 ppm).<br>
The compounds of formula I according to the invention may be used alone or in combination with other biocides. They may be combined with pesticides having the same sphere of activity e.g. to increase activity, or with substances having another sphere of activity e.g. to broaden the range of activity. It can also be sensible to add so-called repellents. If the range of activity is to be extended to endoparasites, e.g. wormers, the compounds of formula I are suitably combined with substances having endoparasitic properties. Of course, they can also be used in combination with antibacterial compositions. Since the compounds of formula I are adulticides, i.e. since they are effective in particular against the adult stage of the target parasites, the addition of pesticides which instead attack the juvenile stages of the parasites may be very advantageous. In this way, the greatest part of those parasites that produce great economic damage will be covered. Moreover, this action will contribute substantially to avoiding the formation of resistance. Many combinations may also lead to synergistic effects, i.e. the total amount of active ingredient can be reduced, which is desirable from an ecological point of view. Preferred groups of combination partners and especially preferred combination partners are named in the following, whereby combinations may contain one or more of these partners in addition to a compound of formula I.<br>
Suitable partners in the mixture may be biocides, e.g. the insecticides and acaricides with a varying mechanism of activity, which are named in the following and have been known to the person skilled in the art for a long time, e.g. chitin synthesis inhibitors, growth regulators; active ingredients which act as juvenile hormones; active ingredients which act as adulticides; broad-band insecticides, broad-band acaricides and nematicides; and also the well known anthelminthics and insect- and/or acarid-deterring substances, said repellents or detachers.<br>

As a consequence of the above details, a further essential aspect of the present invention relates to combination preparations for the control of parasites on warm-blooded animals, characterised in that they contain, in addition to a compound of formula I, at least one further active ingredient having the same or different sphere of activity and at least one physiologically acceptable carrier. The present invention is not restricted to two-fold combinations.<br>
As a rule, the anthelminthic compositions according to the invention contain 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 95 % by weight of active ingredient of formula I or mixtures thereof, 99.9 to 1 % by weight, especially 99.8 to 5 % by weight of a solid or liquid admixture, including 0 to 25 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 25 % by weight of a surfactant.<br>
Application of the compositions according to the invention to the animals to be treated may take place topically, perorally, parenterally or subcutaneously, the composition being<br><br>
present in the form of solutions, emulsions, suspensions, (drenches), powders, tablets, boli, capsules and^pour-on formulations.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method consists in applying the compound of formula I to a specific location of the skin or coat, advantageously to the neck or backbone of the animal. This takes place e.g. by applying a swab or spray of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively small area of the coat, from where the active substance is dispersed almost automatically over wide areas of the fur owing to the spreading nature of the components in the formulation and assisted by the animal's movements.<br>
Pour-on or spot-on formulations suitably contain carriers, which promote rapid dispersement over the skin surface or in the coat of the host animal, and are generally regarded as spreading oils. Suitable carriers are e.g. oily solutions; alcoholic and isopropanolic solutions such as solutions of 2-octyldodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalate, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, capric acid esters of saturated fat alcohols of chain length Ci2-C18; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisdpropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or also solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols. It may be advantageous for a dispersing agent to be additionally present, such as one known from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industry. Examples are 2-pyrrolidone, 2-(N-alkyl)pyrrolidone, acetone, polyethylene glycol and the ethers and esters thereof, propyiene glycol or synthetic triglycerides.<br>
The oily solutions include e.g. vegetable oils such as olive oil, groundnut oil, sesame oil, pine oil, linseed oil or castor oil. The vegetable oils may also be present in epoxidised form. Paraffins and silicone oils may also be used.<br>
A pour-on or spot-on formulation generally contains 1 to 20 % by weight of a compound of formula I, 0,1 to 50 % by weight of dispersing agent and 45 to 98.9 % by weight of solvent.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method is especially advantageous for use on herd animals such as cattle, horses, sheep or pigs, in which it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or by injection. Because of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals or pets, and is greatly favoured by the keepers of the animals, as it can often be carried out without the specialist presence of the veterinarian.<br><br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will V normally use dilute formulations.<br>
Such compositions may also contain further additives, such as stabilisers, anti-foaming agents, viscosity regulators, binding agents or tackifiers, as well as other active ingredients, in order to achieve special effects.<br>
Anthelminthic compositions of this type, which are used by the end user, similarly form a constituent of the present invention.<br>
In each of the processes according to the invention for pest control or in each of the pest control compositions according to the invention, the active ingredients of formula I can be used in all of their steric configurations or in mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention also includes a method of prophylactically protecting warm-blooded animals, especially productive livestock, domestic animals and pets, against parasitic helminths, which is characterised in that the active ingredients of formula I or the active ingredient formulations prepared therefrom are administered to the animals as an additive to the feed, or to the drinks or also in solid or liquid form, orally or by injection or parenterally. The invention also includes the compounds of formula I according to the invention for usage in one of the said processes.<br>

The aqueous systems may also preferably be used for oral and/or intraruminal application.<br>
The compositions may also contain further additives, such as stabilisers, e.g. where appropriate epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rapeseed oil, or soybean oil); antifoams, e.g. silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers, as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients to achieve special effects.<br>
Further biologically active substances or additives, which are neutral towards the compounds of formula I and do not have a harmful effect on the host animal to be treated, as well as mineral salts or vitamins, may also be added to the described compositions.<br>
Biological Examples:<br>
1. In-vivo test on Trichostronavlus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus on Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unauiculatus) using peroral application<br>
Six to eight week old Mongolian gerbils are infected by artificial feeding with ca. 2000 third instar larvae each of 7. colubriformis and H. contortus. 6 days after infection, the gerbils are lightly anaesthetised with N20 and treated by peroral application with the test compounds, dissolved in a mixture of 2 parts DMSO and 1 part polyethylene glycol (PEG 300), in quantities of 100, 32 and 10 -0.1 mg/kg. On day 9 (3 days after treatment), when most of the H. contortus that are still present are late 4th instar larvae and most of the T. colubriformis are immature adults, the gerbils are killed in order to count the worms. The efficacy is calculated as the % reduction of the number of worms in each gerbil, compared with the geometric average of number of worms from 8 infected and untreated gerbils.<br>
In this test, a vast reduction in nematode infestation is achieved with compounds of<br><br>
formula I. In particular, compounds 1.31 and 1.61 show a 100% reduction at 32 mg/kg active ingredient and at least a 97% reduction at 10 mg/kg active ingredient.<br><br><br><br>
What we claim is:<br>
1.	Use of compounds of formula<br>
wherein <br>
is 1, 2 or 3;<br>
R! is C1-C4-alkyl, CrC4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy or halogen, whereby the<br>
substituents may respectively be identical or different, if m is greater than 1; and<br>
R2 is CrC4-haloalkyl;<br>
and optionally enantiomers thereof, in the control of endoparasitic pests in warm-blooded<br>
productive livestock and domestic animals<br>
2.	Composition for the control of pests according to claim 1, which contains as active ingredient at least one compound of formula I according to claim 1, in addition to carriers and/or dispersants.<br>
3.	Method of controlling pests according to claim 1, whereby a pesticidally active amount of at least one compound of formula I according to claim 1 is used on the pests.<br>
4.	Use of a compound of formula I according to claim 1 in a process for controlling parasites on warm-blooded animals.<br>
5.	Use of a compound of formula I according to claim 1 in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition against parasites.<br><br>
A use of a compound substantially as herein described and exemplified.<br><br></td>
