				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to spherical rubber chemicals and the method for<br>
preparing the same, more specifically, to spherical rubber antioxidants, vulcanization<br>
agents, processing aids, reinforcing agents and adhesive agents, especially to the spherical<br>
granules	of	p-phenylenediamine	type	rubber	antioxidant<br>
N-l ,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine	or	N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-<br>
p-phenylenediamine and the method for preparing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Rubber chemicals are important chemical materials in the rubber industry, and they<br>
play an important role in improving the rubber performance, such as upgrading the rubber<br>
quality and increasing the rubber processing level. With the continuous progress in the<br>
rubber industry, there is a higher demand for the general quality of rubber chemicals. At<br>
present, the rubber chemicals provided in market are generally of powdery or semispherical<br>
shape. The dust of powder rubber chemicals are likely to fly in the air, thereby causing loss<br>
of the rubber chemicals and imparting adverse effects on the environment.<br>
Currently, a common granulation method for rubber chemicals is the rotary belt<br>
condensation granulating process with the following operating principle: utilizing the low<br>
melting point (or softening point) characteristics of the material, the molten liquid material<br>
is distributed evenly on a steel belt moving at a uniform speed below a special distributing<br>
device depending on the viscosity range of the molten material. Meanwhile, under forced<br>
cooling of a continuously spraying device provided under the steel belt, the material is<br>
cooled and solidified during the movement and transportation procedure, thereby achieving<br>
the purpose of continuous granulation and formation. According to the material properties<br>
and the intended use, the distribution mode of intermittent drippling, continuous flowing<br>
and full-width overflowing may be employed to obtain semisphere, bar and sheet product,<br>
respectively. The method has the following defects: 1) the cooling medium removes heat<br>
from the molten liquid via the steel belt, and heat is transferred from the molten liquid to<br><br><br>
the steel belt and then to the cooling medium. So the heat transfer efficiency decreases<br>
significantly. Since the main heat transfer mode is heat conduction between the steel belt<br>
surface and the cooling medium, the length of steel belt must be prolonged to increase the<br>
throughput, resulting in larger facility bulk and lower space utilization efficiency. 2) Since<br>
the liquid drops are formed on the steel belt, the resultant granules show a semispherical or<br>
flat shape. Although they have some advantages over the powdery rubber chemicals, the<br>
semispherical or flat rubber chemicals still have defects. Specifically, some arris of sharp<br>
angle are formed at the boumdary of spherical surface and flat surface in the granulation<br>
process, and they may be broken off by collision during packaging and transportation and<br>
the reproduced powders also pollute the environment. In addition, the formed granules are<br>
scraped away from the steel belt at the end of steel belt, in which process dust may fly in the<br>
air. The presence of fine powders may cause decrease of melting point in partial regions of<br>
the rubber chemicals. Also, the fine powders may join together, conglomerate and harden<br>
and the wholly or partially hardening of the rubber chemical products makes a large bulk<br>
which deteriorates the product quality seriously. Thus, there requires novel form of rubber<br>
chemicals which solve the above problems in the field of rubber chemical granulation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the unfavorable granule shape in the existing<br>
granulation of rubber chemicals and solve the problems of dust pollution caused by the<br>
rubber chemicals of powder, semisphere or other irregular shape in the granulation process,<br>
low heat transfer efficiency, low production capability and relative high equipment costs,<br>
and to alleviate the quality problems of lower melting point in regions of the product due to<br>
the presence of fine powder crystals and wholly or partially hardening of the product due to<br>
joining, hardening and conglomeration of fine powders.<br>
The present inventors have found in various studies that the rubber chemicals formed<br>
in spherical shape eliminate the defects of the powdery or semispherical rubber chemicals<br>
prepared according to the existing manufacture processes. In contrast, the rubber chemicals<br>
according to the present invention have a much larger number of granules passing through<br><br><br>
sieve and a significantly increased granulation rate of product, thereby preventing the dust<br>
pollution caused in the granulation process and avoiding the material loss and<br>
environmental pollution. In addition, the quality problems of lower melting point in regions<br>
of the product due to the presence of fine powder crystals and wholly or partially hardening<br>
of the product due to joining, hardening and conglomeration of fine powders are also<br>
solved. Meanwhile, the rubber chemical granules have a higher surface smoothness which<br>
is helpful for flowing and mixing of the rubber chemicals in mixing or open milling process<br>
with rubbers. The present invention is carried out accordingly.<br>

DETAILED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a spherical rubber chemical, wherein the preferable<br>
average diameter of the spherical rubber chemical is 0.2-10mm. In addition, the present<br>
invention also provides the following method for preparing the spherical rubber chemical.<br>
They will be described in detail thereafter.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, raw material of the rubber chemical is pumped to the cooling<br>
and precrystallizing part, and after continuous circulating and cooling, a portion of the<br>
material reach a precrystallizing state and is delivered to a temperature-keeping tank for<br>
molten material in the head part for granulation. Alternatively, depending on its properties,<br>
the material may be fed directly into the temperature-keeping tank for molten material in<br>
the head part for granulation without the precrystallizing step. The material is granulated<br>
with a designed distribution plate. The extruded molten granules of spherical shape fall<br>
down into a cooling tower in which the material and the cooling liquid sufficiently<br>
exchange heat and at the same time the material solidifies slowly into solid spherical<br>
granules. The resultant solid spherical granules are further treated to remove the cooling<br>
liquid, wherein most cooling liquid may be removed by draining and then the spherical<br>
granules are dried to remove the remaining cooling liquid.<br>
Before the overhead granulation, the material, especially that from the precrystallizer,<br>
has very poor flowability since they are in a state between solid and liquid. And since the<br>
material has a high crystal seed concentration but does not crystallize, it has a variable<br>
viscosity varying from tens of CP to tens of thousands even million of CP. Thus, this<br>
requires a close control. Proper control over the viscosity range and over the crystallizing<br>
state of the material is a critical factor in granulation.<br>
In order to meet the high precision requirement of crystallization temperature control,<br>
especially in the overhead granulation step of the rubber chemicals, we adopt multiple<br>
means to stabilize the processing parameter, the temperature. Specifically, a<br>
temperature-keeping means is provided to the outside of the material tank, the distribution<br>
plate is maintained at a constant temperature, and the temperature of pipelines and the<br>
temperature of some moving parts are maintained. Various temperature-keeping means can<br><br><br>
be selected depending on different properties, for example, providing a heating and/or<br>
cooling medium including steam, heat conducting oil and water of different temperatures,<br>
or adopting an electrically heating control system to control strictly the precision of the<br>
temperature-keeping system, thereby keeping a constant temperature.<br>
The material is formed into a spherical shape after dripping from the nozzle. The state<br>
of the material in dripping is important for the formation of granules. Material drops may<br>
be formed by naturally trickling under gravity, under pressure by reciprocating motion or<br>
under a constant pressure applied on the material by a high viscosity feeding pump, so that<br>
the material is in a spherical shape after dripping from the nozzle. When the liquid material<br>
in the material tank has a very high viscosity, the mass transfer and heat transfer are very<br>
difficult. A little longer retention time will cause solidification or partial coagulation of the<br>
material. So an agitation means or a coil pipe may be used to improve the mass transfer and<br>
heat transfer. For a material with high crystal seed concentration and being prone to<br>
coagulation, dripping facilitated by reciprocating motion is preferable. Any method and<br>
apparatus for pressing materials by reciprocating motion in the art can be used in the<br>
present invention. In a preferable embodiment, a reciprocating pump is connected to the<br>
material tank, and a coil pipe is disposed in the material tank. A heating and/or cooling<br>
medium passes through the coil pipe to accurately control the temperature of the material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a preferable heating and/or cooling medium is water.<br>
The coil pipe moves following the frequency of the reciprocating pump, so that the material<br>
in the material tank is held in a moving state and does not coagulate while the dripping of<br>
material is facilitated by the reciprocating motion. In addition, the frequency of the<br>
reciprocating pump is adjustable. Preferably, the dripping rate of the nozzle is controlled at<br>
1-4 drops/second by adjusting the frequency of the reciprocating pump and more preferably,<br>
the dripping rate of the nozzle is controlled at 2-3 drops/second. Thus, the material will be<br>
drawn back as the reciprocating pump and coil pipe move upward, and when moving<br>
downward under a pressure, the material is extruded as spherical granules through the<br>
nozzle and falls down, thereby avoiding formation of material bar or jam of the nozzle.<br>
Considering that the drops of material with low crystal seed concentration are likely to<br><br><br>
break and conglutinate in water and that the materials with high crystal seed concentration<br>
are likely to solidify to block the nozzles, in the light of the characteristics of melt<br>
granulation process, the material tank is designed to be separated from the distribution plate<br>
with a thermal insulating layer which has openings only at places corresponding to the<br>
nozzles to allow a liquid to pass through the nozzles. Therefore, the material tank may have<br>
a different temperature from the distribution plate and the heat transfer between the<br>
material tank and the distribution plate is blocked. Thus, the temperature of the distribution<br>
plate can be adjusted according to the state of material in the material tank, achieving the<br>
objective of controlling the state of the material. This design has more flexibility in<br>
regulation and controlling of the material and is more feasible in industrial production.<br>
Three different holes can be disposed in the distribution plate from top to bottom:<br>
small holes for controlling the flow rate, intermediate holes with nozzles for dripping and<br>
formation of material, and large holes for shielding and temperature-keeping. Depending<br>
on the material condition, for example, for a material having a high crystal seed<br>
concentration and unlikely to coagulate, the temperature-keeping large holes can be<br>
omitted. Depending on the characteristics of products, the distribution plate preferably has<br>
a plurality of evenly-distributed small holes, intermediate holes, optional large holes and<br>
inner temperature-keeping channels. The small holes have a diameter of 0.1-5 mm, the<br>
diameter of the intermediate hole nozzles depends on the required diameter of granules and<br>
is 0.2-10 mm, and the distance between the inner wall of a large hole (i.e. a<br>
temperature-keeping hole) and the outer wall of an intermediate hole nozzle is 0.5-5 mm.<br>
The nozzle may have different forms, for example the nozzle A, B and C shown in Figure 3.<br>
Preferably, the nozzle has a chamfer angle at its lower end, and the preferable nozzles<br>
among A, B and C are nozzles A and C. The nozzle A has an outer chamfer angle at its<br>
lower end, and nozzle C has an inner chamfer angle at its lower end. More preferably, the<br>
nozzle is nozzle A which has an outer chamfer angle. Moreover, temperature-keeping<br>
channels are formed between the nozzles of the distribution plate. A heating and/or cooling<br>
medium, such as steam, water or conducting oil, may be provided in the<br>
temperature-keeping channels according to the temperature requirement to keep a constant<br><br><br>
temperature of the distribution plate, thereby maintaining a stable material state.<br>
In the cooling and forming step, different cooling liquids may be selected for the<br>
granulation of different products. The cooling liquid may be water, aqueous ammonia, an<br>
aqueous solution of a salt, an organic substance and a mixture of two or more of the same.<br>
For example, the cooling liquid may be an aqueous solution of methanol, an aqueous<br>
solution of sodium chloride, gasoline, acetone, etc.<br>
In a preferable embodiment of the present invention, the rubber chemical material<br>
comes into contact directly with the cooling liquid in the cooling and forming step. Water is<br>
used as the cooling liquid so that the heat exchanging efficiency is increased significantly.<br>
Since water has a high specific heat and a large convective heat transfer coefficient, direct<br>
contact takes the advantage of the high heat exchange efficiency of water. Meanwhile, a<br>
liquid drop in water exchanges heat with water via its all spherical surface, thereby<br>
achieving a three-dimensional heat transfer. While in the conventional art, the cooling<br>
device is a steel belt and water spray which have lower thermal conductivity and lower heat<br>
transfer coefficient. Moreover, the particles are cooled via the contact surface of the steel<br>
belt, so the heat transfer efficiency is limited. In a preferable embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a cooling tower is used in the cooling and forming step, so the equipment cost is<br>
reduced and the equipment efficiency per unit volume is increased significantly.<br>
In another preferable embodiment of the present invention, the preferable cooling<br>
liquid is an aqueous solution of methanol in the cooling and forming step. Since the<br>
aqueous solution of methanol has a lower density, the rubber chemical granules will fall<br>
down faster in the cooling liquid and are prevented from floating on the liquid to facilitate<br>
the formation of the granules.<br>
During falling and cooling of the material, it is frequently found that the material has<br>
an insufficient hardness even it has formed into granules. In the cooling and forming step,<br>
the temperature of the cooling liquid is very important for the solidification into solid<br>
granules, and it is important to control the temperature of the cooling liquid properly. A<br>
suitable temperature of the cooling liquid may be selected according to the properties of the<br>
material, such as the melting point of the material. For example, in a further preferable<br><br><br>
embodiment of the present invention, the rubber chemical is a p-phenylenediamine type<br>
antioxidant	N-l,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine	or<br>
N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, the cooling liquid is water, aqueous ammonia<br>
or an aqueous solution of methanol, preferably having a temperature of 10-40°, and more<br>
preferably having a temperature of 20-35°.<br>
In a preferable embodiment of the present invention, a surfactant is sprayed onto the<br>
surface of the cooling liquid in the cooling and forming step. If the rubber chemical<br>
granules sedimentate with a low sedimentation rate due to the presence of surface tension,<br>
it is likely that a drop of the rubber chemical falls down before the previous drop settles<br>
down, resulting in the superposition of two or even more drops which will impair the<br>
granule shape and the formation effect. In order to prevent this phenomenon, a surfactant<br>
sprayed on the surface of cooling liquid (such as water) or ultrasonic wave produced by an<br>
ultrasonic generator is employed to reduce the surface tension to facilitate the fast<br>
sedimentation of the granules, thereby solving the above problem.<br>
The surfactant which may be added into the cooling liquid to facilitate the granule<br>
sedimentation includes, but not limited to, the following examples: polyethers, such as<br>
polyethylene glycol ether, polypropylene glycol ether and fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene<br>
ether, and the mixture thereof; alkyl benzene sulfonate compounds; quaternary ammonium<br>
salt compounds; alkyl alcohol ammonium type surfactants; as well as betaine type<br>
surfactants, such as cocoamidopropyl betaine, dimethylalkyl betaine,<br>
N,N-dimethyl-N-alkoxymethylene betaine, etc. Specifically, the surfactant may be<br>
polyethylene glycol ether, such as polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (having a molecular<br>
weight of 200-1000), polyethylene glycol diethyl ether (having a molecular weight of<br>
200-1000) and polyethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether (having a molecular weight of<br>
200-1000); polypropylene glycol ether, such as polypropylene glycol dimethyl ether<br>
(having a molecular weight of 200-1000), polypropylene glycol diethyl ether (having a<br>
molecular weight of 200-1000) and polypropylene glycol methyl ethyl ether (having a<br>
molecular weight of 200-1000); fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether, such as those having<br>
6-18 carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol part and 3-25 of polymerization degree of<br><br><br>
polyoxyethylene, for example, AEO-7, i.e. C12H25O(CH2CH2O)7H. The surfactants of<br>
different performances can be selected for different rubber chemicals and different cooling<br>
liquids.<br>
Drying of the formed rubber chemical granules may utilize a fluidized bed or a<br>
vibrated fluidized bed. A band-type drying process and common oven drying process may<br>
also be used.<br>
In the method according to the present invention, the rubber chemical material<br>
produces a spherical outer surface under the action of surface tension or interfacial tension,<br>
so the resultant products have a good sphericity, that is, they are substantially in a spherical<br>
shape. The products thus obtained have an improved appearance quality, which improves<br>
the flowing and mixing behaviors of the rubber chemicals in mixing or open milling<br>
process with rubbers. According to the method of the present invention, the dust pollution<br>
of powdery materials is prevented, and the various dust pollution caused by break-off and<br>
collision of the arris at the boundary of spherical surface and flat surface of the<br>
semispherical granules are also avoided during the subsequent procedures such as<br>
packaging, transportation, discharging and using. With change in the granule shape, the<br>
present invention prevents the reduction of melting point due to too much dust in the<br>
subsequent procedures, so the quality problem of product is solved.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, little dust is produced in the<br>
granulation process. Although friction and collision may occur between the granules in<br>
some procedures, almost no dust is produced before drying since a small amount of cooling<br>
liquid remains on the surface of the granules and reduces the frictional strength largely.<br>
While some dust is produced in the drying process, since the fluidized bed for drying is<br>
closed, the dust is collected and cannot pollute the environment or affect the operator's<br>
health. The steel belt cooling process utilizes an open system and the granules must be<br>
scraped away from the steel belt, the produced dust accumulates as time lapses and will<br>
cause a lot of harm. In contrast, the granulation process according to the present invention<br>
makes a significant progress and improvement.<br>
The rubber chemical granules obtained according to the method of the present<br><br><br>
invention have not only a spherical shape but also a smooth surface. This is helpful to<br>
reduce the dust produced from friction during bag dumping and transportation.<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention, but do not<br>
limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of spherical granules of N-l,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p- phenylenediamine<br>
The molten material of prepared N-l,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine (4020) in a storage tank was pumped to the precrystallizing system with<br>
a pump capacity of 600 kg/hour. The temperature of the cooling water for the<br>
precrystallizer was maintained at 28-32°C and the temperature of the water for pipeline<br>
temperature-keeping was maintained at 46-48°C. After the material in the precrystallizer<br>
reached the discharging state, a discharging pump was started to deliver the material into<br>
the material tank. A jacket was provided outside the material tank for passing warm water<br>
of 48-49°C. The material tank was separated from the distribution plate with a thermal<br>
insulating layer which had openings only at places corresponding to the nozzles to allow<br>
the liquid material passing through the nozzles. Meanwhile, a reciprocating motion device<br>
over the material tank was actuated. A coil pipe was located under and connected to the<br>
reciprocating device. There was warm water of 48-49°C passing through the coil pipe. The<br>
material entered into the distribution plate and was granulated therein with a dripping rate<br>
of 2-3 drops/second. The distribution plate mainly included a plurality of equispaced holes<br>
and inner temperature-keeping channels, for example as shown in figure 2. The<br>
temperature-keeping channels were filled with warm water of 49-59°C. The small holes in<br>
the distribution plate had a diameter of 2.5 mm, the intermediate holes had a diameter of 4<br>
mm, and the distance between the inner wall of the large holes for temperature-keeping and<br>
the outer wall of the nozzles was 2 mm. The nozzles had a chamfer angle at the lower end,<br>
such as nozzle A shown in figure 3. After passing the nozzles, the material fell into a<br>
cooling tower with water as the cooling liquid. A surfactant AEO-7 was sprayed onto the<br>
water surface to facilitate the sedimentation of material granules. The granules fell down<br>
from top to bottom and settled on the bottom of the cooling tower. The temperature of the<br>
cooling water was controlled at 20-35°C to solidify the granules into solid spheres. The<br><br><br>
material flow then entered into the draining procedure in which an oscillating screen with<br>
frequency of 40 Hz was used. Then the material flow entered into the drying procedure<br>
with a vibrated fluidized bed, in which the temperature of the air-drying fluidizing gas was<br>
40°C. The final product was packed after being dried to meeting the quality requirement.<br>
The produced spherical granules had good sphericity. One hundred (100) spherical granules<br>
collected randomly were measured for their diameters with a vernier caliper and the<br>
average diameter of the spherical granules was determined as 4.6 mm. The data exhibited a<br>
good normal distribution.<br>

capacity of 600 kg/hour. The temperature of the cooling water for the precrystallizer was<br>
maintained at 55-60°C and the temperature of the water for pipeline temperature-keeping<br>
was maintained at 75-80°C. After the material in the precrystallizer reached the discharging<br>
state, a discharging pump was actuated to deliver the material into the material tank. A<br>
jacket was provided outside the material tank for passing warm water of 78-83°C. The<br>
material tank was separated from the distribution plate with a thermal insulating layer<br>
which had openings only at places corresponding to the nozzles to allow the liquid material<br>
passing through the nozzles. Meanwhile, a reciprocating motion device over the material<br>
tank was actuated. A coil pipe was located under and connected to the reciprocating device.<br>
There was warm water of 85-86°C passing through the coil pipe. The material entered into<br>
the distribution plate and was granulated therein with a dripping rate of 2-3 drops/second.<br>
The distribution plate mainly included a plurality of equispaced holes and inner<br>
temperature-keeping channels, for example as shown in figure 2. The temperature-keeping<br>
channels were filled with warm water of 75-85°C. The small holes in the distribution plate<br>
had a diameter of 2.5 mm, the intermediate holes had a diameter of 4 mm, and the distance<br>
between the inner wall of the large holes for temperature-keeping and the outer wall of the<br><br><br>
nozzle was 2 mm. The nozzles had a chamfer angle at the lower end, such as nozzle A<br>
shown in figure 3. After passing the nozzles, the material fell into a cooling tower with<br>
water as the cooling liquid. A surfactant AEO-7 was sprayed onto the water surface to<br>
facilitate the sedimentation of material granules. The granules fell down from top to bottom<br>
and settle on the bottom of the cooling tower. The temperature of cooling water was<br>
controlled at 20-35°C to solidify the granules into solid spheres. The material flow then<br>
entered into the draining and sieving procedure in which an oscillating screen with<br>
frequency of 40 Hz was used. Then the material flow entered into the drying procedure<br>
with a vibrated fluidized bed, in which the temperature of the air-drying fluidizing gas was<br>
70°C. The final product was packed after being dried to meet the quality requirement. The<br>
produced spherical granules had good sphericity. One hundred (100) spherical granules<br>
randomly collected were measured for their diameters with a vernier caliper and the<br>
average diameter of the spherical granules we determined as 4.6 mm. The data exhibited a<br>
normal distribution.<br>

50-60°C and the temperature of the water for pipeline temperature-keeping was maintained<br>
at 70-80°C. After the material in the precrystallizer reached the discharging state, a<br>
discharging pump was actuated to deliver the material into the material tank and the entire<br>
material tank was filled up with the material to maintain a pressure of 0.1-0.5 MPa. A jacket<br>
was provided outside the material tank for passing warm water of 75-85°C. The material<br>
tank was separated from the distribution plate with a thermal insulating layer which had<br>
openings only at places corresponding to the nozzles to allow the liquid material passing<br>
through the nozzles. The material entered into the distribution plate under the pressure<br><br><br>
produced from the discharging pump and was granulated therein with a dripping rate of 2-3<br>
drops/second. The distribution plate included a plurality of equispaced holes and inner<br>
temperature-keeping channels. The temperature-keeping channels were filled with warm<br>
water of 80-85°C. The small holes in the distribution plate had a diameter of 2.5 mm, the<br>
intermediate holes had a diameter of 4 mm, and there was no large hole for<br>
temperature-keeping. The nozzles had a chamfer angle at the lower end, such as nozzle A<br>
shown in figure 3. After passing the nozzles, the material fell into a cooling tower with<br>
water as the cooling liquid. A surfactant cocoamidopropyl betaine was sprayed onto the<br>
