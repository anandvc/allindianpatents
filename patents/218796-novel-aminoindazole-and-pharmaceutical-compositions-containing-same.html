Rl and R2 are, independently of one another, a hydrogen, (l-6C)alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl or heteroaryl, themselves optionally being substituted by 1 or more substituents chosen from halogen, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, CN, N02, NH2, OH, COOH, COOalkyl, CONH2, formyl, tR1fluoromethyl or tR1fluoromethoxy; to their isomers, to their mixtures, to their racemates, enantiomers, diastereoisomers or tautomers, and to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The deR1vatives of formula (I) can be obtained from the corresponding 3-amino deR1vatives (V) for which the nitrogen in the 1 -position is optionally protected with a group Pr. Pr is a tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl, tosyl, mesyl or benzyl radical or the<br><br>
groups known for the protection of the NH groups of aromatic heterocycles as indicated in T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-Interscience Publication (1999)<br><br>
The 3-amino lH-indazoles of formula (II) can be obtained by reaction of a 2-fluorobenzonitrile with hydrazine hydrate or hydrochloride at reflux for 2 to 18 hours in an alcohol of ethanol or n-butanol type according to R.F. Kaltenbach, Bioorg. Med.<br><br>
The compounds for which R5 and R6 are, independently of one another, chosen from the following radicals: hydrogen, halogen, CN, N02, NH2, OH, COOH, C(0)OR8, -0-C(0)R8, NR8R9, NHC(0)R8, C(0)NR8R9, NHC(S)R8, C(S)NR8R9, SR8, S(0)R8, S02R8, NHSO2R8, S02NR8R9, -O-SO2R8, -SO2-O-R8, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, aryl, aryl(l-6C)alkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaryl(l-6C)alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or adamantyl; these radicals optionally being substituted by 1 or more substituents chosen from halogen, CN, N02, NH2, OH, OR10, COOH, C(O)OR10, -O-C(O)R10, NR10R11, NHC(O)R10, C(O)NR10Rll, NHC(S)R10, C(S)NR10R11, SR10, S(O)R10, SO2R10, NHSO2R10, SO2NRIORH, -O-SO2RIO, -SO2-O-RIO, aryl, heteroaryl, formyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy or (l-6C)alkyl; can be obtained by reactions involving the chemistry of palladium: Suzuki (A. Suzuki, Pure Appl. Chem., 63, 419-22 (1991), Stille (J. Stille, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 25, 508-24 (1986)), Heck (R. F. Heck, Org. React.,<br><br>
27, 345-90 (1982)), Sonogashira, (K. Sonogashira, Synthesis, 777 (1977)), Buckwald (S.L. Buckwald, Ace. Chem. Re., 3J_, 805 (1998)), from the corresponding halogenated deR1vatives.<br>
For this, it is necessary to protect the reactive functional groups. Thus, the OH, SH, COOH and NH2 functional groups must be protected before carrying out the coupling. The protective groups are introduced according to any method known to a person skilled in the art and in particular those descR1bed by T.W. Greene, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-Interscience Publication (1999). It is preferable to protect the nitrogen in the 1-position with groups such as tert-butoxycarbonyl or 1 silicon deR1vatives. The choice will preferably be made of a tert-butyldimefhylsilyl or tR1isopropylsilyl silyl group which can be removed by fluoR1de anions or with acetic acid and more particularly a tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl group which can be cleaved by tetrabutylammonium fluoR1de at reflux in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane (J. P. Whitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891 (1986); B. H. Lipshutz, Tetrahedron Lett., 4095 (1986)) or by 2N hydrochloR1c acid in methanol or ethanol at reflux.<br>
The deR1vatives protected in the 1-position with tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl are obtained by reacting the starting compound with tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl chloR1de in the presence of sodium hydR1de in a solvent, such as dimethylformamide, at ambient temperature (J. P. Whitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891 (1986); M. P. Edwards, 1     Tetrahedron, 42, 3723 (1986)).<br>
Likewise, the 1-NH nitrogen functional group of the indazole will be protected by groups such as silyl deR1vatives, benzyl, carbamate or tosyl. For example, in the case where it would be desired to carry out coupling with palladium to a deR1vative halogenated in the 6-position, it will be necessary to protect the nitrogen in the 1-<br><br><br>
Deprotection is carR1ed out according to methods known to a person skilled in the art and descR1bed by T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-Interscience Publication (1999). For example, if the protective group in the 1-position is   a   tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl,    it   can   be   deprotected   by   reaction   with<br><br>
When one of the R5 or R6 groups involved in the coupling using the chemistry of palladium itself compR1ses a reactive functional group, such as hydroxyl, amine, thiol or acid or generally includes a heteroatom, it is also necessary to protect the latter before carrying out the coupling with palladium. Thus, for example, a phenol functional group will be introduced in the protected form (O-benzyl, for example) from the chloR1nated deR1vative, the nitrogen in the 1-position being protected as<br><br>
The benzyl group will subsequently be removed, for example by treatment with tR1methylsilyl iodide at reflux in acetonitR1le. Protection can also be carR1ed out by a tR1methylsilylethoxymethyl group which can be cleaved by tetrabutylammonium fluoR1de at reflux in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. (J. P. Whitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891 (1986); B. H. Lipshutz, Tetrahedron Lett., 4095 (1986)) or by 2N hydrochloR1c acid in methanol or ethanol at reflux.<br><br>
When R5 and R6 are, independently of one another, an aryl and a halogen, the aryl functional group is introduced from coupling with palladium to a brominated position, the nitrogen in the 1- and 3-positions being appropR1ately protected. Preferably, Pr represents a tR1rnethylsilylethoxymethyl and Pr" represents an n-butylcarbonyl group which forms, with the nitrogen, an n-butylamide. The stage of deprotecting the amide is carR1ed out in the presence of ethanolamine at reflux for one week in DMF. This cleavage can also be carR1ed out with stannous chloR1de in ethanol (R J GR1ffin, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1992, 1811-1819) or else sodium methoxide in methanol (Y. Furukawa, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1968,16, 1076) or any other alkoxide in<br><br>
The compounds of formula (II) are the starting point for the preparation of a great vaR1ety of products obtained by reaction of the pR1mary amine functional group of the 3-aminoindazole in all the conventional reactions of this functional group, such as: alkylation, acylation, reactions with carbonyl deR1vatives followed by reduction, sulfonation, conversion to ureas or carbamates, arylation (Castro reaction or Buchwald reaction), and the like.<br>

Condensations with deR1vatives general formula (I) where R3 is H with isocyanates of type OCNR1 can be carR1ed out in particular in tetrahydrofuran and according to the examples descR1bed in Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations, Vol. 6 (KatR1tzky, Meth-Cohn, Rees 1995), to form products where R3 is CONR1R2 and Rl and R2 are, independently of one another, a hydrogen, (l-6C)alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl or heteroaryl, themselves optionally being substituted by 1 or more substituents chosen from halogen, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, CN, NO2, NH2, OH, COOH, COOalkyl, CONH2, formyl, tR1fluoromethyl or tR1fluoromethoxy.<br>
Sulfonations of deR1vatives of general formula (I) where R3 is H can be carR1ed out from a sulfonyl chloR1de of Rl SO2CI type in the presence of a base (in particular tertiary amines, such as tR1ethylamine, or aromatic amines, such as pyR1dine) in a conventional solvent, such as, for example, dichloromethane, to form the products where R3 is SO2R1 and Rl is a hydrogen, (l-6C)alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl or heteroaryl, themselves optionally being substituted by 1 or more substituents chosen from halogen, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, CN, N02, NH2, OH, COOH, COOalkyl, CONH2, formyl, tR1fluoromethyl or tR1fluoromethoxy.<br>

Cortex sections with a thickness of 300|j.m are prepared from male OFA rats (Iffa-Credo) aged 8-10 weeks, sacR1ficed by decapitation. They are incubated in 5 ml of DMEM medium compR1sing pyruvate and glucose 4.5 g/1 at 37°C for 40 min. The sections are subsequently washed twice with the medium, distR1buted in microtubes (50μl in 500μl of medium, with or without test compounds) and incubated at 37°C with stirR1ng. Two hours later, the expeR1ment is halted by centR1fuging. The sections are lyzed, sonicated and centR1fuged at 18300g for 15 min at 4°C. The concentration of proteins in the supernatant is determined by a commercial assay (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce) based on the Lowry method.<br>
The samples, denatured beforehand at 70°C for 10 min, are separated on 4-12% Bis-tR1s vertical gel in the presence of MOPS-SDS buffer and are electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunolabeling is carR1ed out with the monoclonal antibody AD2, which specifically recognizes the Ser3 96/404 phosphorylated epitopes of the tau protein. The immunoreactive proteins are visualized by addition of a second antibody directed against mouse IgGs and coupled to peroxidase and of a chemoluminescent substrate. The autoradiograms obtained are finally quantified using the "GeneTools" software from Syngene (GeneGnome, Ozyme) to determine an IC50 value.<br>
