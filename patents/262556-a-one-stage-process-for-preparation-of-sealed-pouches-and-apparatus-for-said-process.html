FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the forming, filling and sealing of<br>
pouch products, such as reservoir transdermal patches, and to suitable apparatus for<br>
carrying out such processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transdermal patches generally take one of two forms; matrix or reservoir.<br>
Matrix patches generally consist of an impermeable backing material having an<br>
adhesive on one side, and wherein the adhesive also contains the active substance for<br>
transdermal administration. Once the patch has been applied to the skin, the active<br>
substance leaches from the adhesive into the skin. However, such patches suffer from<br>
the dual problems of loading sufficient active substance into the adhesive, and<br>
subsequent high levels of retention of the active substance in the adhesive, rather than<br>
leaching out into the skin.<br>
By contrast, reservoir patches have a reservoir of active substance formed<br>
between the impermeable backing material and the adhesive, which merely needs to<br>
allow passage of the substance. Problems with low loading and high retention are not<br>
generally encountered. Typically, these patches are illustrated by Indian Patent No.<br>
172748 (EP-A-336543).<br>
Reservoir construction manufacturing processes do not affect the technical<br>
performance of the finished product in the same way that drug-in-adhesive<br>
manufacturing processes do. Several elements of the drug-in-adhesive manufacturing<br>
process can cause significant inter and intra-batch load variabilities in the active drug<br>
content, and can lead to significant variability in a wide range of in vitro performance<br>
characteristics. Causal factors include: curing of the adhesive at temperature;<br>
component dimensions; and, homogeneity of the active-drug matrix.<br>
Volatile or toxic substances, such as nicotine and fentanyl, require minimal<br>
product loss during manufacture and shelf life, if they are to remain efficacious and safe<br><br>
under the recommended terms of use. and active loading contents at manufacture should<br>
substantially correspond with the loading contents when administered.<br>
The processes for the production of reservoir patch, or pouch type, constructions<br>
yield significantly better intra and inter-batch results. These processes are also often<br>
better suited to volatile or toxic active compounds, as they encapsulate the active at the<br>
point of manufacture, and only release the majority of their load when administered to<br>
the patient. Within reservoir type manufacturing processes, it is recognised that<br>
continuous motion processes can provide significant benefits over intermittent<br>
processes, in that the continuous processes require fewer moving parts. Wear is greater<br>
on intermittent processes and cutter-life is shorter, so less maintenance and often lower<br>
component replacement costs arise with continuous processes. They also generate a<br>
higher component material yield than intermittent processes and are, therefore, more<br>
desirable to operate for volume production.<br>
WO 99/52513 discloses a patch manufacturing process which is continuous and<br>
which generates a low component materials waste level. The process is a form-fill-seal<br>
process that may be in either the vertical or horizontal plane and incorporates flexibility<br>
of tooling, allowing a range of patch sizes to be manufactured. The process uses a<br>
plurality of opposing rollers in the vertical plane to create the vertical seals across a<br>
series of lanes, such that there is always one more vertical roller than there are lanes.<br>
Two opposing horizontal double edged jaws, whose length extends to cover the total<br>
width of the number of lanes, create the horizontal seal. The process enables the<br>
machine capacity to be expanded, by increasing the number of lanes, as required, with<br>
minimal additional tooling.<br>
While this process allows versatility for the development of different sized<br>
products for pilot scale or early commercial scale production volumes, there are several<br>
key restrictions to this technology.<br>
1. The patches that are created are square or rectangular and have angular corners.<br>
The cosmetic appearance cannot be changed automatically in-line or within this process,<br><br>
necessitating a subsequent die-cut function at a separate station, post assembly, which<br>
would require bandoliering the resultant web, as well as a print registration process to<br>
synchronise the web with the die-cut stations.<br>
2.	Primary packaging is a laborious process. For small volumes this can be done<br>
off-line with semi-automatic equipment, manually filling pre-formed pouches with the<br>
individual patches. This results in a significant work in process production bottleneck<br>
and large unit costs. For larger volumes, an automatic process can be used to pouch the<br>
patches, employing a separate machine post assembly with a 'pick &amp; feed' or similar<br>
placement mechanism. This function tends to have a lower cycle speed, resulting in a<br>
production bottleneck, as well as generating additional costs, and there is a risk of<br>
damaging the patches when selecting them for packaging.<br>
3.	It is not possible to incorporate a tear-tab into the patch during primary<br>
production. Transdermal products include this characteristic in their specification.<br>
Examples include a separation mechanism achieved by placing the patch on a larger<br>
piece of material which can be removed from the patch relatively easily, or<br>
incorporating a 'crack &amp; peel', 'butterfly' or similar effect, integrated within the release<br>
liner, so that the patch may be separated from the release liner prior to application.<br>
Such effects can contribute to increased product losses over time, so that it is generally<br>
preferable to ensure that the integrity of the release liner is maintained across the entire<br>
active surface area of the patch. This can be achieved by providing a kiss-cut across<br>
one or more corners of the patch individually, or on the web as a whole, at a subsequent<br>
station to the primary process. Again, this requires product registration to maintain<br>
synchronisation, and suffers from similar drawbacks to those associated with secondary<br>
pouching.<br>
4.	The process disclosed in WO 99/52513 is dependent on the contact surface grip<br>
between the horizontal jaws and vertical rollers to drive the materials through the<br>
process, as there is no independent web drive unit. In order to maintain constant<br>
pressure and prevent slippage, these surfaces are etched with a pattern, the specification<br>
of which is determined by the materials in use. This results in an obvious pattern within<br><br>
the seal which may not be cosmetically desirable. The level of pressure control that can<br>
be applied to the vertical rollers and horizontal jaws is limited, without either damaging<br>
the web materials or reducing drive friction. If these pressures are reduced too much, or<br>
rollers without any surface etching are used, the ability to maintain constant web<br>
friction is reduced, on the one hand, or damage to the appearance of the material can<br>
occur, on the other. Both are commercially undesirable and can affect technical<br>
performance of the product.<br>
5.	More significantly, by the very nature of the technique, the web can wander<br>
throughout the entire process. Whilst the effect can be minimised by ensuring the<br>
supply reels are of consistent quality and the sealing rollers are linearly aligned,<br>
inconsistencies in the reel specifications can create wander that has to be accommodated<br>
within the sealing and cutting process. This results in finished products which can vary<br>
in size, depending on the aforementioned variables. As a consequence, non-destructive<br>
sampling e.g. by weight, is not reliable, and all sampling is necessarily destructive.<br>
6.	While the process allows flexibility in selecting patch size, loading contents,<br>
machine throughputs and supply reel specifications, this flexibility can be detrimental in<br>
large scale manufacture, owing to the human error introduced thereby. In addition, both<br>
intra- and inter-batch variations can occur, according to machine or reel conditions at<br>
the time.<br>
7.	The degree of control that can be applied to, or measured at, the surface of the<br>
rollers or jaws is restricted, so that the provision of drive to the web materials can only<br>
be achieved if patterns are etched onto the sealing area.<br>
8.	Embossing or debossing of any delicate forms is extremely difficult and can<br>
only be achieved in cooperation with print registration or off-line.<br>
9.	Trimming of the patch or pouch edges to coincide with the edge of the seal is<br>
intrinsically difficult to synchronise. Excessive web wander can cause yield levels to<br>
reduce, and lead to inconsistent quality of the finished product.<br><br>
The process disclosed in US-A-4,614,076 provides twin mono-blocks to create<br>
and seal the patches before cutting. The subsequent vertical cutting process separates<br>
the web into a plurality of vertical, parallel lanes prior to the transverse cutting station.<br>
Both cutting processes are separate from, and subsequent to, the sealing station. In<br>
order to synchronise location of finished product and to minimise inaccurate cutting,<br>
separate friction rolls are introduced between the sealing and cutting stations. As with<br>
WO 99/52513, the cutting process described is only capable of generating square or<br>
rectangular patches. The illustrated shaped patch can only be achieved by a separate<br>
die-cutting station, as discussed above. In addition, the degassing is such that a risk<br>
exists of the liquid escaping into the seal area.<br>
Neither of the processes disclosed in US-A-4,614,076 and WO 99/52513 is<br>
capable of providing in-line sampling, without gaining access within the 'guarding' of<br>
the machinery, thereby leading to loss of significant volumes of finished product. All<br>
sampling is destructive. In-line reject management cannot be achieved without losing<br>
significant volumes of finished product. Primary packaging must be carried out off-line<br>
on a separate piece of machinery, and the de-gassing can lead to higher rejection rates.<br>
Other processes are disclosed in US-A-4,845,926, US-A-4,004,399,<br>
US-A-3,210,908, FR-A-1,068,961 and US-A-4,769,974, but do not employ mono-block<br>
processes, so are liable to finished product specification variances. All except<br>
US-A-4,845,926 create large reservoir bellies, and neither US-A-3,210,908 nor<br>
US-A-4,769,974 are of a continuous process nature, resulting in dosing at an interphase,<br>
causing larger reservoir bellies.<br>
Indian Patent No. 177265 (WO 90/13487) discloses a process for manufacturing<br>
infusion packages, such as teabags. Piles of tea are dosed onto a horizontal web, which<br>
is drawn through a first sealing station and a second cutting station, before the bags are<br>
punched into receptacles. The tension in the web can lead to inaccuracies, and the<br>
process is not suitable for liquids.<br><br>
A similar process, but where pairs of bags are interconnected by a tab, is<br>
disclosed in GB-A-2314312.<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found that it is possible to provide the solution to<br>
many, if not all, of the above identified problems, by the use of a die-cutting<br>
monoblock.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, there is provided a one stage process for the preparation<br>
of sealed pouches, comprising:<br>
a first step of passing a plurality of webs between a first pair of cooperating,<br>
sealing rollers, at least one of the rollers having one or more forms thereon serving to<br>
define a pouch seal in cooperation with the second roller when the webs are passed<br>
therebetween;<br>
a second step of passing the resulting sealed pouches between a second set of<br>
cooperating, cutting rollers, wherein one or more dies on at least one of the rollers serve<br>
to cut and sever the pouches from the skeleton of web material,<br>
and wherein the second set of rollers is in register with the first set of rollers.<br>
Pouches produced in accordance with the present invention are preferably<br>
produced in transdermal dosage form, oral dosage form, or implantable dosage form.<br>
The processes of the art involve multiple cutting stations, serving to cut the web<br>
lengthways and crosswise. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide a shaped pouch<br>
other than by employing a further, die-cutting process. For example, the shaped pouch<br>
illustrated in US-A-4,614,076 cannot actually be produced by the cutting means<br>
illustrated in the patent. Although the forms on the first roller described therein may<br>
take any shape, the slitting rollers and the cutting station only permit the production of<br>
regular rectangles. In addition, the extra friction rollers and the existence of more than<br>
one cutting station introduces scope for error.<br><br>
The process of the present invention is a one stage process, by which is meant<br>
that the various rollers of the invention are located in one station, with the sealed webs<br>
passing directly from one set of rollers to the next.<br>
Thus, in a simple embodiment, the present invention provides a one stage<br>
process for the preparation of reservoir patches, and comprises feeding webs to a first<br>
pair of sealing rollers and, thence, directly to a second pair of die-cutting rollers, and<br>
preferably directly into a packaging step, thereby avoiding most operator-related error,<br>
and substantially increasing overall sterility and reproducibility.<br>
While it is possible for there to be provided supporting means, such as support<br>
rollers, between the two sets of rollers, it will generally be the case that no such support<br>
is required, as it is preferred to minimise the distance between the paired roller<br>
interfaces. The interfaces between the paired rollers may be at angles, such as to<br>
tension the web, although this is not generally preferred.<br>
More generally, it is generally preferred to feed two webs to the first pair of<br>
rollers, with one web providing a backing material, generally impervious to the contents<br>
of the pouch, and the other web providing either a similar, or identical, backing material<br>
or, more preferably, a material having a desired set of properties.<br>
The web having the additional properties may consist of one or more layers, and<br>
these layers may be fed, independently, into the apparatus of the invention, being sealed<br>
into laminate form on passing through the first set of rollers.<br>
More preferably, the web is provided as a laminate so that, in the case of a<br>
reservoir patch, for example, this laminate may comprise an optional porous webbing,<br>
an adhesive and a release layer, which may be sealed, via the webbing, to the backing<br>
layer, on passing through the sealing rollers.<br>
There is no need for calendaring, or otherwise embossing, the sheets of web<br>
material, as the sheets are sealed together at the first set of rollers, and pass without<br><br>
interruption into the second pair of rollers to be cut. Thus, there is generally no need to<br>
either grip or tension the skeleton containing the sealed pouches.<br>
The sheets of web material are suitably provided on large rolls, and can be fed<br>
direct to the paired rollers. Laminated web material can be expensive and, as such, it<br>
may be preferred to split the sheet as it comes off the roll, in order to feed it direct to the<br>
forms on the first set of rollers, thereby to minimise waste between adjacent forms.<br>
Where there are large numbers of forms, or the forms are small, for example, it<br>
may be preferable to provide strips of web material embracing two, three or four, but<br>
preferably two, forms, for ease of handling.<br>
It will also be appreciated that it is not generally necessary to provide the<br>
backing material in such strip form, as the backing material is generally more<br>
economical to produce than the laminate and that, in addition, providing a single sheet<br>
of backing material also lends stability to the skeleton containing the pouches after<br>
passing through the first set of rollers.<br>
In general, the webs may be supplied to the first pair of rollers in a conventional<br>
manner, such as is illustrated in W099/52513.<br>
Before sealing the pouches, any contents need to be positioned therein. In the<br>
event that the contents of the pouches are gaseous, then it may be sufficient simply to<br>
target a jet of the gas, or gaseous mixture, into the form for the pouch, in order to<br>
distend a belly, which is then sealed as the rollers continue to form the pouch. A similar<br>
technique may be employed for liquids or powders, whilst solids or gels, and other<br>
preparations capable of maintaining their form for at least a limited period, can be<br>
deposited on one or other web, or less preferably both, in register with the pouch<br>
forming function of the first pair of rollers. Such pouch contents may, in themselves,<br>
for example, be in capsule form, or the web upon which they are deposited may have a<br>
series of discretely formed adhesive patches, or overall adhesive layer, upon which the<br>
pouch contents may be deposited, in order to secure them to the web prior to sealing the<br>
incipient pouch.<br><br>
It is a particular advantage of the present invention that it is possible to produce<br>
reservoir patches with minimal bellies. While pockets and other forms of recess are<br>
discussed herein, which are intended to accommodate such bellies, it will be appreciated<br>
that the bellies may range from the virtually negligible to the substantial, depending on<br>
the intended contents of the pouch. A highly active drug that may be contained at high<br>
concentrations in a gel may only require a pouch thickness in the order of a millimetre<br>
or less, while a pouch adapted to contain insect larvae may need to be an order of<br>
magnitude, or more, greater, for example.<br>
Other suitable forms of pouch contents include drug solutions, such as aqueous<br>
gels of nicotine, suitably thickened, to permit deposition onto the web and minimal<br>
spreading prior to pouch formation.<br>
On passing between the first pair of sealing rollers, the web materials are<br>
conjoined, with integral seals defining discrete pouches being formed on passage<br>
between the rollers.<br>
In one embodiment, one of the rollers may simply be plain, whilst the opposing<br>
roller has one or more raised shapes about its periphery to encompass the volume of the<br>
pouch, and wherein the raised walls define the seal. These raised walls may extend as<br>
far as is desired towards an adjacent form, for example, in which case the area to receive<br>
the belly of the pouch may instead be considered to be a pocket in the roller.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, pockets are provided in both rollers to<br>
accommodate the belly of the pouch.<br>
It will also be appreciated that all or part of the area on one or both of the rollers<br>
defining the seal may be ridged or dimpled in order to assist in seal formation and/or<br>
gripping the web(s).<br>
The seal itself may simply be formed by pressure, or may be effected by<br>
pressure sensitive or contact adhesive. More preferably, the seal is generated by the<br>
effect of heat, so that a combination of pressure and heat may serve to weld plastics<br><br>
components of the two webs together, for example, or to secure the two webs together<br>
via a heat activatable adhesive.<br>
After passing through the first pair or rollers, the conjoined web may be<br>
considered to be a skeleton containing discrete, sealed pouches. The seals may be<br>
localised to the individual pouches, or may continue between pouches. In one<br>
embodiment, the seals are continuous between pouches in a lengthwise direction<br>
relative to the direction of travel.<br>
The skeleton then passes between the second set of rollers. The second set of<br>
rollers is in registration with the first set of rollers, and preferably shares the same drive<br>
as the first set of rollers.<br>
Registration may be effected by any suitable means known in the art, and is<br>
preferably effected mechanically, such as by a suitable gear train. In one embodiment, a<br>
contra-rotating roller is positioned in contact with a roller from each of the two pairs of<br>
rollers of the invention, and registration can be ensured by meshing matched teeth on<br>
the rollers. This can serve to ensure exact registration of sealing and subsequent cutting<br>
as, if the cutting rollers are not in exact registration with the sealing rollers, then<br>
meshing with the contra-rotating roller is impeded, and suitable restorative action can be<br>
taken.<br>
As with the first pair of rollers, one of the second pair of rollers can be plain,<br>
with a cutting pattern on the other roller serving to cut through the web against the plain<br>
roller. Also as before, the second roller may have pockets to accommodate the pouch,<br>
so as not to force the skeleton away from the roller and to lead to any inaccuracy in<br>
cutting of the pouch. Such pockets may be generated by raising walls, with peripheries<br>
or flanges on the walls serving as cutting surfaces against which the template cutting<br>
edges of the opposing roller can act. A pocket within the cutting template is preferably<br>
provided, to accommodate the belly of the pouch.<br>
It is not necessary, nor particularly desirable, that the pockets on either roller<br>
serve to engage the pouch. Instead, it is desirable that the pouch pass between the<br><br>
rollers without any significant interaction therewith, other than to be cut and separate<br>
the pouch from the skeleton.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the path between the two pairs of rollers<br>
is substantially vertical, such that the skeleton drops from the first pair of rollers into<br>
engagement with the second pair of rollers. By "substantially vertical" is meant that the<br>
process proceeds in the direction of gravity and that, if desired, the effects of gravity can<br>
be used assist the process. In this regard, an angle of 45° from the horizontal is the<br>
minimum angle, and is more preferably at least 80°, more preferably 85°, and is<br>
particularly preferably 90° ±1°. Completely vertical is most preferred, in many<br>
circumstances, within tolerance.<br>
In such an embodiment, the contents of the pouch may be dropped, or dispensed,<br>
into the part-formed pouch, prior to completion of the seal, as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying Figure 1, for example. Suitable dropping or dispensing means may be<br>
employed. Where the contents are free flowing, flow control and/or metering means are<br>
preferably associated with the dropping or dispensing means. It will be appreciated that<br>
such means may also be associated with contents dispensing means in other aspects of<br>
the invention.<br>
This embodiment can be especially efficient with flowing contents, such as<br>
powders and liquids, as the pouch remains open with the opening facing upwards, while<br>
the webs are fed in over the rollers, until the final sealing, and the dose can be metered<br>
such that the pouch fills as it is formed. In this way, there is little danger of spillage,<br>
while the pouch is capable of being filled, substantially completely, without there being<br>
an excess of air that is trapped or that needs to be expelled in some form.<br>
It will also be appreciated that it is possible to employ other angles, including<br>
the complete opposite, whereby the skeleton passes upwards from the first pair of<br>
rollers, but this will generally entail guiding means, where the pathway is below the<br>
horizontal, or not much above, and may even necessitate friction rollers where the<br><br>
pathway is much above horizontal. It is particularly preferred to avoid having to use the<br>
former and more particularly preferred to avoid the necessity for the latter.<br>
After passing through the second pair of rollers, the skeleton may be drawn<br>
away, for further use or disposal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, materials waste levels are no greater than 30%, after<br>
cutting.<br>
In order to ensure separation of the pouches from the skeleton, either because the<br>
pouches were kiss-cut, or simply to ensure the efficacy of the cutting operation, punches<br>
may be employed to separate the pouches from the web skeleton.<br>
The nature of such punches, where employed, is not critical to the present<br>
invention, but may take the form, for example, of a punch being temporarily extruded<br>
from one of the rollers against the direction that the web is being removed, thereby to<br>
create tension between the pouch and the skeleton, if there is any remaining contact<br>
between the pouch and skeleton.<br>
Such punch means within the roller can be provided by the use of a suitable<br>
cam, for example.<br>
The punch means, where provided, may be provided in either roller, and will<br>
generally correspond to at least 40 percent of the surface area of one side of the pouch<br>
formed by the cutter. Preferably, the punch face area corresponds to up to 90 percent,<br>
or more, of the pouch surface area.<br>
It has been particularly surprisingly found that the whole process of pouch<br>
manufacture can be dramatically simplified by the incorporation of a primary packaging<br>
operation after the forming of the pouches, so that, as the pouches are formed, they are<br>
dispensed directly into a partially preformed container, or outer pouch, which can then<br>
be sealed or closed immediately upon receipt of the pouch. This is especially beneficial<br><br>
where it is desired to maintain sterile, or substantially sterile conditions, or where the<br>
pouch is fragile, and benefits from lack of further handling.<br>
Thus, in a preferred aspect, the present invention provides a process as defined<br>
above, further characterised in that the one stage process comprises a third step whereby<br>
severed pouches released from the second pair of rollers are captured and secured into<br>
outer, or primary, pouches. In this context, "one stage" indicates an uninterrupted, or<br>
continuous, process, in that the pouches are not, for example, removed and stored before<br>
packaging. In particular, it is envisaged that the pouches are dispensed into the outer<br>
pouches as they are separated from the skeleton, or web.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the outer pouches are prepared by drawing together<br>
suitable sheets of retaining material so as to entrain the severed pouches.<br>
Where the pouches are dropped into partially preformed outer pouches, then this<br>
may be effected by suitable sealing rollers defining a continuous outer seal on either<br>
side of the pouch, and preferably leaving clearance between the pouch and the seal. The<br>
size of the clearance is not critical to the present invention, but is preferably at least 3 -<br>
5mm.<br>
After lengthwise sealing, transverse sealing jaws serve to create the third of the<br>
four seals of the outer pouch and, once at least one severed pouch is located within the<br>
outer pouch area, progression of the retaining material sheets through the apparatus will<br>
then result in a closed outer pouch when the sealing jaws seal the pouch and create the<br>
third of the four seals for the subsequent pouch.<br>
It will be appreciated that the apparatus to form the outer pouch may be adapted<br>
in any suitable manner, and that, for example, self-adhesive pouch walls may be<br>
dispensed from release webs to surround the severed pouches.<br>
In another embodiment, the severed pouches may be dispensed on to a sheet of<br>
material that is to form a part of the outer pouch, and wherein the sheet of material is<br>
angled away from the vertical such that the severed pouch remains in place. This<br><br>
embodiment is useful, for example, where punches are used to separate the pouches<br>
from the skeleton. The outer pouches may then be formed by the addition of a second<br>
wall, which may either be continuous or discontinuous, the outer pouches then being<br>
severed at a subsequent cutting station.<br>
In preparing the outer pouches, the decoration for these pouches may be added<br>
before or after the severed pouches are incorporated, although it is generally preferred to<br>
provide the decoration, such as printing, embossing, or Braille, beforehand, in order to<br>
avoid unnecessary pressure on the incorporated pouch.<br>
It is a particular advantage of the present invention that it is possible to locate all<br>
of the steps of the process within one cycle of each other and preferably within no more<br>
than three cycles of each other. In this respect, one cycle corresponds to the maximum<br>
circumference of either of the form and cutting rollers.<br>
It is also possible to incorporate tear tabs into the process of the invention, this<br>
being readily incorporated into the cutting templates in the second pair of rollers. A<br>
nick at the periphery of the pouch provides a ready tear, whilst a nick within the seal<br>
area provides a childproof tear area where the seal area must first be bent over before<br>
tearing at the nick.<br>
Also, as illustrated in Figure 3, for example, the seal area may not extend as far<br>
as the cutting area, so that it is possible to pull the two webs apart to reveal the contents<br>
of the pouch.<br>
It is an advantage of the process of the present invention that there can be<br>
provided a continuous, fully integrated, manufacturing process for patches or pouches<br>
containing an active ingredient, supported within either a liquid or dry powder, that<br>
generates low levels of component material waste.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pouches are created from two series of twin<br>
monoblocks of opposite natures, one male and one female, such that the first two<br>
opposing surfaces create a seal, and the second two opposing surfaces cut the shape of<br><br>
the finished product simultaneously. The sizes of such pouches may generally vary<br>
from a minimal size of, say, approximately 2.5cm to a maximum size equivalent to the<br>
surface are of the mono-block circumferential surface area.<br>
A high degree of pressure control is possible between the mono-blocks, thereby<br>
providing improved sealing and cutting quality, and the prevention of over-pressure or<br>
damage to component materials, as well as enabling an integrated drive for the web<br>
materials to be achieved with less moving parts and fewer separate stations than the art.<br>
It is a particular advantage of the present invention that the process is capable of<br>
providing shaped, finished products, with fewer separate functions in the process.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that inter-batch and intra-batch<br>
variability is minimised, and consistency and repeatability of the finished product<br>
quality is enhanced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a fully<br>
integrated, in-line, primary packaging process. This can enable maintenance of<br>
atmospheric control in one unit for the whole process, and minimises non-sterile<br>
exposure or the necessity for handling. This may be further enhanced by the provision<br>
of a fully integrated facility for in-line primary packaging.<br>
It is a further advantage that effective in-line reject and sampling management<br>
can be provided in a non-destructive fashion. For example, monitors may detect the<br>
edges of the webs and/or detect the extent of spread of filling substance, while success<br>
of cutting the pouches from the skeleton may be also be monitored, as can numerous<br>
other parameters readily apparent to those skilled in the art. An arm located in<br>
proximity to the cutting rollers and situated therebelow will generally suffice to clear a<br>
row of reject pouches, with the primary packaging apparatus readily halted while the<br>
row is rejected, thereby to prevent wastage of primary packaging.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shape of the finished<br>
pouch or patch within the web is defined at the same time as the sealing process is<br><br>
conducted, without any need for any subsequent offline or separate function to improve<br>
the aesthetics of the finished product. Rounded corners, or other such shapes, can be<br>
incorporated at this stage. The two series of mono-blocks are synchronised to ensure<br>
the cut occurs at the desired location, and eliminates the need for print registration. This<br>
integrated function reduces the cost of labour for the finished product by incorporating<br>
an in-line shaping process that has previously only been available, offline, as a separate<br>
function.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the integrated cutting mechanism within the<br>
second series of mono-block sealing tools limits the waste level of materials between<br>
individual pouches to that area outside of the seals of each pouch, thereby leading to a<br>
more consistent level of component material yield, irrespective of reel or machine<br>
conditions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, pre-calibrated standards are pre-set<br>
to measure and monitor effective loading of the patches or pouches, and to reject<br>
product if one of the conditions does not match. Since the primary packaging is<br>
supplied 'on-demand' in reaction to confirmed loading of the patches or pouches, a<br>
reject does not generate an empty primary pack, thus minimising wastage. Similarly,<br>
reel change splices or run-outs can be identified, so that any rejected product is isolated,<br>
without affecting machine running speeds, thereby minimising wastage levels and<br>
increasing finished product yield levels.<br>
With the present invention, in-line sampling can be achieved without<br>
necessitating access to the 'guarded' area of the machine, and without interrupting flow.<br>
Due to consistent web placement and tighter tolerances, non-destructive sampling, such<br>
as check-weighing, can be employed.<br>
Overprinting, in-line, is possible, without print registration, thereby allowing<br>
improved inventory management. Auto-insertion can be incorporated in-line at either<br>
the primary or secondary stage thus improving productivity.<br><br>
In addition, by the nature of the integrated packing process, packs are readily<br>
rendered tamper-evident. In the preferred process of the invention, the primary packing<br>
is inherently tamper-evident, as the primary packing is sealed, and a broken seal is<br>
evidence of tampering. No tampering is possible during the process of the invention,<br>
without stopping the machinery, as the whole process is continuous and integral.<br>
The continuous, integral and generally compact nature of the process of the<br>
invention enables the whole process to be carried out under a sterile, or clean,<br>
atmosphere, such as by flushing with nitrogen. Where the entire process is not<br>
hermetically sealed, it may be desirable to flush stages, such as filling, with clean, or<br>
sterile, gas. This process is referred to as degassing, in the art, and also covers<br>
evacuating the product. In the process of the invention, effective de-gassing may be<br>
achieved of both inner (patch or pouch) and outer primary (packaging) bags, in-line.<br>
In preferred embodiments of this invention, overall component material<br>
utilisation, or yield level, exceeds 70% of the total size of the pouch.<br>
Owing to the compactness and inherent lack of error of the process of the<br>
present invention, speeds in excess of the art (which typically run at up to 40<br>
cycles/minute) are possible. Indeed, machine capacity is based on levels of 50 cycles/<br>
minute or higher and may be increased by increasing cycle speed or according to the<br>
width of the mono-block cylinder and the number of lanes across the width, based on a<br>
standard size of patch or pouch reservoir.<br>
Machine capacity may be adjusted in relation to the mono-block cylinders<br>
according to the size and number of patches or pouches produced per mono-block cycle.<br>
Each patch or pouch size is defined by the corresponding mono-block, such that each<br>
patch or pouch specification has its own dedicated mono-blocks for both sealing and<br>
cutting. Patch or sachet size variations are achieved by replacing both sets of mono-<br>
blocks as change parts for the same machine, which helps reduce product<br>
inconsistencies intra- and inter-batch. Each different set of mono-blocks may require<br>
unique supply reel web widths.<br><br>
The 'bag-in-bag' process, or primary packaging, is preferably provided as an<br>
integrated function of the process, without any subsequent offline or separate function.<br>
This integrated function occurs in synchrony with the primary assembly process,<br>
thereby eliminating any work in progress, as a result of incorporating at least two<br>
separate processes into a single in-line function. Furthermore, product can be singled<br>
out and prepared for presentation to either primary or secondary packaging, and wherein<br>
the latter may also be introduced as an in-line function to eliminate any further work in<br>
progress.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a void is incorporated within the seal on both mono-<br>
blocks, so that part of the intended sealing area remains unsealed, thereby creating an<br>
integrated tear-tab within the seal. This allows the complete release liner to be peeled<br>
away from the bulk of the pouch or sachet to allow the user to separate the component<br>
materials with ease. This void does not affect the integrity of the seal, and does not<br>
cause any significant increase in product losses during storage.<br>
It is advantageous that differential temperature controls are possible for each<br>
opposing mono-block, so as to be able to optimise sealing conditions for component<br>
materials.<br>
Since both series of twin mono-blocks contribute to applying pressure that can<br>
be both controlled and monitored to provide consistent friction on the web, another<br>
advantage of the process of the present invention is that continuous motion can be<br>
maintained at consistent and constant pressure between both series of mono-blocks,<br>
which can be carefully controlled, monitored, and adjusted, to reflect the product<br>
specification requirements, without materially affecting the physical nature of the patch<br>
or pouch. It also allows a wider range of seal appearances to be applied to the seal<br>
surface without any loss of yield or machine throughput.<br>
Given the ability to control the pressure applied at either, or all, of the primary<br>
or secondary mono-block or a subsequent station, delicate patterns may be embossed or<br><br>
de-bossed into the packaging material. Such patterns include logos or words as a<br>
labelling message for the consumer and may also include Braille.<br>
It is advantageous that the number of operator variables are relatively few, such<br>
that the finished product specification is more consistent, and both the product and<br>
process can therefore be validated to higher pharmaceutical and cGMP regulatory<br>
standards.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to any product<br>
dispensable as a pouch, such as patches or pouches that essentially resemble miniature<br>
transdermal patches, for example, but that do not include an adhesive layer, a release<br>
liner or impermeable backing material. One such formulation may be sealed between<br>
two outer layers of membrane selected to allow controlled release of the formulation,<br>
and the resulting product used as an oral dosage form or implant, for example.<br>
In another embodiment, patches or pouches comprise only backing material and<br>
removable release liner to reveal a skeleton web, through which the contents of the<br>
pouch, such as insect larvae, may pass freely. The adhesive layer is suitably limited to<br>
that area around the perimeter of the pouch or across the skeleton web. Alternatively,<br>
there may be no adhesive, and the pouch is adapted to be retained in situ by a breathable<br>
bandage, for example. The outer layers of material may, thus, serve merely to restrain<br>
the contents, rather than prevent intrusion.. The resulting product may be used as a<br>
mechanism to sort and transport live contents, such as larvae, and to provide<br>
containment when applied to a distal surface, such as a wound.<br>
Self-diagnostics may be incorporated in to the apparatus of the invention in<br>
order to minimise machinery downtime and to assist in identifying any faults.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention further provides apparatus<br>
suitable for use with a process as defined above, comprising a first pair of cooperating,<br>
sealing rollers, and means to feed a plurality of webs thereto, at least one of the rollers<br>
having one or more forms thereon serving to define a pouch seal in cooperation with the<br>
second roller when webs are passed therebetween, and a second set of cooperating,<br><br>
cutting rollers, wherein one or more dies on at least one of the rollers are suitable to cut<br>
and sever pouches generated by the first pair of rollers from the web material, wherein<br>
the second set of rollers is in register with the first set of rollers.<br>
It is preferred that one roller of the first pair has one or more raised forms<br>
thereon, comprising walls surrounding a pocket, suitable to encompass the volume of<br>
the pouch, and wherein the raised walls define the seal. In general, it is preferred to<br>
provide pockets in the rollers to accommodate the belly of the pouch.<br>
As noted above, it is preferred that the second set of rollers shares the same<br>
drive as the first set of rollers.<br>
Preferred apparatus has means to draw away the web skeleton after the second<br>
pair of rollers. Such apparatus may also comprise punches to separate the pouches from<br>
the web skeleton.<br>
Preferred apparatus also comprises differential temperature controls are provided<br>
for each opposing roller.<br>
In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment, apparatus of the<br>
invention further comprises outer pouch forming means arranged to entrain severed<br>
pouches generated by the second pair of rollers.<br>
Also, as noted above, each process step is preferably no more than three cycles<br>
removed from the next, and preferably no more than one cycle removed from the next.<br>
Particularly preferred apparatus has all parts, from and including pouch content<br>
extrusion/dispensing through to sealing of the pouch, arranged in a single,<br>
atmospherically controlled unit. This single unit preferably also comprises the<br>
secondary packaging unit.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2, and provides two series of twin opposing mono-block cylinders to<br>
create a continuous manufacturing process for pouches and patches. The first series of<br>
mono-blocks seal together two parallel webs of material to create a reservoir that<br>
encapsulates the chosen formulation inserted between the two material webs. The<br>
second series of mono-blocks cut out the sealed patch or pouch template. In a third<br>
station, twin webs of outer pouch material are drawn into twin sealing rollers, collecting<br>
one or more pouches, subsequent sealing jaws serving to seal the outer pouch.<br>
More specifically, pouch wrapping materials A and B are fed to the upper<br>
sealing rollers. In this embodiment, a dose tube is shown, dispensing a dose of pouch<br>
contents onto the wrapping material B. This is for illustrative purposes only, and it will<br>
be appreciated that the dose may be applied to either or both webs, and may be<br>
dispensed in any suitable fashion appropriate to the pouch contents. A nozzle to<br>
dispense liquids or powders will generally be located immediately above the sealing<br>
junction, contents being dispensed when a pouch is partially formed and sealed, so as to<br>
be able to receive the contents without spillage.<br><br>
This and subsequent steps are performed under a sterile, or clean, atmosphere,<br>
such as a nitrogen blanket (not shown). While the atmosphere may be static, it is<br>
preferred to circulate and filter the atmosphere.<br>
The wrapping materials are sealed in the areas defined by the forms on the<br>
sealing rollers as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the conjoined web materials<br>
with sealed pouches then drops to the next pair of rollers, where the pouches are cut out.<br>
In this arrangement, the web is guided by the raised walls at the perimeter of the cutter<br>
roller shown in Figure 2, but it is advantageous that no such guiding means is necessary,<br>
and the web, or skeleton, can drop straight into the cutter rollers, with a certain amount<br>
of traction lent by the cutting dies shown in Figure 2.<br>
The pouches then fall into the third, bagging station, still under the nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. As shown in the Figures, the waste skeleton is removed at this stage,<br>
allowing the individual pouches to drop into the forming outer pouches.<br>
The outer pouches are formed by feeding outer pouch material webs A and B<br>
into the lower sealing rollers. As shown in Figure 2, nitrogen can be blown into the<br>
outer pouch simultaneously to create a sterile atmosphere for the pouch, thereby<br>
removing the need for evacuation. A similar arrangement (not shown) is both possible<br>
and desirable when incorporating the pouch contents between the first pair of sealing<br>
rollers.<br>
All rollers are shown providing sufficient clearance as not to compress the<br>
contents of the pouch. The sealing jaws seal the tops and bottoms of the outer pouches,<br>
the top of one being the bottom of the next, a further cutting station optionally being<br>
provided in-line within 1-3 cycles, and an optional boxing or other container-filling<br>
function being optionally located thereafter.<br>
The Figures also demonstrate that the outer pouch material may be decorated.<br>
Here, the decoration is after pouches have been incorporated, although it is generally<br>
more preferred to decorate the outer materials prior to sealing.<br><br>
