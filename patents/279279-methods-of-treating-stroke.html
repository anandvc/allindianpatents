				<td>METHODS OF TREATING STROKE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/809,149, filed May 25, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. About 700,000 Americans will have a stroke this year. In the United States, stroke is the third most-frequent cause of death and a leading cause of severe, long-term disability.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention is based, in part, on the observation that modulation of VLA-1 can be used to treat an ischemic injury, e.g., stroke. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides methods of treating stroke in a subject. The method includes administering to the subject a VLA-1 antagonist in an amount effective to treat stroke. A "VLA-1 antagonist" refers to an agent (e.g., any compound) that at least partially inhibits an interaction or activity of VLA-1. For example, the agent at least partially inhibits an activity of VLA-1 (e.g., binding of VLA-1 to a ligand, e.g., collagen), or the agent at least partially inhibits a nucleic acid encoding VLA-1, e.g., to reduce VLA-1 protein expression. In one embodiment, the agent reduces the ability of VLA-1 to bind to collagen, e.g., collagen IV, e.g., reduces affinity of VLA-1/collagen binding by a factor of at least 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100, and/or reduces VLA-1/collagen binding by at least 5%, e.g., at least 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, or more, as compared to the binding in the absence of the agent.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is an anti-VLA-1 antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof. The anti-VLA-1 antibody can be a monoclonal antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. The anti-VLA-1 antibody can be full-length (e.g., an IgG (e.g., an IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgM, IgA (e.g., IgAl, IgA2), IgD, and IgE) or can include only an antigen-binding fragment (e.g., a Fab, F(ab')2 or scFv fragment, or one or more CDRs). An antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, can include two heavy chain immunoglobulins and two light chain immunoglobulins, or can be a single chain antibody. The antibody can, optionally,<br>
include a constant region chosen from a kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon or a mu constant region gene. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody includes a heavy and light chain constant region substantially from a human antibody, e.g., a human IgGl constant region or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody is a human antibody.<br>
In other embodiments, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, is a chimeric or humanized antibody. As discussed herein, the antibodies can be CDR-grafted, humanized, or more generally, antibodies having CDRs from a non-human antibody and a framework that is selected as less immunogenic in humans, e.g., less antigenic than the murine framework in which a murine CDR naturally occurs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the anti-VLA-1 antibody is a non-naturally occurring antibody, e.g., a chimeric, CDR-grafted, or humanized antibody having at least heavy chain CDR3, and preferably all heavy chain CDRs, more preferably all three heavy chain CDRs and all three light chain CDRs from a nonhuman antibody, e.g., a nonhuman antibody described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the CDRs can differ from a CDR referred to herein by 1, 2 or 3 amino acid residues, e.g., heavy chain CDR3 can be from a source described herein but otherwise another CDR can vary as described herein.<br>
Preferred anti-VLA-1 antibodies include, e.g., a humanized AQC2 antibody (e.g., produced by a hybridoma having ATCC Deposit No. PTA-3274), AJH10 (ATCC PTA-3580), hAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3275), haAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3274), hsAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3356), mAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3273), and monoclonal antibody 1B3 (ATCC HB-10536). In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody can bind to the same epitope as AQC2, AJH10, hAQC2, haAQC2, hsAQC2, mAQC2, and/or 1B3. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody competes with AQC2, AJH10, hAQC2, haAQC2, hsAQC2, mAQC2, and/or 1B3 for binding to VLA-1.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody binds to the II subunit of VLA-1, e.g., the II-I domain of VLA-1.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a polypeptide, e.g., laminin or collagen I, III or IV, or a VLA-1 binding peptide of laminin or collagen I, III or IV described herein. In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a VLA-1 peptide, e.g., a fragment of the II subunit, e.g., a fragment of the Il-I domain containing the amino acid sequence VQRGGR or a similar amino acid sequence with conservative amino<br>
acid substitutions. The laminin, collagen or VLA-1 peptides block VLA-1 function as tested by, e.g., its ability to inhibit K562-I1 dependent adhesion to collagen IV as described herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is an inhibitor of the expression or translation of an VLA-1 nucleic acid, such as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, an antisense molecule, a ribozyme, a triple helix molecule, aptamer, or any combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a small molecule described herein (e.g., a chemical agent having a molecular weight of less than 2500 Da, preferably, less than 1500 Da), or a chemical, e.g., a small organic molecule.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist can be administered in an amount and/or for a time sufficient to reduce ischemic damage in neuronal tissue in the brain.<br>
The subject is typically a mammal, e.g., human, dog, cat, monkey, rabbit, or agriculture mammal (e.g., horse, cow, pig, and so on). For example, the subject is a human, e.g., a human male or female. The subject can be at least 18, 25, 30, 45, 50, 55, 60, or 70 years old.<br>
In one embodiment, the subject has experienced a stroke. The stroke can be a hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).<br>
In one embodiment, the subject has experienced a stroke within 48 hours, e.g., within 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20, or 30 hours of treatment. In another embodiment, the subject has experienced a stroke more than 48 hours before, but within the last three or two weeks, of treatment.<br>
In another embodiment, the subject is at risk for stroke, e.g., has experienced or is experiencing conditions that create a risk for stroke. Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure; tobacco use; diabetes mellitus; carotid or other artery disease; peripheral artery disease; atrial fibrillation; other heart disease; transient ischemic attacks (TIAs); certain blood disorders (e.g., high red blood cell count; Sickle cell disease); high blood cholesterol; physical inactivity and obesity; excessive alcohol; some illegal drugs; a prior stroke; or prior heart attack.<br>
In one embodiment, the subject exhibits one or more of the following symptoms: sudden numbness or weakness of the face, sudden numbness or weakness of an arm; sudden numbness or weakness of a leg; sudden confusion; sudden trouble speaking; sudden trouble understanding; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;<br>
sudden trouble walking; sudden dizziness; sudden loss of balance or coordination; sudden and severe headache with no known cause. In some embodiments, the subject has been diagnosed as having sustained a stroke.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered in an amount sufficient to reduce infarct size, e.g., by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% or more, in neuronal tissue in the brain, relative to the infarct size in an untreated subject. The amount sufficient to reduce infarct size can be evaluated using an animal model, e.g., as described herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered in an amount sufficient to improve symptoms in one or more stroke assessment criterion, e.g., a criterion or scale described herein, by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% or more, or by a half-step or full step in the scale. For example, modified Rankin scale score can be reduced by at least 1 step, e.g., by at least 2, 3 or 4 steps, and/or the score can be decreased to, e.g., 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0. NIHSS score can be reduced by at least 1 step, e.g., by at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 steps or more, and/or the score can be decreased to, e.g., 15, 13, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0. Barthel index score can be increased by at least 5 steps, e.g., at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 steps or more, and/or the score can be increased to, e.g., 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered at a dosage of 0.025 mg/kg per day to 30 mg/kg per day, e.g., 0.1 to 5 mg/kg, e.g., 0.3 to 3 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered at least twice within a 14 day period after a stroke, e.g., at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 times within a 14 day period after a stroke. The antagonist can be administered, for example, once daily, once every other day, twice a week, once a week, or once per day for 1 day, e.g., for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 or 28 days. The VLA-1 antagonist can be administered intravenously or parenterally.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered in combination with a treatment for stroke. For example, the treatment includes administering a second agent that provides a therapeutic benefit to a patient who has or is at risk for stroke. Exemplary second agents include, e.g., a thrombolytic agent (e.g., streptokinase, acylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), urokinase, single-chain urokinase-plasminogen activator (scu-PA), anti-inflammatory agents, thrombin-<br>
like enzymes from snake venoms such as ancrod, thrombin inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and biologically active variants of each of the above); an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin or heparin); antiplatelet drug (e.g., aspirin); a glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitor; a glycosaminoglycan; coumarin; GCSF; melatonin; an apoptosis inhibitor (e.g., caspase inhibitor), an anti-oxidant (e.g., NXY-059); and a neuroprotectant (e.g., an NMDA receptor antagonists or a cannabinoid antagonist).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist and the second agent are administered at the same time. In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered first in time and the second agent is administered second in time. In a preferred embodiment, the second agent is administered first in time and the VLA-1 antagonist is administered second in time.<br>
As used herein, "administered in combination" means that two or more agents (e.g., the VLA-1 antagonist and the second agent) are administered to a subject at the same time or within an interval, such that there is overlap of an effect of each agent on the patient. Preferably the administrations of the first and second agent are spaced sufficiently close together such that a combinatorial effect is achieved. The interval can be an interval of hours, days or weeks. Generally, the agents are concurrently bioavailable, e.g., detectable, in the subject. In a preferred embodiment at least one administration of one of the agents, e.g., the first agent, is made while the other agent, e.g., the VLA-1 antagonist, is still present at a therapeutic level in the subject.<br>
In one embodiment, the method also includes evaluating the subject for a post-stroke criterion, e.g., a stroke assessment criterion or scale described herein. In some embodiments, the evaluation is performed at least 1 hour, e.g., at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, or 48 hours, or at least 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, 13 weeks, 20 weeks or more, after the administration of the VLA-1 antagonist. The subject can be evaluated in one or more of the following periods: prior to beginning of treatment; during the treatment; or after one or more elements of the treatment have been administered. Evaluating can include evaluating the need for further treatment with the same VLA-1 antagonist or for additional treatment with additional agents. In a preferred embodiment, if a preselected outcome of the evaluation is obtained, an additional step is taken, e.g., the subject is administered another treatment or another evaluation or test is performed.<br>
In another embodiment, the method further includes a step of identifying a subject who has a stroke (e.g., ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack) or symptoms of a stroke.<br>

The anti-VLA-1 antibody can be full-length (e.g., an IgG (e.g., an IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgM, IgA (e.g., IgAl, IgA2), IgD, and IgE) or can include only an antigen-binding fragment (e.g., a Fab, F(ab')2 or scFv fragment, or one or more CDRs). An antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, can include two heavy chain immunoglobulins and two light chain immunoglobulins, or can be a single chain antibody. The antibody can, optionally, include a constant region chosen from a kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon or a mu constant region gene. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody includes a heavy and light chain constant region substantially from a human antibody, e.g., a human IgGl constant region or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody is a human antibody.<br>
In other embodiments, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, is a chimeric or humanized antibody. As discussed herein, the antibodies can be CDR-grafted, humanized, or more generally, antibodies having CDRs from a non-human antibody and a framework that is selected as less immunogenic in humans, e.g., less antigenic than the murine framework in which a murine CDR naturally occurs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the anti-VLA-1 antibody is a non-naturally occurring antibody, e.g., a chimeric, CDR-grafted, or humanized antibody having at least heavy chain CDR3, and preferably all heavy chain CDRs, more preferably all three heavy chain CDRs and all three light chain CDRs from a nonhuman antibody, e.g., a nonhuman antibody described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the CDRs can differ from a CDR referred to herein by 1, 2 or 3 amino acid residues, e.g., heavy chain CDR3 can be from a source described herein but otherwise another CDR can vary as described herein.<br>
Preferred anti-VLA-1 antibodies include, e.g., a humanized AQC2 antibody (e.g., produced by a hybridoma having ATCC Deposit No. PTA-3274), AJH10 (ATCC PTA-3580), hAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3275), haAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3274), hsAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3356), mAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3273) and monoclonal antibody 1B3 (ATCC HB-10536). In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody can bind to the same epitope as AQC2, AJH10, hAQC2, haAQC2, hsAQC2, mAQC2 and/or 1B3. In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody competes with AQC2, AJH10, hAQC2, haAQC2, hsAQC2, mAQC2 and/or 1B3 for binding to VLA-1.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-VLA-1 antibody binds to the II subunit of VLA-1, e.g., the II-I domain of VLA-1.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a polypeptide, e.g., laminin or collagen I, III or IV, or a VLA-1 binding peptide of laminin or collagen I, III or IV described herein. In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a VLA-1 peptide, e.g., a fragment of the II subunit, e.g., a fragment of the II-I domain containing the amino acid sequence VQRGGR or a similar amino acid sequence with conservative amino acid substitutions. The laminin, collagen or VLA-1 peptides block VLA-1 function as tested by, e.g., its ability to inhibit K562-I1 dependent adhesion to collagen IV as described herein. In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is an inhibitor of the expression or translation of an VLA-1 nucleic acid, such as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, an antisense molecule, a ribozyme, a triple helix molecule, an aptamer or any combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is a small molecule described herein (e.g., a chemical agent having a molecular weight of less than 2500 Da, preferably, less than 1500 Da), or a chemical, e.g., a small organic molecule.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist can be administered in an amount and/or for a time sufficient to treat SCI, e.g., to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect SCI, e.g., one or more symptoms of SCI described herein.<br>
The subject is typically a mammal, e.g., human, dog, cat, monkey, rabbit, or agriculture mammal (e.g., horse, cow, pig, and so on). For example, the subject is a human, e.g., a human male or female. The subject can be at least 18, 25, 30, 45, 50, 55, 60, or 70 years old.<br>

In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered in an amount sufficient to improve symptoms in one or more SCI assessment criterion, e.g., a criterion described herein, by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80%, or more.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered at a dosage of 0.025 mg/kg per day to 30 mg/kg per day, e.g., 0.1 to 5 mg/kg, e.g., 0.3 to 3 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered at least twice within a 14 day period after a stroke, e.g., at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 times within a 14 day period after a stroke. The antagonist can be administered, for example, once daily, once every other day, twice a week, once a week, or once per day for 1 day, e.g., for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 or 28 days. The VLA-1 antagonist can be administered intravenously or parenterally.<br>
In one embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered in combination with a second agent for treatment for SCI. The second agent can be, e.g., a corticosteroid or a glucocorticoid such as methylprednisolone. In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist and the second agent are administered at the same time. In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered first in time and the second agent is administered second in time. In a preferred embodiment, the second agent is administered first in time and the VLA-1 antagonist is administered second in time.<br>

In some embodiments, the evaluation is performed at least 1 hour, e.g., at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, or 48 hours, or at least 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, 13 weeks, 20 weeks or more, after the administration of the VLA-1 antagonist. The subject can be evaluated in one or more of the following periods: prior to beginning of treatment; during the treatment; or after one or more elements of the treatment have been administered. Evaluating can include evaluating the need for further treatment with the same VLA-1 antagonist or for additional treatment with additional agents. In a preferred embodiment, if a preselected outcome of the evaluation is obtained, an additional step is taken, e.g., the subject is administered another treatment or another evaluation or test is performed.<br>
In one aspect, the disclosure features a VLA-1 antagonist for use in treating SCI, e.g., as described herein. The antagonist can be a VLA-1 antagonist described herein, e.g., a VLA-1 antibody described herein. In another aspect, the disclosure features the use of a VLA-1 antagonist for the manufacture of a medicament for treating SCI, e.g., as described herein. The antagonist can be a VLA-1 antagonist described herein, e.g., a VLA-1 antibody described herein.<br>
In one aspect, the disclosure features a container that includes a VLA-1 antagonist, e.g., a VLA-1 antibody, and a label with instructions for use of the antagonist in treating SCI.<br>
As used herein, the term "treatment", "treat" or "treating" refers to administering a therapy in an amount, manner, and/or mode effective to improve a condition, symptom, or parameter associated with a disorder (e.g., stroke, TBI or SCI) or to reduce onset, progression, or exacerbation of the disorder (including secondary damage caused by the disorder, e.g., stroke, TBI or SCI), to either a statistically significant degree or to a degree detectable to one skilled in the art. Accordingly, treating can achieve therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefits. An effective amount, manner, or mode can vary depending on the subject and may be tailored to the subject. As used herein, "treatment" also encompasses the prophylactic treatment of subjects with an elevated risk for stroke, for example a subject who has experienced a transient<br>
ischemic attack. In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered after the ischemic injury. In a preferred embodiment, the VLA-1 antagonist is administered after the subject has had a stroke.<br>
As used herein, "an amount effective to treat", or a "therapeutically effective amount", refers to an amount of a VLA-1 antagonist that is effective, upon single or multiple dose administrations to a subject, to improve or prophylactically treat a condition, symptom, or parameter associated with a disorder or to reduce onset, progression, or exacerbation of the disorder, to either a statistically significant degree or to a degree detectable to one skilled in the art. For example, in the context of stroke, "an amount effective to treat" is an amount sufficient to reduce infarct size, e.g., by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% or more, in neuronal tissue in the brain, relative to the infarct size in an untreated subject. Alternatively, "an amount effective to treat" is an amount sufficient to improve symptoms in one or more stroke, TBI or SCI assessment criterion described herein by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% or more.<br>
As used herein, "stroke" is a general term that refers to conditions caused by the occlusion or hemorrhage of one or more blood vessels supplying the brain, leading to cell death. "Ischemic stroke", as used herein, refers to stroke caused by an occlusion of one or more blood vessels supplying the brain. Types of ischemic stroke include, e.g., embolic stroke, cardioembolic stroke, thrombotic stroke, large vessel thrombosis, lacunar infarction, artery-artery stroke and cryptogenic stroke. "Hemorrhagic stroke", as used herein, refers to stroke caused by hemorrhage of one or more blood vessels supplying the brain. Types of hemorrhagic stroke include, e.g., subdural stroke, intraparenchymal stroke, epidural stroke and subarachnoid stroke.<br>
As used herein, "traumatic brain injury" or "TBI" refers to damage to the brain caused by physical force or trauma. TBI can be primary of secondary. "Primary TBI" occurs immediately following the physical force or trauma and can result, e.g., in expanding hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral edema, raised intracranial pressure, and cerebral hypoxia. "Secondary TBI" can occur over a period of hours to days following the physical force or trauma and can lead to severe secondary events (e.g., stroke). TBI is defined as "mild" when a patient scores between 13 and 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Mild TBI can be associated with a loss of consciousness (LOC) for 5 minutes or less after the physical force or trauma and/or amnesia for a<br>
period of 10 minutes or less after the physical force or trauma. TBI is defined as "moderate to severe" when a patient scores less than 13 on the GCS.<br>
As used herein, "spinal cord injury" or "SCI" refers to a traumatic injury sustained to the spinal cord and/or the area around it. The spinal cord may be compressed, severed or contused, leading to physical or physiological damage to the axons and affecting neuroelectrical impulse conduction along the length of the affected axons. Large populations of axons, including their associated cell bodies, may die, causing loss of communication between the brain and the peripheral nerves. SCI thus leads to sudden loss of complete or partial motor function, the extent of which depends on the location of the injury. Higher (cervical) SCI can result in total loss of motor function, quadriplegia, loss of respiratory control, and/or cardiovascular collapse. Lower (thoracic) SCI can result in paraplegia without involving arm or respiratory dysfunction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The results presented herein show that a blocking VLA-1 antibody can reduce infarct size in vivo in a model of cerebral ischemia. The results demonstrate, among other things, that administration of a VLA-1 antagonist, e.g., a VLA-1 antibody, can reduce ischemic injury in the CNS, particularly traumatic ischemic injury. Accordingly, a VLA-1 antagonist, e.g., a VLA-1 antibody, can be administered to treat stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and spinal cord injury (SCI), e.g., alone or in combination with another treatment, as well as other ischemic injuries.<br>
VLA-1<br>
Integrins are a superfamily of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These proteins are known to provide anchorage as well as signals for cellular growth, migration and differentiation during development and tissue repair. They have been implicated in immune and inflammatory processes.<br>
Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two noncovalently linked polypeptide chains, I and S. The amino terminus of each chain forms a globular head that contributes to interchain linking and to ligand binding. The globular heads are connected to the transmembrane segments by stalks. The cytoplasmic tails are usually less than 50 amino acid residues long. Integrin subfamilies were originally defined on the basis of which S subunit was used to form the heterodimers. The SI-containing integrins are also called VLA molecules, referring to "very late activation" antigens. VLA-1 to VLA-6 refer to SI subfamily members containing II to 16 (i.e., CD49a to CD49f), respectively. For general review, see Cellular and Molecular Immunology, eds. Abul K. Abbas et al., W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA, 2000.<br>
Collagen (both types I and IV) and laminin are known ligands of 1101 integrin (i.e., VLA-1). VLA-1 has been implicated in cell adhesion and migration on collagen (Keely et al., 1995, J. Cell Sci. 108: 595-607; and Gotwals et al., 1996, J. Clin. Invest. 97: 2469-2477); in promoting contraction and reorganization of collagen matrices, a critical component of wound healing (Gotwals et al., supra ; and Chiro, 1991,Cell 67 : 403-410); and in regulating the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (Riikonen et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 1-5; and Langholz et al., 1995, J. Cell Biol. 131: 1903-1915).<br>
VLA-1 antagonists<br>
A variety of agents can be used as VLA-1 antagonists to treat stroke. Such agents include antibodies to VLA-1 or to a part of VLA-1, e.g., to the II subunit of VLA-1. Some preferred agents include the anti-VLA-1 antibodies disclosed in U.S. Patent Applications 60/283,794, filed April 14, 2001 and 60/303,689, filed July 6, 2001, and disclosed in WO 02/083854. The disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Other agents include small molecules that block the interaction of VLA-1 to its ligand, e.g., collagen or laminin, or modulate integrin cell signaling to decrease a cellular activity or biochemical function associated with VLA-1. Agents useful in the methods disclosed herein also include those that reduce the expression of VLA-1, such as by gene therapy and antisense technology.<br>
Anti-VLA-1 antibodies<br>
Exemplary VLA-1 antagonists include antibodies that bind to VLA-1. In one embodiment, the antibody inhibits the interaction between VLA-1 and a VLA-1 ligand (e.g., collagen), e.g., by physically blocking the interaction, decreasing the affinity of VLA-1 and/or a VLA-1 ligand for its counterpart, disrupting or destabilizing VLA-1 complexes, sequestering VLA-1, or targeting VLA-1 for degradation. In one embodiment, the antibody can bind to VLA-1 at one or more amino acid residues that participate in the VLA-1/ligand binding interface. Such amino acid residues can be identified, e.g., by alanine scanning. In another embodiment, the antibody can bind to residues that do not participate in the VLA-1/ligand binding. For example, the antibody can alter a conformation of VLA-1 and thereby reduce binding affinity, or the antibody may sterically hinder VLA-1/ligand binding. In one embodiment, the antibody can reduce activation of a VLA-1 mediated event or activity.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a protein that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable region, e.g., an amino acid sequence that provides an immunoglobulin variable domain or an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term "antibody" encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments,<br>
Fd fragments, Fv fragments, and dAb fragments) as well as complete antibodies, e.g., intact and/or full length immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof). The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. In one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity, or may be non-functional for one or both of these activities.<br>
The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed "complementarity determining regions" ("CDR"), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed "framework regions" (FR). The extent of the FR's and CDR's has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E.A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242; and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917). Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDR's and four FR's, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.<br>
An "immunoglobulin domain" refers to a domain from the variable or constant domain of immunoglobulin molecules. Immunoglobulin domains typically contain two (3-sheets formed of about seven P-strands, and a conserved disulphide bond (see, e.g., A, F. Williams and A. N. Barclay (1988) Ann. Rev Immunol. 6:381-405). An "immunoglobulin variable domain sequence" refers to an amino acid sequence that can form a structure sufficient to position CDR sequences in a conformation suitable for antigen binding. For example, the sequence may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that includes an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form a target binding structure (or "antigen binding site"), e.g., a structure that interacts with VLA-1.<br>
The VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy<br>
immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains. The heavy and light immunoglobulin chains can be connected by disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant region typically includes three constant domains, CHI, CH2, and CH3. The light chain constant region typically includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.<br>
One or more regions of an antibody can be human, effectively human, or humanized. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs, e.g., HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3, can be human. Each of the light chain CDRs can be human. HC CDR3 can be human. One or more of the framework regions can be human, e.g., FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 of the HC or LC. In one embodiment, all the framework regions are human, e.g., derived from a human somatic cell, e.g., a hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell. In one embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, e.g., encoded by a germline nucleic acid. One or more of the constant regions can be human, effectively human, or humanized. In another embodiment, at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, or 98% of the framework regions (e.g., FRl, FR2, and FR3, collectively, or FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4, collectively) or the entire antibody can be human, effectively human, or humanized. For example, FRl, FR2, and FR3 collectively can be at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% identical, or completely identical, to a human sequence encoded by a human germline segment.<br>
An "effectively human" immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. An "effectively human" antibody is an antibody that includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.<br>
A "humanized" immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that is modified such that the modified form elicits less of an immune response in a human than does the non-modified form, e.g., is modified to include a sufficient<br>
number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of "humanized" immunoglobulins include, for example, US Pat. Nos. 6,407,213 and 5,693,762. In some cases, humanized immunoglobulins can include a non-human amino acid at one or more framework amino acid positions.<br>
Anti-VLA-1 antibodies can also be chimeric antibodies, e.g., generated by engineering a cognate (e.g., murine, rat or rabbit) antibody. For instance, a cognate antibody can be altered by recombinant DNA technology such that part or all of the hinge and/or constant regions of the heavy and/or light chains are replaced with the corresponding components of an antibody from another species (e.g., human). Generally, the variable domains of the engineered antibody remain identical or substantially so to the variable domains of the cognate antibody. Such an engineered antibody is called a chimeric antibody and is less antigenic than the cognate antibody when administered to an individual of the species from which the hinge and/or constant region is derived (e.g., a human). Methods of making chimeric antibodies are well known in the art. Preferred constant regions include, but are not limited to, those derived from IgGl and IgG4.<br>
Exemplary anti-VLA-1 antibodies useful in the methods described herein include, for example, monoclonal antibody AJH10 (ATCC PTA-3580; deposited on August 2, 2001 with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209), hAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3275; deposited on April 18, 15 2001), haAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3274; deposited on April 18, 2001), hsAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3356; deposited on May 4, 2001) and mAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3273). All of these antibodies were deposited under the Budapest Treaty. Other anti-VLA-1 antibodies include, e.g., monoclonal antibody 1B3 (ATCC HB-10536) described in U.S. Patents 5, 391,481 and 5,788,966, and Ha31/8.<br>
Antibody generation<br>
Antibodies that bind to VLA-1 can be generated by a variety of means, including immunization, e.g., using an animal, or in vitro methods such as phage display. All or part of VLA-1 can be used as an immunogen or as a target for selection. For example, VLA-1 or a fragment thereof, e.g., all or a part of an II subunit of VLA-1, e.g., an II-I domain, can be used as an immunogen. In one embodiment, the<br>
immunized animal contains immunoglobulin producing cells with natural, human, or partially human immunoglobulin loci. In one embodiment, the non-human animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected. See, e.g., XENOMOUSE™, Green et al. (1994) Nat. Gen. 7:13-21; US 2003-0070185; US Pat. No. 5,789,650; and WO 96/34096.<br>
Non-human antibodies to VLA-1 can also be produced, e.g., in a rodent. The non-human antibody can be humanized, e.g., as described in EP 239 400; US Pat. Nos. 6,602,503; 5,693,761; and 6,407,213, deimmunized, or otherwise modified to make it effectively human.<br>
EP 239 400 (Winter et al.) describes altering antibodies by substitution (within a given variable region) of their complementarity determining regions (CDRs) for one species with those from another. Typically, CDRs of a non-human (e.g., murine) antibody are substituted into the corresponding regions in a human antibody by using recombinant nucleic acid technology to produce sequences encoding the desired substituted antibody. Human constant region gene segments of the desired isotype (usually gamma I for CH and kappa for CL) can be added and the humanized heavy and light chain genes can be co-expressed in mammalian cells to produce soluble humanized antibody. Other methods for humanizing antibodies can also be used. For example, other methods can account for the three dimensional structure of the antibody, framework positions that are in three dimensional proximity to binding determinants, and immunogenic peptide sequences. See, e.g., WO 90/07861; US Pat. Nos. 5,693,762; 5,693,761; 5,585,089; and 5,530,101; Tempest et al. (1991) Biotechnology 9:266-271 and US Pat. No. 6,407,213.<br>
At times, direct transfer of CDRs to a human framework leads to a loss of antigen-binding affinity of the resultant antibody. This is because in some cognate antibodies, certain amino acids within the framework regions interact with the CDRs and thus influence the overall antigen binding affinity of the antibody. In such cases, it would be critical to introduce "back mutations" in the framework regions of the acceptor antibody in order to retain the antigen-binding activity of the cognate antibody. The general approach of making back mutations is known in the art. For<br>
instance, Queen et al.(supra), Co et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA88 : 2869-2873(1991), and WO 90/07861 (Protein Design Labs Inc.) describe an approach that involves two key steps. First, the human V framework regions are chosen by computer analysis for optimal protein sequence homology to the V region framework of the cognate murine antibody. Then, the tertiary structure of the murine V region is modeled by computer in order to visualize framework amino acid residues that are likely to interact with the murine CDRs, and these murine amino acid residues are then superimposed on the homologous human framework. Under this two-step approach, there are several criteria for designing humanized antibodies. The first criterion is to use as the human acceptor the framework from a particular human immunoglobulin that is usually homologous to the non-human donor immunoglobulin, or to use a consensus framework from many human antibodies. The second criterion is to use the donor amino acid rather than the acceptor if the human acceptor residue is unusual and the donor residue is typical for human sequences at a specific residue of the framework. The third criterion is to use the donor framework amino acid residue rather than the acceptor at positions immediately adjacent to the CDRs.<br>
One may also use a different approach as described in, e.g., Tempest, Biotechnology 9: 266-271 (1991). Under this approach, the V region frameworks derived from NEWM and REI heavy and light chains, respectively, are used for CDR-grafting without radical introduction of mouse residues. An advantage of using this approach is that the three-dimensional structures of NEWM and REI variable regions are known from X-ray crystallography and thus specific interactions between CDRs and V region framework residues can be readily modeled.<br>
Fully human monoclonal antibodies that bind to VLA-1 can be produced, e.g., using in vitro-primed human splenocytes, as described by Boerner et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:86-95. They may also be prepared by repertoire cloning as described by Persson et al. (1991) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2432-2436 or by Huang and Stollar (1991) J. Immunol. Methods 141:227-236; also US Pat. No. 5,798,230. Large nonimmunized human phage display libraries may also be used to isolate high affinity antibodies that can be developed as human therapeutics using standard phage technology (see, e.g., Hoogenboom et al. (1998) Immunotechnology 4:1-20; Hoogenboom et al. (2000) Immunol Today 2:371-8; and US 2003-0232333). Other methods for producing fully human antibodies involve the use of non-human animals<br>
that have inactivated endogenous Ig loci and are transgenic for un-rearranged human antibody heavy chain and light chain genes. Such transgenic animals can be immunized with II-I or a desired antigenic fragment thereof, and hybridomas are then made from B cells derived therefrom. These methods are described in, e.g., the various GenPharm/Medarex (Palo Alto, CA) publications/patents concerning transgenic mice containing human Ig miniloci (e.g., U. S. Patent 5,789, 650); the various Abgenix (Fremont, CA) publications/patents with respect to XENOMICE (e.g., U. S. Patents 6,075,181; 6,150,584 and 6,162, 963; Green et al., Nature Genetics 7: 13-21 (1994); and Mendez et al., 15 (2): 146-56 (1997)); and the various Kirin (Japan) publications/patents concerning "transomic" mice (e.g., EP 843 961, and Tomizuka et al., Nature Genetics 16: 133-1443 (1997)).<br>
Antibody and Protein Production<br>
Antibodies and other proteins described herein can be produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the antibodies (e.g., scFv's) are expressed in a yeast cell such as Pichia (see, e.g., Powers et al. (2001) J. Immunol. Methods 251:123-35), Hanseula, or Saccharomyces.<br>
Antibodies, particularly full length antibodies, e.g., IgG's, can be produced in mammalian cells. Exemplary mammalian host cells for recombinant expression include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr- CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp (1982) Mol. Biol. 159:601-621), lymphocytic cell lines, e.g., NS0 myeloma cells and SP2 cells, COS cells, K562, and a cell from a transgenic animal, e.g., a transgenic mammal. For example, the cell is a mammary epithelial cell.<br>
In addition to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the immunoglobulin domain, the recombinant expression vectors may carry additional nucleic acid sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells {e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., US Pat. Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; and 5,179,017). Exemplary selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).<br>
In an exemplary system for recombinant expression of an antibody (e.g., a full length antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof), a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr- CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (e.g., derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element) to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, to transfect the host cells, to select for transformants, to culture the host cells, and to recover the antibody from the culture medium. For example, some antibodies can be isolated by affinity chromatography with a Protein A or Protein G.<br>
Antibodies may also include modifications, e.g., modifications that alter Fc function, e.g., to decrease or remove interaction with an Fc receptor or with Clq, or both. For example, the human IgGl constant region can be mutated at one or more residues, e.g., one or more of residues 234 and 237, e.g., according to the numbering in US Pat. No. 5,648,260. Other exemplary modifications include those described in US Pat. No. 5,648,260.<br>
For some proteins that include an Fc domain, the antibody/protein production system may be designed to synthesize antibodies or other proteins in which the Fc region is glycosylated. For example, the Fc domain of IgG molecules is glycosylated at asparagine 297 in the CH2 domain. The Fc domain can also include other eukaryotic post-translational modifications. In other cases, the protein is produced in a form that is not glycosylated.<br>
Antibodies can also be produced by a transgenic animal. For example, US Pat. No. 5,849,992 describes a method for expressing an antibody in the mammary gland of a transgenic mammal. A transgene is constructed that includes a milk-specific promoter and nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody of interest, e.g., an<br>
antibody described herein, and a signal sequence for secretion. The milk produced by females of such transgenic mammals includes, secreted-therein, the protein of interest, e.g., an antibody. The protein can be purified from the milk, or for some applications, used directly.<br>
Other Moieties<br>
The antibodies described herein may further comprise other moieties to effect the desired functions. For instance, the antibodies may include atoxin moiety (e.g., tetanus toxoid or ricin) or a radionuclide (e.g., nlIn or 90Y) for killing of cells targeted by the antibodies (see, e.g., U. S. Patent 6,307, 026). The antibodies may comprise a moiety (e.g., biotin, fluorescent moieties, radioactive moieties, histidine tags, etc.) for easy isolation or detection. The antibodies may also comprise a moiety that can prolong their serum half life, for example, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety.<br>
Polypeptide Antagonists<br>
In addition to antibodies, VLA-1 antagonists useful in the methods described herein include polypeptides that inhibit the function of VLA-1, e.g., by blocking the interaction between VLA-1 and its physiological ligands such as collagen, e.g., collagen I, III, or IV, or laminin, or by modulating VLA-1 -dependent cell signaling.<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist is an agent that has one or more of the following properties: (1) it coats, or binds to, a VLA-1 antigen on the surface of a VLA-1 bearing cell with sufficient specificity to inhibit a VLA-1/VLA-1-ligand interaction, e.g., the VLA-1/collagen interaction; (2) it coats, or binds to, a VLA-1 antigen on the surface of a VLA-1 bearing cell with sufficient specificity to modify, and preferably to inhibit, transduction of a VLA-1-mediated signal, e.g., VLA-1/collagen-mediated signaling; (3) it coats, or binds to, a VLA-1-ligand, e.g., collagen (e.g., collagen I, III or IV) or laminin, with sufficient specificity to inhibit the VLA-1/VLA-1-ligand interaction; (4) it coats, or binds to, a VLA-1 -ligand, e.g., collagen (e.g., collagen I, HI or IV) or laminin, with sufficient specificity to modify, and preferably to inhibit, transduction of VLA-1-ligand mediated VLA-1 signaling, e.g., collagen-mediated VLA-1 signaling. In preferred embodiments the VLA-1 antagonist has one or both of properties 1 and 2. In other preferred embodiments the VLA-1 antagonist has one or both of properties 3 and 4.<br>
For purposes of the methods described herein, any agent capable of binding to VLA-1 antigens on the surface of VLA-1 bearing cells and that effectively blocks or coats VLA-1 antigens, is considered to be an equivalent of the monoclonal antibody used in the examples herein.<br>
As discussed herein, the VLA-1 antagonists used in methods described herein are not limited to antibodies or antibody derivatives, but may be other molecules, e.g., soluble forms of other proteins that bind VLA-1, e.g., the natural binding proteins for VLA-1. These antagonists include collagen I, III, or IV; VLA-1 binding peptides of collagen I, III or IV; laminin; and VLA-1 binding peptides of laminin (see, e.g., Pfaff et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 225:975-84, 1994; Colognato-Pyke et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 9398-9406, 1995; and Colognato et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272: 29330-29336, 1997). For example, VLA-1 binding peptides of collagen I, III or IV can contain the amino acid sequence GFOGER (see, e.g. Knight et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:35-40, 2000), GROGER (see, e.g., Kim et al., J. Biol. Chem. 280:32512-32520, 2005), or a similar conservatively substituted amino acid sequence. Other antagonists include VLA-1 peptides, such as a peptide containing the amino acid sequence VQRGGR or a similar conservatively substituted amino acid sequence, and peptide mimetics, such as those described in WO 01/96365; U.S. Patents 6,326, 403 and 6,001,961. These antagonists can act by competing with the cell-surface binding protein for VLA-1 or by otherwise altering VLA-1 function.<br>
Small Molecule Antagonists<br>
In addition to antibodies, VLA-1 antagonists useful in the methods described herein include any non-antibody compounds that inhibit the function of VLA-1, e.g., by blocking the interaction between VLA-1 and its physiological ligands such as collagen, or by modulatingVLA-1-dependent cell signaling. Examples of these compounds are small molecule compounds, e.g., those described in Weitz-Schmidt et al., Nat. Med. 7:687-692, 2001). These compounds can be identified using, e.g., combinatorial small molecule libraries, combinatorial antibody libraries, rational drug designs, and traditional organic synthesis followed by screening for antagonism using any method known in the art.<br>
In one example, recombinantly expressed VLA-1 or functional fragments thereof can be used to screen libraries of natural, semisynthetic or synthetic<br>
compounds. Particularly useful types of libraries include combinatorial small organic molecule libraries, phage display libraries, and combinatorial peptide libraries.<br>
Methods of determining whether components of the library bind to a particular polypeptide are well known in the art. In general, the polypeptide target is attached to solid support surface by non-specific or specific binding. Specific binding can be accomplished using an antibody which recognizes the protein that is bound to a solid support, such as a plate or column. Alternatively, specific binding may be through an epitope tag, such as GST binding to a glutathione-coated solid support, or IgG fusion protein binding to a Protein A solid support.<br>
Alternatively, the recombinantly expressed VLA-1 or parts thereof may be expressed on the surface of phage, such as Ml 3. A library in mobile phase is incubated under conditions to promote specific binding between the target and a compound. Compounds that bind to the target can then be identified. Alternately, the library is attached to a solid support and the polypeptide target is in the mobile phase.<br>
Binding between a compound and theVLA-1 target can be determined by a number of methods. The binding can be identified by such techniques as competitive ELISAs or RIAs, for example, wherein the binding of a compound to a target will reduce binding of an antibody to the same target. These methods are well- known in the art. Another method is to use BiaCORE to measure interactions between a target and a compound using methods provided by the manufacturer. A preferred method is automated high throughput screening, see, e.g., Burbaum et al., Curr OpinChem Biol. 1: 72-8 (1997), and Schullek et al., Anal Biochem. 246: 20-9 (1997).<br>
Once a candidate compound that binds to a target is identified, one can determine whether the compound inhibits the activity of the target. For instance, the candidate compound can be used to screen for its ability to inhibit K562-I1 dependent adhesion to collagen IV See, e.g., U.S. Application 60/303,689 and WO 02/083854. In another example, the candidate compound is used to compete for binding of an anti-VLA-1 antibody to (1) a VLA-1-expressing cell, or (2) a molecule containing the II91 integrin or a fragment thereof, e.g., the Il-I domain.<br>
Another method to identify VLA-1 antagonists is to use the structure of recombinantly expressed VLA-1 for rational drug design. See, e.g., WO 01/73444.<br>
Nucleic acid antagonists<br>
In certain implementations, nucleic acid antagonists are used to decrease expression of an endogenous gene encoding VLA-1. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid antagonist is an siRNA that targets mRNA encoding VLA-1. Other types of blocking nucleic acids can also be used, e.g., a dsRNA, a ribozyme, a triple-helix former, an aptamer, or an antisense nucleic acid.<br>
siRNAs are small double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that optionally include overhangs. For example, the duplex region of an siRNA is about 18 to 25 nucleotides in length, e.g., about 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 nucleotides in length. Typically, the siRNA sequences are exactly complementary to the target mRNA. dsRNAs and siRNAs in particular can be used to silence gene expression in mammalian cells (e.g., human cells). See, e.g., Clemens et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:6499-6503; Billy et al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Sci. USA 98:14428-14433; Elbashir et al. (2001) Nature. 411:494-8; Yang et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:9942-9947, U.S. 20030166282, 20030143204, 20040038278, and 20030224432.<br>
Anti-sense agents can include, for example, from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 80 nucleotides), e.g., about 8 to about 50 nucleobases, or about 12 to about 30 nucleobases. Anti-sense compounds include ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides (oligozymes), and other short catalytic RNAs or catalytic oligonucleotides which hybridize to the target nucleic acid and modulate its expression. Anti-sense compounds can include a stretch of at least eight consecutive nucleobases that are complementary to a sequence in the target gene. An oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the target molecule to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment or, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are conducted.<br>
Hybridization of antisense oligonucleotides with mRNA (e.g., an mRNA encoding VLA-1) can interfere with one or more of the normal functions of mRNA. The functions of mRNA to be interfered with include all key functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of<br>
protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNAto yield one or more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in by the RNA. Binding of specific protein(s) to the RNA may also be interfered with by antisense oligonucleotide hybridization to the RNA.<br>
Exemplary antisense compounds include DNA or RNA sequences that specifically hybridize to the target nucleic acid, e.g., the mRNA encoding VLA-1. The complementary region can extend for between about 8 to about 80 nucleobases. The compounds can include one or more modified nucleobases. Modified nucleobases may include, e.g., 5-substituted pyrimidines such as 5-iodouracil, 5-iodocytosine, and C5-propynyl pyrimidines such as C5-propynylcytosine and C5-propynyluracil. Other suitable modified nucleobases include N4 —(C1 -C12) alkylaminocytosines and N4,N4 — (Ci -C12) dialkylaminocytosines. Modified nucleobases may also include 7-substituted-8-aza-7-deazapurines and 7-substituted-7-deazapurines such as, for example, 7-iodo-7-deazapurines, 7-cyano-7-deazapurines, 7-aminocarbonyl-7-deazapurines. Examples of these include 6-amino-7-iodo-7-deazapurines, 6-amino-7-cyano-7-deazapurines, 6-amino-7-aminocarbonyl-7-deazapurines, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-7-iodo-7-deazapurines, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-7-cyano-7-deazapurines, and2-amino-6-hydroxy-7-aminocarbonyl-7-deazapurines. Furthermore, N6 —(Ci -C12) alkylaminopurines and N6,N6 —(Ci -C12) dialkylaminopurines, including N6 -methylaminoadenine and N6,N6 -dimethylaminoadenine, are also suitable modified nucleobases. Similarly, other 6-substituted purines including, for example, 6-thioguanine may constitute appropriate modified nucleobases. Other suitable nucleobases include 2-thiouracil, 8-bromoadenine, 8-bromoguanine, 2-fluoroadenine, and 2-fluoroguanine. Derivatives of any of the aforementioned modified nucleobases are also appropriate. Substituents of any of the preceding compounds may include C1 -C30 alkyl, C2 -C30 alkenyl, C2 -C30 alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, halo, amino, amido, nitro, thio, sulfonyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, and the like.<br>
Descriptions of other types of nucleic acid agents are also available. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,987,071;. 5,116,742; and 5,093,246; Woolf et al. (1992) Proc Natl AcadSci USA; Antisense RNA and DNA, D.A. Melton, Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988); 89:7305-9; Haselhoff and Gerlach (1988) Nature 334:585-59; Helene, C. (1991) Anticancer Drug Des. 6:569-84; Helene (1992)Ann. N.Y.Acad. Sci. 660:27-36; and Maher (1992) Bioassays 14:807-15.<br>
The nucleic acids described herein, e.g., an anti-sense nucleic acid described herein, can be incorporated into a gene construct to be used as a part of a gene therapy protocol to deliver nucleic acids that can be used to express and produce agents, e.g., anti-sense nucleic acids within cells. Expression constructs of such components may be administered in any biologically effective carrier, e.g. any formulation or composition capable of effectively delivering the component gene to cells in vivo. Approaches include insertion of the subject gene in viral vectors including recombinant retroviruses, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, and herpes simplex virus-1, or recombinant bacterial or eukaryotic plasmids. Viral vectors transfect cells directly; plasmid DNA can be delivered with the help of, for example, cationic liposomes (lipofectin) or derivatized (e.g., antibody conjugated), polylysine conjugates, gramacidin S, artificial viral envelopes or other such intracellular carriers, as well as direct injection of the gene construct or CaPO4 precipitation carried out in vivo.<br>
A preferred approach for in vivo introduction of nucleic acid into a cell is by use of a viral vector containing nucleic acid, e.g. a cDNA. Infection of cells with a viral vector has the advantage that a large proportion of the targeted cells can receive the nucleic acid. Additionally, molecules encoded within the viral vector, e.g., by a cDNA contained in the viral vector, are expressed efficiently in cells which have taken up viral vector nucleic acid.<br>
Retrovirus vectors and adeno-associated virus vectors can be used as a recombinant gene delivery system for the transfer of exogenous genes in vivo, particularly into humans. These vectors provide efficient delivery of genes into cells, and the transferred nucleic acids are stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the host. Protocols for producing recombinant retroviruses and for infecting cells in vitro or in vivo with such viruses can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, F.M. et al. (eds.) Greene Publishing Associates, (1989), Sections 9.10-9.14 and other standard laboratory manuals. Examples of suitable retroviruses include pLJ, pZIP, pWE and pEM which are known to those skilled in the art. Examples of suitable packaging virus lines for preparing both ecotropic and amphotropic retroviral systems include Crip, FCre, ¥2 and Am. Retroviruses have been used to introduce a variety of genes into many different cell types, including epithelial cells, in vitro and/or in vivo (see for example Eglitis et al. (1985) Science 230:1395-1398; Danos and Mulligan (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:6460-6464; Wilson et al. (1988) Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3014-3018; Armentano et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6141-6145; Huber et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8039-8043; Ferry et al (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8377-8381; Chowdhury et al. (1991) Science 254:1802-1805; van Beusechem et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7640-7644; Kay et al (1992) Human Gene Therapy 3:641-647; Dai et al (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10892-10895; Uwuetal. (1993) J. Immunol 150:4104-4115; U.S. Patent Nos. 4,868,116 and 4,980,286; PCX Application WO 89/07136; PCX Application WO 89/02468; PCX Application WO 89/05345; and PCX Application WO 92/07573).<br>
Another viral gene delivery system utilizes adenovirus-derived vectors. See, for example, Berkner et al. (1988) BioTechniques 6:616; Rosenfeld et al (1991) Science 252:431-434; and Rosenfeld et al. (1992) Cell 68:143-155. Suitable adenoviral vectors derived from the adenovirus strain Ad type 5 dl324 or other strains of adenovirus (e.g., Ad2, Ad3, Ad7 etc.) are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Yet another viral vector system useful for delivery of the subject gene is the adeno-associated virus (AAV). See, for example, Flotte et al. (1992) Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 7:349-356; Samulski et al. (1989) J. Virol. 63:3822-3828; and McLaughlin et al. (1989) J. Virol 62:1963-1973.<br>
Aptgmers<br>
Aptamers are short oligonucleotide sequences that can be used to recognize and specifically bind almost any molecule, including cell surface proteins. Xhe systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process is powerful and can be used to readily identify such aptamers. Aptamers can be made for a wide range of proteins of importance for therapy and diagnostics, such as growth factors and cell surface antigens. Xhese oligonucleotides bind their targets with similar affinities and specificities as antibodies do (see Ulrich (2006) Handb Exp Pharmacol. 173:305-26). Macugen® is an approved aptamer therapeutic which is also the first anti-angiogenic agent approved for a common eye disorder.<br>
Artificial transcription factors<br>
Artificial transcription factors can also be used to regulate expression of VLA-1. Xhe artificial transcription factor can be designed or selected from a library, e.g., for<br>
ability to bind to a sequence in an endogenous gene encoding VLA-1, e.g., in a regulatory region, e.g., the promoter. For example, the artificial transcription factor can be prepared by selection in vitro (e.g., using phage display, U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,261) or in vivo, or by design based on a recognition code (see, e.g., WO 00/42219 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,808). See, e.g., Rebar etal. (1996) Methods Enzymol 267:129; Greisman and Pabo (1997) Science 275:657; Isalan et al. (2001) Nat. Biotechnol 19:656; and Wu et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:344 for, among other things, methods for creating libraries of varied zinc finger domains.<br>
Optionally, an artificial transcription factor can be fused to a transcriptional regulatory domain, e.g., an activation domain to activate transcription or a repression domain to repress transcription. In particular, repression domains can be used to decrease expression of endogenous genes encoding VLA-1. The artificial transcription factor can itself be encoded by a heterologous nucleic acid that is delivered to a cell or the protein itself can be delivered to a cell (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,261). The heterologous nucleic acid that includes a sequence encoding the artificial transcription factor can be operably linked to an inducible promoter, e.g., to enable fine control of the level of the artificial transcription factor in the cell, e.g., a neuronal or glial cells, e.g., at or near a site of stroke injury or another injury described herein.<br>
Ischemic Injuries<br>
Ischemia refers to a reduction or abolition of blood supply to a tissue. The methods described herein can be used to treat injuries associated with ischemia, or "ischemic injuries". Ischemic injuries can include injuries to, e.g., the kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, skeletal muscle, intestines, heart and brain. Ischemic injuries can be associated with or caused by, e.g., acute myocardial infarction, elective angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, surgery involving cardiac bypass or organ or tissue transplantation (e.g., cardiac transplantation), tissue rejection after transplantation, graft versus host disease, stroke, head trauma, drowning, sepsis, cardiac arrest, shock, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cocaine-induced heart disease, smoking-induced heart disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, hemorrhage, capillary leak syndrome (such as child and adult respiratory distress syndrome), multi-organ system failure, a state of low colloid oncotic pressure (such as starvation, anorexia nervosa, or hepatic failure with decreased production of serum proteins), anaphylaxis, hypothermia, cold<br>
injury (e.g., due to hypothermic perfusion or frostbite) hepatorenal syndrome, delirium tremens, a crush injury, mesenteric insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, burn, electrocution, excessive drug-induced vasodilation, excessive drug-induced vasoconstriction, radiation exposure (e.g., during fluoroscopy or radiographic imaging), or exposure to high energy, e.g., exposure to laser light. Excessive drug-induced vasodilation can be caused by, for instance, nitroprusside, hydralazone, dyazoxide, a calcium channel blocker, or a general anesthetic. Excessive drug-induced vasoconstriction can be caused by, for instance, neosynephrine, isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, or cocaine.<br>
Ischemia-reperfusion injury<br>
"Ischemia-reperfusion injury" refers to an injury that results from the re-establishment (reperfusion) of the flow of blood to a region of the body following a temporary halt in the flow. For example, ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur during certain surgical procedures, such as repair of aortic aneurysms and organ transplantation. Clinically, ischemia-reperfusion injury can be manifested by complications such as, e.g., pulmonary dysfunction, including adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal dysfunction, consumptive coagulopathies including thrombocytopenia, fibrin deposition into the microvasculature and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, transient and permanent spinal cord injury, cardiac arrhythmias and acute ischemic events, hepatic dysfunction including acute hepatocellular damage and necrosis, gastrointestinal dysfunction including hemorrhage and/or infarction and multisystem organ dysfunction (MSOD) or acute systemic inflammatory distress syndromes (SIRS). The injury may occur in the parts of the body to which the blood supply was interrupted, or it can occur in parts fully supplied with blood during the period of ischemia.<br>
Stroke<br>
Stroke is a general term for acute brain damage resulting from disease or injury of blood vessels. Stroke can be classified into at least two main categories: hemorrhagic stroke (resulting from leakage of blood outside of the normal blood vessels) and ischemic stroke (cerebral ischemia due to lack of blood supply). Some<br>
events that can cause ischemic stroke include thrombosis, embolism, and systemic hypoperfusion (with resultant ischemia and hypoxia).<br>
Stroke generally causes neuronal death and injury in the brain by oxygen deprivation and secondary events. The area of the brain that dies as a result of the lack of blood supply or other damage is called an infarct. In some cases, the treatments described herein can be used to reduce or minimize the size of an infarct, e.g., by reducing secondary events that cause neuronal death or injury.<br>
Obstruction of a cerebral artery resulting from a thrombus which has built up on the wall of a brain artery is generally called cerebral thrombosis. In cerebral embolism, the occlusive material blocking the cerebral artery arises downstream in the circulation (e.g., an embolus is carried to the cerebral artery from the heart). Because it is difficult to discern whether a stroke is caused by thrombosis or embolism, the term thromboembolism is used to cover both these types of stroke. Systemic hypoperfusion may arise as a consequence of decreased blood levels, reduced hematocrit, low blood pressure or inability of the heart to pump blood adequately.<br>
Thrombolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), have been used in the treatment of thromboembolic stroke. These molecules function by lysing the thrombus causing the ischemia. Such drugs are believed to be most useful if administered as soon as possible after acute stroke (preferably within 3 hours) in order to at least partially restore cerebral blood flow in the ischemic region and to sustain neuronal viability. A VLA-1 antagonist can be used, instead of or in combination with, such thrombolytic agents, to achieve a therapeutic benefit in a subject who has experienced a thromboembolic stroke.<br>
Because thrombolytic agents exacerbate bleeding, their use in hemorrhagic stroke is contra-indicated. However, a VLA-1 antagonist can be used to provide therapeutic benefit in cases of hemorrhagic stroke.<br>
Further, a VLA-1 antagonist can be administered as a prophylactic stroke therapy, or as a component thereof, e.g., to a subject who has experienced a TIA or is exhibiting symptoms of TIA. When symptoms of stroke last fewer than 24 hours and the subject recovers completely, the subject is said to have undergone a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The symptoms of TIA include a temporary impairment of speech, vision, sensation, or movement. Because a TIA is often thought to be a prelude to full-scale stroke, subjects having suffered a TIA are candidates for prophylactic<br>
stroke therapy, e.g., with a VLA-1 antagonist alone or in combination with another agent, e.g., an anticoagulation agent (e.g., coumarin and heparin) or an antiplatelet agent (such as aspirin and ticlopidine).<br>
Other stroke treatments<br>
A stroke treatment can involve the use of one or more VLA-1 antagonists that can be used in combination with one or more stroke treatments. The treatments can be administered at the same time, but also at separate times, e.g., at separate times that are within a specified interval, e.g., within the same 48, 24, 12, 6, 2, or 1 hour. Furthermore, the treatments can be using distinct modes of administration.<br>
Treatments that can be administered in combination with a VLA-1 antagonist include: a thrombolytic agent (e.g., streptokinase, acylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), urokinase, single-chain urokinase-plasminogen activator (scu-PA), anti-inflammatory agents, thrombin-like enzymes from snake venoms such as ancrod, thrombin inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and biologically active variants of each of the above); an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin or heparin); antiplatelet drug (e.g., aspirin); a glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitor; a glycosaminoglycan; coumarin; GCSF; melatonin; a caspase inhibitor; an anti-oxidants (e.g., NXY-059, see Lees et al., (2006) N. Engl. J. Med 354, 588-600), a neuroprotectant (e.g., an NMDAreceptor antagonist and a cannabinoid antagonist), an anti-CD 18 antibody; an anti-CD 1 la antibody; an anti-ICAM-1 antibody; an anti-VLA-4 antibody, an anti-TWEAK antibody, an anti-TWEAK-R antibody, carotid endarterectomy; angioplasty; insertion of a stent; and an alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, meditation, massage, hyperbaric oxygen treatment, or conductive pedagogy).<br>
Particular examples of combination treatments include administering a VLA-1 antagonist to a subject who has experienced a stroke shortly after the onset of stroke symptoms and at the same time as another treatment, such as t-PA. The following day, the subject can further commence daily treatments with an anti-platelet drug to protect against a future stroke and later receive additional doses of the VLA-1 antagonist, to maintain bioavailability of the VLA-1 antagonist. As another example, a subject who has experienced a TIA may begin VLA-1 antagonist treatment immediately after diagnosis of the TIA at a dose that provides a biological effect for at least a week, and then begin anti-platelet therapy the following day.<br>
Stroke risk factors<br>
Risk factors for stroke can be used to identify a subject who can be provided with a prophylactic dose of a VLA-1 antagonist or who should be monitored for further signs that treatment with a VLA-1 antagonist is required. In some cases, the subject is treated if the subject has two, three, or four or more of risk factors, e.g., factors listed below.<br>
High blood pressure: High blood pressure (140/90 mm Hg or higher) is a highly significant risk factor for stroke.<br>
Tobacco use: Cigarette smoking is a major, preventable risk factor for stroke. The nicotine and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood. They also damage the walls of blood vessels, making clots more likely to form. Using some kinds of birth control pills combined with smoking cigarettes greatly increases stroke risk.<br>
Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes is defined as a fasting plasma glucose (blood sugar) of 126 mg/dL or more measured on two occasions. While diabetes is treatable, having it still increases a person's risk of stroke. Many people with diabetes also have high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and are overweight. These additional factors further increase risk of stroke.<br>
Carotid or other artery disease: The carotid arteries in the neck supply blood to your brain. A carotid artery narrowed by fatty deposits from atherosclerosis (plaque buildups in artery walls) may become blocked by a blood clot. Carotid artery disease is also called carotid artery stenosis.<br>
Peripheral artery disease: Subjects with peripheral artery disease have a higher risk of carotid artery disease, which raises their risk of stroke. Peripheral artery disease is the narrowing of blood vessels carrying blood to leg and arm muscles. It is caused by fatty buildups of plaque in artery walls.<br>
Atrial fibrillation raises the risk for stroke. The upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of beating effectively, which can let the blood pool and clot. If a clot breaks off, enters the bloodstream and lodges in an artery leading to the brain, a stroke results.<br>
Other heart disease: Subjects with coronary heart disease or heart failure have a higher risk of stroke than those with hearts that work normally. Dilated<br>
cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart), heart valve disease and some types of congenital heart defects also raise the risk of stroke.<br>
Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs): TIAs are "warning strokes" that produce stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage. Recognizing and treating TIAs can reduce the risk of a major stroke.<br>
Certain blood disorders: A high red blood cell count thickens the blood and makes clots more likely. This raises the risk of stroke. Sickle cell disease (also called sickle cell anemia) is a genetic disorder that mainly affects African Americans. "Sickled" red blood cells are less able to carry oxygen to the body's tissues and organs and tend to stick to blood vessel walls, which can block arteries to the brain and cause a stroke.<br>
High blood cholesterol: A high level of total cholesterol in the blood (240 mg/dL or higher) is a major risk factor for heart disease, which raises the risk of stroke. High levels of LDL cholesterol (greater than 100 mg/dL) and triglycerides (blood fats, 150 mg/dL or higher) increase the risk of stroke in people with previous coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TLA). Low levels (less than 40 mg/dL) of HDL cholesterol also may raise stroke risk.<br>
Physical inactivity and obesity: Being inactive, obese, or both can increase the risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.<br>
Excessive substance abuse: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and intravenous drug use can also increase risk for stroke.<br>
Increasing age: Although subjects of all ages, including children, have strokes, the older the subject is, the greater the risk for stroke. For example, risk can be much greater over the age of 55, 60, 70, 80, or 85.<br>
Sex (gender): Stroke is more common in men than in women. In most age groups, more men than women will have a stroke in a given year. However, women account for more than half of all stroke deaths. Women who are pregnant have a higher stroke risk.<br>
Heredity (family history): The stroke risk is greater if a parent, grandparent, sister, or brother has had a stroke. Similarly, certain ethnic backgrounds can lead to an increased risk for stroke.<br>
Prior stroke or heart attack: A subject who has had a stroke or a heart attack is at much higher risk of subsequently having a stroke.<br>
Stroke assessment criteria<br>
The ability of a VLA-1 antagonist to treat a subject having or at risk for stroke can be evaluated, subjectively or objectively, e.g., using a variety of criteria. A number of assessment tools are available to provide the evaluation.<br>
Exemplary prehospital stroke assessment tools include the Cincinnati Stroke Scale and the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS). Acute assessment scales include, e.g., the Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Hempispheric Stroke Scale, the Hunt &amp; Hess Scale, the Mathew Stroke Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Orgogozo Stroke Scale, the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project Classification (Bamford), and the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Functional assessment scales include the Berg Balance Scale, the Modified Rankin Scale, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Measure (SS-QOL). Outcome assessment tools include the American Heart Association Stroke Outcome Classification (AHA SOC), the Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM™), the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and the Health Survey SF-36™ &amp; SF-12™. Other diagnostic and screening tests include the Action Research Arm Test, the Blessed-Dementia Scale, the Blessed-Dementia Information-Memory-Concentration Test, the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia, the Hachinkski Ischaemia Score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the NINDS - AIREN criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia, the Orpington Prognostic Score, the Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, the Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction grading scheme, MRI imaging (e.g., diffusion and perfusion imaging techniques (Henninger et al., Stroke 37:1283-1287, 2006), diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI techniques, and flow-sensitive imaging, e.g., fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)), functional and spectroscopical imaging (Koroshetz, Ann. Neurol. 39:283-284, 1996), and PET (Heiss et al., Cerebrovasc. Brain Metab. Rev. 5:235-263, 1993), and.<br>
An evaluation can be performed before and/or after the administration of a VLA-1 antagonist.<br>
Traumatic brain injury<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist described herein can be used to treat traumatic brain injury. Damage to the brain by a physical force is broadly termed traumatic brain injury (TBI). The resulting effect of TBI causes alteration of normal brain processes attributable to changes in brain structure and/or function. There are two basic types of brain injury, open head injury and closed head injury. In an open head injury, an object, such as a bullet, penetrates the skull and damages the brain tissue. Closed head injury is usually caused by a rapid movement of the head during which the brain is whipped back and forth, bouncing off the inside of the skull. Closed head injuries are the most common of the two, which often result from accidents involving motor vehicles or falls. In a closed head injury, brute force or forceful shaking injures the brain. The stress of this rapid movement pulls apart and stretches nerve fibers or axons, breaking connections between different parts of the brain. In most cases, a resulting blood clot, or hematoma, may push on the brain or around it, raising the pressure inside the head. Both open and closed head injuries can cause severe damage to the brain, resulting in the need for immediate medical attention.<br>
Depending on the type of force that hits the head, varying injuries such as any of the following can result: jarring of the brain within the skull, concussion, skull fracture, contusion, subdural hematoma, or diffuse axonal injury. Though each person's experience is different, there are common problems that many people with TBI face. Possibilities documented include difficulty in concentrating, ineffective problem solving, short and long-term memory problems, and impaired motor or sensory skills; to the point of an inability to perform daily living skills independently such as eating, dressing or bathing. The most widely accepted concept of brain injury divides the process into primary and secondary events. Primary brain injury is considered to be more or less complete at the time of impact, while secondary injury evolves over a period of hours to days following trauma.<br>
Primary injuries are those commonly associated with emergency situations such as auto accidents, or anything causing temporary loss of consciousness or fracturing of the skull. Contusions, or bruise-like injuries, often occur under the location of a particular impact. The shifting and rotating of the brain inside the skull after a closed brain injury results in shearing injury to the brain's long connecting nerve fibers or axons, which is referred to as diffuse axonal injury. Lacerations are defined as the tearing of frontal and temporal lobes or blood vessels caused by the brain rotating<br>
across ridges inside the skull. Hematomas, or blood clots, result when small vessels are broken by the injury. They can occur between the skull and the brain (epidural or subdural hematoma), or inside the substance of the brain itself (intracerebral hematoma). In either case, if they are sufficiently large they will compress or shift the brain, damaging sensitive structures within the brain stem. They can also raise the pressure inside the skull and eventually shut off the blood supply to the brain.<br>
Delayed secondary injury at the cellular level has come to be recognized as a major contributor to the ultimate tissue loss that occurs after brain injury. A cascade of physiologic, vascular, and biochemical events is set in motion in injured tissue. This process involves a multitude of systems, including possible changes in neuropeptides, electrolytes such as calcium and magnesium, excitatory amino acids, arachidonic acid metabolites such as the prostagladins and leukotrienes, and the formation of oxygen free radicals. This secondary tissue damage is at the root of most of the severe, long-term adverse effects a person with brain injury may experience. Procedures that minimize this damage can be the difference between recovery to a normal or near-normal condition, or permanent disability.<br>
Diffuse blood vessel damage has been increasingly implicated as a major component of brain injury. The vascular response seems to be biphasic. Depending on the severity of the trauma, early changes include an initial rise in blood pressure, an early loss of the automatic regulation of cerebral blood vessels, and a transient breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Vascular changes peak at approximately six hours post-injury but can persist for as long as six days. The clinical significance of these blood vessels changes is still unclear, but may relate to delayed brain swelling that is often seen, especially in younger people.<br>
The process by which brain contusions produce brain necrosis is equally complex and is also prolonged over a period of hours. Toxic processes include the release of oxygen free radicals, damage to cell membranes, opening of ion channels to an influx of calcium, release of cytokines, and metabolism of free fatty acids into highly reactive substances that may cause vascular spasm and ischemia. Free radicals are formed at some point in almost every mechanism of secondary injury. The primary target of the free radicals are the fatty acids of the cell membrane. A process known as lipid peroxidation damages neuronal, glial, and vascular cell membranes in a geometrically progressing fashion. If unchecked, lipid peroxidation spreads over the<br>
surface of the cell membrane and eventually leads to cell death. Thus, free radicals damage endothelial cells, disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and directly injure brain cells, causing edema and structural changes in neurons and glia. Disruption of the BBB is responsible for brain edema and exposure of brain cells to damaging blood-borne products.<br>
Secondary systemic insults (outside the brain) may consequently lead to further damage to the brain. This is extremely common after brain injuries of all grades of severity, particularly if they are associated with multiple injuries. Thus, people with brain injury may experience combinations of low blood oxygen, blood pressure, heart and lung changes, fever, blood coagulation disorders, and other adverse changes at recurrent intervals in the days following brain injury. These occur at a time when the normal regulatory mechanism, by which the cerebralvascular vessels can relax to maintain an adequate supply of oxygen and blood during such adverse events, is impaired as a result of the original trauma.<br>
The protocols for immediate assessment are limited in their efficiency and reliability and are often invasive. Computer-assisted tomographic (CT) scanning is currently accepted as the standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating TBI, as it can identify many abnormalities associated with primary brain injury, is widely available, and can be performed at a relatively low cost (Marik et al. Chest 122:688-711 2002; McAllister et al. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology 23:775-791 2001). However, the use of CT scanning in the diagnosis and management of patients presenting to emergency departments with TBI can vary among institutions, and CT scan results themselves may be poor predictors of neuropsychiatric outcome in TBI subjects, especially in the case of mild TBI injury (McCullagh et al. Brain Injury 15:489-497 2001).<br>
Immediate treatment for TBI typically involves surgery to control bleeding in and around the brain, monitoring and controlling intracranial pressure, insuring adequate blood flow to the brain, and treating the body for other injuries and infection. Those with mild brain injuries often experience subtle symptoms and may defer treatment for days or even weeks. Once a patient chooses to seek medical attention, observation, neurological testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scan, monitoring the level of a neurotransmitter in spinal fluid, computed tomography (CT)<br>
scans, and X-rays may be used to determine the extent of the patient's injury. The type and severity of the injury determine further care.<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist can be used, alone or in combination with another treatment, to achieve a therapeutic benefit in a subject who has experienced a TBI. Further, a VLA-1 antagonist can be administered as a prophylactic TBI therapy, or as a component thereof, e.g., to a subject who has experienced a TBI or is exhibiting symptoms of a TBI. For example, a VLA-1 antagonist can be used to treat a primary injury, a secondary injury, or both. Alternatively, a VLA-1 antagonist can be used to treat a primary injury and as a prophylactic therapy for a secondary injury. An evaluation can be performed before and/or after the administration of a VLA-1 antagonist.<br>
Spinal cord injury<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist described herein can be used to treat spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an insult to the spinal cord resulting in a change, either temporary or permanent, in its normal motor, sensory, or autonomic function. Both clinical and experimental studies evidence that the spinal cord suffers from primary and secondary damage after acute SCI. Primary SCI arises from mechanical disruption, transection, extradural pathology, or distraction of neural elements. This injury usually occurs with fracture and/or dislocation of the spine. However, primary SCI may occur in the absence of spinal fracture or dislocation. Penetrating injuries due to bullets or weapons may also cause primary SCI (Burney et al., Arch Surg 128(5): 596-9 (1993)). More commonly, displaced bone fragments cause penetrating spinal cord or segmental spinal nerve injuries. Extradural pathology may also cause primary SCI. Spinal epidural hematomas or abscesses cause acute cord compression and injury. Spinal cord compression from metastatic disease is a common oncologic emergency. Longitudinal distraction with or without flexion and/or extension of the vertebral column may result in primary SCI without spinal fracture or dislocation. A VLA-1 antagonist can be used to treat a primary spinal injury.<br>
The pathophysiology of secondary SCI involves a multitude of cellular and molecular events that progress over the first few days after injury (Tator, Brain Pathology 5:407-413 (1995)). The most important cause of secondary SCI is vascular injury to the spinal cord caused by arterial disruption, arterial thrombosis, and<br>
hypoperfusion due to shock. SCI can be sustained through ischemia from damage or impingement on the spinal arteries. SCI due to ischemia can occur during surgery where aortic blood flow is temporarily stopped. A VLA-1 antagonist described herein can be used to treat or prevent secondary SCI injury.<br>
Spinal cord injury can also be caused by toxicity (Tator, Brain Pathology 5:407-413 (1995)). One of the most compelling toxicity in spinal cord injury is the accumulation and subsequent damage exerted by the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter. Glutamate induced excitotoxicity causes an elevation of intracellular calcium. Raised intracellular calcium can in turn cause activation of calcium dependent proteases or lipases which cause further damage due to breakdown of cytoskeletal components including neurofilaments and dissolution of cell membranes. The excess production of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids such as prostaglandins may be related to lipid peroxidation and oxygen free radicals. The release of vasoactive eicosanoids from damaged neuronal membranes may in turn cause progressive posttraumatic ischemia by inducing vasospasm. Endogenous opioids may also be involved in the secondary injury process either by their effects on the local or systemic circulation or by direct effects on the injured cord. A VLA-1 antagonist described herein can be used to treat or prevent spinal cord injury resulting from toxicity.<br>
Significant and progressive edema can follow spinal cord injury. It is not known whether the edema is injurious in itself or whether it is an epiphenomenon of another injury mechanism such as ischemia or glutamate toxicity. Edema can spread in the cord from the site of injury for a considerable distance rostrally and caudally in both experimental models and clinical cases.<br>
SCI are classified as complete or incomplete, based on the extent of injury, according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale. In complete SCI, there is no sensory and motor function preserved in the lowest sacral segments (Waters et al., Paraplegia 29(9): 573-81(1991)). In incomplete SCI, sensory or motor function is preserved below the level of injury including the lowest sacral segments (Waters et al., Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 75(3): 306-11 (1994)). Incomplete cord lesions may evolve into more complete lesions. More commonly, the injury level rises one or two spinal levels during the hours to days after the initial event.<br>
Other classifications of SCI include central cord syndrome, Brown-Sequard syndrome, anterior cord syndrome, conus medullaris syndrome and cauda equina syndrome. Central cord syndrome is often associated with a cervical region injury leading to greater weakness in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs with sacral sensory sparing. Brown-Sequard syndrome involves a hemisection lesion of the cord, causing a relatively greater ipsilateral proprioceptive and motor loss with contralateral loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature. Anterior cord syndrome is often associated with a lesion causing variable loss of motor function and sensitivity to pain and temperature, while proprioception is preserved. Conus medullaris syndrome is associated with injury to the sacral cord and lumbar nerve roots. This syndrome is characterized by areflexia in the bladder, bowel, and lower limbs, while the sacral segments occasionally may show preserved reflexes (e.g., bulbocavernosus and micturition reflexes). Cauda equina syndrome is due to injury to the lumbosacral nerve roots in the spinal canal, leading to areflexic bladder, bowel, and lower limbs.<br>
Neurogenic shock can result from SCI (Tator, Brain Pathology 5:407-413 (1995)). Neurogenic shock refers to the hemodynamic triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and peripheral vasodilation resulting from autonomic dysfunction and the interruption of sympathetic nervous system control in acute SCI, and is differentiated from spinal and hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock tends to be associated with tachycardia. Spinal shock is defined as the complete loss of all neurologic function, including reflexes and rectal tone, below a specific level that is associated with autonomic dysfunction. An initial increase in blood pressure is noted due to the release of catecholamines, followed by hypotension. Flaccid paralysis, including of the bowel and bladder, is observed, and sometimes sustained priapism develops. These symptoms tend to last several hours to days until the reflex arcs below the level of the injury begin to function again.<br>
Current therapy for SCI aims to improve motor function and sensation in patients with the disorder. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone are thought to reduce the secondary effects of acute SCI, and the use of high-dose methylprednisolone in nonpenetrating acute SCI has become the standard of care in North America.<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist described herein can be used to treat any classification of SCI, or a symptom thereof, as described herein. A VLA-1 antagonist can be used alone or in combination with another known therapy for SCI.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., for administration to a subject to treat stroke, TBI or SCI. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. The composition can include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., an acid addition salt or a base addition salt (see e.g., Berge, S.M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19).<br>
The VLA-1 antagonist can be formulated according to standard methods. Pharmaceutical formulation is a well-established art, and is further described, e.g., in Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20* ed., Lippincott.. Williams &amp; Wilkins (2000) (ISBN: 0683306472); Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Publishers (1999) (ISBN: 0683305727); and Kibbe (ed.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients American Pharmaceutical Association, 3rd ed. (2000) (ISBN: 091733096X).<br>
In one embodiment, a VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be formulated with excipient materials, such as sodium chloride, sodium dibasic phosphate heptahydrate, sodium monobasic phosphate, and a stabilizer. It can be provided, for example, in a buffered solution at a suitable concentration and can be stored at 2-8°C.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form can depend on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typically compositions for the agents described herein are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions.<br>
Such compositions can be administered by a parenteral mode (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular injection). The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein mean modes of<br>
administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and include, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural, intracerebral, intracranial, intracarotid and intrasternal injection and infusion.<br>
The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable for stable storage at high concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an agent described herein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating an agent described herein into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of an agent described herein plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.<br>
In certain embodiments, the VLA-1 antagonist may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be modified, e.g., with a moiety that improves its stabilization and/or retention in circulation, e.g., in blood, serum, or other tissues, e.g., by at least 1.5, 2, 5, 10, or 50 fold. The modified<br>
antagonist can be evaluated to assess whether it can reach sites of damage after a stroke, TBI or SCI (e.g., by using a labeled form of the antagonist).<br>
For example, the VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be associated with a polymer, e.g., a substantially non-antigenic polymer, such as a polyalkylene oxide or a polyethylene oxide. Suitable polymers will vary substantially by weight. Polymers having molecular number average weights ranging from about 200 to about 35,000 Daltons (or about 1,000 to about 15,000, and 2,000 to about 12,500) can be used.<br>
For example, a VLA-1 antagonist can be conjugated to a water soluble polymer, e.g., a hydrophilic polyvinyl polymer, e.g. polyvinylalcohol or polyvinylpyrrolidone. A non-limiting list of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained. Additional useful polymers include polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene (Pluronics); polymethacrylates; carbomers; and branched or unbranched polysaccharides.<br>
When the VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) is used in combination with a second agent, the two agents can be formulated separately or together. For example, the respective pharmaceutical compositions can be mixed, e.g., just prior to administration, and administered together or can be administered separately, e.g., at the same or different times.<br>
Administration<br>
A VLA-1 antagonist described herein (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be administered to a subject, e.g., a human subject, by a variety of methods. For many applications, the route of administration is one of: intravenous injection or infusion (IV), subcutaneous injection (SC), intraperitoneally (IP), or intramuscular injection. In some cases, administration may be directly into the CNS, e.g., intrathecal, intracerebroventricular (ICV), intracerebral or intracranial. The antagonist can be administered as a fixed dose, or in a mg/kg dose.<br>
The dose can also be chosen to reduce or avoid production of antibodies against the antagonist.<br>
The route and/or mode of administration of the blocking agent can also be tailored for the individual case, e.g., by monitoring the subject, e.g., using tomographic imaging, neurological exam, and standard parameters associated with stroke, TBI or SCI, e.g., the assessment criteria described herein.<br>
Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the desired response, e.g., a therapeutic response or a combinatorial therapeutic effect. Generally, any combination of doses (either separate or co-formulated) of the VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) (and optionally a second agent) can be used in order to provide a subject with the agent in bioavailable quantities. For example, doses in the range of 0.025 mg/kg -100 mg/kg, 0.05-50 mg/kg, 0.1-30 mg/kg, 0.1-5 mg/kg, or 0.3 - 3 mg/kg can be administered.<br>
Dosage unit form or "fixed dose" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier and optionally in association with the other agent.<br>
The VLA-1 antagonist may be administered at least once between about 10 minutes to about 48 hours, more preferably between about 10 minutes and 24 hours, more preferably within 3 hours, after the onset of stroke symptoms or manifestation, TBI symptoms, or SCI symptoms. Single or multiple dosages may be given. Alternatively, or in addition, the antagonist may be administered via continuous infusion. The treatment can continue for days, weeks, months or even years so as to minimize ischemic damage from the stroke, to minimize damage from post-stroke inflammatory events, to prevent another stroke or to minimize damage that might result from a subsequent stroke, to treat primary or secondary TBI or symptoms, or to treat primary or secondary SCI or symptoms.<br>
For example, if a subject is at risk for stroke or has suffered a TIA, the antagonist can be administered before the onset of a stroke as a preventative measure. The duration of such preventative treatment can be a single dosage of the antagonist or the treatment may continue (e.g., multiple dosages), for example, a subject at risk for stroke may be treated with the antagonist for days, weeks, months, or even years so as to prevent a stroke from occurring.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition may include a therapeutically effective amount of an antagonist described herein. Such effective amounts can be determined based on the effect of the administered antagonist, or the combinatorial effect of an antagonist and secondary agent if more than one agent is used. A therapeutically effective amount of an antagonist may also vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual, e.g., amelioration of at least one disorder parameter, e.g., a stroke, TBI or SCI parameter, or amelioration of at least one symptom of the disorder, e.g., stroke, TBI or SCI. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition is outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.<br>
Devices and Kits<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions that include a VLA-1 antagonist (e.g., an anti-VLA-1 antibody) can be administered with a medical device. The device can designed with features such as portability, room temperature storage, and ease of use so that it can be used in emergency situations, e.g., by an untrained subject or by emergency personnel in the field, removed to medical facilities and other medical equipment.

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Effects of anti-VLA-1 antibody on focal cerebral ischemia<br>
Protocol<br>
Female C57B6 mice weighing 18-20g from Charles River Lab were used for this study. Animals were grouped into 2 experimental groups outlined by the following conditions.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Following intraperitoneal injection of murine Ha31/8 or PI. 17, mice were anaesthetized initially with 2% isofurane and thereafter maintained in 1.0% isofurane in O2, delivered through a face-mask. Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.8 and 37.2 °C using a feedback-regulated heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Inc.<br>
Holliston, MA). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored using a PeriFlux System (Perimed Inc., Sweden) before and during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and after reperfusion.<br>
To induce focal cerebral ischemia with reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a 7.0 nylon monofilament suture coated with a silicone/hardener mixture (Heraeus Kulzer, Germany) was inserted into the lumen of the right common carotid artery. The suture was advanced 9±1.0 mm from the insertion site through the internal carotid artery until the proximal portion of the anterior cerebral artery, completely occluding the MCA at its origin. Laser Doppler flowmetry measurement of rCBF indicated that the MCA occlusion was successful in both groups because the rCBF dropped to 20% of base line. MCAO lasted two hours; meanwhile, the wound was closed and anesthesia was discontinued. After 2 hours MCA occlusion, the filament was taken out and mice were reperfused for 24 hours. Whether rCBF remained on the previous level was determined. Four animals were excluded from this study because rCBF was found increasing back to more than 50% of previous level 2 hours after MCAO and before reperfusion. All physiologic parameters before, during, and after ischemia were within the normal range and did not differ between groups.<br>
Neurologic deficits were assessed and scored on 30 minutes after MCAO and 24 hours after reperfusion respectively in the open filed.   The test was described by Haraetal(1997):<br>
0,	no observable neurologic deficit    (normal),<br>
1,	failure to extent right forepaw       (mild);<br>
2,	circling to the contralateral side     (moderate);<br>
3,	loss of walking or right reflex	(severe).<br>
The volume of ischemic lesion after MCA occlusion was measured in both groups. The mice were sacrificed by decapitation after 24 hours of reperfusion following 2 hours of MCAO, and brains were rapid removed and sliced into 6 1 -mm thick coronal sections using a mouse brain matrix. The brain sections were then stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight. Brain slices were directly scanned on an image scanner. The lesion was measured on the posterior<br>
surface of each section (NIH Image 1.61, US National Institutes of Health). A direct measurement of infarct area in the cortex and striatum was carried out, which was then corrected to eliminate the effect of edema using the following formula:<br>
% indirect infarct area of contralateral cortex =<br>
[(contralateral area - ipsilateral nontraumatic area) / contralateral area] x 100.<br>
The total infarct volume was calculated by numeric integration of the sequential infarct areas including both the cortex and striatum. Measurements were made after the sections were coded so that the observer was blinded with respect to the previous treatment. Edema was quantified as the % increase in the ischemic hemisphere size compared to the contralateral uninjured hemisphere.<br>
Results<br>
Control antibody-treated mice that underwent MCAO sustained extensive lesions throughout the cortical and subcortical regions of the brain. The ischemic hemisphere was markedly swollen and significant behavioral deficits were observed (e.g., hemiparesis resulting in rotation and limb weakness; see Figure 1 A).<br>
Mice treated with control antibody (PI. 17) sustained infarcts spanning 47.1 ± 3.8% of the ischemic hemisphere. Mice treated with anti-VLA-1 antibody sustained significantly smaller infarcts spanning only 34.3 ± 4.2% of the ischemic hemisphere (P 
■J<br>
of 55.63 ± 6.3mm (Figure 1C). Brain swelling or edema was calculated as the percentage increase in hemisphere size of the infarcted hemisphere compared to the undamaged contra-lateral hemisphere. Control (P1.17) - treated mice sustained a mean increase in hemisphere size of 18.1 ± % compared to anti-VLA-1 (Ha/31/8) - treated mice that sustained an increase in hemisphere size of 8.2% ± 1.9% (P
mg/kg of the antibody was as effective as 30 mg/kg in reducing both infarct volume (Fig. 2A) and edema (Fig. 2B).<br>
These data demonstrate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of inhibition of VLA-1 in a model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse. The pathology of this model is clinically representative of the human condition of stroke and other CNS ischemic injuries such as TBI and SCI, and the present data suggest that inhibitors of VLA-1 may be of significant benefit in the treatment of these and other ischemia related disorders.<br>
