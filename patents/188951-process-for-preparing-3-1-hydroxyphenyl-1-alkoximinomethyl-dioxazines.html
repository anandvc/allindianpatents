				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl- 1 -alkoximinomethyl)dioxazines which are known as intermediates for preparing compounds having fungicidal properties (WO 95-04728). Furthermore, the invention relates to novel 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazines, to novel intermediates for their-preparation and to a plurality of processes for preparing the novel intermediates.<br>
It has already been disclosed that certain 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)-dioxazines can be prepared starting from the corresponding hydroxyphenyl acetates (cf. WO 95-04728). Thus, for example. (5,6-dihydro[l,4,2]dioxazin-3-yl)-(2-hydroxy- phenl)-methanone-0-methyl. oxime (l) can be prepared by reacting methyl hydroxy-phenylacetate (a) with dihydropyrane, converting the resulting dihydropyranyl ether (b) with t-butyl nitrite into methyl 2-[2-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-phenyl l]-2- hydroximinoacetate (c), alkylating this compound with iodomethane to give methyl 2-[2-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-phenyl]-2-methoximino-acetate (d), reacting this with hydroxylamine to give 2-[2-(tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy)-phenyl]-2-methoximino-N- hydroxyacetamide (e), cyclizing the latter with dibromoethane to give 3-{l-[2-(tetra-hydropyran-2-yloxy)-phenyl]-l-methoximino-methyl}-5, 6-dihydro-l, 4, 2-dioxazine (f), and finally removing the tetrahydropyranyl group using acid catalysis. This synthesis can be illustrated by the following schemes   (Scheme Removed)<br>

In the practice of the processes e), g) and i) according to the invention for preparing the compounds of the formula (V), (VI) and (IX), respectively, in general 1 to 15 mol. preferably 1 to 8 mol, of the alkoxyamine of the formula (VIII) - or an acid addition complex thereof - are employed per mole of the u)-nitro-2-hydroxyacetophenone of the formula (VII), the benzofuranone of the formula (X) and the -halogeno-2-hydroxyacetophenone of the formula (XIII), respectively.<br>

The processes a) to i) according to the invention are generally carried out at atmospheric pressure. However, it is also possible to carry out the processes at elevated or reduced pressure - in general between 0.1 bar and 10 bar.<br>
In a preferred process variant (A), an -nitro-2-hydroxyacetophenone of the formula (VII) is converted into an -nitro-2-hydroxyacetophenone oxime ot the formula (V) by reaction with an alkoxyamine of the formula (VIII) - or an acid addition complex thereof - if appropriate in a buffer system such as, for example, sodium acetate/acetic acid, as described in process e). Compound (V) is reacted with a base, for example an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, to give an O-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (III). The O-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (III) is reacted in basic solution, for example an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution, with an ethane derivative of the formula (IV) to give an O-hydroxyethyl-O'-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (II) which, preferably without   work-up,  reacts  further  in   the  basic  solution  to  give  the  desired   3-(l-<br>
hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazine. This is, if appropriate, isomenzed to the desired E isomer, for example by treatment with an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, in an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
In a further preferred process variant (B), an -halogeno-2-hydroxyacetophenone of the formula (XIII) is converted into an -halogeno-2-hydroxyacetophenone oxime of the formula (IX) by reaction with an alkoxyamine of the formula (VIII) - or an acid addition complex thereof - if appropriate in a buffer system such as, for example, sodium acetate/acetic acid, as described in process i). The compound of the formula (IX) is cyclized by treatment with a base, for example with sodium bicarbonate in the water/methyl t-butyl ether system, to give an O-alkyl-benzofuranone oxime of the formula (VI). On treatment with an alkali metal nitrite or alkyl nitrite in acidic or basic solution, the O-alkyl-benzofuranone oxime of the formula (VI) affords an O-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (III). The O-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (III) is reacted in basic solution, for example an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution, with an ethane derivative of the formula (IV) to give an O-hydroxyethyl-O'-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (II) which, preferably without work-up, reacts further in the basic solution to give the desired 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazine. This is, if appropriate, isomerized to the desired E isomer, for example by treatment with an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, in an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
In a third preferred process variant (C), a benzofuranone of the formula (X) is converted into an O-alkylbenzofuranone oxime of the formula (VI) by reaction with an alkoxyamine of the formula (VIII) - or an acid addition complex thereof if appropriate in a buffer system such as, for example, sodium acetate/acetic acid, as described in process g). On treatment with an alkali metal nitrite or alkyl nitrite in acidic or basic solution, the O-alkyl-benzofuranone oxime of the formula (VI) affords an O-alkyl-benzofuranonedione dioxime of the formula (III). The O-alkyl-benzofurandione dioxime of the formula (III) is reacted in basic solution, for example an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution, with an ethane derivative of the formula (IV)  to  give  an  O-hydroxyethyl-O'-alkyl-benzofurandione  dioxime  of the<br>
formula (II) which, preferably without work-up, reacts further in the basic solution to give the desired 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazine. This is. if appropriate, isomerized to the desired E isomer, for example by treatment with an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, in an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
It is very surprising that the processes according to the invention, in particular when combined, yield high purity products in high yields. It is particularly surprising that compounds of the general formula (V) readily cyclize with elimination of water even in the presence of water at temperatures as low as room temperature on treatment with bases to give high yields of compounds of the formula (III) and can be isolated in high purity simply by filtration. According to the known literature, under these conditions only a deprotonation of the compounds of the formula (V) was to be expected. Furthermore, it is particularly surprising that the compounds of the formula (III) can be reacted with epoxides under alkaline conditions, without any problems, to give compounds of the formula (II) which in turn, if appropriate even without work-up, immediately cyclize to the desired 3-( l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazines. Chem. Ber. 1902, 1640, for example, describes that benzofurandione monooximes are cleaved to give salicylic acid derivatives or hydroxyphenylglyoxalic acid derivatives by treatment both with acids and with bases. Thus, it would have been more likely to expect the compounds of the formula (III) to decompose likewise under the given reaction conditions. The smooth nitrosation of the compounds of the formula (VI) (process d) is also surprising, since a nitrosation of methyl or methylene groups which are located a to oximes, in contrast to methyl or methylene groups which are located a to keto groups, has not been described before.<br>
The processes according to the invention have a number of advantages. Thus, they allow the preparation of a large quantity of 3-(l-hydroxyphenyl-l-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazines in high yields and high purities. It is a further advantage that the ethane derivatives of the formula (IV), the -nitro-2-hydroxyacetophenones of the formula (VII), the benzofuranones of the formula (X), and the -halogeno-2-hydroxyacetophenones of the formula (XIII) required as starting materials are easily obtainable at low cost, even in larger amounts.<br>
