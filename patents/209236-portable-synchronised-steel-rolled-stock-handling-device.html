The present invention relates to a lifting and loading apparatus for handling materials like rails, long bars, rods particularly on and from flat wagons.<br>
Handling of heavy and lengthy materials like the ones named above for transportation purposes is a serious problem as the known procedures are cumbersome, involve large labour power and require extensive planning. In the presently known art, loading of rails on BFR.BRH,BRN wagons are carried out manually requiring extensive labour and man hour. Such manual loading of rails on wagons was thus found to be time consuming and expensive. In addition rails being extremely heavy , handling the same was at time risky and unsafe.<br>
With the advent of high speed vehicles the rails now being used of high ultimate tensile strength welded to make them 260 metres in length, with the crude manner they were being unloaded in-situ would notch the said rails and serious kinks would develop resulting in rail fracture on movement of traffic which while in track would become serious hazard and precious human life was endangered.<br>
 3.<br>
It is also known in the art to have mechanised loading devices by which rails could be loaded in the wagons by mechanised systems. Even use of such known mechanised systems of loading of rails on wagons was unsafe and cumbersome as the device employed was difficult to assemble as it involved complicated operating means.<br>
Furthermore the known mechanised device for loading of rail on wagons was disadvantageous in that the device had means to hold the rail only at a single point or at two points of its entire length and was infringing in nature &amp; accordingly, would drag the rails on the opposite side which was dangerous as far as the safety of the rails and the wagon is concerned. Such dragging infringing movement of the rail during loading increase,the tension of the wire ropes used to load the rail and at times such tension exceeded the stress bearing limit of the wire rope resulting in failure of the total system. Moreover the danger of such dragging of the load horizontally rubbing the side of the wagon would notch the rail which would eventually develop into rail fracture on movement of traffic with consequential danger of serious accidents and loss of valuable life. Moreover these system devices had no means to unload the rails from the wagon.<br>
 4.<br>
For the aforesaid reasons, known system devices used for loading of rail on wagons was found to be expensive (due to involvement of a large labour force) time consuming (due to the requirement of extensive man hours involved in the process) and in addition-was- "unsafe (due to the dragging effect during loading experienced during use of such known mechanised loading systems). Further there was no way that these devices could unload the long members such as rails, long bars, rods, tubes and the like,from the wagons [BRF/BRH,BRN].<br>
Therefore the main obiect of the present invention is to propose an easily assemble able and convenient to operate self-propelled / manual lifting and loading/ unloading apparatus attachable to railway wagons [BFR/BRH] for handling heavy and lengthy loads such as rails, long bars and the like.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a lifting and loading/unloading apparatus for handling of rail on BFR/BRH wagons by which the manpower and man hours involved in such loading/unloading purposes could be reduced to a large extent and handling of rails could be done safely without damaging the rails.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a lifting and loading/unloading apparatus for handling materials like rails, long bars, rods particularly on and from flat wagons comprising:<br>
 5.<br>
a column fixed to the side of the flat railway wagon;<br>
a boom hingably fixed to said column with a pin for vertical up and down movement about said pin; and a wire rope connected at one end of said boom to lift the said boom from transport mode to horizontal/working position;<br>
a trolley comprising a power unit drive gear box wheel barrel drum with hoist wire rope having a rail clamp at the lower end of said hoist wire rope to clamp a rail for stacking on a rail stack;<br>
a platform movable mounted on said boom and fixed to one side of said trolley to house the operator.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the plan view of the apparatus mounted on a flat railway wagon;<br>
Figure  2  shows the  detail of the apparatus  in rest and<br>
working position.<br>
Figure  3  shows the detail of the apparatus in rest and<br>
ready for movement on the train.<br>
 6.<br>
The assembly for mechanised loading &amp; unloading apparatus (10) of heavy material on a load carrying body is directed to serve as an improved system of loading/unloading. The power unit (7) which is preferably a diesel/CNG/LPG petrol kerosene engine of 3 HP or an electric motor connected to power source (Gen set etc) which drives the gear box (8) to obtain an improved input: output power ratio. The power unit (7) can also be operated manually. Gear drive mechanism of the gear box (8) is operatively connected to the planetary/worm wheel gear assembly (not shown) for effecting rotary motion of the said barrel wheel drum (9) provided on top of the trolley (5) which moves on the boom (4) alongwith the power unit (7) so to unwind and rewind the hoist wire rope (18) on the wheel barrel drum (9) for lifting and loading &amp; unloading of the material one after the other on off the load carrying body.<br>
The hoist wire rope (8) originating from the barrel drum (9) wheel unit and having an end connected to the barrel drum wheel are provided at their free end with Clamping device, a rail clamp (13) which are profile contoured to match the rail lead (14) profile as appropriate so as no notch is developed<br>
on the rail surface to grip the material to be loaded/unloaded at its ends for loading purposes.In order to facilitate smooth<br>
transmission of power required to unwind and rewind the wire rope (18), mechanised trolley (5) means are provided to carry the entire loading unit on the boom (4) from one side to the other side of the wagon supported by a wire rope (3) having a pin (16) .<br>
 7.<br>
The boom (4) during its transport mode (12) is inclined and its free end rests on the surface of the flat rail wagon (1). Alternatively the boom (4) is swayed on the same horizontal plane level inside the railway wagon (11) having it pivotted from the column. The boom 4 is movably hinged at the top of said column (2) with a pin 16. A wire rope (3) is attached at the end of said boom (4) and the other end is fixed to the support bracket (19) provided under the flat rail wagon (1). The wire rope (3) is used for lifting the boom (4) from the transport mode (12) to horizontal working position (17) and to hold the same position during the working cycle of the loading/unloading operation. The bracket support means (19) is provided on the opposite side of the material loading side of the wagon (1) .<br>
The boom (4) is extended to cover the width of the load carrying body and plus the space required for free access of the wire rope (18) to the load giving respect to the parameters so as not to infringe the movement of traffic on adajcent track. For loading purposes, the wire ropes are allowed to unwind by operation of the power unit (7) to reach the ground level to grip   the  load material stationed on the ground.    Clamps<br>
(13) provided at the free ends of the at least one rope (18)<br>
originating from the barrel wheel  drum (9) to grip the rail<br>
(14) material at its ends. Subsequently, power unit (7)    is<br>
operated  to  effect  rewinding  rotation  of  the      barrel<br>
wheel drum (9) causing the rail (14) material to be lifted<br>
 8.<br>
by means of the rail clamps (13) as mentioned above. By such self-propelled mechanised system of loading/unloading the involvement of labour, power and man hour is reduced to a considerable extend. A single operator by means of a handle lever unit would be able to control the operation of the system as per the capacity so as to unwind and rewind the wire ropes (18) for lifting and loading unloading the rail (14) material. In addition, the system of loading/unloading as per the present invention also avoids the disadvantages faced in the art due to the dragging caused by the weight of the rails (14) during lifting as the boom (4) allows free access to the rails (14) thereby providing for a safe, clear and stable lifting during loading. Moreover once the rails (14) is lifted clear from the height of the flat wagon (P) it is carried over on top of the wagon by horiontal mechanical movement of the trolley (5) carrying the load guided by the boom (4)-to any desired location of the flat wagon (1) and then unloaded mechanically. For unloading the same from the flat wagon (1) to the ground the same above said procedure are followed.<br>
 9.<br>
However, as per safety standards laid by the Railways that a 13 metre single rail has to be lifted at two points as a consequence of this standard a second apparatus (10) is provided which is also attached to the same wagon in the above said manner and operated simultaneously .Likewise 3/5 10/20 welded rail panels a considerable length of rails (14) are loaded at the same ~ time on a plurality of wagons [BHR/BRH] able to handle such loads it is seen that a length of one wagon is 13.5 metre hence 3 rail welded panel is accommodated on three endless wagons and rail 5 welded panel is accommodated on five endless wagons and so on. Likewise two identical apparatuses (10) are attached to each of the said wagons and the entire operation can be cotrolled remotely by a single operator when the power unit is an electric motor.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to the non-limiting embodiments and as described by the accompanying claims.<br>
