The disclosures of each of the patents and patent applications mentioned above are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fusion proteins comprising whole biologically active peptides and antibodies, or fragments thereof. Specifically, the fusion proteins of the present invention combine the molecular recognition of antibodies with a biological activity such as immuno-stimulatory activity, membrane transport activity, and homophilic activity. The present invention further relates to fusion proteins having the binding properties of an antibody and including a biologically active peptide sequence flanked by loop forming or other conformation-conferring sequences so as to constrain the conformational flexibility of the biologically active peptide and to increase its affinity for its biological target. The present invention also relates to the use of antibodies and conjugates thereof in the inhibition of programmed cell death, i.e., apoptosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antibodies have been praised as "magic bullets" to combat disease; however, the promises made for antibodies have never been fully realized. This is due in part to the fact that antibodies represent only one arm of the immune defense, where T-cells provide the other strategy in immune defense. However, antibodies are ideal targeting and delivery devices. They are adapted for long survival in blood, have sites that help vascular and tissue penetration, and are functionally linked with a number of the defense mechanisms of innate immunity. One such mechanism is the complement system, which helps to destroy pathogens and is involved in the regulation of immune responses. For example, the complement<br><br>
fragment C3d binds to the CR2 receptor on B-cells, which is also the binding site for Epstein-Barr virus. Binding of Epstein-Barr virus to CR2 activates B-cells. Accumulated evidence has shown that the CR2 receptor (CD19/Cd20/CD81 complex) has an immuno-stimulatory role and is activated by C3d.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies have been developed for many therapeutic uses. For example, diseases currently targeted by monoclonal antibodies include heart conditions, cancers, neurological defects and autoimmune diseases. Virtually all of these current therapeutic uses rely on the inherent therapeutic efficacy of the particular monoclonal antibodies, such as with the drugs HERCEPTIN and RITUXAN. Since most monoclonal antibodies do not express such inherent therapeutic activity, development has focused on the addition of therapeutic properties by conjugation of a variety of different toxic agents, such as protein toxins or their subunits, drugs currently used in the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer, drugs which failed to progress in clinical development due to unacceptable toxicity, or radioisotopes.<br>
To make such conjugates effective, a monoclonal antibody delivering such toxic agents must be able to bind to its target antigen and internalize into cells to carry the toxic agent inside where it can be effective at damaging DNA or inhibiting protein synthesis or other metabolic functions of the targeted cell. Few antibodies inherently express such a property - the ones that do produce very potent immunoconjugates. As such, screening assays have been developed to test for such antibodies but few antibodies have been identified that combine this quality with an appropriate targeting specificity.<br>
There have been other approaches to instill internalizing ability into an antibody. Whole protein toxins which combine an active subunit with a cell binding subunit are effective in enhancing internalization when conjugated to an antibody but oftentimes reduce the selectivity of the antibody thereby leading to potential toxicity. Lipophilic drugs have also been used to enhance internalization and intracellular delivery in conjugated form but as with toxins will also reduce the selectivity of a conjugate. Other methods have been used to permeabilize or by microinjection allow better entry into cells. Both of these methods have serious drawbacks. Permeabilization of cells, e.g., by saponin, bacterial toxins, calcium phosphate, electroporation, etc., can only be practically used for ex vivo methods, and these methods cause damage to the cells. Microinjection requires highly skilled technicians (thus<br><br>
limiting its use to a laboratory setting), it physically damages the cells, and it has only limited applications as it cannot be used to treat, for example, a mass of cells or an entire tissue, because one cannot feasibly inject large numbers of cells.<br>
Another example of how antibodies can be used to enhance the immune response has been demonstrated by the work of Zanetti and Bona (Zanetti, M., Nature, 355: 466-477,1992; Zaghouani H.; Anderson S. A., Sperbeer K. E., Daian C. Kennedy R. C, Mayer L. and Bona C. A., Proc. Nat Acad. Science USA, 92: 631-635,1995). These authors have replaced the CDR3 sequence of the Ig heavy chain with a sequence resembling T-cell and B-cell antigens (epitopes) using molecular biology methods and have shown that these modified antibodies induce potent immune response specific for the inserted groups.<br>
The biological properties of the antibodies can be enhanced with respect to overall avidity for antigen and the ability to penetrate cellular and nuclear membranes. Antigen binding is enhanced by increasing the valency of antibodies such as in pentameric IgM antibodies. Valency and avidity are also increased in certain antibodies that are self-binding or homophilic (Kang, C. Y., Cheng, H. L., Rudikoff, S. and Kohler, H., J. Exp. Med. 165:1332, 1987; Xiyun, A. N., Evans, S. V., Kaminki, M. J., Fillies, S. F. D., Resifeld, R. A., Noughton, A. N. and Chapman, P. B., J. Immunol 157: 1582-1588,1996). A peptide in the heavy chain variable region was identified which inhibited self-binding (Kang, C. Y. Brunck, T. K., Kieber-Emmons, T., Blalock, J. E. and Kohler, H., Science, 240: 1034-1036, 1988). The insertion of a self-binding peptide sequence into an antibody endows the property of self-binding and increases the valency and overall avidity for the antigen.<br>
Similarly, the addition of a signal peptide to antibodies facilitates transmembrane transport as demonstrated by Rojas et al, Nature Biotechnology*, 16: 370-375 (1998). Rojas et al. have generated a fusion protein containing a 12-mer peptide and have shown that this protein has cell membrane permeability.<br>
Signal peptide sequences that express the common motif of hydrophobicity mediate translocation of most intracellular secretory proteins across mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prokaryotic plasma membranes through the putative protein-conducting channels. The major model implies that the proteins are transported across membranes<br><br>
through a hydrophilic protein-conducting channel formed by a number of membrane proteins. In eukaryotes, newly synthesized proteins in the cytoplasm are targeted to the ER membrane by signal sequences that are recognized generally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its ER membrane receptors. This targeting step is followed by the actual transfer of protein across the ER membrane and out of the cell through the putative protein-conducting channel. Signal peptides can also interact strongly with lipids, supporting the proposal that the transport of some secretory proteins across cellular membranes may occur directly through the lipid bilayer in the absence of any proteinaceous channels. Such signal peptides can be used to enhance internalization of antibodies or other biologically active molecules into cells and are the subject of several patents (U.S. Patents # 5,807,746, #6,043,339 and #6,238,667),<br>
Antibodies have been used as delivery devices for several biologically active molecules, such as toxins, drugs and cytokines. Often fragments of antibodies, Fab or scFv, are preferred because of better tissue penetration and reduced "stickiness".<br>
There are two practical methods for attaching molecules, such as peptides, to antibody molecules. One method is to use chemical crosslinking, such as the affinity-crosslinking method described in U,S. Ser. No. 09/070,907. Another method is to design a fusion gene containing DNA encoding the antibody and the peptide and to express the fusion gene, which method is the subject of the present application.<br>
Antibody fusion proteins are typically engineered with entire genes of large proteins or domains of such proteins that afford a biological function. Previous small peptide-antibody fusion proteins have typically been made mainly for the purpose of facilitating purification or characterization of the antibody.<br>

Fusion proteins including those with immunoglobulins primarily incorporating active domains of proteins such as cytokines, toxins, enzymes, etc. with targeting domains of immunoglobulins including the CDR's (complementarity-determining regions) and other variable regions and domains not directly involved in antigen binding but through secondary interactions able to confer increased affinity of binding are described, for example, in the following publications incorporated herein by reference:<br>

Fusion proteins designed to have biological activity may be constructed using linear peptide sequences derived from a whole biologically active protein. However, such peptides have typically lower affinity than the entire protein. Since the incorporation of a peptide into a fusion protein is less cumbersome than the incorporation of an entire functional protein, there is a need for fusion proteins containing peptides having a binding affinity as good as a full-length protein.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of antibodies and fragments thereof in the inhibition of apoptosis. Cell suicide (apoptosis) is a mechanism used beneficially by living organisms in cell differentiation in organ development and elimination of damaged cells. However, apoptosis can also be associated with forms of pathogenesis. For example, it is the major cause for the loss of neurons in Alzheimer's disease and tissue loss during myocardial infarction. Also, T lymphocytes from HIV-1 infected individuals undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of a stimulus compared to uninfected T cells cultured under the same conditions. The "spontaneous apoptosis" of CD4+ and CD84- cells has been shown to be accelerated by the in-vitro addition of an HIV-1 related, anti-idiotypic antibody.<br>
Caspase enzymes, e.g., caspase-3, are critically involved in the pathway of apoptosis. A number of materials and methods have been proposed for inhibiting caspase action in an effort to inhibit apoptosis. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,566,338 (Weber et al.) proposes the use of caspase inhibitors generally for treating, ameliorating, and preventing non-cancer cell death during chemotherapy and radiation therapy and for treating and ameliorating the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy of cancer. U.S. Patent No, 6,596,693 (Keana et al.) reports that certain dipeptides can be potent inhibitors of apoptosis. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,689,784 (Bebbington, et al.) and 6,620,782 (Cai et al.) propose a class of carbamates and substituted 2-aminobenzamides, respectively, as inhibitors of apoptosis. Also, U.S. Patent No. 6,426,413 (Wannamaker et al) is a representative proposal for a class of caspase inhibitors called interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitors. Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 6,228,603 (Reed et al.) proposes a screening assay for identifying agents that alter the specific association of an inhibitor of apoptosis with a caspase, such as caspase-3 or caspase-7.<br><br>
Yet another novel approach for inhibiting caspase enzymes involves the use of so-called "Superantibody Technology (SAT)". See, e.g., WO 02/097041, entitled "Fusion Proteins of Biologically Active Peptides and Antibodies" (co-assigned to Immpheron, Inc. and Innexus Corporation). One proposed application of SAT is the use of antibodies against caspase enzymes in order to inhibit apoptosis in living cells. For example, one aspect of the present invention contemplates intracellular delivery of an antibody or antibody fragment immunospecific for an enzyme involved in apoptosis. Some expected advantages of transmembrane antibodies as apoptosis inhibitors are their specific target recognition in the cell and their lower toxicity compared to conventional apoptosis inhibitors. It is an object of the present invention to provide such membrane-penetrating antibodies for therapeutic benefit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a fusion protein comprising an antibody domain and a peptide domain, wherein the biological activity of the peptide domain is selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities. The peptide is covalently linked to a site on the antibody so that the incorporated peptide does not compromise the antigen recognition of the antibody. In the present invention, this is accomplished by a method comprising the steps of creating a fusion gene comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody and a nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide, wherein the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide is located inside the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody at a site wherein, when the fusion is expressed, the fusion protein that is created thereby includes the antibody plus the peptide, and the peptide is connected to the antibody at a site that does not interfere with antigen binding of the antibody, and expressing the fusion gene to create the fusion protein. In particular, the fusion protein may be created by providing a gene encoding an antibody, wherein the gene is mutated to contain a restriction site, wherein the restriction site is located away from any section of the gene that encodes an antigen-binding site of the antibody, inserting a DNA sequence encoding a peptide having a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities into restriction site of the gene encoding the antibody to create a fusion gene, and wherein the DNA sequence encoding the peptide is inserted so that it is in-frame with the gene encoding the antibody, and expressing the fusion gene to create a fusion protein.<br><br>
In order to enhance the biological activity of the peptide, the peptide may be flanked by loop-forming or conformation-conferring sequences.<br>
The invention also provides a composition and a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein of a peptide having a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities and an antibody.<br>
The invention of creating fusion proteins of biologically active peptides and antibodies includes peptides which comprise self-binding, stimulate lymphocytes and allow transport across biological membranes.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is for novel compounds and methods for regulating cell function, either in normal or infected cells. In particular, such compounds and methods entail the use of an antibody, or antibody fragment thereof, conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide. The antibody, or fragment thereof, is preferably immmunospecific, i.e., it recognizes and binds specifically with high affinity to, for such protein targets as: (a) signaling proteins internal the cell, such as caspases, kinases, and phosphatases, (b) immature virion proteins prior to intracellular assembly, (c) cell-surface or intracellular tumor antigens, (d) nuclear or nucleolar proteins that are involved in regulation of DNA synthesis and gene expression, or (e) cytoskeletal proteins that participate in cell proliferation or cytostasis, Either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be used.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, an aforementioned compound is effective in inhibiting apoptosis and comprises an anti-caspase antibody, or fragment thereof, conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide. A particularly preferred antibody is an anti-caspase-3 antibody.<br>

A particularly preferred MTS peptide comprises the amino acid residue sequence AAVLLPVLLAAP (SEQ ID NO: 9), such as the peptide sequence KGEGAAVLLPVLLAAPG (SEQ ID NO: 8).<br><br>
Also contemplated is a pharmaceutical composition effective in inhibiting apoptosis in human cells, and which therefore is implicated as being effective in the treatment of human diseases, that comprises an anti-caspase antibody, or fragment thereof, conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide, e.g., an MTS peptide. The antibody-peptide conjugates of the present invention are capable of causing internalization of the antibody or antibody fragment into cells.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a method of treating or preventing a disease comprises administering to a patient in need thereof a pharmacologically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-caspase antibody, or fragment thereof, conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide or fragment thereof. Specifically demonstrated are modified anti-caspase antibodies conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide that reduce chemically induced apoptosis. These results suggest such antibodies have therapeutic potential to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's or Parkinson's.<br>
The above and other objects of the invention will become readily apparent to those of skill in the relevant art from the following detailed description and figures, wherein only preferred embodiments of the invention are shown and described. As is readily recognized, the invention is capable of modifications within the skill of the relevant art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a method for creating fusion proteins of an antibody and a peptide having a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a peptide having a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities, wherein the peptide is located at a site in the antibody so that the incorporated peptide does not compromise the antigen recognition of the antibody. In the present invention, this is accomplished by a method comprising the steps of creating a fusion gene comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody and a nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide, wherein the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide is located inside the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody at a site wherein, when the fusion is expressed, the fusion protein that is created thereby includes the antibody plus the peptide, and the peptide is connected to the antibody at a site that does not interfere with antigen binding of the antibody, and expressing the fusion<br><br>
gene to create the fusion protein. In particular, the fusion protein may be created by providing a gene encoding an antibody, wherein the gene is mutated to contain a restriction site, wherein the restriction site is located away from any section of the gene that encodes an antigen-binding site of the antibody, inserting a DNA sequence encoding a peptide having a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities into restriction site of the gene encoding the antibody to create a fusion gene, and wherein the DNA sequence encoding the peptide is inserted so that it is in-frame with the gene encoding the antibody, and expressing the fusion gene to create a fusion protein.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the peptide having biological activity may be attached to the C-terminus of the antibody. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the peptide may be flanked by loop-forming or conformation-conferring sequences to enhance the biological activity of the peptide.<br>
As used herein, the term "targeting moiety" refers to any natural or synthesized protein molecule containing an antigen- binding site. The term includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or any functional fragment, such as a variable domain fragment of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, CDR regions, ScFv, Fab, F(ab)'2, or engineered antibody mimics or single domain binding moieties. A particular targeting moiety is selected in accordance with the desired target, such as a cellular receptor on a membrane structure, e.g., a protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide or carbohydrate. The targeting moiety can be selected to bind a cellular receptor on a normal cell or on a tumor cell.<br>
Likewise, the peptide having biological activity is selected according to the desired function of the fusion protein, or, in other words, according to the desired result after the targeting moiety binds to a target such as a normal cell or a tumor cell. Possible biological activities that may be desired include immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities.<br><br>
The loop-forming or conformation-constraining sequences may be any amino acid sequences that, when placed on either side of the peptide having biological activity, restrain the conformational flexibility of the peptide. Examples include sequences containing amino acid residues such as cysteine pairs that can cross-link to form loops. A specific example of a conformation-constraining protein is thioredoxin. Examples of conformation-constraining or loop-forming moieties may be found, for example, in the following U.S. Patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,242,163 and 6,004,746 to Brent, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,258,550; 6,147,189; 6,111,069; 6,100,044; 6,084,066; 5,952,465; 5,948,887; and 5,928,896 to Brent et al, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,200,759 and 5,925,523 to Dove et al., and in the following publications:<br>

The Expression of Ig-fusion Proteins. Ig fusion proteins have the advantage of joining the antibody combining specificity and/or antibody effector junctions with molecules contributing unique properties. The ability to produce this family of proteins was first demonstrated when c-myc was substituted for the Fc of the antibody molecule,(Neuberger M S, Williams G T and Fox R O., Nature, 125:604,1984) but many examples now exist. Ab fusion proteins can be achieved in several different ways. In one approach non-Ig sequences are substituted for the variable region; the molecule replacing the V region provides specificity of targeting with the antibody contributing properties such as effector functions and improved pharmacokinetics. Examples include IL-2 and CD4. Alternatively, non-Ig sequences can be substituted for or attached to the constant region. The resulting molecules retain the binding specificity of the original antibody but gain characteristics from the attached protein. Depending on the position of the substitution, different antibody-related effector functions and biologic properties will be retained. See, for example, Antibody Engineering, 2nd Edition, ed.: Carl A. K. Borrebaeck, Oxford University Press, 1995)<br>
Vectors for the Construction of IgG Fusion Proteins. A series of vectors has now been produced that permits the fusion of proteins at different positions within an antibody molecule, thereby facilitating the construction of fusion proteins with different properties. Using these vectors it is possible to produce a family of fusion proteins with molecules of differing molecular weight, valence, and having different subsets of the functional properties of the antibody molecule.<br>
As a specific example of how to facilitate the construction of fused genes, site-directed<br><br>
mutagenesis was used to generate unique restriction enzyme sites in the human IgG3 heavy chain gene. In this particular example, restriction sites were generated at the 3? end of the CHI exon, immediately after the hinge at the 5! end of the CH2 exon, and at the 3' end of the CH3 exon. The restriction sites thus produced were SnaB I at the end of CHI by replacing TtgGTg with TacGTa, Pvu II at the beginning of CH2 by replacing CAcCTG with CAgCTG, and Ssp I at the end of CH3 replacing AATgag with AATatt. These manipulations provided a unique blunt-end cloning site at these positions. In all cases the restriction site was positioned so that after cleavage the Ig would contribute the first base of the codon. Human IgG3 with an extended hinge region of 62 amino acids was chosen for use as the immunoglobulin; when present this hinge should provide spacing and flexibility, thereby facilitating simultaneous antigen and receptor binding. An EcoR I site was also introduced at 3' of the IgG3 gene to provide a 3' cloning site and polyA addition signal. Although initially designed for use with growth factors, these restrictions sites can be used to position any novel sequence at defined positions in the antibody. Also, using these cloning cassettes the variable region can easily be changed. Similar techniques may be used to generate suitable restriction sites in other antibody genes.<br>
Production of A Fusion Gene. As a first step in the production of a fusion protein, a blunt-end restriction site must be introduced at the desired position into the 5' end of the gene to be fused. In order to maintain the correct reading frame, the site must be positioned so that after cleavage it will contribute two bases to the codon. If the objective is to make a fusion protein with the complete molecule, the restriction site is usually introduced at the position of any post-translational processing, such as after the leader sequence. Alternatively, if the objective is to use only a portion of the protein, the blunt-end site can be introduced at any position within the gene, but attention must always be paid to maintaining the correct reading frame. Additionally, if there is carboxyl-terminal post-translational processing of the fused protein, it is frequently desirable to introduce a stop-codon at this processing site.<br>
A major concern when producing fusion proteins is maintaining the biologic activities of all of the components. The production of fusion proteins with antibodies is facilitated by the domain structure of the antibody, and all of the cloning sites have been positioned immediately following an intact domain. In this configuration the correct folding of the immunoglobulin should be assured. The folding of the attached protein depends on its<br><br>
structure and where it is fused. Whenever structural information is available, it is desirable to produce the fusion at a position that will maintain the structural integrity of the attached protein.<br>
To produce quantities of protein sufficient for functional analysis, it is desirable to have the protein secreted into the medium. While in the examples reported to date, assembled fusion proteins have been assembled and secreted, this remains a concern when designing additional fusion proteins.<br>
The method to design a fusion gene that contains a biologically activity peptide as part of the heavy or light chain gene can use established antibody engineering protocols (Antibody Engineering. 2nd Edition, ed.: Carl A. K. Borrebaeck, Oxford University Press 1995. Chapter 9, pages 267-293). The peptide can fused either to N-terminal residues or the C-terminal residues of H or L chains. The expression of such fused genes is typically done in mammalian cell lines, although other expression systems, such as, for example, bacteria or yeast expression systems, may be used.<br>
The peptide of the invention has a biological activity selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities. Examples include immuno-stimulatory or immuno-regulatory activity. The peptide may, for example, be a hormone, ligand for cytokines or a binding site derived from natural ligands for cellular receptors. In a preferred embodiment, the peptide is derived from C3d region 1217-1232 and ranges from about 10 to about 16 men In an alternative embodiment, the peptide is a 16 mer peptide derived from the C3d region 1217-1232.<br>
The peptide may be bound to an antibody that is a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or a variable domain fragment of an antibody. As used herein, the term "antibody" refers generally to a heavy or light chain immunoglobulin molecule or any function combination or fragment thereof containing an antigen-binding site. The antibody is preferably specific for a cellular receptor, on a membrane structure such as a protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide or carbohydrate, and on a normal cell or on tumor cells.<br>
The use of peptides derived from the ligand site of C3d as an immunostimulatory component<br><br>
incorporated into antibodies has an unexpected utility as a molecular adjuvant. C3d has been used as molecular adjuvant as part of a complete fusion protein with hen egg lysozyme (HEL) by D. Fearon, et al, (Dempsey, P. W.s Allison, M. E. D., Akkaraju, S.s Goodnow, C. C. and Fearon, D. T., Science, 271:348, 1996). These authors have shown that a HEL- C3d fusion protein is up to 10,000 fold more immunogenic than free HEL (see International Patent Publication, W096/17625).<br>
Similar increases in immunogenicity have been observed with chemical cross-linked idiotype vaccines using a peptide derived from the C3d fragment in our recent animal studies (see examples below). It is believed that attaching C3d peptides to idiotype and anti-idiotype vaccines enhances the immunogenicity of these vaccines and substitutes for the need of attaching carrier molecules such as KLH in combination with strong adjuvants, such as Freund's adjuvant, which is not permitted by the FDA for use with humans.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the peptide may be derived from a human or non-human C3d region homologous to the human C3d residues at position 1217-1232 and ranges from about 10 to about 16 mer. Other applications of affinity cross-linking biologically active peptides to antibody vaccines include active peptides derived from cytokines. For example, a nonapeptide from the ILl-beta cytokine has been described (Antoni, et al., J. Immunol, 137:3201-04,1986) which has immunostimulatory properties without inducing undesired side effects. Other examples of active peptides which can be inserted into antibodies in accordance with the invention include signal peptides, and peptides from the self-binding locus of antibodies.<br>
A variety of peptides are known having biological activities as hormones, ligands for cytokines or binding sites derived from natural ligands for cellular receptors.<br>
The following Examples 1-3, while relating to C3d/antibody complexes that are created by affinity cross-linking, are provided to show the effects on the immune response provided by C3d peptides linked to antibodies.<br>
Example 1. Enhancement of an Anti-idiotype Vaccine. 3H1 is a murine anti-idiotype antibody (Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, et al., J. Immunol, 145:2758-65,1990) which mimics the<br><br>
carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA). 3H1 induces in animals anti-CEA antibodies when used as KLH-conjugated vaccine in complete Freund's adjuvant. 3H1 has also been tested in a clinical phase I study where it induces antibodies which bind to CEA in approximately half of treated cancer patients. However no clinical response was observed in this study (Foon, et al., J. Clin. Invst., 96:334-342,1995) due, in part, to low immunogenicity.<br>
3H1 mAb was affinity cross-linked with a 13-mer peptide (SEQ ID NO.: 1) derived from the C3d region 1217-1232. The amino acid sequence was derived from of the Cd3 peptide and has the following sequence: KNRWEDPGKQLYNVEA (SEQ ID NO. 1)<br>
BALB/c mice were immunized twice with 25µg of C3d-3H1 in phosphate-saline solution intramuscular. 7 days after the last immunization mice were bled and sera were tested for binding to 8019 (Abl idiotype) and to the CEA expressing tumor line LS174T. As determined by FACS, sera from C3d-3H1 immune mice bind to LS174T tumor cells, while a control serum (normal mouse serum) showed only background fluorescence. Sera from mice immunized with C3d-3H1 were used in FACS of LS174T cells in a sandwich assay developed with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Control was a normal mouse serum. Cell numbers analyzed were plotted against relative fluorescence intensity on log 10 scale.<br>
Example 2. Furthermore, sera from mice immunized three times with either 3H1 (25 microgram in saline) or 3Hl-C3d-peptide (affinity cross-linked, 25 microgram in saline) were also tested for Ab3 response. Mice were bled and sera were tested for binding to F(ab) of 3H1 in ELISA. Upon determining the binding of dilutions of mouse sera to 3H1 F(ab), it was found that while naked 3H1 does not induce Ab3 antibodies, 3Hl-peptide does showing that the affinity-cross-linked 3H1 enhanced immunogenicity.<br>
Other C3d peptides which may be used in the practice of the present invention include those reviewed in Lambris et al, "Phylogeny of the third component of complement, C3" in Erfi, A ed. New Aspects of Complement structure and function, Austin, R. D. Landes Co., 1994 p. 15-34, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Example 3. Enhancement of an Mouse Tumor Idiotype Vaccine (38C13). 38C13 is the idiotype expressed by the 38C13 B-lymphoma tumor cell line. The Levy group has developed<br><br>
this idiotype tumor vaccine model and has shown that pre-immunization with KLH-conjugated 38C13 Id can protect against challenge with 38C13 tumor cells in mice (Kaminski, M. S., Kitamura, K., Maloney, D. G. and Levy, R., 1 Immunol, 138:1289, 1987). Levy and colleagues (Tao, M-H. and Levy, R., Nature, 362:755-758, 1993) have also reported on the induction of tumor protection using a fusion protein (CSF-38C13), generated from a chimeric gene and expressed in mammalian cell culture fermentation. 38C13 Id proteins were affinity cross-linked with a 16-mer azido-peptide derived from the C3D region 1217-1232.<br>
Ten mice were immunized with 50 ug of C3d-38C13 conjugate in phosphate-saline solution intra-peritoneally three times. After the third vaccination mice were challenge with 38C13 tumor cells. Control groups included mice vaccinated with 38C13-KLH in QS-21 (adjuvant), considered the "gold standard" in this tumor model, and mice injected with QS-21 alone. Seven out often mice vaccinated with the C3d-38C13 conjugate survived by day 35 after tumor challenge, as did mice vaccinated with the KLH-38C13 in QS-21. All control mice injected only with QS-21 died by day 22.<br>
C3H mice were immunized three times with either 38C13-KLH in QS-21 or with 38C13-C3d peptide without QS-21 (50 µg i.p.) Control mice were only injected with QS-21. Immunized and control mice were than challenged with 38C13 tumor cells and survival was monitored.<br>
Results described in Examples 1-3 show that affinity-cross-linking of an immuno-stimulatory peptide to tumor anti-idiotype and idiotype vaccine antibodies can significantly enhance the immune response to the tumor and protect against tumor challenge. The vaccination protocol with the C3d-cross-linked vaccine did not include any adjuvant, such as Freund's adjuvant, or KLH conjugation, both of which are not permissible by the FDA for human use.<br>
Some of the procedures used in the above examples are known; the active binding peptide of C3d (complement fragment) has been described by Lambris, et ah, (PNAS, 82:4235-39, 1985) and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The following additional examples are provided to demonstrate the general technique of creating fusion proteins and to illustrate particular peptide having a biological activity<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of immuno-stimulatory, membrane transport and homophilic activities.<br>
Example 4. Fusion non-Ig Protein containing a Membrane Transferring Peptide (MTS-peptide) See, e.g., Rojas, M, Donahue, J P, Tan, T. and Lin, Y-Z. Nature Biotech, 16: 370, "Construction of the glutathion S-transferase-MTS peptide (GST-MTS) expression plasmids," 1998.<br>
Two different GST-MTS expression plasmids were constructed so that, depending on the biological application, a target protein or protein domain could be produced with the hydrophobic MTS as either an amino-terminal or a carboxyl-terminal extension. For the construction of plasmids pGEX-3X~MTS I and pGEX3X-MTS2, the following complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized:<br>
MTSI:GATCGCAGCCGTTCTTCTCCCTGTTCTTCTTGCCGCACCCGG-CGTCGGCAAGAAGAGGGACAAGAAGAACGGCGTGGGCCCTAG (SEQ ID NO, 2) MTS2:GATCCCCGCAGCCGTTCTTCTCCCTGTTCTTCTTGCCGCACCCTAGC-GGGCGTCGGCAAGAAGAGGGACAAGAAGAACGGCGTGGGATTCGCTAG (SEQ ID NO. 3)<br>
After annealing, the double-stranded MTS I and MTS2 oligonucleotides were ligated in BamHI digested pGEX-3X (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., "Single-step purification of polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions with glutathione S-transferase," Gene, 67:31,1988.). DNA sequence analysis confirmed that in each plasmid the MTS coding sequence was correct and in-frame with the GST coding sequence.<br>
Construction of GST-Grb2SH2. GST-Grb2SH2-MTS. and GST-StatlSH2-MTS Expression Plasmids. A DNA fragment encoding the human Grb2 SH2 domain (amino acid residues 54-164) (Lowenstein, E. J., Daly, R. J., Batzer, A. G., U, W., Margolis, B., Lammers, R et al., "The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein Grb2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling," Cell, 70:431,1992) or the human Statl SH2 domain (residues 567-716) (Schindler, C, Fu, X.-Y, Impnota, T., Aebersold, R., and Darnell, J. E. Jr., Proc. Natl Acad, Sci USA 89:7836,1992) was synthesized from a Grb2 cDNA clone or a Statl cDNA clone by PCR. The primers used for PCR, each containing BamHI sites at their 5'ends, were as<br><br>
follows:<br>
Grb2 SH2: 5'-CCGGATCCCCGAAATGAAACCACATCCGTGGTTTTTTGGC (SEQ ID NO. 4) and<br>
S'-CCGGATCCCGAGGGCCTGGACGTATGTCGGCTGCTGTGG (SEQ ID NO. 5). Statl SH2: 5'-CCGGATCCCCAAACACCTGCTCCCTCTCTGGAATGATGGG (SEQ ID NO. 6) and 5*-CCGGATCC-CTCTAGAGGGTGAACTTCAGACACAGAAAT (SEQ ID NO. 7).<br>
The PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated in BamHI-digested pGEX-3X or pGEX-3XMTS2. DNA sequence analysis of the vector/insert junctions confirmed that the GST-Grb2SH2, GST-Grb2SH2-MTS5 and GST-StatlSH2-MTS translational reading frames were maintained in each expression plasmid.<br>
Expression of MTS Fusion Protein<br>
Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins. E. coli strain DHSor containing the appropriate expression plasmid 74 as grown in LB broth containing 100µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C. GST fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl, B-D-thiogalactoside (0.5 mM final concentration), and incubation at 37°C was continued for 2-3 hours. GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S. Gene, 67:31, 1988) except that after sonication, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 2000.times.g for 5 minutes prior to mixing with glutathione-agarose beads. Protein preparations were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PMIO membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at 4°C for immediate use or -70°C for prolonged storage. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Immediately prior to their use in biological assays, protein concentrations were verified by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie brilliant blue staining intensity compared with wild-type GST of known concentration. To confirm the amino acid content of the MTS in GST-MTS proteins, the MTS peptide was cleaved from glutathione-agarose bound GST-MTSI with protease factor Xa essentially as described (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., Gene 67:31,1988). The released MTS-containing peptide was purified by C, reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry analysis as described (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., Gene 67:31,1988). The released MTS-containing peptide was purified by C18 reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry as described<br><br>
(Lin, Y-Z., Yao, S., Veach, R. A., Torgerson, T. R., and Hawiger, J., J Biol Chem. 270:14255,1995).<br>
Example 5, C3d -HEL fusion protein (Dempsev et aL Science. 271:348. 1996) The complimentary DNA encoding HEL, C3d (H. Domdey et al.s Pro. Natl Acad Sci USA, 79: 7619,1982) doq pre-pro-insulin signal sequence (M. E. Taylor and K. Drickamer, Biochem. J., 274, 575, 1991), and the (G4S)2 linker were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The epitope tag and stop codon were coded for by oligonucleotide linkers. Fusion protein cassetes were assembled in tandem: doq pre-pro-insulin signal sequence, HEL, and one to three copies of C3d linked by (G4S)2 in pSG5 (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). The HEL-C3d3 cassette was subcloned into the A71d vector. The plasmids pSG.HEL, pSG.HEL.C3d, and pSG.HEL.C3d2 were co-transfected with pSV2-neo into L cells and A71d. HEL.C3d3 was transiently expressed in COS cells. Recombinant proteins were punfied by affhity chromatography on YL 1/2 antibody (H. Skinner et al., J. Biol Chem.,66: 14163,1991) and fractionation on Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia).<br>
Fusion tails are useful at the lab scale and have potential for enhancing recovery using economical recovery methods that are easily scaled up for industrial downstream processing. Fusion tails can be used to promote secretion of target proteins and can also provide useful assay tags based on enzymatic activity or antibody binding. Many fusion tails do not interfere with the biological activity of the target protein and in some cases have been shown to stabilize it. Nevertheless, for the purification of authentic proteins a site for specific cleavage is often included, allowing removal of the tail after recovery.<br>
Fusion Tails for the Recovery and Purification of Recombinant Proteins. (See, e.g., Ford C, Suominen L, Glatz C, Protein Expr. Purif. 2-3:95-107,1991). The fusion protein of the present invention may also include a fusion tail such as has been developed to promote efficient recovery and purification of recombinant proteins from crude cell extracts or culture media. In these systems, a target protein is genetically engineered to contain a C- or N-terminal polypeptide tail, which provides the biochemical basis for specificity in recovery and purification. Tails with a variety of characteristics have been used:<br>
(1)	entire enzymes with affinity for immobilized substrates or inhibitors;<br>
(2)	peptide-binding proteins with affinity to immunoglobulin G or albumin;<br><br>
(3)	carbohydrate-binding proteins or domains;<br>
(4)	a biotin-binding domain for in vivo biotinylation promoting affinity of the fusion protein to avidin or streptavidin;<br>
(5)	antigenic epitopes with affinity to immobilized monoclonal antibodies;<br>
(6)	poly(His) residues for recovery by immobilized metal affinity chromatography; and<br>
(7)	other poly(amino acid)s, with binding specificity based on properties of the amino acid side chain.<br>

The present invention describes the generation of an antibody-peptide fusion protein that enhances the biological and immunological activity of the antibody without changing the antibody specificity for the corresponding antigen. The genetically engineered fusion protein mimics the chemically engineered chimeric antibodies described in patent application Ser. No. 09/070,907.

Also contemplated is a pharmaceutical composition effective in inhibiting apoptosis that comprises an anti-caspase antibody conjugated to a membrane transporter protein or fragment<br><br>
thereof, as discussed herein. Such fusion proteins and methods of generating them are disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 09/865,281 (Kohler et al.), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A preferred immunoconjugate of the present invention comprises a secondary antibody conjugated to an MTS sequence through one of several types of linkages including through the nucleotide or tryptophan sites of the antibody or through the N-linked carbohydrate of the antibody. A "secondary antibody," as used herein, refers to an antibody, or fragment thereof, that binds specifically and with high affinity to a primary antibody. The secondary antibodies useful for the present invention include polyclonal or monoclonal antiglobulins to murine or human IgG or secondary antibodies targeted to novel and/or installed sequences such as the T15 sequence (Kang, CY, Brunck, TK, Kieber-Emmons, T, et. ah "Inhibition of self-binding antibodies (autobodies) by a VH-derived peptide," Science, 240:1034-6, 1988), which imparts autophilicity to an antibody.<br>
Delivery is accomplished by pre-administering or pre-injecting a monoclonal antibody or immunoconjugate, targeted to a cell-surface antigen, allowing sufficient time for binding to the target and clearance from the tissues, and following with administration of a secondary antibody covalently linked to a MTS peptide. The primary antibody can be conjugated to an inhibitor, such as a toxin, drug, enzyme or isotope, thereby enhancing delivery of an inhibitory molecule into the cell. The secondary antibody conjugated to MTS peptide recognizes and binds to the primary antibody, and is internalized into the cell through the MTS peptide activity. In this way, the primary immunoconjugate is brought into the cell where its inhibitory action is enhanced.<br>
Such secondary conjugates can also be used to assess the utility of monoclonal antibodies to intracellular targets by admixing primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to MTS, then exposing cells and testing for inhibition of cellular activities targeted with the primary antibody. In this rapid screen, many antibodies to intracellular targets can be screened for utility as antagonists or agonists. Those with activity can then be directly conjugated to a membrane transporter peptide, such as MTS, for in vivo use.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the current invention utilizes MTS peptides conjugated to a tryptophan or nucleotide binding site of a secondary antibody and a primary antibody,<br><br>
conjugated to a toxin, drug or isotope attached through a sulfhydryl, epsilon amino acid or carbohydrate residues via chemical or peptide linkers or chelates.<br>
The present invention relates generally to the in vivo delivery of antibody conjugates into the interior of cells, Such antibodies can be potentially neutralizing, anti-viral antibodies, anti-regulatory protein antibodies, or anti-tumor antibodies. For example, delivery can be accomplished by administering to a living organism an antibody conjugate comprising a MTS peptide, and an antibody directed at determinants on a virus or other intracellular pathogen that are best expressed on immature virus or pathogen. Such conjugates have an increased opportunity for binding with high affinity, disrupting virus assembly and neutralizing virus before it has a chance to mature and infect other cells.<br>
Thus, the current invention provides antiviral (anti-HIV) therapeutics as an example of a broader class of antibody therapeutics. The antibodies preferred in the current invention have the following preferred properties:<br>
(1)	They bind to antigens primarily expressed intracellularly. This includes tumor associated antigens (TAA) and viral glycoproteins. The former, includes TAA such as CEA. A particular determinant may be primarily associated with intracellular forms of the protein whereas others may be primarily expressed on the surface. Prior to this invention, most useful therapeutic antibodies have been selected for reactivity to cell surface molecules; with the ability to target intracellular antigens, selection criteria would include primary reactivity with intracellular antigen.<br>
(2)	Intracellular targets include viral glycoproteins. For instance, most monoclonal antibodies have been raised to virus propagated in cells for many passages rather than virus propagated in cells for only a few passages; as a result most monoclonals to viruses react better to laboratory strains of virus rather than fresh isolates. The proposed explanation for this difference in binding is that most antibodies, as with those to HIV, react to determinants that are cryptic and partially occluded on viral glycoproteins from low passaged virus (and presumably newly synthesized virus) because of higher glycosylation and folding of viral glycoproteins. This would mean that most antibodies should bind better to immature virions or incomplete virions that have under-glycosylated or incompletely glycosylated glycoproteins and/or ones that are not fully assembled. Thus, antibodies not considered useful for therapy because of<br><br>
limited reactivity with native virus, would, with access to intracellular, immature forms, be useful for targeting.<br>
(3)	They bind to a linear sequence of amino acids on TAA or viral glycoproteins rather than a conformation-dependent sequence. Such an antibody is more likely to bind to intracellular antigens, early in synthesis and maturation; this would include immature virions or non-assembled, glycoprotein precursors, present within cells.<br>
(4)	The antibodies should bind with an affinity of 10'9M or greater to their determinants.<br>
It is now shown herein, by way of specific Examples, that a MTS-transport-peptide modified monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody reduces actinomycin D-induced apoptosis and cleavage of spectrin in living cells. These results suggest that such antibodies have a therapeutic potential to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of diseases.<br>
Example 6. Cell line and antibodies. Human Jurkat T cell lymphomas were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic (penicillin, streptomycin and amphetericin). Rabbit polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody and anti-cleaved fodrin, i.e., alpha II spectrin, were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Rabbit monoclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody was purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-spectrin antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody 3H1 (anti-CEA) was purified from cell-culture supernatant by protein G affinity chromatography.

ApoAlert Caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay kit was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, (Palo Alto, CA). The Cell Death Detection ELISA was purchased form Roche Applied Sicence (Indianapolis, IN). Caspace inhibitors were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA).<br>
Example 7. Synthesis of antibodv-peptide conjugate. MTS peptide<br>
(KGEGAAVLLPVLLAAPG) is a signal peptide-based membrane translocation sequence (1), and was synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA). Antibodies were dialyzed against PBS (pH6.0) buffer, oxidized by adding 1/10 volume of 200 mmol/L NalCU and incubating at 4 °C for 30min in the dark. The oxidation was stopped by adding glycerol to 30 mM and the sample was dialyzed at 4°C for 30min against PBS (pH6.0) buffer. 50 times<br><br>
more in molecules of MTS peptide was used to couple the antibodies by incubation at 37°C for lh, then the antibody-peptide was dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4).<br>
Example 8. Effect of MTS-coniugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody on cell growth. 2.5 x 105 Jurkat cells were seeded into 96-well culture plate. After incubation with 0.5 pg MTS-antibody conjugates for 6, 12, 18 and 24 hour, aliquots were removed and viable cells were counted using dye exclusion (trypan blue).<br>
Example 9. Study of antibody internalization by ELISA. Jurkat cells, grown in 1-ml medium, were incubated with 2 |ig of naked or MTS-antibody conjugates for 0,1,3, 6, 12 and 18 h in 6-weIl culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The cells were spun down, the culture supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the cell pellet was washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) before being homogenized by Pellet Pestle Motor (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) for 30 sec. All the cell homogenate and equal volume (10 \il) of the culture supernatant were added to sheep anti-rabbit IgG coated ELISA plate (Falcon, Oxnard, CA) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit light chain antibody was added, antibody was visualized using o-phenylenediamine.<br>
Example 10. DNA fragmentation. Jurkat cells were pre-treated with antibodies or caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-fmk) for 1 h, centrifiiged, and incubated with fresh medium containing actinomycin D (1 pg/ml) for 4 h. After treatment, Jurkat cells were collected and washed with PBS (pH 7.4), then suspended in 700 \x\ of HL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Crude DNA preparations were extracted with phenol:chloroform;isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) twice and precipitated for 24 h at -20°C with 0.1 volume of 5 M NaCl and 1 volume of isopropanol. The collected DNA was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with ImM EDTA). The same amount of DNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by UV fluorescence after staining with ethidium bromide. DNA fragmentation was also detected by cell death detection ELISA (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modification: JB6 cells were grown in plOO plates, after treatment, cells were collected and 25 |il of the whole cell lysate were applied to each sample well.<br><br>
Example 11. Preparation of total cell lvsate. Jurkat cells were treated the same way as in the previous section. After treatment, Jurkat cells were collected and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) twice, then were suspended in 300 \xl of CHAPS buffer (50 mM PIPES, pH 6.5,2 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS). The samples were sonicated for 10 sec and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and referred to as "total cell lysate."<br>
Example 12. Caspase-3-like cleavage activity assay. Jurkat cells were treated the same way as in the previous section. Using equal protein concentrations of the total cell lysate and ApoAlert Caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay Kit, the caspase-3 activity was analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was measured with a Spectra MAX GEMINI Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
Example 13. Western blot analysis. Jurkat cells were treated the same way as in the previous section. 10 fig of the total cell lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel to detect immunoreactive protein against cleaved spectrin (1:1000 dilution). Ponceau staining was used to monitor the uniformity of transfer of protein onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed with distilled water to remove excess stain and blocked in Blotto (5% milk, 10 mm Tris- HC1 [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. Before adding the secondary antibody, the membrane was washed twice with TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl with 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20), and then the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:4000 dilution. The final washing steps included three times (5 min each) with TBST and two times (5 min each) with TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl with 150 mM NaCl). The antibody bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
Results<br>
MTS conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody shows little cell growth inhibition. First tested was the potential toxicity of MTS-antibody conjugates to the cells. The cell viability assay showed that the MTS-antibody conjugate exerted little effect on cell growth (Fig. 1).<br><br>
MTS peptide promotes rapid penetration of anti active caspase-3 antibody into living cells. The ELISA was designed to capture rabbit Ig using a sandwich assay. As seen in Fig. 2, the MTS conjugation rapidly promoted monoclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody to internalize into the live cells. The translocation of Ig increased within 1 h and reached a plateau after 18 h. The antibody remaining in the culture decreased at 1 h and seemed to reach an equivalence at 18 h. The internalization of naked antibody was delayed (at 3 h) and remained at a lower level compared with MTS-conjugated anti-caspase-3 antibody.<br>
Polyclonal MTS-anti active caspase-3 antibody inhibits DNA fragmentation. MTS-conjugated or naked polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (1 |ag/ml final concentration - equal to 1:64 dilution) was added to 6-ml cultured Jurkat cells and pre-incubated for 1 h. The antibody was washed out by centrifugation, fresh medium containing only actinomycin D (1 jig/ml) without antibody was added, and cells were incubated for 4 h. Five ml of the culture was collected for DNA fragmentation. Naked (unconjugated) anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody did not prevent DNA laddering upon actinomycin D treatment. In contrast, MTS-conjugated anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody significantly inhibited DNA fragmentation (apoptosis) induced by actinomycin D (data not shown).<br>
Monoclonal MTS-anti active caspase-3 antibody prevents DNA fragmentation. MTS-conjugated or naked monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (1 jag/ml final concentration) was added to 6-ml cultured Jurkat cells and pre-incubated for 1 h. The antibody was washed out by centrifugation, fresh medium containing actinomycin D (1 |ag/rnl) without antibody was added, and cells were incubated for 4 h. Five ml of the culture was collected for DNA fragmentation and the rest saved for Cell Death ELISA assay. MTS-conjugated antibody was observed to suppress DNA ladder formation while naked (unconjugated) anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibody did not prevent DNA laddering upon actinomycin D treatment (data not shown). The Cell Death ELISA assay (Fig. 3) confirmed a significant decrease of cell apoptosis when cells are pre-treated with MTS-conjugated antibody. Jurkat cells incubated with caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-fink), maintained 100% viability, and vehicle (DMSO)-treated control cells maintained about 80% viability. In the naked anti-caspase-3 antibody treatment group, only -36% of cells remained viable after 4 h. However, the MTS-anti-caspase-3 conjugated antibody treatment dramatically protected against actinomycin D induced apoptosis, as 70% of the cells remained viable (see Table 1).<br><br>

* None = cell culture medium with 
control antibody; anti-caspase-3 = rabbit monoclonal anti-caspase 3 antibody. Apoptosis was<br>
detected using the cell death ELISA assay. The difference of ELISA readings between AD<br>
treatment and caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-fmk) treatment was judged as 100% viable. Exp. -<br>

MTS-conjugated anti active caspase-3 antibody suppresses caspase-3 activity. The Jurkat cells were treated similarly as in the previous section, and a murine anti-CEA antibody was modified and used as control. As shown in Fig. 4, caspase-3 like cleavage activity was increased upon actinomycin D treatment, MTS-conjugated monoclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody reduced caspase-3 like cleavage activity, while the MTS-3H1 antibody showed no effect. Cell death ELISA assay also confirmed MTS-conjugated monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody showed significantly reduced DNA fragmentation (data not shown).<br>
MTS-anti active caspase-3 antibody inhibits spectrin cleavage. As a downstream target of caspase-3, the protein levels of spectrin were examined. Two cleaved fragments of spectrin were observed in actinomycin D treated Jurkat cells (data not shown). Neither 3H1 nor MTS-3H1 protected spectrin from cleavage. Naked monoclonal anti-active caspase antibody showed little effect on protection; whereas MTS-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody completely suppressed the cleavage of lOOkDa and 75kDa alpha II spectrin fragments, as did caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk. The 150 kDa cleavage band showed no overt change in all antibody-pretreated cell samples.<br><br>
Conclusion<br>
The above results indicate that anti-caspase-3 antibodies can inhibit significantly in-vitro apoptosis related events such as caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and spectrin cleavage. Anti-caspase-3 antibodies therefore can be utilized to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of diseases. In contrast to therapeutically used antibodies, conventional peptide apoptosis inhibitors exert strong inhibition but also have negative side effects as high toxicity, as shown in rodent animal models. Therefore, transport membrane-linked antibodies have a lower toxicity compared to conventional apoptosis inhibitors. Transport-membrane (MTS)-linked antibodies, therefore, represent promising new candidates for the treatment of diseases involving apoptosis, in particular, in the central nervous system for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's.<br>
