Multi-stage high-pressure compression installation.<br>
The present invention concerns a multi-stage high-pressure<br>
compression installation formed of at least two compressors<br>
connected in series by means of at least one pipe.<br>
This type of high-pressure installation is used for example<br>
in the production of PET bottles, whereby the use of<br>
compressed gas with a pressure of more than 2000 kPa is<br>
required.<br>
It is known, in order to use gas pressures of 2000 kPa or<br>
more, to mount two volumetric compressors in series and to<br>
provide a first gas tank at the output of the first<br>
compressor, whereby the output of the tank is connected to<br>
the inlet of the second compressor which is part of what is<br>
called the excess pressure compressor.<br>
At the output of the aforesaid excess pressure compressor<br>
is in this case preferably provided a second tank which<br>
serves as a buffer for a user network.<br>
In a known multi-stage compressor of this type, the drive<br>
of the first compressor is controlled as a function of the<br>
pressure prevailing in the above-mentioned first tank,<br>
whereas the drive of the excess pressure compressor is<br>
controlled as a function of the pressure prevailing in the<br>
second tank.<br><br>
2<br>
The above-mentioned control implies that a compressor<br>
concerned runs under load and, consequently, only<br>
compresses gas when the pressure prevailing in the<br>
corresponding tank is lower than a preset pressure.<br>
A disadvantage of a high-pressure compressor installation<br>
of the known type is that this installation reacts<br>
relatively slowly to major fluctuations in the compressed<br>
gas consumption.<br>
Indeed, in case of a sudden increase in the compressed gas<br>
consumption, the pressure prevailing in the second Lank<br>
will at first drop until a value is reached which is lower<br>
than the preset level for switching the excess pressure<br>
compressor into a loaded regime.<br>
As soon as the excess pressure compressor is running under<br>
load, it will draw in compressed gases from the first tank,<br>
such that, subsequently, the gas pressure prevailing in<br>
this first tank will drop until it reaches a value below<br>
the preset level, such that the first compressor is loaded<br>
accordingly as well.<br>
Due to the drop of the pressure prevailing in the first<br>
tank before the first compressor is turned on, the gas<br>
pressure prevailing at the output of the excess pressure<br>
compressor will not be constant at first, and this will be<br>
so until the first compressor runs at full load and<br>
consequently produces a quantity of compressed qas which is<br>
equal to the quantity of gas drawn in by the excess<br>
pressure compressor for the subsequent compression of said<br><br>
gas .<br>
Another disadvantage of a known multi-stage compression<br>
installation is that the first tank between the two<br>
compressors must be relatively large in order to prevent,<br>
all the gas in the first tank from being consumed, at the<br>
time the excess pressure compressor is being loaded, before<br>
the first compressor has been loaded.<br>
It is clear that a large tank of this type, provided<br>
between the compressors, increases the space requirement of<br>
said compression installation which, as a consequence, will<br>
also be more expensive.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy one or several of the<br>
above-mentioned and other disadvantages.<br>
To this end, the present invention concerns a multi-stage<br>
high-pressure compression installation which is mainly<br>
formed of a main gas pipe which opens in a buffer and in<br>
which at least two compressors are mounted in series, each<br>
with their own drive, whereby the installation is equipped<br>
with means to determine the pressure prevailing at the<br>
output of the main pipe, whereby said installation is<br>
connected to a control panel, characterized in that this<br>
control panel is connected to at least two of the aforesaid<br>
compressor drives and in that it controls the compressors<br>
in such a way that they will either both run under load or<br>
both run idle and compress the same quantity of air per<br>
time unit.<br><br>
4<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that the different<br>
compressors are simultaneously turned on as a function of<br>
the pressure prevailing in the above-mentioned buffer tank,<br>
such that when the compressor which represents the first<br>
excess pressure stage is turned on, the compressors<br>
situated at the lower compression stages will be<br>
automatically turned on as well.<br>
As the different compressors are turned on together, it<br>
becomes possible to keep the pressure prevailing between<br>
each of the different compressors constant or practically<br>
constant, such that the fluctuations of the gas pressure at<br>
the output of a multi-stage compressor according to the<br>
invention are more or less minimal.<br>
An additional advantage of a multi-stage compression<br>
installation according to the invention, in which the<br>
different compressors are controlled such that they are<br>
driven simultaneously, is that the quantity of gas to bo<br>
provided between the two compressors is comparatively<br>
minimal, since the consumption of compressed gas by one<br>
compressor can always be compensated for by supplying the<br>
compressed gas via the compressor of the preceding stage.<br>
This reduced quantity of gas to be provided between the<br>
different compressors of a multi-stage compressor according<br>
to the invention, compared to that of a known multi-stage<br>
compressor, is advantageous in that the first tank can bo<br>
made less voluminous and can even be omitted, which results<br>
in smaller and less expensive multi-stage compression<br>
installations.<br><br>
5<br>
Another advantage of a multi-stage compression installation<br>
according to the invention is that a single pressure sensor<br>
is sufficient for its control, whereas the known multi-<br>
stage compressors are equipped with a pressure sensor per<br>
compression stage.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
present invention, the following example of a high-pressure<br>
multi-stage compression installation according to the<br>
invention is represented as an example only without being<br>
limitative in any way, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 schematically represents a multi-stage<br>
compression installation according to the present.<br>
invention;<br>
figure 2 represents a variant according to figure 1.<br>
As represented in figure 1, a high-pressure multi-stage<br>
compression installation 1 according to the invention is<br>
mainly formed of a main gas pipe 2 which opens in a buffer<br>
3 and in which, in this case, two volumetric compressors A<br>
and 5 are mounted in series.<br>
The first compressor 4 is for example a screw-type<br>
compressor which serves as a low-pressure compression<br>
stage, whereas the second compressor 5, also called the<br>
excess pressure compressor, is for example a piston<br>
compressor which serves as high-pressure compression stage.<br><br>
6<br>
The above-mentioned buffer 3 can be made in the shape of a<br>
tank or the like, connected to a user network 6 and in<br>
which are preferably provided means 7 which make it<br>
possible to regulate the gas pressure prevailing in the<br>
tank, and which are connected to a control panel 8, for<br>
example an electronic panel.<br>
Naturally, the above-mentioned means 7 which are designed<br>
to regulate the pressure can also be mounted, if desired,<br>
at the output of the main pipe 2 or in the user network 6.<br>
As is known, the above-mentioned means 7 can be made in<br>
different forms, for example as a direct pressure measuring<br>
by means of a pressure gauge or by means of an algorithm<br>
which makes it possible to regulate the gas pressure in the<br>
buffer as a function of for example a temperature<br>
measurement.<br>
The above-mentioned compressors 4 and 5 are each<br>
respectively provided with a drive, 9 and 10 respectively,<br>
which are each connected to the above-mentioned control<br>
panel 8 and which are formed for example of electric motors<br>
or any other type of motors.<br>
Said compressors 4 and 5 are of the type which is driven at<br>
a fixed speed in this case, and they are preferably<br>
dimensioned such that, when they are each driven at their<br>
fixed driving speed, they wil1 both compress the same<br>
quantity of gas per time unit.<br>
Thus, the control panel 8 in this case functions as an<br><br>
7<br>
electronic transmission shaft so to say, linking the two<br>
compressors 4 and 5.<br>
The working of the multi-stage compressor according to the<br>
invention as described above is simple and as follows.<br>
The above-mentioned control panel 8 is provided with a<br>
control, such that when the gas pressure prevailing in the<br>
above-mentioned buffer 3 drops below a preset minimum<br>
value, the compressors 4 and 5 will be turned on, such that.<br>
they start compressing gas and such that the gas pressure<br>
prevailing in the buffer 3 can be restored again.<br>
As soon as the gas pressure prevailing in the buffer 3 has<br>
risen again and has acquired a maximum value which had been<br>
preset as well, the above-mentioned compressors 4 and 5 are<br>
put into idling again.<br>
Figure 2 represents a variant of a multi-stage compression<br>
installation 1 according to the invention in which the<br>
compressors 4 and 5 can be driven at a variable speed and<br>
in which the drives of the compressors 4 and 5 are coupled<br>
to one another by means of an electric cable 11 which in<br>
the case represented here goes through the control panel 8.<br>
In this case, the control provided in the controJ panel is<br>
such that the compressor 5 which forms the final excess<br>
pressure stage is driven at a speed which depends on the<br>
gas pressure prevailing in the buffer 3, whereas one or<br>
several other compressors 4 in the main pipe 2 are driven<br>
as a function of the driving speed of the above-mentioned<br><br>
8<br>
compressor 5.<br>
In this case, the control is preferably of the type whereby<br>
the two compressors 4 and 5 compress the same quantity of<br>
gas per time unit, such that the quantity of gas which is<br>
available in the main pipe 2 remains constant or<br>
practically constant between the two compressors 4 and 5 in<br>
case of a normal operation of the multi-stage compressor.<br>
Naturally, it is also possible to mount more than two<br>
compressors 4 in series in the above-mentioned main pipe 2,<br>
whereby each of said compressors 4 is provided with a drive<br>
which is connected to the control panel 8.<br>
It is clear that each of the compressors 4 and 5 can be<br>
realized as a single or as several compression elements<br>
connected in parallel or in series and being driven by one<br>
and the same drive.<br>
It goes without saying that the low-pressure stage and the<br>
high-pressure stage can be realized as two separate<br>
compressor groups which are electronically connected via a<br>
common control panel 8 or by means of a simple electronic<br>
cable which connects the control panels of each group.<br>
The present invention is by no means limited to the<br>
embodiments described above and represented in the<br>
accompanying drawings; a multi-stage high-pressure<br>
compression installation according to the invention can be<br>
made according to several variants while still remaining<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
