				<td>The present invention relates to a process of making vitreous coating composition<br>
suitable for yellow variety brass substrate.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process of making the formulation of a glass composition for coating the surfaces of brass of yellow variety composed of alkaline-lead-boro-silicate glassy phase. The glass composition can be applied on yellow variety brass substrate by simple and cost effective vitreous enamelling process as described hereinafter. The glassy coating provides environmental protection as well as scratch and impact resistance property to the metallic components viz. yellow variety brass to enhance the service life and aesthetic values as well as decorative items in doors, windows and costly metal vessels made of yellow variety brass. Vitreous enamel coatings or glass coatings on brass as well as copper are known to provide limited protection to this kind of metallic substrates, as reported in the articles, (1) "Art Enamelling on Metal", J. Minneman, Trans. Am. Ceram. Soc. 13 (1912) 514, only a treatise on art enamelling. (2) "The Production of Some White Enamels for Copper", R. R. Danielson and H. P. Reinecker, J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 4 (1921) 827-834, which deals with the development of some white enamels for copper substrate along with the effect of varying Na2O, PbO, Cryolite, SiO2 and B2O3 on the properties of the enamels. (3) "Auger Analysis of Brass-Enamel and Stainless Steel Enamel Interfaces", D. E. Clark, C. G. Pantano, Jr. and G. Y. Onoda, Jr., J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 58 [7-8](1975)316-322, wherein dry fritted 80 mesh enamel (borosilicate) was sprinkled on to the specimens and isothermally fired at 843°C for 1 min to yield a smooth and homogeneous coating ~ 10 mils thick. (4) "Art Enamels for Copper", E. A. Yatsenko, A. M. Kondyurin, V. P. Ratkova and N. N. Tkachenko, Glass Ceram. 54[3-4](1997)93-95, wherein a single low melting glass matrix in the system R2O-PbO-B2O3-SiO2 (R = Na, K) on copper was applied by maturing at 680°-700°C. Drawbacks of the above processes are as follows:<br>
(1)	Although the thermal co-efficient of linear expansion of jewellery enamels are close<br>
to that of brass, since brass contains zinc in addition to copper, the sole enamel<br>
which was suitable for copper enamelling, are not suitable for enamelling of brass<br>
which contains zinc.<br>
(2)	The copper substrate are required to give a very light wash of the enamels ground in<br>
water to prevent excessive oxidation of metal during the firing process.<br>
(3)	The slow radiation of heat from the muffle walls and the highly oxidising conditions of<br>
the furnace atmosphere tend to excessive oxidation of copper before the enamel is<br>
fused.<br>
(4)	The substrate deformation up to 7% has also been reported.<br>
(5)	The manufacture of household pieces of art from non-ferrous metals decorated with<br>
jewellers' enamels is a   labour oriented and technologically complicated process.<br>
Existing colour jewellers' enamels are expensive and melt in a wide temperature<br>
interval (800°-950°C). Because of this, their use in a single piece of art is a<br>
challenging technological task and the manufacturing cost is high.<br>
After making literature and patent searches we have not been able to get, to the best of<br>
our knowledge any coating composition suitable for yellow variety brass.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of making vitreous<br>
coating composition suitable for yellow variety brass substrate.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an alkaline- lead- boro- silicate<br>
glassy phase in the matured composition.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide the glassy coating composition<br>
prepared in the form of a slip by wet milling process.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide scratch and impact resistant<br>
decorative coating against environmental abatements and to increase the service life of<br>
the metallic components made of yellow variety brass.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of<br>
vitreous coating for yellow variety brass substrate which can be coated at a relatively<br>
lower temperatures (800° to 850°C).<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coating composition which<br>
allows shorter time period of firing (3 to 5 min) so that the metal base i.e. yellow variety<br>
brass can be safely heated without any adverse effect on the metal surface.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a good adherent glassy coating<br>
material made of the above referred vitreous composition on yellow variety brass<br>
substrate which needs the composition of glassy phase must have a co-efficient of<br>
linear       thermal       expansion       matching       to       that       of       the       metal<br>
(yellow variety brass) to be coated so that the peeling or chipping of the glassy coating<br>
do not occur from the brass substrate.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the adherence property<br>
achieved by considering oxide factors of the composition of glassy phase and is so<br>
formulated that their co-efficient of linear thermal expansion matches with that of the<br>
metallic substrate viz. yellow variety brass.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making vitreous<br>
coating composition for surfaces of metallic components made of yellow variety brass<br>
which is economic, scratch and impact resistant against environmental abatements.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of making vitreous coating<br>
composition suitable for yellow variety brass substrate which comprises mixing quartz<br>
20.0 to 21.2 wt%, sodium nitrate 20.0 to 21.4 wt%, potassium carbonate 4.8 to 5.8 wt%,<br>
calcium carbonate 3.6 to 4.3 wt%, anhydrous alumina 0.4 to 0.8 wt%, boric acid 9.2 to<br>
10.2 wt%, arsenious oxide 2.8 to 3.5 wt% and litharge 32.8 to 39.2 wt% by known<br>
processes, melting the said mixture at a temperature in the range of 1200 to 1250<br>
degree C, pouring the melted mixture into water kept at room temperature to obtain a<br>
fritted glass, mixing 62.04 to 68.66 wt% of the fritted glass so obtained with 1.24 to 2.17<br>
wt% suspending agent, 0.03 to 0.06 wt% electrolyte, 2.40 to 4.34 wt%, maturing range<br>
promoter, 0.17 to 0.31 wt% adhering agent, 0.03 to 0.06 wt% water soluble organic<br>
polymer and 27.46 to 31.02 wt% iron free water by conventional method, milling the<br>
mixture to -250 to -300 mesh size [B.S. sieve] to obtain the vitreous coating composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the raw materials used for making glass frit<br>
are of commercial grade. In an embodiment of the present invention the suspending agent used may be such as china clay, kaolin, bentonite of commercial grade.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the electrolyte used may be such as<br>
barium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride of commercial grade.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the maturing range promoter used<br>
may be such as quartz, colloidal silica, precipitated silica of commercial grade.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the adhering agent used may be<br>
such as cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, manganese dioxide of commercial grade.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the water soluble organic polymer<br>
used may be such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol of commercial grade.<br>
The process steps of the present invention are:<br>
1.	A batch material (500g) is prepared by mixing the ingredients thoroughly as given in the following table,<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
2.	The above mixture was melted at a temperature in the range of 1200°-1250°C.<br>
3.	The molten material was quenched by pouring the said liquid into water kept at room<br>
temperature to obtained a frit.<br>
4.	The above stated 100 g of fritted glass was properly mixed with the following<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
5. Said mixture was milled to -250 to -300 mesh size ( B.S. sieve ) to get the vitreous coating material in the form of a slip.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in preparing a novel coating composition suitable for yellow variety brass substrate, for which to the best of our knowledge there is no known vitreous coating on yellow variety brass substrate. The inventive steps is in preparing alkaline-lead-borosilicate glassy phase in the frit form which is suitable for making a coating slurry for application on a yellow variety brass substrate. The vitreous coating composition of the present invention is suitable for application on yellow variety brass substrate which contains zinc in addition to copper and as a result known vitreous enamel coating can not be applied on yellow variety brass substrate. The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

16 g arsenious oxide (As2O3)<br>
3 g anhydrous alumina (AI2O3)<br>
175 g litharge (yellow, PbO)<br>
The above stated batch material was melted at 1200°C in oxidising atmosphere and subsequently the molten mass was quenched in iron free water to obtain glass flakes called "Frit". This frit (100 g) was milled along with other mill additives viz. , clay 2 g, cobalt oxide 0.3 g, barium chloride 0.06 g, water soluble organic polymer 0.06 g, quartz 4 g and iron free water 40 g, to obtain a slurry having particle size -250 mesh (B.S. sieve).

The above stated batch material was melted at 1250°C in oxidising atmosphere and subsequently the molten mass was quenched in iron free water to obtain glass flakes called "Frit". This frit (100 g) was milled along with other mill additives viz. , clay 3 g, cobalt oxide 0.45 g, barium chloride 0.08 g, water soluble organic polymer 0.08 g, quartz 6 g and iron free water 50 g, to obtain a slurry having particle size -300 mesh (B.S. sieve). The same slurry was used for coating the surfaces of yellow variety brass substrate.<br>
Results of the properties obtained with the coated articles made from the invented coating composition is given in the table below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The main advantages of this invention are :<br>
1.	The thin vitreous coating  composition as described earlier can be used for coating<br>
yellow variety brass surfaces by conventional vitreous enamelling technique which is simple and cost effective as compared to hitherto known processes.<br>
2.	Repeated melting of the above said composition (glass frit) tends to promote opacity<br>
and to eliminate dissolved gases.<br>
3.	Properties can be tailored by adjusting composition (glass frit) of the coated articles.<br>
4.	Controlled use of sodium oxide and arsenic maintain the desired property of opacity<br>
without affecting gloss of coating material with least health hazard<br>
5.	Tendency to "over smelt" may be controlled by using sodium oxide and arsenic oxide.<br>
6.	Controlled use of sodium oxide and boric oxide combination reduce the tendency of<br>
attacking copper.<br>
7.	The present vitreous coating system provides a good adherence on yellow variety<br>
brass surfaces with fairly high thickness ( 80-100).<br><br><br><br><br>
