"METER SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br><br>
The   following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it .is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a meter system for.<br>
a vehicle, which is operated to display a vehicle speed	—<br>
during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the vehicle. More specifically, the present invention relates to a meter system for a vehicle, which is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the vehicle, wherein a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, the display information is switched when the<br>
2<br><br>
classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, and input set-up of the display information is performed by a switch. [Prior Art]<br>
A meter system for a vehicle is known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 53-134354 entitled "Digital Display Unit for Automobile".<br>
The technique described in the above-described document relates to a digital display unit for an automobile.  Referring to FIG. 1 of this document, the digital display unit includes a vehicle speed signal generator 1 (this and later reference numerals are cited from the above document) for generating a vehicle speed signal, a time signal generator 2 for generating a time signal, a stoppage signal generator 3 for detecting stoppage of a vehicle and generating a stoppage signal of the vehicle, a display switching unit 5 for switching a signal on the basis of information obtained from the vehicle speed signal generator 1, the time signal generator 2, and the stoppage signal generator 3 in such a manner that the signal is switched to the vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and is switched to the time signal during stoppage of the vehicle, and a display unit 6 for displaying a vehicle speed or the present time on<br>
3<br><br>
the basis of an output from the display switching unit 5.<br>
A meter system for a vehicle has been known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 7-180602 entitled "Control Unit for Vehicle".<br>
The technique disclosed in this document relates to a control unit for a vehicle, which includes, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 16 of this document, a controller 386 (reference numeral is cited from this document) for controlling starting/stopping of an engine, and a card key 424 in which information to be supplied to the controller 386 is written, wherein the card key 424 is provided with an IC card 436 as storage means for storing control data, and a signal receiving power generating coil 438 and a signal transmitting communication coil 440 as data re-writing means.<br>
As display units for displaying information of a vehicle, there are known liquid crystal display units mounted on vehicles. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-118527 discloses a liquid crystal display unit for displaying various kinds of driving information, for example, vehicle information such as a running speed, navigation information, and VICS information.  This display unit is intended to easily decide the presence or absence of abnormality of an engine by switching a color<br><br>
                            4<br><br>
of backlight between a normal state and an abnormal state of a display signal required for displaying vehicle information and driving information.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described digital display unit for an automobile displays a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and also displays the present time during stoppage of the vehicle. Accordingly, since the display unit displays a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle, it can play an essential role of a digital display unit for an automobile (hereinafter, referred to as "meter system for a vehicle"); however, since the display unit displays only the present time during stoppage of the vehicle, the level of concern of a driver on the meter system for a vehicle during stoppage of the vehicle becomes weak and thereby the driver"s observation on the meter system for a vehicle during stoppage of the vehicle becomes less frequent, with a result that usability of the meter system for a vehicle may be degraded.<br>
Accordingly, it is expected to develop a meter system for a vehicle intended to improve serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
A first object of the present invention is to<br><br>
                     5<br><br>
provide a technique capable of making effective use of a meter system for a vehicle by displaying a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and switching the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
The above control unit for a vehicle is configured such that the signal receiving power generating coil 438 and the signal transmitting communication coil 440 provided for the card key 424 are used for re-writing data of the controller 386.  However, depending on a quality and an amount of data, the data can be selected and determined by an easier manner.<br>
It is thus expected to provide means of selecting and determining data (hereinafter, referred to as "display information") by an easier manner.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide a meter system for a vehicle, which is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the vehicle, characterized by simply performing input set-up of the display information.<br><br>
                          6<br><br>
There are various kinds of information expressing states of a vehicle. Further, along with development of the recent computer processing technique, information other than that directly expressing states of a vehicle, for example, time information or weather information has come to be displayed on a liquid crystal display unit mounted on the vehicle.  To improve a visibility of such various information, it is desirable to display the information in color. However, a color liquid crystal display unit has a problem that since the cost is generally high and a usable temperature region is narrow, the color liquid display unit cannot be widely applied to all kinds of vehicles including small-sized motorcycles. Accordingly, it is expected to develop a technique capable of displaying a large amount of information on a monochrome liquid crystal display unit with a good visibility.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display unit for a vehicle, which is capable of improving visibility of display information on a monochrome liquid crystal display unit. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above first object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a meter<br>
7<br><br>
system for a vehicle, which is operated to display a vehicle speed by display means during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle, characterized in that a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another.<br>
It is advantageous, from the viewpoint of making effective use of the meter system for a vehicle, to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
Specifically, since only running information is displayed during running of the vehicle, a driver can easily recognize the information, and the meter system for a vehicle becomes compact.<br>
Since a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and<br><br>
                              8<br><br>
the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, a driver can enjoy recognizing various kinds of display information and take deep interest not only on the vehicle but also on the meter system for a vehicle. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, the vehicle is an idle stop vehicle in which an engine is stopped at the time of stoppage of the vehicle, and the display information is switched to a display indicating idle stop on the basis of such information that the classified vehicle stoppage state is an idle stop state.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display indicating idle stop on the basis of such information that the classified vehicle stoppage state is an idle stop state, a driver can easily recognize that the vehicle is in the operational state although there is no engine noise. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to the driver.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3, when the vehicle state is an insufficient fuel state, the display information is switched to a display of a message urging a driver to supply fuel.<br><br>
                          9<br><br>
Since the display information is switched to a display of a message urging a driver to supply fuel when the vehicle state is an insufficient fuel state, a driver can certainly recognize the vehicle state and readily take appropriate steps.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 4, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which the vehicle is left stopped during rotation of an engine, the display information is switched to a display of a residual amount of fuel.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display of a residual amount of fuel when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which the vehicle is left stopped during rotation of an engine, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 5, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state, a display of date of a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday, or a display of the present time.<br>
When the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and<br><br>
                              10<br><br>
before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state such as a vehicle state immediately after fuel is supplied, a display of date of a specified day represented by Christmas day or Valentine day or a memorial day such  as a driver"s birthday, or a display of the present time, represented by "Good Morning".<br>
That is to say, since the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state, a display of date of a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday, or a display of the present time so as to take communication between a driver before the vehicle runs and the vehicle, a driver can keep deep interest on the vehicle.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 6, the date of a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday or the present time is settable as the display information.<br>
Since a birthday or the present time is settable as the display information, it is possible to improve various kinds of serviceability to a driver.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 7, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before<br>
11<br><br>
the vehicle runs, or after the main switch is turned off, the display information is switched to a display indicating a summation of vehicle stoppage time.<br>
When the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch  is   turned on  and before the vehicle runs, or after the main switch is turned off, the display information is switched to a display indicating a summation of vehicle stoppage time, for example, in the case where the vehicle has been not used for a long period of time. Accordingly, a driver can easily store a running distance in mind and enhance intent to drive the vehicle. Further, the driver can further urge intent to drive the vehicle when receiving a display of thanking the driver for his or her labor after long-distance running of the vehicle.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 8, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display of a running distance.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display of a running distance when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, a driver can<br><br>
                          12<br><br>
easily store a running distance in mind.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 9, the display of a running distance is a display of a character arbitrarily selected from a plurality of display patterns and a numerical value.<br>
The display of a running distance is expressed by a character and a numerical value. Specifically, a plurality of display patterns by combination of displays of characters and numerical values are prepared, and a suitable one of the plurality of display patterns can be selected.<br>
That is to say, since a character and a numerical value can be arbitrarily selected from a plurality of display patterns, a driver can more strongly enjoy looking at the meter system and more certainly store a display of a running distance in mind.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 10, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which a main switch is turned off, the display information is switched to maintenance information of the vehicle, or a brand name and a mark of the vehicle.<br>
Accordingly, a driver can receive strong impression on a maintenance timing of the vehicle, and keep a good vehicle state.  Further, a brand identity can be enhanced<br><br>
                         13<br><br>
by the display of a brand name and a mark.<br>
To achieve the above second object, according to an invention described in claim 11, input set-up of the display information is performed by a switch, and the switch is operated by brake levers of the vehicle.<br>
It is advantageous, from the viewpoint of making effective use of the meter system for a vehicle, to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the Vehicle.<br>
At this time, the display of information other than the present time is advantageous for calling a driver"s attention to the meter system for a vehicle during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
It is also advantageous to easier perform input set-up of display information.<br>
Accordingly, the meter system for a vehicle is configured such that a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, the display information is Switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is Switched from one to<br><br>
                           14<br><br>
another, and input set-up of the display information is performed by a switch, wherein the switch is operated by brake levers of the vehicle.<br>
With this configuration, since a stoppage state of the vehicle is  classified  into vehicle  stoppage  states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, the meter system for a vehicle can be effectively used.  Further, since input set-up of the display information is performed by a switch, and the switch is operated by brake levers of the vehicle, it is possible to make effective use an already provided switch, that is, without the need of provision of a specialized switch which has been provided for time adjustment (at a position near the meter), and hence to keep a desirable appearance, reduce the cost, and improve the operability of input set-up.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 12, the switch is turned on by turning on left and right brake levers and a main switch of the vehicle, to allow a mode of the input set-up to be displayed.<br>
Since the switch is turned on by turning on left and right brake levers and a main switch of the vehicle,<br><br>
                             15<br><br>
to allow a mode of the input set-up to be displayed, the switch can serve as that for lighting a stop lamp.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 13, the switch selects one term from the mode of the input set-up of the display information by operating the left brake lever, and determines the selected term by operating the right brake lever.<br>
Since the switch selects one term from the mode of the input set-up of the display information by operating the left brake lever, and determines the selected term by operating the right brake lever, it is possible to improve the operability of input set-up.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 14, a display of the display information switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens, and a display of the vehicle speed is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens.<br>
Since the display of information and the display of the vehicle speed can be selected according to a user"s preference, it is possible to improve the usability of the meter system for a vehicle.  Since the display information and the display of the vehicle speed are<br>
16<br><br>
selected by operating the brake levers, it is possible to easily select the display screen.<br>
To achieve the above third object, according to an invention described in claim 15, the display means is a liquid crystal display unit, which has a liquid crystal portion capable of switchingly displaying a plurality of kinds of information on the basis of a display information signal inputted from external, including: a color light source for illuminating the liquid crystal portion with backlight; and a driver for selecting a color of backlight corresponding to a display content switched in response to the display information signal, and switching a color of light emitted from the color light source on the basis of the selected color of backlight.<br>
Consequently, since the color of backlight is changed in accordance with switching of a display content, it is possible to improve a visibility of monochrome display information displayed on the liquid crystal portion, even if the liquid crystal portion is mounted on a motorcycle whose temperature is liable to be raised, by illuminating the liquid crystal portion with backlight of a color switched on the basis of the display information.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 16, a<br><br>
                        17<br><br>
plurality of the color light sources are provided, and a region of the liquid crystal portion illuminated by each of the plurality of light sources is predetermined, and the driver selects a color of backlight corresponding to information to be displayed on  each region and  switches a color of light emitted from each color light source on the basis of the selected color of backlight.<br>
Consequently, since the color of backlight is changed for each region on the liquid crystal portion, in the case of simultaneously displaying a plurality of kinds of information on the liquid crystal portion, the regions on which the plurality of kinds of information are displayed can be individually illuminated with light of different colors.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 17, the plurality of color light sources are previously set so as to correspond to a plurality of regions set on the liquid crystal portion, and light guiding means is provided for guiding light outputted from each of the plurality of color light sources in such a manner that one of the plurality of regions corresponding to each color light source is illuminated with light outputted from each color light source. With the third feature, regions set on the liquid crystal portion are<br><br>
                              18<br><br>
individually illuminated with backlight of colors which are clearly distinguished from each other.<br>

FIG. 5(f) shows an ending screen emerging immediately after the main switch is turned off.  The ending screen has a display of a message "bye-bye" and a display of the present time.<br>
That is to say, each of FIGS. 5(a) to 5(f) shows a display screen of the meter system for a vehicle, which<br><br>
                              34<br><br>
system is configured to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the vehicle.  Such a display screen is in the form of either of the opening screen, the driving screen, and the ending screen.<br>
A method of detecting a driving state for changing the display screen to either of the opening screen, the driving screen, and the ending screen will be described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a chart showing a method of detecting a driving state on the basis of which a display screen emerges on the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.  In the figure, the abscissa designates time and the ordinate designates a battery voltage (Hi-Lo state) and an idle stop signal (Hi-Lo state). The battery voltage and the idle stop signal are detected by the control unit 39 (see FIG. 1) and are supplied from the control unit 39 to the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3).<br>
On the basis of such information that the battery voltage is in the Hi state and the idle stop signal is in the Lo state, the control unit 62 (see FIG. 3) of the<br>
35<br><br>
meter system 60 for a vehicle decides the driving state as a state immediately after the main switch is turned on and before the engine is started, and changes the display screen to the opening screen.<br>
On   the basis  of such  information   that   the battery voltage is in the Hi state and the idle stop signal is in the Hi state, the control unit 62 (see Fig. 3) of the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) decides the driving state as a state in which the vehicle is on running and changes the display screen to the driving screen. On the basis of such information that the battery voltage is in the Hi state and the idle stop signal is in the Hi and Lo states, the control unit 62 of the meter system 60 for a vehicle decides the driving state as a state in which the vehicle is on running with idle stop, and changes the display screen to the driving screen having a display indicating idle stop.<br>
In the ON state of the main switch, when a signal from the speed sensor 55 is inputted in the meter system 60 for a vehicle, each of the opening screen and the driving screen immediately displays a vehicle speed.  In this case, the opening screen is changed to the driving state.  Even when the vehicle is manually moved by a driver, a vehicle speed is displayed.<br><br>
                           36<br><br>
On the basis of such information that the battery voltage is in the Lo state and the idle stop signal is in the Lo state, the control unit 62 (see FIG. 3} of the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) decides the driving state as a state in which the main switch is turned off and changes the display screen to the ending screen.<br>
The flow of the process executed by the meter system for a vehicle described above will be described with reference to FIGS. 7 to 10.  It is to be noted that in these figures, character STXXX designates a step number.<br>
FIG. 7 is a main flow diagram (front half) of the process executed by the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.<br>
In step ST101, the main switch of the vehicle is turned on.  In this case, although the main switch is turned on, the vehicle is in the stoppage state.<br>
In step ST102, it is decided whether or not signals are inputted from the left and right brake switches.  If NO, the process goes on to step ST103 while if YES, the process goes on to step ST104.<br>
In step ST103, an opening screen having display information emerges.  This display information on the<br><br>
                              37<br><br>
opening screen will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10.<br>
In step ST104, a set-up screen emerges. A method of determining the set-up screen will be fully described with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
In step ST105, the engine is started.<br>
In step ST106, it is decided whether or not the main switch is in the ON state.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST107 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST112.<br>
In step ST107, it is decided whether or not the vehicle speed is less than zero (vehicle speed 
In step ST108, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is an engine abnormal state (whether or not an engine abnormality signal is present).  If YES, the process goes on to step ST109 while if NO, the process goes on to "C" shown in FIG. 8.<br>
In step ST109, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is an insufficient fuel state.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST110 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST111.<br>
In step ST110, a screen having a display of a<br><br>
                     38<br><br>
message "Abnormality is Present in Engine" and a screen having a message "Feed Gasoline" repeatedly emerges, and the process is returned to "A"<br>
In step ST111, the display screen is changed to a display screen having a message "Abnormality is Present in Engine", and the process is returned to "A".<br>
In step ST112, the display screen is changed to an ending screen.<br>
In step ST113, it is decided whether or not a specific time has elapsed.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST113 while if NO, the process is returned to ST112.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3), which is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle, is configured such that a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another.<br>
It is advantageous, from the viewpoint of making effective use of the meter system 60 for a vehicle, to<br><br>
                               39<br><br>
display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
Specifically, since only running information is displayed during running of the vehicle, a driver can easily recognize the information, and the meter system for a vehicle becomes compact.<br>
Since a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, a driver can enjoy recognizing various kinds of display information and take deep interest not only on the vehicle but also on the meter system for a vehicle.  As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
FIG. 8 is a main flow diagram (rear half) of the process executed by the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.<br>
In step ST114, it is decided whether or not the vehicle speed exceeds 30 km/h.  If No, the process goes on to step ST115 while if YES, the process goes on to step<br><br>
                               40<br><br>
ST116.<br>
In step ST115, if the LED specialized to warn over-speed is flashing, it lights out, and the process goes on to step ST117.<br>
In  step  ST116,    the  LED  specialized   to  warn  over-speed  is flashed.<br>
In step ST117, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is in an engine abnormal state (whether or not an engine abnormality signal is present).  If YES, the process goes on to step ST118 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST121.<br>
In step ST118, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is in an insufficient fuel state.  If YES, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST119 while if NO, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST120.<br>
In step ST119, since the vehicle is on running, a driving screen having a display of a vehicle speed and a display of the present time emerges; since the vehicle state is in the engine abnormal state, a symbol mark indicating abnormality of the engine is flashed; and since the vehicle state is in the insufficient fuel state, a symbol mark indicating supply of fuel is flashed. The process is then returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.]<br><br>
                              41<br><br>
In step ST120, since the vehicle is on running, a driving screen having a display of a vehicle speed and a display of the present time emerges, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST121, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is in an insufficient fuel state.  If YES, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST122 while if NO, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST123, and the process is returned to "A shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST122, in addition to an usual driving screen, the symbol mark indicating supply of fuel is flashed because the vehicle state is in the insufficient fuel state, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST123, since the vehicle state is in the engine normal state and the vehicle state is in the fuel sufficient state, a usual driving screen having a display of a vehicle speed and a display of the present time emerges.<br>
In step ST124, it is decided whether or not an idle stop state is detected as the vehicle stoppage state. If YES, the process goes on to step ST125 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST128.<br><br>
                            42<br><br>
In step ST125 it.,is decided whether or not the vehicle state is in an insufficent  fuel state.  If YES, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST126 while if NO, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST127, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST126, since the vehicle stoppage state is in the idle stop state, a symbol mark indicating the idle stop is displayed, and since the vehicle state is in the insufficient fuel state, the symbol mark indicating supply of fuel is flashed, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST127, since the vehicle stoppage state is in the idle stop state, the symbol mark indicating the idle stop is displayed.<br>
The meter system for a vehicle is configured such that the vehicle is an idle stop vehicle in which an engine is stopped at the time of stoppage of the vehicle, and the display information is switched to a display indicating idle stop on the basis of such information that the classified vehicle stoppage state is an idle stop state.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display indicating idle stop on the basis of such<br><br>
                             43<br><br>
information that the classified vehicle stoppage state is an idle stop state, it is possible to improve serviceability to the driver.<br>
In step ST128, it is decided whether or not the vehicle state is in an insufficient fuel state. If YES, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST129 while if NO, the display screen is changed to a display screen in step ST130.<br>
In step ST129, since the vehicle state is in the insufficient state, a combination of flashing of the symbol mark indicating supply of fuel and a display of a caution message "Feed Gasoline", and a combination of flashing of a symbol mark indicating supply of fuel and a display of a symbol mark "RES" for urging a driver to supply fuel are alternated, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.  The abbreviation "RES" stands for "RESERVE".<br>
In step ST130, since the vehicle state is in the sufficient fuel state, a symbol mark indicating a residual state of fuel is displayed, and the process is returned to "A" shown in FIG. 7.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is configured such that when the vehicle state is an insufficient fuel state, the display information is<br><br>
                              44<br><br>
switched to a display of a message urging a driver to supply fuel.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display of a message urging a driver to supply fuel when the vehicle state is an insufficient fuel state, a driver can certainly recognize the vehicle state and readily take appropriate steps.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is thus characterized in that when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which the vehicle is left stopped during rotation of an engine, the display information is switched to a display of a residual amount of fuel.<br>
Since the display information is switched to a display of a residual amount of fuel when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which the vehicle is left stopped during rotation of an engine, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow diagram (front half) of a process of making the opening screen emerge on the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.  This flow is details of the flow in step ST103 shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In step ST201, the present residual amount of fuel is read out for checking the vehicle state.<br><br>
                              45<br><br>
In step ST201, the previous fuel information, that is, the residual amount of fuel at the time of previous OFF state of the main switch is read out for checking the vehicle state.<br>
In step ST203, it is decided whether or not the previous residual amount of fuel is inputted.  If NO, that is, if the previous fuel information is not inputted, the process is returned to step ST202 while if YES, that is, if the previous fuel information is inputted, the process goes on to step ST204.<br>
In step ST204, it is decided whether or not the present residual amount of fuel becomes larger than the previous residual amount of fuel.  If YES, that is, if the present residual amount of fuel becomes larger than the previous residual amount of fuel, it is decided that supply of fuel is performed, and the process goes on to step ST205.  If NO, that is, if the present residual amount of fuel is not changed from the previous residual amount of fuel, it is decided that supply of fuel is not performed, and the process goes on to step ST214.<br>
In step ST205, a message "Thank You" and today"s date are displayed.<br>
In step ST206, it is decided whether or not an engine start signal is present.  If NO, the process goes<br><br>
                              46<br><br>
on to step ST207 while if YES, the process goes on to step ST213.<br>
In step ST207, it is decided whether or not the main switch is turned on.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST208 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST213.<br>
In step ST208, it is decided whether or not three seconds have elapsed since the above screen (in step ST205) emerged.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST209 while if NO, the process is returned to step ST205.<br>
In step ST209, a running distance is displayed in the form of a character and a numerical value and the present time is displayed.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is thus characterized in that when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after the main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, display information is changed to a display of a running distance.<br>
Since display information is changed to a display of a running distance when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after the main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the meter system 60 for a vehicle allows a driver to easily store the running distance.<br>
In step ST210, it is decided whether or not an <br><br>
                        47<br><br>
engine start signal is present in the vehicle stoppage state.  If YES, the process goes on to step ST211 while if NO, the process goes on to step ST212.<br>

The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is thus characterized in that when the classified vehicle<br>
52<br><br>
stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state, a display of date of a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday, or a display of the present time.<br>
When the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state such as a vehicle state immediately after fuel is supplied, a display of date of a specified day represented by Christmas day or Valentine day or a memorial day such as a driver"s birthday, or a display of the present time, represented by "Good Morning".<br>
That is to say, since the display information is switched to a display indicating a vehicle state, a display of date of a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday, or a display of the present time so as to take communication between a driver before the vehicle runs and the vehicle, a driver can keep interest on the vehicle for a long-time.<br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram (part 1) illustrating one example of a procedure of selecting and determining a set-up screen of the meter system for a vehicle according<br><br>
             53            <br><br>
to the present invention.  This procedure is a set-up procedure used in ST104 shown in FIG. 7.<br>
An input set-up mode screen (a) emerges by holding the left brake lever 32L and then locking the left brake lever 52L WITH a brake lever locking mechanism (not shown), and holding the right brake lever 52R with one hand and turning on the main switch 34 (see FIG. 1) with the other hand.  Since the input set-up mode screen (a) emerges by the operation different from a usual user"s turn-on operation of the main switch 34 as described above, the input set-UP mode screen is not usually or accidentally displayed. This is advantageous in usability of the meter system for a vehicle.<br>
Each when the left brake switch 53L is turned on by operating the left brake lever 52L, terms "Set-up of Date and Time", "Set-up of Your Birthday", "Reset of Oil Maintenance", and "End of Set-up" are repeated in this order. A desired one of these terms is determined by turning on the right brake switch 53R by operating the right brake lever 52R when the desired term is displayed.<br>
According to the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3), a specified day or a memorial day such as a birthday and the present time or day are settable as display information.<br><br>
Since display information such as a birthday and the present day is settable, it is possible to improve the usability of the meter system.<br>
The mode for set-up of date and time is determined by selecting, on the mode screen (a), the term "Set-up of Date and Time" and turning on the right brake switch 53R by operating the right brake lever 52R, with a result that a screen (b) of the mode for set-up of data and time emerges. Terms "Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", and "Minute" are selected and determined in this order on the mode screen (b), and the screen is returned to the mode screen (a) and the term "End of Set-up" is selected and determined thereon, whereby the set-up of the terms "Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", and "Minute" is ended.<br>
The mode of set-up of a birthday is determined by selecting, on the mode screen (a), the term "Set-up of Your Birthday" and turning on the right brake switch 53R by operating the right brake lever 52R, with a result that a screen (c) of the mode for set-up of a birthday emerges. Terms "Month", and "Day" are selected and determined on the mode screen (c), and the screen is returned to the mode screen (a) and the term "End of Set¬up" is selected and determined thereon, whereby the set¬up of the terms "Month", and "Day" is ended.<br><br>
                              55<br><br>
The mode of reset of oil display is determined by selecting, on the mode screen (a), the term "Reset of Oil Maintenance" and turning on the right brake switch 53R by operating the right brake lever 52R, with a result that a screen (d) of the mode for set-up of oil display emerges. A term "YES" or "NO" is selected and determined on the mode screen (d), and then the screen is returned to the mode screen (a), and the term "End of Setup" is selected and determined thereon, whereby the set-up of the term "YES" or "NO" is ended.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3), which is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle, is characterized in that a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another.  In this meter system 60 for a vehicle, the input set-up of display information is performed by switches (the left and right brake switches 53L and 53R) operated the left and right brake levers 52L and 52R.<br><br>
                             55<br><br>
It is advantageous, from the viewpoint of making effective use of the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3), to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and change the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle such as time display.<br>
At this time, if display information other than time display is displayed, there can be obtained an advantage of more certainly calling a driver" attention to the meter system during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
It is also advantageous that the input set-up of display information can be easily performed.<br>
Specifically, according to this embodiment, a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, wherein the input set-up of the display information is performed by the switches (the left and right brake switches 53L and 53R) operated by the left and right brake levers 52L and 52R of the vehicle.<br>
That is to say, since display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is<br>
56<br><br>
switched from one to another, the meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) can be effectively used by a driver. Since the switches for performing the input set-up of display information are operated by the left and right brake levers 52L and 52R, it is possible to reduce the cost of the meter system and to improve the usability of the meter system upon input set-up of display information. For example, a specialized switch for time-adjustment of a watch has been provided (in the vicinity of the meter) in the prior art system; however, according to this embodiment, since the switches (left and right brake switches 53L and 53R) provided for another purpose serves as those for input set-up of display information, the appearance of the vehicle is not changed.<br>
As a result, according to the meter system 60 for a vehicle, it is possible to improve the serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle and to shorten a time required for input set-up of display information.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is also configured, as described above, such that the input set-up mode is displayed by turning on the left and right brake levers 52L and 52R and the main switch 34 of the vehicle (see FIG. 1) .<br>
Since the input set-up mode is displayed by turning<br><br>
                       57<br><br>
on the left and right brake levers 52L and 52R and the main switch 34 of the vehicle (see FIG. 1), the switches for lighting the stop lamp 57 (see FIG. 1) can serve as those for input setTup. As a result, it is possible to simplify the structure of the vehicle and reduce the cost of the vehicle.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is also configured such that one term is selected from the input set-up mode for display information by the left brake lever 52L via the left brake switch 53L and the selected term is determined by the right brake lever 52R via the right brake switch 53R.<br>
Since one term is selected from the input set-up mode for display information by the left brake lever 52L and the selected term is determined by the right brake lever 52R, it is possible to improve the operability of the input set-up, and hence to shorten a time required for input set-up.<br>
By selecting, on the mode screen (a), a term "to Next Screen" with the left brake lever 52L and turning on the right brake switch 53R by operating the right brake lever 52R, the term "to Next Screen" is determined. As a result, the screen is changed to "Next Screen" shown in FIGS. 12(a) to 12 (f) .<br>
58<br><br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram (Part 1) illustrating one example of a procedure of selecting and determining a set-up screen of the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.<br>
When a term "Switch Character Expressing Vehicle Speed" is selected and determined on the mode screen (a), a mode screen (b) is displayed.  On the mode screen (b) , a term "Normal", "Retro", or "Digital" can be selected and determined.<br>
If the term "Digital" is selected, then a screen (c) of a digital mode is displayed, and if the term "Retro" is selected, there a screen (d) of a retro mode is displayed.  The screen is then returned to the mode screen (a).  Accordingly, the display of the vehicle speed can be selected according to a user"s preference.<br>
When a term "to Previous Screen" is selected on the mode screen (a), the screen is returned to the mode screen (a) shown in FIG. 11. When the term "End Set-up" is selected and determined on the mode screen (a) shown in FIG. 11, the set-up is ended.<br>
When a term "Switch Greeting Message" is selected and determined on the mode screen (a), a mode screen (e) is displayed. On the mode screen (e) , a term "the Kanto District", "the Kansai District", or "the Kyushu<br><br>
                             59                           <br><br>
District" can be selected and determined.<br>
If the term "the Kanto District" is selected, the screen (f) is displayed, on which a Kansai dialect message "Ohayousan" (which means "good morning"), "Gasoline Ireteya" (which means "feed gasoline"), or "Hona, Sainara" (which means "good-bye") emerges.  In addition, if the term "the Kyushu District" is selected, a Kyushu dialect message emerges on a display screen.<br>
Since the display information is selectable from a plurality of display screens as described above, it is possible to enhance a driver"s interest on the meter system for a vehicle.<br>
When a term "to Previous Screen" is selected on the mode screen (a), the screen is returned to the mode screen (a) shown in FIG. 11. When the term "End Set-up" is selected and determined on the mode screen (a) shown in FIG. 11, the set-up is ended.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 2) is thus configured such that a display of the display information switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens, and a display of the vehicle speed is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens.<br><br>
                              60<br><br>
That is to say, a plurality of display screens are previously prepared and a display of the display information switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another is selectable from the plurality of previously prepared display screens, and a plurality of display screens are previously prepared, and a display of the vehicle speed is selectable from the plurality of previously prepared display screens.<br>
Accordingly, the display information and the display of a vehicle speed can be selected according to a driver"s preference.  This makes it possible to improve the usability of the meter system 60 for a vehicle. Also, since the display information and the display of a vehicle speed are selected by operating the brake levers 52L and 52R (see FIG. 12), it is possible to easily select the display screen.<br>
The above-described display screen of the meter system for a vehicle will be described below.<br>

It is to be noted that the odd display screens shown in FIGS. 19(a) to 19(e) are displayed in precedence to the odd display screens shown in FIG. 15(a) to 18(j) and are each display once in the case the running distance exceeds the above-described attained running distance when the main switch is turned on. With this display of the attained running distance, it is possible for a driver to obtain the feeling of attainment, and to increase the attractiveness of the product.<br>
FIGS. 20(a) to 20(g) are diagrams each illustrating an ending screen of the meter system for a vehicle according to the present invention.  Such an ending screen is the screen emerged in step ST213 of FIG. 9.<br>
On the ending screen shown in FIG. 20(a), a residual amount of fuel is displayed, which is shift to a display shown in FIG. 20(b) after three seconds.<br>
On the ending screen shown in FIG. 20(b), if the running distance is equal to or more than 15 km, a message "Many Thanks for Your Drive !" is displayed; if<br><br>
                            70<br><br>
the main switch is turned between AM 4:00 to AM 10:00, a message "See-you" is displayed; and in the case other than the above, a message "bye-bye" is displayed, which is shifted to a display shown in FIG. 20(c) after 1.5 seconds.  This exhibits an effect of heeling a tired mood caused by running, and obtaining a sense of attainment at the time of turn of the power source.<br>
On the ending screen shown in FIG. 20(c), a message of informing a driver of an oil exchange timing, "Oil Exchange" is displayed, which is shifted to a display shown in FIG. 20(d) after 1.5 second.<br>
The above message can be reset as described above, and is initially displayed when the running distance exceeds 1000 km, and is then repeatedly displayed at intervals of 6000 km.<br>
On the ending screen shown in FIG. 20(d), a message of informing a driver of a periodical inspection timing, "Periodical Inspection", is displayed and is shifted to a display shown in FIG. 20(d) after 1.5 seconds.<br>
The above message is initially displayed after 30 days since the running distance has exceeded 5 km, and is automatically reset after the display is repeated by 10 times. After that, the display is repeated at intervals of six months (180 days).<br>
71<br><br>
On the ending screen shown in FIG. 20(e), a brand name or a logo mark (registered trade name) is.displayed, followed by ending after two seconds.<br>
Since personified maintenance information is displayed, a driver"s impression given from the maintenance information becomes gentle, so that it is possible for the driver to desirably perform maintenance.<br>
The meter system 60 for a vehicle (see FIG. 3) is thus configured such that maintenance information of the vehicle or a brand name or mark of the vehicle is changed when the main switch is kept as turned off in the vehicle stoppage state.<br>
Accordingly, the maintenance timing of the vehicle can be deeply impressed on a driver"s heat, so that it is possible for the driver to keep a desirable vehicle state, and since a brand name or mark of the vehicle is displayed, it is possible to enhance the brand identity of the vehicle.<br>

FIG. 29 is a front view of an essential portion of a liquid crystal display unit 460 used for a meter system for a vehicle of the present invention, and FIG. 30 is a sectional side view of the liquid crystal display unit 460 shown in FIG. 29. As shown in the figures, three sets of the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 are provided on each of the left and right sides of the liquid crystal portion 463.  Each of the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 on each of the left and right sides has LED elements of three pieces at maximum. A plurality of the LED elements thus provided are configured to emit light of<br><br>
                           79<br><br>
different colors and to be individually driven. Various colors of backlight can be obtained by individually driving the LED elements capable of emitting light of different colors.  The liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 are mounted on a board 469.  Light outputted from the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 is used for illuminating the liquid crystal portion 463 through light guide plates 474.  It is determined, by a content of a screen emerging on the liquid crystal portion 463, which of the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 should be driven.<br>
FIG. 31 is a flow chart showing a procedure of processing a display screen on the liquid crystal display unit 460.  If it is recognized that the main switch 434 is turned on in step S1, the process goes on to step S2 in which a display screen is processed on the basis of a display information signal.  For example, a vehicle speed is detected on the basis of an inputted speed pulse signal, and information for displaying a numerical value corresponding to the vehicle speed is read out of the ROM 473.  In step S3, a color of illuminating light, that is, backlight corresponding to the information to be displayed is selected. For example, if the vehicle speed is lower than a legal limit, then a green color of<br>
80<br><br>
backlight is selected; if the vehicle speed reaches the legal limit, then a yellow color of backlight is selected; and if the vehicles speed exceeds the legal limit, then an orange color of backlight is selected.  In step S4, the liquid crystal portion 463 is driven on the basis of the display information thus determined, and the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 are driven so as to obtain the selected color of backlight.<br>
Examples of displays on the liquid crystal display unit 460 will be described below.  It is to be noted that in the following examples of displays, a difference in color of backlight is expressed by a difference in density of a monochrome (white and black) for convenience of drawing practice.  FIG. 32 shows examples of displays of vehicle speeds.  In these examples of displays, the color of backlight is switched depending on where in pre¬determined regions the vehicle speed is located.  In the example, shown on the left side of FIG. 32, in which the vehicle speed is low (for example, 0 to 20 km/h), the color of backlight is set to green. In the example, shown at a central portion of FIG. 32, in which the vehicle speed is intermediate (for example, 21 to 30 km/h), the color of backlight is set to yellow.  In the example on the right side of FIG. 32, in which the vehicle speed is<br><br>
                           81<br><br>
high (for example, more than a legal limit), the color of backlight is set to orange.<br>
FIG. 33 shows examples of opening screens, that is, displays immediately after the main switch 434 is turned on.  In these examples of displays, the color of backlight is switched depending on a temperature of outside air. In the example on the left side of FIG. 33, in which the temperature of outside air is low (for example, 10C or less), the color of backlight is set to blue.  In the example at a central portion of FIG. 33, in which the temperature of outside air is intermediate (for example, 11 to 25°C) , the color of backlight is set to green.  In the example on the right side of FIG. 33, in which the temperature of outside air is high (for example, 26oC or more)/ the color of backlight is set to orange.<br>
FIG. 34 shows opening screens, in which the color of backlight is switched depending on emergence of an animated character,  in this case, it is configured that a previously set character emerges when the main switch is turned on.  In the example on the left side of FIG. 34, in which a character of a penguin is previously set, the color of backlight is set to blue.  In the example at a central portion of FIG. 34, in which a character of a frog is previously set, the color of backlight is set to<br><br><br>
                             82<br><br>
violet. In the example on the right side of FIG. 34, in which a character of a star is previously set, the color of backlight is set to yellow.<br>
FIG. 35 shows examples of displays functioning as fuel meters, in which the color of backlight is switched depending on a residual amount of fuel.  In the example on the left side of FIG. 35, in which a sufficient amount of fuel remains (full to one-second full), the color of backlight is set to green.  In the example at a central portion of FIG. 35, in which fuel is reduced from the sufficient state (one-fourth or less full), the color of backlight is set to yellow.  In the example on the right side of FIG. 35, in which only a slight amount of fuel remains and new fuel must be supplied, the color of backlight is set to orange.<br>
In the examples shown in FIGS. 32 to 35, the overall surface of the liquid crystal portion 463 is illuminated with backlight of the same color; however, according to this embodiment, predetermined regions of the liquid crystal portion 463 may be individually illuminated with backlight of different colors.<br>
FIG. 36 shows examples of displays, in each of which the display surface of the liquid crystal portion 463 is divided into upper, medium, and low regions, and<br>
83<br><br>
the three regions are individually illuminated with backlight of different colors.  In each of the examples shown in FIG. 36, a portion displaying an animated character (upper region), a portion displaying a running distance (medium region), and a portion displaying the present time (low region) are individually illuminated with backlight of different colors. The illumination of the regions with backlight of different colors shown in FIG. 36 may be performed by individually determining the turn-on of the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 disposed in three stages on each of the left and right sides of the liquid crystal portion 463.  In the case of selecting the color of backlight for illumination for each region, the colors of adjacent regions are mixed with each other at the boundary therebetween.  This brings an effect of giving gradation between different colors.<br>
The above-described illumination of the regions with backlight of different colors has the advantage caused by mixture of colors at the boundary between the adjacent regions; however, in some cases, it is required that adjacent regions having different colors are sharply separated from each other. A configuration to meet such a requirement will be described below.  FIG. 37 shows examples of illumination performed so as to form a clear<br>
84<br><br>
boundary between adjacent regions.  In the example on the left side of FIG. 37, colors of backlight are clearly distinguished from each other between an upper region and a lower region on the display surface of the liquid crystal portion 463.  In the example on the right side of FIG. 37, colors of backlight are clearly distinguished from each other between a region at an upper left corner and a remaining vehicle speed display region of the display surface of the liquid crystal portion 463.<br>
The above configuration to clearly distinguish colors of backlight between adjacent regions can be achieved as follows.  FIG. 38 is a front view of an essential portion of the liquid crystal portion 463 and its neighborhood. As shown in the figure, three sets of liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 are disposed on each of the left and right sides of the liquid crystal portion 463. A light guide plate 474 for guiding light outputted from each liquid crystal illuminating LED 464 to the liquid crystal portion 463 is provided between the liquid crystal illuminating LED 464 and the liquid crystal portion 463.  In this case, the light guide plate 474 is provided so as not to be common to the liquid crystal illuminating LEDs 464 on one of the left and right sides of the liquid crystal portion 463 but to correspond to a<br><br>
                         85<br><br>
region to be distinguished from another region in terms of color of backlight.  In the example shown in this figure, the light guide plate 474A corresponding to a region 463A at an upper left corner where a message to warn the lack of fuel is to be displayed is provided independently from the light guide plates 474 corresponding to other regions, and light shielding means 474B is provided between the light guide plates 474 and 474A.<br>
With the provision of the shielding means 474B, the portion corresponding to the boundary at the upper left corner of the example shown on the right side of FIG. 37 is displayed in the form of a thick strip shape.  This makes it possible to cover bleeding of colors of backlight between the adjacent regions, and hence to clearly distinguish the adjacent regions from each other.<br>
FIG. 28 is a block diagram showing an essential function of control of switching the color of backlight. In this figure, a state deciding unit 481 decides a state of a vehicle., that is, a vehicle speed or a residual amount of fuel on the basis of a display information signal. Display information (animated image data or character data, for example, numerical values expressing vehicle speeds) corresponding to state signals outputted<br><br>
                           86<br><br><br><br>
from the state deciding unit 481 are loaded in a display information loading unit 482. The liquid crystal driver 66 drives the liquid crystal portion 463 on the basis of display information.<br>
A state signal is also inputted in a backlight color storing unit 483.  The backlight color storing unit 483 has already stored backlight color data corresponding to state signals and outputs a piece of the backlight color data corresponding to the supplied state signal to the liquid crystal illuminating LED driver 467.  The liquid crystal illuminating LED driver 467 activates each LED element of the corresponding liquid crystal illuminating LED 464 on the basis of the piece of the backlight color data.  For example, if the liquid crystal illuminating LED 464 is composed of LED elements of red (R), green (G), and blue (B), there can be adopted a configuration that the piece of the backlight data is configured to have nine bits, and the colors of backlight emitted from the LED elements are mixed with each other by control of the bits, to illuminate the liquid crystal portion 463 with backlight of an arbitrary color.<br>
The backlight color storing unit 483 can store backlight color data corresponding to operation of the brake switches. A brake switch deciding unit 484 detects<br><br>
                             87<br><br>
an instruction to switch the color of backlight by turn-on/off of the brake switches, and outputs the detection signal to the backlight color data storing unit 483. The backlight color storing unit 483 outputs a piece of backlight color data corresponding to the detection signal.  In addition, the detection signal from the brake switch deciding unit 484 is outputted in precedence to the state signal, and thereby the piece of backlight color data based on the detection signal is outputted in precedence to the piece of the backlight color data based on the state signal.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention configured as described above exhibits the following effects.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, there is provided a meter system for a vehicle, which is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed during stoppage of the vehicle, characterized in that a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when<br>
88<br><br>
the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another. Specifically, since only running information is displayed during running of the vehicle, a driver can easily recognize the information, and the meter system for a vehicle becomes compact.<br>
Since a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, and the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another, a driver can enjoy looking at various kinds of display information and take deep interest not only on the vehicle but also on the meter system for a vehicle. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, the vehicle is an idle stop vehicle in which an engine is stopped at the time of stoppage of the vehicle, and the display information is switched to a display indicating idle stop on the basis of such information that the classified vehicle stoppage state is an idle stop state. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3,<br>
89<br><br>

According to then invention described in claim 7, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, or after the main switch is turned off, the display information is switched to a display indicating a summation of vehicle stoppage time. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 8, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state immediately after a main switch is turned on and before the vehicle runs, the display information is switched to a display of a running distance. As a result, it is possible to improve serviceability to a driver.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 9, the display of a running distance is a display of a character arbitrarily selected from a plurality of display patterns and a numerical value. As a result, it is possible to call a driver"s attention to a display of a running distance.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 10, when the classified vehicle stoppage state is a state in which a main switch is turned off, the display information is switched to maintenance information of the<br>
91<br><br>
vehicle, or a brand name and a mark of the vehicle. As a result, a driver can receive strong impression on a maintenance timing of the vehicle, and keep a good vehicle state.  Further, a brand identity can be enhanced by the display of a brand name and a mark.<br>
The meter system according to the invention described in claim 11 is operated to display a vehicle speed during running of the vehicle and to switch the display content from the vehicle speed to display information different from the vehicle speed, such as a display of the present time during stoppage of the vehicle, wherein a stoppage state of the vehicle is classified into vehicle stoppage states corresponding to vehicle states at the time of detection of vehicle stoppage, the display information is switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another. As a result, it is possible to make effective use of the meter system for a vehicle and hence to improve serviceability to a driver during stoppage of the vehicle.<br>
The meter system for a vehicle according to the invention described in claim 11 is configured such that input set-up of the display information is performed by a switch, and the switch is operated by brake levers of the<br>
92<br><br>
vehicle. As a result, it is possible to improve the operability of input set-up and hence to shorten a time required for input set-up of display information.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 12, the switch is turned on by turning on left and right brake levers and a main switch of the vehicle, to allow a mode of the input set-up to be displayed. As a result, the switch can serve as a switch for lighting a stop lamp so that it is possible to simplify the structure of the vehicle and to reduce the cost of the vehicle.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 13, the switch selects one term from the mode of the input set-up of the display information by operating the left brake lever, and determines the selected term by operating the right brake lever. As a result, it is possible to improve the operability of input set-up and hence to shorten a time required for input set-up.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 14, a display of the display information switched when the classified vehicle stoppage state is switched from one to another is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens, and a display of the vehicle speed is selectable from a plurality of previously prepared display screens. As a result, it is possible to<br><br>
                            93<br><br>
improve the usability of the meter system for a vehicle.<br>
Since the display information and the display of the vehicle speed are selected by operating the brake levers, it is possible to easily select the display screen.<br>
According to the inventions described in claims 15 to 18, although the monochrome liquid crystal display means is used, a visibility of each kind of display information on the monochrome liquid crystal display means can be improved by differentiating colors of backlight from each other.  In particular, according to the invention described in claim 16, in the case of simultaneously displaying a plurality of kinds of information, it is possible to further improve a visibility of the plurality of kinds of information by displaying the plurality of kinds of information in the order of precedence, for example, by emphasizing information having a high degree of precedence with backlight of a conspicuous color. According to the invention described in claim 17, since the backlight source is set to clearly correspond to each region on the liquid crystal portion it is possible to solve bleeding of colors between the adjacent regions and to distinguish<br><br>
