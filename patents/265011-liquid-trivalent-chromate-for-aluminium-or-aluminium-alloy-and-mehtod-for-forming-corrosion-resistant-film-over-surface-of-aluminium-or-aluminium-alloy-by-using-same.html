				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Liquid Trivalent Chromate for Aluminium or Aluminium Alloy And Method For Forming Corrosion-Resistant Film Over Surface Of Aluminium Or Aluminium Alloy By Using Same<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a trivalent chromate solution for an aluminium or aluminium alloy and a method for forming a corrosion resistant coating on the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy using it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An aluminium or aluminium alloy is often used in the field unsuitable for steel because it is light and easy to process and cast, as well as because of its property such as light, heat, electrical or vacuum property. In addition, the technological progress makes it to be easily joined, so it is utilized not only in the filed of building and transportation but also in the various fields such as automobile, electric car, airplane and consumer electronics. In recent years, furthermore, the amount of recycled aluminium is also large for various reasons such as environmental issue and being easy to recycle aluminium, then the demand is tending to increase.<br>
In these circumstances, for aluminium and aluminium alloy, a surface treatment such as hexavalent chromate treatment for the purpose of improvement in its corrosion resistance and the adhesion with paints is applied. However, said hexavalent chromate uses hexavalent chromium as main component, so hexavalent chromium is contained not only in the treatment solution but also in the hexavalent chromium coating. This hexavalent chromium is pointed out to have a bad influence upon human body and environment, so that the motion to restrain the use of hexavalent chromium has become brisk recently.<br>
Although the surface treatment method free from hexavalent chromium using trivalent chromium has been disclosed as one of the alternate techniques (for example, JP-A-6-173027, JP-A-7-126859, JP-A-11-152588 and JP-A-11-335865) (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"), such a method has not adequate corrosion resistance and adhesion with paints equivalent to those of hexavalent chromium and thus, under the present situation, said method is not industrialized.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for forming a coating on the surface of an aluminium<br>
or aluminium alloy using a trivalent chromate solution which does not contain any harmful hexavalent chromium, in which said coating has an excellent corrosion resistance and adhesion with paints.<br>
The present invention is based on the findings that the above-mentioned problems can efficiently be solved using a trivalent chromate solution containing a metal selected from the group consisting of zinc, cobalt, nickel and a combination thereof and a fluorine to form a trivalent chromate coating on the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy.<br>
The present invention, therefore, provides a hexavalent chromium free trivalent chromate solution for an aluminium or aluminium alloy, in which the concentration of the trivalent chromium is in the range of from 0.01 to 100 g/L, the concentration of the metal selected from the group consisting of zinc, cobalt, nickel and a combination thereof is in the range of from 0.01 to 100 g/L, the concentration of the fluorine is in the range of from 0.01 to 50 g/L.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a method for forming a corrosion resistant coating on the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy, comprising a step of contacting the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy<br>
with the trivalent chromate solution according to any one of claims 1 to 3.<br>
According to the present invention, a coating which has an excellent corrosion resistance and adhesion with paints can be formed on the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy. Therefore, it can be expected to be used widely and safely in various fields in future without using harmful hexavalent chromium which has been used until now.<br>

In dipping the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy in the above-mentioned trivalent chromate solution,<br>
for example, it is preferable that the solution temperature is from 10 to 80 °C and the dipping time is from 5 to 600 seconds, and it is more preferable that the solution temperature is from 20 to 60 °C and the dipping time is from 5 to 120 seconds. Moreover, the thickness of the formed trivalent chromate coating is preferably from 0.01 to 2 urn, more preferably form 0.02 to 0.5 urn.<br>
In addition, if necessary, the same treatments such as degreasing, etching and activating as those in the case of forming conventional hexavalent chromate coating can be performed as pretreatment for the surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy.<br>
Furthermore, for the purpose of improvement in corrosion resistance and appearance, coloring and the like, over-coat including paint or the like can be also applied after the formation of the trivalent chromate coating.<br>
[Examples]<br>
The surface of an aluminium or aluminium alloy was degreased, etched (see Examples) and activated, and then a trivalent chromate coating was formed thereon, as described below. Here, washing with water was carried out between each of steps and it was dried after the formation of the trivalent chromate coating.<br>
Degreasing was performed using AL-47 manufactured by DIPSOL CHEMICALS CO., LTD. (30 mL/L : dipped at 50 °C for 5 minutes).<br>
Etching was performed using #91 manufactured by DIPSOL CHEMICALS CO., LTD. (25 g/L : dipped at 50 °C for 30 seconds).<br>
Activating was performed using 62 % nitric acid (500 mL/L) or ALZ-740 manufactured by DIPSOL CHEMICALS CO., LTD. (150 g/L) + 62 % nitric acid (750 mL/L) (dipped at room temperature for 20 seconds).<br>
Drying was performed at 60 °C for 10 minutes.<br>
The method for evaluating corrosion resistance according to JIS Z2371 was used to carry out a 5 % salt­water spray test at 35 °C, and then the area of generated rust after 240 hours was evaluated in five ranks.<br>
In the evaluation of adhesion, a sample which had been<br>
allowed to stand for 24 hours after forming trivalent<br>
chromate coating and drying was dipped in a solvent type<br>
paint, baked and allowed to stand for another 24 hours. The<br>
resulting sample was then dipped in boiled purified<br>
