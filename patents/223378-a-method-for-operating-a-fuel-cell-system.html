				<td>A METHOD FOR OPERATING A FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fuel cells and, more particularly, to a method of<br>
operating a fuel cell system having closed fuel supply systems.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Electrochemical fuel cells convert fuel and oxidant to electricity. Solid polymer<br>
electrochemical fuel cells generally employ a membrane electrode assembly ("MEA")<br>
which comprises an ion exchange membrane or solid polymer electrolyte disposed<br>
between two electrodes typically comprising a layer of porous, electrically conductive<br>
sheet material, such as carbon fiber paper or carbon cloth. The MEA contains a layer of<br>
catalyst, typically in the form of finely comminuted platinum, at each<br>
membrane/electrode interface to induce the desired electrochemical reaction. In operation<br>
the electrodes are electrically coupled to provide a circuit for conducting electrons<br>
between the electrodes through an external circuit. Typically, a number of MEAs are<br>
serially coupled electrically to form a fuel cell stack having a desired power output.<br>
In typical fuel cells, the MEA is disposed between two electrically conductive<br>
fluid flow field plates or separator plates. Fluid flow field plates have at least one flow<br>
passage formed in at least one of the major planar surfaces thereof. The flow<br>
passages direct the fuel and oxidant to the respective electrodes, namely, the anode on the<br>
fuel side and the cathode on the oxidant side. The fluid flow field plates act as current<br>
collectors, provide support for the electrodes, provide access channels or passages for the<br>
fuel and oxidant to the respective anode and cathode surfaces, and provide passages for the<br>
removal of reaction products, such as water, formed during operation of the cell.<br>
Certain fuel cells are designed to operate in a closed mode on one or both<br>
reactants. Closed reactant supply systems include dead-ended configurations in which a<br>
reactant flow passage is generally closed, as well as systems employing closed-loop<br>
recirculation of the reactant exhaust stream from the fuel cell outlet to the fuel cell inlet and<br>
though the fuel cell with the addition of fresh reactant. In these situations the reactant used<br>
on the closed side is generally substantially pure. Typically a purge valve (which is<br>
normally closed in closed system operation) is provided somewhere in the reactant flow<br>
passage for periodic venting of accumulations of non-reactive components, which can build<br>
up in the reactant passages in closed system operation. In conventional fuel cell purge<br>
systems the purge valve is opened from time to time, for example, manually or at regular<br>
fixed time intervals. Alternatively a purge is triggered, for example, when the voltage or<br>
electrical output of one or more cells in a stack falls below a predetermined threshold value<br>
(see, for example, GB Patent No. 1 223 941), or when there is a predetermined decrease in<br>
electrical power output (see, for example, US Patent No. 3,553,026), or after the fuel cell<br>
has expended a preselected number of ampere-hours (see, for example, US Patent No.<br>
3,697,325). The reactant flow path through the fuel cell stack can be configured so that<br>
non-reactive components tend to accumulate first in just one or a few fuel cells of the stack,<br>
rather than in the outlet region of each cell in the stack. The purge system may be<br>
controlled via a controller (see, for example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2003/0022041).<br>
However, although purging can improve performance of fuel cells having closed<br>
reactant supply systems, it wastes valuable fuel and increases the parasitic load on the<br>
system since purging equipment is required. Furthermore, the release of hydrogen into the<br>
ambient environment may be undesirable. Accordingly, there remains a need for improved<br>
methods of operating fuel cells having closed reactant supply systems for which purging<br>
is not necessary.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present methods relate to fuel cells and, more particularly, to methods of<br>
operating fuel cells having closed fuel supply systems.<br>
In one embodiment, a method for operating a fuel cell system comprises at least<br>
one fuel cell stack, the stack comprising at least one fuel cell, the fuel cell system also<br>
comprising a reactant supply system, the reactant supply system comprising a fuel<br>
passage for directing a fuel stream through the stack and an oxidant passage for directing<br>
an oxidant stream through the stack, the method comprising : supplying the oxidant<br>
stream to the oxidant passage at an oxidant supply pressure: and supplying the fuel stream<br>
to the fuel passage at a fuel supply pressure; wherein the fuel supply pressure is at least 5<br>
psig greater than the oxidant supply pressure when a fuel side of the reactant supply<br>
system is closed.<br>
A person skilled in the art to which the present invention relates can select the<br>
oxidant supply pressure and fuel supply pressure depending on the oxidant and fuel<br>
supply used, taking care to see that the fuel supply pressure is at least 5 psig greater than<br>
the oxidant supply pressure when a fuel side of the reactant supply system is closed.<br>
In some embodiments, the fuel cell may be a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell,<br>
and the reactant streams hydrogen and air.<br>
In some embodiments, during operation the fuel supply pressure is always at least<br>
5 psig greater than the oxidant supply pressure, and may be between about 5 psig and 30<br>
psig greater than the oxidant supply pressure. In other embodiments, the fuel supply<br>
pressure may be intermittently at least 5 psig greater than the oxidant supply pressure.<br>
In some embodiments, the fuel supply pressure may be varied, and the variation<br>
may be at a substantially constant frequency, or based on the power output fuel cell<br>
system, or based on a parameter indicative of fuel cell performance. In other<br>
embodiments, the fuel supply pressure may be varied during different operational phases,<br>
such as during shut-down and/or start-up of the fuel cell system.<br>
In some embodiments, the fuel side of the reactant supply system is always closed,<br>
such as by having a fuel side of at least one fuel cell dead-ended. In other embodiments,<br>
the fuel side of the reactant supply system comprises a recirculation loop for recirculating<br>
the fuel stream through the stack. In still other embodiments, the fuel side of the reactant<br>
supply system comprises a purge valve which may be periodically opened to discharge a<br>
portion of the fuel stream from the stack. In still other embodiments, the fuel side of the<br>
reactant supply system may be closed at a plurality of locations, such as having the fuel<br>
side of each fuel cell dead-ended. In still further embodiments, the fuel cell system<br>
comprises a primary stack and a secondary stack fluidly connected to receive the fuel<br>
stream in series downstream of the primary stack, wherein a fuel passage of the secondary<br>
stack is dead-ended at least some of the time.<br>
These and other aspects of the present methods will be apparent upon reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings and following detailed description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following detailed description, certain specific details are set forth in<br>
order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention.<br>
However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without<br>
these details. In other instances, well known structures associated with fuel cell stacks and<br>
fuel cell systems have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the<br>
descriptions of the embodiments of the invention.<br>
Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and<br>
claims which follow, the word "comprise" and variations thereof, such as "comprises" and<br>
"comprising" are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, that is as "including but not<br>
limited to".<br>
Figure 1 shows a portion of a fuel cell system 10, namely, a fuel cell stack<br>
12 and an electronic fuel cell control system 14. Fuel cell stack 12 includes; a number of<br>
fuel cell assemblies 16 arranged between a pair of end plates 18a, 18b, one of the fuel cell<br>
assemblies 16 being partially removed from fuel cell stack 12 to better illustrate the<br>
structure of fuel cell assembly 16. Tie rods (not shown) extend between end plates 18a,<br>
18b and cooperate with fastening nuts 17 to bias end plates 18a, 18b together by applying<br>
pressure to the various components to ensure good contact therebetween.<br>
Each fuel cell assembfy 16 includes a membrane electrode assembly 20<br>
including two electrodes, the anode 22 and the cathode 24, separated by an ion exchange<br>
membrane 26. Electrodes 22, 24 can be formed from a porous, electrically conductive<br>
sheet material, such as carbon fiber paper or cloth, that is permeable to the reactants. Each<br>
of electrodes 22, 24 is coated on a surface adjacent to ion exchange membrane 26 with a<br>
catalyst 27, such as a thin layer of platinum, to render each electrode electrochemically<br>
active.<br>
Fuel cell assembly 16 also includes a pair of separators or flow field plates<br>
28 sandwiching membrane electrode assembly 20. In the illustrated embodiment, each of<br>
flow field plates 28 includes one or more reactant passages 30 formed on a planar surface<br>
of flow field plate 28 adjacent an associated one of electrodes 22, 24 for carrying fuel to<br>
anode 22 and oxidant to cathode 24, respectively. (Reactant passage 30 on only one of<br>
flow field plates 28 is visible in Figure 1.) Reactant passages 30 that carry the oxidant also<br>
carry exhaust air and product water away from cathode 24. As will be described in more<br>
detail below, fuel stack 12 is designed to operate in a closed fuel supply mode, thus<br>
substantially all of the hydrogen fuel supplied to it during operation is consumed, and little<br>
if any hydrogen is carried away from the stack 12 in normal operation of system 10.<br>
Each flow field plate 28 may include a plurality of cooling channels 32<br>
formed on the planar surface of the flow field plate 28 opposite the planar surface having<br>
reactant passage 30. When the stack is assembled, the cooling channels 32 of each adjacent<br>
fuel cell assembly 16 cooperate so that closed cooling channels 32 are formed between<br>
each membrane electrode assembly 20. Cooling channels 32 transmit a coolant fluid<br>
through fuel cell stack 12. Cooling channels 32 may be straight and parallel to each other,<br>
and traverse each plate 28 so that cooling channel inlets and outlets are located at<br>
respective edges of plate 28.<br>
While the illustrated fuel cell system includes two flow field plates 28 in<br>
each fuel cell assembly 16, the system may alternatively include a single bipolar flow field<br>
plate (not shown) between adjacent membrane electrode assemblies 20. In such systems, a<br>
channel on one side of the bipolar plate carries fuel to the anode of one adjacent membrane<br>
electrode assembly 20, while a channel on the other side of the plate carries oxidant to the<br>
cathode of another adjacent membrane electrode assembly 20. In such systems, additional<br>
flow field plates 28 having channels for carrying coolant (e.g., liquid or gas, such as,<br>
cooling air) can be spaced throughout fuel cell stacks 12, as needed to provide sufficient<br>
cooling of stack 12.<br>
End plate 18a includes a fuel stream inlet port (not shown) for introducing a<br>
supply fuel stream into fuel cell stack 12. End plate 18b includes a fuel stream outlet port<br>
35 for discharging an exhaust fuel stream from fuel cell stack 12 that comprises primarily<br>
water and non-reactive components and impurities. Fuel stream outlet port 35 is normally<br>
closed with a valve in closed fuel supply system operation.<br>
Each fuel cell assembly 16 has openings formed therein to cooperate with<br>
corresponding openings in adjacent assemblies 16 to form internal fuel supply and exhaust<br>
manifolds (not shown) that extend the length of stack 12. The fuel stream inlet port is<br>
fluidly connected to fluid outlet port 35 via respective reactant passages 30 that are in fluid<br>
communication with the fuel supply and exhaust manifolds, respectively.<br>
End plate 18b includes an oxidant stream inlet port 37 for introducing<br>
supply air (oxidant stream) into fuel cell stack 12, and an oxidant stream outlet port 39 for<br>
discharging exhaust air from fuel cell stack 12. Each fuel cell assembly 16 has openings<br>
31, 34, formed therein to cooperate with corresponding openings in adjacent fuel cell<br>
assemblies 16 to form oxidant supply and exhaust manifolds that extend the length of stack<br>
12. Oxidant inlet port 37 is fluidly connected to the oxidant outlet port 39 via respective<br>
reactant passages 30 that are in fluid communication with oxidant supply and. exhaust<br>
manifolds, respectively.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, fuel may be directed through fuel cell stack 12 in a<br>
cascaded flow pattern. A first set 11 of fuel cell assemblies 16 are arranged so that fuel<br>
flows within the set in a concurrent parallel direction (represented by arrows 13) that is<br>
generally opposite the direction of the flow of coolant through fuel cell stack 12. Fuel flow<br>
through a next set 15 of two fuel cell assemblies 16 is in series with respect to the flow of<br>
fuel in the first set 11, and in a concurrent parallel direction within the set 15 (in a direction<br>
represented by arrows 17) that is generally concurrent with the direction of the flow of<br>
coolaat through fuel cell stack 12. Fuel flow through a final set 19 of two fuel cells<br>
assemblies 16 is in series with respect to the first and second sets 11,15, and in a<br>
concurrent parallel direction within the set 19 (in a direction represented by arrow 21),<br>
generally opposite the flow of coolant through fuel cell stack 12. The oxidant is supplied<br>
to each of the fuel cells in parallel, in the same general direction as the flow of coolant<br>
through fuel cell stack 12.<br>
In an alternate configuration, rather than "dead-ending" fuel cell stack 12,<br>
the s)'stem may comprise a second fuel cell stack which is dead-ended and which is<br>
downstream (with respect to the direction of reactant flow), and is fluidly connected to, fuel<br>
cell stack 12. In yet another alternate configuration, rather than dead-ending fuel cell stack<br>
12 at one location (e.g., by closing fuel outlet port 35) as shown in Figure 1, fuel cell stack<br>
12 may be dead-ended at a number of locations along reactant passages 30. For example,<br>
some or all of the individual fuel cell assemblies 16 may be dead-ended or fuel cell stack<br>
12 may be divided into a number of sections, each of which is supplied with fuel and is<br>
dead-ended separately.<br>
Each membrane electrode assembly 20 is designed to produce a nominal<br>
potential difference between anode 22 and cathode 24. Reactants (hydrogen and air) are<br>
supplied to electrodes 22, 24 on either side of ion exchange membrane 26 through reactant<br>
passages 30. Hydrogen is supplied to anode 22, where platinum catalyst 27 promotes its<br>
separation into protons and electrons, which pass as useful electricity through an external<br>
circuit (not shown). On the opposite side of membrane electrode assembly 20, air flows<br>
through reactant passages 30 to cathode 24 where oxygen in the air reacts with protons<br>
passing through the ion exchange membrane 26 to produce product water.<br>
With continuing reference to Figure 1, electronic control system 14<br>
comprises various electrical and electronic components on a circuit board 38 and various<br>
sensors 44 and actuators 46 distributed throughout fuel cell system 10. Circuit board 38<br>
carries a microprocessor or microcontroller 40 that is appropriately programmed or<br>
configured to carry out fuel cell system operation. Microcontroller 40 can take the form of<br>
an Atmel AVR RISC microcontroller available from Atmel Corporation of San Jose,<br>
California. Electronic control system 14 also includes a persistent memory 42, such as an<br>
EEPROM portion of microcontroller 40 or as a discrete nonvolatile controller-readable<br>
media.<br>
Microcontroller 40 is coupled to receive input from sensors 44 and to provide output to actuators 46.<br>
The input and / or output can take the form of either digital and / or analog signals. A rechargeable battery 47<br>
powers the electronic control system 14 until fuel cell stack 12 can provide sufficient power to the electronic<br>
control system 14. Microcontroller 40 is selectively couplable between fuel cell stack 12 and battery 47 for<br>
switching power during fuel cell system operation and / or to recharge battery 47 during fuel cell operation.<br>
Without being bound by theory, the conditions existing in fuel cell assembly 16 operating on air and<br>
having a closed fuel supply are described. Assuming steady state conditions, there is no net diffusion of<br>
nitrogen across membrane 26. Near the inlet of anode 22 the mol fraction of nitrogen in the fuel stream is low<br>
as a relatively small amount of nitrogen diffuses across membrane 26 and enters the fuel passages. As fuel is<br>
consumed along the length of anode 22 the mol fraction of nitrogen increases. Due to convective mass flow<br>
of nitrogen and the consumption of fuel in fuel cell assembly 16, the mol fraction of nitrogen near the outlet<br>
of anode 22 may be greater than the mol fraction of nitrogen in cathode 24, in which case nitrogen will back-<br>
diffuse across membrane 26 to the cathode side. At steady state the integral of the nitrogen concentration<br>
gradient across the membrane times the cell area over the inlet of the cell (driving diffusion from cathode to<br>
anode) equals the integral of the corresponding nitrogen concentration gradient times the cell area over the<br>
outlet of the cell (driving diffusion from anode to cathode).<br>
In a dead-ended system without anode exhaust recycling, the mol fraction of nitrogen near<br>
the outlet of anode 22 will exceed the mol fraction of nitrogen in air. Thus, a. nitrogen concentration<br>
gradient will exist in anode 22. The magnitude of the concentration gradient is affected by factors<br>
including the fuel velocity in the anode flow field and the fuel stoichiometry. Increasing the fuel<br>
velocity in anode 22 will increase the convective mass flow of nitrogen toward i:he outlet of anode 22,<br>
increasing the concentration gradient. Fuel velocity increases with factors such as the pressure drop<br>
associated with anode 22, increased operating pressure of fuel cell assembly 16 and high loads.<br>
Decreasing the fuel stoichiometry also increases the nitrogen concentration gradient. Indeed, at a fuel<br>
stoichiometry of I, essentially all of the fuel in anode 22 is consumed and the mol faction<br>
of nitrogen near the outlet of anode 22 approaches unit}'.<br>
If the anode exhaust is recycled periodically, or a portion of the exhaust is<br>
recycled, then the nitrogen concentration gradient will be lessened, but the nitrogen<br>
concentration near the outlet of anode 22 may still be greater than the cathode nitrogen<br>
concentration. With continuous recycle of the anode exhaust, the concentration gradient<br>
may be substantially eliminated, but the nitrogen concentration in the anode flow field will<br>
equal the nitrogen concentration in the cathode flow field.<br>
Diffused nitrogen impedes the reaction at anode 22 (due to dilution of the<br>
fuel) and ultimately may cause the performance of the fuel cell assembly 16 to drop to an<br>
unacceptable level.<br>
By maintaining the fuel supply pressure at a sufficiently high level<br>
according to the present methods, the mol fraction of the nitrogen is well below the mol<br>
fraction of the fuel, and there is sufficient fuel (e.g., hydrogen) to sustain the anode<br>
reaction. According to the present methods, during at least some periods of operation the<br>
fuel is supplied at an overpressure (i.e. the fuel overpressure is equal to the difference<br>
between the fuel supply pressure and the oxidant supply pressure to the fuel cell assembly)<br>
of at least 5 psig. Overpressures greater than 5 psig may also be of further benefit and may<br>
improve the performance and reliability of fuel cell system 10 for reasons in addition to<br>
overcoming nitrogen diffusion across membrane 26. For example, increased fuel supply<br>
pressures are known to improve catalyst activity. The magnitude of the fuel overpressure<br>
to be used according to the present methods may be limited by the components and<br>
configuration of fuel cell system 10, particularly the tolerance of the seals and membrane<br>
26 to increased fuel overpressure.<br>
Temperature and other operating conditions may be optimized for particular<br>
stack configurations. For example, by employing the present methods, it may be possible<br>
to operate fuel cell system 10 at higher operating temperatures than would be practical if<br>
fuel cell system 10 was to be operated without the present methods. Increased operating<br>
temperatures may improve the performance of fuel cell systems having a closed fuel supply<br>
system by improving water management at the anode.<br>
While the foregoing discussion has been related to the diffusion of nitrogen<br>
into the anode space of fuel cells, it is understood that the same principles apply in respect<br>
of other inert or non-reactive components present in the oxidant stream that diffuse across<br>
the fuel cell membrane.<br>
In one embodiment of the present methods, fuel is continuously supplied to<br>
stack 12 at an overpressure of greater than 5 psig. In other embodiments, the fuel supply<br>
pressure may be varied, so that fuel is sometimes supplied at an overpressure of greater<br>
than 5 psig, while at other times the fuel is not supplied at an overpressure of greater than 5<br>
psig. In still other embodiments, the fuel overpressure may be varied between a 5 psig<br>
overpressure and a greater overpressure. The variations may be of a constant frequency or<br>
intermittent (variable frequency), and may be either independent of or dependent on the<br>
transient operating conditions of fuel cell system 10. For example, the overpressure may<br>
be varied at predetermined intervals from the start of operation. In another embodiment,<br>
the use or the magnitude of fuel overpressure may be controlled by microcontroller 40<br>
depending on the input received by sensors 44. In one embodiment, sensors 44 monitor<br>
one or more parameters indicative of stack or cell performance, such as the voltage of one<br>
or more cells, to e.g. detect when fuel starvation is occurring. Similarly, the use of or<br>
magnitude of overpressure may also be different during various operating phases of fuel<br>
cell system 10, such as during start-up or shut-down of fuel cell system 10. Similarly, the<br>
use of or magnitude of overpressure may be varied depending on the load on or power<br>
output of fuel cell system 10, such as during no-load or partial load conditions. For<br>
example, the overpressure may be lesser during no-load or partial load conditions than<br>
during full-load conditions. In addition, the rate of change of the load conditions may<br>
affect the desired overpressure, e.g. during transient conditions.<br>
As discussed above, due to the flow of fuel through the fuel passages as the<br>
fuel is consumed, the non-reactive components tend to accumulate near the; location(s)<br>
where fuel cell stack 12 is dead-ended. This may lead to unacceptable performance of the<br>
fuel cell assemblies 16 in the location. Accordingly, in further alternate embodiments,<br>
system configurations described above, such as systems which comprise a second fuel cell<br>
stack which is dead-ended or systems in which fuel cell stack 12 is dead-ended at a number<br>
of locations along the fuel flow path, may be employed to mitigate such effects. For<br>
 example, in a system comprising a second fuel cell stack, which is dead-ended and which is<br>
fluidly connected downstream (with respect to the direction of reactant flew) to the primary<br>
fuel cell stack, the non-reactive components will tend to accumulate in the second "dead-<br>
ended" fuel cell stack. In this way, the performance of the primary fuel cell stack will be<br>
preserved.<br>
 As described above, according to the present methods, fuel cell system 10<br>
may be operated without the need for intermittent purges by maintaining the fuel supply<br>
pressure at a level sufficiently greater than the oxidant pressure. Thus, a purging system is<br>
not a required component of fuel cell system 10. However, it may be desirable for fuel cell<br>
system 10 to retain the ability to purge, and accordingly, in alternate embodiments, fuel cell<br>
system 10 may include purging equipment. For example, the final set 19 of fuel cell<br>
assemblies 16 in Figure 2 may comprise a purge cell portion of the fuel cell stack in which<br>
non-reactive components, including nitrogen, may be vented by opening a purge valve.<br>
(Although fuel cell stack 12 is designed to consume substantially all of the hydrogen fuel<br>
supplied to it during operation, traces of unreacted hydrogen may also be discharged<br>
through the fuel stream outlet port 35 (Figure 1) during a purge of fuel cell stack 12.)<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present methods, purging may be<br>
used in conjunction with fuel overpressure. For example, the purging system may be<br>
activated periodically, or as necessary, depending on system performance. See, for<br>
example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0022041,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In yet another embodiment of the<br>
present methods, overpressure may be used in conjunction with a continuous small bleed of<br>
the fuel stream from the anode side of fuel cell stack 12. See, for example, U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/253,390, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The bleed location(s) can be selected such that they are in the vicinity of where nitrogen is<br>
most likely to accumulate, such as where the stack and/or individual cell(s) are dead-ended,<br>
as discussed above.<br>
The following examples have been included to illustrate different<br>
embodiments and aspects of the present methods but they should not be construed as<br>
limiting in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The cell voltage of the individual cells of a Ballard fuel cell stack (10 cells)<br>
was monitored. The stack was closed on the fuel side, and was operated at a coolant inlet<br>
temperature of about 70°C, with the fuel cell stack producing about 150 mA/cm2. Air was<br>
supplied to the stack as the oxidant at a constant pressure of apppxiimately 10 psig, a<br>
stoichiometry of approximately l.S and a relative humidity of approximately 73%.<br>
(Stoichiometry is the ratio of fuel or oxidant supplied to that consumed in the generation of<br>
electrical power in the fuel cell.) Substantially pure hydrogen was supplied to the stack at a<br>
stoichiometry of about 1.0 and a relative humidity of approximately 67%. The pressure of<br>
the hydrogen supplied was varied from about 10 psig (fuel overpressure ~ 0 psig) to about<br>
40 psig (fuel overpressure ~ 30 psig). The stack was not purged during the test period.<br>
Figure 3 shows the voltage of the individual cells over time as the fuel<br>
overpressure was varied. As shown in Figure 3, the stack operated continuously, without<br>
the need for fuel purges, for approximately 2 hours so long as the fuel pressure was at least<br>
5 psig greater than the oxidant pressure (time = 0 to time =120 minutes). As can be seen<br>
from Figure 3, although the voltage of half of the cells was lower than the others during<br>
that period, the performance of the lower voltage cells was nonetheless stable. However,<br>
once the fuel overpressure was reduced below about 5 psig, the performance of some of the<br>
cells started to drop significantly.<br>
Figure 4 is an extract from the Figure 3 data, showing the voltage of the<br>
individual cells and the stack at the various fuel overpressures. Again, as can be seen from<br>
the figure, the cells were able to operate without any stack purging when the fuel<br>
overpressure was greater than about 5 psig. Their performance began to drop significantly<br>
once the fuel overpressure was reduced below 5 psig.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The cell voltage of a 47 fuel cell NEXA™ stack was monitored. The stack<br>
was closed on the fuel side, and was operated at a coolant inlet temperature of about 65°C,<br>
v/ith the fuel cell stack producing about 432 mA/cm2. Air was supplied to the stack as the<br>
oxidant at a constant pressure of approximately 2.25 psig, a stoichiometry of approximately<br>
2.0 and a relative humidity of approximately 90-95%. Substantially pure unhumidified<br>
hydrogen was supplied to the stack at a pressure of approximately 14.25 psig and a<br>
stoichiometry of about 1.0 (fuel overpressure ~ 12 psig). After approximately 64 hours, the<br>
coolant inlet temperature was increased to about 75°C and the stack was operated for<br>
approximately 2 additional hours, after which the test was stopped. The stack was not<br>
purged during the test period.<br>
Figure 5 shows the average cell voltage over time during the above test<br>
period (i.e. closed fuel side operation with substantially constant fuel overpressure). As<br>
shown in Figure 5, the stack operated continuously, without the need for fuel purges, for<br>
over 63 hours al a coolant inlet temperature of 65°C, and an additional 2 hours at a coolant<br>
inlet temperature of 75°C. As can be seen from Figure 5, increasing the coolant inlet<br>
temperature improved the average cell voltage.<br>
It can be advantageous to use the above described methods, involving use of<br>
a fuel overpressure, in fuel cell systems that are dead-ended on the fuel side but have a fuel<br>
recirculation loop. In such configurations the accumulation of nitrogen and non-reactive<br>
components on the anode side (in the fuel loop) can be mitigated by use of a fuel<br>
overpressure.<br>
The various embodiments described above and in the applications and<br>
patents incorporated herein by reference can be combined to provide further embodiments.<br>
The described methods can omit some acts and can add other acts, and can execute the acts<br>
in a different order than that illustrated, to achieve the advantages of the invention.<br>
These and other changes can be made to the invention in light of the above<br>
detailed description. In general, in the following claims, the terms used should not be<br>
construed to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification,<br>
but should be construed to include all fuel cell systems, controllers and processors,<br>
actuators, and sensors that operate in accordance with the claims. Accordingly, the<br>
