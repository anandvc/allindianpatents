				<td>WATER TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, methods and kits for use in the purification<br>
of contaminated drinking water for purposes of rendering it potable. The compositions<br>
and kits are especially designed for personal or domestic use in the batchwise purification<br>
and clarification of relatively small predetermined volumes of contaminated drinking<br>
water. The compositions and kits are also designed for personal or domestic use in the<br>
purification and nullification of contaminated drinking water<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
There is a need for potable water in all areas of the world. In developed countries, water is<br>
purified and potable water is supplied on a large scale, typically by large national or<br>
multinational water management companies. This water is typically supplied directly to<br>
the consumers homes in a potable form. However, in some parts of the world, for example<br>
in some rural areas of developing countries, many people either do not have a direct water<br>
supply to their homes and only have access to a non-potable communal water supply such<br>
as a village well, or cannot be guaranteed that the water they do receive is potable. As a<br>
result, considerable numbers of people die each year as the direct result of drinking<br>
contaminated drinking water. Thus, there is a need for water purification kits and<br>
compositions that allow the consumer to purify their own water, which produces potable<br>
water in a fast and efficient manner.<br>
Current water purification compositions available on the market to date, consist mainly of<br>
disinfectants, e.g. sources of chlorine and/or iodine, and do not adequately purify water.<br>
Water which is obtained after treatment by these water purification kits, may still<br>
comprise amounts of water impurities, e.g. heavy metal ions such as arsenic, which, when<br>
continually consumed for a prolonged period of time, may lead to health problems. Thus,<br>
there is a need to provide a water purification composition which removes water-<br>
impurities like heavy metal ions including arsenic and lead, more efficiently and<br>
effectively than current water purification kits.<br>
It has now been found that water purification compositions based on certain combinations<br>
of inorganic coagulants and water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers remove greater<br>
amounts of water impurities, such as heavy metals, from water compared to current water<br>
purification compositions.<br>
Also, current water purification compositions do not adequately remove, kill or inactive<br>
micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and cysts, which are present in the water. Thus,<br>
there remains a need to provide a water purification composition which does adequately<br>
remove, kill or inactive these micro-organisms.<br>
It has now been found that when the composition of the present invention comprises a<br>
disinfecting agent, the composition removes, kills or inactivates a surprisingly larger<br>
amount of micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and cysts compared to water<br>
purification compositions known in the art.<br>
In addition, the water which is to be purified by a water purification composition typically<br>
comprises a large amount of water-soluble organic content such as humic acid. With<br>
current water purification compositions, bleach, especially chlorine based bleach, can<br>
react with the water-soluble organic content and produce by-products in the water,<br>
including chlorine derivatives such as chloroacetic acid or chloroform, which are harmful<br>
to human and animal health. Thus, mere is a need to provide water purification<br>
compositions, methods and kits which produce purified water comprising a low amount<br>
of disinfection by-products.<br>
Another problem associated with die use of certain chlorine-based disinfectants such as<br>
calcium hypochlorite is that of product stability. In particular, it has been found that<br>
known compositions based on calcium hypochlorite can lose substantial disinfection<br>
efficacy under regular conditions of storage and use. Thus, there is a need for purification<br>
and disinfection compositions having improved storage stability.<br>
After purification and disinfection of contaminated drinking water, there raises the further<br>
problem of maintaining the purity and aesthetic quality of the water until such time as it is<br>
required for drinking, whilst at the same time providing drinking water of satisfactory<br>
taste. In this context, it has been found that the use of chlorine-based disinfectants and<br>
coagulants for treating drinking water containing high levels of soluble manganese<br>
contamination, introduced either from the water or from the coagulant itself, can lead to<br>
the onset of a water discoloration effect subsequent to the flocculation step. Such a<br>
discolouration effect is referred to herein as 'manganese-associated post-flocculation<br>
discoloration' of the drinking water. Although the reasons for this effect are not fully<br>
understood, it is believed that residual soluble manganese remaining after the coagulation<br>
and flocculation reaction has taken place is prone to oxidation by chlorine-based<br>
disinfectant with the formation of highly colored pure or mixed colloidal species that<br>
contain some manganese dioxide. Thus there is a need for compositions, methods and<br>
kits for purifying contaminated drinking water and which provides purified water having<br>
improved aesthetics as well as longer life and improved taste attributes.<br>
In addition to the need for purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water, there is<br>
also a huge need in many parts of the world to improve standards of nutrition and health.<br>
The effective provision of both clean water and essential minerals and vitamins would<br>
clearly be of universal benefit but especially so in those parts of the world where potable<br>
water is in short supply. Thus there is a need for compositions, methods and kits for<br>
purifying and at the same time minifying contaminated drinking water.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, methods and kits for purifying and/or<br>
clarifying contaminated drinking water, as well as to compositions, methods and kits for<br>
purifying and nutrifying contaminated drinking water. In general terms, the compositions<br>
herein comprise at least a primary coagulant material, a microbiocidal disinfectant, and an<br>
oxidant system for preventing or reducing manganese-associated post-flocculation<br>
discoloration. Highly preferred compositions also contain one or more of a so-called<br>
bridging flocculent material, the levels and ratios of coagulant to flocculent preferably<br>
falling within certain ranges, a coagulant aid, a water-soluble alkali, a water-insoluble<br>
silicate (for example a clay, zeolite or mixture thereof), and a food additive or nutrient<br>
source.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for purifying<br>
and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises a primary coagulant, a<br>
microbiocidal chlorine-based disinfectant, an oxidant system capable of providing<br>
catalytic or autocatalytic oxidation of soluble Mn(II) to MnO2, and optionally one or more<br>
of a bridging flocculant, a coagulant aid, a water-soluble alkali, a water-insoluble silicate<br>
selected from clays, zeolites and mixtures thereof; and a food additive or nutrient source.<br>
Of these the bridging flocculent and coagulant aid are especially valuable in conjunction<br>
with the primary coagulant and oxidant system for minimising manganese-associated<br>
post-flocculation discoloration. Although the reasons for this are not fully understood, it<br>
is believed that the systems of the invention are particularly effective in oxidising Mn(II)<br>
and in coagulating and flocculating the resulting colloidal manganese dioxide, thereby<br>
minimising or preventing the post-flocculation discoloration effect.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the primary coagulant is selected from the group consisting of<br>
water-soluble, multivalent inorganic salts and mixtures thereof, for example, iron<br>
sulphate, iron chloride, aluminium chloride, aluminium sulphate, manganese sulphate,<br>
manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, poly- variations thereof, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Generally, the compositions herein comprise from about 10% to about<br>
99%, preferably from about 15% to about 50%, more preferably from about 25% to about<br>
40% by weight of the primary coagulant.<br>
The bridging flocculant on the other hand is preferably a high molecular weight water-<br>
soluble or water-dispersible polymer or mixture of polymers having a weight average<br>
molecular weight of at least about 2,000,000, more preferably at least about 5,000,000<br>
and especially at least about 15,000,000. Bridging flocculents preferred for use herein are<br>
selected from the group consisting of water-soluble and water-dispersible anionic and<br>
nonionic polymers and mixtures thereof. Generally, the compositions herein comprise<br>
from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 5%, more preferably<br>
from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of the bridging flocculent<br>
The term 'coagulant aid' herein refers to a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer of<br>
lower molecular weight than that of the bridging flocculant and which aids the overall<br>
aggregation and flocculation process. The coagulant aid preferred for use herein is a low<br>
molecular weight, water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer which generally has a<br>
weight average molecular weight of less than about 1,500,000, preferably less than about<br>
750,000 and especially less than about 300,000 and mixtures thereof. Generally the<br>
compositions herein comprise from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.5%<br>
to about 5%, more preferably from about 1% to about 4% by weight of the coagulant aid.<br>
Although suitable coagulant aids include anionic polymeric hydrophilic colloids such as<br>
the carboxymethylcelluloses, highly preferred from the viewpoint of delivering excellent<br>
heavy metal, total soluble organic and cyst reduction performance are coagulant aids<br>
selected from the group consisting of water-soluble and water-dispersible cationic<br>
polymers and mixtures thereof, for example cationic polysaccharides of which chitosan is<br>
especially preferred. Preferred coagulant aids herein are substantially water-insoluble,<br>
having at least 10% by dry total weight of undissolved material as determined by the test<br>
described herein below, this being preferred from the viewpoint of providing<br>
compositions and methods delivering low total water-soluble organic content.<br>
The weight ratio of primary coagulant to bridging flocculant herein is preferably from<br>
about 10:1 to about 200:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 150:1, yet more<br>
preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1, and especially from about 25:1 to about 75:1,<br>
these ratios being valuable especially in conjunction with the levels of coagulant and<br>
flocculant described herein above for providing optimum purification performance in<br>
highly contaminated water conditions and for providing significantly improved rates of<br>
filtration and 'non-blocking' filter characteristics as well as excellent final product purity<br>
and clarity using paper and non-woven filters. Although the reasons for this improvement<br>
in filtration rate, non-blocking characteristics and product clarity are not fully understood,<br>
it is believed that higher levels and ratios of the bridging flocculant relative to the<br>
coagulant increases the 'stickiness' of the floes with a consequent reduction in colloidal<br>
participates. Such compositions are also highly suitable for use herein in conjunction<br>
with cloth filters.<br>
Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises a primary<br>
coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble, multivalent inorganic salts<br>
and mixtures thereof; a microbiocidal chlorine-based disinfectant in a level sufficient to<br>
cause manganese-associated post-flocculation discoloration of the drinking water; an<br>
oxidant system providing catalytic or autocatalytic oxidation of soluble Mn(II) to MnO2; a<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant wherein the weight ratio<br>
of primary coagulant to bridging flocculant is from about 10:1 to about 150:1, preferably<br>
from about 20:1 to about 100:1, and more preferably from about 25:1 to about 75:1; and<br>
optionally a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric coagulant aid. The filtration<br>
characteristics of the composition can be assessed using a standard filtration test and are<br>
preferably such that at least one litre of treated model surface water after treatment with<br>
620mg/litre of purification composition passes a Whatman 1.2µm GF/C grade filter in<br>
less than 1 hour, preferably less than 45 minutes, and more preferably less than 30<br>
minutes under ambient temperature conditions (20°C) and that at least 1 litre, preferably<br>
at least 2 litres, more preferably at least 3 litres of the treated water will pass the filter<br>
without blocking.<br>
The model surface water described comprises:<br>
(i) 24mg/1 humic acid - source of soluble natural organic matter,<br>
(ii) 20mg/1 fine test dust(l-3 um)- designed to add turbidity,<br>
(iii) 1 S00mg/1 salt - to give stress conditions of high total dissolved solids.<br>
The resultant water has a high organic content (&gt;10mg/l total organic content (TOC)),<br>
high colour (&gt;300 platinum cobalt units (PCU)), high turbidity (&gt;15 nephelometric<br>
turbidity units (NTU)) and high total dissolved solids (TDS). The pH of the water is near<br>
neutral but can also be adjusted to pH 5 or 9 using HC1 or NaOH respectively for stress<br>
testing. This water is referred to herein as 'model surface water'.<br>
Compositions having optimum purification and clarification performance can also be<br>
defined by reference to the weight ratio of the primary coagulant and coagulant aid to the<br>
bridging flocculant. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of primary<br>
coagulant to coagulant aid is from about 8:1 to about 100:1, preferably from about 12:1 to<br>
about 30:1, and more preferably from about 15:1 to about 25:1. The weight ratio of<br>
coagulant aid to bridging flocculant, on the other hand, is preferably in the range from<br>
about 10:1 to about 1:6, preferably from about 5:1 to about 1:3, more preferably from<br>
about 3:1 to about 1:1.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention also comprise a microbiocidal<br>
disinfectant. Although a broad range of microbiocidal disinfectants are envisaged for use<br>
herein, preferred is a chlorine-based disinfectant. Calcium hypochlorite is especially<br>
preferred. Preferably, the compositions herein comprise primary coagulant and<br>
microbiocidal disinfectant in a weight ratio of from about 10:1 to about 100:1, more<br>
preferably from about 12:1 to about 60:1, and especially from about 15:1 to about 40:1.<br>
Generally, the compositions herein comprise from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably<br>
from about 0.5% to about 4%, more preferably from about 0.7% to about 2.5% by weight<br>
of the microbiocidal disinfectant.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention also comprise an oxidant system.<br>
The function of the oxidant system is to oxidise the soluble manganese (Mn(H)) content<br>
of the drinking water and coagulant to colloidal manganese dioxide to the fullest possible<br>
extent within the natural timeframe of the coagulation/flocculation reaction.. Given that<br>
the coagulation/flocculation systems of the compositions of the invention are highly<br>
active, typically giving at least 80% reduction in the organic matter content of the<br>
drinking water within 30 seconds and essentially complete flocculation within 5 minutes,<br>
this imposes considerable demands on the oxidant system.<br>
Preferred from the viewpoint of providing rapid and effective oxidation of soluble<br>
manganese and optimum control of manganese-associated post-flocculation discoloration<br>
are oxidant systems selected from the group consisting of autocatalytic oxidants,<br>
combinations of oxidants and oxidation catalysts, and mixtures thereof. The oxidants<br>
utilized herein should have an oxidation-reduction potential in excess of the MnO2/Mn(II)<br>
system under the conditions of use and preferably having a standard oxidation-reduction<br>
potential of at least about 1.23 V. When incorporated in the compositions of the<br>
invention, an amount of the oxidant system sufficient to provide 200 ppb of autocatalytic<br>
oxidant or oxidation catalyst should be capable of reducing the soluble manganese<br>
concentration of deionised water containing ISO ppb of soluble manganese by at least<br>
about 50%, preferably at least about 60% in one minute and by at least about 60%,<br>
preferably at least about 70% in five minutes, soluble manganese concentration being<br>
measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and the test being run at ambient<br>
temperature (20°C). Autocatalytic oxidants and oxidation catalysts preferred for use<br>
herein are transition metal-based, especially preferred being those of Groups V, VI, VII<br>
and VTJI of the Periodic Table such as Mn, Co, V, Mo and Ru, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Highly preferred autocatalytic oxidants for use herein include the manganates and<br>
especially potassium permanganate. Oxidation catalysts suitable for use herein include<br>
manganese dioxide itself and the manganese and cobalt catalysts described for example in<br>
WG-A-97/00311, US-A-5,246,612, US-A-4,810,410, EP-A-0408131 and US-A-<br>
5,244,594. Oxidants suitable for use in combination with the oxidation catalysts, or<br>
indeed with the autocatalytic oxidants, include the chlorine-based disinfectants, the<br>
combination of chlorine-based disinfectants and auto-catalytic oxidants being especially<br>
beneficial from the viewpoint of providing rapid and effective oxidation of soluble<br>
manganese within the timeframe of the coagulation/flocculation reaction.<br>
Preferably the compositions herein comprise from about 0.001% to about 0.15%,<br>
preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.02% to about<br>
0.06% by weight of the autocatalytic oxidant, oxidation catalyst or mixture thereof.<br>
Water treatment chemicals such as ferrous and ferric sulphate are typically manufactured<br>
from source materials having a high soluble manganese content which is retained to<br>
varying degrees in the final commercial product. While some manufacturer's take steps<br>
to minimise the soluble manganese content of their products, it has been found that for the<br>
purposes of the invention, a small proportion of soluble manganese in the coagulant is<br>
highly desirable from two viewpoints. First, it appears to promote the oxidation reaction<br>
leading to lower final levels of soluble manganese and reduced post-flocculation<br>
discoloration, especially in highly contaminated water conditions, enabling for example<br>
water containing as much as 200-300 ppb of soluble manganese to be reduced after<br>
flocculation to as little as 50 ppb or lower in some instances. Second, it provides a<br>
compensating load under conditions of low soluble manganese contamination, thereby<br>
enabling the post-flocculation level of the autocatalytic oxidant to be kept to a minimum.<br>
This is particularly important in the case of oxidant systems based on potassium<br>
permanganate which can lead to the treated water developing a pink hue if the oxidant is<br>
present in excessive amounts.<br>
Thus the compositions of the invention preferably comprise as part of the coagulant or<br>
otherwise from about 0.005% to about 0.2%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%,<br>
and more preferably from about 0.015% to about 0.05% of manganese in the form of<br>
Mn(II). The weight ratio of Mn(II) to the autocatalytic oxidant such as potassium<br>
permanganate, on the other hand, preferably lies in the range from about 1:10 to about<br>
10:1, more preferably from about 1:5 to about 5:1, and especially from about 1:2 to about<br>
2:1.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention will also generally comprise a water-<br>
soluble alkali, this being valuable from the viewpoint of delivering an optimum in-use pH<br>
profile. In general terms, the levels of primary coagulant and alkali should be adjusted so<br>
as to provide a pH at in-use concentration (generally about 620 ppm of total composition)<br>
in the range from about 6.0 to 8.5, but preferably in the range from about 6.0 to 7.0, this<br>
being preferred from the viewpoint of providing performance robustness to contaminated<br>
waters of differing contamination levels and types. To achieve the requisite pH levels, the<br>
weight ratio of primary coagulant to water-soluble alkali will generally be in the range<br>
from about 0.8:1 to about 3:1, preferably from about 0.9:1 to about 2.4:1, and more<br>
preferably from about 1:1 to about 2:1. Generally, the compositions comprise from about<br>
10% to about 45%, preferably from about 15% to about 40%, more preferably from about<br>
20% to about 35% by weight of the water-soluble alkali.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention can also include a water-insoluble<br>
silicate material such as a clay or zeolite which acts to aid the flocculation process by<br>
acting as a seed particle or by promoting absorption or cation exchange of metal ions. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of primary coagulant to water-insoluble silicate<br>
herein is from about 0.3:1 to about 5:1, preferably from about 0.7:1 to about 2:1, and<br>
more preferably from about 0.8:1 to about 1.2:1. Generally, the compositions herein<br>
comprise from about 10% to about 80%, preferably from about 20% to about 50%, more<br>
preferably from about 25% to about 35% by weight of the water-insoluble silicate.<br>
The compositions and kits herein can utilized in a variety of forms and process types<br>
including batch and continuous, but preferably the composition is in unit dosage form and<br>
is used in the batchwise purification and clarification of a relatively small predetermined<br>
volume of contaminated drinking water. By relatively small volume is meant a volume of<br>
water typically required for immediate consumption in domestic or personal use, or which<br>
is required for short term storage and consumption. Typically, the compositions herein<br>
will be used for treating a volume of contaminated drinking water in the range from about<br>
0.1 to about 100, preferably from about 0.S to about 40, more preferably from about 5 to<br>
about 20 and especially from about 8 to about 13 litres. Unit dosage amounts of the<br>
composition, on the other hand, will generally range from about SO to about 2000,<br>
preferably from about 100 to about 1000, more preferably from about 250 to about 750<br>
mg per litre of contaminated drinking water. Unit dosage forms suitable for use herein<br>
include tablets, compacts, extrudates, water-soluble single and multi-compartment<br>
pouches etc but preferred unit dosage forms are single and multi-compartment sachets<br>
comprising a unit dose of granular or powdered composition which is opened prior to use<br>
and the contents emptied into a predetermined quantity of contaminated drinking water.<br>
For the above purposes, highly preferred herein is a composition in unit dosage form<br>
comprising;<br>
(i) from about 15% to about 50%, preferably from about 25% to about 40% by weight of<br>
the primary coagulant;<br>
(ii) from about 0.2% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 3% by<br>
weight of the bridging flocculent;<br>
(iii) from about 0.5% to about 5%, more preferably from about 1% to about 4% by weight<br>
of the coagulant aid;<br>
(iv) from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 4%, more<br>
preferably from about 0.7% to about 2.5% by weight of the microbiocidal chlorine-<br>
based disinfectant; and<br>
(v) from about 0.001% to about 0.15%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%, more<br>
preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.06% by weight of a transition metal-based<br>
autocatalytic oxidant or oxidation catalyst.<br>
It is also important to ensure that in-use of the compositions, effective levels of the<br>
formulation ingredients are delivered to the sample of contaminated water to be purified.<br>
Thus the levels of primary coagulant, bridging flocculant, coagulant aid, chlorine-based<br>
disinfectant and oxidant system in composition should preferably be sufficient to provide<br>
by weight of the contaminated drinking water from about SO to about 500, preferably from<br>
about 75 to about 300, more preferably from about 100 to about 250 ppm of primary<br>
coagulant, from about 1 to about 15, preferably from about 2 to about 10, more preferably<br>
from about 2.5 to about 7.5 ppm of bridging flocculant, from about 1 to about 25,<br>
preferably from about 5 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 ppm of<br>
coagulant aid, from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 15, more<br>
preferably from about 3 to about 10 ppm of chlorine-based disinfectant, and from about<br>
10 to about 1000, preferably from about 50 to about 800, more preferably from about 100<br>
to about 400 ppb of transition metal-based autocatalytic oxidant or oxidation catalyst.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the microbiocidal disinfectant is incorporated in the<br>
compositions of the invention in a controlled, delayed, sustained or slow release form<br>
whereby the disinfectant is released into the drinking water and allowed to react with<br>
soluble organic impurities therein only after substantial completion of the coagulation and<br>
flocculation stage, this being valuable from the viewpoint of controlling and minimising<br>
the level of trihalomethanes (THM) generated during the purification process. A measure<br>
of the rate of release of disinfectant herein is tmax,, this being the time taken to achieve<br>
maximum residual disinfectant concentration after addition of the composition to<br>
deionized water at 20°C with gentle stirring. Preferably the compositions herein have a<br>
tmax, of at least about 1 minute, preferably at least about 2 minutes, more preferably at<br>
least about 4 minutes, and especially at least about 8 minutes. The rate of coagulation and<br>
flocculation of organic impurities, on the other hand, is measured by the n%-ile soluble<br>
organic matter flocculation rate (tn). The n%-ile soluble organic matter flocculation rate<br>
is defined herein as the time taken for n% reduction in the concentration of humic acid as<br>
measured according to the procedure described hereinbelow. Preferably, t80 for the<br>
compositions herein is less than about 2 minutes, preferably less than about 1 minute,<br>
more preferably less than about 30 seconds. In preferred embodiments, moreover, t90 for<br>
the compositions herein is less than about 2 minutes, preferably less than about 1 minute,<br>
more preferably less than about 30 seconds. It is a feature of the invention that the<br>
compositions herein provide effective control of the post-flocculation discoloration<br>
reaction despite the fact that for purposes of minimising THM generation and optimising<br>
disinfectancy, cyst control, etc, much of the disinfectant is released only after the<br>
completion of the coagulation and flocculation reaction.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises:<br>
(i) a primary coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble, multivalent<br>
inorganic salts and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) a microbiocidal chlorine-based disinfectant;<br>
(iii) an oxidant system providing catalytic or autocatalytic oxidation of soluble Mn(II) to<br>
MnO2; and optionally<br>
(iv) a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant;<br>
and wherein the microbiocidal disinfectant is in controlled, delayed, sustained or slow<br>
release form whereby the composition has a tmax, corresponding to the time for achieving<br>
maximum disinfectant concentration after addition to deionized water at 20°C which is<br>
greater than the 80%-ile soluble organic matter flocculation rate (t80) and preferably<br>
greater than the 90%-ile soluble organic flocculation rate (t90) of the composition.<br>
Preferably tmax is at least about 1 minute, more preferably at least about 2 minute, even<br>
more preferably at least about 4 minutes and especially at least about 8 minutes greater<br>
than t90 and preferably greater than t90.<br>
The n%-ile organic matter flocculation rate is measured on the model surface water<br>
described herein above. 620mg of the water-purification composition is added to a 1 litre<br>
sample of the model surface water with stirring. Aliquots of the liquid are then taken at<br>
30 second intervals, each aliquot being filtered through a 0.45µm filter. The colour of the<br>
aliquot is then measured using for example a Hanna HI93727 colour meter and compared<br>
with a set of standards of known humic acid concentration and colour reading. The n%-ile<br>
soluble organic matter flocculation rate is the time taken to achieve a colour reading<br>
corresponding to a humic acid level which is (100-n)% of that of the initial level (24ppm).<br>
Preferably the final colour achieved (for example post-filtration at 30 minutes and on<br>
storage for up to 72 hours) using the purification compositions of the invention either in-<br>
vivo or on model surface water is less than 20 PCU, more preferably less than IS PCU<br>
and especially less than 10 PCU. The final turbidity achieved using the purification<br>
compositions of the invention either in-vivo or on model surface water, on the other hand,<br>
is preferably less than S NTU, more preferably less than 2 NTU and especially less than 1<br>
NTU, turbidity being measured using a Jenway 6035turbidity meter calibrated daily<br>
against a S.O NTU standard.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the disinfectant and the remainder of the water-purification<br>
composition (the disinfectant-free composition) can be used in separate treatment steps,<br>
either simultaneously or sequentially with one another.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of the disinfectant-free composition to disinfectant when used<br>
separately is from 10000:1, or preferably from 5000:1 or preferably from 1000:1, or<br>
preferably from 500:1, and preferably to 2:1, or preferably to 10:1, or preferably to 25:1,<br>
or preferably to 50:1, or preferably to 100:1.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention also preferably comprise a food<br>
additive or nutrient source, this being valuable from the viewpoint of providing drinking<br>
water which is not only pure but which also contains essential minerals and other food<br>
additives necessary for good health and nutrition. The food additive or nutrient source<br>
can be included in the kits of the invention as one or more separate compositions in unit<br>
dosage form, or they can be incorporated directly into the water-purification composition<br>
itself.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying, clarifying and nullifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises:<br>
(i) a primary coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble,<br>
multivalent inorganic salts and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant;<br>
(iii) a microbiocidal chlorine-based disinfectant;<br>
(iv) an oxidant system providing catalytic or autocatalytic oxidation of soluble Mn(II)<br>
to MnO2; and<br>
(v) a food additive or nutrient source.<br>
In the case of food additives and nutrient sources which are non-coagulable or which at<br>
least partially survive the coagulation and flocculation process, for example fluoridating<br>
agents, iodinating agents, and essential minerals such as zinc and iron, the food additive<br>
or flocculent can be incorporated without special measures into the water purification<br>
composition. Otherwise, the food additive or nutrient sources can also be incorporated in<br>
controlled, delayed, sustained or slow release form as described herein with respect to the<br>
disinfectant. In this instance, the composition should have has a tmax corresponding to the<br>
time for achieving maximum nutrient concentration after addition to deionized water at<br>
20°C which is greater than the 80%-ile soluble organic flocculation rate (tso) and<br>
preferably greater than the 90%-ile soluble organic flocculation rate (t90) of the<br>
composition.<br>
It is also desirable herein to control the free moisture content of the water-purification<br>
compositions, especially in those compositions of the invention comprising calcium<br>
hypochlorite as microbiocidal disinfectant. It should be understood that many of the<br>
ingredients of the compositions herein such as the bentonite clays, alum based coagulants,<br>
etc contain a natural amount of free moisture and this has been found to be especially<br>
detrimental to calcium hypochlorite stability. In preferred embodiments, therefore, the<br>
compositions of the invention should have a free-moisture content of less than about 6%,<br>
preferably less than about 4% and more especially less than about 2.5% by weight thereof.<br>
It is also highly desirable to incorporate one or more ingredients which are capable of<br>
acting as a moisture sink, for example, low-moisture, pre-dried clays and hydratable salts<br>
in anhydrous or partly hydrated form whereby the free moisture content of the<br>
composition is maintained below the theoretical amount necessary for 100% hydration of<br>
the components of the composition. Particularly preferred moisture sinks include pre-<br>
dried clays and aluminosilicates, anhydrous sodium carbonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the moisture sinks have a free moisture content of less than about 4%, more<br>
preferably less than about 3%, especially less than about 2.5% and more especially less<br>
than about 1.5% by weight. Free moisture content of the product or moisture sink is<br>
determined as follows. A 2g sample of the product or moisture sink is extracted into 50<br>
mis of dry methanol at room temperature for 20 mins. A 1 ml aliquot of this solution is<br>
then taken and the free moisture determined by a standard Karl Fischer titration. The free<br>
moisture is expressed as the percentage weight of water relative to the sample weight (in<br>
this case 2g).<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises:<br>
(i) a primary coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble,<br>
multivalent inorganic salts and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant;<br>
(iii) calcium hypochlorite as microbiocidal disinfectant;<br>
(iv) an oxidant system providing catalytic or autocatalytic oxidation of soluble Mn(H)<br>
to MnO2; and optionally<br>
a moisture sink, and wherein the composition has a free-moisture content of less than<br>
about 6%, preferably less than about 4% and more especially less than about 2.5% by<br>
weight thereof.<br>

ranges, a coagulant aid, a disinfectant neutralization agent; a water-soluble alkali, a water-<br>

nutrient source.<br>

subsequent to said separation stage in order in order to maintain drinking water purity<br>
during storage of the drinking water but to reduce or remove excess disinfectant prior to<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Primary Coaeulant<br>
Primary coagulants suitable for use herein include water-soluble inorganic salts and<br>
mixtures thereof. In highly preferred embodiments, the composition herein comprises an<br>
inorganic metal salt selected from the group consisting of iron sulphate, iron chloride,<br>
manganese sulphate, manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, aluminium<br>
sulphate, aluminium chloride, poly- variations thereof, and combinations thereof. The<br>
inorganic metal salt of the composition of the present invention is selected on the basis<br>
that it can act as a coagulant and can interact with charged water-soluble impurities in<br>
such a manner so as to neutralise the charge of said water-soluble impurity to form a<br>
water-insoluble impurity, usually to form a water-insoluble salt of said impurity, which<br>
precipitates out of solution. The inorganic salt of the composition of the invention can<br>
also lower the turbidity of the water by increasing the particle size of the water-insoluble<br>
impurities possibly causing sedimentation or facilitating the removal of these water-<br>
insoluble impurities by filtration or other water-insoluble matter removal techniques such<br>
as flotation or decanting. The inorganic salts selected herein, can also co-precipitate heavy<br>
metal ions out of water, and can also lower the total organic content present in the water<br>
by coagulating or adsorption of this organic content onto the water-insoluble impurities<br>
which have been formed in the water.<br>
Preferably the inorganic metal salt of the composition of the invention is a multivalent,<br>
preferably a di- or tri-valent, inorganic metal salt such as, aluminium III sulphate, iron II<br>
(ferrous) sulphate or iron m (ferric) sulphate. A most preferred inorganic metal salt for<br>
use herein is iron III sulphate. The term "inorganic metal salt" includes all poly- variations<br>
thereof such as polyaluminum chloride and polyferric material, but does not include<br>
compounds comprising methyl or ethyl groups. The inorganic metal salt is preferably free<br>
of carbon atoms. The term "inorganic metal salts which are free of carbon atoms"<br>
includes sources of inorganic metal salts which comprise minor amounts of carbon<br>
impurity such as often found in naturally occurring inorganic metal salt sources. For<br>
example, preferred inorganic metal salts of the composition of the invention comprise (by<br>
weight of said salt) less than 5%, more preferably less than 3%, more preferably less than<br>
1%, even more preferably less than 0.1%, even more preferably less than 0.01% carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
Particularly preferred are those inorganic metal salts which are a source of acid, such as<br>
aluminium HI sulphate or iron sulphate. This is especially true when the composition<br>
herein also comprises a source of carbonate such as sodium carbonate, since the acid<br>
source, and carbonate source, may react together to form a gas. This process is known as<br>
effervescence and helps to disperse the composition herein, especially when the<br>
composition herein is in the form of a tablet.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 50%, or preferably to 40%, or preferably to 30%<br>
inorganic salt selected from the group consisting of iron sulphate, iron chloride,<br>
manganese sulphate, manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, aluminium<br>
sulphate, aluminium chloride, poly- variations thereof, and combinations thereof.<br>
Coagulant Aid<br>
The water purification composition herein preferably comprises a coagulant aid<br>
(sometimes referred to herein as 'first polymeric material'). Highly preferred are<br>
polymeric materials which comprises an amine group and which are therefore cationic in<br>
nature. The first polymeric material is selected on the basis that it can aid the coagulation<br>
and flocculation process and in particular can in conjunction with the primary coagulant<br>
aid particle adherence and the aggregation of water-insoluble particles into larger water-<br>
insoluble aggregated complexes known as floes. The first polymeric material may also<br>
adsorb or coagulate oils, fats and other organic or inorganic matter, and may sequester<br>
heavy metal ions.<br>
The term "amine group" is defined herein as including primary amine groups, secondary<br>
amine groups, tertiary amine groups, quaternary amine groups such as quaternary<br>
ammonium groups, but the term "amine group" does not include amide groups. Said<br>
amine group can be the group linking die monomeric units of the backbone of the<br>
polymeric material, or may be present as a side group of the polymeric material, for<br>
example as an amine side group of a polysaccharidc. Preferably the amine group is<br>
present as a side group.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric material is substantially water-insoluble. "Substantially water-<br>
insoluble" is defined herein as having at least 10% by dry total weight of undissolved<br>
material present as determined by the following method:<br>
1g material is added to 1 litre of distilled water at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.0, at 20°C<br>
and stirred vigorously for 24 hours. The water is then filtered through a 3 micrometer<br>
filter, and the undissolved material which is collected by the filter step is dried at 80°C<br>
until constant weight, typically for 24 to 48 hours. The weight of this undissolved material<br>
is then determined and the % dry weight of this undissolved material can be calculated.<br>
The amine group of the first polymeric material is preferably at least partly protonated<br>
when the first polymeric material comes into contact with water, typically this protonation<br>
reaction occurs at a pH of below 9.0, and preferably at a pH of from 3 to 8. Thus,<br>
preferably the first polymeric material is cationic when in a solution of water at a pH of<br>
below 9. Alternatively, the amine group of the first polymeric material may already be in a<br>
charged state, for example a substituted or protonated state. The amine group of the first<br>

may be a preferred source of first polymeric material for use herein.<br>
Chitosan suitable for use herein is typically derived from the chitin of Crustacea such as<br>
crabs, lobsters and shrimps. Chitosan derived from the chitin of fungi can also be used<br>
herein. The chitosan for use herein is typically found in the shells of Crustacea and can be<br>
extracted by any technique known in the art, for example by using the extraction<br>
techniques described in US3533940, US3862122, US3922260 and US4195175.<br>

substantially water-soluble at in-use concentrations and has a weight average molecular<br>
weight of at least about 100,000, preferably at least about 2000000. The second polymeric<br>
material is selected on the basis that it can act as flocculent and cause the aggregation of<br>
water-insoluble particles into larger water-insoluble aggregated complexes known as<br>
floes. It is believed that the ability of the second polymeric material to act as a flocculent,<br>

Magnafloc LT20, Magnafloc LT25, Magnafloc LT25S, Magnafloc LT26, Magnafloc<br>
LT28, Magnafloc 351 and Magnafloc 919.<br>
It is preferred that a low amount of substantially water-soluble organic content is present<br>
in the composition herein. The term "low amount of substantially water-soluble content"<br>
can be determined by the following method:<br>
500mg of said composition is added to 1 litre of deionised water which comprises no<br>
detectable amounts of substantially water-soluble organic content, to form a solution.<br>
Said solution is left with occasional stirring for 30 minutes and is then filtered through<br>
Whatman GF/C paper having an average pore size of 1.2 micrometers to obtain purified<br>
water. The level of total organic content (TOC) of said purified water is determined using<br>
the ISO method 8245:1999. A composition comprising "a substantially low amount of<br>
water-soluble content" is defined as a composition which gives a TOC of said purified<br>
water of less than 10ppm, preferably less than 7ppm, more preferably less than 4ppm<br>
when determined using this method.<br>
It is also preferred that a low amount of substantially water-soluble organic content is<br>

preferably to 20%, or preferably to 10%, or preferably to 5%, or preferably to 3% second<br>
polymeric material.<br>
Microbiocidal Disinfectant<br>
The composition herein comprises a microbiocidal disinfectant (sometimes referred to<br>
herein as the disinfecting agent). The disinfecting agent may comprise any compound<br>
which disinfects or sanitises water. The disinfecting agent may be inorganic such as silver<br>
salts, colloidal silver, nanosilver, ozone, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, sodium hypochlorite<br>
or chloramine. The disinfecting agent may also be organic such as a quaternary<br>
ammonium compound. Preferred disinfecting agents include inorganic chlorine based<br>
disinfectants, wherein the chlorine is in a formal oxidation state that is not minus one,<br>
preferably above minus one. Preferred sources of chlorine comprise hypochlorites<br>
(especially calcium hypochlorite) and organic sources of chlorine such as isocyanurates.<br>
Other suitable disinfecting agents comprise iodine and sources of iodine such as<br>

As previously discussed, the disinfecting agent is preferably used in a controlled, delayed,<br>
sustained or slow release form. Means for providing such controlled, delayed, sustained<br>
or slow release (hereafter 'means for providing delayed release') can include blending or<br>
coating the disinfecting agent with, for example, a poorly water-soluble or hydrophobic<br>
material, or providing a coating of sufficient thickness that the kinetics of dissolution of<br>
the coating provide delayed release. Poorly water-soluble or hydrophobic materials<br>
include waxes, paraffins, silicas, zeolites, clays, polymeric resins, celluloses, cross-linked<br>
polymers, insoluble salts such as calcium carbonate, etc. The coating material can be<br>
applied by agglomeration in, for example, pan, rotary drum and vertical blenders, or by<br>
spray atomization. Other means for providing delayed release include mechanical means<br>
for altering the physical properties of the disinfecting agent, for example, compaction,<br>
granulation means for altering the particle size distribution of the disinfecting agent, etc.<br>
Highly preferred herein from the viewpoint of achieving optimum flocculation and<br>
disinfectancy performance in water contaminated with high levels of organic impurities is<br>
a particulate disinfecting agent, preferably calcium hypochlorite, having a particle size<br>
distribution such that at least about 50%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at<br>
least about 90% by weight is retained on a 210 nm (Tyler 65 mesh) screen, preferably on<br>
a 425 µm (35 mesh) screen, more preferably on a 600 µm (28 mesh) screen, yet more<br>
preferably on a 710 µm (24 mesh) screen, even more preferably on a 850 urn (20 mesh)<br>

In order to minimise random sampling variance in the final unit dose composition, it is<br>
also preferred that the particulate disinfecting agent has a particle size distribution such<br>
that at least about 50%, preferably at least about 75% by weight thereof passes through a<br>
2000 urn (9 mesh) screen and more preferably through a 1400 µm (12 mesh) screen.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 0.01%, or preferably from<br>
0.1%, or preferably from 0.2%, or preferably from 0.5%, or preferably from 0.7%, or<br>

2.5% disinfecting agent.<br>
Oxidant System<br>
The oxidant systems suitable for use herein have been described in detail above. Highly<br>
preferred are the autocatalytic oxidants such as the manganates and especially potassium<br>
permanganate. Such systems are autocatalytic in the sense that the product of the reaction<br>
with soluble manganese, colloidal manganese dioxide, itself acts to catalyse the oxidation<br>
reaction, thereby enabling rapid oxidation within the timeframe of the<br>
coagulation/flocculation reaction.<br>
Preferably the compositions herein comprise from about 0.001% to about 0.15%,<br>
preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.02% to about<br>

Water-Insoluble Silicate<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises a water-insoluble silicate selected from<br>
clays, zeolites and mixtures thereof.<br>
Highly preferred silicates for use herein are clays. The clay acts as a seed particle onto<br>
which water-insoluble impurities can aggregate to form floes. The presence of clay in the<br>
composition improves the rate of floe formation and allows the formation of larger floes<br>
compared to when clay is absent from the composition herein. The clay may also act as a<br>
swelling agent, and if the composition herein is in the form of a tablet, the clay improves<br>
the rate at which the tablet disintegrates on contact with water by swelling upon contact<br>
with water so that the components of the tablet are pushed apart by the swollen clay<br>
particles. The clay can also act as a desiccant within the tablet. The clay may also act as a<br>
cationic exchange agent to remove metal ions from the water and the clay can also<br>
remove colour, heavy metals and some organic material from water by adsorption.<br>
The clay is preferably a smectite clay, preferably a dioctahedral smectite clay such as<br>
montmorillonite clay or a trioctahedral smectite clay such as hectorite clay. Those clays<br>
found in bentonite clay deposits are also preferred. Particularly preferred clays for use<br>
herein include laponite clay, hectorite, montmorillonite, nontronite, saponite, volkonsite,<br>
sauconite, beidellite, allevarlite, illite, halloysite and attapulgite. In compositions<br>
containing calcium hypochlorite, the free moisture content of the clay should be carefully<br>
controlled to provide acceptable disinfectant stability. Preferably the free moisture<br>
content should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%, especially less<br>
than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight. Free moisture<br>
content is determined on a 2g sample of the test material following the procedure as<br>
described hereinabove.<br>
Highly preferred for use herein from the viewpoint of providing optimum disinfectant<br>
stability are pre-dried clays which in their dessicated form have the potential to scavenge<br>
or pick up moisture. Such clays can be described in terms of their so-called 'water-<br>
capacity', defined herein as the equilibrium weight percentage of moisture picked up by a<br>
small sample (e.g. 10mg) of the dessicated material from air at 80% relative humidity and<br>
20°C as measured by dynamic vapour sorption techniques. For example, if 10mg of the<br>
dessicated clay picks up 2mg moisture, the dessicated clay has a water capacity of 20%.<br>
Preferred for use herein are dessicated clays having a water capacity of at least about 10%,<br>
preferably at least about 15%, and more preferably at least about 18%.<br>

5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
clay.<br>
Aluminosilicates may be used herein in place of, or in addition to, clay. The<br>
aluminosilicate can act as a cationic exchange agent to remove metal ions from water, and<br>
can also act as a seed particle to enhance floc formation and as dessicant for enhancing<br>
disinfectant stability. Preferred aluminosilicates for use herein include zeolite A, zeolite<br>
X, zeolite Y, zeolite P and zeolite beta. Preferably the free moisture content of the<br>
aluminosilcate should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%,<br>
especially less than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight.<br>
Highly preferred for use herein from the viewpoint of providing optimum disinfectant<br>
stability are pre-dried aluminosilicates which in their dessicated form have the potential to<br>
scavenge or pick up moisture. Such dessicated aluminosilicates can also be described in<br>
terms of their so-called 'water-capacity', as defined hereinabove. Preferred for use herein<br>
are dessicated aluminsilicates having a water capacity of at least about 10%, preferably at<br>
least about 15%, and more preferably at least about 18%.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
aluminosilicate.<br>
A third polymeric material<br>
The composition herein may comprise a third polymeric material. Said third polymeric<br>
material does not contain an amine group and is substantially water insoluble. The term<br>
"substantially water insoluble" is defined hereinbefore. Thus, the third polymeric material<br>
is different to, and is not, the first polymeric material or the second polymeric material.<br>
The third polymeric material is selected on the basis that it can act as a seed particle to<br>
enhance floe formation. The third polymeric material can be used in place of, or in<br>
addition to, clay or zeolite. Preferably the free moisture content of the third polymeric<br>
material should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%, especially less<br>
than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight.<br>
Preferably the third polymeric material comprises cellulose, more preferably the third<br>
polymeric material is an unmodified cellulose. Most preferably the third polymeric<br>
material comprises powdered cellulose.<br>

5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
third polymeric material.<br>
Alkali agent<br>
The composition herein may comprise an alkali agent. The alkali agent can be any<br>
compound which gives alkalinity when contacted to water. The alkali agent for use herein<br>
is not a polymeric material. The composition herein preferably comprises an amount of<br>
alkali agent such that when the composition herein is contacted to water to form a<br>
solution, said solution has a pH of from 5 to 8, preferably from 6 to 7.<br>
Preferred alkali agents are selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate,<br>
sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, potassium carbonate, potassium<br>
bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, potassium oxide and combinations thereof.<br>
Particular alkali agents which are a source of carbonate when contacted to water, for<br>
example sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate may be preferred for used herein. If the<br>
composition herein comprises a source of acid, for example an inorganic salt of the<br>
composition of the present invention such as iron sulphate, said alkali agent which is a<br>
source of carbonate can interact with said acid source in the presence of water to produce<br>
a gas. This process is known as effervescence, and improves the rate at which the<br>
composition disperses, especially when the composition herein is in the form of a tablet.<br>
Highly preferred herein, especially in compositions containing calcium hypochorite as<br>
disinfecting agent, are alkalis which can also act as moisture sinks, especially anhydrous<br>
sodium carbonate.<br>
The composition herein typically comprises (by weight) from 1% to 50%, preferably from<br>
10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or preferably from 25%, and<br>
preferably to 45%, or preferably to 40%, or preferably to 35% alkali agent.<br>
Composition<br>
The composition herein is preferably in a solid unit dose form, most preferably in a tablet<br>
or powder form. The composition herein is preferably packaged so that it is protected<br>
from environmental conditions such as moisture. Preferably the composition herein is<br>
packaged in a water impermeable material such as polypropylene or typical laminates. An<br>
example of one such laminate is a laminate supplied by Akerlund &amp; Raus, comprising<br>

ethylene/methacrylate co-polymer) - an FDA approved food packaging.<br>
Method for use<br>
The composition herein can be used to purify water using a method comprising the steps<br>
of (a) contacting die composition herein to water to obtain partially purified water<br>
comprising solid matter; and (b) removing at least part of said solid matter from said<br>
partially purified water by, (i) filtration; or (ii) decanting; or (iii) sedimentation; or (iv)<br>
flotation; or (v) a combination thereof, to obtain purified water.<br>
The composition herein can be in the form of a tablet or solid powder which is added to<br>
water, typically to form partially purified water comprising solid matter such as floes.<br>
This solid matter can be removed or separated from the remaining part of the partially<br>
purified water by any technique, typically by filtration but decanting, sedimentation and<br>
flotation may also be used. By filtration it is meant passing the partially purified water<br>
through a filter. Filtration can occur by pouring means, for example by pouring said<br>
partially purified water through a filter to remove at least part of the solid matter from<br>
said partially purified water. Filtration can also occur by centripetal force means, for<br>
example by total enclosing the partially purified water by a filter and spinning said<br>
partially purified water and said filter so that said partially purified water passes through<br>
said filter and at least part of said solid matter is separated from said partially purified<br>
water. Filtration can also occur by plunging means, for example by plunging or moving a<br>
filter through said partially purified water so that at least part of said solid matter is<br>
separated from said partially purified water.<br>
Filters typically used include cloth filters, non-woven and paper filters and polishing<br>
filters, such as filters comprising activated carbon, glass fibre, zeolite, ion exchange<br>
media, or a combination thereof, which remove residual water-impurities, e.g. organic<br>
matter, heavy metal ions and residual disinfectant from the water. Filters suitable for use<br>
may be impregnated with silver or other biostatic components so that bacteria cannot<br>
grow on said filter and the filter can be reused several times without contaminating the<br>
water being filtered. Sand filters can also be used, and more than one filter may be used in<br>
combination herein.<br>
Preferably, from 10mg, or preferably from 50mg, or preferably from 75mg, or preferably<br>
from 100mg, or preferably from 150mg, or preferably from 200mg, or preferably from<br>
250mg, or preferably from 300mg, and preferably to 2000mg, or preferably to 1000mg, or<br>
preferably to 750mg of composition herein is added to 1 litre of water. The amount of<br>
composition herein which is added to the water depends on the impurity of said water. For<br>
example, less composition is needed to adequately purify water which is not very impure<br>
compared to the amount of composition herein which is needed to purify very impure<br>
water.<br>
