				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the treatment of mineral resources and may be used in<br>
the processing of mineral substances which contain nonferrous, black, rare and<br>
noble metals and also nonmetallic mineral resources. The invention relates to a<br>
pneumatic flotation column according to the preamble of patent claim 1 for<br>
treatment of mineral resources.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The pneumatic flotation machine protected by Russian Federation patent no.<br>
2038865, B 03 D 1/24, is known. The machine contains a chamber with an<br>
aerator within the chamber, a foam overflow edge, a feed device as a tube with<br>
orifices and a circulation tube.<br>
The pneumatic flotation machine is known which contains a chamber with an<br>
aerator within the chamber, a feed and discharge device, and an airlift arranged<br>
in the middle of the chamber and having a mixer in the lower part (see Russian<br>
Federation patent no. 2054972, B 03 D1/24).<br>
The most similar to this in terms of its technical principle is the pneumatic<br>
flotation column which contains a cylindrical housing, consisting of the widened<br>
upper part and of the lower part, a feed device, designed as ejectors, a<br>
discharge device, aerators, a foam collecting container, a device, designed as an<br>
airlift, for the fine regulation of the pulp level in the machine, the annular baffle<br>
plate, which in cross section represents a triangle, the vertex of which is directed<br><br>
toward the machine axis, and a telescope-shaped chamber which is located in<br>
the widened housing part (see Russian Federation patent no. 2132749, B 03 D<br>
1/24).<br>
A known pneumatic flotation column, protected by Russian Federation patent no.<br>
2132749, B 03 D 1/24, was implemented in the machine KFM-1400<br>
(development of the "Uralmachanobr" Institute) and has the dimensions listed in<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br>
The known machine has the disadvantage that, when the required performance<br>
in terms of the feed and foam product is increased, the housing dimensions<br>
increase unjustifiably and thereby contribute to an appreciable rise in material<br>
intensity.<br>
Furthermore, as compared with mechanical and pneumatic machines of the<br>
same volume, the known machine has a smaller area for foam formation and a<br>
smaller geometric length of the discharge weir (see Table 2).<br>
Design parameters of the known flotation column and of the<br>
pneumatic/mechanical flotation machine<br><br>
On account of this, the flotation process in the known flotation column has a<br>
series of disadvantages: the aeroflocks which form (structures consisting of air<br>
bubbles and of mineral particles) dwell for longer in the pulp than in mechanical<br><br>
and pneumatic machines from the moment of occurrence to the moment of<br>
supply to the foam product, and, because of a lack of free space on the<br>
pulpsurface, aeroflock collision and mutual annihilation processes take place in<br>
the foam layer. The disadvantages of the flotation process in the known flotation<br>
column cause the lowering of its performance downstream of the foam product<br>
and lead to the situation where it does not function with sufficient efficiency in<br>
flotation stages with a rich initial raw material, where a high yield of the foam<br>
product is required.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The technical object which the invention is aimed at achieving is an increase in<br>
machine productivity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The set technical object is achieved in that the diameter of the widened housing<br>
part in the known machine, which contains a cylindrical housing consisting of a<br>
widened upper part and of the lower part, a feed, aeration and discharge device<br>
designed as ejectors, a discharge device and a foam collecting container, was<br>
determined by means of the following equation:<br><br>
D - the diameter of the widened upper part of the cylindrical housing;<br><br><br>
k 1 - an empirical coefficient for calculating the diameter of the widened upper<br>
part of the cylindrical housing, preferably selected from 1.0 to 1.4;<br>
h 1 - the height of the widened upper part of the housing, with the following<br>
relation h1=k2 h2;<br>
k2—an empirical coefficient for calculating the height of the widened upper part<br>
of the cylindrical housing, selected from 0.2 to 1.0;<br>
h 2 - the height of the lower part of the cylindrical housing;<br>
d - the diameter of the lower part of the cylindrical housing which is dependent<br>
on the required machine performance in terms of the feed material according to<br>
the equation d2 =k 3 -Q;<br>
Q - the required machine performance in terms of the feed material, preferably<br>
determined in the dimension unit of metric tons per hour (t/h);<br>
k 3 - an empirical coefficient for calculating the diameter of the lower part of the<br>
cylindrical housing, selected from 0.015 to 0.03.<br>
Thus, on the one hand, an increase in machine productivity in terms of the foam<br>
product by an enlargement in area of the widened upper part of the cylindrical<br>
housing is brought about and, at the same time, a lowering of material intensity<br>
by the optimization of the dimensions is effected.<br>
The object is also achieved by means of a method for confiqurating a pneumatic<br>
flotation column, using the equation described above.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the foam collecting container of the pneumatic flotation column<br>
may, in an advantageous development of the invention, be design as a gable-<br>
shaped channel and be equipped with opposite connection pieces for discharge<br>
of the foam product.<br>
Advantageously, the gable-shaped channel, that is to say the gable-shaped foam<br>
channel, is mounted in such a way that surfaces on the basic flotation chamber 1<br>
remain free, that is to say are available, for mounting one or more ejectors<br>
and/or other attachments.<br>
The described design of the foam collecting container, implemented as a gable-<br>
shaped channel, allows almost a twofold reduction in its height, while a sufficient<br>
angle of inclination of the bottom is maintained.<br>
The optimal diameter of the lower part of the cylindrical housing of the flotation<br>
column depends on the quantity of the pulp throughput, that is to say on the<br>
machine performance in terms of the feed material. As experimental<br>
investigations have shown, for the flotation machine with a diameter of the lower<br>
part of the housing of 1.4 m the optimal performance in terms of the feed<br>
material is 60 to 120 t/h (in terms of the pulp 160 to 320 m2/n). The throughout<br>
capacity of the machine in terms of the pulp was determined by means of the<br>
cross-sectional area of the lower part of the housing, the formula of which<br>
contains the diameter of the lower part of the housing, squared. Thus, the<br>
square of the optimal diameter of the lower part of the machine housing and its<br><br><br>
performance are linked by means of the equation d2 = k3 • Q, where the<br>
proportionality coefficient k3 may assume the values of 0.015 to 0.03.<br>
It was found in experimental investigations that, in the pneumatic flotation<br>
column, the optimal penetration depth of the feed and aeration device (ejector)<br>
into the pulp, which determines the height h1 of the widened upper part of the<br>
cylindrical housing, is 1 to 2 m, and the optimal penetration depth of the aeration<br>
device (disperser), which determines the overall machine height h1 + h2, is 4 to<br>
6m. Overshooting said values of the penetration depth into the pulp by the<br>
ejector and disperser leads to an unjustifiable increase in the overall height and<br>
the material intensity of the flotation machine, without an increase in its<br>
performance in terms of the feed and foam product. Hence, the optimal values<br>
h1 and h2, are linked by the equation h1 = k2 h2, in which the proportionality<br>
coefficient k2 may assume the values of 0.2 to 1.0.<br>
In experimental investigations, the dependence of the performance of the<br>
flotation column in terms of the foam product, in the case of the basic flotation<br>
of the copper-containing raw material, on the diameter of the widened upper<br>
part of the cylindrical housing and the overall height of the apparatus was<br>
determined (Table 3).	<br>
Table 3<br>
Dependence of the flotation characteristic numbers of the copper-containing raw<br>
material on the diameter of the widened upper part of the cylindrical housing<br>
and the overall height of the column apparatus.<br><br><br>
It is clear from the data listed in Table 3 that the optimal flotation results were<br>
achieved in the flotation machine, of which the diameter of the widened upper<br>
part D is linked to the diameter of the lower part d and the overall height of the<br>
apparatus h 1 +h 2 by the following equation:<br>
means of the following equation:<br><br>
In order to increase the conveying capacity of the foam collecting container in<br>
terms of the foam product, while at the same time reducing its height, the foam<br>
collecting container was designed as a gable-shaped channel and equipped with<br>
opposite connection pieces for discharging the foam product.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention is explained by way of example with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the pneumatic flotation column according to the invention in an<br>
overall view illustrated in half section as a front view,<br>
Figure 2 shows a side view of the pneumatic flotation column according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows a top view of the pneumatic flotation column according to the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The pneumatic flotation column, that is to say the flotation machine, contains the<br>
basic flotation chamber 1 with the gable-shaped foam channel 2, within which<br>
the postflotation chamber 3 is accommodated. The chamber 1 is equipped with<br>
feed and aeration devices—ejectors 4, and the chamber 3 is equipped with an<br>
aeration device 5 which is accommodated in the lower part of the postflotation<br>
chamber 3. The postflotation chamber 3 is equipped with the bottom discharge<br>
device 6 and the foam channel 2 is equipped with connection pieces for<br>
discharging the foam product 7. The postflotation chamber 3 is provided with an<br>
annular baffle plate 8.<br>
The flotation machine shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 has a diameter D of the widened<br><br><br>
upper part of the cylindrical housing which is larger than the diameter D of the<br>
lower part of the cylindrical housing of the flotation machine. The height of the<br>
widened upper part of the cylindrical housing is designated by h1. The height of<br>
the lower part of the cylindrical housing of the flotation machine is designated by<br>
h2. The overall height of the flotation machine is accordingly obtained as h1 + h2.<br>
The flotation machine shown functions in the following way.<br>
The pulp, previously processed by means of reagents, passes via the ejector 4<br>
into the basic flotation chamber 1. At the same time, air is supplied to the ejector<br>
4 and comes into contact with hydrophobic grains of the pulp, aeroflocks being<br>
obtained. The aeroflocks, when they float up, form the foam product. The foam<br>
product is discharged into the foam channel 2 and is delivered via the connection<br>
pieces 7 for thickening (not illustrated in the drawing). The grains having an<br>
insufficiently hydrophobic surface and the hydrophilic grains are supplied to the<br>
postflotation chamber 3. In the postflotation chamber 3, the aeroflocks arise<br>
which form the foam product in the upper part of the postflotation chamber 3.<br>
The annular baffle plate 8 makes it possible to make contact between the<br>
mineral and the air bubbles not in countercurrent, but, instead, at an angle, that<br>
is to say to create optimal conditions for the flotation of the grains in the<br>
postflotation chamber 3 . The hydrophilic grains sink onto the bottom part of the<br>
postflotation chamber 3 and are discharged via the bottom discharge device 6.<br>
The foam product passes out of the postflotation chamber 3 over its top edge<br>
onto the foam layer of the basic flotation chamber and subsequently into the<br>
foam channel 2.<br><br>
The flotation machine according to an embodiment was tested, in the case of the<br>
basic flotation of copper-containing ore, in comparison with the known machine<br>
KFM-1400. The test results are illustrated in Table 4.<br><br>
The results in Table 4 show clearly that the design according to an embodiment<br>
of the pneumatic flotation column, by increasing the diameter of the widened<br>
upper part of the cylindrical housing and by optimizing the dimensions, makes it<br><br>
possible to have an increase in performance in terms of the foam product, while<br>
at the same time lowering its volume and the material intensity.<br>
The invention is aimed at increasing the machine productivity in terms of the<br>
foam product by enlarging the area of the widened upper part of the cylindrical<br>
housing and by lowering the material intensity by optimizing its dimensions. Said<br>
result is achieved in that, in the known machine which contains a cylindrical<br>
housing, consisting of a widened upper part and of the lower part, a feed,<br>
aeration and discharge device designed as ejectors, a discharge device and a<br>
foam collecting container, the diameter of the widened housing part was<br>
determined by means of an equation as a function of the diameter of the lower<br>
part of the cylindrical housing, of the height of the widened upper part of the<br>
cylindrical housing and of the height of the lower part of the cylindrical housing.<br>
Furthermore, the foam collecting container of the pneumatic flotation column is<br>
designed as a gable-shaped channel and is equipped with opposite connection<br>
pieces for discharging the foam product.<br><br>
