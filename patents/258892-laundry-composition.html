- 1 -LAUNDRY COMPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
5  The present invention relates to polymer particles<br>
comprising a perfume and a nonionic deposition aid and their uses, such as delivery of the perfume to fabric during laundering.  Laundry treatment compositions containing particles according to the invention, provide deposition 10  efficiency benefits during washing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The deposition of a perfume onto a substrate, such as a 15  fabric, is a well known method of imparting perfume<br>
properties to the substrate.  In laundry applications deposition of a perfume is used, for example, during fabric treatment processes such as fabric conditioning.  Methods of deposition are diverse and include deposition during the 20  wash or rinse stages of the laundry process or direct<br>
deposition before or after the wash, such as by spraying or rubbing or by use of impregnated sheets during tumble drying or water additives during steam ironing.<br>
25  The perfume is often incorporated into a carrier or delivery system.  Carrier systems for perfumes are typically based on encapsulation or entrapment within a matrix.  The perfume may simply be emulsified but problems with poor retention or stability exist and deposition onto a substrate, such as<br>
30  fabric, is often inefficient.  Diffusion of the perfume into a carrier suffers from complex preparation including time of<br><br>
WO 2007/062733<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/010715<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
diffusion; poor retention of the perfume in the matrix and subsequent poor substrate deposition are also common problems.<br>
After deposition onto a surface, a problem exists in that longevity of adherence to that surface of the perfume, in a surfactant containing environment, is inherently poor because surfactants are characteristically very efficient at combining with perfumes.  This results in a perfume which has been deposited onto a fabric being washed cff during a main wash, or in the perfume being leached from its carrier in the wash liquor thus becoming unavailable for deposition onto the fabric.  Protection of the perfume is, therefore, required before and after it has been deposited onto a surface.  In the context of laundry products, the need for protection from surfactants of perfumes promotes the need for new protection systems.  By protection benefit as  used herein is meant protection of the perfume from the action of surfactants during a wash process, for example as suggested above.  Thus the protection of perfumes within a formulation in an aqueous environment and longevity of the perfume deposited onto a fabric are both desirable goals.<br>
Protection from the action of surfactants and longevity of deposition on a substrate are particular needs for perfumes as the volatile nature and low molecular weight of perfume components make them susceptible to diffusing OUt of carrier systems during laundering and evaporating quickly from substrates after deposition.<br><br>

Our co-pending patent application, PCT/EP2005/004779, unpublished at the filing date of this application, is 5  directed towards a process, which uses miniemulsion<br>
polymerisation, for the preparation of polysaccharide/ polymer conjugate particles containing a lubricant.  Certain particles produced by the process and uses thereof are also disclosed.  The particles facilitate deposition of the 10  lubricant to fabric during the main wash part of a laundering process.<br>
Our co-pending patent applications, GE 0513803.7 and<br>
GB 051805.2, both unpublished at the filing date of this<br>
15  application, are directed towards miniemulsion polymer<br>
particles (with and without a shell respectively) comprising a benefit agent, preferably a sugar polyester, which may be delivered to fabric during laundering.  These particles give long lasting adherence of the benefit agent to fabric during<br>
20  laundering.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that a perfume can be efficiently deposited onto a fabric if a carrier system based on a colloidal particle comprising a polymer, a<br>
25  perfume and a nonionic deposition aid, such as locust bean gum is employed.  The perfume is not post-absorbed/adsorbed into/onto the particle, but instead is incorporated into the particle as the particle is formed.  The carrier system further provides protection and longevity of adherence to<br>
30  the perfume.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

of greater than about 30 g/litre, preferably greater than 35 g/litre, for example 40 to 45  g/litre in water (distilled or equivalent) at 25Â°C.  Such monomers may be utilised in a monomer mixture at levels of up to 10 % based on weight of 5  monomers used.<br>
The surface of the particle (with the shell) may comprise hydrophilic or hyrdrophobic moieties, the nature of which are determined by the choice of the monomer used to produce 10  the particle.

15  The Deposition Aid<br>
The polymer particle of the invention comprises a deposition aid, which is nonionic.<br>
2 0  Preferably, the deposition aid is a polysaccharide.  The polysaccharide preferably has a Â£-1,4-linked backbone.<br>
Preferably the polysaccharide is a cellulose, a cellulose derivative, or another |3-1, 4-linked polysaccharide having an<br>
25  affinity for cellulose, such as polymannan, polyglucan,<br>
poiyglucomannan, polyxyloglucan and polygalactomannan or a mixture thereof.  More preferably, the polysaccharide is selected from the group consisting of polyxyloglucan and polygaiactomannan.  For example, preferred polysaccharides<br>
30  are locust bean gum,- tamarind xyloglucan, guar gum or<br>
AMENDED SHEET                                                           09/07/2007 <br>

-   11   -<br>
mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the deposition aid is locust bean gum.<br>
The polysaccharide acts as a delivery aid/deposition agent 5  for the particle.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide backbone has only B-1,4 linkages.  Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the B-1,4 linkages, such as B-1,3 linkages.<br>
10  Thus, optionally some other linkages are present.<br>
Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).<br>
15<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are<br>
20  therefore not in themselves counted in determining the<br>
degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is present at levels of between 0.1% to 10% w/w by weight of the total amount of the 25  particle.<br>
The deposition aid, which is preferably a polysaccharide, is attached to the polymer particle (with or without shell). Attachment may be by means of a.covalent bond, entanglement 30  or strong adsorption, preferably by a covalent bond or entanglement and most preferably by means of a covalent<br><br>
WO 2007/062733<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/010715<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
bond.  By entanglement as used herein is meant that the deposition aid is adsorbed onto the particle as the polymerisation proceeds and the particle grows in sice, part of the adsorbed polysaccharide becomes buried within the interior of the particle.  Hence at the end of the polymerisation, part of the polysaccharide is entrapped and bound in the polymer matrix of the particle, whilst the remainder is free to extend into the aqueous phase.<br>
Ey strong adsorption as used herein is meant strong adsorption of the polysaccharide to the surface of the particle; such adsorption can, for example, occur due to hydrogen bonding, Van Der Waals or electrostatic attraction between the polysaccharide chains and the particle.<br>
The deposition aid is thus mainly attached to the particle surface and is not, to any significant extent, distributed throughout the internal bulk of the particle.  This is distinct from graft copolymers in which e.g. a polysaccharide may be grafted along the length of a polymer chain.  A particle which is formed from a graft copolymer would, therefore, contain polysaccharide throughout the internal bulk of the particle as well as on the particle surface and the present invention is not intended to cover such a particle.  Thus the particle which is produced when using a polysaccharide as the deposition aid according to the process of the invention can be thought of as a "hairy particle", which is different from a graft copolymer.  This feature of the invention provides significant cost reduction opportunities for the manufacturer as much less<br><br>

polysaccharide is required to achieve the same level of activity as systems which utilise polysaccharide copolymers.<br>
Other types of particle surface morphology may be produced 5  when a deposition aid is attached to the particle of the<br>
invention.  For example, where a polysaccharide attaches to the particle surface in multiple places, loops may result, or the deposition aid may be in the form of a swollen cationic polymer layer at the particle surface. 10<br>
The Shell<br>
The particles of the invention comprises a shell which is situated between the core and the deposition aid.  The 15  particle thus has core-shell morphology.  Like the core, the shell comprises monomer units which are derived from monomers that are capable of undergoing free radical polymerisation.  The shell comprises monomer units selected from b), and optionally c) and/or optionally d) as described 20  above.  The monomer units of the core may be the same as or different from the monomer units of the shell and both the core and the shell may comprise mixtures of monomer units. Like the core, the shell may optionally comprise monomers which are cross-linkers as described above.  The shell .25  preferably covers 50 to .100 % of the surface area of the core, most preferably 95 to 100 %.<br>
The ratio of core to shell by weight may be from 1:1 to 100:1, preferably 2:1 to 20:1.<br>

The polymer and perfume must be compatible, i.e. phase separation should not occur when the polymerisation of the monomer (which is mixed with the perfume) is carried out during the process of the invention.  The person skilled in 5  the art will be able to determine which are compatible by performing simple tests, for example, a simple test would be to carry out the polymerisation to form a late:-:, let a sample of the newly formed latex dry into a thin film and look for visual evidence of phase separation - if the film 10  is clear, they are compatible, if opaque they are<br>
incompatible.  Where an incompatibility exists, dilution of an incompatible polymer with a compatible one may improve its compatibility.<br>
15  Perfumes<br>
The polymer particle of the invention comprises a perfume. The perfume is present in an amount of from 1 to 50 % by total weight of the particle, preferably from 10 to 50 % by 20      total weight of the particle.<br>
The perfume suitably has a molecular weight of from 50 to 500.<br>
25  The perfume suitably has a boiling point of from 30 to 500 degrees Centrigrade.<br>
The perfume is not post-absorbed/adsorbed into/onto the particle, but instead is' incorporated into the particle as 30  the particle is formed.<br><br>

The polymer particle may be used in the treatment of fabric. The treatment provides a perfume benefit. 5<br>
Alternatively, the polymer particle may be incorporated into a laundry treatment composition and used in the treatment of fabric.<br>

Miniemulsions generally lie in between macroemulsion and microemulsions in terms of droplet size and emulsion stability.  Miniemulsion droplets typically range in size from 50 to 500 ran. 20<br>
The preferred "hybrid" process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) preparation of a miniemulsion (comprising monomers, a perfume and a cosurfactant), and 25  (b) polymerisation of the miniemulsion of step (a) to form miniemulsion core particles, and attachment of a deposition aid around the core particles.<br>
A core-shell particle may be prepared by using the hybrid 30  process as follows:<br><br>

5  (c) addition of shell monomers and initiator such that<br>
polymerisation occurs to form a shell around the core particles of step (b) and attachment of a deposition aid around the particles.<br>
10  Step (a) may consist of the following sub-steps:<br>
(i)    mixing monomers and perfume with a cosurfactant to<br>
form a mixture (y), (ii)   dissolving at least one surfactant in water to form a solution (z), 15  (iii)  combining (y) and (z) and subjecting to high shear to form a miniemulsion.<br>
Step (iii) may consist of the following sub-steps:<br>
(1)	(y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear<br>
20         to form an emulsion,<br>
(2)	the emulsion of step (1) is then subjected to further<br>
shear (such as sonication or other suitable high<br>

Alternatively, the surfactant of step (ii) may be a reactive surfactant, by which is meant that it comprises groups that may participate in the polymerisation and a hydrophilic group.  In this case it will be combined with the monomer in step (i) .<br>
The preferred "artificial." process comprises the steps of:<br>

(c)	addition of shell monomers and subsequent polymerisation to form a shell around the core particles of step (b), wherein attachirient of a deposition aid to the particles occurs in step (c).<br>
Step (a) may consist of the following sub-steps:<br>
(i)   dissolving polymer and a perfume with a cosurfactant<br>
in a water insoluble volatile solvent to form a<br>
mixture solution (m), (ii)  dissolving at least one surfactant in water to form a<br>

0  aobis (2-cyanopropane) and the formation of free radicals from bencophenone and benzoin.<br>
F.edox reactions can also be used to generate free radicals. In this case   an oxidising agent is paired "with a reducing 5  agent which then undergo a redox reaction.

A chain transfer agent contains very labile hydrogen atoms that are easily abstracted by a propagating polymer chain.  This terminates the polymerisation of the growing polymer, but generates a new reactive site on the chain transfer agent that can then proceed to initiate further polymerisation of the remaining monomer.  Chain transfer agents in the context of the invention typically contain thiol (mercaptan) functionality and can be represented by the general chemical formula P.S-H, such as n-dodecyl mercartan and 2-mercaptoethanol.

Preparation of the wash liquor:<br>
Ease Euffer Stock (12.5 ml) and surfactant stock (12.5 ml) were added to a 500ml Linitest pot and 100 ml de-ionised water was added to produce a wash liquor buffered at pH 10.5 5  and containing 1 g/L surfactant (50:50 LAS:A7).<br>
Simulated v/ash:<br>
0.3g of the above samples (equates to 0.002'g of perfume and 30ppm of perfume on wash liquor) were each added to the 10  linitest pots containing wash liquor and agitated slightly to ensure mixing.  (Washes were done in duplicate for each sample and results averaged).<br>
Linitest Equipment and Procedure 15  A section of unfluoresced cotton measuring 20 cm by 20 cm<br>
was placed into each linitest pot containing the wash liquor and polymer particles and the pot was sealed.<br>
The Linitest is a proprietary laboratory scale washing 20  machine (Ex. Heraeus).  The equipment is designed and built to comply with the requirements for international standard test specifications.  It is used for small scale detergency and stain removal testing particularly when low liquor to cloth ratios are required. 25<br>
There are various models of the Linitest commercially available.  The model used in this case has a single rotation speed of 4 0 rpm.  The carrier is capable of accommodating twelve 500ml steel containers and can be 30  operated at temperatures up to 100Â°C.<br><br>

General Principles:<br>
The Linitast comprises a 20 litre tank, control system and drive mechanism.  Permanant thermostatically controlled 5  tubular heating elements in the base of the tank heat the bath liquor to the required temperature.  The stainless steel construction throughout ensures efficient heat transfer to the specimen containers that are mounted on a rotating horizontal carrier driven by a geared motor.  The 10  rotating movement of the carrier 'throws' the liquid from one end of the container t: the other in a continuous action.  This movement simulates the mechanical washing process and additional mechanical action can be obtained by using steel ball bearings or discs.<br>

Wash Conditions:<br>
The linitest pots were attached to the Linitester cradle and rotated 45 minutes at 40Â°C to simulate the main wash. 20  The cloths were then removed and wrung by hand.<br>
Simulated Rinses:<br>
The linitest pots were then thoroughly rinsed and the 25  'wrung' cloths returned to the pots and 125ml of de-ionised water was added.  The linitester bath water was drained and the pots attached to the cradle and rotated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature (~20Â°C) to simulate a rinse procedure.  The clothes were then removed and wrung by hand. 30  This procedure was repeated a further two times to simulate<br><br>

Quantification of Perfume on Dried Fabrics 5<br>
Each cotton swatch was  cut into quarters (10xlOcm, 1.5g) and added to 15ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and agitated (Roller Mixer SF.T2, ex. Stuart Scientific) overnight (~15hrs) to extract the perfume from the cloth.(The analysis was.  done<br>
10  in duplicate and 2 swatches from each sample were assessed) . The level of perfume extracted from the fabric into the THF solvent was determined using a gas chromatogram v/ith mass spectrum detector (GC-MS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM).  A standard containing 30ppm of model perfume was ran<br>
15  at the start of the analysis prior to running all samples. The GC-MS settings follow:<br>

5  Calculation of Percentage Perfume Deposition<br>
If all perfume was deposited (0.003/4 = 0.00075g) and extracted from the quartered (10x10cm) cloth into the 15ml of TEF the concentration detected would be 50ppm.  The ratio<br>
10  of the sum of the 3 peaks for each sample to the peak area sum of the standard (x30) gave a measure of the level (in ppm) of the perfume that was deposited on the cloth.  The ratio of this value over the 50ppm maximum level that could be present (xl00) gave a measure of the percentage perfume<br>
15  deposited.<br>
The percentage perfume deposited for Comparative Example A and E, Example 2,   Comparative Example C,. Example 3, Comparative Example D and Example 4 are shown in Table 4. 20<br>
