Background and Prior Art:<br>
Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) technology has been receiving increasing attention. Supercritical fluid is a gas subjected to temperatures and pressures over limits of critical pressure and critical temperature. Supercritical fluid extraction is a unit operation that exploits the unique properties of solvents above their critical values to extract desired components from a mixture.<br>
Supercritical fluids (SF) offer very attractive characteristics owing to its favorable diffusivity, viscosity, surface tension and other physical properties.<br>
Various supercritical fluids like ethane, ethylene, propane, trichlorofluoro methane etc., have been used for supercritical fluid extraction. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most widely used SF as it is generally regarded as safe (GRAS), non-toxic, non-corrosive, and easily available at economic price. It has low critical temperature and pressure and also low latent heat of vaporization.<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
Sticky, non-porous and compact nature of waxes limits their application in supercritical fluid extraction of either one or more of its components.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for converting sticky, non-porous and compact physical form of wax into free flowing, non-sticky and porous spherules. The process comprises of dissolving wax in a solvent at higher temperature; adding inert adsorbent to the wax solution and loading wax onto adsorbent to form highly loaded spherules; forming a semi-solid mass by cooling the above mixture under stirring; removing residual solvent under vacuum and drying the highly loaded spherules. These highly loaded spherules have larger surface area for faster extraction; high porosity that helps in better diffusivity of supercritical fluid leading to efficient extraction; are non-sticky and free flowing that helps in better packaging of extraction device and easy cleaning of extraction device thus preventing cross contamination in successive experiments. The highly loaded spherules formed act as a feed for the supercritical fluid extraction of one or more components of wax having pharmaceutical, cosmoceutical, nutraceuticals, diagnostic and/or agricultural applications.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Over the past decade, several noteworthy consumer trends have emerged such as enhanced concern for the quality and safety of foods and medicines, regulation for nutritive and toxicity levels and increased preference for "natural" as opposed to synthetic substances. "Mother Nature" is considered a highly efficient synthesizer of desirable blends of constituents ideally suitable for human consumption. Safety of both producers and consumers is now a major requirement of any new product or process. Accordingly, compelling regulations on the usage of hazardous, carcinogenic and toxic solvents as well as high energy costs for solvent regeneration have curtailed the growth of natural extract industries. Alternative extraction methodologies that comply with both consumer preference and regulatory control and that are cost effective are becoming popular. One such major technology that has emerged over the last two decades as the alternative to the traditional solvent extraction of natural products is the Supercritical Fluid Extraction technique. The supercritical fluid extraction is a known process which is<br>
6<br><br>
Supercritical fluid extraction technology is thus gaining importance over the conventional techniques for extraction of natural products. Part of the reason for recent interest in the supercritical fluid extraction is that it offers a potential advantage of higher yield and better quality products. One particular application, where the process may prove to be useful, is for recovery of high value and low volume products. Waxes are one such group of example which contains many pharmaceutical, cosmoceutical, nutraceuticals, diagnostic and/or agriculturally important constituents.<br>
The term wax generally refers to a substance which is a plastic solid at room temperature and a liquid of low viscosity above its melting point. It is chemically defined as esters of fatty acid with fatty alcohols, having 36-50 carbon atoms.<br>
However, Supercritical fluid extraction technology has not been extended to waxes for extraction of their one or more components as they posed several mechanical and thermodynamic problems during extraction.<br>
1.	The inherent non-porous and compact nature of waxes does not make them an ideal candidate for supercritical fluid extraction of components of waxes, as waxes caused thermodynamic problems during supercritical fluid extraction. Their non-porous and compact nature hampers the diffusivity of supercritical fluid leading to inefficient extraction. Also lesser surface area is exposed to supercritical fluid to extract wax component(s).<br>
2.	Another limitation of waxes is their sticky nature that results in clogging of the tubing connected to the extraction vessel. The internal diameter of tubing being as small as that of 1/16th of an inch, it led to the blocking the flow of supercritical fluid, making the supercritical fluid extraction instrument inoperable.<br>
3.	At high pressure waxes adhered strongly to the metal surface of extraction vessel making it very difficult for cleaning. Traces of wax, which could not be removed during cleaning, led to contamination in the successive batches.<br>
8<br><br>
The present invention is focused on changing the sticky, non-porous and compact physical form of wax into a free flowing, non-sticky, porous spherules, to extract any component of wax from any wax.<br>
As used herein the term "wax" refers to any wax which is synthetic (such as modified wax, compound wax etc.) or of natural origin (animal wax, insect wax, mineral wax, vegetable wax, etc.). The term wax generally refers to a substance which is a plastic solid at room temperature and a liquid of low viscosity above its melting point. It is chemically defined as esters of fatty acid with higher fatty alcohols.<br>
As used herein the term "adsorbent" refers, e.g., to kaolin, aluminum hydroxide, zeolites, activated carbon, hydrophobic starch, molecular sieves, fuller"s earth, bentonite, hectorite, silicon dioxide gel, silica, colloidal magnesium-aluminum silicate, activated alumina, magnesium tri silicate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and the like.<br>
As used herein the term "highly loaded spherules" refers to a loading of the adsorbent with the wax. The percentage loading should be less than 1000%. Preferably the percentage loading should be less than 500%. Most preferably the percentage loading should be less than 200%. These highly loaded spherules are free flowing, non-sticky and porous spherules.<br>
As used herein the term "conditions of adsorption" does not refer to fixed conditions. The conditions depend on the kind of wax and the desired loading of the adsorbent.<br>
As used herein the term "wax component(s)" refers to one or more constituents of wax to be extracted such as, but not limited to, vitamin A, D, E or K, carotenoids, fatty alcohols, hydroxy aromatic acids, saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, squalene, sterols, oryzanols etc.<br>
9<br><br>
As used herein the term "supercritical fluid" refers to carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, n-butane, acetone, chlorotrifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, nitrous oxide, ammonia, benzene, toluene and mixtures thereof.<br>
As used herein the term "extraction conditions" does not refer to fixed conditions. The conditions of extraction depend on the kind of wax, supercritical fluid used and the component of wax to be extracted. Extraction pressure and extraction temperature must have a value above the critical pressure and critical, temperature respectively, or at least in the near critical region.<br>
The process for preparing highly loaded spherules is as follows<br>
A supersaturated solution of wax in a solvent is prepared at temperature where the clear solution is formed. Inert adsorbent is added to the above solution. The resultant mixture is allowed to cool under stirring conditions. Residual solvent is removed by vacuum drying to obtain highly loaded spherules.<br>
Highly loaded spherules are inert adsorbents loaded with wax in such a fashion that they inherit favorable physical characters such as free flowing, non-sticky and porous so that they can be subjected to supercritical fluid extraction of one or more component of wax. Wax is treated with inert adsorbents in presence of a solvent to obtain highly loaded spherules.<br>
The conditions of formation of highly loaded spherules cannot be fixed. These conditions may vary depending upon the nature of wax and nature of adsorbent.<br>
The solvent that can be used, for the preparation of highly loaded spherules, in the present invention are low molecular weight alkanes such as hexane, heptane, petroleum fractions; alkyl halides such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloro methylene; ether such as di ethyl ether, petroleum ether; ketone such as acetone; aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, pyridine; esters such as ethyl acetate; alcohol<br>
10<br><br>
(primary, secondary or tertiary) such as ethanol, methanol, propanol, iso-propanol,<br>
butanol, iso-butanol etc.<br>
Preferred solvents are those in which wax shows intermediate solubility. Most preferred<br>
solvents are that exhibiting temperature dependent solubility for wax. The solubility of<br>
wax in solvent should increase with increase with temperature and vice-versa. Most<br>
preferred solvents are those which give a clear solution with wax at higher temperature<br>
and on cooling precipitate the wax in the form of small fluffy particles.<br>
Also the solvent should be such that the adsorbent should be insoluble in solvent.<br>
The temperature range required for the formation of highly loaded spherules would depend upon the wax component(s) to be extracted. At the maximum limit of temperature, the wax component(s) to be extracted should not degrade.<br>
The experiment for the formation of highly loaded spherules is carried out under stirring conditions of more than 10 RPM, preferably more than 100 RPM.<br>
The particle size and loading of adsorbent determines the free flowing and non-sticky nature of highly loaded spherules.<br><br>
Not more than 10% of particles should pass through 400 # sieve. Preferably not more than 10% of particles should pass through 200 # sieve. Most preferably not more than 10% of particles should pass through 100 # sieve.<br>
The percentage loading of wax onto adsorbents to yield highly loaded spherules is calculated by the following formula:<br>
(Weight of spherules - Weight of adsorbent)   X   100<br>
Percentage Loading     =   	<br>
Weight of adsorbent<br>
Weight of spherules is the weight of wax loaded onto adsorbents and the weight of adsorbents. The percentage loading should be less than 1000%. Preferably the percentage<br>
11<br><br>
loading should be less than 500%. Most preferably the percentage loading should be less than 200%.<br>
Highly loaded spherules, thus formed, will act as a feed for the extraction of one or more constituents/components of wax, having one or more pharmaceutical, cosmoceutical, nutraceuticals, diagnostic and/or agricultural applications, using supercritical fluid extraction technology.<br>
Highly loaded spherules are subjected to different conditions of extraction pressure, extraction temperature, flow rate of supercritical fluid etc., in order to extract the desired wax component(s) from highly loaded spherules.<br>
When the feed is in the form of a solid, the supercritical fluid extraction process is carried out from a fixed bed of solids with a continuous flow of supercritical fluid. Alternatively moving solid bed can also be used but they are difficult to handle continuously in pressurized vessels. For extraction from fixed bed of solid particles loaded in a batch extractor, the supercritical fluid solvent is continuously passed through the extractor and evenly, either in the downward or upward direction with a fixed flow rate of supercritical fluid. The pressure and temperature are of the extractor are maintained constant and these parameters should be decided such that the supercritical fluid has sufficient solvent capacity for the wax component(s) to be extracted. The wax component(s) must be readily transported from the highly loaded spherules to the bulk of supercritical fluid<br>
When highly loaded spherules are in contact with supercritical fluid at selected supercritical conditions, the extraction of wax component(s) takes place in the following sequential and parallel steps:<br>
1.	Diffusion of supercritical fluid into the pores and adsorption of supercritical fluid on the solid surface of highly loaded spherules<br>
2.	Transport of wax component(s)to the outer layer and formation of a thin liquid film around the highly loaded spherules<br>
3.	Dissolution of wax component(s) in supercritical fluid<br>
4.	Convective transport of the wax component(s) to the bulk of supercritical fluid<br>
12<br><br>
The process for extraction of wax component(s) will now be set forth in great detail with reference to figure 1, showing schematically supercritical fluid extraction equipment. The four primary steps involved are extraction, expansion, separation and solvent conditioning, and the four corresponding critical components needed are a high pressure extractor (1), a pressure reduction valve (2), a low pressure separator (3) and a pump (4) for intensifying the pressure of the recycled solvent<br>
The process starts by feeding the highly loaded spherules into the extraction device (1). The supercritical fluid, at pressure above critical pressure and temperature above critical temperature of supercritical fluid, is fed into the extraction device (1). Depending upon the extraction pressure, extraction temperature and flow rate of supercritical fluid the wax component(s) is dissolved and extracted, thereby obtaining supercritical fluid loaded with the wax component(s).<br>
The loaded supercritical fluid is then expanded in a separator (3) by passing through pressure reduction valve (2) to a pressure where the solubilisation capacity of the supercritical fluid is reduced to obtain a reduced supercritical fluid and wax component(s). The pressure reduction depends on the applied supercritical fluid and on the extraction conditions. The appropriate reduction of pressure can be determined by phase equilibria measurements. At reduced pressure and temperature conditions, the wax component(s) precipitates in a separator (3). The separated wax component(s) is collected from separator (3) and may be further processed for purification to obtain wax component(s) with high purity. Alternatively, the supercritical fluid may be recycled to the extractor via a pump (4). Because of the pressure drop, the temperature is also reduced. Therefore the recycled in-loading supercritical fluid is passed through the heater (5) before it is fed again to the extraction device (1).<br>
Thus the present invention comprises of a process of supercritical fluid extraction of one<br>
or more component from wax by<br>
1.      Dissolving wax in a solvent at higher temperature;<br>
13<br><br>
2.	Adding inert adsorbent to the wax solution and loading wax onto adsorbent to form highly loaded spherules;<br>

4.	Removing residual solvent under vacuum and drying the highly loaded spherules;<br>
5.	Feeding the highly loaded spherules to the extraction device of supercritical fluid extraction unit;<br>
6.	Packing the extraction device with silica and glass wool;<br>
7.	Adjusting  solvent capacity  of supercritical  fluid  by  adjusting  the  extraction pressure, extraction temperature and flow rate of supercritical fluid;<br>
8.	Passing supercritical fluid over the bed of highly loaded spherules;<br>

10.	Expanding supercritical fluid loaded with wax component(s);<br>

Highly loaded spherules prepared using adsorbent of particle size of 20-100 # mesh sieve were more spherical as compared to the spherules prepared using 100-200# or 200-400# mesh sieve.<br>
The spherules prepared using adsorbent of particle size of 20-100 # mesh showed better flow properties, like flow rate, angle of repose, when compared to spherules prepared using 100-200# or 200-400# mesh sieve.<br>

No difference was observed when adherence to metal surface was considered.<br>
Example 3<br>
Optimization of percentage loading of highly loaded spherules used in example 1 Highly loaded spherules were prepared with different percentage loading of wax (less than 200%). They were assessed on the basis of spherecity, flow properties and adherence time to metal surface. The effect of percentage loading of highly loaded spherules on various parameters was as follows:<br><br>
PARAMFTFRS		Percentage	Loading	<br>
	Wax	200%	100%	66.66%	50%<br>
Flow Time (gm/sec)	*	*	*	10- 15	10-15<br>
Angle of Repose (°)	*	*	*	20-30	20-30<br>
Sphericity	#	#	65-75	75-85	85-95<br>
Adherence Time on Metal Surface (sec)	14	4	
*	Poor flow<br>
#	Semi solid mass, no spherules were formed<br>
Based on flow properties, sphericity and adherence time on metal surface, percentage loading of less than 100% gave better result.<br>
For a particular adsorbent selected, flow properties, sphericity and adherence time to metal surface was improved, as the percentage loading of highly loaded spherules was decreased. It should also be considered that as the percentage loading is decreased the feed sample weight will increase. However an optimum percentage loading should be considered which gives satisfactory results with the added advantage of low feed sample weight.<br>

Example 4<br>
Supercritical fluid extraction of vitamin E from oilseed wax<br>
The extraction of vitamin E from oilseed wax was carried out by forming highly loaded<br>
spherules of wax using inert adsorbent, silica. The percentage loading of highly loaded<br>
spherules was less the 200%. The particle size of adsorbent was such that not more than<br>
10% of the particles were passed through 100#. The said highly loaded spherules formed<br>
were fed into the extraction device of supercritical fluid extraction unit. Carbon dioxide<br>
was used as a supercritical fluid. Vitamin E was extracted at extraction pressure ranging<br>
from 100 to 550 bar, extraction temperature ranging from 35 to 80 °C and flow rate of<br>
supercritical fluid ranging from 0.1  to 0.8 L/min. Vitamin E extracted using this<br>
technology was five times more than conventional extraction<br>
Example 5<br>
Extraction of pure vitamin E in one single step<br>
The purity of the wax component(s) being extracted by supercritical fluid extraction<br>
technology decreases as the values of extraction conditions increases, whereby its yield<br>
increases. 100%o pure natural vitamin E was obtained at extraction pressure ranging from<br>
100 to 300 bar, extraction temperature of 40 to 60 °C, flow rate of supercritical fluid of<br>
0.1 to 0.3 L/min.<br>
Description of drawings:<br>
Figure 1, shows supercritical fluid extraction equipment. The process starts with feeding the highly loaded spherules followed by the supercritical fluid, at pressure above critical pressure and temperature above critical temperature of supercritical fluid, is fed into the extraction device (1). Depending upon the extraction pressure, extraction temperature and flow rate of supercritical fluid, the wax component(s) is dissolved and extracted, thereby obtaining supercritical fluid loaded with the wax component(s).<br>
The loaded supercritical fluid is then expanded in a separator (3) by passing through pressure reduction valve (2) to a pressure where the solubilisation capacity of the supercritical fluid is reduced to obtain a reduced supercritical fluid and wax component(s). At reduced pressure and temperature conditions, the wax component(s)<br>
18<br><br>
precipitates in a separator (3). The separated wax components) is collected from separator (3) and may be further processed for purification to obtain wax component(s) with high purity. Alternatively, the supercritical fluid may be recycled to the extractor via a pump (4). Because of the pressure drop, the temperature is also reduced. Therefore the recycled in-loading supercritical fluid is passed through the heater (5) before it is fed again to the extraction device (1).<br>
