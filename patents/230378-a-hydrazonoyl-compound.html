COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL INTERMEDIATES USEFUL FOR PREPARING ARYLTRIAZOLINONES"<br>
FMC CORPORATION, of 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
WO 01/27092	PCT/US00/28240<br>
1<br>
PROCESS TO PREPARE ARYLTRIAZOLINONES AND NOVEL INTERMEDIATES THERETO<br>
This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional  Application No. <br>
5     60/159,247, filed October 13,1999.<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of process chemistry as<br>
used in the preparation of commercially valuable chemical products. In particular,<br>
H pertains to processes related to l-aryltriazolinone ring formation and to novel<br>
intermediates useful in these processes.<br>
10	The    compound   4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-l -phenyl-1,2,4-triazol-5(IH)-one,<br>
            among others, is a particularly useful l-aryltriazolinone critical in the manufacture<br>
            of commercially important herbicides.   For example, US Patents 4,818,275 and<br>
             5,125,958 fully describe conversions of l-aryltriazolinone intermediates to known<br>
               herbicides.<br>
15	Some known methods for the preparation of 1-aryltriazolinones require<br>
formation of a 1-aryltriazolidinone ring followed by conversion of the 1-aryltriazolidinone ring to the desired 1-aryltriazoiinone. This requirement is disadvantageous because it adds an additional step to the process of preparing 1-aryltriazolinones. Other known methods provide less than optimum yields of 1 <br>
20	 aryltriazolinone because of by-product formation. Given the commercial value of 1-aryltriazolinones, improved processes for their preparation are therefore needed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
r<br>
It has now been found that commercially useful 1-aryltriazolinones of<br>
25	formula I<br><br>
WO 01/27092	PCT/USOO/28240<br>

is halogen or -NHR where R is hydrogen or haloalkyl; X and Y are independently selected from hydrogen, chloro, or fluoro; 2 is hydrogen, bromo, iodo, nitro, amino, or methylsulfonylamino; and R1 is methyl. Additionally, certain compounds of formula (A) used to prepare 1-aryltriazolinones of formula I are also <br>
15 	novel and are included among the preferred embodiments of the present invention. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.<br>

Preferably, the carbonylation of an amidrazone of formula (A) to form a compound of formula I is conducted in the presence of an acid or base catalyst. The catalyst need not be present in order to form a compound of formula I; however, its presence will generally accelerate the formation of a compound of <br>
5	 formula I. Whether or not a catalyst is preferably present may depend upon the compound of formula I being formed, the amidrazone (A) being used as the reactant, the catalyst, the desired reaction time, and the reaction temperature, which one of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine based on general knowledged and this disclosure.<br>

20     as catalysts.<br>
Useful base catalysts also include alkali metal alkoxides, such as, without limitation, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert.-butoxide, and other alkali metal alkoxides known in the art.

The base catalyst used in the present invention can be present in a mole <br>
5  	   ratio of base catalyst to amidrazone (A) in a range of about 0.0001/1 to about 1/1, preferably in a range of about 0.001/1 to about 0.1/1. Additional amounts of base catalyst may be added if necessary to drive the reaction faster, for example.<br>
The temperature at which and the period for which a chemical reaction such as the carbonylation of amidrazone (A) is conducted will vary according to, among<br>
10	 other things, the solvent or solvents in which the reaction is conducted, the reaction format (e.g., batch, semi-batch, or continuous), the carbonylating agent, and/or the formula of amidrazone (A), and whether or not a catalyst is used. The carbonylation of amidrazone (A) as set forth herein is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of about 10° C to about 200° C for a period of time of up<br>
15	 to about 20 hours, preferably in the range of about ambient temperature to about 160° C for about 10 hours, and more preferably up to about 5 hours.<br>
Generally, in a process of carbonylating an amidrazone (A), a hydrazine derivative, for example, 2,4-dichlorophenyihydrazine (1) is first prepared from its hydrochloride salt by treating the salt with a base, such as aqueous sodium<br>
20 hydroxide, giving the free hydrazine (1). The free hydrazine (1) is in turn reacted with, for example, ethyl acetimidate at a temperature of about 0° C to about ambient temperature in an appropriate solvent such as methylene chloride, yielding the corresponding amidrazone (A), 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazidethaneimidic acid. Amidrazone (A) is in turn carbonylated with, for example, diphenyl carbonate at a<br>
25 temperature of about 100° C to about 115° C in a appropriate solvent such as<br>

amidrazone (A) to yield a compound of formula (ij is set forth in Example 3 hereinbelow.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, the process for preparing a compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
involves a condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) with at least one ring-forming agent, where formula (A) is: <br>
10<br><br>
and wherein X and Y are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, nitro, <br>
15     and amino; Z is selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, amino, or<br>
alkylsulfonylamino; W is halogen, -NCO, -OS02CH3, -OS02CF3, or<br>
-OS02(p-CH3Ph); and R"js hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, acetyl, or aryl.<br>
Preferred species of hydrazonoyl derivative (A) with which to conduct the<br>
condensation reaction of the present invention are selected from those wherein W <br>
20      is halogen; X and Y are independently selected from hydrogen, chloro, or fluoro; Z<br>
is hydrogen, bromo, iodo, nitro, amino, or methylsulfonylamino; and Rl is Ct to<br>
CI2 alkyl.<br>
More preferred species of hydrazonoyl derivative (A) are selected from<br>
those wherein W is chloro; X and Y are hydrogen; Z is hydrogen, 5-nitro, or 5-<br><br>
WO 01/27092	PCT/US00/28240<br>
12<br>
amino; and R is methyl, ethyl, or propyl; wherein W is chloro; X is hydrogen; Y<br>
is 4-chloro; Z is hydrogen or 5-nitro; and R1 is methyl, ethyl, or propyl; wherein W is chloro; X is 2-chloro or 2-fluoro; Y and 2 are hydrogen; and R1 is methyl, ethyl, or propyl; or wherein W is chloro: X is 2-chloro or 2-fluoro, Y is 4-chloro; Z is <br>
5     	hydrogen 5-bromo, 5-iodo, or 5-nitro; and R1 is methyl, ethyl, or propyl.<br>
Most preferred species of hydrazonoyl derivative (A) are selected from those wherein W is chloro; X, Y, and Z are hydrogen; and R! is methyl, or wherein W is chloro; X is 2-fluoro; Y is 4-chloro, Z is hydrogen, and Rl is methyl.<br>
For conducting the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
10 formula (A), at least one organic solvent, such as those described above, is preferably employed. Preferred organic solvents are those that are low cost, best enhance the solubility of the starting materials to promote rate of reaction, and offer minimum solvent decomposition. Accordingly, preferred organic solvents include glymes, DMF, DMAC, l-methyl-2-pyrro!idinone, and methyl sulfoxide.<br>
15 More preferred solvents are glymes, DMF, and DMAC. Particularly preferred solvents are DMAC and diglyme. A useful ratio of solvent to hydrozonoyl derivative (A) to afford optimum reaction conditions is in the range of about 2.5/1 to about 20/1 wt/wt, preferably about 3/1 to about 15/1,<br>
Accordingly, when diglyme is the solvent of choice in which to conduct the<br>
20 condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A), the rate of reaction benefits from the inclusion of a reaction rate-promoting amount of water. Inasmuch as the reaction proceeds in an acceptable manner without the presence of water, it is believed that it aids in dissolving the ring-forming agent thereby enhancing its contact with hydrazonoyl derivative (A) causing the reaction to<br>
25 proceed at a faster rate. The ratio of reaction rate-promoting amount of water to solvent as used in the present invention is in the range of about 0.001/1 to about 1/1 wt/wt. A preferred ratio is about 0.01/1 to about 0.9/1, more preferably about 0.04/1 to about 0.8/1.<br>
In order to form a compound of formula I, a hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
30     formula (A) is condensed with at least one ring-forming agent.    Useful ring-<br>

forming agents in the process of the present invention include, for example, such as, without limitation sodium cyanate, potasium cyanate, silver cyanate, methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate, phenyl carbamate, cyanic acid, isocyanic acid, acetyl isocyanate, and trimethylsilyl isocyanate. Preferred ring-forming agents are<br>
5	 sodium cyanate, potassium cyanate, cyanic acid, isocyanic acid, and phenyl carbamate. More preferred ring-forming agents are sodium cyanate and potassium cyanate, particularly potassium cyanate. A useful mole ratio of ring-forming agent to hydrazonoyl derivative (A) of about 1/1 to about 5/1, preferably about 1.05/1 to about 2/1, and more preferably about 1.1/1 to about 1.3/1.<br>
10	Preferably, the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
formula (A) to form a compound of formula I is conducted in the presence of a catalyst. Accordingly, useful catalysts, such as those described sbove, for condensing hydrazonoyl derivative (A) include potassium iodide, potassium fluoride, silver bromide, silver iodide, and elemental iodine. Preferred catalysts are<br>
15 potassium iodide, potassium fluoride, and elemental iodine, particularly potassium fluoride. The catalyst used in the present invention can be present in a mole ratio of catalyst to hydrazonoyl derivative (A) in a range of about 0.001/1 to about 0.1/1, preferably about 0.004/1 to about 0.06/1. Additional amounts of catalyst may be added if necessary to drive the reaction faster, for example.<br>
20	The temperature at which and the period for which a chemical reaction such<br>
as the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) is conducted will vary, as discussed above. The condensing of hydrazonoyl derivative (A) as set forth herein is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of about -10° C .to~5bout 160° C for a period of time up to about 30 hours,<br>
25 preferably in the range of about 0° C to about 100° C for up to about 20 hours, more preferably up to about 10 hours.<br>
Generally in a process of condensing a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) to form a compound of formula (I), the free hydrazine (1) as described above, for example, 2,4-dichlorophenyihydrazine (1) is reacted with acetic anhydride at a<br>
30     temperature of about 10° C in an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate, yielding<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26<br><br>
WO 01/27092<br><br>
PCT/US00/28240<br><br>

the corresponding l-acetyl-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazine (2). The hydrazine (2)<br>
is then chlorinated with phosphorous oxychloride at a temperature of about 110° C<br>
in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, yielding the hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
formula (A), N-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethanehydrozonoyl chloride. The hydrozonoyl<br>
5     chloride (A) is condensed with a ring forming agent, for example, potassium<br>
cyanate at a temperature of about 40° C to about 65° C in an appropriate solvent<br>
such as DMAC, yielding the corresponding compound of formula (I), 45-dihydro-<br>
1 -(2,4-dichlorophenyI)-3-methyl-1,2,4-triazol-5(IH&gt;one.      The   condensing   of<br>
hydrozonoyl chloride (A) to the compound of formula (I) in solvents such as<br>
10     DMAC is routinely aided by the presence of a catalyst, such as potassium fluoride.<br>
A detailed procedure for the preparation, and the potassium fluoride-catalized<br>
condensing of the hydrozoniyl chloride (A) with the ring forming agent potassium<br>
cyanate in DMAC to yield a compound of formula (I) is set forth in Example 1<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
15	In a variation of the process of condensing a hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
formula (A) to form a compound of formula (I), the hyrazonoyl derivative (A), for example, N-(2,4-dichlorophenyI)ethanchydrozonoyl chloride is conducted at ambient temperature in the solvent diglyme in the presence of a catalytic amount of water. A detailed procedure for the preparation, and the water-catalized <br>
20 	condensing of the hydrozonoyl chloride (A) with the ring forming agent potassium cyanate in diglyme to yield a compound of formula (I) is set forth in Example 2 hereinbelow.<br>
