				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ACTIVE MATRIX SUBSTRATE, DISPLAY DEVICE,<br>
METHOD FOR INSPECTING THE ACTIVE MATRIX SUBSTRATE, AND METHOD<br>
5	FOR INSPECTING THE DISPLAY DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001 ] The present invention relates to an active matrix substrate having two or more<br>
layers, with a plurality of first extraction wirings respectively connecting a plurality of<br>
10 first wirings formed parallel to each other in a display region and a plurality of first<br>
terminals arranged in a terminal arrangement region being formed on the respective<br>
layers, a display device, a method for inspecting the active matrix substrate, and a method<br>
for inspecting the display device.<br>
15 Background Art<br>
[0002 ] In recent years, liquid crystal panels have been widely used in a variety of<br>
electronic devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, car navigation systems and personal<br>
computers. Liquid crystal panels are characterized by being thin, lightweight and power<br>
efficient. As for methods of mounting drivers on such liquid crystal panels, a so-called<br>
20 COG (Chip On Glass) method that involves directly mounting a driver on one (active<br>
matrix substrate) of a pair of substrates opposing each other across a liquid crystal<br>
material is known (e.g., see JP 9-329796A, JP 8-328033A). using this COG method<br>
enables liquid crystal panels to be made thinner, smaller and lighter, and with higher<br>
definition between wirings and terminals.<br>
25 [0003 ] Also, the vertical and horizontal pixel count of the display screens of liquid<br>
crystal panels used in compact electronic devices such as mobile phones and PDAs has<br>
trans1tioned in recent years from 160 x 120 QQVGA and 176x 144 QCIF to 320 x 240<br>
QVGA and even 640 x 480 VGA. This has lead to an increase in the number of wirings<br>
and terminals that ought to be formed on an active matrix substrate constituting a liquid<br>
30 crystal panel. However, in order to address the demand for more compact and higher<br>
definition liquid crystal panels, the s1ze of the active matrix substrate cannot be increased.<br>
[0004 ] In view of this, an active matrix substrate on which a plurality of extraction<br>
 <br>
wirings respectively connecting a plurality of gate wirings formed in a display region and<br>
a plurality of gate terminals arranged in a terminal arrangement region are formed on two<br>
or more layers (multi-layers) is known (e.g., see JP 2004-53 702A, JP 2005-91962A).<br>
Specifically, a prescribed number of the plurality of extraction wirings are formed on the<br>
5 same layer (first layer) as the layer on which the gate wirings are formed, and the<br>
remaining extraction wirings are formed on a different layer (second layer) from the layer<br>
on which the gate wirings are formed. Note that an insulating material is interposed<br>
between the extraction wirings formed on the first layer and the extraction wirings formed<br>
on the second layer. Multi-layering the extraction wirings enables a more compact and<br>
10 higher definition liquid crystal panel to be realized without increas1ng the s1ze of the<br>
active matrix substrate, s1nce the spacing between the extraction wirings formed on the<br>
first layer and the extraction wirings formed on the second layer can be reduced.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
15 Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0005 ] Incidentally, because an insulating material is interposed between the extraction<br>
wirings formed on the first layer and the extraction wirings formed on the second layer,<br>
short circuits (leakage) are unlikely to occur between the extraction wirings formed on the<br>
first layer and the extraction wirings formed on the second layer. However, short circuits<br>
20 can occur between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer, caused by dust<br>
in the photolithography process, etching res1due or the like during manufacture of the<br>
active matrix substrate. In particular, in recent years, more compact and higher definition<br>
liquid crystal panels have been des1red, as discussed above, increas1ng the likelihood of<br>
short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer, s1nce the<br>
25 spacing between wirings has been increas1ngly reduced in recent years. The importance<br>
of inspecting for short circuits between extraction wirings in the inspection process during<br>
manufacture or the like of active matrix substrates has thus increased. That is, in the<br>
mounting process, mounting a driver on a defective active matrix substrate in which a<br>
wiring short circuit has occurred results in a loss of material costs and operating costs.<br>
30[0006 ] However, despite the increas1ng importance of inspecting for short circuits<br>
between extraction wirings, a mechanism for detecting short circuits between adjacent<br>
extraction wirings formed on the same layer in relation to each of a plurality of layers in<br>
 <br>
an active matrix substrate having two or more layers has not been established.<br>
Specifically, with a conventional active matrix substrate having two or more layers, the<br>
same inspection signal is input from the same inspection wiring to each of adjacent<br>
extraction wirings formed on the same layer, so while disconnection of extraction wirings<br>
5 can detected, short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer<br>
cannot be detected.<br>
[0007 ] The present invention has been made in consideration of the above problems,<br>
and has as its object to provide an active matrix substrate, a display device, a method for<br>
inspecting the active matrix substrate and a method for inspecting the display device that<br>
10 enable short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer to be<br>
reliably detected in the case where extraction wirings are formed on each of a plurality of<br>
layers.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
15 [0008 ] In order to attain the above object, an active matrix substrate in the present<br>
invention includes a plurality of first wirings formed parallel to each other in a display<br>
region, a plurality of second wirings formed parallel to each other and so as to intersect<br>
the plurality of first wirings in the display region, a plurality of first terminals arranged in<br>
a terminal arrangement region, a plurality of second terminals arranged in the terminal<br>
20 arrangement region, a plurality of first extraction wirings respectively connecting the<br>
plurality of first wirings and the plurality of first terminals, and a plurality of second<br>
extraction wirings respectively connecting the plurality of second wirings and me<br>
plurality of second terminals. The plurality of first extraction wirings include a plurality<br>
of third extraction wirings and a plurality of fourth extraction wirings, the third extraction<br>
25 wirings being formed on the same layer as the layer on which the first wirings are formed,<br>
at least a portion of the fourth wirings being formed on a different layer from the layer on<br>
which the first wirings are formed with an insulating material sandwiched therebetween,<br>
and the third extraction wirings and the fourth extraction wirings being formed alternately<br>
per wiring in a peripheral wiring region that is other than the display region and the<br>
30 terminal arrangement region, and the active matrix substrate includes a plurality of first<br>
connecting wirings respectively connected to a plurality of first terminals to which the<br>
plurality of third extraction wirings are respectively connected, a plurality of second<br>
 <br>
connecting wirings respectively connected to a plurality of first terminals to which the<br>
plurality of fourth extraction wirings are respectively connected, a plurality of bundled<br>
wirings each composed of a mutually adjacent first connecting wiring and second<br>
connecting wiring bundled together, a first common wiring commonly connecting<br>
5 bundled wirings that are not adjacent to each other among the plurality of bundled<br>
wirings, and a second common wiring commonly connecting bundled wirings that are not<br>
adjacent to each other and not connected to the first common wiring among the plurality<br>
of bundled wirings.<br>
[0009 ] According to the active matrix substrate of the present invention, inspection<br>
10 signals can be input to the third extraction wirings and the fourth extraction wirings via<br>
the bundled wirings, the first connecting wirings and the second connecting wirings by<br>
inputting mutually independent inspection signals to the first common wiring and the<br>
second common wiring, in an inspection process during manufacture or the like of the<br>
active matrix substrate. That is, mutually independent inspection signals can be input to<br>
15 adjacent third extraction wirings. Note that the third extraction wirings are formed on the<br>
same layer as the layer on which the first wirings are formed. Short circuits between<br>
adjacent third extraction wirings can thereby be detected. Mutually independent<br>
inspection signals can also be input to adjacent fourth extraction wirings. Note that at<br>
least a portion of the fourth extraction wirings is formed on a different layer from the<br>
20 layer on which the first wirings are formed with an insulating material sandwiched<br>
therebetween. Short circuits between adjacent fourth extraction wirings can thereby be<br>
detected.<br>
[0010 ] The active matrix substrate of the present invention is provided with a plurality<br>
of bundled wirings each composed of a mutually adjacent first connecting wiring and<br>
25 second connecting wiring bundled together, with each of the plurality of bundled wirings<br>
being connected to the first common wiring or the second common wiring. The space<br>
between wirings can thus be widened and the number of wiring-layer connecting portions<br>
for electrically connecting wirings formed on different layers can be reduced, in<br>
comparison with a mode in which each of the plurality of first connecting wirings and the<br>
30 plurality of second connecting wirings are directly connected to the first common wiring<br>
or the second common wiring without providing bundled wirings. That is, short circuits<br>
between wirings are unlikely to occur because the spacing between wirings (between<br>
 <br>
bundled wirings) can be widened. Also, connection failures and the like in the wiring-<br>
layer connecting portions can be reduced because of being able to reduce the number of<br>
wiring-layer connecting portions.<br>
[0011 ] As a result, in the case where extraction wirings are formed on each of a plurality<br>
5 of layers, short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer can<br>
be reliably detected with a simple configuration.<br>
[0012 ] In order to attain the above object, a display device in the present invention is<br>
provided with an active matrix substrate according to the present invention. Note that the<br>
display device preferably is a liquid crystal display device.<br>
10[0013] In order to attain the above object, a method for inspecting an active matrix<br>
substrate or a display device in the present invention is a method for inspecting the above<br>
active matrix substrate or a display device provided with the above active matrix substrate<br>
including a process of inspecting the third extraction wirings and the fourth extraction<br>
wirings by inputting mutually independent inspection signals to the first common wiring<br>
15 and the second common wiring, and a process of cutting off the plurality of first<br>
connecting wirings and the plurality of second connecting wirings after the inspection<br>
step.<br>
[0014 ] According to the method for inspecting an active matrix substrate or a display<br>
device of the present invention, short circuits between adjacent third extraction wirings<br>
20and short circuits between adjacent fourth extraction wirings can be detected, by inputting<br>
mutually independent inspection signals to the first common wiring and the second<br>
common wiring. The plurality of first connecting wirings and the plurality of second<br>
connecting wirings are then cut off in the cutting off process. The plurality of first<br>
terminals to which the plurality of third extraction wirings are respectively connected are<br>
25 thereby electrically separated from the plurality of first terminals to which the plurality of<br>
fourth extraction wirings are respectively connected.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0015 ] As described above, an active matrix substrate, a display device and a method<br>
30 for inspecting the active matrix substrate of the present invention accomplish the effect of<br>
enabling short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer to<br>
be reliably detected with a simple configuration in the case where extraction wirings are<br>
 <br>
formed on each of a plurality of layers.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
15 [0017 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
which the plurality of first connecting wirings and the plurality of second connecting<br>
wirings are cut off, such that electrical continuity is not established between the plurality<br>
of first terminals to which the plurality of third extraction wirings are respectively<br>
connected and the plurality of first terminals to which the plurality of fourth extraction<br>
20 wirings are respectively connected. This mode results in the plurality of first terminals to<br>
which the plurality of third extraction wirings are respectively connected being<br>
electrically separated from the plurality of first terminals to which the plurality of fourth<br>
extraction wirings are respectively connected.<br>
[0018 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
25 which a resistanceelement is connected to at least one of a mutually adjacent first<br>
connecting wiring and second connecting wiring. In particular, a mode preferably is<br>
adopted in which a resistanceelement is connected to each of the mutually adjacent first<br>
connecting wiring and second connecting wiring. This mode enables the bundled wirings<br>
to be cut off instead of the first connecting wirings and the second connecting wirings in a<br>
30 cutting off process during manufacture or the like of the active matrix substrate. In other<br>
words, the number of wirings to be cut off is fewer than in the case of cutting off the first<br>
connecting wirings and the second connecting wirings. As a result, the time taken in the<br>
 <br>
cutting off process can be reduced. Also, the space between wirings to be cut off can be<br>
widened, enabling a reduction in the occurrence of failures such as adjacent wirings short<br>
circuiting due to cut-off debris produced during cutting off.<br>
[0019 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
5 which the resistanceelement connected the first connecting wiring and the resistanceelement connected the second connecting wiring have substantially the same resistancevalue. This mode enables the delay amounts of inspection signals to be input to<br>
extraction wirings corresponding the adjacent connecting wirings and to first wirings<br>
corresponding to the extraction wirings to be substantially equivalent, in the inspection<br>
lOprocess during manufacture or the like of the active matrix substrate. Failures can thereby<br>
be detected that, while not resulting in disconnection, occur in cases such as when the<br>
wiring width is extremely small.<br>
[0020 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
which each of the plurality of bundled wirings has been cut off. This mode results in the<br>
15 plurality of first terminals to which the plurality of third extraction wirings and the<br>
plurality of fourth extraction wirings are respectively connected being electrically<br>
separated from the first common wiring and the second common wiring.<br>
[0021 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
which the first wirings are gate wirings and the second wirings are source wirings. Here,<br>
20 in a mode in which the number of first wirings and the number of second wirings<br>
mutually differ, for example, short circuits between gate wirings, which have a high<br>
failure rate, can be detected if the first wirings are gate wirings, in the case where there<br>
are more first wirings than second wirings. The mounting of a driving circuit (driver) for<br>
gate wirings on a defective active matrix substrate in which a short circuit has occurred<br>
25 between gate wirings can thus be prevented. Thus, loss of material costs and operating<br>
costs can be reduced. Note that a driving circuit for gate wirings has a simple<br>
configuration in comparison with a driving circuit for source wirings that supplies source<br>
signals (video signals) corresponding to a plurality of gradations. In the case where there<br>
are more first wirings than second wirings with the aim of condens1ng the s1ze of the<br>
30 terminal arrangement region and reducing the cost of active matrix substrates, the first<br>
wirings preferably are gate wirings and the second wirings preferably are source wirings.<br>
[0022 ] In the embodiments of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
 <br>
which the first wirings are source wirings and the second wirings are gate wirings.<br>
This mode enables inspection for short circuits between source wirings. That is, s1nce a<br>
driving circuit (driver) for source wirings needs to supply source signals (video signals)<br>
corresponding to a plurality of gradations, the configuration is complex in comparison<br>
5 with a driving circuit (driver) for gate wirings. In other words, a driving circuit for source<br>
wirings is expens1ve in comparison with a driving circuit for gate wirings. The mounting<br>
of a driving circuit (driver) for source wirings on a defective active matrix substrate in<br>
which a short circuit has occurred between source wirings can thus be prevented. Thus,<br>
loss of material costs and operating costs can be reduced.<br>
10[0023 ] In the embodiment of the present invention, a mode preferably is adopted in<br>
which a method for inspecting an active matrix substrate according to the embodiments of<br>
the present invention or a display device provided with an active matrix substrate<br>
according to the embodiments of the present invention includes the processes of<br>
inspecting the third extraction wirings and the fourth extraction wirings by inputting<br>
15 mutually independent inspection signals to the first common wiring and the second<br>
common wiring, and cutting off the plurality of bundled wirings after the inspection<br>
process. This mode enables short circuits between adjacent third extraction wirings and<br>
short circuits between adjacent fourth extraction wirings to be detected by inputting<br>
mutually independent inspection signals to the first common wiring and the second<br>
20common wiring. The plurality of bundled wirings are then cut off in the cutting off<br>
process. The first terminals to which the plurality of third extraction wirings and the<br>
plurality of fourth extraction wirings are respectively connected are thereby electrically<br>
separated from the first common wiring and the second common wiring.<br>
[0024 ] Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
25 reference to the drawings. In the drawings referred to hereinafter, however, for ease of<br>
description only the principal members required in order to describe the present invention<br>
are shown in s1mplified form, among the constituent members of the embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, an active matrix substrate according to the present<br>
invention can be provided with arbitrary constituent members that are not shown in the<br>
30 drawings referred to in the present specification. Also, the dimens1ons of members in the<br>
drawings are not intended to faithfully represent the actual dimens1ons of the constituent<br>
members or the dimens1onal proportions of the members.<br>
 <br>
[0025 ] The above first and second common wirings will be described in the present<br>
embodiment as a first inspection wiring and a second inspection wiring.<br>
[0026 ]<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
5	FIG. 1 is a plan view showing a schematic configuration of a liquid crystal panel<br>
1 according to the present embodiment. As shown in FIG. 1, the liquid crystal panel 1 is<br>
provided with an active matrix substrate 2 and an opposing substrate 3 that opposes the<br>
active matrix substrate 2. A liquid crystal material (not shown) is held sandwiched<br>
between the active matrix substrate 2 and the opposing substrate 3. Note that a color filter<br>
lOlayer that includes R (red), G (green) and B (blue) color filters and a black matrix that<br>
prevents light from leaking between these color filters is formed on the opposing substrate<br>
3 according to the present embodiment. Common electrodes are formed on the color<br>
filter layer.<br>
[0027 ] Here, the liquid crystal panel 1 according to the present embodiment is employed<br>
15 in an electronic device for mobile terminals such as a mobile phone, a PDA (Personal<br>
Digital Ass1stant), a PHS (Personal Handy-phone System) or an HHT (Hand-Held<br>
Terminal), for example. Apart from an electronic device for mobile terminals, the liquid<br>
crystal panel 1 according to the present embodiment is also employed in an electronic<br>
device such as a game terminal, a car navigation system, a personal computer, a<br>
20televis1on, a video camera or a digital camera. Here, an electronic device provided with<br>
the liquid crystal panel 1 is one embodiment of a liquid crystal display device according<br>
to the present invention. Note that the active matrix substrate 2 according to the present<br>
embodiment may be provided in a panel (display device) other than the liquid crystal<br>
panel 1, such as a field emiss1on display, a plasma display, an organic EL display, or an<br>
25 inorganic EL display.<br>
[0028 ] The active matrix substrate 2 has a display region 4, a terminal arrangement<br>
region 5, and a peripheral wiring region 6 that is outside of the display region 4 and<br>
surrounds the display region 4. Note that, hereinafter, one side of the liquid crystal panel<br>
1 will be denoted as a first side S1 (lower side in FIG. 1), the sides on the left and right<br>
30 sandwiching this first side S1 will be denoted respectively as a second side S2 and a third<br>
side S3, and the side opposing the first side S1 will be denoted as a fourth side S4.<br>
[0029 ] Here, as shown in FIG. 1, a length H of the second side S2 (third side S3) of the<br>
 <br>
active matrix substrate 2 is longer than a length L of the second side S2 (third side S3) of<br>
the opposing substrate 3. In the case where the active matrix substrate 2 and the opposing<br>
substrate 3 are adhered together via the liquid crystal material (not shown), the terminal<br>
arrangement region 5 of the active matrix substrate 2 will be pos1tioned closer to first side<br>
5 s1 than is the opposing substrate 3.<br>
[0030 ] First gate wirings 401 to 407, second gate wirings 411 to 417, and source wirings<br>
421, 422, 423, . ..42i are formed in the display region 4. Here, the first gate wirings 401 to<br>
407 respectively have input ends 431 to 437 for gate signals at one end. Also, the second<br>
gate wirings 411 to 417 respectively have input ends 441 to 447 for gate signals at an<br>
l0oppos1te end. Further, the source wirings 421, 422, 423, ...42i respectively have input ends<br>
45t, 452, 453, ...45i for source signals at one end.<br>
[0031 ] In FIG. 1, for ease of description, seven first gate wirings 401 to 407 and seven<br>
second gate wirings 411 to 417 are shown, but the number of first gate wirings and second<br>
gate wirings to be formed in the display region 4 is actually greater than this. The number<br>
15 of first gate wirings and second gate wirings is, however, arbitrary and not particularly<br>
limited here.<br>
[0032 ] Note that, hereinafter, only in the case where individual wirings need to be<br>
distinguished will description be given with the subscripts for distinguishing individual<br>
wirings attached, such as source wiring 421, for example, and in the case where individual<br>
20 wirings do not particularly need to be distinguished or in the case where the wirings are<br>
referred to collectively, description will be given without attaching the subscripts, such as<br>
source wirings 42, for example. Also, hereinafter, in cases where the first gate wirings 401<br>
to 407 and the second gate wirings 411 to 417 do not need to be distinguished or are<br>
referred to collectively, description will refer s1mply to gate wirings 40 and 41.<br>
25[0033 ] Here, in the present embodiment, the first gate wirings 401 to 407 and the second<br>
gate wirings 411 to 417 are formed in the display region 4 alternately per wiring and so as<br>
to be parallel to each other. That is, the gate wirings 40 and 41 are formed in the display<br>
region 4 so as to be arranged from the fourth side S4 toward the first side s1 as follows:<br>
first gate wiring 401, second gate wiring 411, first gate wiring 402, second gate wiring 412,<br>
30 first gate wiring 403, second gate wiring 413, and so on. The source wirings 421,422, 423,<br>
.. .42i are formed in the display region 4 parallel to each other and so as to intersect the<br>
gate wirings 40 and 41.<br>
 <br>
[0034 ] In the present embodiment, the source wirings 42 are formed in the display<br>
region 4 per RGB. In other words, source wirings 42 for R, source wirings 42 for G and<br>
source wirings 42 for B are formed in the display region 4. In the case of a monochrome<br>
liquid crystal panel 1, however, the present invention is not limited thereto. Further, apart<br>
5 from the gate wirings 40 and 41 and the source wirings 42, storage capacitor wirings (not<br>
shown) are formed in the display region 4. The storage capacitor wirings are formed in<br>
the display region 4 so as to be parallel to the gate wirings 40 and 41.<br>
[0035 ] Note that switching elements such as TFTs (Thin Film TranS1stors) or MIM<br>
(Metal Insulator Metal) (not shown) and picture element electrodes (R, G or B) (not<br>
1 Oshown) connected to these switching elements are formed at the intersecting portions of<br>
the gate wirings 40 and 41 and the source wirings 42.<br>
[0036 ] The terminal arrangement region 5 is a region in which a plurality of gate<br>
terminals 51 and a plurality of source terminals 52 are arranged on the active matrix<br>
substrate 2. A driver or a flexible wiring substrate provided with a driver is electrically<br>
15 connected to the gate terminals 51 and the source terminals 52 in the terminal<br>
arrangement region 5. The gate terminals 51 are thus terminals to which gate signals can<br>
be input from the driver. The source terminals 52 are terminals to which source signals<br>
can be input from the driver. Note that a driver can be connected in the terminal<br>
arrangement region 5 with a COG (Chip on Glass) method. Also, a flexible wiring<br>
20 substrate provided with a driver can be connected in the terminal arrangement region 5<br>
with a TCP (Tape Carrier Package) method. Note that the connection method is not<br>
particularly limited here.<br>
[0037 ] Note that FIG. 1 shows an example in which a S1ngle driver can be disposed in<br>
the terminal arrangement region 5, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For<br>
25 example, by providing a plurality of terminal arrangement regions 5 on the active matrix<br>
substrate 2, a configuration may be adopted in which a plurality of drivers can be<br>
disposed in each of the plurality of terminal arrangement regions 5.<br>
[0038 ] Right-side gate extraction wirings (first extraction wirings) 611 to 617<br>
respectively connecting the gate terminals 51 and the input ends 431 to 437 for gate signals<br>
30 provided at one end of the first gate wirings 401 to 407 are formed in the peripheral wiring<br>
region 6. That is, the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 are extracted from the<br>
input ends 431 to 437 for gate Signals toward the third side S3, formed in the peripheral<br>
 <br>
wiring region 6 along the third side S3, and connected to the gate terminals 51.<br>
[0039 ] Here, the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 include first right-side gate<br>
extraction wirings (third extraction wirings) 611, 613, 615 and 617 and second right-side<br>
gate extraction wirings (fourth extraction wirings) 612, 614 and 616. The first right-side<br>
5 gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617 are extraction wirings formed on the same<br>
layer as the layer on which the gate wirings 40 and 41 are formed. Note that, hereinafter,<br>
the layer on which the gate wirings 40 and 41 are formed will be referred to as a "first<br>
layer". The second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 are extraction<br>
wirings of which at least a portion thereof is formed on a different layer from the layer<br>
10 (first layer) on which the gate wirings 40 to 41 are formed with an insulating material<br>
sandwiched therebetween. Note that, hereinafter, the different layer from the layer on<br>
which the gate wirings 40 and 41 are formed will be referred to as a "second layer". In<br>
other words, the source wirings 42 are formed on the second layer.<br>
[0040 ] Here, the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 respectively<br>
15 have first wiring-layer connecting portions 622, 624 and 626 formed in proximity to the<br>
input ends 432, 434 and 436 for gate signals, and second wiring-layer connecting portions<br>
632, 634 and 636 formed in proximity to the gate terminals 51. In the present embodiment,<br>
wiring of the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 between the input<br>
ends 432, 434 and 436 for gate signals and first wiring-layer connecting portions 622, 624<br>
20 and 626 is formed on the first layer, wiring between the first wiring-layer connecting<br>
portions 622, 624 and 626and the second wiring-layer connecting portions 632, 634 and 636<br>
is formed on the second layer, and wiring between the second wiring-layer connecting<br>
portions 632, 634 and 636 and the gate terminals 51 is formed on the first layer. That is,<br>
wiring formed on the first layer and wiring formed on the second layer are respectively<br>
25 electrically connected to the first wiring-layer connecting portions 622, 624 and 626 and<br>
the second wiring-layer connecting portions 632, 634 and 636.<br>
[0041 ] Note that as for the method for electrically connecting the wiring, the wiring<br>
formed on the first layer and the wiring formed on the second layer may be directly<br>
connected via contact holes formed in the insulating material, or the wiring formed on the<br>
30 first layer and the wiring formed on the second layer may be electrically connected via<br>
electrodes further formed on a separate layer. That is, as far as the method for electrically<br>
connecting the wiring is concerned, various arbitrary methods can be used, with the<br>
 <br>
method not being particularly limited here. Also, the poS1tions of the first wiring-layer<br>
connecting portions 622, 624 and 626 and the second wiring-layer connecting portions 632,<br>
634 and 636 are arbitrary and not intended to be limited to the poS1tions shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0042 ] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view sectioned along a section line a-a' shown in FIG.<br>
5 1. As shown in FIG. 2, the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611,613, 615 and 617 are<br>
formed as a first layer on the active matrix substrate 2. An insulating film (insulating<br>
material) 7 is formed on the active matrix substrate 2, so as to cover the first right-side<br>
gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617. The second right-side gate extraction<br>
wirings 612, 614 and 616 are formed as a second layer on the insulating film 7. Further, a<br>
10 protective film 8 is formed on the insulating film 7, so as to cover the second right-side<br>
gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616. That is, the insulating film 7 is interposed<br>
between the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617 and the second<br>
right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616.<br>
[0043 ] Thus, in the present embodiment, the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611,<br>
15 613, 615 and 617 are formed on the first layer, and at least a portion of the second right-<br>
side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 is formed on the second layer. A more<br>
compact and higher definition active matrix substrate can thus be realized in comparison<br>
with a mode in which all of the right-Side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 are formed on<br>
a S1ngle layer.<br>
20[0044 ] FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of an E1 portion shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG.<br>
3, right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 are further respectively connected to the<br>
plurality of gate terminals 51 to which the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 are<br>
connected. That is, the right-side gate connecting wirings 641to 647 are respectively<br>
extracted from the plurality of gate terminals 51 toward the first side S1 (in proximity to<br>
25 inspection wirings 66 and 67 described later).<br>
[0045 ] Here, the right-side gate connecting wirings 641to 647 include first right-side<br>
gate connecting wirings (first connecting wirings) 641 643, 645 and 647 and second right-<br>
side gate connecting wirings (second connecting wirings) 642,644 and 646. The first<br>
right-side gate connecting wirings 641, 643, 645 and 647 are connecting wirings that are<br>
30connected to gate terminals 51 to which the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611,<br>
613,615and 617 are connected. The second right-side gate connecting wirings 642, 644<br>
and 646 are connecting wirings that are connected to gate terminals 51 to which the<br>
 <br>
second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 are connected.<br>
[0046 ] Right-side bundled wirings (bundled wirings) 651 to 654 each composed of a<br>
mutually adjacent first right-side gate connecting wiring and second right-side gate<br>
connecting wiring bundled together are formed in the peripheral wiring region 6. In the<br>
5 present embodiment, the right-side bundled wiring 651 bundles two wirings, namely, the<br>
first right-side gate connecting wiring 641 and the second right-side gate connecting<br>
wiring 642 into a S1ngle wiring. Also, the right-side bundled wiring 652 bundles the first<br>
right-side gate connecting wiring 643 and the second right-side gate connecting wiring 644<br>
into a S1ngle wiring. Further, the right-side bundled wiring 653 bundles the first right-side<br>
10 gate connecting wiring 645 and the second right-side gate connecting wiring 646 into a<br>
S1ngle wiring. Note that the right-side bundled wiring 654 is only connected to a S1ngle<br>
wiring, namely, the first right-side gate connecting wiring 647.<br>
[0047 ] A first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 is further connected to the right-side<br>
bundled wirings 652 and 654. Also, a second right-side gate inspection wiring 67 is<br>
15 connected to the right-side bundled wirings 651 and 653, over the first right-side gate<br>
inspection wiring 66. That is, the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 is an<br>
inspection wiring capable of inputting an inspection signal to the non-adjacent right-side<br>
bundled wirings 652 and 654 among the right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654. The second<br>
right-side gate inspection wiring 67 is an inspection wiring capable of inputting an<br>
20 inspection signal to the non-adjacent right-side bundled wirings 65] and 653 that are not<br>
connected to the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 among the right-side bundled<br>
wirings 651 to 654.<br>
[0048 ] Note that because the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67 is connected to<br>
the right-side bundled wirings 651 and 653 across the first right-side gate inspection wiring<br>
25 66, the right-side bundled wirings 65x and 653 respectively have third wiring-layer<br>
connecting portions 681 and 683 and fourth wiring-layer connecting portions 69i and 693.<br>
That is, the right-side bundled wirings 65i and 653 and the second right-side gate<br>
inspection wiring 67 are respectively electrically connected to the fourth wiring-layer<br>
connecting portions 691 and 693.<br>
30[0049 ] A first right-side gate inspection pad 70 is further connected to the first right-side<br>
gate inspection wiring 66. The first right-side gate inspection pad 70 is a pad to which an<br>
inspection signal can be input. An inspection signal can thereby be input to the right-side<br>
 <br>
gate extraction wirings 613, 614 and 617 from the first right-side gate inspection pad 70,<br>
via the right-side bundled wirings 652 and 654 and the right-side gate connecting wirings<br>
643, 644 and 647. Further, a second right-side gate inspection pad 71 is further connected<br>
to the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67. The second right-side gate inspection<br>
5 pad 71 is also a pad to which an inspection signal can be input. An inspection signal can<br>
thereby be input to the right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 612,615 and 616 from the<br>
second right-side gate inspection pad 71, via the right-side bundled wirings 651 and 653<br>
and the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 642,645 and 646.<br>
[0050 ] As described above, with the active matrix substrate 2 according to the present<br>
10 embodiment, right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654 each composed of a mutually adjacent<br>
first right-side gate connecting wiring and second right-side gate connecting wiring<br>
bundled together are formed, with the right-side bundled wirings 652 and 654 being<br>
connected to the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 and the right-side bundled<br>
wirings 651 and 653 being connected to the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67.<br>
15 The space between the wirings can thus be widened and the number of wiring-layer<br>
connecting portions can be reduced, in comparison with a mode in which each of the<br>
right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 are directly connected to the first right-side<br>
gate inspection wiring 66 or the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67 without<br>
providing the right-side bundled wirings. That is, short circuits between the right-side<br>
20 bundled wirings 651 to 654 are unlikely to occur because the spacing between the right-<br>
side bundled wirings 651 to 654 (K in FIG. 3) can be widened. Also, connection failures<br>
and the like in the wiring-layer connecting portions can be reduced because of being able<br>
to reduce the number of wiring-layer connecting portions. As a result, the yield of the<br>
liquid crystal panel 1 improves because of being able to reliably inspect (for<br>
25 disconnection, short circuits, etc.) the active matrix substrate 2.<br>
[0051 ] Also, with the active matrix substrate 2 according to the present embodiment, the<br>
forming of right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654 each composed of a mutually adjacent<br>
first right-side gate connecting wiring and second right-side gate connecting wiring<br>
bundled together enables the number of wirings extending over the first right-side gate<br>
30 inspection wiring 66 (i.e., the number of intersecting portions of the right-side bundled<br>
wirings 651 to 654 and the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66) to be reduced. Being<br>
able to reduce the number of intersecting portions enables the load on the first right-side<br>
 <br>
gate inspection wiring 66 to be reduced. Being able to reduce the load enables the delay<br>
of inspection signals input from first right-side gate inspection pad 70 to the first right-<br>
side gate inspection wiring 66 to be reduced. As a result, fine defects, such as short<br>
circuits between picture element electrodes and source wirings 42, can be detected,<br>
5 because deS1red inspection signals can be input to the gate wirings 40 and 41.<br>
[0052 ] Further, according to the active matrix substrate 2 of the present embodiment,<br>
the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 is connected to each of the right-side bundled<br>
wirings 652 and 654 and the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67 is connected to<br>
each of the right-side bundled wirings 651 and 653. Static electricity generated in the<br>
10 active matrix substrate 2 can thus be eliminated or dispersed from the first right-side gate<br>
inspection wiring 66 and the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67. Being able to<br>
eliminate or disperse static electricity generated in the active matrix substrate 2 enables<br>
short circuit or disconnection due to static electricity to be suppressed, as well as<br>
suppresS1ng changes in TFT or MIM characteristics and the like.<br>
15[0053 ] Note that S1milar effects to those described above are obtained with regard to<br>
left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757, left-side bundled wirings 761 to 764, a first<br>
left-side gate inspection wiring 77 and a second left-side gate inspection wiring 78 that<br>
will be described later.<br>
[0054 ] Returning to FIG. 1, left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727 respectively<br>
20 connecting the gate terminals 51 and the input ends 441 to 447 for gate signals provided at<br>
the oppoS1te end of the second gate wirings 411 to 417 are formed in the peripheral wiring<br>
region 6. That is, the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727 are extracted from the<br>
input ends 441 to 447 for gate signals toward the second side S2, formed in the peripheral<br>
wiring region 6 along the second side S2, and connected to the gate terminals 51.<br>
25[0055 ] Here, the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727 include first left-side gate<br>
extraction wirings 721, 723, 725 and 727 and second left-side gate extraction wirings 722,<br>
724 and 726. The first left-side gate extraction wirings 721, 723, 725 and 727 are extraction<br>
wirings formed on the first layer. The second left-side gate extraction wirings 722, 724<br>
and 726 are extraction wirings formed on the second layer.<br>
30[0056 ] Here, the second left-side gate extraction wirings 722, 724 and 726 respectively<br>
have fifth wiring-layer connecting portions 732, 734 and 736 formed in proximity to the<br>
input ends 442, 444 and 446 for gate signals, and S1xth wiring-layer connecting portions<br>
 <br>
742,744 and 746 formed in proximity to the gate terminals 51. In the present embodiment,<br>
wiring of the second left-side gate extraction wirings 722, 724 and 726 between the input<br>
ends 442, 444 and 446 for gate signals and the fifth wiring-layer connecting portions 732,<br>
734 and 736 is formed on the first layer, wiring between the fifth wiring-layer connecting<br>
5portions 732, 734 and 736 and the S1xth wiring-layer connecting portions 742, 744 and 746 is<br>
formed on the second layer, and wiring between the S1xth wiring-layer connecting<br>
portions 742, 744 and 746 and the gate terminals 51 is formed on the first layer. That is,<br>
wiring formed on the first layer and wiring formed on the second layer are respectively<br>
electrically connected to the fifth wiring-layer connecting portions 732, 734 and 736 and<br>
10 the S1xth wiring-layer connecting portions 742, 744 and 746.<br>
[0057 ] FIG. 4 is an enlarged view of an E2 portion shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG.<br>
4, left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 are further respectively connected to the<br>
plurality of gate terminals 51 to which the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727 are<br>
connected. That is, the left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 are respectively<br>
15 extracted from the plurality of gate terminals 51 toward the first side S1 (in proximity to<br>
inspection wirings 77 and 78 described later).<br>
[0058 ] Here, the left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 include first left-side gate<br>
connecting wirings 751, 753, 755and 757 and second left-side gate connecting wirings 752,<br>
754 and 756. The first left-side gate connecting wirings 751, 753, 755 and 757 are<br>
20 connecting wirings that are connected to gate terminals 51 to which the first left-side gate<br>
extraction wirings 721, 723, 725 and 727 are connected. The second left-side gate<br>
connecting wirings 752, 754 and 756 are connecting wirings that are connected to gate<br>
terminals 51 to which the second left-side gate extraction wirings 722, 724 and 726 are<br>
connected.<br>
25[0059 ] Left-side bundled wirings 761 to 764 each composed of a mutually adjacent first<br>
left-side gate connecting wiring and second left-side gate connecting wiring bundled<br>
together are formed in the peripheral wiring region 6. In the present embodiment, the<br>
left-side bundled wiring 76, bundles two wirings, namely, the first left-side gate<br>
connecting wiring 751 and the second left-side gate connecting wiring 752 into a S1ngle<br>
30wiring. Also, the left-side bundled wiring 762 bundles the first left-side gate connecting<br>
wiring 753 and the second left-side gate connecting wiring 754 into a S1ngle wiring.<br>
Further, the left-side bundled wiring 763 bundles the first left-side gate connecting wiring<br>
 <br>
755 and the second left-side gate connecting wiring 756 into a S1ngle wiring. Note that the<br>
left-side bundled wiring 764 is only connected to the first left-side gate connecting wiring<br>
757.<br>
[0060 ] A first left-side gate inspection wiring 77 is further connected to the left-side<br>
5 bundled wirings 762 and 764. A second left-side gate inspection wiring 78 is connected to<br>
the left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763, across the first left-side gate inspection wiring<br>
77. That is, the first left-side gate inspection wiring 77 is an inspection wiring capable of<br>
inputting an inspection signal to the non-adjacent left-side bundled wirings 762 and 764<br>
among the left-side bundled wirings 761 to 764. Also, the second left-side gate inspection<br>
10 wiring 78 is an inspection wiring capable of inputting an inspection signal to the non-<br>
adjacent left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763 that are not connected to the first left-side<br>
gate inspection wiring 77 among the left-side bundled wirings 761 to 764.<br>
[0061 ] Note that because the second left-side gate inspection wiring 78 is connected to<br>
the left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763 over the first left-side gate inspection wiring 77,<br>
15 the left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763 respectively have seventh wiring-layer<br>
connecting portions 791 and 793 and eighth wiring-layer connecting portions 801 and 803.<br>
That is, the left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763 and the second left-side gate inspection<br>
wiring 78 are respectively electrically connected to the eighth wiring-layer connecting<br>
portions 801 and 803.<br>
20[0062 ] A first left-side gate inspection pad 81 is further connected to the first left-side<br>
gate inspection wiring 77. The first left-side gate inspection pad 81 is a pad to which an<br>
inspection signal can be input. An inspection signal can thereby be input to the left-side<br>
gate extraction wirings 723, 724 and 727 from the first left-side gate inspection pad 81, via<br>
the left-side bundled wirings 762 and 764 and the left-side gate connecting wirings 753, 754<br>
25 and 757. Further, a second left-side gate inspection pad 82 is further connected to the<br>
second left-side gate inspection wiring 78. The second left-side gate inspection pad 82 is<br>
also a pad to which an inspection signal can be input An inspection signal can thereby be<br>
input to the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 722,725 and 726 from the second left-side<br>
gate inspection pad 82, via the left-side bundled wirings 761 and 763 and the left-side gate<br>
30connecting wirings 751, 752,755 and 756<br>
[0063 ] Returning to FIG. 1, source extraction wirings 831, 832, 833, ... 83i respectively<br>
connecting the source terminals 52 and the input ends 451, 452, 453, ...45i for source<br>
 <br>
signals provided at one end of the source wirings 421, 422,423, ...42i are formed in the<br>
peripheral wiring region 6. That is, the source extraction wirings 83 are extracted from<br>
the input ends 45 for source signals toward the first side S1 and connected to the source<br>
terminals 52.<br>
5[0064 ] Here, source connecting wirings 841, 842, 843, ... 84i are further respectively<br>
connected to the source terminals 52 to which the source extraction wirings 831, 832, 833,<br>
... 83i are connected. That is, the source connecting wirings 841, 842, 843, ... 84i are<br>
respectively extracted from the plurality of source terminals 52 toward the first side S1 (in<br>
proximity to inspection wirings 85 and 86 discussed later).<br>
10[0065 ] A first source inspection wiring 85 is further connected to source connecting<br>
wirings 841, 843, 845, ... 84i. A second source inspection wiring 86 is further connected to<br>
source connecting wirings 842, 844, 846, ... 84i-1. That is, the first source inspection wiring<br>
85 is an inspection wiring capable of inputting an inspection signal to the source<br>
connecting wirings 841, 843, 845, ... 84i that are not adjacent to each other among the<br>
15 plurality of source connecting wirings 841, 842, 843,... 84i;. The second source inspection<br>
wiring 86 is an inspection wiring capable of inputting an inspection signal to the source<br>
connecting wirings 842, 844, 846, ... 84i-1 that are not adjacent to each other and not<br>
connected to the first source inspection wiring 85 among the plurality of source<br>
connecting wirings 841, 842, 843, ... 84i.<br>
20[0066 ] A first source inspection pad 87 is further connected to the first source inspection<br>
wiring 85. The first source inspection pad 87 is a pad to which an inspection signal can<br>
be input. An inspection signal can thereby be input to the source extraction wirings 831,<br>
833, 835, ... 83i from the first source inspection pad 87 via the first source inspection<br>
wiring 85 and the source connecting wirings 841, 843, 845, ... 84i. Further, a second<br>
25 source inspection pad 88 is further connected to the second source inspection wiring 86.<br>
The second source inspection pad 88 is also a pad to which an inspection signal can be<br>
input An inspection signal can thereby be input to the source extraction wirings 832, 834,<br>
836, ... 83i-1 from the second source inspection pad 88 via the second source inspection<br>
wiring 86 and the source connecting wirings 842, 844, 846, ... 84I-1<br>
30[0067 ] Further, a common inspection wiring 89 is formed in the peripheral wiring<br>
region 6, so as to enclose the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 and the left-side<br>
gate extraction wirings 721 to 727. Common electrode pads 90 and 91 are connected to<br>
 <br>
the common inspection wiring 89. Transfer pads 92 and 93 are further connected to the<br>
common inspection wiring 89. The transfer pads 92 and 93 are connected to common<br>
electrodes (not shown) that are formed on the opposing substrate 3. A common voltage<br>
can thereby be applied to the common electrodes formed on the opposing substrate 3 from<br>
5 the common electrode pads 90 and 91.<br>
[0068 ] Next, a method for manufacturing the liquid crystal panel 1 according to the<br>
present embodiment will be described. Note that, hereinafter, an inspection process of<br>
inspecting the electrical connection state of the liquid crystal panel 1 will, in particular, be<br>
described in detail.<br>
10 [0069 ] That is, thin films such as a conductive film, an insulating film and a protective<br>
film are laminated on a transparent glass substrate to manufacture a base substrate for<br>
active matrix substrates on which are formed a plurality of active matrix substrate regions<br>
to be cut out as active matrix substrates 2. Also, thin films such as a black matrix, color<br>
filters, a conductive film and an orientation film are laminated on a transparent glass<br>
15 substrate to manufacture a base substrate for opposing substrates on which are formed a<br>
plurality of opposing substrate regions to be cut out as opposing substrates 3. A sealant is<br>
applied to one of the two base substrates. The two base substrates are then adhered<br>
together after the sealant has been applied.<br>
[0070 ] The two base substrates adhered together are then sectioned as mother substrates<br>
20 from which a prescribed number (e.g., four in the horizontal direction) of liquid crystal<br>
panels 1 having an active matrix substrate 2 and an opposing substrate 3 are formed. That<br>
is, the liquid crystal panel 1 shown in FIG. 1 is a S1ngle liquid crystal panel that has been<br>
sectioned as a mother substrate into which a liquid crystal material has been injected.<br>
Accordingly, although illustration thereof has been omitted, other liquid crystal panels<br>
25 exist to, for example, the left and right of the liquid crystal panel 1 shown in FIG. 1. A<br>
liquid crystal material is injected into each of the liquid crystal panel 1 sectioned as<br>
mother substrates using a vacuum injection method, for example, through an inlet formed<br>
between the active matrix substrate 2 and the opposing substrate 3. Note that the liquid<br>
crystal material may be injected using a drop filling method rather than a vacuum<br>
30 injection method. In this case, neither the inlet nor a process of sealing the inlet portion is<br>
required.<br>
[0071 ] An inspection process of inspecting the electrical connection state of the liquid<br>
 <br>
crystal panel 1 is then performed, prior to attaching the driver in the terminal arrangement<br>
region 5. That is, the inspection process is for inspecting for disconnection or short<br>
circuit of wiring and for picture element electrode defects in the active matrix substrate 2<br>
of the liquid crystal panel 1.<br>
5[0072 ] As for the inspection method, an inspection probe is brought into contact with<br>
each of the inspection pads 70, 71, 81, 82, 87, 88, 90 and 91, and a prescribed voltage is<br>
applied thereto, for example. Note that the order in which the inspection probe is brought<br>
into contact with the inspection pads 70, 71, 81, 82, 87, 88, 90 and 91 is not particularly<br>
limited here. A gate signal that functions as a scan signal is thereby input to the gate<br>
10 wirings 40 and 41. Note that this inspection signal is a signal that switches on the<br>
switching element of each picture element for a fixed period. Also, an inspection signal<br>
that functions as a source signal is input to the source wirings 42. Note that this<br>
inspection signal is a signal that orients the liquid crystal in each picture element region in<br>
a deS1red direction.<br>
15 [0073 ] When the molecular orientation direction of the liquid crystal is controlled as a<br>
result of an inspection signal that functions as a source signal being input to each picture<br>
element electrode with the switching element of each picture element in an ON state, and<br>
the liquid crystal panel 1 is irradiated from the back surface thereof by irradiation means<br>
such as a backlight, for example, an image will be displayed on the display screen of the<br>
20 liquid crystal panel 1 corresponding to the display region 4 of the active matrix substrate<br>
2 (hereinafter, "display screen of the liquid crystal panel 1"). Accordingly, inspection can<br>
be made for disconnection and short circuit of wiring in the active matrix substrate 2 of<br>
the liquid crystal panel 1 by, for example, an inspector visually inspecting the display<br>
screen of the liquid crystal panel 1. Note that an image recognition device may be used<br>
25 instead of or in addition to visual inspection by an inspector, or inspection may be<br>
performed using a detection device or the like that electrically detects disconnection or<br>
short circuit of wiring.<br>
[0074 ] Here, a method for detecting short circuits of the right-side gate extraction<br>
wirings 611 to 617 will be described. Specifically, firstly, the inspection probe is brought<br>
30 into contact with the first source inspection pad 87, the second source inspection pad 88,<br>
and the common electrode pads 90 and 91. In this state, mutually independent inspection<br>
signals are input to the first right-side gate inspection wiring 66 and the second right-side<br>
 <br>
gate inspection wiring 67. For example, the inspection probe is brought into contact with<br>
only the second right-side gate inspection pad 71 and is not brought into contact with the<br>
first right-side gate inspection pad 70. This results in an inspection signal being input to<br>
the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 612, 615 and 616 from the second right-side gate<br>
5 inspection pad 71 via the right-side bundled wirings 651 and 653 and the right-side gate<br>
connecting wirings 641, 642, 645 and 646. On the other hand, because the inspection probe<br>
is not in contact with the first right-side gate inspection pad 70, an inspection signal is not<br>
input to the right-side gate extraction wirings 613, 614and 617 from the first right-side gate<br>
inspection pad 70.<br>
10[0075 ] That is, the inspection signal is only input to the first right-side gate extraction<br>
wirings 61j and 615 among the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617<br>
on the first layer (see FIG. 2). Thus, in the case where there is a short circuit between the<br>
first right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617 formed on the first layer, not<br>
only will the lines corresponding to the first gate wirings 401 and 405 connected to the first<br>
15 right-side gate extraction wirings 611 and 615 to which the inspection signal is input be<br>
displayed on the display screen of the liquid crystal panel 1, but lines corresponding to the<br>
first gate wirings 403 and 407 connected to the first right-side gate extraction wirings 613<br>
and 617 to which the inspection signal is not input will also be displayed. Thus, the<br>
inspector is able to detect that there is a short circuit between the right-side gate extraction<br>
20wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617 formed on the first layer.<br>
[0076 ] Also, the inspection signal is only input to the second right-side gate extraction<br>
wirings 612 and 616 among the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616<br>
on the second layer (see FIG. 2). Thus, in the case where there is a short circuit between<br>
the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 formed on the second layer,<br>
25 not only will the lines corresponding to the first gate wirings 402 and 406 connected to the<br>
second right-side gate extraction wirings 612 and 616 to which the inspection signal is<br>
input be displayed, but lines corresponding to the first gate wiring 404 connected to the<br>
second right-side gate extraction wiring 614 to which the inspection signal is not input<br>
will also be displayed. Thus, the inspector is able to detect that there is a short circuit<br>
30 between the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 formed on the<br>
second layer.<br>
[0077 ] Also, similary to the above, the inspection probe is brought into contact with<br>
 <br>
only the second left-side gate inspection pad 82 and is not brought into contact with the<br>
first left-side gate inspection pad 81, for example. The inspector is thereby able to detect<br>
a short circuit between the first left-side gate extraction wirings 721, 723, 725 and 727<br>
formed on the first layer, and a short circuit between the second left-side gate extraction<br>
5 wirings 722, 724 and 726 formed on the second layer.<br>
[0078 ] Note that in the case where the right-side gate extraction wirings 611 to 617 are<br>
disconnected, all of the lines corresponding to first gate wirings connected to<br>
disconnected right-side gate extraction wirings will not be displayed. similary, in the<br>
case where the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727 are disconnected, all of the lines<br>
10 corresponding to second gate wirings connected to disconnected left-side gate extraction<br>
wirings will not be displayed on the display screen of the liquid crystal panel 1. The<br>
inspector is thereby able to detect disconnection of the right-side gate extraction wirings<br>
611 to 617 and the left-side gate extraction wirings 721 to 727.<br>
[0079 ] Also, in the case where the gate wirings 40 and 41 are disconnected, lines<br>
15 corresponding to gate wirings at and after the location of the disconnection will not be<br>
displayed on the display screen of the liquid crystal 1. similary, in the case where the<br>
source wirings 42 are disconnected, lines corresponding to source wirings at and after the<br>
location of the disconnection will not be displayed on the display screen of the liquid<br>
crystal 1. The inspector is thereby able to detect disconnection of the gate wirings 40 and<br>
20 41 and the source wirings 42. Inputting mutually independent inspection signals to the<br>
first source inspection wiring 85 and the second source inspection wiring 86 enables the<br>
inspector to detect a short circuit of the source wirings 42 and the source extraction<br>
wirings 83.<br>
[0080 ] Further, inputting an inspection signal having a pulse waveform deS1red by the<br>
25 inspector to the gate wirings 40 and 41 and the source wirings 42 enables short circuits to<br>
also be detected between the picture element electrodes and the source wirings 42. That<br>
is, not only inspection for short circuit and disconnection of the gate wirings 40 and 41,<br>
the source wirings 42, the right-side gate extraction wirings 61 and the left-side gate<br>
extraction wirings 72, but also inspection for defects in picture element electrodes or the<br>
30 like can be performed.<br>
[0081 ] Once the above inspection process is finished, a cutting off process of cutting off<br>
the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 and the left-side gate connecting wirings<br>
 <br>
751 to 757 is performed. Specifically, the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 are<br>
cut off along the outline C shown in FIG. 3, for example, using a laser. Electrical<br>
continuity is thereby no longer established between the gate terminals 51 respectively<br>
connected to the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617 and the gate<br>
5 terminals 51 respectively connected to the second right-side gate extraction wirings 612,<br>
614 and 616. Also, the left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 are cut off along the<br>
cutline C shown in FIG. 4, for example, using a laser. Electrical continuity is thereby no<br>
longer established between the gate terminals 51 respectively connected to the first left<br>
side gate extraction wirings 721, 723, 725 and 727 and the gate terminals 51 respectively<br>
10 connected to the second left-side gate extraction wirings 722, 724 and 726.<br>
[0082 ] Note that while an example in which the connecting wirings are cut off along the<br>
cutline C using a laser was described above, the connecting wirings may, in the case of a<br>
liquid crystal panel 1a such shown in FIG. 5, for example, be divided at the same time as<br>
the substrates using a wheel cutter, for example, along a division line D. In this case, the<br>
15 process of manufacturing a liquid crystal panel is S1mplified, because the connecting<br>
wirings do not need to cut off along the cutline C using a laser. Also, the profile of the<br>
liquid crystal panel to be installed in the display device can be reduced, because the A<br>
portion of the substrate in FIG. 5 on which the inspection pads 70, 71,81, 82, 87, 88, 90<br>
and 91 are formed is separated.<br>
20[0083 ] Once the cutting off process is finished, a mounting process of mounting a driver<br>
for driving and controlling the gate wirings 40 and 41 and the source wirings 42 in the<br>
terminal arrangement region 5 is performed. Subsequently, the individual liquid crystal<br>
panels 1 are then cut out from the mother board. An optical film such as a polarizer is<br>
adhered to the cut out liquid crystal panels 1. Liquid crystal panels 1 are thereby<br>
25 manufactured. Note that the method for manufacturing the liquid crystal panel 1 is not<br>
intended to be limited to the above method. For example, with a monochrome liquid<br>
crystal panel, color filters need not be laminated on the opposing substrate. Also, the<br>
inspection process and the mounting process may be performed after the individual liquid<br>
crystal panels have been cut out.<br>
30[0084 ] As discussed above, according to the active matrix substrate 2 in the present<br>
embodiment, short circuits between adjacent extraction wirings formed on the same layer<br>
(first right-side gate extraction wirings, second right-side gate extraction wirings, first<br>
 <br>
left-side gate extraction wirings, second left-side gate extraction wirings) can be reliably<br>
detected with a simple configuration in the case where extraction wirings are formed on<br>
each of a plurality of layers.<br>
[0085 ]<br>
5 Embodiment 2<br>
FIG. 6 is an enlarged view of the same portion as the E1 portion shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a resistanceelement R is further connected to each of the right-side<br>
gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 according to the present embodiment. Here, resistanceelements R are, for example, constituted by patterns formed by ITO, IZO or the like to be<br>
l0used as pixel electrodes, patterns formed with a TFT semiconductor film, diodes,<br>
tranS1stors, arbitrary patterns and the like. Note that a resistanceelement R is also further<br>
connected to each of the left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 according to the<br>
present embodiment<br>
[0086 ] Hereinafter, the respective cases of the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to<br>
15 647 and the right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654 will be described, with the description<br>
similary applying to the cases of the left-side gate connecting wirings 751 to 757 and left<br>
side bundled wirings 761 to 764.<br>
[0087 ] That is, S1nce a resistanceelements R is connected to each of the right-side gate<br>
connecting wirings 641 to 647, the right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654 can be cut off<br>
20 instead of the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 in the cutting off process.<br>
Specifically, the right-side bundled wirings 651 to 654 are cut off using a laser along a<br>
cutline C shown in FIG. 6, for example. Note that similary to Embodiment 1, the right-<br>
side bundled wirings 651 to 654 may be divided at the same time as the substrates using a<br>
wheel cutter, for example, along a division line.<br>
25[0088 ] Thus, in the present embodiment, because the right-side bundled wirings 651 to<br>
654 are cut off, the number of wirings to be cut off is fewer than in the case where the<br>
right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 are cut off, such as in Embodiment 1. As a<br>
result, the time taken in the cutting off process can be decreased.<br>
[0089 ] In the present embodiment, electrical continuity will be established between the<br>
30 gate terminals 51 to which the first right-side gate extraction wirings 611, 613, 615 and 617<br>
are respectively connected and the gate terminals 51 to which the second right-side gate<br>
extraction wirings 612, 614 and 616 are respectively connected, even if the right-side<br>
 <br>
bundled wirings 651 to 654 are cut off. However, if the values of the resistance elements R<br>
respectively connected to the right-side gate connecting wirings 641 to 647 are set<br>
sufficiently high, operation of an electronic device will be problem free even in the case<br>
where the liquid crystal panel 1 according to the present embodiment is incorporated in<br>
5 the electronic device. Also, even in the inspection process of inspecting the electrical<br>
connection state of the liquid crystal panel 1, inspection can be performed without<br>
problem because an inspection signal need only be input from each inspection pad such<br>
that the various wirings (gate wirings, source wirings, extraction wirings, etc.) reach a<br>
deS1red potential.<br>
10 [0090 ] Specifically, the electrical influence received from adjacent wirings lessens if the<br>
value of the resistanceelements R is from a few dozen to a few hundred megohms. More<br>
specifically, the influence of a change in potential of no more than a few percent (e.g., 1<br>
%) is received. If the change in potential is within a few percent, the influence on display<br>
and the charging rate of the picture element electrodes will be negligible. If the value of<br>
15the resistanceelements R is from a few dozen to a few hundred megohms, operation of an<br>
electronic device will be problem free even in the case where the liquid crystal panel 1<br>
according to the present embodiment is incorporated in the electronic device. If the value<br>
of the resistanceelements R is more than a few hundred megohms, eliminating charge<br>
stored in the wirings and the picture element electrodes after performing the inspection<br>
20 process becomes problematic. As a result, short circuit or disconnection of wirings,<br>
changes in the TFT or MIM characteristics, and the like occur due to the charge stored in<br>
the wirings and the picture element electrodes, and display quality deteriorates.<br>
Therefore, the value of the resistanceelements R preferably is from a few dozen to a few<br>
hundred megohms, as described above. Note that the value of the resistanceelements R<br>
25 is arbitrarily selected from a range of a few dozen to a few hundred megohms, depending<br>
on the S1ze of the display region 4 and the pixel count.<br>
[0091 ] S1nce a resistanceelement R is connected to each of the right-side gate<br>
connecting wirings 641 to 647, invaS1on of static electricity into the display region 4 can be<br>
prevented as a result of the resistanceelements R functioning as a protective element<br>
30 against static electricity, in the case where static electricity invades from the first right-<br>
side gate inspection wiring 66 or the second right-side gate inspection wiring 67. The<br>
display quality of the liquid crystal panel 1 thereby improves, as does the yield of liquid<br>
 <br>
crystal panels.<br>
[0092 ] Note that the value of the resistanceelements R connected to the first right-side<br>
gate connecting wirings 641, 643, 645 and 647 and the value of the resistanceelements R<br>
connected to the second right-side gate connecting wirings 642, 645 and 646 preferably are<br>
5 substantially the same. That is, if the values of the resistanceelements R respectively<br>
connected to adjacent connecting wirings are substantially the same, the delay amounts of<br>
inspection signals to be input to extraction wirings corresponding to adjacent connecting<br>
wirings and to gate wirings corresponding to the extraction wirings will be substantially<br>
equivalent. If the wirings on the active matrix substrate 2 are normal, substantially<br>
10 equivalent display will be performed on the display screen of the liquid crystal panel 1.<br>
In other words, if substantially equivalent display is not performed, the inspector is able to<br>
detect a failure that, while not resulting in disconnection, occurs in cases such as when the<br>
wiring width is extremely small.<br>
[0093 ] Note that while an example in which a resistanceelement is connected to each of<br>
15 two mutually adjacent connecting wirings was described in Embodiment 2, the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto. That is, the resistanceelements need only be connected<br>
to at least one of mutually adjacent connecting wirings.<br>
[0094 ] Also, in Embodiments 1 and 2, an example was described in which common<br>
electrodes are formed on the opposing substrate and a common voltage is applied to the<br>
20 common electrodes on the opposing substrate, but the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto. For example, the present invention can, naturally, also be applied to an IPS (In-<br>
Plane Switching) mode liquid crystal panel in which common electrodes are formed on an<br>
active matrix substrate. Here, transfer pads need not be formed on the active matrix<br>
substrate of an IPS mode liquid crystal panel. The present invention can, naturally, also<br>
25 be applied to an MVA (Multi-Domain Vertical Aligned) mode liquid crystal panel, an<br>
OCB (Optically Compensated Bend) mode liquid crystal panel, or the like.<br>
[0095 ] Also, in Embodiments 1 and 2, an example was described in which R source<br>
wirings, G source wirings and B source wirings are formed in the display region, but the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto. That is, R gate wirings, G gate wirings and B<br>
30gate wirings may be formed in the display region. In this case, source wirings need not be<br>
provided per RGB.<br>
[0096 ] Also, there may be a plurality of colors corresponding to pixels connected to<br>
 <br>
each gate wiring, and there may be a plurality of colors corresponding to pixels connected<br>
to each source wiring.<br>
[0097 ] Also, the arrangement of the pixels in the display region is not limited to a stripe<br>
pattern. For example, a so-called delta arrangement whereby the dispoS1tion pitch shifts<br>
5 every line may be applied.<br>
[0098 ] Also, the method of inputting inspection signals to the gate wirings and the<br>
source wirings is not limited to those illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 5. Inspection signals may<br>
be input to a gate wiring or a source wiring from an inspection pad via a switching<br>
element such as a TFT. Also, the driving circuit of the gate wirings and the source<br>
10wirings may be formed directly on the active matrix substrate. This driving circuit may<br>
be driven at the time of inspection.<br>
[0099 ] Further, in Embodiments 1 and 2, an example was described in which inspection<br>
pads are formed on the active matrix substrate, but the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto. For example, a configuration may be adopted in which the inspection pads are<br>
15 formed on a different substrate from the active matrix substrate, and only inspection<br>
wirings to which inspection signals supplied from the inspection pads can be input are<br>
formed on the active matrix substrate.<br>
[0100 ] That is, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the abovementioned<br>
embodiments and various modifications are posS1ble within the scope defined by the<br>
20 claims. In other words, embodiments combining technical means appropriately modified<br>
within the scope defined by the claims are encompassed in the technical scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
25[0101 ] As described above, the present invention is useful as an active matrix substrate,<br>
a display device, a method for inspecting an active matrix substrate, and a method for<br>
