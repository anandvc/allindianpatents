				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an organic formulation for decontamination of chemical agents, comprising sodium ethoxide, sodium amino ethoxide, sodium ethoxy ethanol and balance being alcohols..<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for preparing such a formulation, which neutralizes the chemical agents within a few minutes.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention<br>
Quick elimination of the adverse effects appeared due to the contamination occurred owing to chemical attack presents a terrible challenge for the military troops and those who care the civilian population. An effective decontamination solution can solve this problem and neutralize the contamination when sprayed thereby making the environment safer to be in. According to Yu-Chu Yang, James A. Baker, J. R. Ward. Decontamination of chemical warfare agents. Chem. Rev. 92 (8) (1992) 1729 - 1743, several decontamination formulations have been introduced so far and can be classified in to two groups. One group include the inert sorbent materials which can remove the hazardous substances from the contaminated surface by physical adsorption, however, they do not detoxify the agents. Second include the formulations which include the active ingredients that chemically react with the agents/hazardous substances and render them non toxic. These decontaminants are useful in battle field conditions and also useful in destroying the toxic agents in relation to chemical weapon convention. The first decontaminant unleashed during the time of first world war is the bleaching powder in aqueous solution which vigorously reacts with the chemical warfare agents and convert them in to non toxic oxidation and elimination products.<br>
However, negligible solubility of sulphur mustard in aqueous solutions hindered the complete decontamination of HD. Yet, Reference may be made to US patent 2,351,924,<br><br>
wherein Carnauh et. al., have improved the formulation by adding calcium hypochlorite to<br>
ortho dichlorobenzene. The amount of active chlorine present in the bleaching powder that<br>
is responsible for the above reactions decrease with the storage time and damages many<br>
surfaces owing to its corrosiveness.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patents 2,921,031 and 2,931,844, wherein to avoid these<br>
problems, researches have developed certain N-chloro compounds as per and have utilized<br>
decontamination applications. They react with the contaminants like sulphur mustard and<br>
convert it in to non-toxic products like divinyl sulphone and sulphoxide.<br>
Following this, peroxo compounds, perborates, oxone etc., have been utilized for the<br>
decontamination of mustard, as per US Patent Number 4,850,729 (1989) ; US Patent<br>
Number 6,245,957 (2001); US Patent Number 5,710,358 (1998).<br>
In addition to these, alkali salts such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium<br>
hydroxides have been introduced to neutralize the nerve gases like sarin according to J. M.<br>
Harris, M. S. Pailey, M. R. Sedaghat-Herati, S. P. Mcmanus. J.Org. Chem. 50 (1985) 5230 ;<br>
R. L. Gustafson, A. E. Martel. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 84 (1962) 2309-2316; J. R. Ward, Y.-C.<br>
Yang, R. B. Wilson, W. D. Burrows, L. L. Ackerman. Bio Org Chem. 16 (1988) 12- 16.<br>
These chemicals react with sarin (isopropyl methyl phosphono fluoridate) and convert it in<br>
to non toxic product called methyl phosphonic acid as per J. Epstein, V. E. Bauer, M. Saxe,<br>
M. M. Demek. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 78 (1956) 4068-4071.<br>
Thereafter, decontaminants based on hypochlorite ion have been introduced to neutralize<br>
both sulphur mustard and sarin. These ions act as catalyst species and facilitate the faster<br>
decontamination of sulphur mustard and sarin as per Yu-Chu Yang, James A. Baker, J. R.<br>
Ward. Decontamination of chemical warfare agents. Chem. Rev. 92 (8) (1992) 1729 - 1743<br>
and J. Epstein, V. E. Bauer, M. Saxe, M. M. Demek. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 78 (1956) 4068-<br>
4071.<br>
Another well known and widely used decontamination formulation is DS 2. It was<br>
introduced in 1960 by US army and contains 70 percent diethylene triamine, 28 percent<br><br>
ethylene glycol mono methyl ether and 2 percent sodium hydroxide. Reactive component in DS 2, CH3OCH2CH20" neutralizes sulphur mustard by stripping the two molecules of hydrochloric acid thereby forming non toxic divinyl sulphide. It also reacts with nerve agents like sarin by attacking P-F bond and converts it to non toxic phosphonic acid. Although it effectively decontaminates most of the chemical warfare agents, it degrades on contact with and exposure to carbon dioxide. It is also corrosive to human skin and personnel handling the DS 2 need to wear protective gear to avoid skin contact and to avoid inhalation of its vapor as per US Patent Number 3079346 (1960) and W. T. Beaudry, L. L. Szafraniec, D. R. Leslie. Reactions of CW agents in DS2. In proceedings of the 1990 CRDEC scientific conference on chemical defense research, CRDEC; Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, November 1990.<br>
Besides this, US army have formulated an all purpose decontaminant called CD-I which contains 55 percent mono ethanolamine, 45 percent 2-hydroxy-l-propyl amine and 2.5 percent lithium hydroxide by weight. Although it reacts with most of the agents, neutralization is not faster and complete relative to DS 2 [12]. In 1992 Yang el al. have reported that strong bases like alkoxide can detoxify the chemical warfare agents in a similar manner as DS 2.<br>
In order to avoid the drawbacks and associated problems as discussed in the above referred prior arts, we have developed an organic formulation based on amino alkoxides and alcoholates of sodium along with relatively lesser amount of amine for the decontamination of toxic chemical warfare agents such as sulphur mustard and sarin. Although some of the components like diethylene triamine and monoethanol amine (other components were not reported) that are used in the present composition were already reported in DS 2 and CD 1, we have replaced the use of sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide by sodium metal to generate alkoxides. These alkoxides work as conjugate bases and play prominent role in the occurrence of detoxification reactions of the agents.<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only exemplary embodiment and without intending to be understood as exemplary teaching of the invention and not to be taken restrictively.<br>
The present invention explores an organic formulation which easily dissolves the chemical agents and decontaminates them at room temperature. Also, the formulation contains minimum or negligible amount of noxious substances. The chemical agents which are decontaminated by the formulation of present invention are agents like sulphur mustard (HD) and sarin (GB). The decontamination time is a very shorter period of time, i.e. just a few minutes. The formulation can be easily sprayed on contaminated surfaces and can be washed after the neutralization of the hazardous substances. The devised organic formulation is very effective and decontaminates the above said agents within a few minutes of time.<br>
It is hereby stated that ingredients of the formulation are interacting synergistically and not reacting chemically, to render exceptional results and property. The formulation is therefore not an admixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of sodium ethoxide is from 2 to 6 percent, sodium amino ethoxide is from 6 to 10 percent and sodium ethoxy ethanol is from 1 to 4 percent and the balance being alcohols selected from absolute alcohol, aminoalcohol, 2-ethoxyethanol or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of absolute alcohol is from 25 to 35<br>
percent by weight.<br>
In  a further embodiment of the invention,  said  amino  alcohol  is  preferably  mono<br>
ethanolamine, from 25 to 35 percent by weight.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, 2-ethoxy ethanol is from 5 to 15 percent by<br>
weight.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention is a process to prepare the organic formulation for<br>
decontamination of chemical agents, wherein said process comprises the steps of:<br>
•	mixing absolute alcohol, amino alkoxide and amino alcohol into a reaction chamber<br>
equipped with means to avoid contact with moisture,<br>
•	stirring and cooling the reaction mixture of step (a) at a temperature of 0 to 4 degree<br>
C for 15 to 20 minutes,<br>
•	adding sodium slowly and carefully to the solution of step (b) while maintaining the<br>
reaction mixture at a temperature of 0 to 4 degree C and allowing the reaction<br>
mixture to react for 6 to 8 hours in presence of a catalyst,<br>
•	stirring the reaction mixture of step (c) for 30 minutes and storing it in an air tight<br>
container to obtain desired organic formulation.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the means to avoid contact with moisture is a<br>
calcium chloride trap.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of sodium is from 3 to 8 percent by<br>
weight.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the catalyst used is preferably diethylene<br>
triamine, from 20 to 30 percent by weight.<br>
The decontaminant organic formulation is prepared as follows:<br>
25 to 35 g of absolute ethanol, 5 to 15 g of 2-ethoxy ethanol and 25 to 35 g of amino ethanol<br>
was added in to a 250 ml round bottom flask equipped with calcium chloride trap in order to<br><br>
avoid the contact with moisture. The mixture was stirred in an ice bath for 15 minutes and then 3 to 8.0 g sodium was carefully added to it while keeping the flask in cold conditions and allowed to react for 6 to 8 hours. After ensuring the complete consumption of sodium, 20 to 30 g of diethylene triamine was added to it and stirred for 60 minutes and stored in an air tight bottle or flask prior to the decontamination studies.<br>
In order to investigate the decontamination of HD and GB, 20 ul either HD or sarin was added to 980 ul of decontamination solution by means of micropipette. After a few minutes, (1 to 5 minutes), 2 ml of dicholomethane was added to the above reaction mixture and stirred vigorously for 20 seconds to facilitate the extraction of unreacted HD or sarin into dichloromethane phase. The dicholomethane phase was transferred to another test tube containing the dried magnesium sulphate to remove the water.<br>
Resulted solutions were subjected to GC-FID analysis using temperature programme. For sarin, temperature programme was performed between 40 and 210 degree C at a rate of 20 degree C on a BP-5 column with 0.5 urn thickness, 1 mm outer diameter and 30 meter length. While for HD, temperature programme between 50 and 210 degree C at a rate of 40 degree C on OV17 packed stainless steel column of 1 meter length was used. Injector and detector ports were maintained at 220 and 230 degree C for both HD and sarin. GC data illustrating the HD decontamination is shown in figure 1 and it shows the data of HD standard (Figure l(a)) and reaction mixture extracted after 1 minute (figure l(b)). As per the data, eluted HD appears as peak at 7.0 minute and it was found to disappear in the reaction mixture extracted after 1 minute of treatment of 20 ul with 980 ul decontamination solution thus showing decontamination of HD. Sarin (Figure 2) eluted as peak at 3.24 minutes (figure 2a) and it disappeared after 1 minutes of reaction (Figure 2 b). Developed decontamination solution was found to decontaminate HD and sarin with 100 percent decontamination efficiency in a few of the minutes. The decontamination of sulphur mustard and sarin with the formulation of present invention<br><br>
takes place in the following manner:<br>
(Sulphur mustard)	(Divinyl sulphide)<br>
C4H10FO2P	•	CH3O3PRR1<br>
(Sarin)	(Substituted product, where R and R' can be selected<br>
from C2H5O, C2H5OCH2CH2O, H2NCH2CH2O)<br>
