HISTONE DE ACETYLASE INHIBITORS OF NOVEL BENZAMIDE<br>
BEJUVAITVE5 WITH POTENT DIFFERENTIATION AND<br>
ANTl-FROLTFERATION ACTIVITY<br>
Priority is indicated herein from U.S, Provisional Application Set. No. 60/447,915, filed<br>
February 14,2003-<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation and use of novel beuzamids derivatives<br>
as histone deacctylase inbibitors for treatments of differentiation- and/or<br>
proliferation-related disorders such as cancer and psoriasis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aberrant expression of genes plays significant roles in pathogenesis or pathological<br>
alterations in cancer, endotrine-related disorders, immuue/inflammatory diseases,<br>
genetic diseases, and neurological diseases, The human genome is packaged into<br>
chicmatin that consists of DNA, hiatones and non-histone proteins- Chromatin structure<br>
is an important factor in determining whether a particular gene is expressed or cot. In<br>
general, condensed chromatin mediates tanscriptional repression, whereas<br>
transcriptic-nally active genes are in areas of open chromatin. Nuclcosomes form the<br>
basic repeating unit of chromatin, and consist of DNA wrapped around a histone<br>
octomer that is formed by four histone partners namely an H3-H4 tetramer and two<br>
H2A-H2B dimmers. Histone H1 acts like a linker to stabilize the higher-order folding<br>
by electrostatic neutralization of the linker DNA segments through a positively charged<br>
carboxy-terminsl domain. Therefore, the dynamic higker-order stnueture of<br>
nucleosomes defines distinct levels of chromatin organization and consequently, gene<br>
activation. Ricky W, Johnstone, "Histone deacetylase inhibitors; novel drugs for the<br>
treatment of cancer". Nature Reviews -Drug Discovey 2002, I; 287.   The capacity of<br><br>
WO2004/071400	PCT/IB2004/000401<br>
2<br>
histon octomer to compact DNA is infhrencsd by a number of post-translational<br>
modifications that occur on the N-tetramal histone tails. One modification involves the<br>
reversible acetylation and deacetylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine moieties<br>
found within the histono tails. The net level of acetylation of N-terminal histone tails is<br>
controlled by the activities of two families of enzymes, the histone acetyltransfcrasea<br>
(HATs) and histons deatetylasca (HDACs). In addition to HATs and HDACs, other<br>
factors also participate in determination of chromatin structure including<br>
methyl-CpG-binding protein and adenosine triphosphate-depedent<br>
chromatin/reinodeling complexes -that can directly recruit HDAC3, which leads to<br>
repression of gene activation (see review Current Opinion in Oncology 2001,<br>
13:477-483).<br>
The identification of coactivator complexes that possess intrinsic HAT activity strongly<br>
supports the connection between histone acetylation and transcriptional activation.<br>
Similarly, transcriptional represser complexes have been shown to recruit HDACs to<br>
the promoter of target genes (Bioassays 1998 20:615). Sequence-specific transcription<br>
factors, such as nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, cyclic adenosine 3',<br>
5'-monophasphate-related enhancer binding protein (CREB), and signal transducer and<br>
activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1), interact with distinct coactivitors and<br>
corepressors inside the complex of transcriptional machinery in a. DNA-context and<br>
tissus-context selective fashion, resulting in selective regulartion of gene expression<br>
networks. These regulatory networks govern homeostasis of our body's physiological<br>
functions and perturbation of those networks causes disorders and/or profoundly affects<br>
progression of diseases. Therefore, modulation of complex interactions of transcription<br>
machincfy provides novel intervention strategies for the treatments of cancer,<br>
endocrine-related disorders, immune/inflaunrnatory diseases, genetic diseases, and<br>
neurodegeneration (Karzus, E-, et al., Transcription Factor-spccific Requirements for<br><br>

For instance, cell development and difierentiation are governed by the hierarchical<br>
order of sequsatial gene activation, which is controlled at the level of  chromatin<br>
structure,  Genetic alterations  or mutations that cause  constitutive activation of<br>
oncoproteins such as RAS, or inactivation of inmor suppressors such as p53, affect a<br>
myriad of molecular programs, including transcription. In addition, genetic<br>
abnormalities that result in improper targeting of HATs and HDACs ta certain loci,<br>
functional inactivntion of HATs overexpression of HDACs or epigenetic changes due<br>
to DKA hyper- and hyporaethylation, can shift balance between cell development and<br>
differential programs that often lead to turnor onset and progression (see review<br>
Current Opinion Genet Development 1999, 9: 40-48 and 175-184). Several human<br>
cancers have been associated with malfunctions in HAT and KDAC activity. One<br>
example is the translocadon of chromosomes 15 and 17 seen in the majority of acute<br>
promyelacytic leukemia (APL) patients. In APL, chromosomal translocations produce<br>
5 fusion proteins that contain RARalpha,  (promyelocytic leukaemia protein), and<br>
PLZF (promyelocytic zinc finger). These aberrant proteins bind to retinoic acid<br><br>
WO2004/071400	PCT/IB2004/000401<br>
4<br>
response elements, recruit HDACs with high affinity through enhanced binding for<br>
SMRT corepressor and are not responsive to retinoids, resulting in the constitutive<br>
repression of RAR-targeted genes (Oncogene 2001, 20:7204-7215). Retinold acid<br>
receptor (RAR) is a ligand-activated transcriptional modulator that is important for<br>
myeloid differentiation. RAR heterodimerized with its partner RXR binds to retinoid<br>
acid response element, located in promoter region of target genes, and in the absence of<br>
retinoids, represses transcription by recruiting SIN3/HDAC through NCOR and SMRT<br>
compressors. Addition of ligand releases the HDAC complexes from RAR/RXR, and<br>
allows subssquent binding of HATs, such as TIF2 and CBP, to activate transcription.<br>
Therefore, the coordinated activation and repression of genes that contain functional<br>
retinoid acid response elements is essential to myeloid cell differentiation. Furthermore,<br>
addition of HDAC inhibitors can restore sensitivity of APL calls to retinoid-induced<br>
myeloid cell differentiation, indicating that aberrant bistone deacetylation is a key<br>
process in leukaemogenesis.<br>
There ate reports that historic deacetylaaes, when overexpressed, silenco the expression<br>
of tumor suppressor genes that are natnral brakes against tumor growth. For example,<br>
p53, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, transmits signals to genes that control the<br>
cell cycle and apoptosis when cells ara under stress. The functions are principally<br>
controlled by the ability of p53 to bind to DNA with sequence-specificity and to<br>
activate transcription, Inactivation of this property of p53, mostly by mutations that<br>
occur in the central DNA-binding domain, often leads to malignancy. It bas been<br>
demonstrated that CBP/p300 can up-regulate p53 through core histone acetylation and<br>
p53 acetylation, (W. Gu and RG Roeder, Activation of p53 Sequence-Specific DNA<br>
Binding by Acetylation of the p53 C-Terminal Domain, Cell I997t 90(4); 595-606,)<br>
Conversely, mammnalian HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and HDAC-3 are shown to be capable of<br>
downregulating p53 function by deacetylation of both core bistone and p53 (Juan, L.-L,<br><br>
WO2004/071400	PCT/IB2004/000401<br>
5<br>
el al., Histane Deacetylases Specifically Down-regnlato p53-depeadent Gene<br>
Activation. The Journal of Biological Chemistry 2000,275(27): 20436-20443).<br>
These data show that inappropriate transcriptional repression mediated by HDACs is a<br>
common molecular mechanism that is used by oncoproteins, and alterations in<br>
chromatin structure can impinge on normal cellular differentiation, which, leads to<br>
tumor formation and otter hyperpniliferative disorders. Therefore, the inhibition of<br>
HDAC activity seems to be a rational therapeutic pathway for cancers and other<br>
hypeiprolifcrative diseases,<br>
Several classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified, including (1) short-chain fatty<br>
acids, e.g. bntyrate and phenylbutyrate; (2) organic hydroxamic acids, e,g.<br>
suberaylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin A (TSA); (3) cyclic<br>
tetrapeptides containing a 2-amino-8-oxo 9,10-expoxydecanoyl (AOE) moiety, e.g.<br>
tratpoxin and HC-toxin; (4) cyclic peptides without the AOE moiety, e.g. apicidin and<br>
FK228; and (5) benzamidss, e.g. MS-275 (BPO847992A1, US2002/0103192A1,<br>
WO02/26696Al, WO010/675A2, WO01/18171A2).<br>
Butyric acid acts as an inhibitor of cell proliferation and an inducer of<br>
cytodifferentiation due primarily to its activity of inhibiting histone deacetylase, (A.<br>
Nudelman and A. Rephaeli, Novel Mutual Prodrug of Retinoic and Butyric Acids win<br>
Enhanced Anticancar Activity. j. Med. Chem, 2000, 43(15): 2962-2966)<br>
Phenylbutyrate has been used as a single agent in the treatment of p-thalassemia,<br>
toxoplasmnosis, and mnlarie. It is also repotted to be successful in treating refractory<br>
APL in combination with RA (retinoid acid). (R.P, 'Warrell ct al., Therapeutic targeting<br>
of transcription in acuta promyelocytic leukemia by use of an inhibitor of histone<br>
deacetyiase, J, Nat! Cancer Tnst.  1998, 90(21): 1621-1625,) Another fetty acid,<br><br>

valproic acid, which is a potent anticonvulsant, mood stabilizer and tcratogen, is also a<br>
direct inhibitor of histont deacetylase, (C.J, Phiel et al., Histone Deacetylase Is a Direct<br>
Target ofValproic Acid, a Potent Anticohvulsant, Mood Stabilizer, and Teratogen. The<br>
Journal of Biological Chemistry 2001,276(39); 36734-36741; EP1170008Al).<br>
A set of benzamides was discovered to have HDAC inhibitory activity in the low<br>
rnicromolar range. A lead compound, MS-275, from this set of benzanrides is being<br>
tested by Milsui Chemicals, Inc. and it is the first HDAC inhibitor to demonstrate oral<br>
anticancer activity in animal models with no severe side effects. (A. Saito et al, A<br>

activity against human tumors. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the<br>
Umted States of America I999t 96(6): 4592-4597; RP 0847992 AI). MS-275 is<br>
currently under clinical trials in the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center<br>
for leukemia patients and by the US. National Cancer Institute for advanced solid<br>
i tumors. (E.B. Levit, Clinical Triala in Leukemia focus on New Treatment Approaches.<br>

with, improved profiles, such as stronger HDAC inhibitory activity,<br>
