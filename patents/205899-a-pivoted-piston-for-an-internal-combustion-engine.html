Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
The prior art piston 10 disclosed in WO 95/08055 and illustrated in Figure I is pivoted within a combustion chamber (not shown in the drawings) by a pivot pin 14 and has as an arcuate first sealing surface 12 which forms a skirt to the piston. The prior an piston also includes a second arcuate sealing surface 13 which is radially offset from the skirt 12 with both the surface of the skirt and the second arcuate sealing surface describing a circumferential path about the pivot pin 14. The piston includes a piston pin 11 to receive an end of a connecting rod (not shown in the drawing), by which the crankshaft of the engine is rotated. The piston illustrated in Figure 1 also includes a sealing groove 15 incorporated in the arcuate surface 12 to receive a sealing means to allow the arcuate surface 12 to be gas sealed to a wall of a combustion chamber (not shown in the drawings). The second arcuate sealing surface 13 will also form a gas seal against a corresponding wall of a second chamber also not shown in the drawings. The piston includes side grooves 16 to receive seals which will seal against the sides of the combustion chamber.<br>
The improved piston, particularly as illustrated in Figures 2 through 8 provides an improved seal design which will aid combustion gas tightness as well as simplifying the manufacturing process. The prior art piston as illustrated particularly in Figure I was generally manufactured in one piece with side seals located at each side of the piston and a<br><br>
seal at the leading edge of the first arcuate surface. These seals were retained in a seal slot 15 (see Figure 1) which was set back from the piston inner radial surface 13 and in seal slots 16 at the sides of the piston. This sealing design requires the seal slot 15 to extend beyond the side surfaces of the head into the side of the piston to accommodate the seals which are located in the head and extend around the outer edge of the inner radial piston surface to meet with the side seals.<br>
The above form of sealing of the piston against the combustion chamber wall presents various manufacturing problems and to overcome the requirement for the seal slot 15 to extend beyond the side of the piston component and into the side inner plate surface it is necessary to seal the chamber at the corner formed by the intersection of the piston radial surface and the side surface.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 2 through 9^ the construction of the sealing surface 13 of Figure 1 has been modified. The seal is now composed of a sliding surface - see particularly Figures 3, 6, 7 and 8. The sealing surface comprises a bed 20 which extends from the floor 21 of the piston in a direction radial to the pivot axis 14. The bed is suitably reinforced by gussets 17 (see Figure 4) to provide adequate rigidity to the structure. Preferably the bed 20 includes cut outs 23 (see Figures 9 and 10) separated by a bridge 32.<br>
In the version illustrated the sliding seals (see particularly Figures 7 and 8) comprise two arcuate sealing components 24 which may be substantially similar. The components include tongues 25 which can locate in grooves 26 formed in the bed 20 of the sealing<br><br>
surface. The rear surface of the components 24 is shaped to engage closely over the bed 20 and the tongues 25 will locate in the grooves 26 in a manner that the components will be retained in the grooves 26 but can have limited transverse movement within the grooves 26.<br>
Each arcuate sealing component has a mating face which is preferably formed of a meshing surface such as that illustrated at 28 in Figures 7 and 8. One preferred form of meshing surface which is illustrated is in the shape of an interlocking sine wave. The purpose of the meshing surface is to allow the two sealing components to have independent transverse movement on the seal bed 20 but place a restriction in the path of combustion gases through the mating feces at the junction of the two components. It will be understood that other shapes of meshing surface can also be employed and the particular configuration illustrated is provided only as an example of one form of a meshing surface.<br>
The seal components 24 are formed of a highly wear resistant material or have highly wear resistant surfaces and in particular the side edges 30 of the seal components are formed to provide a sealing surface against the sides of the combustion chamber. To ensure an adequate seal the components are preferably spring loaded to urge the edges 30 of the components 24 against the wall of the combustion chamber. One preferred form of attaining this object is by way of a tension spring 31 - see particularly Figures 7 and 9. The spring 31 is formed of spring steel in an essentially U shape and is located in a hole formed in the gusset 15 behind the bridge 32 of the piston. Various methods of anchoring the legs of the spring to the seal components can be utilised.   One highly preferred form is to engage the ends of the<br><br>
legs of the spring in holes formed in the rear surface of the seal components 24 as illustrated in the drawings.<br>
It will be understood that while the sliding seal is illustrated as being composed of two components, this is a preferred configuration only and more than two components can be utilised as required with appropriate sealing surfaces 28 between each component. The break line between the two components is formed into interlocking surfaces to ensure thermal expansion of the component parts will not result in an excessive gap at the break line where pressure leakage could otherwise occur. It is to be understood that the form of the interlocking surface is a preferred form only and various configurations that will attain the desired object of providing a gas seal through the joint are contemplated as will be apparent to those skilled in this art.<br>
The purpose of the tension spring 30 is to preload the components of the sliding seal outwardly to thereby assist in maintaining a sealing contact between the sides of the seal components against the sides of the combustion chamber.<br>
A further advantage arising through the use of the sliding seal components is that the sealing surface 13 is now composed of components which are separate from the piston component and can therefore be manufactured separately from the piston. The components are restrained from moving under centrifugal force by the use of the retaining grooves 26 in the bed 20 of the piston. Should wear occur on the faces of the sliding seal components, then it will be a simple matter to remove and replace the components.<br><br>
A further benefit resulting from the modification is that the same seal component will mate with both the seal located in the head and the side wall plate inner surface. The chamber sealing line around the piston intersects at a point where the inner radiaLsealing surface meets the side wall of the chamber. A seal housing is therefore not required in the inner surface of the chamber side wall plate because the sealing of the piston at the two sides of the inner radial piston surface is not set back from the inner radial piston surface.<br>
A yet further benefit is that the arced surface of the sealing means is not distorted from thermal expansion because it is not an integral part of the piston and can therefore expand uniformly. This ensures that a good straight sealing surface is retained upon which the seal can maintain good sealing contact with the wall of the chamber.<br>
Si<br>
A still further benefit is that the sliding seal components are replaceable components. This facilitates the manufacture of the piston since it will overcome difficulties in grinding the piston inner arced surface because this component can be surface ground on a rotating mandrel.<br>
The improvement also includes a modified skirt for the piston, a preferred embodiment of which is illustrated in Figures 10 through 13.<br>
The skirt 40 is shaped so when it is attached to the piston, it will have an outer surface 41 which describes a circumferential path from the pivot axis 14. The skirt (see more particularly Figures 13a, 13b and 13c is essentially rectangular in shape and at one transverse<br><br>
edge is formed into a tongue 42 which will be a neat fit in the locating groove 43 (see Figure 3) formed in the front wall of the piston below the floor 21 of the piston. The second transverse edge of the skirt is preferably shaped into a roll formation 45 to provide a flange 46 which will bear on lugs 47 (see also Figure 3 and 4) of the piston. The flange 44 is attached to the lugs 47 by rivets (not shown in the drawings) to securely locate the lower edge of skirt to the piston. Because of the flexibility of the roll formation 45, the skirt is able to float partly out of the locating groove 43 and this enables good sealing contact to be made with the wall of the combustion chamber. Should the skirt require replacement for any reason, then it is a simple matter to remove the rivets and lift the tongue 42 out of the locating groove 43.<br>
In the configuration of the engine as disclosed in European Patent Specification WO 95/08055, the main function of the skirt in the piston is to seal off the exhaust port from the primary induction chamber when the piston is at the top dead centre position. A skirt is also effective in transmitting heat away from the piston crown area. While the prime function of the skirt of the known round pistons is to restrain thrust loads, this is not a requirement of the piston disclosed in the European Specification 95/08055 and it is therefore possible to make the skirt as a separate and essentially floating component. The advantage in making the skirt as a separate component as disclosed herein is that it can be made to move outwardly from the piston component to meet with the surface of the combustion chamber and retain a consistent contact irrespective of whether the piston is hot or cold. This will compensate for expansion of the piston and ensure good sealing of the primary induction chamber from the exhaust port.   Heat is transferred from the front edge of the piston into the combustion<br><br>
chamber wall through the floating outer radial skirt. This is achieved because the floating skirt will retain a direct contact with both the piston and the cooled surface of the combustion chamber throughout a range of piston thermal expansion. In addition, because the skirt can be a replaceable component, manufacture of the piston is simplified.<br>
While the skirt 40 is described as having one transverse edge formed into a tongue 42 and the second transverse edge as being shaped into a roll formation 45, it is to be understood these are highly preferred methods of attaching the skirt to the piston. Other methods of attaching the skirt to the piston as will be apparent to those skilled in the art can be utilised, with the main requirement being that the skirt is securely attached to the piston and yet has a desired degree of float in relation to the piston and be readily removable and replaceable is that should be required.<br>
It is also possible to liquid cool the piston by forming a liquid coolant path through the pivot shaft. The coolant can be circulated into the piston by way of the pivot shaft and then pass through piston cooling galleries and be discharged through the other end of the pivot shaft. The liquid cooling has important benefits in the potential to remove heat from the piston at a rate which will enable the engine to be run at high loads for prolonged periods. An ancillary advantage of the potential for liquid cooling is in engines designed for aircraft operation because this will enable a good margin of safety into the safe full load operation time limit. It will also reduce the clearance necessary for thermal expansion when fitting the piston into the engine.<br><br>
A yet further modification of the piston is the location of the side seals in the piston. It is known for instance to use a pin in conventional piston grooves to ensure that the piston ring does not rotate in the groove. This is particularly important when an inlet or exhaust port is formed in the wall of the combustion chamber to prevent the possibility of the piston ring moving in the ring groove to a position where the gap in the piston ring can register with the port in the wall of the combustion chamber. In the case of the present invention as illustrated more particularly in Figures 2 and 14 a restraining pin 60 is utilised to restrain the horizontal side seals 62 from moving under the action of centrifugal force created by the arced path of the pistoa The restraining pins 60 in the horizontal side seal 62 register with a matching groove 63 formed on the inner edge of the seal to restrain the centrifugal load of the side seal from bearing on the outer ends of the front seaL A further function of the side seal restraining pin 60 is to close the pressure escape path from behind the horizontal side seal. The pin 60 effects this because it is located at the rear of the seal groove 63 on the pivot side of the combustion chamber sealing area. The horizontal side seal 62 therefore fits snugly around the restraining pin 60 so the gas leakage path behind the seal is blocked.<br>
Having read the specification, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and amendments can be made to the construction and yet still come within the general concept of the invention. All such modifications and changes are intended to be included within the scope of this application.<br><br>
