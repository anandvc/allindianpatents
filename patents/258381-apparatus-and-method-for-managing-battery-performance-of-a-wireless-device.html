APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR MANAGING BATTERY PERFORMANCE OF A WIRELESS DEVICE<br>
CLAM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/665,435 entitled "Methods And Apparatus For Providing Battery Performance<br>
Information In A Wireless Device," Attorney Docket No. 050471P1, filed March 25,<br>
2005, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	The described  embodiments generally relate to wireless  communications<br>
devices and computer networks. More particularly, the described embodiments relate to<br>
apparatus and methods for determining battery performance characteristics of a wireless<br>
device, along with the collection, reporting and analysis of battery performance data<br>
from the wireless device.<br>
[0003]	Wireless networking connects one or more wireless devices to other computer<br>
devices without a direct electrical connection, such as a copper wire or optical cable. Wireless devices communicate data, typically in the form of packets, across a wireless or partially wireless computer network and open a "data" or "communication" channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The wireless devices often have wireless device resources, such as programs and hardware components, which individually and cooperatively operate to use and generate data in accordance to their design and specific protocol or configuration, such as using open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network.<br>
[0004]	The battery performance in these wireless devices is critical for their portability.<br>
The battery must not only provide hours of service, but also normally must be rechargeable. Further, the wireless network services providers and/or the manufacturer of the wireless devices often make claims and/or warranties relating to the battery performance, e.g. a network service provider may claim that a particular wireless device has seventy (70) hours of idle time or nine (9) hours of talk time. The wireless network services providers also have a strong incentive for the performance of the batteries to be optimum so that their customers can purchase services from them. Problems with battery performance are particularly exacerbated because there may be millions of units<br><br>
WO 2006/104947                                                 	PCT/US2006/010956<br>
of a particular wireless device or component in use, and because people have become so dependent on wireless devices that they demand that the device be immediately repaired. Thus, the wireless network service providers would like to monitor battery performance to insure that the battery performance of the wireless device is within the promised standards, and further the wireless service providers would like to be able to quickly diagnose and repair substandard battery performance.<br>
[0005]	Wireless devices have become increasingly complex being manufactured with<br>
increased computing capabilities. Wireless devices have many components and operations that can affect the battery performance. For example, the following all affect battery performance: displays, transmitting data, game programs, synchronizing contact lists over an additional protocol like Bluetooth®, etc. Further, the wireless devices often have many accessories that can affect the performance of the battery, such as chargers, digital cameras, computer docking ports, etc. With this great complexity, it can be both difficult and expensive to predict the performance of the battery and to trouble-shoot substandard battery performance.<br>
[0006]	In order for the battery performance of the wireless device to operate efficiently<br>
and optimally, and in order to diagnose battery performance problems it would be useful for the data associated with the battery performance to be collected and reported, and for the characteristics of the battery to be calculated with the use of predetermined battery standards.<br>
[0007]	Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide an apparatus and method that<br>
allows for efficient, comprehensive collection and reporting of wireless device battery performance data.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, one embodiment of a system 10 for collecting battery<br>
performance data and analyzing the battery performance characteristics of any one of a plurality of wireless devices 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 in communication with a wireless network 42 includes a resident battery performance module 20 on each device. Each resident battery performance module 20 is operable, according to configuration 62 defined by a battery configurator module 72, which may be remotely located, to collect and transmit selected ones of a plurality of types of battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 across a wireless network 42 to a user manager module 40. For example, battery configurator module 72 dictates what types of battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 to collect, how often to collect the data, and when to report the collected data. Further, battery configurator module 72 may dictate one of a plurality of predetermined test programs 54 and/or test data 56 to execute on the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 in order to generate the battery performance data 76 and the associated data 78 to collect. User manager module 40 stores the transmitted battery performance data 76 and associated data 78, which may be held in a data log 74 along with tracking configuration 62, in a data repository 73 which is accessible by a performance analyzer 70. Performance analyzer 70 examines the collected battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 and generates a battery performance report 60 that characterizes one or more actual battery performance characteristics 62 associated with the respective device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 based on the collected battery performance data 76 and associated data 78. In one embodiment, the collected battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 are compared with predetermined battery standards 50 and/or user-defined battery standards 52. For example, the performance analyzer 70 may compare a selected portion of the actual battery performance data 76, such as the maximum voltage of the battery, to a selected portion of the predetermined battery standards 50, such as the maximum voltage a battery of this type should reach, and using this comparison, derives a battery performance characteristic 62 for battery 16. Further, after performing an initial analysis on an initial set of battery performance data 76, performance analyzer 70 may<br><br>
WO 2006/104947	PCT/US2006/010956<br><br>
initiate further communications with one or more wireless devices 12, 14, 16,17, 18 to retrieve additional battery performance data 76 and associated data 78. Performance analyzer 70 may repeat such a feedback loop until a predetermined solution is achieved, i.e. until the performance analyzer 70 determines there is enough battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 to determine a battery performance characteristics 62.<br>
[0024]	Optionally, user manager module 40 may include an optimization module 82<br>
that analyzes data log 73 and/or battery performance report 60 and generates new configuration settings 68 for a respective wireless to improve battery performance. User manager module 40 may then transfer the updated device configuration settings 68 to the respective wireless device in order to improve the battery performance of the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Examples of a new configuration setting 68 would be lowering the amps used to transmit, or turning off the light on the display more quickly after use. Further, battery performance module 40 may transmit at least a portion of data log 73 and/or battery performance report 60 to either the user of the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 or to another device or entity 43. For example, battery performance report 60 may be sent to a technician, a customer service representative, a carrier, and any third party who may be interested in battery performance information. In an example of report 60 being sent to a network operator module 43, the network operator module 43 may then take further action, such as generating a command for a new battery to be sent to the user of the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, or issuing further commands to user manager module 40 to conduct further tests on the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 or other wireless devices 12,14,16,17,18.<br>
[0025]	Thus, the present apparatus and methods provide for the collection, analysis, and<br>
reporting of predetermined battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 associated with the battery performance capabilities of a wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and allow for troubleshooting and optimization of battery performance related device configuration in order to improve the battery performance of the respective wireless device 12,14,16,17,18.<br>
[0026]	Battery performance data 76 can include any type of operational-related data<br>
associated with the battery or power supply of a wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Battery performance data 76 includes, but is not limited to: battery identification; battery voltage; charging source; charging voltage; charging current; call time; analog or<br><br>
WO 2006/104947	PCT/US2006/010956<br><br>
digital protocol used; protocol type, such as IS-95, CDMA-lx, and, UMTS; sleep time;<br>
low power mode information; battery temperature; change in battery voltage for each<br>
minute of talk time; and (referring to Fig. 2) any battery-related operational data that can<br>
be generated from processing engine 84 during actual operation of the wireless device<br>
12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Associated data 78 can include any type of data, such as the<br>
operational or environmental conditions of the respective device and/or network<br>
corresponding to the collected battery performance data 76. Associated data 78<br>
includes, but is not limited to: current operation of the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17,<br>
18; timestamps; corresponding application information; corresponding protocol<br>
information; subsystem information related to battery performance data 76; and, any<br>
data that can be generated from processing engine 84 during actual operation of the<br>
wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 which is related to, or which can be associated with,<br>
battery performance data 76.<br>
[0027]	Battery performance module 20 may be initiated at any time, and battery<br>
performance data 76 and associated data 78 may be stored on the respective wireless device 12, 14,16, 17,18 and obtained at any time via a wired or wireless connection to the respective wireless device. Battery performance module 20 may include any hardware, software, firmware and/or other set of executable instructions operable to manage the collection on the wireless device, and transmission across the wireless network, of any information relating to the battery performance capabilities of the respective wireless device. Battery performance module 20 collects any battery related battery performance data 76 along with associated data 78 relevant to battery performance data 76. Further, battery performance module 20 may store this information in a data log 74, either in a resident memory or another memory/storage device connectable to the respective wireless device. Further, data log 74 may include the details of tracking/reporting configuration 62 in data log 74 in associated with the collected data. In one embodiment, for example, battery performance module 20 comprises performance data management logic 35, which includes executable instructions for managing receiving and executing configuration 62, collecting and storing battery performance data 76 and/or associated data 78, and providing access to or forwarding log 74 and/or its contents for further analysis. Thus, in one embodiment, battery performance module 20 provides each wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 with a resident or self-contained capability for retrieving and recording battery performance<br><br>
WO 2006/104947		PCT/US2006/010956<br>
data 76 and associated data 78 associated with battery related activities on a wireless device, as well as for allowing the transmission and remote analysis of such battery performance data 76 and associated data 78.<br>
[0028]	Battery performance module 20 may cause the respective wireless device to<br>
selectively transmit battery performance data 76, such as battery voltage, for that wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 to another computer device, such as user manager module 40, on the wireless network 42. In one embodiment, battery performance module 20 transmits battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 from that wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 to user manager 40 across the wireless network 42. Alternatively, battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 is transmitted over an open communication connection from the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 to the wireless network 42, and thus "piggybacked" across an open connection, such as a voice or data call at the cellular telephone 12. In a cellular network configuration, battery performance data 76 and associated data 78, can be transmitted to user manager module 40 through short message service. In another embodiment, a remote user manager module 40 reads battery performance data 76 from the respective device through the resident battery performance module 20, and in some instances, writes commands to computer platform 13 and alters the operation of the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Accordingly, the access to battery performance module 20 allows the user manager module 40 to remotely control parameters for battery performance data collection, then analyze, and report battery performance characteristics.<br>
[0029]	User manager 40 may communicate with wireless devices 12, 14, 16, 17, 18<br>
through a direct, wired connection or through a wireless connection, such as through a network interface 38 in communication with wireless network 42. The communication between user manager module 40 and wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 may include downloads of all, or selected portions (such as data sets), of resident battery performance module 20 that operates within wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Other such communications include uploads from each wireless device 12,14,16,17,18 back to the user manager 40, such as uploads of battery performance data 76, or uploads of battery performance module 20.<br>
[0030]	User manager module 40 may be at least one of any type of server, personal<br>
computer, mini computer, mainframe computer, or any computing device either special purpose or general computing device.   Further, user manager module 40 may reside<br><br>
WO 2006/104947		PCT/US2006/010956<br>
entirely on the wireless device 12, 14,16, 17,18. Further, there can be separate servers or computer devices associated with user manager module 40 that work in concert to provide data in usable formats to parties, and/or a separate layer of control in the data flow between the wireless devices 12,14,16,17,18 and user manager module 40. User manager module 40 (or plurality of modules) can send software agents or applications, such as the resident battery performance module 20, to wireless devices 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 across wireless network 42, such that the respective wireless devices return data from their resident applications and subsystems. For example, wireless devices 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 may transmit data, such as performance data 76, to user manager module 40 or some other computer device on the network in the form of a data log 74. Data log 74 includes the battery performance data 76, as collected based on the configuration received from battery configurator module 72, and also may include other associated data 78. User manager module 40 utilizes data log 74 for analyzing and reporting the battery performance of the respective device, including but not limited to: call time, idle time, battery charger performance, and any battery related characteristic of a wireless device.<br>
[0031]	User manager module 40 and its corresponding components can give a ready<br>
view of data log 74 collected from the wireless devices in any form, such as tables, maps, graphics views, plain text, interactive programs or web pages, or any other display or presentation of the data. For example, user manager module 40 may present data log 74 and/or battery performance report 60 on a monitor or display device, and/or may transmit, such as via electronic mail, this information to another computer device for further analysis or review. Also, user manager module 40 may change an operation parameter and/or configuration setting of a respective wireless device, based on data log 74 and/or based on the results of the performance analyzer 70.<br>
[0032]	User manager 40 includes remote battery performance module 21 to manage<br>
battery performance-related operations. Remote battery performance module 21 may include software, hardware, firmware, and generally any executable instructions operable by user manager module 40. In one embodiment, for example, remote battery performance module 21 comprises data management logic 25, which includes executable instructions for managing generating and transmitting configuration 62, collecting and storing battery performance data 76 and/or associated data 78, and initiating the analysis and optimizations procedures described herein.  Remote battery<br><br>
WO 2006/104947		PCT/US2006/010956<br>
performance module 21 may download all or a portion of the resident version of battery<br>
performance module 20 to each wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18. Alternatively, the<br>
resident version of battery performance module 20 may be loaded onto the respective<br>
wireless device during the initial assembly process or via direct connections during a<br>
configuration process. Further, remote battery performance module 21 is executable by<br>
user manager module 40 to generate battery performance-tracking configuration 62 and<br>

[0045]	As described above, tracking/reporting configuration 62 may include one or<br>
more of selected battery parameter 26 that specifies which of the battery performance-related data available on the cellular device 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 to collect; selected associated   data   parameter   28   that   specifies   which   of   the   correspondingWO 2006/104947			PCT/US2006/010956<br><br>
environmental/operational condition information to collect; selected tracking parameter 30 that specifies how often to collect the data specified in the battery parameter 26 and associated data parameters 28; selected reporting parameters 32 that specifies when to report the collected battery performance data 76 and the associated data 78 to the remote battery performance module 21; selected test program 90 that includes a program or script for processing engine 84 or simulator module 22 to execute; and, selected test data 92 that includes data for processing engine 84 or simulator module 22 to use independently or while executing selected test program 90.

[0046]	Optionally, battery performance module 20 may include a simulator module 22<br>
operable to operate any functionality of the respective wireless device 12,14,16,17,18. For example, simulator module 22 may execute selected test program 90, and may further execute selected test data 92. Selected test program 90 and/or selected test data 92 may include instructions or scripts for the simulator module 22 to operate any functionality of the respective wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, such as to transmit data using FTP, make a call for a specified period of time or until an event occurs, etc. So operable, the system allows for the simulator to function while the battery performance module 20 collects the data specified in configuration 62. For example, the simulator may conduct an actual call on the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, during which the battery performance module records at a predetermined interval, such as every one-tenth (1/10) of a second, a predetermined battery performance parameter, such as the voltage of the battery, and optionally an associated parameter, such as the length of the call,. This data may be used to troubleshoot both the operation of the battery and the battery related operation of transmitter on the wireless device 12,14,16, 17,18.<br>
[0047]	Additionally, computer platform 13 may further include a communications<br>
module 85 embodied in hardware, firmware, software, and combinations thereof, that enables communications among the various components of the respective communications device, as well as between the device and network 42.<br><br>

Battery 16 may include any source of power that permits the wireless device to operate.<br>
[0049]	Referring to Fig. 3, in a cellular telephone embodiment, for example, a cellular<br>
telephone system 92 may include wireless network 42 connected to a wired network 58 via a carrier network 64. The use of cellular telecommunication pathways has been increasing because wireless devices, such as the plurality of cellular telephones 12 illustrated in Fig. 3, are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants ("PDAs"), communicating packets including voice and data over wireless network 42. These "smart" cellular telephones 12 have APIs 34 on their local computer platform 13 that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone, and control certain functionality on the device. Fig. 3 is a representative diagram that more fully illustrates the components of a cellular wireless network and the interrelation of the elements of one embodiment of the present system. Cellular wireless network 92 is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules, such as wireless devices 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components of a wireless network 42, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers.<br>
[0050]	In system 92, user manager module 40 can be in communication over a LAN<br>
network 58 with a separate data repository 60 for storing battery performance data 76 gathered from the remote wireless devices 12,14,16,17,18, such as the respective data logs 74. Further, a data management server 62 may be in communication with user manager module 40 to provide post-processing capabilities, data flow control, etc. User manager module 40, data repository 60 and data management server 62 may be present on the cellular network 92 with any other network components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. User manager module 40, and/or data management server 62 communicate with carrier network 64 through a data link 70, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. Carrier network 64 controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a mobile switching center<br><br>
WO 2006/104947			PCT/US2006/010956<br>
("MSC") 68. Further, carrier network 64 communicates with MSC 68 by a network 70, such as the Internet, and/or POTS ("plain old telephone service"). Typically, in network 70, a network or Internet portion transfers data, and the POTS portion transfers voice information. MSC 68 may be connected to multiple base stations ("BTS") 72 by another network 74, such as a data network and/or Internet portion for data transfer and a POTS portion for voice information. BTS 72 ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones 12, by short messaging service ("SMS"), or other over-the-air methods.<br>
[0051]	Referring to Fig. 3, each wireless device, such as cellular telephone 12 in this<br>
case, has computer platform 13 that can transmit data across wireless network 42, and that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from user manager module 40 or another computer device connected to wireless network 42. Computer platform 13 also includes a processing engine 84, which may be an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC"), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. Processing engine 84 or other processor such as ASIC may execute an application programming interface ("API") layer 34 that interfaces with any resident programs, such as battery performance module 20, in a memory 18 of the wireless device. API 34 is a runtime environment executing on the respective wireless device. One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) software developed by Qualcomm, Inc., of San Diego, California. Other runtime environments may be utilized that, for example, operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory 18 may include read-only and/or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. Computer platform 13 also includes storage 80 that can hold the software applications, files, or data not actively used in memory 18, such as the software applications or data downloaded from user manager module 40. Storage 80 typically includes one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. Additionally, storage 80 can ultimately hold a resident copy of battery performance module 20 or agent, as is further described herein.<br>

the device. Alternatively, the battery performance application may be "pushed" by a<br>
user manager module 40 to the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, or "pulled" from a<br>
user manager module 40 by the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, across a wireless<br>
network 42. Alternatively, the battery performance module 20 may be "pulled" or<br>
"pushed" depending on whether or not the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 has the<br>
latest version of the battery performance module 20 for the respective wireless device<br>
12,14,16,17,18. In another alternative, loading of the battery performance module 20<br>
may be configurable in any manner, for example, being initiated by a predetermined<br>
event, such as a substandard talk time. In another alternative, the pushing or pulling of<br>
the battery performance module 20 to the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 may be<br>
configurable in any manner, for example: being initiated by a predetermined event, such<br>
as the age of the battery 16 on the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, or being initiated<br>
by an event such as a technician receiving a report of poor battery 16 performance by<br>
the user of the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, or by the user of the wireless device<br>
12,14,16,17,18.<br>
[0053]	Further, this embodiment of the method includes loading at least a portion of a<br>
configuration 62 for the battery performance module 20 on the computer platform 13 of the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 (Block 122). For example, the configuration 62 may be embodied within the hardware and/or firmware of the wireless device during the manufacture of the device. Alternatively, the configuration 62 may be "pushed" by a user manager module 40 to the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, or "pulled" from a user manager module 40 by the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, across a wireless network 42. In another alternative, loading of the configuration 62 may be initiated in any manner, for example, being initiated by a predetermined event, such as a substandard talk time. In another alternative, the pushing or pulling of the configuration 62 to the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 may be configurable in any manner, for example: being initiated by a predetermined event, such as the age of the battery 16 on the wireless device 12,14,16,17,18, or being initiated by an event such as a technician receiving a report of poor battery 16 performance by the user of the wireless device 12, 14,16,17,18, or by the user of the wireless device 12,14,16,17,18.<br><br>

[0054]	Optionally, this embodiment of the method may include loading test programs<br>
and/or test data onto the respective wireless device (Block 124), and performing tests and/or simulations of predetermined battery performance based on the test programs and/or test data (Block 126). For example, configuration 62 may include selected test programs 90 and/or selected test data 92 that may be executed by processing engine 84 and/or simulator module 22 to generate the collected performance data 76 and associated data 78 as defined by configuration 62.<br>
[0055]	Further, this embodiment of the method includes collecting battery performance<br>
data 76 and associated data 78 from the processing engine 84 of the wireless device 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 in accordance with the configuration 62 (Block 128). For example, battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 retrieved from processing engine 84 of the wireless device during its operation may be stored in data log 74. In one embodiment, the configuration 62 contains test programs 90 for a simulator module 22 to execute, while battery performance data 76 and associated data 78 are retrieved from the processing engine 84. For example, test programs 90 may include such tests as performing a call or transmitting data using HTTP. The simulator module 22 would perform these tests while the battery performance module 20 collected battery performance data 76 and associated data 78.<br>
[0056]	Further, this embodiment of the method includes forwarding the collected<br>
