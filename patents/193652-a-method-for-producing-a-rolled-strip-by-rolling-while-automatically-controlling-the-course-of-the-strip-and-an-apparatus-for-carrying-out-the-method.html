Description<br>
Method of, and equipment for, controlling the course of a rolled strip<br>
The invention relates to a method of, and equipment for, controlling the course of a rolled strip in a roll train having at least one roll stand.<br>
During the rolling of a rolled strip, it is intended that the latter run symmetrically with respect to the centre line of the roll train. If it deviates from this desired intended position, then, for example, problems occur during coiling up. This applies in particular to Steckel rolling mills. Furthermore, there is the risk that the rolled strip will run against lateral stops and be deformed. Furthermore, in the event of a deviation from the desired intended positions, problems during rolling occur in the form that a roll stand will tilt, which leads to profile and flatness problems in the rolled strip.<br>
The centering of the rolled strip by means of 1<br>
lateral guidance, for example, is known as a counter !i<br>
measure. However, this method can only be used when at a h<br>
standstill, since during rolling the strip edges of the i<br>
rolled strip can be impaired.	'"<br>
It is the object of the invention to specify f equipment and a method for controlling the course of a rolled strip, by means of which the abovementioned disadvantages are avoided. Furthermore, it is desirable to raise the quality of the rolled strip by means of such equipment or by means of such a method.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of a method according to Claim 1 and equipment according to Claim 6. In this case, for controlling the course of a rolled strip in a roll train having at least one roll stand, the position of the rolled strip is measured, and the position of the rolled strip is controlled to a desired intended position, using the measured values of the position, by setting the<br><br>

GR 97 P 3061 P <br>
rolling-force distribution in the longitudinal direction of the rolls of the roll stand- In this way, it is possible to make the rolled strip run, in a particularly good approximation, symmetrically with respect to the centre line. In this case, it has surprisingly been shown that the control of the course according to the invention of a rolled strip can control the position of the rolled strip rapidly in such a way that the necessary tolerances for the position of the rolled strip, for example when being threaded into a coil, can be maintained.<br>
In an advantageous refinement of the invention, in the event of a deviation of the position of the rolled strip from the desired intended position, the rolling force on the side of the rolled strip in whose direction the position of the rolled strip deviates from the desired intended position of the rolled strip is increased. In this case, the position of the rolled strip is advantageously measured downstream of the roll stand.<br>
The invention is particularly advantageously applied in the case of roll stands which are directly followed by a coil. This applies in particular in the case of so-called Steckel rolling mills.<br>
The invention has also proven to be particularly advantageous for the rolling of hard metal sheets, such as transformer laminations. Further advantages and inventive details emerge from the following description and exemplary embodiments, with reference to the drawings and in conjunction with the subclaims . FIG 1 shows the deviation of a rolled strip, FIG 2 shows the control according to the invention of<br>
the course of a rolled strip, FIG 3 shows a single-stand roll train having control<br>
according to the invention of the strip course, FIG 4 shows a multi-stand roll train having control<br>
according to the invention of the strip course,<br>
and FIG 5 shows a strip course controller.<br><br>
GR 97 P 3061 P	- 3 -<br>
FIG 1 Shows the deviation c of a rolled strip 1 from the desired position 3 of the rolled strip 1 downstream of a roll stand 2. In this case, reference symbol 13 designates the direction of motion of the rolled strip. According to the invention, the position of the rolled strip 1, in relation to the centre line of the roll train or, respectively, of the relevant roll stand 2 is measured, and the position of the rolled strip 1 is controlled to a desired intended position, using the measured values of the position, by setting the rolling force or the rolling-force distribution of the roll stand 2. In this case, in the event of a deviation c of the position of the rolled strip 1 from the desired intended position 3, the rolling force on the side of the rolled strip 1 in whose direction the position of the rolled strip 1 deviates from the desired intended position 3 of the rolled strip 1 is increased with respect to the other side. In the present exemplary embodiment, a deviation to the right of the position of the rolled strip 1 from the desired position 3 of the rolled strip 1 is detected. In order to control out this deviation, the rolling force in the roll stand 2 is increased on the right-hand side of the rolled strip 1.<br>
FIG 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the control according to the invention of the course of a rolled strip 9. The rolled strip is rolled in a roll stand, indicated in the present case by two working rolls 6 and 7 and two supporting rolls 4 and 5. In this case, the arrow 10 designates the direction of motion of the rolled strip 9. The position of the rolled strip 9 is<br>
measured by a strip measuring device 8, which in the<br>
, . , measured values from the strip measuring device 8 are<br>
processed by a strip course controller 11, which ascertains intended values for a roll-gap setting 12.<br>
FIG 3 shows a Steckel roll train, which has two coils 20, 21 and a roll stand 22. The rolled strip 23 is unwound from one coil 2 0 or 21, rolled in the roll stand 22 and wound up on the other coil 21 or 20. This opera-<br><br>
GR 97 P 3061 P	- 4 -<br>
tion is subsequently reversed. The position of the rolled strip is in this case determined by means of two strip measuring devices 33 and 34 and forwarded via data lines 36 and 38 to an automation device 35. If the rolled strip 23 is being wound on to the coil 20, then the position is determined by means of the strip measuring device 33. By contrast, if the rolled strip 23 is being wound onto the coil 21, then the position of the rolled strip 23 is determined by the means of the strip measuring device 34. The determination of the position of the rolled strip 23 is particularly important for threading into the coils 2 0 and 21. Implemented on the automation device 35 is a strip course controller, which on the basis of the measured values ascertained by the strip measuring devices 33 and 34 ascertains intended values for the rolling force or the rolling-force distribution, which intended values are fed to the roll stand 22 via a data line 37. Instead of the individual data lines 36, 37, 38, a bus system can also be used.<br>
FIG 4 shows a multi-stand roll train having control according to the invention of the strip course. The roll train has roll stands, 24, 25, 26, 27 for rolling a rolled strip 29, which is subsequently wound onto a coil 28. The position of the rolled strip is measured between roll stand 27 and coil 28 using a strip measuring device 30. The roll stands 24, 25, 26, 27 and the strip measuring device 3 0 are connected to an automation device 32 via a data line 31, which in the present case is designed as a bus system. In addition to conventional control tasks for the roll stands 24, 25, 26, 27, a strip course controller is also implemented on the automation device 32, and controls the rolling force in the stand 27 as a function of the measured values ascertained by the strip measuring device 30. In special cases, the rolling force can also be influenced in the roll stands 24, 25 and 26 by the strip course controller.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to place the strip course controller according to the invention in a higher-order or lower-order relationship with a conven-<br><br>
GR 97 P 3061 P	- 5 -<br>
tional rolling-force regulator or controller. In this case, it is advantageous to implement both on the same hardware platform. This also applies to the exemplary embodiments according to FIG 3 and FIG 4.<br>
FIG 5 shows a strip course controller which, in the present exemplary embodiment, forms a pivoting intended value, that is to say a value for the distribution of the rolling force onto the two sides of the roll stand, from the deviation 40 of the position of the rolled strip from the desired position of the rolled strip, the strip width 41 and the rolling force 42. To this end, firstly the deviation 40 of the position of the rolled strip from the desired position of the rolled strip is fed to a characteristic curve 43, the output of which, together with the strip width 41 and the rolling force 42, forms input variables for an adaptor 44 having an optional amplifier. The adaptor 44 ascertains the pivoting intended value 45 from these input variables.<br><br>
