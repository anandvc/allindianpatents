				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NON-AQUEOUS PIGMENT INK<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a non-aqueous pigment ink, and relates<br>
particularly to a non-aqueous pigment ink that is suitable for use in an inkjet recording<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The coloring materials for inks used in inkjet recording systems can be broadly<br>
classified into materials that use pigments and materials that use dyes, and there is a<br>
growing tendency for the use of inks that use pigments as the coloring materials, as such<br>
inks exhibit the excellent levels of light resistance, weather resistance and water resistance<br>
that are required for high image quality printing.<br>
[0003]<br>
In terms of the solvent, inks can be broadly classified into aqueous inks and non-<br>
aqueous inks. Non-aqueous inks that do not use water as the ink solvent, including<br>
solvent-based inks that use a volatile solvent as the main constituent and oil-based inks<br>
that use a non-volatile solvent as the main constituent, exhibit good drying properties to<br>
aqueous inks, and also display excellent printability.<br>
[0004]<br>
In non-aqueous inks, a pigment dispersant that dissolves in the solvent is generally<br>
used, but because this pigment dispersant improves the affinity between the solvent and<br>
the pigment, when the solvent penetrates into the recording paper, the pigment tends to be<br>
also drawn into the interior of the recording paper. As a result, the print density tends to<br>
fall, and show-through becomes more prevalent.<br>
Accordingly, a non-aqueous pigment ink has been proposed that uses as a<br>
dispersant non-aqueous resin dispersion microparticles (NAD = Non Aqua Dispersion)<br>
having a pigment dispersion capability.<br>

Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-197500<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS INVENTION AIMS TO SOLVE<br>
[0006]<br>
By using a pigment dispersant that does not dissolve in the solvent, the above non-<br>
aqueous ink is able to provide improved print density for printed items on plain paper.<br>
However, according to investigations conducted by the inventors of the present invention,<br>
further improvements are still required in terms of the pigment dispersion stability.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has an object of providing a non-aqueous<br>
pigment ink which suppresses show-through and improves the print density in printed<br>
items, and also exhibits excellent storage stability.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0007]<br>
A first aspect of the present invention provides a non-aqueous pigment ink<br>
comprising a pigment, a non-aqueous solvent, and non-aqueous resin dispersion<br>
microparticles having a pigment dispersion capability, wherein<br>
the non-aqueous resin dispersion microparticles are an acrylic polymer comprising<br>
an alkyl (meth)acrylate unit having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a<br>
(meth)acrylate unit having a urethane group,<br>
the acrylic polymer is a copolymer of a monomer mixture comprising an alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate (A) having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a reactive<br>
(meth)acrylate (B) having a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group,<br>
wherein the urethane group is introduced by a reaction between the functional group<br>
capable of reacting with an amino group, an amino alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate<br>
compound, and<br>
the mass ratio within the acrylic polymer between the copolymer portion and the<br>
introduced urethane group portions is within a range from 60:40 to 99:1.<br>
[0008]<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a pigment dispersant for a non-<br>
aqueous pigment ink, wherein<br>
the pigment dispersant is composed of an acrylic polymer comprising an alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate unit having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a<br>
(meth)acrylate unit having a urethane group, and is insoluble in solvents having a 50%<br>
distillation point of 150Â°C or higher,<br>
the acrylic polymer is a copolymer of a monomer mixture comprising an alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate (A) having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a reactive<br>
(meth)acrylate (B) having a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group,<br>
wherein the urethane group is introduced by a reaction between the functional group<br>
capable of reacting with an amino group, an amino alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate<br>
compound, and<br>
the mass ratio within the acrylic polymer between the copolymer portion and the<br>
introduced urethane group portions is within a range from 60:40 to 99:1.<br>
EFFECTS OF INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br>
The non-aqueous ink according to the present invention (hereafter also referred to<br>
as simply "the ink") uses, as a pigment dispersant, non-aqueous resin dispersion<br>
microparticles composed of an acrylic polymer comprising an alkyl (meth)acrylate unit<br>
having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a (meth)acrylate unit having a<br>
urethane group. These non-aqueous resin dispersion microparticles undergo a powerful<br>
interaction (adsorption) with the pigment, and therefore image show-through on the<br>
printed item can be reduced, and the storage stability of the ink can be improved.<br>
Moreover, because even a small amount of the non-aqueous resin dispersion<br>
microparticles is capable of generating a satisfactory pigment dispersion effect, the<br>
viscosity of the ink can be suppressed to a low level, thereby enabling the discharge<br>
stability to be improved when the ink is used as an inkjet ink.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
The ink according to the present invention comprises, as essential components, a<br>
pigment, a non-aqueous solvent (hereafter also referred to as simply "the solvent"), and<br>
non-aqueous resin dispersion microparticles (NAD, hereafter also referred to as "NAD<br>
microparticles") having a pigment dispersion capability as a pigment dispersant.<br>
The NAD microparticles are composed of an acrylic polymer (or more specifically a<br>
urethane-modified acrylic polymer) comprising an alkyl (meth)acrylate unit having an<br>
alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a (meth)acrylate unit having a urethane<br>
group, and this polymer does not dissolve in the non-aqueous solvent used in the ink, but<br>
rather forms microparticles within the ink. Here, the term "(meth)acrylate" includes both<br>
acrylate and methacrylate.<br>
[0011]<br>
The NAD microparticles form a core/shell structure composed of a core portion (a<br>
polar portion) that does not dissolve in the non-aqueous solvent of the ink, and a shell<br>
portion (a low-polarity portion) that is positioned at the solvent side of each microparticle<br>
and is solvated. It is thought that the core portion that is insoluble in the solvent has a role<br>
of improving the separation of the solvent and the pigment following printing, thereby<br>
preventing the pigment from penetrating into the interior of the paper together with the<br>
solvent, which enables the pigment to be retained at the paper surface, thus improving the<br>
print density. In contrast, it is thought that the shell portion (steric repulsion layer) has a<br>
role of enhancing the dispersion stability within the solvent, enabling the formation of the<br>
particle dispersion system.<br>
[0012]<br>
Due to the inclusion of a long-chain alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms, the<br>
aforementioned alkyl (meth)acrylate unit exhibits excellent affinity with the non-aqueous<br>
solvent, thereby enhancing the dispersion stability within the non-aqueous solvent and<br>
performing the role of the shell portion. The alkyl chain of the ester portion may be either<br>
a linear or branched chain. Although there are no particular restrictions on the upper limit<br>
for the number of carbon atoms within this alkyl group, for reasons including availability<br>
of the raw material, the number of carbon atoms is preferably not more than 25.<br>
Examples of the alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms include a dodecyl group,<br>
tridecyl group, tetradecyl group, pentadecyl group, hexadecyl group, heptadecyl group,<br>
octadecyl group, nonadecyl group, eicosanyl group, heneicosanyl group, docosanyl group,<br>
isododecyl group or isooctadecyl group. A plurality of these groups may also be included.<br>
[0013]<br>
As a result of containing a urethane group (urethane bond) that has a high polarity<br>
and adsorbs the pigment, namely a carbamate ester portion (H2NCOOR or RNHCOOR),<br>
the aforementioned (meth)acrylate unit having a urethane group encapsulates the pigment<br>
to form the core portion (the solvent-insoluble portion) of the NAD microparticles.<br>
The urethane groups form side chains (branches) off the main chain (backbone) of<br>
the acrylic polymer together with the above long-chain alkyl groups. These urethane<br>
group-containing branches may be polyurethanes formed from repeating urethane bonds,<br>
thereby forming branch polymers.<br>
[0014]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the molecular weight (mass average<br>
molecular weight) of the acrylic polymer, although if the ink is to be used as an inkjet ink,<br>
then from the viewpoint of achieving favorable ink dischargeability, the molecular weight<br>
is preferably within a range from approximately 10,000 to 100,000, and is more preferably<br>
from approximately 20,000 to 80,000.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the acrylic polymer is preferably not<br>
higher than room temperature, and is more preferably 0Â°C or lower. This ensures that<br>
when the ink is fixed on the recording medium, film formation can be promoted at room<br>
temperature.<br>
There are also no particular restrictions on the particle size of the NAD<br>
microparticles, but when used within an inkjet ink, the particle size of the NAD<br>
microparticles must be sufficiently small compared with the nozzle diameter, and is<br>
typically not more than 0.3 urn, and preferably not more than 0.1 urn.<br>
[0015]<br>
The acrylic polymer is preferably produced from a copolymer (hereafter, this<br>
copolymer is also referred to as "the backbone polymer") of a monomer mixture<br>
comprising an alkyl (meth)acrylate (A) having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms<br>
(hereafter also referred to as "the monomer (A)"), and a reactive (meth)acrylate (B)<br>
having a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group (hereafter also referred<br>
to as "the monomer (B)"), by introducing urethane groups into the copolymer via a<br>
reaction between the functional group capable of reacting with an amino group, an amino<br>
alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate compound.<br>
[0016]<br>
Specific examples of the alkyl (meth)acrylate (A) having a long-chain alkyl group<br>
of 12 or more carbon atoms, and preferably 12 to 25 carbon atoms, include lauryl<br>
(meth)acrylate, cetyl (meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, behenyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
isolauryl (meth)acrylate and isostearyl (meth)acrylate. A plurality of these<br>
(meth)acrylates may also be included.<br>
[0017]<br>
Preferred examples of the functional group capable of reacting with an amino<br>
group within the reactive (meth)acrylate (B) include a glycidyl group, vinyl group and<br>
(meth)acryloyl group.<br>
A preferable example of the monomer (B) having a glycidyl group is glycidyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, whereas preferable examples of the monomer (B) having a vinyl group<br>
include vinyl (meth)acrylate and 2-(2-vinyloxyethoxy)ethyl (meth)acrylate. Examples of<br>
the monomer (B) having a (meth)acryloyl group include dipropylene glycol<br>
di(meth)acrylate and 1,6-hexanediol di(meth)acrylate. A plurality of these reactive<br>
(meth)acrylates (B) may also be included.<br>
[0018]<br>
Besides the aforementioned monomers (A) and (B), the monomer mixture may<br>
also include another monomer (C) capable of undergoing copolymerization with the<br>
monomers (A) and (B), provided inclusion of the monomer (C) does not impair the effects<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Examples of this monomer (C) include styrene-based monomers such as styrene<br>
and a-methylstyrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl ether-based monomers such as<br>
butyl vinyl ether, maleate esters, fumarate esters, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and a-<br>
olefins. Further, alkyl (meth)acrylates in which the alkyl chain length is less than 12<br>
carbon atoms may also be used, including 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, isooctyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and tert-octyl (meth)acrylate. These monomers may be used individually,<br>
or in combinations of two or more compounds.<br>
[0019]<br>
The amount of the alkyl (meth)acrylate (A) in the above monomer mixture is<br>
preferably not less than 30% by mass, more preferably within a range from 40 to 95% by<br>
mass, and most preferably from 50 to 90% by mass.<br>
The amount of the reactive (meth)acrylate (B) is preferably within a range from 1<br>
to 30% by mass, and more preferably from 3 to 25% by mass.<br>
The amount of the monomer (C) other than the monomers (A) and (B) is<br>
preferably not more than 60% by mass, and more preferably within a range from 10 to<br>
40% by mass.<br>
[0020]<br>
For the monomer (C), the use of a monomer (C1) having a p-diketone group or Ã-<br>
keto ester group is preferred. Including such a monomer (C1) enables the viscosity of the<br>
ink to be reduced. This means that when selecting a solvent for the ink, there are fewer<br>
restrictions on the viscosity of the solvent itself, thereby expanding the range of non-<br>
aqueous solvents that may be selected. Further, in those cases where fixing resins or<br>
additives are added to the ink according to need, the permissible increase in the ink<br>
viscosity caused by adding such components is expanded, resulting in a greater degree of<br>
freedom when determining the ink formulation.<br>
Moreover, including the monomer (C1) enables functional groups having an ionic<br>
group to be introduced into the backbone polymer. Generally, introducing ionic groups<br>
into a low-polarity non-aqueous solvent causes an increase in the ink viscosity, but the<br>
existence of the monomer (C1) is able to suppress this viscosity increase. The inclusion of<br>
the monomer (C1) also contributes to electrostatic aggregation and fixation of the ink<br>
upon contact with the recording medium, resulting in improved print density and<br>
suppression of show-through.<br>
[0021]<br>
Moreover, by overprinting a black ink containing the monomer (C1) on top of a<br>
cyan ink, a printed item with a higher print density can be obtained with good suppression<br>
of image show-through. The inventors of the present invention found that this effect was<br>
more marked when the backbone polymer included the monomer (C1) than when the<br>
backbone polymer did not include the monomer (C1).<br>
[0022]<br>
In the monomer (C1), preferred examples of the P-diketone group include an<br>
acetoacetyl group and a propionylacetyl group, whereas preferred examples of the P-keto<br>
ester group include an acetoacetoxy group and a propionylacetoxy group, although these<br>
are not exhaustive lists.<br>
Preferred examples of the monomer (C1) include (meth)acrylates and<br>
(meth)acrylamides comprising a p-diketone group or P-keto ester group in the ester chain.<br>
Specific examples include acetoacetoxyalkyl (meth)acrylates such as acetoacetoxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, hexadione (meth)acrylate, and acetoacetoxyalkyl (meth)acrylamides such<br>
as acetoacetoxyethyl (meth)acrylamide. These monomers may be used individually, or in<br>
combinations of two or more compounds.<br>
[0023]<br>
When included, the amount of the monomer (C1) within the monomer mixture is<br>
preferably within a range from 3 to 30% by mass, and more preferably from 5 to 20% by<br>
mass in view of the effects obtained by adding the monomer (C1) and the storage stability<br>
of the resulting ink.<br>
[0024]<br>
The monomers described above can be polymerized easily by conventional radical<br>
copolymerization. The reaction is preferably conducted as either a solution<br>
polymerization or a dispersion polymerization.<br>
In such cases, in order to ensure that the molecular weight of the acrylic polymer<br>
following polymerization satisfies the preferred range mentioned above, the use of a chain<br>
transfer agent during polymerization is effective. Examples of compounds that can be<br>
used as this chain transfer agent include thiols such as n-butyl mercaptan, lauryl<br>
mercaptan, stearyl mercaptan and cyclohexyl mercaptan.<br>
[0025]<br>
Examples of polymerization initiators that may be used include conventional<br>
thermal polymerization initiators, including azo compounds such as AIBN<br>
(azobisisobutyronitrile) and peroxides such as t-butyl peroxybenzoate and t-butylperoxy-<br>
2-ethylhexanoate (Perbutyl O, manufactured by NOF Corporation). Alternatively, a<br>
photopolymerization initiator may be used in which irradiation with an active energy<br>
beam is used to generate radicals.<br>
Petroleum-based solvents (such as aroma-free (AF) solvents) and the like can be<br>
used as the polymerization solvent used in a solution polymerization. This polymerization<br>
solvent is preferably one or more solvents selected from among those solvents (listed<br>
below) that can be used, as is, for the non-aqueous solvent within the ink.<br>
During the polymerization reaction, other typically employed polymerization<br>
inhibitors, polymerization accelerators and dispersants and the like may also be added to<br>
the reaction system.<br>
[0026]<br>
Subsequently, urethane groups are introduced into the obtained copolymer (the<br>
backbone polymer) by reacting the functional group capable of reacting with an amino<br>
group with an amino alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate compound. The amino group of<br>
the amino alcohol reacts with, and bonds to, the functional group capable of reacting with<br>
an amino group within the monomer (B). The isocyanate ester group (R1N=C=O) of the<br>
polyvalent isocyanate compound then undergoes an addition reaction with the hydroxyl<br>
group of the amino alcohol in the manner illustrated below, thus yielding a urethane group<br>
(urethane bond) (a carbamate ester: R1NHCOOR):<br>
R1N=C=O + R-OH ? ROCONHR1<br>
wherein R- represents the amino alcohol portion bonded to the functional group of the<br>
backbone polymer.<br>
In this manner, urethane groups that function as pigment adsorption groups are<br>
introduced into the backbone polymer, which has no pigment adsorption capability.<br>
[0027]<br>
Examples of the amino alcohol include monomethylethanolamine, diethanolamine<br>
and diisopropanolamine. Of these, dialkanolamines (secondary alkanolamines)<br>
represented by a general formula (HOR)2NH (wherein R is a divalent hydrocarbon group)<br>
are preferred, as they provide two hydroxyl groups, enabling the number of urethane<br>
groups formed to be increased. A combination of a plurality of these amino alcohols may<br>
also be used.<br>
[0028]<br>
From the viewpoint of introducing an appropriate amount of urethane groups, this<br>
amino alcohol is preferably reacted in an amount within a range from 0.05 to 1 molar<br>
equivalents, and more preferably 0.1 to 1 molar equivalents, relative to the amount of the<br>
functional group capable of reacting with an amino group within the monomer (B). When<br>
the amount of the amino alcohol is less than 1 molar equivalent, unreacted functional<br>
groups will remain in some of the monomer (B) units, but it is thought that these residual<br>
functional groups act as pigment adsorption groups.<br>
[0029]<br>
Examples of the polyvalent isocyanate compound include aliphatic, alicyclic and<br>
aromatic compounds, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, l,3-bis(isocyanatomethyl)benzene,<br>
l,3-bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane, and 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate. A plurality of<br>
these compounds may also be used in combination.<br>
In order to ensure that no unreacted raw materials or the like remain following<br>
introduction of the urethane groups via reaction of the polyvalent isocyanate compound<br>
with the hydroxyl groups, the polyvalent isocyanate compound is preferably reacted in an<br>
amount that is substantially equimolar (0.98 to 1.02 molar equivalents) with the amount of<br>
hydroxyl groups contained with the supplied raw material.<br>
[0030]<br>
In this manner, urethane side chains (grafts) that are insoluble in the solvent are<br>
formed at the amino alcohol sites bonded to the monomer (B) units within the copolymer<br>
portion (backbone polymer) that is soluble in the solvent, and these urethane side chains<br>
form dispersion particle nuclei. The final result of this process is the formation of<br>
polymer particles (NAD microparticles) enveloped within a shell structure (the backbone<br>
polymer) that can undergo solvation within the solvent.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the above reaction, a polyhydric alcohol is preferably also added, so that the<br>
polyhydric alcohol and the polyvalent isocyanate compound are reacted. By adding a<br>
polyhydric alcohol, the urethane group formation can be repeated, enabling polyurethane<br>
side chains (namely, branch polymers) that function as higher polarity side chains to be<br>
obtained.<br>
Examples of the polyhydric alcohol include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. A<br>
plurality of these polyhydric alcohols may also be used.<br>
The polyhydric alcohol is important for controlling the size of the NAD particles,<br>
and as the amount of the polyhydric alcohol is increased, the NAD particles increase in<br>
size. However, if the particle size increases excessively, then the discharge stability and<br>
pigment dispersibility of the ink tend to deteriorate, and therefore the amount of the<br>
polyhydric alcohol relative to the amino alcohol is preferably within a range from 0 to 20<br>
molar equivalents, and more preferably from 1 to 10 molar equivalents.<br>
[0032]<br>
The mass ratio between the copolymer portion (backbone polymer) and the<br>
introduced urethane group portions (branches or branch polymers) within the acrylic<br>
polymer is preferably within a range from 60:40 to 99:1, and is more preferably from<br>
70:30 to 99:1. The mass of the copolymer portion within the acrylic polymer represents<br>
the combined mass of the monomers used in the copolymerization, whereas the mass of<br>
the introduced urethane group portions represents the combined mass of the amino alcohol<br>
and the polyvalent isocyanate compound used in the grafting reaction, or in those cases<br>
where a polyhydric alcohol is also used, represents the combined mass of the amino<br>
alcohol, the polyvalent isocyanate compound and the polyhydric alcohol.<br>
[0033]<br>
The obtained NAD microparticles themselves exhibit an excellent pigment<br>
dispersion capability, and therefore the amount of the NAD microparticles may be less<br>
than that of conventional pigment dispersants, and no other separate pigment dispersant<br>
needs to be added. As a result, the types of problems typically associated with the<br>
addition of a polymer-based pigment dispersant, namely an increase in the viscosity of the<br>
ink and a deterioration in the storage stability, can be suppressed, and the discharge<br>
stability within an inkjet recording system can be improved. Moreover, favorable storage<br>
stability can be achieved not only under normal operating conditions, but also under high-<br>
temperature conditions.<br>

[0040]<br>
The ink may also include other arbitrary components in amounts that do not impair<br>
the effects of the present invention.<br>
For example, resins that may be added besides the above NAD microparticles<br>
include acrylic resins, styrene-acrylic resins, styrene-maleic acid resins, rosin-based<br>
resins, rosin ester-based resins, ethylene-vinyl acetate resins, petroleum resins,<br>

[0041]<br>
Appropriate amounts of nozzle blockage prevention agents, antioxidants,<br>
conductivity modifiers, viscosity modifiers, surface tension modifiers and oxygen<br>
absorbers and the like may also be added. There are no particular restrictions on the<br>
specific variety of these additives, and the types of materials typically used within this<br>
technical field may be used.<br>
[0042]<br>
The amount of the pigment within the ink is typically within a range from 0.01 to<br>
20% by mass, and from the viewpoints of print density and ink viscosity, is preferably<br>
within a range from 1 to 15% by mass, and more preferably from 5 to 10% by mass.<br>
In terms of ensuring favorable pigment dispersibility, the amount of the NAD<br>
microparticles within the ink is preferably not less than 0.1% by mass, and is more<br>
preferably 2% by mass or greater. However, if the amount of the NAD microparticles is<br>
too high, then not only does the ink viscosity become overly high, but the storage stability<br>
under high-temperature conditions also tends to worsen, and therefore the amount of the<br>
NAD microparticles is preferably not more than 20% by mass, and is more preferably<br>
10% by mass or less. The amount of the NAD microparticles within the ink is most<br>
preferably within a range from 3 to 8% by mass.<br>
[0043]<br>
The mass of the NAD microparticles (or the total mass of resin in those cases<br>
where the ink includes other resins besides the NAD microparticles) relative to a value of<br>
1 for the mass of the pigment is preferably at least 0.5 from the viewpoint of ensuring a<br>
favorable pigment dispersibility effect, and is preferably not more than 1 from the<br>
viewpoints of improving the ink viscosity and avoiding discharge faults caused by<br>
changes in the ink over time.<br>
[0044]<br>
When used within an inkjet recording system, the ideal range for the viscosity of<br>
the ink varies depending on factors such as the diameter of the discharge head nozzles and<br>
the discharge environment, but at 23Â°C, is preferably within a range from 5 to 30 mPa-s,<br>
and more preferably from 5 to 15 mPa-s. An ink viscosity of approximately 10 mPa-s is<br>
the most desirable for use within an inkjet recording apparatus. Here, the viscosity is<br>
measured at 23Â°C by raising the shear stress from 0 Pa at a rate of 0.1 Pa/s, and refers to<br>
the measured value at 10 Pa.<br>
[0045]<br>
A pigment dispersant for a non-aqueous pigment ink according to the present<br>
invention is composed of an acrylic polymer comprising an alkyl (meth)acrylate unit<br>
having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a (meth)acrylate unit having a<br>
urethane group, and is insoluble in solvents having a 50% distillation point of 150Â°C or<br>
higher.<br>
The acrylic polymer is preferably a copolymer of a monomer mixture comprising an<br>
alkyl (meth)acrylate (A) having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a reactive<br>
(meth)acrylate (B) having a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group,<br>
wherein urethane groups have been introduced therein by a reaction between the<br>
functional group capable of reacting with an amino group, an amino alcohol and a<br>
polyvalent isocyanate compound, and the mass ratio between the copolymer portion and<br>
the introduced urethane group portions is preferably within a range from 60:40 to 99:1.<br>
When added to a non-aqueous pigment ink, this pigment dispersant forms NAD<br>
microparticles that exhibit the type of pigment dispersion effect described above. As a<br>
result, a non-aqueous pigment ink can be provided which yields increased print density for<br>
printed items, and also offers excellent storage stability.<br>
[0046]<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the printing method used with the<br>
ink according to the present invention, printing is preferably conducted using an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus. The inkjet printer may employ any of various printing systems,<br>
including a piezo system, electrostatic system or thermal system. In those cases where an<br>
inkjet recording apparatus is used, the ink according to the present invention is discharged<br>
from the inkjet head based on a digital signal, and the discharged ink droplets are adhered<br>
to a recording medium.<br>
The ink according to the present invention can be used favorably even under low-<br>
temperature conditions, and exhibits excellent discharge stability when used within an<br>
inkjet recording system.<br>
In the obtained printed item, the pigment within the ink is inhibited from<br>
penetrating into the interior of the printing paper, and is rather retained at the surface of<br>
the paper, resulting in a high print density.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0047]<br>
A more detailed description of the present invention is provided below based on a<br>
series of examples, although the present invention is in no way limited by these examples.<br>
In the following description, the units "% by mass" are abbreviated as simply "%".<br><example><br>
(1) Synthesis of copolymers (backbone polymers a to f)<br>
A 300 ml four-neck flask was charged with 75 g of AF-4 (a naphthene-based<br>
solvent, manufactured by Nippon Oil Corporation), and the temperature was raised to<br>
110Â°C under a stream of nitrogen gas and with constant stirring. Subsequently, with the<br>
temperature held at 110Â°C, a mixture containing 16.7 g of AF-4 and 2 g of Perbutyl 0 (t-<br>
butylperoxy-2-ethylhexanoate, manufactured by NOF Corporation) was added dropwise<br>
to a monomer mixture with the composition shown in Table 1 over a period of 3 hours.<br>
Subsequently, with the temperature maintained at 110Â°C, additional 0.2 g samples of<br>
Perbutyl O were added after stirring for an additional one hour and two hours respectively.<br>
The reaction mixture was aged for a further one hour at 110Â°C, and was then diluted with<br>
10.6 g of AF-4, yielding a colorless and transparent solution of a backbone polymer a to f<br>
with a non-volatile fraction of 50%.<br>
The mass average molecular weight (determined by a GPC method and referenced<br>
against polystyrene standards) of each of the obtained backbone polymers was within a<br>
range from 20,000 to 23,000.<br>

[0050]<br>
(2) Production of non-aqueous dispersions containing NAD microparticles<br>
A 500 mL four-neck flask was charged with 81 g of isooctyl palmitate (TOP,<br>
manufactured by Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd.), 200 g of the solution of the backbone<br>
polymer a obtained in (1) above (solid fraction within AF-4 solvent: 50%), 4.0 g of<br>
propylene glycol and 2.8 g of diethanolamine, and the temperature was raised to 110Â°C<br>
under a stream of nitrogen gas and with constant stirring. The temperature was held at<br>
110Â°C for one hour to enable the reaction between the glycidyl groups of the backbone<br>
polymer a and the diethanolamine to proceed to completion. Subsequently, 0.2 g of<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate was added, and a mixture containing 10.2 g of Takenate 600 (1,3-<br>
bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane, manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.) and 91.8 g<br>
of IOP was then added dropwise to the flask over a period of one hour. Following<br>
completion of the dropwise addition, the temperature was raised to 120Â°C, the reaction<br>
was allowed to proceed for 6 hours, and the reaction mixture was then cooled, yielding a<br>
non-aqueous dispersion Dl having a solid fraction (NAD microparticles) of 30%.<br>
Using the same method, non-aqueous dispersions D2 to D9 were produced with<br>
the formulations shown in Table 2. The amounts listed for the backbone polymers in<br>
Table 2 represent solid fraction amounts.<br>
The mass average molecular weight (determined by a GPC method and referenced<br>
against polystyrene standards) for each of the obtained acrylic polymers (including the<br>
branch polymers) was within a range from 22,000 to 26,000.<br>
[0052]<br>
In a separate preparation, an acrylic-modified polymer (NAD microparticles) in<br>
which the branch polymers were also acrylic polymers was synthesized in the manner<br>
described below for the purpose of comparison.<br>
A 500 mL four-neck flask was charged with 100 g of IOP and 200 g of the<br>
solution of the backbone polymer a obtained in (1) above (solid fraction within AF-4<br>
solvent: 50%), and the temperature was raised to 110Â°C under a stream of nitrogen gas<br>
and with constant stirring. Subsequently, with the temperature held at 110Â°C, a mixture<br>
containing 7.6 g of acrylic acid, 5.0 g of methyl methacrylate, 5.0 g of butyl acrylate and<br>
0.5 g of Perbutyl O (t-butylperoxy-2-ethylhexanoate, manufactured by NOF Corporation)<br>
was added dropwise to the flask over a period of 15 minutes. Following completion of the<br>
dropwise addition, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 hours with the temperature<br>
held at 110Â°C. The reaction mixture was then cooled and diluted with 74.4 g of IOP,<br>
yielding a non-aqueous dispersion D10 having a solid fraction of 30%.<br>
[0053]<br>
The solid fraction and solvent composition for each of the non-aqueous dispersions<br>
D1 to D10 were as follows.<br>
[0054]<br>
(3) Preparation of inks<br><example><br>
12.5 g of the prepared dispersion Dl, 5.0 g of a pigment (carbon black MAI 1,<br>
manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.), 7.9 g of AF-4 and 7.9 g of IOP were mixed,<br>
zirconia beads (diameter: 0.5 mm) were added, and the mixture was dispersed for 120<br>
minutes using a rocking mill (manufactured by Seiwa Technical Lab Co., Ltd.).<br>
Following dispersion, the zirconia beads were removed, the dispersion was filtered<br>
sequentially through 3.0 Âµm and 0.8 urn membrane filters to remove any contaminants<br>
and coarse particles, and the mixture was diluted with 8.4 g of AF-4 and 8.4 g of IOP, thus<br>
completing preparation of an ink (pigment content: 10%) in which the pigment was<br>
dispersed by the NAD microparticles.<br>
[0055]<br><examples to comparative examples><br>
Using the blend amounts shown in Table 3, inks of each of the examples and<br>
comparative examples were prepared in the same manner as example 1.<br>
In comparative examples 2 and 3, a solution of the backbone polymer a (solid<br>
fraction: 50%) and Solsperse 28000 (manufactured by The Lubrizol Corporation, solid<br>
fraction: 100%) respectively were used instead of the non-aqueous dispersion.<br>
[0057]<br>
All of the prepared inks exhibited viscosity and pigment particle size properties<br>
that were within the respective ideal ranges for use as inkjet inks. The ink particle size<br>
was measured using a dynamic light-scattering particle size distribution measurement<br>
apparatus LB-500 manufactured by Horiba, Ltd. The viscosity of the ink represents the<br>
viscosity at 10 Pa when the shear stress was raised from 0 Pa at a rate of 0.1 Pa/s at a<br>
temperature of 23Â°C, and was measured using a controlled stress rheometer RS75<br>
manufactured by Haake GmbH (cone angle: 1Â°, diameter: 60 mm).<br>
[0058]<br><ink storage stability><br>
Each of the inks was placed inside a sealed container and left to stand for 4 weeks<br>
at 70Â°C, and following this standing period, the changes in the ink viscosity and particle<br>
size were measured, and the measurement results were evaluated in the manner described<br>
below.<br>
Viscosity/particle size change:<br>
[(Viscosity/particle size after 4 weeks x 100) / (Initial viscosity/particle size)] -100 (%)<br>
Inks for which the changes in the viscosity and the particle size were both less than<br>
5% were evaluated as A, inks for which at least one of the changes in the viscosity and the<br>
particle size was at least 5% but less than 10% were evaluated as B, and inks for which at<br>
least one of the changes in the viscosity and the particle size was 10% or greater were<br>
evaluated as C.<br>
[0059]<br>
Each of the prepared inks was loaded into a printer HC5500 (manufactured by<br>
Riso Kagaku Corporation), and the print density and discharge stability were evaluated by<br>
performing printing onto plain paper (Riso lightweight paper, manufactured by Riso<br>
Kagaku Corporation). The HC5500 is a system that uses a 300 dpi line-type inkjet head<br>
(in which the nozzles are aligned with an approximately 85 Âµm spacing therebetween),<br>
wherein the paper is transported in a sub-scanning direction perpendicular to the main<br>
scanning direction (the direction along which the nozzles are aligned) while printing is<br>
conducted.<br>
[0060]<br><ink discharge stability><br>
100 copies of a solid image with dimensions of 51 mm (600 nozzle widths) in the<br>
main scanning direction x 260 mm in the sub-scanning direction were printed in a<br>
continuous manner. Unprinted portions caused by ink discharge faults were observed as<br>
white bands within the image. The discharge stability was evaluated against the criteria<br>
shown below, by counting the number of these white bands that occurred across the 100<br>
printed items (equivalent to a total of 60,000 nozzles).<br>
No discharge faults: A, less than 5 white bands: B, 5 or more white bands: C<br>
[0061]<br><printed item density><br>
The OD values for the printed surface and the rear surface of a solid image<br>
obtained in the same manner as that described above were measured using an optical<br>
densitometer (RD920, manufactured by Macbeth Corporation), and the image densities<br>
were then evaluated against the criteria below. A high surface OD value indicates high<br>
image density, and a low rear surface OD value indicates minimal show-through, both of<br>
which are desirable.<br>
Print density (surface OD)<br>
A: 1.10 or greater, B: 1.05 to 1.09, C: 1.04 or less<br>
Print density (rear surface OD)<br>
A: 0.25 or less, B: 0.26 to 0.30, C: 0.31 or greater<br>
[0062]<br>
Next, the print density obtained when the ink was overprinted on top of a cyan ink<br>
was evaluated in the manner described below.<br>
Using the same printer and plain paper as those described above, a cyan ink (HC<br>
ink S-4367 Cyan <c>, manufactured by Riso Kagaku Corporation) was first used to print<br>
a solid image, and a black ink from one of the examples or comparative examples was<br>
then used to print a solid image on top of the cyan image. The OD values for the printed<br>
surface and the rear surface of thus obtained carbon ink composite image (C composite<br>
image) were measured in the same manner as described above, and were evaluated against<br>
the criteria below.<br>
Print density (surface OD)<br>
A: 1.22 or greater, B: 1.15 to 1.21, C: 1.08 to 1.14, D: 1.07 or less<br>
Print density (rear surface OD)<br>
A: 0.30 or less, B: 0.31 to 0.34, C: 0.35 to 0.39, D: 0.40 or greater<br>
The results of all the above evaluations are shown in Table 3.<br>
[0063]<br>
Even without the addition of a separate pigment dispersant, each of the inks of the<br>
examples exhibited excellent storage stability under high-temperature conditions, and<br>
yielded printed items of increased density while mamtaining favorable discharge stability.<br>
In contrast, in comparative example 1, the chain length of the side-chain alkyl<br>
groups of the backbone polymer was comparatively short, containing only 8 carbon atoms,<br>
and therefore the dispersion stability within the solvent was poor, and the discharge<br>
stability and storage stability deteriorated.<br>
In comparative example 2, dispersion was performed using a resin in which no<br>
branch polymers (urethane groups) were bonded to the backbone polymer, but the<br>
pigment dispersibility was poor, the discharge stability and storage stability were inferior,<br>
and an increase in the density of the printed items was unobtainable.<br>
Comparative example 3 represents a conventional pigment ink using a<br>
commercially available pigment dispersant, and in this case, although favorable storage<br>
stability was obtained, the pigment tended to penetrate into the paper together with the<br>
solvent and the pigment dispersant, meaning an increase in the density of the printed items<br>
was unobtainable.<br>
Comparative example 4 represents an example using NAD microparticles having<br>
acrylic side chains (branches), but the type of superior performance observed in the<br>
examples for the NAD microparticles having urethane side chains was unobtainable.<br>
[0064]<br>
In example 8, which used NAD microparticles of a polymer in which the backbone<br>
polymer also included the monomer (C1), an additional reduction in the ink viscosity was<br>
achieved, and the print density of the obtained carbon composite image was particularly<br>
superior.<br>

distillation point of 150Â°C or higher,<br>
the acrylic polymer is a copolymer of a monomer mixture comprising an alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate (A) having an alkyl group of 12 or more carbon atoms and a reactive<br>
(meth)acrylate (B) having a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group,<br>
wherein the urethane group is introduced by a reaction between the functional group<br>
capable of reacting with an amino group, an amino alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate<br>
compound, and<br>
a mass ratio within the acrylic polymer between the copolymer portion and the<br>
introduced urethane group portions is within a range from 60:40 to 99:1.<br><br>
Disclosed is a non-aqueous pigment ink comprising a pigment, a non-aqueous solvent, and a non-aqueous resin<br>
dispersion microparticle capable of dispersing the pigment. The non-aqueous resin dispersion microparticle is an acrylic polymer<br>
having an alkyl (meth)acrylate unit having an alkyl group carruing 12 or more carbon atoms and a (meth)acrylate unit having a<br>
urethane group. The acrylic polymer is a copolymer of a monomer mixture containing an alkyl (meth)acrylate (A) having a alkyl<br>
group carrying 12 or more carbon atoms and a reactive (meth)acrylate (B) having a functional group capable of reacting with an<br>
amino group, wherein the urethane group is introduced therein through the reaction among the functional group capable of reacting<br>
with an amino group, an amino alcohol and a polyvalent isocyanate compound. In the acrylic polymer, the ratio of the copolymer<br>
moiety to the introduced urethane group moiety is 60:40 to 99:1 by mass.</c></printed></ink></ink></examples></example></example></td>
