				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to anthelmintic compositions. The anthelmintic is chosen from the class<br>
of macrocyclic lactones including but not limited to the avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin,<br>
abamectin, milbemycin and moxidectin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
This class of anthelmintics are difficult to formulate. For example, the commercially available<br>
injectable antiparasitic agent based on an aqueous co-solvent formulation containing<br>
ivermectin, water and an organic co-solvent, has been shown to result in some precipitation of<br>
the ivermectin at the injection site, with the possibility of irritation to the animal, and possible<br>
loss of effectiveness as an anthelmintic. In pour-on formulations, water miscible formulations<br>
are diluted if there is rain after treatment.<br>
OBJECT<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
These and other aspects of this invention, which should be considered and always novel<br>
aspects, will be apparent from the following examples.<br>
We have found that the particular formulations of the chosen anthelmintic, as set out in the<br>
following examples, can increase the length of activity of the anthelmintic on external and<br>
internal parasites.<br>
Avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin and moxidectin oxidise and<br>
break down in water. Previous formulations of avermectin and ivermectin have been based on<br>
glycol solvents, glycerol formal, surfactants and/or water. These have had the disadvantage<br>
that the abamectin or ivermectin was rapidly released in the animal, giving a shorter activity<br>
which was also sometimes toxic. This resulted from the rapid absorption into the blood stream<br>
of the abamectin or ivermectin and excretion of the drug. It is particularly noted in the case of<br>
young animals, who have a low tolerance to these high levels of abamectin or ivermectin in the<br>
blood stream. Indeed, calves under ten weeks old cannot be treated with an injectable<br>
composition containing abamectin and a co-solvent as this may be toxic.<br>
Avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin and moxidectin are sparingly<br>
soluble in oils such as sesame oil, soya bean oil and corn oil. Pure sesame oil has a relatively<br>
high viscosity, which makes it unsuitable for use as a solvent for injection using typical<br>
veterinary syringes. We have found that by using sesame oil, soya bean oil or corn oil together<br>
with a co-solvent chosen from the class of alcohols having four or more carbon atoms, and<br>
more preferably benzyl alcohol it is possible to make a stable solution containing avermectins,<br>
ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin or moxidectin which allows the avermectins,<br>
ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin or moxidectin to remain in solution even when<br>
stored in cold conditions, whilst at the same time allowing the controlled release of the drug<br>
into the animal's body, for use against both internal and external parasites. Solutions can be<br>
prepared which are suitable for injection, pour-on application and/or oral administration.<br>

Trial 3<br>
A trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy of Trial Solution 1 injection and Stand-by pour-on<br>
formulations against natural infections of gastro-intestinal nematode parasites of cattle.<br>
Twenty-four clinically healthy Friesian and Friesian cross male calves, 6-7 months of age, and<br>
of similar body condition, harbouring natural infections were restrictively randomised into 4<br>
groups. Group 1 remain as the untreated control, Group 2 was injected subcutaneously in the<br>
left side of the neck with Abamectin L A (200µg/kg), Group 3 was treated with the Stand-by<br>
pour-on formulation along the mid line of the back and Group 4 was treated with Ivomec*<br>
Pour-on formulation (500µg/kg) in accordance with the manufacturers recommendation (MSD<br>
AgVet). On days 7 and 8 post treatment the calves were necropsied for worm counts. At<br>
necropsy all the treated groups harboured significantly fewer adult, late 4th and early 4th stage<br>
worms of the main cattle parasites viz. Ostertagia spp. and Cooperia spp. as well as<br>

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES<br>
Animals: Twenty four clinically healthy Friesian and Friesian cross male calves, 6-7 months of<br>
age, and of similar body condition, harbouring natural infections of gastro-intestinal nematodes<br>
were obtained from commercial properties and held on pasture for 7 days prior to the<br>
commencement of the trial. The calves were individually identified by ear tags on arrival at<br>
Wallaceville Animal Research Centre, weighed and sampled for faecal egg counts to ensure<br>
they were carrying adequate worm burdens.<br>
Animal Welfare: Animals handling procedures were in compliance with local regulations and<br>
conducted with the approval of the Wallaceville Animal Ethics Committee - AEC No. 440.<br>
Parasite burdens: On arrival on day -7 the animals were weighed and faecal sampled and a<br>
bulk faecal culture was undertaken to identify the composition of the calves worm burdens.<br>
Treatments: On Day 0 the calves were re-weighed and randomly allocated to four treatment<br>
groups on the basis of faecal egg count, live weight and overall body condition (see Table 1).<br>
Treatments were administered according to individual live weights using disposable 5.0, 10.0<br>
or 20.0 ml graduated plastic syringes (see Appendix 2 Table 1b). Group 2 was injected in the<br>
left side of the neck near the base of the ear with Abamectin L.A. (200 µg/kg); Group 3 was<br>
treated with the Stand-by Pour-on formulation (500 µg/kg MSD Ag Vet) in accordance with<br>
the manufacturer's recommendation and Group 1 remained as the untreated control.<br>
Husbandry - Feed and water: The animals were maintained on pasture for the duration of the<br>
trial with ready access to drinking water. The groups treated with pour-on anthelmintics were<br>
kept on separate pastures for approximately 12 hours after treatment to avoid the transfer of the<br>
pour-on formulations to those in other groups. At all other times the calves were maintained as<br>
one herd.<br>
Reactions to treatments: All animals were observed for adverse reactions to the anthelmintics<br>
immediately after treatment and when they were returned to pasture. At time of slaughter<br>
Group 2 calves (Abamectin injectable) had the left side of the neck skinned in order to assess<br>
any reaction to the treatment.<br>
Faecal Sampling: All animals were faecal sampled on Day -7, Day 0 and Day 5. Faecal egg<br>
counts were carried out using a modified McMaster technique in which each egg counted<br>
represents 50 eggs per gram faeces.<br>
Necropsies: The calves were necropsied on Days 7 and 8 following anthelmintic treatment.<br>
The groups were arbitrarily divided into two with half of each group slaughtered on each day.<br>
The animals were euthanased by stunning with a captive bolt pistol followed by ex-<br>
sanguination and severing of the nerve chord. Worm counts of the gastro intestinal tracts and<br>
lungs were carried out using the method described by Brunsdon, (1972) and in accordance with<br>
the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology guidelines (Wood et al.<br>
(1995)). Lungs and the abomasal mucosa were processed using the techniques described by<br>
Downey (1981) and Oakley (1989).<br>
Briefly the lungs together with the heart and the gastrointestinal tract were removed and the<br>
abomasum, small intestine and large intestine ligatured and separated. The lungs were infused<br>
after the method of Oakley (1989) using mains pressure water directed through the pulmonary<br>
artery. Approximately 8 litres were passed through each lung. The bronchial tree was then<br>
opened with scissors and examined to ensure no worms remained. The total contents and<br>
washings of the abomasum and small intestine were also collected separately, made up to 8<br>
litres and a 1/10 aliquot passed through a 45µ sieve and preserved with formalin for counting.<br>
The contents and washings of the abomasum and small intestine were also collected separately,<br>
made up to 8 litres and a 1/10 aliquot passed through a 45µ sieve and preserved with formalin<br>
for counting. The contents of the large intestine were made up to 8 litres and half passed<br>
through 635µ sieve and preserved with formalin for counting. The abomasal mucosa of each<br>
animal was incubated in 1.5 litres of physiological saline at 37°C over night (Downey, 1981)<br>
and then treated as with the contents.<br>
Nematode Counts: Nematodes present in the total contents of the washings from the lungs,<br>
the 1/2 aliquot sample of the large intestine, a 1/5 subsample of the abomasal contents,<br>
abomasal mucosa and a 1/10 subsample of the small intestine were identified to developmental<br>
stage and genus and counted. Counts were multiplied by the appropriate aliquot factor to give<br>
total numbers present in each organ. The first 20 adult male worms of the genera Ostertagia<br>
and Cooperia in each sample (depending on availability) were identified to species using the<br>
spicule morphology to determine the species composition of the respective worm population on<br>
a proportional basis.<br>
Statistical Methods: Data for both faecal egg counts and worm counts were transformed to<br>
Loge(X+100) to normalise their distributions before analyses were carried out. FEC's and<br>
worm counts were analysed by 1-way ANOVA's using the Minitab 10.5 statistical package.<br>
FEC's and worm counts given in tables are the back transformed values. The percentage<br>
efficacy were calculated as:<br>
(Mean of Control - Mean of Treatment/Mean of Control) x 100<br>
Results:<br>
Faecal culture:<br>
Results of the pre-treatment faecal culture indicated that the following genera of<br>
gastrointestinal nematodes were present in the experimental herd - Haemonchus contortus,<br>
Ostertagia spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Cooperia spp., and Oesophagostomum spp. (Table 2).<br>
Faecal egg counts (FEC's)<br>
Pre- and post- treatment FEC's and percentage faecal egg count reductions (FECR) are<br>

Worm counts<br>
The geometric mean worm burdens recovered from the abomasum, small intestine, large<br>
intestine and the lungs and the percentage reduction are presented in Tables 4-7. A small<br>
number of parasites of sheep origin were present in the calves which had been in a mixed<br>
grazing management system. Treated animals had significantly fewer adult, late 4th and early<br>
4th stage worms of Ostertagia spp, Haemonchus contortus, and Cooperia spp. Only in the<br>
case of Cooperia spp was there a difference between treatment groups there being significantly<br>
fewer adult and late 4th stage worms of Trichostrongylus axei in all treated groups but not early<br>
4th stage larvae. Due to the trial design it cannot be verified that this is due to the lower<br>
efficacy of the treatments against this developmental stage at the calves may have acquired<br>
some larvae while grazing on pasture between the treatment date and the time of their<br>
slaughter. All three treatments also showed significant efficacy against adult Dictyocaulus<br>

SPECIES COMPOSITION (OSTERTAGIA AND COOPERIA).<br>
Four species of Ostertagia and three species of Cooperia were identified from the worm<br>
burdens of the calves in the trial - i.e. O. ostertagi, O. lyrata, O. leptospicularis, O. kolchida,<br>
C. oncophora, C. mcmasteri, and C. punctata. O. ostertagi and C. oncophora were the<br>
predominant species present representing approximately 60% and 75% of the respective<br>
genera (Table 8). All three anthelmintic treatments appeared equally effective against all<br>
species of Ostertagia and similar proportions of all Cooperia species remained after treatment.<br>

identification of adult males).<br>
* = No adult males found<br>
** = Only adult male found<br>
Injection sites<br>
No adverse reaction to either the injectable or pour-on formulations was observed at the time of<br>
treatment. At the time of slaughter the injection sites of group 2 calves were examined by<br>
removing the skin from the neck of each animal. No reactions to treatment were found.<br>
We have found that we can produce long acting injectable solutions containing between<br>
0.5-5% of an anthelmintic chosen from the class of monocyclic lactones including but not<br>
limited to avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin, and moxidectin, by<br>
using from 1-30% benzyl alcohol and a vegetable oil such as sesame oil or soya bean oil, and<br>
by optionally using from 5-30% of a wetting agent such as ethyl oleate. Optionally, oil soluble<br>
vitamins such as Vitamins A, D, E and K1 may be added.<br>
Oral Formulations:<br>
Example 6:<br>

We have found that we can produce long acting solutions for oral administration containing<br>
between 0.1-5% of an anthelmintic chosen from the class of monocyclic lactones including but<br>
not limited to avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin, and moxidectin, by<br>
using from 1-30% benzyl alcohol and a vegetable oil such as corn oil, sesame oil or soya bean<br>
oil, and by optionally using from 5-30% of a wetting agent such as ethyl oleate. Optionally, oil<br>
soluble vitamins such as Vitamins A, D, E and K1 may be added.<br>
Pour-on Formulations:<br>
Example 13:<br>
Abamectin 1.0%<br>
Benzyl Alcohol 20%<br>
Soya Bean Oil to 100%<br>
Example 14:<br>
Ivermectin 1.0%<br>
Benzyl Alcohol 20%<br>
Soya Bean Oil to 100%<br>
Example 15:<br>

We have found that we can produce long acting pour-on solutions containing between<br>
0.5-5% of an anthelmintic chosen from the class of monocyclic lactones including but not<br>
limited to avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin, and moxidectin, by<br>
using from 1-30% benzyl alcohol and a vegetable oil such as sesame oil or soya bean oil, and<br>
by optionally using from 5-30% of a wetting agent such as ethyl oleate. Optionally, oil soluble<br>
vitamins such as Vitamins A, D, E and K1 may be added.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The relatively high viscosity of vegetable oils such as sesame oil makes them unsuitable for use<br>
as a solvent for injection using typical veterinary syringes. However, a co-solvent chosen from<br>
the class of alcohols having 4 or more carbon atoms, and preferably benzyl alcohol, decreases<br>
the viscosity of the vegetable oil such that the vegetable oil becomes a suitable solvent for<br>
injection.<br>
The active anthelmintic ingredient remains in solution in formulations of this invention even<br>
when stored for long periods or in cold conditions.<br>
The formulations of this invention also allow the controlled release of the active anthelmintic<br>
in the blood stream of the animal.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION<br>
The formulations shown above are effective in the treatment of helmithiasis in cattle and other<br>
domestically important animals including, but not limited to, goats and pigs.<br>
VARIATIONS<br>
Whilst the above examples have concentrated on the use of ivermectin and abamectin, it will<br>
be appreciated that the same technique can be used to provide stable formulations for<br>
injectable, pour-on or oral administration containing an anthelmintic chosen from the group<br>
comprising avermectins, ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, milbemycin, and moxidectin.<br>
Although we prefer to use sesame oil in these formulations other vegetable oils such as soya<br>
bean oil, corn oil and rape oil are possible as are other viscous vegetable oils.<br>
Benzyl alcohol is the preferred co-solvent, however other co-solvents may be used in some<br>
formulations.<br>
Finally it will be appreciated that various other alterations and modifications may be made to<br>
the forgoing without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.<br>
