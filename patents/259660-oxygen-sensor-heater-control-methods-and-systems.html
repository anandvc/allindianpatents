OXYGEN SENSOR HEATER CONTROL METHODS AND SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
controlling an oxygen sensor heater.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Engine control systems manage air and fuel delivery to the<br>
engine based on either open loop or closed loop feedback control methods.<br>
Open loop control methods are typically initiated during specific operating<br>
conditions such as start up, cold engine operation, heavy load conditions,<br>
wide open throttle, and intrusive diagnostic events, etc. An engine control<br>
system typically employs closed loop control methods to maintain the air/fuel<br>
mixture at or close to an ideal stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. Closed loop fuel<br>
control commands a desired fuel delivery based on an oxygen content in the<br>
exhaust. The oxygen content in the exhaust is determined by oxygen sensors<br>
that are located downstream of the engine.<br>
[0004] Oxygen sensors generate a voltage signal proportional to the<br>
amount of oxygen in the exhaust. Oxygen sensors typically compare the<br>
oxygen content in the exhaust with an oxygen content in the outside air. As<br>
the amount of unburned oxygen in the exhaust increases, the voltage output<br>
of the sensor drops. Most oxygen sensors must be heated before they can<br>
effectively operate. Heater elements present in the oxygen sensor heat the<br>
sensor to a desired operating temperature.<br>
[0005] Cracking of oxygen sensor elements may occur due to<br>
thermal shock. Cracking is thought to be due to water droplets, which are<br>
produced by combustion and borne by the exhaust gas stream, coming in<br>
contact with a ceramic element of the oxygen sensor. While the engine<br>
warms up, moisture can be present in the exhaust system. In some cases,<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
the liquid moisture, entrained by the passing gas flow, may come in to direct<br>
contact with the oxygen sensor elements. If the element has, by this point in<br>
time, reached a hot enough temperature, the water droplet can cause the<br>
ceramic element to crack.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a control system for an oxygen sensor heater is<br>
provided. The control system includes a passive heater control module that<br>
generates a heater control signal at a first duty cycle and measures a<br>
resistance of the oxygen sensor heater. An exhaust gas temperature (EGT)<br>
mapping module maps the resistance to an exhaust gas temperature. An<br>
active heater control module generates a heater control signal at a second<br>
duty cycle based on the exhaust gas temperature.<br>
[0007] In other features, an engine system is provided. The engine<br>
system includes an engine. At least one oxygen sensor is disposed<br>
downstream of the engine wherein the oxygen sensor includes an oxygen<br>
sensor heater. A control module measures a resistance of the oxygen sensor<br>
heater, maps the resistance to an exhaust gas temperature, and selectively<br>
delays activation of the oxygen sensor heater based on the exhaust gas<br>
temperature and a dewpoint temperature threshold.<br>
[0008] In still other features, a method of controlling an oxygen<br>
sensor heater is provided. The method includes: measuring a resistance of<br>
an oxygen sensor heater; mapping the resistance to an exhaust gas<br>
temperature; selectively delaying activation of the oxygen sensor heater<br>
based on the exhaust gas temperature and a dewpoint temperature threshold;<br>
and activating the oxygen sensor heater once the exhaust gas temperature<br>
exceeds the dewpoint temperature threshold.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference<br>
numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes a control<br>
module 12, an engine 14, a fuel system 16, and an exhaust system 18. A<br>
throttle 20 communicates with the control module 12 to control air flow into an<br>
intake manifold 15 of the engine 14. The amount of torque produced by the<br>
engine 14 is proportional to mass air flow (MAF) into the engine 14. The<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
engine 14 operates in a lean condition (i.e. reduced fuel) when the A/F ratio is<br>
higher than a stoichiometric A/F ratio. The engine 14 operates in a rich<br>
condition when the A/F ratio is less than the stoichiometric A/F ratio. Internal<br>
combustion within the engine 14 produces exhaust gas that flows from the<br>
engine 14 to the exhaust system 18, which treats the exhaust gas and<br>
releases the exhaust gas to the atmosphere. The control module 12<br>
communicates with the fuel system 16 to control the fuel supply to the<br>
engine 14.<br>
[0018] The exhaust system 18 includes an exhaust manifold 22, a<br>
catalytic converter 24, and one or more oxygen sensors. The catalytic<br>
converter 24 controls emissions by increasing the rate of oxidization of<br>
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the rate of reduction of<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOX). To enable oxidization, the catalytic converter 24<br>
requires oxygen. The oxygen sensors provide feedback to the control module<br>
indicating a level of oxygen in the exhaust. Based on the oxygen sensor<br>
signals, the control module controls air and fuel at a desired air-to-air (A/F)<br>
ratio in an effort to provide optimum engine performance as well as to provide<br>
optimum catalytic converter performance. Controlling air and fuel based on<br>
one or more oxygen sensor feedback signals is referred to as operating in a<br>
closed loop mode. It is appreciated that the present disclosure contemplates<br>
various oxygen sensors that can be located at various locations within the<br>
exhaust system 18.<br>
[0019] In an exemplary embodiment, as shown in Figure 1, the<br>
exhaust system includes an inlet oxygen (O2) sensor 26 located upstream<br>
from the catalytic converter 24, and an outlet (O2) sensor 28 located<br>
downstream from the catalytic converter 24. The inlet O2 sensor 26<br>
communicates with the control module 12 and measures the O2 content of the<br>
exhaust stream entering the catalytic converter 24. The outlet O2 sensor 28<br>
communicates with the control module 12 and measures the O2 content of the<br>
exhaust stream exiting the catalytic converter 24: The control module 12<br>
controls air and fuel based on the inlet and outlet oxygen sensor signals such<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
that a sufficient level of O2 is present in the exhaust to initiate oxidation in the<br>
catalytic converter 24.<br>
[0020] Oxygen sensors 26, 28 include an internal heating element<br>
that allows the sensors to reach a desired operating temperature more quickly<br>
and to maintain the desired temperature during periods of idle or low engine<br>
load. As shown in Figure 1, the inlet O2 sensor 26 and the outlet O2 sensor<br>
28 include O2 heaters 30, 32 respectively. The control module 12 controls<br>
power to the O2 heaters 30, 32 based on the oxygen sensor heater control<br>
systems and methods of the present disclosure.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, a dataflow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of an oxygen sensor heater control system that may be<br>
embedded within the control module 12. Various embodiments of oxygen<br>
sensor heater control systems according to the present disclosure may<br>
include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 12.<br>
The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to<br>
similarly control functions of O2 heaters 30, 32 (Figure 1) during warm-up<br>
conditions. Inputs to the system may be sensed from the vehicle 10 (Figure<br>
1), received from other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle 10<br>
(Figure 1), and/or determined by other sub-modules (not shown) within the<br>
control module 12. In various embodiments, the control module 12 of Figure<br>
2 includes an enable module 33, a passive heater control module 35, an<br>
exhaust gas temperature (EGT) mapping module 34, and an active heater<br>
control module 36.<br>
[0022] The enable module 33 selectively enables the passive heater<br>
control module 35 to control at least one of the O2 heaters 30, 32 via an<br>
enable flag 42. The enable module 33 monitors engine warm-up conditions<br>
and sets the enable flag 42 to TRUE once engine warm-up conditions are<br>
met. Otherwise, the enable flag 42 remains set to FALSE. Engine warm-up<br>
conditions can be based on, but are not limited to, engine off time, intake air<br>
temperature, and engine coolant temperature.<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0023] The passive heater control module 35 controls at least one of<br>
the O2 heaters 30, 32 via a heater control signal 46 to measure a resistance<br>
of the O2 heater. The passive heater control module 35 generates the heater<br>
control signal 46 at a minimum duty cycle such that a resistance 44 can be<br>
measured while minimizing self-heating of the O2 heater. The passive heater<br>
control module 35 determines the duty cycle based on a predetermined time<br>
and/or frequency. The time and/or frequency can be predetermined based on<br>
the control system and heater properties. Figure 3A illustrates an exemplary<br>
heater control signal 100 generated by the passive heater control module 35.<br>
As shown, a minimal duty cycle is commanded at smaller frequencies. After<br>
generating the heater control signal, the resistance 44 of the O2 heater can be<br>
measured based on the current 48 flowing to the heater (amps) and the<br>
voltage 50 at the oxygen sensor. For example, resistance 44 can be<br>
determined from the fundamental electrical equation:<br>
V - I * R → R = V / I.<br>
Where V equals voltage and I equals current. Methods and systems for<br>
measuring O2 heater resistance are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,586,711, and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0024] Referring back to Figure 2, the EGT mapping module 34<br>
maps the measured resistance 44 to one of an O2 heater temperature or an<br>
O2 element temperature. In various embodiments, the measured resistance<br>
44 is mapped to the O2 heater temperature based on a lookup table defined<br>
by resistance 44. The EGT mapping module 34 then associates the O2<br>
heater temperature or O2 element temperature with an exhaust gas<br>
temperature. As can be seen in the graph of Figure 4, the exhaust gas<br>
temperature derived from the measured resistance shown at 106 tracks the<br>
actual exhaust gas temperature at 104.<br>
[0025] Referring back to Figure 3, based on the exhaust gas<br>
temperature, the EGT mapping module 34 sets an activate heater flag 54.<br>
More particularly, once the exhaust gas temperature exceeds a dewpoint<br>
temperature threshold 52, the activate heater flag 54 is set to TRUE.<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
Otherwise the activate heater flag 54 remains set to FALSE. Waiting until the<br>
exhaust gas temperature exceeds the dewpoint temperature threshold 52<br>
provides a sufficient delay for water present on the O2 sensor to evaporate.<br>
As can be appreciated, the dewpoint temperature threshold can be<br>
predetermined based on O2 heater properties<br>
[0026] The active heater control module 36 generates a heater<br>
control signal 46 to activate the O2 heater once the activate heater flag 54 is<br>
TRUE. As shown in Figure 3B, the active heater control module 36 generates<br>
a heater control signal 102 at a duty cycle sufficient to maintain an operating<br>
temperature of the O2 sensor. The duty cycle is determined based on the<br>
current 48 and voltage 50. Once the O2 heater is activated via the heater<br>
control signal 46, the control module 12 can begin controlling fuel and air<br>
according to closed loop control methods.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 5, a flowchart illustrates an oxygen<br>
sensor heater control method as performed by the control module 12 of<br>
Figure 2. The method may be run periodically during engine warm-up<br>
conditions. Warm-up conditions are evaluated at 200. If warm-up conditions<br>
exist at 200, control commands a heater control signal to the O2 heater<br>
according to a time and/or frequency sufficient to measure a resistance at<br>
202. Control measures the O2 heater resistance based on an applied voltage<br>
and current draw at 204. Control maps the measured resistance to an<br>
exhaust gas temperature (EGT) at 206. The EGT is evaluated at 208. If the<br>
EGT is greater than a predetermined dewpoint temperature threshold at 208,<br>
control activates the O2 heater according to active heater control methods at<br>
210.<br>
[0028] Otherwise, control loops back and continues to command a<br>
heater control signal according to passive heater control methods at 202.<br>
Once the O2 heater is turned on at 210 and the operating temperature of the<br>
O2 sensor reaches a predetermined threshold, closed loop control may begin.<br>
Prior to activating the heater, open loop control is performed. As can be<br>
appreciated, if warm-up conditions do not exist at 200, control can skip over<br><br>
GP-308143-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
passive heater control at 202-208 and proceed to operate the heater based<br>
on active heater control methods at 210.<br>
[0029] As can be appreciated, all comparisons made above can be<br>
implemented in various forms depending on the selected values for the<br>
comparison. For example, a comparison of "greater than" may be<br>
implemented as "greater than or equal to" in various embodiments.<br>
[0030] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>
of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will<br>
become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings,<br>
specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
