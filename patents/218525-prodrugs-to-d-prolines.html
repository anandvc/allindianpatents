lower alkenyloxy, benzyloxy, hydroxy, -OCH(CH3)OC(0)-lower alkyl or<br>
-OCH2C(0)N(R3)(R4), with the proviso that only one of Rl or R2 maybe     <br>

n is 1,2 or 3; and<br>
m is 4 - 8.<br>
as well as pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of said compounds.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be used for the treatment of diseases where Serum Amyloid P Component depletion has a beneficial effect, in particular in the treatment or prevention of all forms of central and systemic amyloidosis. The most common disorders associated with amyloidosis are Alzheimer"s disease, maturity onset diabetes mellitus or amyloidosis<br>
-	as a significant cause of non-ischaemic heart failure,<br>
-	as complication of long term haemodialysis in renal failure,<br><br>
-	as complication of monoclonal gammopathies,<br>
-	from chronic inflammatory disorders,<br>
-	from chronic infections<br>
-	or from certain types of cancer.	"<br>
Furthermore, amyloidosis comprises many different diseases such as forms of hereditary amyloidosis most common familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), scrapie and Kreuzfeld-Jakob disease.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be used in certain bacterial infections (M. Noursadeghi et. al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 14584-14589).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that compounds of formulae I and IA were, in<br>
vitro and in vivo, readily converted to the parent compound of formula	(<br><br>
and can therefore be used as prodrugs.<br>
The D-proline of formula II (parent compound) is a known compound and is disclosed in EP 915 088.<br>
Compounds of formula II have a limited bioavailability. It was therefore useful to find derivatives of the compound of formula II to render these compounds suitable for oral      <br>
i.	<br>
application.<br>
A molecule with optimal structural configuration and physicochemical properties for eliciting the desired therapeutic response at its target site does not necessarily possess the best molecular form and properties for its delivery to its point of ultimate action. Usually, only a minor fraction of doses administered reach the target area and since most agents interact with non-target sites as well, an inefficient delivery may result in undesirable side effects. This fact of differences in transport and in situ effect characteristics for many drug moleculs is the basic reason why bioreversible chemical derivatization of drugs, i.e, prodrug formation, is a means by which a substantial improvement in the overall efficacy of drugs can be achieved.<br>
Therefore, in the prodrug approach is involved	,.<br>
1. enhancement ofbioavailability and passage through various biological barriers, ~^"<br><br><br>
2.	increased duration of pharmacological effects,	         <br>
3.	increased site-specificity)   <br>
4.	decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, -<br>
5.	improvement of organoleptic properties, and  <br>
6.	improvement of stability and solubility. <br>
A prodrug is in most cases a pharmacologically inactive derivative of a parent drug molecule that requires spontaneous or enzymatic transformation within the body in order to release the active drug, and that has improved delivery properties over the parent drug molecule. Prodrugs are designed to overcome pharmaceutically and/or pharmacokinetically based problems associated with the parent drug molecule that would otherwise limit the clinical usefulness of the drug.<br>
In recent years several types of Moreversible derivatives have been exploited for utilization in designing prodrugs. Using esters as a prodrug type for drugs containing carboxyl or hydroxyl function is most popular. Further well-known are prodrug derivatives of peptides, 4-imidazolidinones and the like, described in Drugs of the Future, 1991,16(5), 443-458 or N-oxides, described for example in US 5.691.336.<br>

bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium in dichloromethane. The reaction is carried out at about 50 °C.<br>
The double bond in compounds of Examples 20, 21 and 22 may then be hydrogenated with palladium/carbon in ethylacetate in conventional manner to compounds of Examples 23, 24 and 25.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts may be used as prodrugs of the parent compounds of formula II, which        ^ •-possess valuable pharmacological properties.<br>
These compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
The evidence, that the compounds of formula I may be used as prodrugs of their parent compounds of formula II is shown in accordance with the description given hereinafter.<br>
f	The conversion of prodrugs to the corresponding parent compounds is due to a       ^ ^<br>
hydrolytic mechanism and there is well known evidence from the literature that similar reactions occur in vivo.<br><br>
Test description:<br>
Stability of the prodrugs in blood and plasma samples<br>
Plasma and blood samples from different species were spiked with equimolar amounts (10 μM) of prodrug and parent drug in DMSO and incubated for different time intervals (up to 60 min.) at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by protein precipitation with acetonitrile followed by centrifugation (20 min., 1800 g at 10 °C). The supernatant was immediately subjected to analysis.<br>
The concentration of formed parent was determined by LC-MS: The chromatographic system consisted of a trapping column (X-Terra™ MS C8 3.5 μm, 10 x 2.1 mm i.d., Waters) and an analytical column (Symmetry C8 3.5 urn, 50 x 2.1 mm i.d., Waters) connected to a SCIEX API 2000 triplequadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray interface. The mobile phases were 1 % aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile. The parent compound together with its deuterium labelled internal standard was enriched on the trapping column and eluted with a fast gradient. The retention time of (R)-l-[6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid was ~ 2.1 min.<br>
The effluent (300 p.1 min") was passed to the turbo ion spray interface without splitting and was nebulized using nitrogen. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode was used for mass spectrometric detection. The transitions for the parent were 341.1 [M+H)+ to 226.1 [Fragment]* and for the internal standard 349.1 [M+H]+ to 234.1 [Fragment]*. The results were expressed as half-lifes (50 % conversion of the prodrug), using the data of the prodrug at time-point 0 min. as 0 % value.<br>
Test description for microsome incubation<br>
Rat and human liver microsome incubations were conducted on-line in a CTC PAL autosampler in order to avoid any degradation of the prodrugs during the work-up. Incubation mixtures consisted of liver microsomes (rat 1.0 mg prot/mL or human 2.0 mg prot/mL), prodrug lOuM, MgCl2 (3.3 mM), and an NADPH regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADPH and glucose-6-phosphate (equivalent to 1 mM NADPH) in a total volume of 1.0 mL of potassium phosphate buffer 100 mM pH 7.4. Reactions were initiated by addition of the NADPH regenerating system at 37 °C. At time 1,5, 9,13, 17, 21, 25, and 29 min a 5 uL aliquot was directly analysed on a HPLC-MS/MS system consisting of a HP 1100 quaternary pump with degasser and a PE-Sciex API-2000 MS/MS spectrometer. The analytical column was a Waters Symmetry Shield RP8 (2.1*50mm with a 3.5 uM particle size). A polarity non linear gradient from phase A (MeOH/Ac. Form.l % 20/80) to phase B (MeOH) was applied for a total run time<br><br>
of 2 minutes at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The PE-Sciex API-2000 MS/MS spectrometer was used for detection of both the prodrugs and the parent compound (R)-l-[6-[(R)-2-:arboxy-pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. In vivo metabolic :Iearance was predicted according to published procedures (Houston, J.B., Biochem. Pharmacol., 47:1469-1479, 1994). In brief, the intrinsic clearance (Clearance, Table 1) is Calculated from the measured in vitro half-life talcing into account incubation volume and Microsomal protein used for the in vitro incubation. The intrinsic clearance is expressed in erms of ul/min/mg microsomal protein. For In vivo extrapolations, the hepatic extraction catio (E) was calculated. Here we report the %MAB value which is equal to 1-E.<br><br>
X has been found, that the compounds of the formula I exhibit low stability in plasma where they give rise to the formation of the parent compound II. With microsomes they show a medium to low stability with the formation of compound II. The bioavailability was<br><br>
measured for selected examples: 12 (100 %), 3 (8 %), 5 (8 %) and 13 (10 %). For comparison, parent compound of formula II: 4 %.<br>
These findings suggest that the compounds of formula I show an increased oral bioavailability and therefore have potential value for the treatment of diseases where SAP depletion has a beneficial effect in particular as described above.<br>
In accordance with the tests the compounds of formula I can function as prodrugs of their parent compounds of formula II.<br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutical^ usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi¬solid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, fiavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily-dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
The following Examples 1 to 25 illustrate the present invention without limiting it. All temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
The following prodrugs have been prepared:<br>
