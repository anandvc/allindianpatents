A STABLE INJECTABLE ANTISPASMODIC AND ANALGESIC FORMULATION AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
SANJEEV KHANDELWAL<br>
an Indian National<br>
of Prem Nivas, 13, Altamount Road, Mumbai 400026,<br>
Maharashtra, India,<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
1 SEP 2006<br><br>
This invention relates to a synergistic combination of an antispasmodic and an analgesic formulation in stable injectable form and to a method of making the same particularly for the treatment of colicky pain.<br>
Colicky abdominal pain may be caused by spasm of smooth muscles of various internal abdominal organs such as intestinal colic, biliary colic, renal colic and dysmenorrhoea.<br>
In the prior art it was not possible to obtain a stable camyfofin dihydrochloride and diclofenac in injectable form having a useful extended shelf life. Camylofin dihydrochloride hydrolyzes in water and loses its potency quickly in solution with increasing pH more than 4.5. Similarly the diclofenac sodium loses its potency quickly in solution with lower pH that is less than 8.0. This has acted as a deterrent in making both combination of camylofin dihydrochloride and diclofenac sodium in an injectable form. The loss of potency is nearly ten percent within a month of manufacture.<br>
Also it has been studied that combination of the said active ingredients in a single solution causes precipitate formation which is insoluble and can not be re-dispersible thereby making a solution containing a combination of both physically as well as chemically incompatible.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a formulation comprising of a combination of a strongly acidic molecule, Camylofin dihydrochloride ( pH 1.5 to 3.5 ) and a strongly alkaline molecule, Diclofenac sodium ( pH 8.0 to 9.1) in a stable injectable form, the pH of the formulation being maintained between 5.4 to 7.5 throughout its shelf life.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a formulation as described above which is administrated into the human body either by slow intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular route.<br>
2<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a formulation containing the above ingredients along with excipients, having a stable pH and in which occurrence of any precipitation reaction is inhibited.<br>
The formulation in accordance with this invention mainly comprises at least one adjuvant solvent, at least one antioxidant(s), optionally one chelating agent, at least one preservative(s), at least one surfactant, a pH adjusting/ buffering agent and a carrier aqueous base (water for injection).<br>
According to this invention there is provided a stable injectable antispasmodic and analgesic formulation comprising<br>
[a]	10 to 30 mg of camylofin dihydrochloride per ml of the injection;<br>
[b]	15 to 30 mg of Diclofenac sodium per ml of the injection;<br>
[c]	at least one adjuvant glycolic co-solvent from 20 % to 65 % of the total volume of the injectable formulation;<br>
[d]	at least one pH-adjusting/buffering agent for maintaining the pH of the formulation between 5.4 to 7.5 throughout its shelf life;<br>
[e]	at least one antioxidant from 0.1 wt% to 5 wt% of the total volume of the formulation;<br>
[f]	at least one surfactant from 1% to 10 % of the total volume of the formulation; and<br>
[g]	optionally,  at least one preservative from 0.01% to 5 wt % of the total volume of the formulation.<br>
The glycolic co-solvents along with the water for injection, which may be one or in combination of solvents selected from a group of glycols consisting of propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols - 300, polyethylene glycols - 400 glycerin and other oil based solvents suitable for parenteral.<br>
Unexpectedly and surprisingly, it is found that the co solvents prevent the hydrolysis of camylofin and therefore the camylofin remains stable and potent throughout the period of the shelf life of the product.<br>
3<br><br>
The injectable formulation contains antioxidants that mainly prevent the oxidation of the active drug and to stabilize the formulation throughout the shelf life of the formulation. The anti-oxidant used in the formulation is selected from a group consisting of sodium metabisulfide, sodium sulfide, and sodium disulfide.<br>
The formulation contains at least one chelating agent that forms a complex with the oxidizing agent and thus prevents oxidation of the active drug and also potentiates the stabilizing action of the other antioxidants used thus stabilizing the formulation throughout the shelf life of the formulation. The chelating agent used in the formulation is preferably sodium salt of EDTA (ethylene diamino tetra acetic acid) is optionally included.<br>
The formulation contains at least one surfactant that mainly solubilizes the drug in the medium and thus prevents the precipitation of drug that may occur during the storage of the formulation. The surfactant used in the formulation is selected from the group of polysorbates. The formulation preferably contains polysorbate 80.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises the incorporation of ingredients or excipients for adjusting the pH. The pH of the injection is the single most crucial parameter for stability of the drug in the formulation. The formulation of this invention comprises pH-adjusting agent in its dilute solution that may be preferably sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, ammonium acetate, glacial acetic acid, ammonium acetate, sodium acetate and phosphates. The pH of the formulation is kept within the range of 5.4 to 7.5 throughout its shelf life.<br>
The formulation contains preservatives that mainly prevent the deterioration of the formulation from microbial contamination. The preservative used in the formulation is a pharmaceutically acceptable material and is preferably selected from the group consisting of benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben. The preservative may be used optionally in the formulation where the quantity of the said adjuvant solvents is more than 40 % of the total volume. The adjuvant solvent itself acting as a preservative. A preferred<br>
4<br><br>
content of added preservative is from 0.001 % to 5% of the total volume of the formulation.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a process for making a stable injectable antispasmodic and analgesic formulation comprising camylofin dihydrochloride and diclofenac sodium which comprises the steps carried out throughout in an inert atmospehere,<br>
[a]	dissolving dispensed quantity of camylofin dihydrochloride in fresh water for injection to obtain a clear solution;<br>
[b]	transferring the clear solution to a stainless steel reaction vessel containing a dispensed quantity of an adjuvant co solvent;<br>
[c]	stirring the clear solution and co solvent for 10 to 30 minutes to obtain a homogenous solution;<br><br>
[d]	mixing together dispensed quantities of an antioxidant and a chelating agent in fresh water for injection to form an antioxidant-chelating agent solution and adding the antioxidant-chelating agent solution to the homogenous solution of step(c) and stirring for 10 to 30 minutes to obtain an active ingredient- antioxidant-chelating agent solution;<br>
[e]	adding an alkaline pH adjusting agent to the active ingredient-antioxidant-chelating agent solution to raise the pH of the said solution up to 4.0;<br>
[f]	adding diclofenac sodium to co-solvent and slowly adding fresh water for injection with stirring to get a clear diclofenac sodium solution;<br>
[g]	slowly adding the diclofenac sodium solution to the pH adjusted active ingredient- antioxidant-chelating agent solution of camylofin dihydrochloride to form a solution of active agents;<br>
[h] adding dispensed quantity of a surfactant dissolved in fresh water for injection to the solution of active ingredients;<br>
[i] optionally adding a preservative to the solution of active agents;<br>
0] checking the pH of the solution of active agents;<br>
[k] adjusting the pH of the solution of the active agents to provide a pH adjusted stable injectable formulation having pH adjusted to lie between pH 5.4 to 7; and<br>
5<br><br>
[i] filtering the injectable formulation through a sterile membrane filter assembly using nitrogen pressure and collecting the filtered injectable solution to form the stable injectable antispasmodic and analgesic formuation for filing in sterile nitrogen flushed ampules.<br>
