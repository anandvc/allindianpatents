				<td>This invention relates to compositions for oral administration in the form of chewable emulsions containing physiologically tolerable unsaturated fatty add ester oils.<br>
The term unsaturated fatty add ester oil is used herein to relate to acyl glycosides and phospholipids, i.e. compoundsjcomprising an unsaturated fatty add side chain linked by an ester group to an "alcohol" (e.g. polyol) residue. Such compounds are important dietarysourcesof fatty adds, in particular polyunsaturated fatty adds (PUFAs) and more espedally the essential fatty adds. They may also serve as sources for dietary replacements of essential fatty adds, e.g. of conjugated linoldc add (CLA) which may be used in a weight reduction diet Particularly important essential fatty adds include the -3, -6 and 9 adds such as dcosapentaenoic add (EPA) and docosahexaenoic add (DBA). Other fatty adds commonly used in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals include arachidonic add (AA), alpha linolenic add (ALA), conjugated linolenic acid (CLN), dihomo-gamma linolenic add (DGLA) and gamma linolenic add (GLA). Such fatty acids typically will contain 12 to 26 carbons, more typically 16 to 22 carbons, and will have a saturated or mono- or poly-elayleriicallyrunsaturated hydrocarbyl chain.<br>
Typical dietary sources of such fatty add ester oils include lipids such as animal, fish, plant or microorganism lriglyceades and phospholipids, especially the triglycerides. Mono or diglycerides however can equally be used as can other esters, e.g. lower alkyl (e.g. C1-6 alkyl, for example ethyl) esters as well as free fatty adds or physiologically acceptable salts thereof and fatty add ester waxes. Particularly important sources are fish oils, inparu'cular oily fish oils such as cod-liver oil, halibut-liver oil, etc. as these are rich in -3, -6 and -9 fatty adds.<br>
However, as anyone who, in childhood, has been on the recdving end of fish oils will recall, the taste, mouthfeel and smell can be vile. In past this is due to the sensitivity to oxidation of the fish oil. As a result fatty add ester oils tend to be administered in capsule form, containing liquid oil within a soft gel casing. Such<br>
capsule casings are usually made from mammalian gelatin, typically of porcine or bovine origin. In order to deliver a reasonable dose of the oil, tile capsules tend to be rather large, sufficiently large indeed to cause problems swallowing them for the young and the elderly. As a result, ingestion often involves the capsule being chewed and bursting in the mouth releasing the unpleasantly tasting oil contents.<br>
There is thus a continuing need for improved oral administration forms for unsaturated fatty acid ester oils.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that chewable set emulsions of unsaturated fatty acid esters remain sufficiently free of bad odour and taste.<br>
Thus viewed from one aspect the invention provides an orally administrable chewable composition in unit dosage form comprising an oil-in-water emulsion in which the aqueous phase is gelled and in which the oil phase comprises a physiologically tolerable unsaturated fatty acid ester.<br>
The term "chewable" is used herein in its conventional meaning within the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. That is the composition is in a form which can be broken or fragmented by chewing.<br>
The chewable compositions of the invention may be pharmaceuticals, but preferably are nutraceuticals.<br>
The oil phase of the emulsion will typically comprise a physiologically tolerable unsaturated fatty acid ester oil as described above, especially an acyl glyceride or a fatty acid ethyl ester, and in particular a fish or plant triglyceride. More preferably, it contains a fish oil. Besides such oils, or mixtures thereof, the oil phase may also if desired contain physiologically tolerable lipid soluble materials, e.g. vitamins, antioxidants, flavourings, colours and other physiologically active materials. If desired, the oil phase may be constituted in whole or part by a phospholipid, in particular a marine (eg pelagic fish or shellfish, for example krill) phospholipid. The oil phase preferably contains 25 to 100% of the recommended daily dosage for one or more essential fatty acids, especially EPA and/or DHA. Typically the oil phase will constitute 0.05 to 5g, preferably 0.1 to 3g, especially 0.2 to 2g, particularly 0.3 to 1.25g, more particularly 0.4 to 0.75g, per dose unit. Alternatively put, the oil phase preferably constitutes 5 to 75% wt, especially 30 to 50%wt, eg 40 to 50 % wt of the dose unit<br>
The aqueous phase of the emulsion comprises water and a physiologically tolerable gelling agent, preferably a saccharide (e.g. an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide), a protein or a glycoprotein. Suitable gelling agents are well known in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries and several are described for example in Phillips et aL (Ed.) "Handbook of hydrocolloids", Woodhead Publishing, Cambridge, UK, 2000. The gelling agents are preferably materials capable of undergoing a sol-gel transformation, e.g. under the influence of a change in physiochemical parameters such as temperature, pH, presence of metal ions (e.g. group 1 or 2 metal ions), etc.<br>
Preferred for use as the gdling agent is gelatin or a mixture of gelatin and a polysaccharide, or gellan, or an alginate (eg sodium alginate), or a mixture of an alginate and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). The use of fish gelatins is especially preferred.<br>
The gelatins used as gelling agents in the composition of the invention may be produced from the collagen of any mammal or the collagen of any aquatic species, however the use of gelatin from salt-water fish and in particular cold water fish is preferred. Gelatins having an imino acid content of 5 to 25% wt are preferred, more especially those having an imino acid content of 10 to 25% wt The gelatins will typically have a weight average molecular weight in the range 10 to 250 kDa, preferably 75 to 220 kDa, especially 80 to 200 kDa. Gelatins having Bloom values of 60-300, especially 90-200 are preferred. The gelatin will typically be present in the aqueous phase at a concentration of 1 to 50% wt, preferably 2 to 35% wt, particularly 5 to 25% wt In the case of mixtures of gelatin and polysaccharides, the weight ratio of gelatin to polysaccharide in the aqueous phase will.typically be 50:1 to 5:1, preferably 40:1 to 9:1, especially 20:1 to 10:1.<br>
Where polysaccharides, or mixtures of polysaccharides and gelatin are used as the gelling agent, it is preferred to use natural polysaccharides, synthetic polysaccharides or semisynthetic polysaccharides, e.g. polysaccharides from plants, fish, terrestrial mammals, algae, bacteria and derivatives and fragmentation products thereof. Typical marine polysaccharides include carageenans, alginates, agars and chitosans. Typical plant polysaccharides include pectins. Typical microorganism polysaccharides include gellans and scleroglucans. The use of charged, e.g.<br>
% wt, particularly 0.2 to 1 % wt in the aqueous phase. Where mono or multivalent cations, typically group 1 or group 2 metal ions, are included in the aqueous phase, this will typically be at concentrations in the range 2.5 to 100 mM, particularly 5 to 50mM.<br>
Besides the gelling agent and water and any required gelling initiator, other physiologically tolerable materials may be present in the aqueous phase, e.g. emulsifiers, emulsion stabilizers, pH modifiers, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, fillers, vitamins (e.g. vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folacin, panthoterric acid), minerals, aromas, flavours, colours, physiologically active agents, etc. It is especially preferred that a lipophilic antioxidant, e.g. vitamin E, be included in the oil phase. Other vitamins which may be present in the oil phase are vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin K. Such further components are used widely in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. The use of cellulose derivatives (e.g. hydroxy methyl propyl cellulose) as emulsion stabilizers is especially preferred.<br>
The pH of the aqueous phase of the emulsion is preferably in the range 2 to 9, particularly 3 to 7.5.<br>
The aqueous phase preferably has a gelling temperature in the range 10 to 30°C, more preferably 15 to 28ºC, and a melting temperature in the range 20 to 80°C, more preferably 24 to 60°C, especially 28 to 50°C.<br>
Where a sweetener is included in the aqueous phase, this will typically be selected from natural sweeteners such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, reduced glucose, maltose, xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol, mannitol, lactitol, isomalt, erymritol, polyglycitol, polyglucitol and glycerol and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, neotame, saccharine, sucralose. The use of non-cariogenic sweeteners is preferred.<br>
The emulsion preferably has an oil content of 1 to 90% wt, especially 5 to 80% wt, more especially 20 to 75% wt However after emulsification and gelation the emulsion may be dried to reduce the water content, e.g. to 0.01 to 50% wt, preferably 0.1 to 40% wt, especially 0.5 to 30% wt. Particularly preferably however the aqueous phase, even after any drying step, will constitute at least 10% wt, more preferably at least 20% wt., especially at least 30% wt, particularly at least 40% wt. of the emulsion "residue". Where the emulsion is dried, e.g. by lyophilization, the<br>
discontinuous nature of the oil phase is maintained even though the water content of the emulsion residue may be extremely low. In general, however, where a dried gelled emulsion is used, it is preferred that it still contains a continuous gel network phase, e.g. as detectable by electron microscopy.<br>
Examples of physiologically active agents mat may be included in the capsules of the invention include for example analgesics (eg paracetamol and acetyl salicylic acid) and antihistamines.<br>
Preferably the overall dose unit weight will be 0.25 to 3g, especially 0.5 to 2.5g, more especially 0.75 to 2g.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a method of treatment of a human by oral adrninistration of an effective amount of an active agent in oil form or dissolved in an oil, the improvement comprising administering said active agent in a chewable emulsion according to the invention. The method may thus typically be a method of treatment of a disease or ailment (eg pain), a method of nutritional supplementation (eg with a triglyceride) or a method of reducing weight<br>
Emulsion formation may be effected by conventional techniques; however emulsification under a non-oxidising gas, eg nitrogen, is preferred. likewise, the components of the emulsion are preferably degassed before emulsification and handling and packaging of the set emulsion is preferably performed under such a gas.<br>
The dose units of the emulsion may be formed for example by moulding, extrusion or cutting or the like. For adult use, the dose units are preferably in tablet or lozenge form; however for child use they may conveniently be presented in child-friendly form, eg geometric shapes such as rods, strips and tubes, or animal, doll, or vehicle shapes, for example the shape of a popular cartoon character.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the compositions according to the invention contain a citrus flavour (e.g orange or lemon oil) in order to mask any remaining oil taste on chewing. It is also particularly preferred that the compositions according to the invention contain xylitol, e.g. as 0.5 to 50% wt, preferably 1 to 40% wt, eg 15 to 40%wt, in order to mask both taste and mouth feel. These may be in the aqueous phase or the oil phase (e.g. as a water-in-oil-in water emulsion), or both; however inclusion in the aqueous phase will generally be sufficient.<br>
The dose units of the compositions of the invention are preferably individually packaged in air-tight containers, eg a sealed wrapper or more preferably a blister of a blister pack. Viewed from a forther aspect the invention provides a package comprising an air-tight compartment containing one dose unit of a composition according to the invention.<br>
The packages according to the invention are preferably in the form of blister packs containing at least two dose units, eg 2 to 100, preferably 6 to 30. A blister pack, as is well known, usually comprises; a plastic sheet base having moulded indentations or trays in which the item to fee packed is placed. The pack is normally sealed with a foil, generally metal or a metaplastic laminate, generally by heating the areas between the indentations or trays.<br>
The packages according to the invention are preferably filled under a non-oxidising gas atmosphere (eg nitrogen) or are flushed with such a. gas before sealing.<br>
Of course, in place of unsaturated fatty acid esters, saturated fatty acids and their esters could also be used and this forms a further aspect of the invention.<br>

The temperature is lowered to 50°C and the vitamin C powder is added to the solution. The solution is mixed for 30 min before stirruing is stoppedVaad the solution is left for 30 min.<br>
Marine oil (e.g. commercially available fishliver oil) is mixed with 0.15% wt lemon flavour.<br>
The marine oil and the aqueous solution are emulsified in a weight ratio of 1:2 at 40-45°C using an ultra turrax. The resultant emulsion is degassed under vacuum to remove air bubbles. When the emulsion is smooth, soft cores are produced by moulding and left to gel for 60 min at 22°C The cores are dried to reduce the content of water to approximately 10% wt<br>
Example 12 Blister packs<br>
The emulsion sores of Examples 1,2 and 4 to 11 are filled into plastic blister pack trays over which a plastic/metal foi laminate is heat sealed.<br>
Example .13 Chewable strips<br>
Before setting, the emulsions of Examples 1,2 and 4 to 12 are extruded into strips which are then sealed into individualplastic/metal foil laminate envelopes.<br><br><br><br><br>
