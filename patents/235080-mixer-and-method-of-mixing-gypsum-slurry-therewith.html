				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Mixer, Mixing method and Method of Producing Gypsum Board<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a mixer, a mixing method and a method<br>
of producing gypsum boards, which are used in a continuous slurry pouring<br>
and casting type of gypsum board production process.<br>
Technical Background<br>
Gypsum boards are widely used in various kinds of buildings as<br>
architectural interior finish materials, because of their advantageous fire-<br>
resisting or fire-protecting ability, sound insulation performance, workability,<br>
cost performance and so on.   The gypsum boards are known as boards having<br>
a gypsum core covered with sheets of paper for gypsum board liner.   In<br>
general, the gypsum boards are produced by a continuous slurry pouring and<br>
casting process.   This casting process comprises the following steps:<br>
(i) a step of admixing calcined gypsum, adhesive auxiliary agent, set<br>
accelerator, foam for reducing a weight, admixtures, additives or the like, with<br>
water in a mixer, thereby preparing calcined gypsum slurry (referred to as<br>
"slurry" hereinafter);<br>
(ii) a step of pouring the slurry thus prepared in the mixer, into an area<br>
between upper and lower sheets of paper for gypsum board liner and forming<br>
them in a continuous web-like formation having a configuration of board; and<br>
(iii) a step of severing solidified continuous web-like formation, drying it<br>
forcibly and thereafter, cutting it to be a product size.<br>
Normally, a thin type of circular mixer is used as a mixer for preparing<br>
the slurry.   This type of mixer comprises a flattened circular housing and a<br>
rotary disc rotatably provided in the housing.   A plurality of feeding ports for<br>
components to be mixed are located in a center region of an upper plate of the<br>
housing, and a slurry outlet port for delivering mixture (slurry) from the mixer<br>
is provided in a periphery of the housing.   A rotary shaft is connected to the<br>
disc to rotate the disc.   The upper plate of the housing is provided with a<br>
plurality of upper pins (stationary pins) depending therefrom to the vicinity of<br>
the disc.   The disc is provided with lower pins (movable pins) which are<br>
1<br><br>
vertically fixed on the disc and which extend to the vicinity of the upper plate.<br>
The upper and lower pins are arranged in radially alternate positions.   The<br>
components to be mixed are supplied on the disc through the respective<br>
feeding ports, and are agitated and mixed while being moved radially outward<br>
on the disc under an action of centrifugal force, and then, delivered out of the<br>
slurry outlet port.   The mixer with this arrangement is called a pin type of<br>
mixer, which is disclosed in, e.g., US Patent Publication No. 3,459,620.<br>
In general, foam is fed into the mixer for regulating the specific gravity<br>
of gypsum board.   The importance has been attached to proper mixing of the<br>
foam in the slurry, especially in a method of producing lightweight gypsum<br>
boards.   The following publications are exemplified as prior art intended to<br>
achieve effective mixing of foam into slurry:<br>
(1)	Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-25342 (Mixer and<br>
Mixing Method)<br>
(2)	Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 11-501002 (Method for<br>
Preparing Foamed Gypsum Product)<br>
(3)	U.S. Patent Publication No. 6,494,609 (Slurry Mixer Outlet)<br>
Further, a relatively large stiff solidified gypsum (residuum) may be fed<br>
to the gypsum board liner paper from the mixer.   The following publication is<br>
exemplified as prior art which is intended to prevent a continuous operation of<br>
gypsum board producing apparatus from being unexpectedly interrupted owing<br>
to this situation:<br>
(4)	Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-6137 (Mixer and<br>
Method of Producing Gypsum Boards with the Mixer)<br>
(1) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-25342 discloses a<br>
mixer and mixing method, wherein quantities of gypsum slurry, which<br>
considerably differ in the specific gravity, can be respectively fed to a gypsum<br>
board liner paper and so forth by a single mixer.   The mixer disclosed in JP 8-<br>
25342 comprises a partition wall depending from a periphery of a housing<br>
upper plate down to a level close to a rotary disc, in such a way that the inside<br>
area of the mixer is divided into two areas (an inward area and a peripheral<br>
zone) by the partition wall.   In the peripheral zone of the upper plate, there is<br>
disposed a foam feeding part, which feeds foam for regulating the volume of<br>
slurry for a core of gypsum board (slurry with a low specific gravity).   A<br>
plurality of slurry fractionation ports are disposed on an annular wall of the<br>
housing or the peripheral zone of a housing lower plate, upstream of the foam<br>
2<br><br>
feeding part as seen in the direction of rotation.   Further, a slurry outlet port is<br>
disposed on the annular wall or the peripheral zone of the lower plate,<br>
downstream of the foam feeding part in the direction of rotation.   The<br>
fractionation ports and the slurry outlet port can respectively discharge<br>
quantities of slurry which differ in the content of foam from each other, and<br>
therefore, the quantities of slurry differing in their specific gravity can be<br>
supplied to predetermined portions of the gypsum board producing apparatus,<br>
respectively.   JP 8-25342 also discloses an arrangement in that a second foam<br>
feeding section (feeding conduit) is positioned on an upper end portion of a<br>
slurry delivery conduit.   The slurry delivery conduit is connected with the<br>
slurry outlet port by means of a hollow connector section, and it is also called<br>
as "vertical chute" or "canister".   The slurry in the slurry delivery conduit<br>
(slurry for the core) is fed with the foam.   With such an arrangement,<br>
quantities of slurry differing in their specific gravity can be prepared more<br>
efficiently by a single mixer, and the consumption of foaming agent can be<br>
reduced.<br>
In accordance with this arrangement of the mixer, it would be possible to<br>
supply the gypsum board liner paper with high-quality slurry uniformly mixed<br>
with foam, so far as the speed of production (the production rate) of gypsum<br>
boards is restricted to be at a relatively low speed so as not to increase the flow<br>
rate of slurry.   However, it has been found that, as speeding-up of production<br>
of gypsum boards is made and the flow rate of slurry is increased, a<br>
phenomenon occurs in which the foam and the slurry are not uniformly mixed.<br>
That is, if speeding up of production of gypsum boards is made, a desirable<br>
mixing condition of the slurry and the foam can not be ensured by the mixer<br>
disclosed in JP 8-25342.   For instance, phenomenon such as gas pocket of a<br>
relatively large size confined to an interface between the gypsum board core<br>
and the liner paper covering the core is apt to occur (this defectiveness is<br>
known as "bulging").   This is considered to result from separation of slurry<br>
and the foam, which is caused in the slurry delivery conduit by effects of the<br>
vortex therein, centrifugal force and differing of specific gravity, as described<br>
in U.S.P. No. 6,494,609.<br>
(2) In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 11-501002, an<br>
arrangement of mixer is disclosed, in which an insertion point of aqueous foam<br>
for regulating slurry volume is properly positioned so as to minimize<br>
destruction of foam during mixing.   In this mixer, the point of insertion is<br>
located, for instance, on an upper plate or an annular peripheral wall in<br>
position closer to a slurry discharge outlet than the location of an inlet for<br>
3<br><br>
calcined gypsum, or located on a slurry discharge conduit connected to the<br>
slurry discharge outlet.   Further, the mixer in the JP11-501002 fractionates<br>
the slurry for the edge from an outlet different from the slurry discharge outlet,<br>
similarly to the mixer disclosed in JP 8-25342 as set forth above, so that the<br>
foam for regulating the slurry volume can be fed only to the slurry for core.<br>
However, the mixer in JP 11-501002 does not have a structure<br>
corresponding to the slurry delivery conduit, and the slurry for core is directly<br>
discharged to the gypsum board liner paper through the discharge conduit.<br>
That is, the mixer in JP 11-501002 is so arranged as to immediately discharge<br>
the slurry in the mixer to the gypsum board liner paper through the discharge<br>
conduit attached to the annular wall of the mixer.   For this reason, the foam<br>
fed from the foam feeding port on the discharge conduit or its vicinity can not<br>
be sufficiently mixed nor dispersed in the slurry when the flow rate of slurry is<br>
increased.   Therefore, the mixer of this arrangement can run into difficulties<br>
when being applied to the speeding up of production rate of gypsum boards.<br>
(3) A centrifugal mixer disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No.<br>
6,494,609 is provided with an outlet in a tangential direction on an annular<br>
wall.   An elongated slurry conduit, which is in communication with the outlet<br>
opening to an inner area of the mixer, is connected with the mixer.   The<br>
conduit has a discharge spout for discharging the slurry to a gypsum board<br>
forming area.   The conduit is provided with a restrictor for creating back<br>
pressure so that a slurry rilling condition is kept in the mixer by the back<br>
pressure.   A reducer is provided at the discharge spout of the conduit, so that<br>
a slurry discharge pressure is reduced.   According to such an arrangement of<br>
the mixer, the slurry in the conduit flows in a generally streamline state in the<br>
slurry delivery route between the slurry outlet and the discharge spout.   The<br>
mixer disclosed in U.S.P. 6,494,609 is intended to provide a mixer for gypsum<br>
slurry which does not require use of a canister, taking into account the<br>
following points:<br>
®   In a conventional mixer with canister (corresponding to the<br>
aforementioned "slurry delivery conduit" ), a vortex is caused in the canister,<br>
so that an empty air space is created in the canister;<br>
® Since such an air space is formed, solidified gypsum (residuum) is<br>
produced in the canister, and this results in clogging of the slurry supply<br>
passage;<br>
(D With formation of vortex flow and generation of centrifugal force in<br>
the canister, the slurry is pushed against an inner wall surface of the canister.<br>
However, the foam tends to stay in a center area of the canister.   Therefore, a<br>
4<br><br>
portion of slurry having a high density unfavorably separates from the foam<br>
with a relatively low density (It follows that the canister takes a<br>
disadvantageous action from an aspect of uniform mixing of the slurry and the<br>
foam.)<br>
In the mixer as disclosed in U.S.P. 6,494,609, the slurry is conditioned in<br>
a streamline flow state in the slurry conduit, and the foam is mixed into the<br>
slurry in such a condition.   Therefore, the foam and the slurry might be able<br>
to be uniformly mixed.   From this point of view, the mixer of U.S.P.<br>
6,494,609 might be applicable to speeding up of gypsum board production.<br>
However, an unstable mixing condition of the foam and the slurry may be<br>
caused also in this arrangement of the mixer, when a production rate of<br>
gypsum boards is raised and the flow rate of slurry in the slurry conduit is<br>
increased.   Further, as the elongated conduit is used for streamline flow of the<br>
slurry, the slurry tends to be adhered to the conduit and a solidified gypsum<br>
(residuum) is apt to be produced in the conduit.   The growing solid gypsum<br>
(residuum) is finally discharged on the gypsum board liner paper together with<br>
the slurry.    Such a solidified gypsum (residuum) results in a problem of<br>
shearing of gypsum board liner paper, which may cause downtime of gypsum<br>
board producing process.   Therefore, this is an obstacle to continuous<br>
operation of the gypsum board producing apparatus.   Accordingly, it is<br>
necessary for an operator to squeeze the conduit and/or the spout periodically,<br>
such as every 15 minutes, in order to prevent adhesion of slurry or growth of<br>
the solid gypsum in the conduit, as described in U.S.P. 6,494,609.<br>
(4) As regards an enlarged and stiff residuum of slurry which may cause<br>
a problem of shearing the liner paper, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication<br>
No. 2000-6137 discloses an arrangement in that such a residuum is restricted<br>
in being discharged from the mixer, whereby interruption of continuous<br>
operation of the gypsum board producing apparatus is avoidable and gypsum<br>
boards can be stably produced.   An attachment having openings for screening<br>
is located at a slurry outlet port of the mixer.   The openings effect filtering of<br>
a stiff residuum which has a larger size than the size of opening, and prevent<br>
such a residuum from being discharged on the gypsum board liner paper.   In<br>
this mixer, feeding conduits for powder materials, liquid (water) and foam are<br>
connected to an upper plate of the mixer in its inward area, so that the foam<br>
introduced into the mixer is fully agitated and mixed with the slurry within the<br>
mixer.<br>
The mixer as described in JP 2000-6137 comprises the foam feeding port<br>
5<br><br>
located on the upper plate in the inward area of the mixer, and therefore, the<br>
foam of the slurry is subjected to sufficient agitating action of the mixer so that<br>
uniform mixing of the foam and the slurry is obtained.   However, this<br>
arrangement results in destruction of a relatively large quantity of foam<br>
subjected to a strong agitating action, and therefore, the quantity of foaming<br>
agent has to be increased, in correspondence with the amount of broken foam.<br>
Accordingly, the consumption of foaming agent is increased.   As the<br>
production rate of gypsum boards is increased, this tendency becomes<br>
remarkable, and therefore, this is disadvantageous in cost saving of production.<br>
Thus, when an attempt is made for speeding up of the gypsum board<br>
production line, the conventional mixer encounters at least one of the problems<br>
in uniform mixing of foam, stable supply of slurry in a high flow rate, and<br>
consumption of foaming agent.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a mixer and a mixing<br>
method for producing gypsum boards which are adaptable to speeding up in<br>
the continuous slurry pouring and casting type of gypsum board production<br>
line, which enable stable supply of a high flow rate of slurry uniformly mixed<br>
with the foam, and which enable reduction in the consumption of foam to be<br>
fed to the slurry.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a continuous<br>
slurry pouring and casting type of method for producing gypsum boards, which<br>
enables reduction in the consumption of foaming agent and speeding up of<br>
production, thereby improving productivity.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a mixer comprising a flattened and<br>
circular housing provided with an annular wall on its periphery;<br>
a rotary disc located in the housing to rotate in a predetermined<br>
rotational direction;<br>
a slurry outlet port opening on said annular wall to discharge from the<br>
housing, gypsum slurry mixed in the housing;<br>
a hollow connector section with an open end connected to said slurry<br>
outlet port and another open end connected to a substantially vertical and<br>
cylindrical slurry delivery conduit; and<br>
a foam feeding port for feeding foam to the gypsum slurry,<br>
6<br><br>
wherein said foam feeding port is provided on the annular wall on an<br>
upstream side of the slurry outlet port in the rotational direction so as to feed<br>
the foam to the gypsum slurry immediately before the gypsum slurry enters the<br>
slurry outlet port, or provided on said hollow connector section so as to feed<br>
the foam to the gypsum slurry flowing in the hollow connector section.<br>
Besides the factor of the quantity of water, the specific gravity of slurry<br>
primarily depends on the quantity of foam mixed in slurry.   As a precondition<br>
for stabilizing the specific gravity, it is necessary to uniformly mix the foam<br>
into the slurry.   According to the present invention, the foam feeding port<br>
opens on the annular wall on the side of the slurry outlet port upstream in the<br>
rotational direction of the rotary disc of the mixer (direction opposite to the<br>
rotational direction), or opens on the hollow connector section.   The foam<br>
feeding port feeds the foam from the wall surface of the annular wall to the<br>
slurry immediately before the opening of the slurry outlet port, or feeds the<br>
foam to the slurry in the hollow connector portion.    Conventionally, the foam<br>
has been fed from the upper face (upper plate) of the mixer.   In the present<br>
invention, however, the foam is fed from the circumferential wall or the hollow<br>
connector section of the mixer to be mixed with the slurry, and the foam is<br>
further mixed with the slurry in the slurry delivery conduit located downstream,<br>
whereby the foam can be uniformly mixed with the slurry in a condition of an<br>
increased flow rate of the slurry.   In addition, the foam is substantially<br>
unaffected by impact of agitation of the mixer, so that a quantity of loss of the<br>
foam is decreased, and therefore, the consumption of foaming agent can be<br>
considerably reduced.   Thus, the mixer can continuously supply the slurry<br>
uniformly mixed with the foam to a predetermined area, section, equipment<br>
and so forth in the gypsum board producing apparatus, even if the flow rate of<br>
slurry is increased owing to speeding up of the gypsum board production rate.<br>
Such a mixer can uniformly mix the slurry with the foam even in a condition<br>
of an increased flow rate of slurry equal to or higher than 1 m3/minute.<br>
Preferably, an inside area of the slurry delivery conduit has a circular<br>
transverse cross-section, and the hollow connector section is connected to a<br>
position of the slurry delivery conduit eccentric to a center axis of the inside<br>
area, so that the gypsum slurry swirls in the inside area.   According to such an<br>
arrangement, the foam is mixed in the slurry in a condition substantially<br>
unaffected by defoaming effect due to impact of agitation in the mixer, and the<br>
slurry and the foam are straightened when flowing in the hollow connector<br>
section, and then, they flow into the slurry delivery conduit.   Owing to the<br>
eccentric connection of the hollow connector section, a turning flow or<br>
7<br><br>
swirling flow of the slurry and the foam is caused in the slurry delivery conduit.<br>
The slurry and the foam swirl while gravitationally flowing down in the slurry<br>
delivery conduit.   Separation of the slurry and the foam due to difference of<br>
the specific gravity is restricted, and conversely, the slurry and the foam are<br>
uniformly mixed with each other by swirling.   Preferably, the hollow<br>
connector section causes the slurry to flow into the inside area in its tangential<br>
direction, so that the slurry in the inside area swirls in the same direction as the<br>
rotational direction of the disc or the direction opposite thereto.   It is desired<br>
that the rotational direction of the slurry in the inside area is opposite to the<br>
rotational direction of the disc.   Normally, the slurry delivery conduit is<br>
designed to deposit the gypsum slurry on the gypsum board liner paper (lower<br>
sheet of paper) conveyed along the gypsum board production line, and it<br>
continuously discharges the slurry on the lower sheet.   If desired, a spiral<br>
guide plate or a restriction is provided within the slurry delivery conduit.<br>
Preferably, the hollow connector section allows the gypsum slurry to<br>
flow into the hollow connector section in a tangential direction of the annular<br>
wall.<br>
More preferably, the hollow connector section has wall surfaces (47a,<br>
47b) on the sides upstream and downstream in the rotational direction, these<br>
wall surfaces forming a slurry passage in the section.   The wall surface (47a)<br>
on the upstream side is oriented at an angle ranging from 90° to 120° with<br>
respect to a normal line (G) of the housing.   If desired, the wall surfaces (47a,<br>
47b) on the upstream and downstream sides are located in parallel.   More<br>
preferably, the wall surface (47b) on the downstream side is positioned at a<br>
sharp angle relative to a circumferential inside surface of the annular wall so as<br>
to prevent the gypsum slurry in the slurry passage from flowing backward or<br>
returning to the peripheral zone (slurry drifting zone) of the mixing area.<br>
In another preferable arrangement, the foam feeding port is positioned in<br>
close proximity to the slurry outlet port so as to feed the foam to the slurry<br>
immediately before the slurry enters the slurry outlet port.   As a kind of<br>
mixing means, a plurality of blades are provided, which impose shearing force<br>
on the slurry flowing through the slurry outlet port.   The blades form a<br>
plurality of slits in the slurry outlet port.   Preferably, the horizontal or vertical<br>
blades having a thickness (t) ranging from 1 mm to 5 mm are arranged at equal<br>
intervals to form slits, and a fluid passage dimension (h, w) of the slit between<br>
the blades is set to be in a range from 4 mm to 15 mm.   The ingredients fed to<br>
the mixing area moves outward on the rotary disc under centrifugal force while<br>
8<br><br>
being agitated and mixed, and the slurry reaches the peripheral zone of the<br>
mixing area under a condition whereby the mixing is substantially completed.<br>
The foam fed from the foam feeding port to the slurry in the mixer is subjected<br>
to the centrifugal force of the mixer to pass through the slits together with the<br>
slurry.   That is, the foam is fed to the slurry in the peripheral zone at the final<br>
stage of preparation of the slurry, and the slurry and the foam undergo strong<br>
shearing force so as to be mixed during passing through the slit.   As the result<br>
of mixing of the slurry and the foam in the slurry outlet port, separation of<br>
slurry and the foam due to difference of the specific gravity is restricted, and<br>
mixing of the slurry and the foam is rather promoted in the slurry delivery<br>
conduit.   The dimensions and configuration of the slurry outlet port are<br>
usually designed in such a way that it is a rectangle of 100^500 mm in width<br>
and 50~ 100mm in height.   However, the number and configuration of the<br>
slurry outlet port can be appropriately designed.   For instance, a plurality of<br>
slurry outlet ports may be provided on the annular wall.   Similarly, the<br>
number and configuration of foam feeding port may be appropriately designed.<br>
For instance, a plurality of foam feeding ports may be provided on the annular<br>
wall.<br>
If desired, an attachment provided with the blades (vanes) and the slits,<br>
or an attachment integrally assembled with the blades, the slits and the foam<br>
feeding port can be detachably mounted on the annular wall.   Desirably, an<br>
attachment integrally assembled with the slurry outlet port, the hollow<br>
connector section and the slurry delivery conduit is previously furnished, and<br>
the attachment is detachably mounted on the annular wall.   In use of such an<br>
attachment, the attachment can be removed or replaced during maintenance<br>
such as cleaning of the slurry outlet port or replacement thereof.   When the<br>
attachment should be replaced with another attachment of different design,<br>
involving a change of manufacture condition, change of specification of<br>
gypsum board or the like, it is possible to readily mount a replaceable<br>
attachment of different design on the mixer.   This attachment may differ in<br>
dimension or configuration of the slurry outlet port, position of the foam<br>
feeding port, existence thereof, and so forth.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of mixing gypsum slurry<br>
utilizing a mixer for gypsum slurry, the mixer comprising a flattened and<br>
circular housing provided with an annular wall on its periphery; a rotary disc<br>
located in the housing and rotated in a predetermined rotational direction; a<br>
slurry outlet port opening on said annular wall for discharging from the<br>
housing, gypsum slurry mixed in the housing; a hollow connector section with<br>
9<br><br>
an open end connected to said slurry outlet port and another open end<br>
connected to a substantially vertical and cylindrical slurry delivery conduit;<br>
and a foam feeding port for feeding foam to the gypsum slurry, comprising:<br>
a first mixing step of mixing powder material and water, which are fed<br>
into said housing, in a mixing area within said housing with rotation of said<br>
disc to prepare the slurry, and causing said slurry to flow through said slurry<br>
outlet port to the hollow connector section; and<br>
a second mixing step of feeding the foam to the gypsum slurry from the<br>
foam feeding port, which is located on the annular wall on an upstream side of<br>
the slurry outlet port in the rotational direction so as to feed the foam to the<br>
gypsum slurry immediately before the gypsum slurry enters the slurry outlet<br>
port, or which is located in the hollow connector section so as to feed the foam<br>
to the gypsum slurry in the hollow connector section, and imposing shearing<br>
force on the slurry and the foam at said slurry outlet port or on its downstream<br>
side so as to mix the slurry and the foam.<br>
The mixing method of the present invention comprises a step for slurry<br>
preparation in the mixing area (the first mixing step) and a step for feeding and<br>
mixing of the foam to the slurry (the second mixing step).   The foam is fed to<br>
the slurry in a route of slurry from the peripheral zone via the slurry outlet port<br>
to the slurry delivery conduit, and the slurry is subjected to shearing force so<br>
that it is to be mixed with the foam, immediately after supply of the foam.<br>
The foam is mixed into the slurry without influence of defoaming effect due to<br>
agitation impact of the mixer, and mixed with the slurry at the slurry outlet<br>
port or downstream thereof.   Therefore, the required consumption of foaming<br>
agent can be considerably reduced.   Further, the foam is uniformly mixed<br>
with the slurry in the second mixing step, and therefore, the flow rate of slurry<br>
can be increased.<br>
Preferably, the foam is fed to the slurry immediately before or<br>
immediately after the slurry flows through the slurry outlet port.   The fluid of<br>
the slurry and the foam eccentric to the inside area of the slurry delivery<br>
conduit having a circular transverse cross-section flows into the inside area in a<br>
tangential direction thereof, so that the slurry and the foam swirl in the inside<br>
area.   The slurry and the foam are mixed with each other by shearing force<br>
acting on the slurry during swirling.<br>
As another preferable arrangement, a plurality of blades forming a<br>
plurality of slits are disposed in the slurry outlet port, and the foam is fed to the<br>
slurry immediately before the slurry passes through the slits so that the slurry<br>
10<br><br>
and the foam are mixed with each other by shearing force acting on the slurry<br>
passing through the slits.<br>
These mixing steps may be simultaneously employed.   In such a case,<br>
the slurry and the foam are mixed by shearing force acting on the slurry<br>
passing through the slits, and further mixed by shearing force acting on the<br>
slurry during swirling.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing gypsum boards<br>
with use of the mixer as set forth above, wherein gypsum boards having a<br>
thickness of 9.5 mm and a width of 910 mm (JIS A6901) are produced at a<br>
production rate equal to or higher than 110 m/minute.   This speed of<br>
production approximately corresponds to a production rate equal to or higher<br>
than 85 m/minute, with respect to gypsum boards which have a thickness of<br>
12.5 mm and a width of 910 mm (JIS A6901).<br>
The present invention also provides a method of producing gypsum<br>
boards with use of the mixer as set forth above, wherein the gypsum slurry at a<br>
flow rate equal to or higher than 1 m3/minute is fed between the sheets of<br>
gypsum board liner paper passing through forming means.<br>
According to the present method of producing gypsum boards,<br>
productivity of lightweight gypsum boards is considerably improved, and<br>
therefore, significant and useful effects can be obtained particularly in<br>
production of lightweight gypsum boards.<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the attached drawings, preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention are described hereinafter.<br>
FIG. 1 is an explanatory view partially and schematically illustrating a<br>
forming process of gypsum boards.<br>
A lower sheet of paper 1 for a gypsum board liner is conveyed along a<br>
line of production.   A mixer 10 is located in a predetermined position in<br>
relation to a conveyance line, e.g., in a position above the conveyance line.<br>
Powder materials (calcined gypsum, adhesive agent, set accelerator, additives,<br>
admixture and so forth), foam and liquid (water) are fed to the mixer 10.   The<br>
mixer 10 mixes these materials and discharges slurry (calcined gypsum slurry)<br>
3 onto the sheet 1 by means of conduits 12 (12a, 12b), 14.   The conduit 14 is<br>
positioned so as to discharge the slurry 3 on a widthwise center area of the<br>
sheet 1.   The conduits 12a, 12b are positioned so as to discharge the slurry 3<br>
on widthwise end portions (edge zones) of the sheet 1 respectively.<br>
The sheet 1 is transferred together with the slurry 3 to reach a pair of<br>
forming rollers 18,18.   An upper sheet of paper 2 travels partially around a<br>
peripheral surface of the upper roller 18 to be diverted toward a conveyance<br>
direction.   The diverted upper sheet 2 is brought into contact with the slurry 3<br>
on the lower sheet 1 and transferred in the conveyance direction substantially<br>
in parallel with the lower sheet 1.   A continuous three-layered formation<br>
constituted by the sheets 1,2 and the slurry 3 is formed on a downstream side<br>
of the rollers 18,18.   This formation runs continuously at a conveyance<br>
velocity V while setting the slurry 3, and it reaches cutting rollers 19,19.   A<br>
variety of forming ways with use of alternative means, instead of the forming<br>
rollers 18,18, may be employed, e.g., a forming way with use of an extruder,<br>
or a forming way of causing the formation to pass through a gate with a<br>
rectangular opening.<br>
13<br><br>
The cutting rollers 19,19 sever the continuous formation into boards of a<br>
predetermined length, so as to make boards having a gypsum core covered<br>
with gypsum board liner papers, i.e., green boards.   Then, the parts of<br>
formation thus severed (green boards) are charged into a dryer for forced<br>
drying therein, and thereafter, they are cut to a predetermined product length.<br>
Thus, gypsum board products are successively produced.<br>
In FIGS. 2 to 6, there is shown the mixer of a first embodiment<br>
according to the present invention.   FIGS. 2 and 3 are a plan view and a<br>
perspective view generally showing the mixer 10, and FIGS. 4,5 and 6 are a<br>
transverse cross-sectional view, a vertical cross-sectional view and a<br>
fragmentary sectional perspective view which show an internal structure of the<br>
mixer 10.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the mixer 10 has a flattened cylindrical<br>
housing or casing 20 (referred to as "housing 20" hereinafter).   The housing<br>
20 has a horizontal and round upper plate or top cover 21 (referred to as "upper<br>
plate 21" hereinafter), a horizontal and round lower plate or bottom cover 22<br>
(referred to as "lower plate 22" hereinafter), and an annular wall or outer<br>
peripheral wall 23 (referred to as " annular wall 23" hereinafter) which is<br>
positioned in peripheral positions of the upper and lower plates 21, 22.   The<br>
plates 21,22 are positioned, vertically spaced apart at a predetermined distance,<br>
so that a mixing area for mixing the power materials and liquid (water) is<br>
defined in the mixer 10.   A circular opening 25 is formed at a center part of<br>
the upper plate 21.   An enlarged lower portion 31 of a rotatable vertical shaft<br>
30 extends through the opening 25.   The shaft 30 is connected with rotary<br>
drive means, such as an electric drive motor (not shown), and driven in<br>
rotation in a predetermined rotational direction (clockwise direction R as seen<br>
from its upper side, in this embodiment).   If desired, a variable speed device,<br>
such as a variable speed gear mechanism or belt assembly, may be interposed<br>
between the shaft 30 and an output shaft of the rotary drive means.<br>
A powder supply conduit 15 for feeding the powder materials to be<br>
mixed is connected to the upper plate 21.   A water supply conduit 16 for<br>
supplying a quantity of mixing water is also connected to the upper plate 21.<br>
If desired, an internal pressure regulator (not shown) for limiting excessive<br>
increase of internal pressure and so forth may be further connected to the upper<br>
plate 21.<br>
A foam feeding conduit 40 is connected to the annular wall 23.   A foam<br>
feeding port 41 of the conduit 40 opens on a circumferential inside surface of<br>
14<br><br>
the annular wall 23.   A quantity of foam for regulating the volume of slurry is<br>
supplied to the constituents of mixture in the mixer 10 by the conduit 40.   A<br>
slurry outlet port 45 is formed on the annular wall 23.   The port 45 is<br>
positioned on a downstream side of the port 41 in the rotational direction.<br>
The port 45 opens on the circumferential inside surface of the annular wall 23<br>
in close proximity to the port 41.<br>
An enlarged open end of a hollow connector section 47 is connected<br>
with an edge of opening of the slurry outlet port 45.   The section 47 extends<br>
outward from the annular wall 23.   A reduced open end of the section 47 is<br>
connected with an upper end portion of the slurry delivery conduit 46.<br>
On an opposite side of the conduit 46, fractionation ports 48a, 48b are<br>
provided on the annular wall 23.   The conduits 12a, 12b are connected to the<br>
ports 48a, 48b, respectively.   The ports 48a, 48b are positioned, spaced at a<br>
predetermined angle a from each other.   Inlet ports of the powder supply<br>
conduit 15 and the water supply conduit 16 open within a range of the angle a<br>
in a center region of the upper plate 21, respectively.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the slurry outlet port 45 is positioned on the annular<br>
wall 23, spaced at a predetermined angle P from the fractionation port 48a in<br>
the rotational direction R.   The foam feeding conduit 40 is connected to the<br>
annular wall 23 within a range of the angle p.   The foam feeding port 41 is<br>
positioned on an upstream side of the port 45 in close proximity thereto.   The<br>
conduit 40 feeds a predetermined quantity of foam to the slurry which is about<br>
to flow out through the port 45, immediately before it flows therethrough.<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic plan view which geometrically illustrates an<br>
arrangement of the annular wall 23, the slurry delivery conduit 46 and the<br>
hollow connector section 47.   In FIG. 7, normal lines G, K extending from a<br>
center axis 10b of the disc 32 are shown by hypothetical lines.<br>
The hollow connector section 47 is constructed from a vertical side wall<br>
47a on the upstream side, a vertical side wall 47b on the downstream side, a<br>
horizontal top wall 47c (FIG. 3) and a horizontal bottom wall 47d.   The<br>
vertical side wall 47a is inclined at a predetermined angle 84 with respect to the<br>
normal line G of the mixer 10.   The hollow connector section 47 diverges<br>
toward a mixing area 10a of the mixer 10 in accordance with the inclination of<br>
the wall 47a.   The section 47 receives the slurry of the mixing area 10a<br>
generally in a tangential direction, and conducts the slurry to the slurry<br>
delivery conduit 46.<br>
15<br><br>
An edge portion of the port 45 on the upstream side in the rotational<br>
direction (a vertical side wall 53) continues to the wall 47a, and an edge<br>
portion of the port 45 on the downstream side in the rotational direction (a<br>
vertical side wall 54) continues to the wall 47b.   The wall 53 is oriented<br>
approximately in a tangential direction of the annular wall 23, and the walls 54,<br>
47b are oriented approximately in a diametrical direction.   An extension line<br>
of the wall 47a and the normal line G intersect at an intersection F, and an<br>
angle 64 (=180° -y+B2 —0a ) at the intersection F is set to be in a range of<br>
90° ~180° .   Preferably, the angle 64   is set to be in a range of 90° ~~<br>
105° .   The angle 04   can be desirably set to be 90°    (a right angle) .   In<br>
such a case, the wall 47a extends in a tangential direction from the annular<br>
wall 23.<br>
An angle 0Z between a center of the foam feeding port 41 and an inner<br>
end J of the wall 53 is set to be in a range of 0° ^90° .   The angle 02 is set<br>
to be preferably in a range of 0° ^30° , and more preferably in a range of<br>
0° ~15° , so that the port 41 is in close proximity to the wall 53.   The foam<br>
feeding conduit 40 is connected with the annular wall 23 at an angle 03  with<br>
respect to the normal line K.   The angle 03 is set to be in a range of 0° ^<br>
90° , and preferably in a range of 0° ~60° , and more preferably in a range<br>
of0° ^30° .   If desired, the conduit 40 can be connected with the wall 23 at<br>
the angle 03   ranging from, e.g., -30° to0° so that the port 41 is directed<br>
against the fluid in a rotational direction R, so far as the object of the present<br>
invention can be achieved.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4 to 6, a rotary disc 32 is rotatably located in the<br>
housing 20.   A lower face of the enlarged lower portion 31 of the rotary shaft<br>
30 is fixedly secured to a center part of the disc 32.   The center axis 10b of<br>
the disc 32 coincides with an axis of rotation of the shaft 30.   The disc 32 is<br>
rotated with rotation of the shaft 30 in a direction as indicated by the arrow R<br>
(clockwise direction).<br>
The inside area 10a of the housing 20 can be divided into an inward zone<br>
and a peripheral zone by a hypothetical boundary 26.    If desired, an annular<br>
partition wall 26' depending from a lower surface of the upper plate 21 as<br>
illustrated by hypothetical lines on FIGS. 5 and 6 can be provided in the<br>
housing 20 along the boundary 26.   In such a case, the wall 26' is located in<br>
position substantially concentric with the annular wall 23, so that the inside<br>
area 10a is definitely divided into the peripheral zone close to a wear-resistant<br>
ring 23a and the inward zone located radially inward of the housing 20.   The<br>
16<br><br>
wear-resistant ring 23a is fixed to the inside surface of the annular wall 23.<br>
A number of lower pins (movable pins) 38 are arranged on the rotary<br>
disc 32 in a plurality of rows extending generally in a radial direction.   The<br>
lower pins 38 are vertically mounted on the upper surface of the disc 32 in the<br>
inward zone.   The disc 32 is formed with a number of gear configurations 37<br>
in the peripheral zone.   The tooth configurations 37 act to displace or energize<br>
the mixed fluid (slurry) in an outward and rotational direction.   A plurality of<br>
pins 36 are vertically fixed also on the tooth configurations 37.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, a number of upper pins (stationary pins) 28<br>
are fixed to the upper plate 21 to depend therefrom in the inside area 10a.<br>
The upper pins 28 and the lower pins 38 are alternately arranged in the radial<br>
direction of the disc 32 so that the pins 28, 38 make relative motion for mixing<br>
the materials of gypsum board when the disc rotates.   Although the pins 28,<br>
36,38 with a round cross-section are illustrated in FIGS. 4 to 6, the pin 28,36,<br>
38 may have a polygonal or elliptical cross-section as disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-262882.<br>
FIGS. 8 to 10 shows a second embodiment of the mixer according to the<br>
present invention.    FIG. 8 is a transverse cross-sectional view and a partially<br>
enlarged cross-sectional view showing an internal structure of the mixer 10,<br>
and FIG. 9 is a schematic plan view which geometrically illustrates an<br>
arrangement of the annular wall 23, the slurry delivery conduit 46 and the<br>
hollow connector section 47.   FIG. 10(A) is a partial perspective view<br>
showing a structure of the slurry outlet port 45 and FIG. 10(B) is an enlarged<br>
vertical cross-sectional view showing a structure of slit in the port 45.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 8 and 10, an attachment 50 is detachably installed on<br>
an enlarged open end of the slurry outlet port 45.   The attachment 50 is<br>
provided with a plurality of horizontal guide members 51.    Conventional<br>
means for installation may be employed for installation of the attachment 50,<br>
such as fitting structure; adhesion; welding; or otherwise, fixing, cramping or<br>
securing by cramping tool or securing tool (cramp, bolt or the like).<br>
The enlarged open end (width W, height H) of the hollow connector<br>
section 47 is jointed to the annular wall 23, and the reduced open end thereof is<br>
jointed to the slurry delivery conduit 46.   The side walls 47a, 47b, top wall<br>
47c and bottom wall 47d of the hollow connector section 47 constitute a slurry<br>
passage between the slurry outlet port 45 and the slurry delivery conduit 46,<br>
wherein a rectangular cross-section of the passage is reduced toward the<br>
conduit 46.<br>
17<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 10(A), the horizontal guide members 51 extend<br>
throughout the width of the port 45.   The ends of each of the guide members<br>
51 are fixed to right and left vertical frames of the attachment 50 (the vertical<br>
side walls 53,54).   The guide members 51 are arranged at regular intervals<br>
(interval P).<br>
As shown in FIG. 10(B), the guide member 51 is a web plate made of<br>
metal or resin, which has a rectangular cross-section.   The cross-sectional<br>
dimension of the guide member 51 is set to have thickness t= l~5mm and<br>
depth D=5^50mm (preferably, D=10~20mm).   The guide members 51<br>
forms a plurality of horizontal blades circumferentially extending in the slurry<br>
outlet port 45.   Horizontal slits 52 are defined between the guide members 51<br>
as slurry passages, each having the height h (h=P —t), width w (w=W—<br>
width of the vertical frame of attachment) and depth d (d=D).    The height h<br>
is set to be in a range of 4^ 15mm.<br>
The slurry outlet port 45 is divided into the slits 52 by the guide<br>
members 51.   The mixing area 10a of the mixer 10 is in communication with<br>
a slurry passage 47e within the hollow connector section 47 by means of the<br>
slits 52.<br>
Preferably, a plurality of grooves (not shown), into which the ends of the<br>
guide members 51 can be fit* are regularly arranged in the left and right<br>
vertical frames (vertical side walls 53,54), vertically at predetermined<br>
intervals.   Such an attachment 50 enables optimization of the dimension of<br>
the slit by changing the guide member 51 and the attachment 50 to those of an<br>
appropriate combination or assembly, when it is necessary to change the<br>
dimension of the slit and so forth in accordance with change of operating<br>
condition, composition of slurry, or the like.   Further, such a structure of the<br>
attachment 50 enables renewal of only guide members 51 or replacement of<br>
guide members 51 with different guide members 51 of a proper configuration<br>
or material.   Alternatively, a wide variety of attachments 50 with various<br>
dimensions or configurations of the slits may be previously reserved, whereby<br>
the whole attachment 50 can be replaced with the other attachment in<br>
accordance with change of operating condition, composition of slurry, or the<br>
like.<br>
An operation of the mixer 10 is described hereinafter with respect to the<br>
first and the second embodiments.<br>
The rotary disc 32 is rotated in the direction of arrow R by operation of<br>
the rotary drive means, and ingredients (powder materials) and mixing water to<br>
18<br><br>
be mixed in the mixer 10 are fed to the mixer 10 through the powder supply<br>
conduit 15 and the water supply conduit 16.   The ingredients and water are<br>
introduced into the inward zone of the mixer 10, agitated therein and mixed<br>
with each other, while moving radially outward on the disc 32 to the peripheral<br>
zone across the boundary 26 under the action of centrifugal force.   The pins<br>
36 on the tooth configuration 37 wipe or scrape off the slurry on the<br>
circumferential inside surface of the ring 23a.<br>
The slurry produced in the mixing area 10a is displaced outward and<br>
frontward in the rotational direction by the tooth configuration 37, and the<br>
slurry flows out from the slurry outlet port 45 into the hollow connector<br>
section 47.   The slurry flows through the section 47 into the slurry delivery<br>
conduit 46.   The foam feeding port 41 of the foam feeding conduit 40 feeds a<br>
required quantity of foam to the slurry immediately before it flows out from<br>
the port 45, so that the foam mixes into the mixed ingredients in the peripheral<br>
zone.<br>
In the mixer 10 of the first embodiment (FIGS. 2 to 7), the port 41 feeds<br>
the foam from the circumferential peripheral surface to the slurry immediately<br>
before the slurry flows out through the port 45.   Even if the flow rate of slurry<br>
is increased, the foam is uniformly mixed in the slurry.   The quantity of loss<br>
of the foam is reduced, since the foam is not substantially subjected to an<br>
agitation impact of the mixer.<br>
In the mixer 10 of the second embodiment (FIGS. 8 to 10), which is<br>
provided with the guide members 51, the slurry flows into the slits 52<br>
immediately after the foam is fed to the slurry.   The slurry and the foam are<br>
subjected to a strong shearing force when flowing along the surface of the<br>
guide member 51, whereby they are mixed.<br>
The slurry mixed with the foam flows through the hollow connector<br>
section 47 into the slurry delivery conduit 46 in which the slurry is subjected to<br>
a turning force and a shearing force so as to be mixed further uniformly, and<br>
thereafter, the slurry is discharged on the widthwise center area of the lower<br>
sheet 1 through the conduit 14 (FIG. 1), wherein the slurry delivery conduit 46<br>
constitutes an external agitating area.<br>
The slurry of the peripheral zone also flows into the conduits 12a, 12b<br>
through the fractionation ports 48 disposed upstream (direction opposite to the<br>
rotation) of the foam feeding port 41 and the hollow connector section 47.<br>
The slurry through the conduits 12a, 12b is discharged on the edge zones of the<br>
lower sheet 1 (FIG. 1).   The slurry in the vicinity of the ports 48 is slurry<br>
19<br><br>
which has not reached the foam feeding port 41, i.e., slurry to which the foam<br>
has not been added.   Therefore, the slurry delivered to the edge zones through<br>
the ports 48 has a relatively high specific gravity.<br>
The mixer 10 feeds the slurry with a relatively low specific gravity<br>
through the slurry delivery conduit 46 and the conduit 14 to the center area of<br>
the lower sheet 1, and the slurry with a relatively high specific gravity through<br>
the fractionation ports 48a, 48b and the conduits 12 to the respective edge<br>
zones of the lower sheet 1.   According to such an arrangement of the mixer<br>
10, both of the slurry with high specific gravity and the slurry with low<br>
specific gravity can be prepared by the single mixer, and therefore, the<br>
quantities of slurry differing in their specific gravity can be supplied to desired<br>
parts of the gypsum board production line, respectively.   As such desired<br>
parts, equipment well-known by those skilled in the art can be exemplified,<br>
such as a roll coater for coating the gypsum board liner paper with the slurry of<br>
a high specific gravity so as to form a film thereon, or an auxiliary mixer for<br>
adding water or various additives to the slurry to be fed to the edge zones of<br>
the liner paper.   The materials for gypsum board, which are conveyed to the<br>
dryer by the gypsum board production line (FIG. 1), include the slurry with a<br>
relatively low specific gravity in the center area and the slurry with a relatively<br>
high specific gravity in the edge zones.   Such materials for gypsum board can<br>
be uniformly dried forcibly by the dryer downstream of the conveyance line.<br>
The present inventors have made comparison of the following operating<br>
conditions:<br>
(1)	an operating condition in which the foam is merely mixed into the<br>
slurry in the center region of the mixer 10 so that the specific gravity of the<br>
solidified core of gypsum board is set to be 0.65~0.70 g/cm3; and<br>
(2)	an operating condition in which the foam is mixed into the slurry<br>
through the foam feeding port 41 of the conduit 40 in accordance with the<br>
present invention so that the specific gravity of the solidified core of gypsum<br>
board is also set to be 0.65^0.70 g/cm3.<br>
The latter operating condition (the present invention), in which the foam<br>
is introduced from the port 41, has enabled the consumption of foaming agent<br>
to be reduced by approximately 35 %.<br>
FIG. 11(A) is a perspective view showing a modification of the structure<br>
of the attachment as shown in FIG. 10, and FIG. 11(B) is a partially enlarged<br>
transverse cross-sectional view showing the structure of slits in the slurry<br>
20<br><br>
outlet port 45.<br>
In the embodiment as shown in FIG. 11, the attachment 50 has a<br>
plurality of vertical guide members 51 disposed along the circumferential<br>
inside wall surface of the annular wall 23 at equal intervals (interval P).   The<br>
upper end portion of the guide member 51 is fixed to an upper frame of the<br>
attachment 50, and the lower end portion thereof is fixed to a lower frame of<br>
the attachment 50.   The guide members 51 forms a number of vertical blades,<br>
and the vertical slits 52 with the dimension of fluid passage w are defined<br>
between the blades in the slurry outlet port 45.   Each of the slits 52 makes a<br>
slurry passage with a cross-section and a length (width w, height h, depth d)<br>
corresponding to the interval P and the depth D of the guide member 51.<br>
Thus, the slurry outlet port 45 is divided into the slits 52 so that the mixing<br>
area 10a of the mixer 10 is in communication with the slurry passage 47e of<br>
the section 47 through the slits 52.<br>
FIG. 12 is a partially enlarged cross-sectional view of the attachment<br>
showing modifications of the guide member 51.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 12, the guide members 51 may be inclined in a<br>
rotational direction R for smooth effluence of the slurry (FIG. 12(A)).   The<br>
cross-section of the member 51 is not limited to a rectangular configuration,<br>
but it may be, e.g., a cross-section reducing toward the direction of slurry flow<br>
(FIGS. 12(B) and 12(D)), or a curved cross-section corresponding to the slurry<br>
flow configuration (FIG. 12(C)).   Further, the guide member 51 may be<br>
mounted on the frame of the attachment 50 pivotably about a rotary shaft 51a,<br>
as shown in FIG. 12(E).   In such a case, an inclined angle r\ of the respective<br>
guide members 51 relative to the rotational direction R or a horizontal plane<br>
can be variably set by an angle regulating mechanism (not shown).   Action of<br>
the blade on the slurry can be adjusted by adjustment of the angle r\, so that the<br>
shearing force acting on the slurry can be adjusted.<br>
FIG. 13 is a perspective view showing the attachment 50 which has a<br>
foam feeding conduit 40, the foam feeding port 41, the hollow connector<br>
section 47 and the slurry delivery conduit 46 integrally assembled.   FIG. 14 is<br>
a perspective view showing a condition of installation of the attachment 50<br>
shown in FIG. 13 on the annular wall 23 of the mixer 10.   FIG. 15 is a<br>
transverse cross-sectional view showing a structure of a body part 57 and a<br>
bracket 60 of the attachment shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, and FIG. 16 includes a<br>
front elevation, a transverse cross-section and a rear elevation showing the<br>
structure of the body part 57.<br>
21<br><br>
The attachment 50 as shown in FIGS. 13 to 16 has the body part 57 with<br>
the foam feeding port 41, slurry outlet port 45 and slits 52, and an arcuate<br>
bracket 60 for fixing the body part 57 on the annular wall 23.   As shown in<br>
FIG. 13, the body part 57 and the bracket 60 are integrally jointed together.<br>
An opening 61 conforming to the slurry outlet port 45 is formed in the bracket<br>
60.   The body part 57 is a relatively thick arcuate plate, which has a vertical<br>
side wall 53 extending at an angle 04 relative to the normal line G (FIGS. 15<br>
and 16), and a vertical side wall 54 inclined in a direction similar to that of the<br>
wall 53.   These walls 53,54, a horizontal top wall 55 and a horizontal bottom<br>
wall 56 (FIG. 16) form the slurry outlet port 45 in a center of the body portion<br>
57.   The horizontal guide members (horizontal blades) 51 are supported by<br>
the walls 53,54 and the horizontal slits 52 are formed in the port 45.   As<br>
shown in FIG. 16, bolt holes 59 are bored at end portions of the body part 57,<br>
and the part 57 is fixed to the bracket 60 by bolts 62 screwed in the holes 59<br>
through the bracket 60, as shown in FIG. 15.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, the enlarged end of the section 47 is integrally<br>
connected to the bracket 60 and the reduced end thereof is integrally connected<br>
to the upper end portion of the conduit 46.   The integrally assembled part 57,<br>
bracket 60, section 47 and conduit 46 provide the integral attachment 50,<br>
which can be fit in the opening 49 of the wall 23.<br>
The body part 57 is formed with the foam feeding port 41.   The end<br>
portion of the foam feeding conduit 40 extends through the bracket 60 to be<br>
jointed to the port 41.   The port 41 is positioned in the vicinity of the edge<br>
53aofthewall53(FIG. 15).<br>
As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the attachment 50 is installed on the<br>
opening 49 and fixed to the wall 23 by bolts 63.   Thus, the mixer 10 is<br>
provided with a series of slurry supply passages including the section 47 and<br>
the conduit 46.<br>
According to such an arrangement of the attachment 50, the mixer 10<br>
can be provided with a series of fluid passages for feeding slurry, merely by<br>
fixing the attachment 50 to the wall 23 with the bolts 63.   The series of fluid<br>
passage can be wholly removed from the mixer 10 by disengaging the bolts 63<br>
and detaching the attachment 50 from the wall 23.   Therefore, maintenance of<br>
the attachment 50, such as cleaning, repair or replacement of parts, can be<br>
readily performed, or the attachment 50 can be relatively easily replaced with<br>
other attachments of dimensions, structures or materials of other designs or<br>
specifications.<br>
22<br><br>
A third embodiment of mixer according to the present invention is<br>
shown in FIGS. 17 to 26.   FIGS. 17 and 18 are a plan view and a perspective<br>
view showing the structure of the mixer of the third embodiment, and FIGS. 19,<br>
20 and 21 are transverse and vertical cross-sectional views, a fragmentary<br>
sectional perspective view and a partially enlarged cross-sectional view, which<br>
show an internal structure of the mixer as shown in FIGS. 17 and 18.   In<br>
FIGS. 17 to 21, substantially the same constituents as those shown in FIGS. 1<br>
to 16 are indicated by the same reference numerals.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiments, the hollow connector section 47 has<br>
the structure enlarging toward the annular wall 23, but the section 47 in this<br>
embodiment has a generally equal cross-section and extends approximately in<br>
a tangential direction of the wall 23.   Further, the slurry outlet port 45 in the<br>
aforementioned embodiments is provided with the guide members 51 and the<br>
slits 52.   However, the port 45 in this embodiment does not have the guide<br>
members 51 and the slits 52, but it opens fully.<br>
An end of the section 47 is connected with the wall 23 and another end<br>
thereof is connected with conduit 46.   The vertical side wall 47a, 47b, the<br>
horizontal top wall 47c and the horizontal bottom wall 47d of the section 47<br>
defines a slurry passage 47e with an equal rectangular cross-section between<br>
the port 45 and the conduit 46.<br>
As shown in FIG. 21, an edge of the port 45 on its upstream side<br>
constitutes the vertical side wall 53 continuing to the wall 47a, and an edge of<br>
the port 45 on the downstream side constitutes the vertical side wall 54<br>
continuing to the wall 47b.   The wall 54 defines a relatively sharp vertical<br>
frame 58.   The frame 58 with a sharp angle 85 is directed toward the upstream<br>
side in the rotational direction.   The frame 58 conducts the slurry of the<br>
mixing area 10a into the port 45 and prevents the slurry in the port 45 from<br>
flowing backward or returning to the area 10a as indicated by a dotted line<br>
(FIG. 21(Q).   Such a configuration of the vertical frame 58 is important for<br>
extracting the slurry from the mixer in an approximately tangential direction of<br>
the circumferential inside wall surface of the wall 23.<br>
The vertical side walls 47a, 47b, 53,54 extend at a predetermined angle<br>
64 relative to the normal line G.   The angle 04 is set to be 90° ~180° , and<br>
preferably, 90° ~105° .   More preferably, the angle 64 is set to be 90° (a<br>
right angle), so that the wall 47a extends in a tangential direction of the wall<br>
23.   The port 45 and the section 47 open to the mixing area 10a of the mixer<br>
10 so as to receive the slurry in an approximately tangential direction of the<br>
23<br><br>
circumferential inside wall of the wall 23, and they conduct the slurry effluent<br>
to the conduit 46.<br>
FIG. 22 is a schematic plan view which illustrates a geometrical<br>
positional relation among the area 10a, the section 47 and the conduit 46.<br>
The mixing area 10a of the mixer 10 has a round transverse cross-section<br>
with a radius rl, a center of which resides on an axis 10b of the disc 32.   The<br>
inside area 46a of the conduit 46 has a round transverse cross-section with a<br>
radius r2, a center of which resides on an axis 46b.   The section 47 is<br>
connected to the conduit 46 eccentrically on one side (on the side of the wall<br>
23 in this embodiment).   Therefore, the slurry passage 47e opens to the area<br>
46a in a position eccentric on one side.<br>
The slurry effluent from the area 10a to the slurry passage 47e flows<br>
through the passage 47e along a center 47f thereof, and it enters the area 46a<br>
having a round transverse cross-section, generally in a tangential direction.<br>
Swirling or turning force acts on the slurry entering the area 46a with the<br>
eccentricity of the area 46a and the passage 47e, so that the slurry flows in<br>
rotation along a circumferential inside wall surface of the area 46a.   The<br>
swirling direction of the slurry is opposite to the rotational direction R of the<br>
disc 32, i.e., counter-clockwise direction, so that the slurry undergoes a mixing<br>
and stirring action with such a swirling motion.<br>
In FIG. 22, the passage 47e is generally connected to a half of the<br>
conduit 46 on one side, but the passage 47e may be connected to the conduit<br>
46 in such a manner that a part of the passage 47e opens to the other half of the<br>
conduit 46.<br>
The foam feeding port 41 opens on the circumferential inside wall<br>
surface of the wall 23 in close proximity to the port 45 so as to feed the foam<br>
to the slurry immediately before the slurry flows into the passage 47e.<br>
Alternatively, the port 41 may open on the wall 47a so as to feed the foam to<br>
the slurry in the passage 47e, as shown by dotted lines in FIG. 22.<br>
An operation of the mixer 10 as shown in FIGS. 17^22 is described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The rotary disc 32 is rotated in the direction of arrow R with operation of<br>
the rotary drive means, and ingredients (powder materials) and mixing water to<br>
be mixed in the mixer 10 are fed into the mixer 10 through the powder supply<br>
conduit 15 and the water supply conduit 16.   The ingredients and water are<br>
introduced into the inward area of the mixer 10, and agitated and mixed with<br>
24<br><br>
each other, while moving radially outward on the disc 32 to the peripheral zone<br>
across the boundary 26 under the action of centrifugal force.   The pins 36 on<br>
the tooth configurations 37 wipe or scrape off the slurry on the inside<br>
circumferential surface of the ring 23a.<br>
The slurry produced in the mixing area 10a is displaced outward and<br>
forward in the rotational direction by the tooth configurations 37.   The slurry<br>
flows out from the slurry outlet port 45 substantially in the tangential direction<br>
and flows through the section 47 into the conduit 46.   The foam feeding<br>
conduit 40 feeds a required quantity of foam to the slurry immediately before it<br>
flows through the port 45, so that the foam mixes in the slurry in the peripheral<br>
zone.   The slurry flows in the tangential direction through the port 45 into the<br>
section 47 immediately after the slurry is fed with the foam.   The slurry and<br>
the foam are straightened in the passage 47e which has a substantially equal<br>
cross-section, so that they enter the area 46a of the conduit 46 through the<br>
passage 47e as a streamline slurry flow.   In a case where the foam feeding<br>
port 41 is positioned on the wall 47a, the foam mixes in the slurry entering the<br>
port 45, and immediately thereafter, it enters the conduit 46 from the passage<br>
47e.<br>
The slurry and the foam, which entered the area 46a, turn around the<br>
center axis 46b of the conduit 46, and swirl along the circumferential inside<br>
wall surface of the area 46a.   Owing to the swirling motion or turning motion<br>
of the slurry in the area 46a, the slurry and the foam are subjected to shearing<br>
force and are mixed with each other, so that the foam is uniformly dispersed in<br>
the slurry.   The slurry in the conduit 46 gravitationally flows down therein so<br>
as to be discharged to the widthwise center area of the lower sheet 1 through<br>
the conduit 14 (FIG. 1).<br>
Further, the slurry of the peripheral zone is introduced into the conduits<br>
12a, 12b through the fractionation ports 48a, 48b disposed upstream (direction<br>
opposite to rotation) of the ports 41,45, and the slurry is discharged through<br>
the conduits 12a, 12b to the edge zones of the lower sheet 1 (FIG. 1).   The<br>
slurry in the vicinity of the ports 48 is the slurry which has not yet reached the<br>
port 41, i.e., the slurry which has not been fed with the foam.   Therefore, the<br>
slurry delivered to the edge zones through the ports 48 has a relatively high<br>
specific gravity.<br>
Thus, the mixer 10 feeds the slurry with a relatively low specific gravity<br>
through the slurry delivery conduit 46 and the conduit 14 to the center area of<br>
the lower sheet 1, and the slurry with a relatively high specific gravity through<br>
25<br><br>
the ports 48 and the conduits 12 to the respective edge zones of the lower sheet<br>
1.   According to such an arrangement of the mixer 10, both of the slurry with<br>
high specific gravity and the slurry with low specific gravity can be prepared<br>
by the single mixer, so that quantities of slurry with different specific gravities<br>
can be supplied to desired portions of the gypsum board production line.   The<br>
green boards, which are conveyed to the dryer by the gypsum board production<br>
line (FIG. 1), have the slurry with a relatively low specific gravity in their<br>
center areas and the slurry with a relatively high specific gravity in their edge<br>
zones, so that they are uniformly dried by the dryer on the downstream side of<br>
the conveyor line.<br>
Similarly to the aforementioned embodiments, it has been found that the<br>
consumption of foaming agent can be eliminated by approximately 35 %,<br>
when gypsum boards having a core with the specific gravity of 0.65^0.70 are<br>
produced by the mixer 10 with this arrangement.<br>
FIG. 23 includes a transverse cross-sectional view, a side elevational<br>
view and a perspective view showing a structure of the attachment 50 provided<br>
with the port 45, the section 47 and the conduit 40 integrally assembled.<br>
The attachment 50 as shown in FIG. 23 has an arrangement in that an<br>
arcuate body part 57 is formed with the slurry outlet port 45, and that the<br>
hollow connector section 47 and the foam feeding conduit 40 are integrally<br>
assembled on the body part 57.   An arcuate bracket 60 for fixing the body<br>
part 57 on the annular wall 23 is secured on an outside surface of the body part<br>
57.   The bracket 60 is formed with an opening 61 conforming to the port 45.<br>
An upstream end of the section 47 is integrally jointed to the bracket 60, and a<br>
downstream end thereof is integrally jointed to an upper end portion of the<br>
conduit 46.   The annular wall 23 is formed with an opening corresponding to<br>
the body part 57.   As shown in FIG. 23(D), the bracket 60 is fixed to the wall<br>
23 by fixing elements 62 such as bolts, and the circumferencial inside wall<br>
surface 57a of the body part 57 constitutes a part of the wall 23.<br>
According to such an arrangement of the attachment 50, maintenance of<br>
the attachment 50, such as cleaning, repair or replacement of parts, can be<br>
readily performed by detaching the attachment 50 from the wall 23.   If<br>
desired, the attachment 50 can be relatively easily replaced with other<br>
attachments having dimensions, structures or materials of other designs or<br>
specifications.<br>
FIG. 24 includes a transverse cross-sectional view and a side elevational<br>
view showing a modification of the attachment 50.<br>
26<br><br>
The attachment 50' as shown in FIG. 24 has an arrangement in that the<br>
slurry outlet port 45, the slurry delivery conduit 46, the hollow connector<br>
section 47 and that foam feeding conduit 40 are integrally assembled, similarly<br>
to the attachment as shown in FIG. 23.   However, the conduit 40 is connected<br>
to the section 47.   The foam feeding port 41 opens on the wall 47a on the<br>
upstream side of the section 47, and the foam is introduced into the slurry in<br>
the passage 47e from the wall 47a by the port 41.   According to such a<br>
location of the port 41, mixing and stirring of the slurry and the foam<br>
substantially depend on the swirling motion or turning motion of the slurry in<br>
the area 46a.<br>
FIG. 25 includes a front elevational view, a transverse cross-sectional<br>
view and a rear elevational view showing an attachment 50" which is another<br>
modification of the attachment 50.<br>
The attachment 50" as shown in FIG. 25 has a plurality of horizontal<br>
guide members 51 extending in a circumferential direction along the<br>
circumferential inside wall surface of the wall 23.   Both ends of the guide<br>
member 51 are secured to the right and left vertical side walls 53,54 of the<br>
attachment 50".   As illustrated by dotted lines, the vertical side walls 47a, 47b<br>
are jointed to the walls 53,54 at an angel (04) identical with the angle of the<br>
walls 53, 54.   The slurry and the foam entering the slits 52 are subjected to a<br>
strong shearing force upon flowing along the surface of the guide member 51<br>
so as to be mixed with each other.   The slurry and the foam swirl along the<br>
circumferential inside wall surface of the conduit 46, whereby they are further<br>
uniformly mixed by shearing force acting on the slurry and the foam during<br>
swirling or turning motion.   The structure and function of the guide members<br>
51 and the slits 52 are substantially the same as those of the attachment as<br>
shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, and therefore, further detailed explanation thereon<br>
is omitted.<br>
The mixer 10 with the attachment 50" has an effect that is derived from<br>
the embodiment as shown in FIGS. 8 to 16 (effect of the slits 52) and the effect<br>
that is to be obtained from the embodiment as shown in FIGS. 17 to 24 (effect<br>
of swirling flow in the conduit 46).<br>
FIG. 26 is a schematic plan view which geometrically illustrates a<br>
modified arrangement of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 17 to 22.   A<br>
positional relation among the area 10a, the section 47 and the conduit 46 is<br>
geometrically shown in FIG. 25.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment, the section 47 is connected to the<br>
27<br><br>
conduit 46 eccentrically on the side of the wall 23.   In the embodiment as<br>
shown in FIG. 26, however, the section 47 is connected to the conduit 46 in an<br>
eccentric position radially outward of the mixer 10 (on the side opposite to the<br>
wall 23).   Therefore, swirling or turning force in the direction opposite to that<br>
of the aforementioned embodiment is given to the slurry entering the area 46a.<br>
The slurry swirls in a clockwise direction, similarly to the slurry in the mixer<br>
10, so as to undergo the mixing and stirring action.<br>
The present inventors have produced light-weight gypsum boards<br>
(Examples-1 to 6) which have a thickness of 9.5mm, a width of 910mm and a<br>
specific gravity of approximately 0.65.   A mixer of the first embodiment<br>
(FIGS. 2 to 7) has been used for Example-1, a mixer of the second<br>
embodiment (FIGS. 8 to 10) has been used for Examples-2 and 3, and a mixer<br>
of the third embodiment (FIGS. 17 to 26) has been used for Examples-4,5 and<br>
6.   Further, the present inventors have produced lightweight gypsum boards<br>
(Comparative Examples-1 to 5) which have a thickness of 9.5mm, a width of<br>
910mm and a specific gravity of approximately 0.65, using a mixer with<br>
conventional structure.   With respect to the mixed state of the foam in the<br>
slurry, the consumption of the foaming agent, and the production rate of the<br>
gypsum boards (i.e., the conveyance velocity V (FIG.l) of the lower sheet of<br>
paper 1, the slurry 3 and the upper sheet of paper 2), the results of the tests of<br>
Examples-1 to 6 and Comparative Examples-1 to 5 are shown in the table of<br>
FIG. 27.   The mixed state of the foam in the slurry is indicated as the<br>
observed results of core in FIG. 27.   In an examination as to whether the<br>
mixed state is good or bad, broken-out sections of interface of the core and the<br>
liner paper in the produced gypsum boards have been evaluated by visual<br>
observation and photographic observation with use of an electron microscope,<br>
and then the mixed state of the foam in the slurry has been judged.   Further,<br>
the effects of reduction in the consumption of the foaming agent have been<br>
indicated by numerical values, wherein the reference value (achievement index<br>
=100) falls under the reduced consumption in the example which represents<br>
the lowest consumption of foaming agent among all of the tests, and wherein<br>
each of the numeral values as per the effects of reduction in the consumption<br>
of the foaming agent is indicated by a ratio of the reduced consumption<br>
relative to that of the reference value.   Therefore, the value shown in FIG. 27<br>
means that the lower value indicates less reduction in the consumption of the<br>
foaming agent (i.e., more foaming agent is consumed).<br>
Example-1 (the mixer of the first embodiment)<br>
28<br><br>
The mixer 10 as shown in FIGS. 2 to 7 has been used for preparing<br>
gypsum slurry, and the foam has been mixed in the slurry by the foam feeding<br>
conduit 40 immediately before the slurry enters the slurry outlet port 45.   The<br>
flow rate of slurry has been set to be 1 m3/minute, wherein the flow rate of<br>
slurry has been defined and measured as the volume of slurry/minute at the<br>
time of passing through the section of the forming rollers 18 (FIG. 1).   The<br>
flow rate of slurry in the Examples and Comparative Examples as set forth<br>
below has been based on the same definition.   Meanwhile, the slurry is<br>
somewhat dried and defoamed while moving from the slurry delivery conduit<br>
46 to the rollers 18 (FIG. 1), and therefore, the volume of slurry /minute at the<br>
time of passing through the section of the rollers 18 is reduced by<br>
approximately 20%, in comparison with the volume of slurry/minute in the<br>
conduit 46.   For instance, the volume of slurry/minute = 1 m3/minute at<br>
the section of the rollers 18 corresponds to the volume of slurry /minute^ 1.2<br>
m3/minute in the conduit 46.<br>
Example-2 (the mixer of the second embodiment)<br>
The attachment 50 (FIGS. 8^10) has been attached to the slurry outlet<br>
port 45 in the mixer 10 of Example-1.   The gypsum slurry has been prepared<br>
by this mixer 10 and the foam has been mixed into the slurry by the foam<br>
feeding conduit 40, immediately before the port 45.<br>
Example-3 (the mixer of the second embodiment)<br>
The gypsum slurry has been prepared by the same mixer as that of<br>
Example-2, and the foam has been mixed into the slurry by the conduit 40,<br>
immediately before the port 45.   The flow rate of slurry has been set to be 1.5<br>
m3/minute.<br>
Example-4 (the mixer of the third embodiment)<br>
The mixer 10 equipped with the attachment 50 as shown in FIG. 23 has<br>
been used for preparing gypsum slurry, and the foam has been mixed into the<br>
slurry by the conduit 40, immediately before flowing through the port 45.<br>
The slurry mixed with the foam has been brought into a streamline state within<br>
the section 47 and it has flowed into the conduit 46 to make a swirling flow in<br>
the conduit 46.<br>
Example-5 (the mixer of the third embodiment)<br>
The mixer 10 equipped with the attachment 50' as shown in FIG. 24 has<br>
been used for preparing gypsum slurry, and the foam has been mixed into the<br>
slurry within the slurry passage 47e by the conduit 40.   The flow rate of slurry<br>
29<br><br>
has been set to be 1.0 m3/minute.<br>
Exampie-6 (the mixer of the third embodiment)<br>
The mixer 10 equipped with the attachment 50" as shown in FIG. 25 has<br>
been used for preparing gypsum slurry, and the foam has been mixed in the<br>
slurry within the mixing area 10a by the conduit 40.   The flow rate of slurry<br>
has been set to be 1.5 m3//minute.<br>
Comparative Bxample-1<br>
The mixer of Comparative Example-1 has been used, which has been<br>
provided with the foam feeding port disposed in a center area of the upper<br>
plate (inward zone) and an attachment (with slits) similar to that of Examples-2<br>
and 3 attached to the slurry outlet port.   The slurry outlet port has been<br>
connected to the upper end portion of the slurry delivery conduit by means of<br>
the hollow connector section.   In Examples-1 to 5, the foam has been fed to<br>
the slurry by the conduit 40 immediately before the slurry outlet port 45.   In<br>
Comparative Example-1, however, the foam has been fed to the slurry in the<br>
center region of the mixer during preparation.   The slurry with the foam<br>
mixed therein has been conducted through the slits of the slurry outlet port to<br>
the hollow connector section, and the slurry has been introduced through the<br>
slurry passage of the hollow connector section into a center of the slurry<br>
delivery conduit.   The flow rate of slurry has been set to be 1.0 m3//minute.<br>
Comparative Example-2<br>
The attachment has been removed from the mixer of Comparative<br>
Example-1 and the position of the foam feeding port has been changed to a<br>
peripheral zone of the upper plate with respect to the mixer of Comparative<br>
Example-1.   This mixer has been used for preparing the slurry while feeding<br>
the foam to the peripheral zone of the mixer.   The slurry and the foam have<br>
been conducted through the fully opened slurry outlet port to the hollow<br>
connector section and introduced into a center of the slurry delivery conduit<br>
through the slurry passage of the hollow connector section.   The flow rate of<br>
slurry has been set to be 1.0 m3/minute.<br>
Comparative Example-3<br>
The position of the foam feeding port has been changed to the slurry<br>
delivery conduit with respect to the mixer of Comparative Example-2 so as to<br>
prepare the slurry without mixing the foam into the slurry within the mixing<br>
area.   The slurry before mixing of the foam has flowed through the fully<br>
opened slurry outlet port to the hollow connector section and then, entered into<br>
30<br><br>
the center of the slurry delivery conduit, as in Comparative Examples-1 and 2.<br>
The foam has been fed to the slurry in the slurry delivery conduit.   The flow<br>
rate of slurry has been set to be 1.0 m3/minute.<br>
Comparative Example-4<br>
The mixer identical with that of Comparative Example-3 has been used<br>
for preparing the slurry.   As in Comparative Example-3, the foam has been<br>
merely fed to the slurry in the slurry delivery conduit.   The flow rate of slurry<br>
has been set to be 0.8 m3/minute.<br>
Comparative Example-5<br>
The mixer identical with that of Comparative Example-3 has been used<br>
for preparing the slurry.   As in Comparative Example-3, the foam has been<br>
merely fed to the slurry in the slurry delivery conduit.   The flow rate of slurry<br>
has been set to be 0.6 m3/minute.<br>
As is apparent from the results of the tests as shown in FIG. 27, in a case<br>
where the flow rate of slurry was set to be 1.0 m3/minute utilizing the mixer<br>
of Comparative Examples-1 to 3, the consumption of the foaming agent could<br>
not be desirably reduced (Comparative Examples-1 and 2) owing to a<br>
relatively large quantity of foam defoamed in the mixing area under influence<br>
of agitating and mixing; or otherwise, bulging occurred on the gypsum board<br>
(Comparative Example-3), since the foam was not uniformly mixed in the<br>
slurry.   The latter problem was overcome by decreasing the flow rate of slurry<br>
down to 0.8 or 0.6 m3/minute as in Comparative Examples-4 and 5.<br>
However, in such a case, the production rate of gypsum boards were lowered<br>
down to approximately 90 or 70 m/minute (Comparative Examples-4 and 5).<br>
From these results, the following technical matters were clarified:<br>
(i) The consumption of foaming agent cannot be sufficiently reduced by<br>
feeding the foam to the inward zone of the mixer, even if the attachment with<br>
the slits is provided on the slurry outlet port (Comparative Example-1);<br>
(ii) In a condition that the slurry outlet port is fully opened and that the<br>
swirling flow of slurry in the conduit 46 is not used, the consumption of<br>
foaming agent cannot be sufficiently reduced, even if the foam is fed to the<br>
peripheral zone (Comparative Example-2); and<br>
(iii) Using the way of feeding the foam to the slurry delivery conduit, the<br>
consumption of foaming agent might be able to be reduced in accordance with<br>
reduction in the flow rate of slurry.   However, only using this method, the<br>
mixer is not applicable to a high speed production of gypsum boards in which<br>
31<br><br>
preparation of slurry at a relatively high flow rate (equal to or greater than 1 m3<br>
/minute) is required (Comparative Examples-3,4 and 5).<br>
On the other hand, according to the arrangement of the mixer 10 of the<br>
present invention, the consumption of foaming agent can be sufficiently<br>
reduced, even if the flow rate of slurry is set to be equal to or higher than 1.0<br>
m3//minute.   Further, the observed results of the core are desirable.   That is,<br>
stable supply of slurry can be achieved with the foam being stirred and mixed<br>
therein in a good condition.   In addition, the production rate of gypsum<br>
boards can be set to be at a high rate equal to or higher than 115 m/minute,<br>
by the mixer 10 according to the present invention.   Thus, the mixer 10 of the<br>
present invention can achieve reduction in the consumption of foam, and<br>
further, the mixer 10 is applicable to a high speed production method of<br>
gypsum boards to which the conventional mixer was not applicable, thereby<br>
contributing to improvement of productivity of the gypsum boards.<br>
Although the present invention has been described as to preferred<br>
embodiments and examples, the present invention is not limited thereto, but<br>
may be carried out in any of various modifications or variations without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying<br>
claims.<br>
For instance, the arrangement of the mixer according to the present<br>
invention can be equally applied to a mixer other than the pin type of mixer<br>
(e.g., a pinless mixer such as a vane-type mixer), or a mixer with a rotary disc<br>
which is not provided with the tooth configurations on its periphery.<br>
Further, the transverse cross-section of the fluid passage in the slurry<br>
delivery conduit is not limited to a round configuration, but it may be elliptic<br>
or oval.<br>
Furthermore, the purpose of use of the mixer according to the present<br>
invention is not limited to that of a mixer for producing gypsum boards, but it<br>
can be used, in other fields, as a mixer for solid material such as powder, liquid<br>
and foam.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention is applicable to a mixer and a mixing method,<br>
especially a mixer and a mixing method used for a process of producing<br>
gypsum boards.   The present mixer and mixing method enables reduction in<br>
the consumption of foaming agent for the process of producing gypsum boards,<br>
32<br><br>
and speeding up of the gypsum board production line.   Therefore, the present<br>
invention can be preferably applied to a method of producing gypsum boards<br>
where a high speed production rate is required.<br>
