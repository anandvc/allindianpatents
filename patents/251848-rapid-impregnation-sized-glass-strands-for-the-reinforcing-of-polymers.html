				<td>RAPID-IMPREGNATION SIZED GLASS STRANDS FOR THE<br>
REINFORCING OF POLYMERS<br>
The invention relates to glass strands coated with a<br>
sizing composition which are intended for the<br>
reinforcing of organic materials of the polymer type.<br>
It also relates to the sizing composition used to coat<br>
said strands, to the composites incorporating these<br>
strands and to the use of the sized strands in the<br>
manufacture of articles by molding.<br>
Glass strands used for reinforcing are generally<br>
produced industrially from streams of molten glass<br>
flowing from the multiple orifices of a spinneret.<br>
These streams are drawn mechanically in the form of<br>
continuous filaments and are then gathered together<br>
into base strands, which are subsequently collected,<br>
for example by winding off on a rotating support.<br>
Before they are gathered together, the filaments are<br>
coated with a sizing composition by passing over a<br>
suitable device, such as coating rolls.<br>
The sizing composition proves to be essential in<br>
several respects.<br>
During the manufacture of the reinforcing strands, the<br>
sizing composition protects the glass filaments from<br>
the abrasion which occurs when the latter rub at high<br>
speed over the various members which are used to guide<br>
them and to collect them. It also establishes bonds<br>
between the filaments, which makes it possible to give<br>
cohesion to the strand. As the strand is thus rendered<br>
more integral, it is easier to handle, in particular<br>
during weaving operations, and untimely breakages are<br>
avoided.<br>
During the manufacture of composite materials, the<br>
sizing composition promotes the wetting and<br><br>
impregnation of the glass strands by the matrix to be<br>
reinforced, which matrix is generally employed in the<br>
form of a more or less fluid resin. The mechanical<br>
properties of the final composite are for this reason<br>
markedly improved.<br>
The materials	to be reinforced can combine with the<br>
glass strands	in various forms: continuous or cut<br>
strands, mats	of continuous or cut strands, fabrics,<br>
and the like.<br>
The composites which incorporate cut glass strands can<br>
be obtained, inter alia, by the "contact molding"<br>
technique, which consists in coating the inside of an<br>
open mold, without a countermold, with resin to be<br>
reinforced and glass strands of variable length. In the<br>
specific process of "molding by simultaneous spraying",<br>
the resin and the cut strands are sprayed together onto<br>
the inside walls of the mold by means of a "spray gun"<br>
comprising an incorporated cutter capable of severing<br>
the strands drawn off from one or more wound packages,<br>
generally provided in the form of rovings, and of a<br>
device which makes it possible to atomize the resin,<br>
for example fed via a pneumatic pump. This simple and<br>
adjustable process is particularly suited to the one-<br>
off or short-run production of components based on<br>
thermosetting polymers belonging to the family of the<br>
polyesters or epoxides.<br>
The quality of the composites obtained by this process<br>
depends largely on the properties introduced by the<br>
glass strands and thus on the size which coats them.<br>
The target is in particular to obtain compositions<br>
giving a size which can be easily wetted or impregnated<br>
at the surface by the resin in order to provide close<br>
contact between the strands and the resin and to thus<br>
obtain the expected mechanical reinforcing properties.<br>
It is also desired for these compositions to be<br><br>
compatible with rapid processing, in particular for the<br>
strand/resin mixture which is sprayed onto the mold in<br>
the form of overlapping strips to be able to be spread<br>
out uniformly. The subsequent rolling stage, intended<br>
to remove the air bubbles and to provide better<br>
distribution of the strands in the resin, should also<br>
be of short duration.<br>
Furthermore, it is necessary for the sizing composition<br>
to have a degree of "incompatibility" with the resin,<br>
so as to prevent the strands/resin mixture from forming<br>
a compact mass which "collapses" by simple gravity.<br>
Nevertheless, the impregnation of the strand by the<br>
resin should be sufficiently fast so that the<br>
strands/resin mixture can have a satisfactory<br>
"conformability", that is to say that it is capable of<br>
perfectly matching the shape of the mold.<br>
It is also necessary for the cut strands to retain<br>
their integrity and not "to form filaments", namely for<br>
them not to burst, with the release of their<br>
constituent filaments, both during the cutting and<br>
spraying phase and during the rolling/debubbling<br>
operation.<br>
It is thus seen that such compositions are	difficult to<br>
develop as the targeted properties	are rarely<br>
compatible with one another and that it is	consequently<br>
necessary to make compromises.<br>
One of the problems encountered during the<br>
implementation of the process for molding by<br>
simultaneous spraying of strands and of resin is the<br>
short lifetime of the blades with which the spray gun<br>
is provided. Although they are made of hard steel, the<br>
blades of the cutter have a tendency to rapidly wear<br>
out on contact with the glass, which leads to "false<br>
cuts" and the formation of cut strands with a length<br>
greater than that desired. Depending upon the number of<br><br>
blades, their degree of wear and the position which<br>
they occupy on the cutter, it is possible to obtain a<br>
mixture of strands with a length corresponding to a<br>
whole multiple of the expected length. The false cuts<br>
result in an unevenness in the carpet and in poor<br>
"conformability" of the cut strands/resin mixture in<br>
the mold. In addition, the need to have to replace the<br>
old blades at relatively short intervals also results<br>
in an increase in the cost of the components.<br>
Sized glass strands suited to this type of molding,<br>
having an improved ability to be cut, are already<br>
known.<br>
In FR-A-2 755 127, the strands are coated with a<br>
composition which comprises, in addition to adhesion<br>
agents capable of providing the sizing function, the<br>
combination of an aminosilane and of an unsaturated<br>
silane.<br>
In WO-A-02/059055, the sizing composition coating the<br>
glass strands combines at least one bissilane and at<br>
least one unsaturated monosilane chosen from<br>
vinylsilanes and (meth)acrylosilanes.<br>
There exists a need to have available a sizing<br>
composition which makes it possible to meet current<br>
productivity standards, which require having available<br>
strands which can be rapidly impregnated by the resin,<br>
without, however, affecting the other properties of the<br>
strand, and which exhibit a high ability to be cut,<br>
making it possible to increase the longevity of the<br>
cutting blades while producing the least possible<br>
amount of short fibers.<br>
The aim of the present invention is thus to provide a<br>
sizing composition for reinforcing strands, which are<br>
intended in particular for open mold molding and more<br>
particular for molding by simultaneous spraying of<br><br>
glass strands and of resin, which makes it possible to<br>
have rapid impregnation of the strands by the resin and<br>
an improved ability to be cut with limited production<br>
of short fibers.<br>
A subject-matter of the invention is glass strands<br>
coated with an aqueous composition which combines, as <br>
film-forming adhesion agents, at least one polyester,<br>
at least one polyvinyl acetate and at least one<br>
polyurethame.<br>
In the present invention, the term "glass strands<br>
coated with a sizing composition" is understood to mean<br>
glass strands "which have been coated with a sizing<br>
composition which comprises ...", that is to say not<br>
only glass strands coated with the composition in<br>
question as they are obtained at the immediate outlet<br>
of the sizing member or members but also these same<br>
strands after they have been subjected to one or more<br>
other treatments. Mention may be made, as examples of<br>
such treatments, of the drying operations targeted at<br>
removing the solvent from the composition and the<br>
treatments resulting in the polymerization/crosslinking<br>
of some constituents of the sizing composition.<br>
Still within the context of the invention, the term<br>
"strands" should be understood as meaning the base<br>
strands resulting from the gathering together under the<br>
spinneret of a multitude of filaments and the products<br>
derived from these strands, in particular the<br>
assemblages of these base strands into rovings. Such<br>
assemblages can be obtained by simultaneously reeling<br>
off several wound base strand packages and by then<br>
gathering them together into slivers which are wound<br>
off onto a rotating support. It can also be "direct"<br>
rovings with a count (or mass length) equivalent to<br>
that of the assembled rovings obtained by gathering<br>
together filaments directly under the spinneret and<br>
winding onto a rotating support.<br><br>
Still according to the invention, the term "aqueous<br>
sizing composition" is understood to mean a sizing<br>
composition in the form of a solution in which the<br>
liquid phase is composed to 97% by weight of water,<br>
preferably 99% and better still 100%, the remainder<br>
being composed, if appropriate, of one or more<br>
essentially organic solvents which can help in<br>
dissolving some constituents of the sizing composition. <br>
In accordance with the invention, the sizing<br>
composition comprises, as film-forming adhesion agents,<br>
the blend of at least one polyester, of at least one<br>
polyvinyl acetate and of at least one polyurethane. <br>
The polyester makes itpossible to obtain rapid<br>
impregnation by the resin and good conformability of<br>
the strands/resin mixture in the mold. It also confers<br>
stiffness on the glass strands.<br>
The polyester is obtained by reaction of polycarboxylic<br>
acid(s) and/or of anhydride(s) of these acids and of<br>
polyol(s).<br>
Preferably, the acid is chosen from saturated,<br>
unsaturated or aromatic diacids, such as fumaric acid,<br>
isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, the anhydride<br>
is chosen from phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride,<br>
and the polyol is chosen from polyalkylene glycols,<br>
such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, aromatic<br>
polyols, such as bisphenol A or F, and novolaks.<br>
Preference is given to the polyesters obtained by<br>
reaction of phthalic or maleic anhydride and of<br>
bisphenol A or F, and of phthalic and maleic anhydrides<br>
and of propylene glycol.<br>
Generally, the polyester exhibits a molecular weight<br>
which varies from 4000 to 17 000 g/mol.<br><br>
The amount of polyester generally represents 50 to 80%<br>
of the solid materials of the composition, preferably<br>
50 to 70%.<br>
The polyvinyl acetate is important in achieving the<br>
required level of cutting.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyvinyl acetate is <br>
generally less than 80 000 g/mol, preferably less than <br>
70 000 g/mol and better still it is between 40 000 and <br>
65 000 g/mol.<br>
The amount of polyvinyl acetate used generally<br>
represents 10 to 40% by weight of the solid materials<br>
of the sizing composition, preferably 20 to 30%. When<br>
the amount represents less than 10% of the solid<br>
materials, the ability to be cut is not satisfactory<br>
and, when it exceeds 40%, the impregnation of the<br>
strands is inadequate.<br>
The polyurethane renders the strand more integral and<br>
improves its ability to be cut. It also acts as a<br>
lubricant.<br>
The polyurethane is chosen from the polyurethanes<br>
resulting from the reaction of at least one<br>
polyisocyanate and of at least one polyol comprising an<br>
aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic chain.<br>
Preferably, the polyurethane has a molecular weight of<br>
less than 20 000 g/mol, preferably of between 4000 and<br>
15 000 g/mol"!<br>
The amount of polyurethane used generally represents 8<br>
to 15% by weight of the solid materials of the sizing<br>
composition, preferably 8 to 10%.<br>
Preferably, the sum of the contents by weight of<br><br>
polyester, of polyvinyl acetate and of polyurethane<br>
represents at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, of<br>
the solid materials of the sizing composition.<br>
In addition to the abovementioned components which<br>
participate essentially in the structure of the size,<br>
the sizing composition can advantageously comprise one<br>
or more other components (hereinafter denoted as<br>
"additives"). The sizing composition can thus comprise<br>
a lubricating agent in an amount which can represent up<br>
to 5% by weight of the solid materials of the sizing<br>
composition.<br>
In addition to this role of protecting the filaments<br>
from mechanical abrasion, the lubricant contributes to<br>
limiting the formation of short fibers, to increasing<br>
the stiffness of the strand and to preventing adhesive<br>
bonding of the wraps on the wound base strand packages.<br>
Generally, this agent is chosen from cationic compounds<br>
of the polyalkyleneimide type and nonionic compounds of<br>
the esters of fatty acids and of poly(alkylene<br>
glycol)s/poly(oxyalkylene) type, such as polyethylene<br>
glycol monolaurate, or of the poly(oxyalkylenated)<br>
fatty amides type, such as polyoxyethylenated<br>
hydrogenated tallow amides.<br>
The sizing composition can also comprise at least one<br>
coupling agent which makes it possible to attach the<br>
size to the surface of the glass filaments. The<br>
coupling agent is generally chosen from silanes, such<br>
as Y-glycidoxypropyltrimenthoxysilane acryoyloxy-<br>
propyltrimethoxysilane, y-methacryloyloxypropyltri-<br>
methoxysilane, P°ly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene)tri-<br>
methoxysilane, y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, vinyl-<br>
trimethoxysilane, phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane or<br>
styrylaminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, siloxanes,<br>
titanates, zirconates, in particular of aluminum, and<br>
mixtures of these compounds. Preferably, silanes are<br><br>
 chosen.<br>
Advantageously, te composition comprises at least two<br>
coupling agents, at least one of which is an<br>
unsaturated silane and the other of which is an<br>
aminosilane. A particularly advantageous combination<br>
comprises at least one silane including an acrylic or<br>
methacrylic functional group and an aminosilane chosen<br>
from bis (y-trimethoxysilylpropyl)silane and bis (y-<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl)silane. In particular, by<br>
adjusting the ratio by weight of the unsaturated silane<br>
to the aminosilane, it is possible to regulate tha<br>
amount of "oversize" to be applied to the base strands,<br>
as is indicated later. The ratio generally varies from<br>
1:1.5 to 1:6, preferably from 1:2 to 1:5. The higher<br>
the ratio, the lower the amount of oversize to be<br>
deposited.<br>
The amount of couplincg agent generally varies from 1 to<br>
6% by weight of the solid materials of the sizing<br>
composition, is preferably greater than 1.5% and is<br>
generally of the order of 2%.<br>
It is also possible to introduce, as additive, an<br>
antistatic agent, such as lithium chloride, in an<br>
amount representing less than 5% by weight of the solid<br>
materials of the sizing composition.<br>
The glass strands coated with the sizing composition in<br>
accordance with the invention exhibit a loss on<br>
ignition of less than 2.2%, preferably of greater than<br>
1% and better still of between 1.0 and 1.45%.<br>
Generally, the glass strands in accordance with the<br>
invention are provided in the form of wound base strand<br>
packages which are subjected to a heat treatment. This<br>
treatment is intended essentially to remove the water<br>
introduced by the sizing composition and, if<br>
appropriate, makes it possible to accelerate the<br><br>
crosslinking of the film-forming adhesion agents. The<br>
conditions of the treatment can vary according to the<br>
weight of the wound package. The drying is generally<br>
carried out at a temperature of the order of 110 to<br>
140°C for several hours, preferably 12 to 18 hours.<br>
As has already been said, the base strands thus<br>
obtained are generally removed from the wound package<br>
and combined with several other base strands into a<br>
sliver which is subsequently wound onto a rotating<br>
support to form a roving. The "oversize" application of<br>
a composition including a cationic antistatic agent of<br>
the quaternary ammonium salt type to the strands makes<br>
it possible to reinforce the ability of the strands to<br>
be cut. Consequently, the deposition of the<br>
abovementioned composition on the base strands, after<br>
removing from the wound package and gathering together<br>
to form the sliver, contributes to improving the<br>
ability to be cut and consequently increases the<br>
lifetime of the blades. The strands are preferably<br>
coated with an aqueous composition comprising 20 to 35%<br>
by weight of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride,<br>
preferably of the order of 25% by weight.<br>
The amount of "oversize" deposited generally represents<br>
0.02 to 0.2% by weight of the strand, preferably 0.05<br>
to 0.10%.<br>
The strands coated with the sizing composition<br>
according to the invention can be composed of glass of<br>
any nature provided that it is capable of being<br>
fiberized, for example of E, C or AR (alkali-resistant)<br>
glass or glass with a low level of boron (less than<br>
5%) . E glass and glass with a low level of boron are<br>
preferred.<br>
These same strands are composed of filaments with a<br>
diameter which can vary within a wide range, for<br>
example 9 to 17 urn, preferably 11 to 13 urn.<br><br>
The strands advantageously have a count of between 30<br>
and 160 tex, preferably 40 and 60 tex. Such cut glass<br>
strands are evenly and homogeneously distributed within<br>
the resin, which makes it possible to have<br>
reinforcement of excellent quality.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is the sizing<br>
composition capable of coating said glass strands,<br>
which composition is characterized in that it comprises<br>
an aqueous blend of at least one polyester, of at least<br>
one polyvinyl acetate and of at least one polyurethane<br>
as are defined above.<br>
The sizing composition is an aqueous blend comprising<br>
the constituents below in the following contents by<br>
weight, expressed as percentages of the solid<br>
materials:<br>
•	50 to 80% of at least one polyester, preferably 50 to<br>
70%,<br>
•	10 to 40% of at least one polyvinyl acetate,<br>
preferably 20 to 30%,<br>
•	8 to 15% of at least one polyurethane, preferably 8<br>
to 10%,<br>
•	0 to 5% of at least one lubricating agent,<br>
•	1 to 6% of at least one coupling agent, preferably<br><br>
equal to or greater than 1.5%. <br>
Advantageously, the sizing composition comprises<br>
between 5 and 15% by weight of solid materials,<br>
preferably between 6 and 11%. Advantageously, the<br>
liquid phase is composed to 100% of water.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is also the<br>
composites comprising the glass strands coated with the<br>
sizing composition. Such composites comprise at least<br>
one thermosetting material, preferably a polyester, a<br>
vinyl ester, an acrylic polymer, a phenolic resin or an<br>
epoxy resin, and glass strands composed, in all or<br>
part, of glass strands in accordance with the<br><br>
invention.<br>
The level of glass within the composite is generally<br>
between 20 and 45% by weight and preferably between 25<br>
and 35%.<br>
In addition to their advantages related to the<br>
processing by molding (rapid rate of impregnation and<br>
good ability to be cut, combined with the limited<br>
formation of short fibers), the glass strands confer,<br>
on the composites which include them, better resistance<br>
to aging, in particular in a moist environment.<br>
A further subject matter of the invention is the use of<br>
the glass strands coated with the sizing composition<br>
for the production of components by the open mold<br>
molding technique, in particular by simultaneous<br>
spraying of said strands and of resin.<br>
Another subject matter of the invention is the use of<br>
said glass strands for the production of pipes by the<br>
centrifuging technique, which consists in<br>
simultaneously spraying the strands and a resin into a<br>
rotating mold, the impregnation of the strands being<br>
carried out by virtue of the centrifugal force.<br>
The following examples make it possible to illustrate<br>
the invention without, however, limiting it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
A sizing composition is prepared in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution comprising, as % by weight of the<br>
solid materials:<br>
• film-forming adhesion agents<br>
-	polyvinyl acetate'11; molecular<br>
weight 50 000	60.1<br>
-	vinyl acetate/N-methylolacrylamide<br>
copolymer'2'	21.9<br><br>
•	coupling agents<br>
-	diaminosilane(3)	1.3<br>
-	vinyltriethoxysilane(4)	2.1<br>
•	plasticizer<br>
-	mixture of diethylene glycol dibenzoate<br>
and of propylene glycol dibenzoate(5)<br>
(50:50 ratio by weight)	9.8<br>

•	water: amount sufficient to give 100 ml of<br>
sizing composition.<br>
The sizing composition is prepared in the following<br>
way:<br>
The alkoxy groups of the silane(3) and silane(4) are<br>
hydrolyzed by addition of acid to an aqueous solution<br>
of this silane kept stirred.<br>
The other constituents are subsequently introduced,<br>
still with stirring, and the pH is adjusted to a value<br>
of 4 ± 0.2, if necessary.<br>
The sizing composition is used to coat, in a known way,<br>
filaments of E glass with a diameter of approximately<br>
12 µm drawn from glass streams flowing from the<br>
orifices of a spinneret, the filaments subsequently<br>
being gathered together in the form of wound base<br>
strand packages with a count equal to 60 tex.<br>
The wound package is dried at 130°C for 12 hours.<br>
The base strands extracted from 7 wound packages are<br>
coated with an aqueous solution comprising 25% by<br>
weight of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (amount<br>
deposited on a dry basis: 0.05%) .<br><br>
The strand unwound from the roving is inserted into a<br>
cutting device comprising two blades, one made of hard<br>
steel and the other made of rapidly wearing "soft"<br>
steel (heat treatment at 550°C), and equipped with<br>
strength and temperature sensors. The cutting, carried<br>
out at 20°C under a relative humidity of 50%, is<br>
adjusted in order to form cut strands with a length of<br>
50 mm. The ability to be cut is measured by the weight<br>
of the glass strands which can be cut until the<br>
appearance of strands with twice the length<br>
(2 x 50 mm) . The value 1 is assigned to the weight of<br>
cut strands obtained, which value is used here as<br>
reference value for measuring the ability to be cut.<br>

EXAMPLES 15 TO 17<br>
The strands obtained according to examples 2 and 10<br>
(examples 15 and 16) and according to comparative<br>
example 7 (example 17) are used to manufacture<br>
composite components by the technique of molding by<br>
simultaneous spraying under the following conditions:<br>
-	the glass strand removed from the roving is<br>
introduced into a spray gun (Venus from Matrasur)<br>
which makes it possible to cut it and to spray it<br>
simultaneously with an unsaturated polyester resin<br>
(Enydyne D05 4500 TY, sold by Cray Valley) with a<br>
viscosity equal to 4.5 dPa-s at 25°C, with high<br>
reactivity and thixotropic,<br>
-	the mold into which the cut strands and the resin<br>
are sprayed is a mold in the form of a staircase<br>
which comprises a vertical wall with a height of<br>
1 m, then a stair with a depth of 0.20 m and a<br>
height of 0.2m, and finally a horizontal wall<br>
with a length of 1 m. The horizontal wall<br><br>
comprises two grooves with a depth of 2 cm which<br>
make it possible to evaluate the conformation of<br>
the cut strands/resin mixture,<br>
-	the mixture sprayed onto the mold includes 30% by<br>
weight of glass and has a mean thickness of the<br>
order of 3 mm.<br>
The performances of the cut strands/resin mixture are<br>
evaluated for the following parameters:<br>
-	evenness of the carpet<br>
-	vertical wall strength<br>
-	rate of impregnation of the cut strands by the<br>
resin.<br>
The evaluation relating to these parameters is measured<br>
visually according to the following scale of values:<br>
1 = very bad; 2 = bad; 3 = fairly good; 4 = good and<br>
5 = very good.<br>
The performances of the strands are collated in table 2<br>
below:<br>
Table 2<br>
Ex. 15	Ex. 16	Ex. 17<br>
Strand Ex. 2	Ex. 10	Ex. 7<br>
Dispersion of the carpet 4.5	4	3.5<br>
Vertical wall strength 2.5	4.5	2<br>
Rate of impregnation 4	4	4<br>
On reading the table, it is found that the strands<br>
according to the invention (examples 2 and 3) , which<br>
combine a polyester, a polyvinyl acetate and a<br>
polyurethane as film-forming adhesion agents, exhibit a<br>
better ability to be cut than the strands comprising<br>
only one or two of these agents (examples 4 to 6) , at<br>
an equivalent loss on ignition. The amount of short<br>
fibers formed is low, of the same level as for examples<br>
4 to 6 and much lower than that of the strands of<br><br>
example 7.<br>
The ability to be cut is improved when the content of<br>
"oversize" is greater (example 3).<br>
The strands having lower contents of lubricating agent<br>
(examples 8 and 9) and of coupling agent (example 10)<br>
have a high ability to be cut and moderate production<br>
of short fibers.<br>
The combination of an unsaturated silane and of an<br>
aminosilane makes it possible to obtain strands having<br>
a high ability to be cut without oversize (example 14),<br>
this ability greatly increasing when the content of<br>
oversize increases (examples 12 and 13).<br>
Table 2 shows that the strands according to the<br>
invention (examples 15 to 17) retain a high rate of<br>
impregnation under the conditions of the spraying,<br>
equivalent to that of the strands of comparative<br>
example 7, with, however, an improved vertical wall<br>
strength and evenness of the carpet.<br>
These strands obtained in the context of the invention<br>
exhibit an excellent compromise between the ability to<br>
be cut, the production of short fibers and the<br>
conditions of molding by simultaneous spraying of<br>
resin.<br>
EXAMPLES 18 AND 19<br>
The ability of the strand according to example 10<br>
(example 18) to be used to manufacture pipes by the<br>
centrifuging technique by simultaneous spraying of cut<br>
strands and of resin into a rotating mold is evaluated<br>
by comparison with a known strand suitable for this use<br>
(sold by PPG under the reference 6428; example 20).<br>
The integrity of the strand is measured under the<br><br>
following conditions: the strand reeled off from a<br>
roving is introduced into a Wolfangel 500 cutter, which<br>
cuts it and sprays it substantially horizontally onto a<br>
vertical wall (cutting rate: 600 m/min; length: 12 mm).<br>
The integrity of the cut strand is determined visually<br>
according to a scale of values ranging from 1 (bad;<br>
fluffy appearance) to 5 (very good; no rupturing of the<br>
strand).<br>
The ability to be cut is measured under the conditions<br>
of example 1.<br>
Example 19 Example 2 0<br>
Integrity	4.5	4.5<br>
Ability to be cut	2.40	0.95<br>
The strand according to the invention exhibits a<br>
markedly improved ability to be cut in comparison with<br>
the known strand and an identical integrity.<br>
