				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular with a multi-stage drafting unit, to whose output roller pair a suction device, a suction drum in particular with a perforated area extending over its circumference, is being arranged. On the surface of said suction drum, extending along a path section being located in particular between a drafting unit counter output roller and a twist-locking counter roller forming a twist-locking gap together with the suction drum, a guide surface is being formed for both parts of a fibre band being separated thereon or for two fibre bands being led thereto parallel side by side, in order to form a condenser stage, where the two fibre bands, which already have received their final drafting, but which have not yet been twisted, are being condensed or twisted into a compact fibre band. Furthermore the invention is concerned with the production of a spun ply yarn and a spun ply yarn as such.<br><br>
With already known spinning frames of this type (DE 195 00 036, DE 196 08 697) each compact fibre band having been formed on the suction drum is spun into a single yarn after leaving the twist-locking gap. If a ply yarn is to be produced, then several yarns, having been produced in this manner, are being twisted into one ply yarn.<br><br>
It is also already known (EP 0444 486 A2) to merge two fibre slivers behind the output roller of a drafting unit comprising solid cylinders and to process them by means of a spindle and an essentially freely rotatable bell, into kind of a ply yarn type textile thread. <br>
The ply yarn characteristic of a textile thread having been produced by this method is, however, of insufficient quality.<br><br>
Further it has already been disclosed (AT-PS 398 086) to split a fibre sliver into two parts on a suction roller being provided at the output side of a multi-stage drafting unit, which then, however, are being merged before reaching the twist-locking gap, so that in the end the spun yarn is being formed in known manner from a single fibre strand.<br><br>
It is the objective of the present invention to provide a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, and a method of the above mentioned kind, which enable the production of a considerably improved spun ply yarn.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to be seen in the fact that not only two fibre bands, coming for instance from a roving bobbin, but that two condensed fibre bands on a suction device, in particular on a suction drum, are being merged together, in particular after the twist-locking gap and that they are being twisted, ply-yarn-like with one another, whereat at the same time each of the single compact fibre bands receives a certain, sufficient degree of spinning twist.<br><br>
By compaction of the fibre bands or the slivers respectively, the strengths of the fibre bands is increased considerably and the hairiness, disturbing the twisting process, is being reduced. This way one can operate at a particularly low twist count, which again leads to a higher production rate. In the weaving mill such ply yarns can be used as warp yarn, without the need of sizing. For knitting, paraffin application is not necessary.<br><br>
It is particularly preferable if, for the two condensed fibre bands, the distance of the merging point from the twist-locking gap amounts to between 5 and 15 mm and in particular to approximately 10 mm. The lateral distance between the two condensed fibre bands at the twist-locking gap should amount to between 5 and 10 mm, 7 mm in particular. <br><br>
It is preferable to arrange right behind the twist-locking gap a device, which in case of a breakage of one condensed fibre band also causes a breakage of the other condensed fibre band, as is known from the above mentioned EP 0444 086 A2.<br><br>
A further advantage of the spinning frame according to the invention, of the method according to the invention respectively, is the fact that for the first time also cotton can be processed by way of the spinning twist operation.<br>
With the spun ply yarn according to the invention a subsequent process of twisting, doubling etc. can be avoided, so that overall a considerably more economical production is assured.<br><br>
On the spinning machine itself the invention can be realised in that the creel is being furnished with twice the number of roving bobbins. Another possible way with an existing spinning frame would be to leave out every other spindle.<br>
With regard to the invention it is of particular importance that the two condensed fibre bands are being guided separately until they reach the twist-locking gap and that they are being combined into a ply yarn only after said gap, on their way towards the spinning unit.<br><br>
There is also inventive protection being claimed for a spun ply yarn as such being produced with the spinning frame and method according to the invention. <br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, with at least one multi-stage drafting unit being fed with fibre bands from one or two roving bobbin(s) or from one or two sliver band can(s), whereby at the output roller pair of said multi-stage drafting unit a suction device with a perforated area extending over the circumference, is being arranged, which, along a path section on its circumference forms a guiding surface for both parts of a band being separated at that path or for two bands being fed parallel side by side, in order to form a condenser stage, where the fibre bands, which already have received their final drafting, but which had possibly only partially or not at all been twisted, are being condensed or bundled respectively, into a compact fibre band of not more than 1.5 but not less than 1 mm width, whereat along the path section being moved along with the band, two defined suction zones are being provided within a shield which are located radially within the perforated area of the suction area, and which suction zones are spaced in axial direction and whereby said suction zones guide one fibre band each in general circumferential direction, which fibre bands are preferably separated by a slight lateral distance from each other, and with only one spinning unit preferably a ring spinning unit, following thereafter, which produces, from the two condensed fibre bands, a ply yarn as a result of imparting a twisting turn to the fibre bands and at the same time a spinning twist.<br><br>
In the following the invention is described by example of the drawings, wherein show figure 1 a schematical side view of a spinning frame according to the invention<br>
figure 2 a schematical front view of the object of figure 1 and<br>
figure 3 a corresponding partial front view of figure 1 in a<br><br>
somewhat enlarged scale of a spinning frame operating with only one sliver being led to the multi-stage drafting unit.<br><br>
According to figures 1 and 2 from two roving bobbins 12 being arranged in a not further shown machine frame, two flyer slivers 11 are being led parallel over redirecting elements 28 into a three cylinder drafting unit 13, said drafting unit being provided with a preliminary drafting zone 23, with a feed roller pair 37, 37' and a main drafting zone 24. <br>
The roller pair 29, 29' at the end of the preliminary drafting zone 23 and at the beginning of the main drafting zone 24 is furnished in known manner with a small belt 30, 30' each, schematically indicated, which reaches into the entering gap 14 of a pair of output rollers 25, 26.<br><br>
The lower one of the pair of output rollers is made as a perforated suction drum 25 with a turning axis 36, said suction drum being provided with a considerably larger diameter than the other rollers and which, together with a drafting unit counter output roller 26, forms the last clamping gaps 14 of the drafting unit 13.<br>
After passing the clamping gap 14, the fibre bands, having been led through the drafting unit 13 so far, are then led along a curved path section 15 over a part of the circumference of the suction drum 25 as far as to a twist-locking counter roller 27, which, together with the suction drum 25, forms a twist-locking gap 16 for the fibre bands.<br><br>
The perforated area 35 of the suction drum 25 according to figure 2 extends over the whole circumference of the suction drum 25, however, only over a sufficiently large axial width, which also takes into account a possible traversing movement of the fibre bands 22, 22', so that the two fibre bands 22, 22' are kept continuously in contact with the perforated area 35 between the clamping gap 14 and the twist-locking gap.<br>
Within the suction drum 25, there is a shield 32, being concentrically bent in relation with said drum, said shield being suitably interrupted in the area of the path section and arranged in such a way, that due to a vacuum being maintained inside the shield 32, an airstream is generated, which flows from outside towards the inner side, in the direction shown by arrows 34 in figure 1, within the perforated area 35 of the suction drum 25.<br>
Following the twist-locking gap 16 the two condensed fibre bands emerging from the twist-locking gap 16 are twisted into a spun ply yarn 39, which thereafter is led to a classical ring spinning unit 17, being provided with a ring rail 18, a ring 19, a traveller 20, a spindle 21 and one single spindle rail 38 being provided for all spindles, so that on the spindle 21 one spun ply yarn results from two condensed fibre bands.<br>
The total drafting within the drafting unit 13 amounts to preferably the 80- to 100-fold, whereby the drafting within the preliminary drafting zone 23 only ranges within the usual limits of a 1, 1 - 1, 3-fold value.<br><br>
As is shown in figure 2, the opening within the shield 32 defines two suction zones 33, 33', which are spaced in axial direction, which generally extend in circumferential direction of the suction drum 25, the fibre forwarding direction 31 respectively, and which converge towards each other in the direction of the spinning unit 17. <br>
The two suction zones (33, 33') is provided with a limitation which at least partially is not in alignment with the circumferential direction of the suction drum (25). In the exemplified embodiment according to figure 2, one of the ends of the axially spaced suction zones 33,33', with regard	 to the fibre band forwarding direction 31, is located immediately behind the outlet side of the clamping gap 14 between the suction drum 25 and the drafting unit counter output roller 26, that is where the slivers 11 enter. In this area the suction zones 33, 33' are spaced at the largest distance. Afterwards the two suction zones 33, 33' become narrower, mirror-symmetrically, towards the middle axis running in circumferential direction, in order to form nearly parallel or slightly converging slots within the end section of the zone.<br><br>
While in the embodiment according to figure 2 the convergence of the suction zone 33, 33' begins at a circumferential position 42 that coincides with the clamping gap 14 of the suction drum 25 (figure 2), the corresponding circumferential position 42' in the embodiment according to figure 3 is at a distinct circumferential distance away from the clamping gap 14 with respect to the fibre band forwarding direction 31. This is necessary, because in the embodiment according to figure 3 only one sliver 11 is led to the multi-stage drafting unit 13 and after the clamping gap 14 at first the single fibre band, by a generally known divergence of the suction zone 33, 33', has to be formed into two separate fibre bands 22, 22' . The formation of two fibre bands 22, 22' is assisted by a blowing tube 40 extending into the divergence zone, as is indicated by dotted lines in figure 1.<br><br>
As soon as two separate fibre bands 22, 22' are formed at a distinct axial distance, whereby the distance has to be large enough, so that bridge-forming between the two fibre bands 22, 22' is avoided to a large extent; begins, starting from the circumferential position 42' in fibre band forwarding direction 31, a convergence of the two suction zones 33, 33' analogue to figure 2, whereby, however, here the available circumferential area is being shorter so that either the angle of convergence in relation to figure 2 has to be increased or otherwise the value of the total convergence has to be reduced. A further possibility is to increase the diameter of the suction drum 25, thereby increasing the length of the path section 15.<br><br>
In the exemplified embodiment according to figure 3, there too the two condensed fibre bands being produced on the suction drum 25, are only then being merged together after they have passed the twist-locking gap 16, whereafter which they are being twisted into a spun ply yarn 39. <br>
