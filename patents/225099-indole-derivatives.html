INDOLES USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF ANDROGEN-RECEPTOR RELATED DISEASES<br>
The invention relates to indole derivatives, their preparation and their use for the treatment of androgen-receptor related conditions, disorders or diseases and other androgen related treatments.<br>
Compounds possessing androgenic activity are useful in the treatment of men with low endogenous levels of circulating androgenic hormones or men with suppressed androgenic effects. Such treatments are prescribed to older men, to hypogonadal men or men treated with progestagens for male contraception. In addition, potent androgens suppress spermatogenesis and can be used as male contraceptives.<br>
It is thus important to obtain compounds with high affinity for the androgen receptor. Non-steroidal compounds with high affinity for the androgen receptor are particularly useful since they may have different tissue distribution characteristics than steroidal androgens and can be designed by proper choice of substituents to be more or less selective for certain tissues. For example, an action in the brain is usually prevented when compounds are strongly hydrophilic or carry an ionic charge.<br>

Substituted indole compounds of structure 3 were prepared in two steps from the correctly substituted indoles of strucrure 1, via two different routes. In the first route a correctly substituted indole of structure 1 isN-alkylated with a halide of type R CH:Y, where Y is a halogen, mesylate or tosylate, with NaH or CS2CO3 as a base in DMF or NMP at 0°C to room temperature, to give a compound of structure 2. Structure 2 is then sulfanylated at the C-3 position of the indole ring by reaction with a sulfenyl chloride in either CH2CI2 or diethyl ether at room temperature, to give structure 3. In the second route the two steps of the first route are reversed: the correctly substituted indole of structure 1 is first sulfanylated at the C-3 position of the indole to give structure 4; followed by N-alkylation with R^CHiY to 'give structure 3 (Scheme I).<br><br><br><br>
(Structure 8), C02H (Structure 9), CONHMe (Structure 10), CONH2 (Structure 11) or CN (Structure 12).<br><br>
In the first step a substituted indole of structure 6 is sulfanylated at the 3-position with 2-(carboxymethyl)-phenylsulfenyl chloride, which was prepared from methylthiosalicyiate and chlorine gas. to give a compound of structure 7. Reduction of the methyl ester moiety of compounds of structure 7 with LiAlH4 gave the corresponding hydroxymethyl compounds of structure 8. Saponification of the methyl<br><br><br><br>
triethylamine in CH2CI2 afforded the corresponding benzonitrile compound of structure 17 (Scheme IV).<br><br>
Scheme V describes the synthesis of compounds of structure 22 containing an acylated amine functionality on the 6-position of the indole ring. These compounds can be synthesised from 6-nitro indoles of structure 18 in 4 steps. In the first step the indole of structure 18 is alkylated on the nitrogen atom by reaction of a halide of type lOCHsY, in which Y is halogen, mesylate or tosylate, with NaH as a base in DMF to give compounds of structure 19. In the second step the nitro group of structure 19 is reduced to an amine group by SnCl2 to give structure 20. Subsequent acylation of the amine group with an acid chloride of type ZCOC1 afforded structure 21, which was then sulfanylated at the 3-position of the indole ring by reaction with a sulfenyl chloride in either CH2CI2 or Et20 as a solvent, at room temperature, to give compounds of structure<br><br>
22. Direct sulfanylation of a compound of structure 20 with a sulfenyl chloride afforded structure 23<br>
In Scheme VI is decribed how methyl ethers of structure 24 can be cleaved with e.g. BF3DMS in THF at room temperature to hydroxy compounds of structure 25.<br><br>
Scheme VII describes the synthesis of compounds containing either an acylated amine functionality (structure 28) or a sulfonamide functionality (structure 29) at the 6-position of the indole ring. These compounds can be prepared from 6-nitro indoles of structure 18 in 6 steps. In the fust step the indole of structure 18 is alkylated on N-l by reaction of a halide of type RlCH2Y, in which Y is a halogen, mesylate or tosylate. with NaH or CS2CO3 as a base in either NMP or DMF to give compounds of structure 19. In the second step the nitro group of structure 19 is reduced to an amine group with Fe and NH4CI in an ethanol/water mixture to give structure 20. Subsequent acylation of the amine group with di-/er/-butyl dicarbonate afforded structure 26 which was then sulfanylated at the 3-position of the indole ring by reaction with a sulfenyl chloride in either CH2CI2 or Et20 to give compounds of structure 27. Then the amide functionality at the 6-position of the indole was cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid or HCOOH to give amines of structure 23. These amines can be converted into amides of structure 28 by reaction with either triethyiamine and an acid chloride in CH2CI2 (method a) or an acid, TBTU and DIPEA in CH2C12 (method b). Sulfonamides of structure 29 can be prepared by reaction of amines of structure 23 with sulfonyl chlorides (method c).<br><br><br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the nonsteroidal compound according to the invention mixed with a pharmaceutical!}' acceptable auxiliary, such as described in the standard reference Gennaro et ah Remmington: The Science and Practice of 'Pharmacy, (20th ed.? Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing). Suitable auxiliaries are made available in e.g. the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (2n Edition, Editors A. Wade and PJ. Weller; American Pharmaceutical Association; Washington; The Pharmaceutical Press; London, 1994).

compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutical^ suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied as an injection preparation in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. nasal spray. For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. The compounds of the invention may also be included in an implant, a vaginal ring, a patch, a gel, and any other preparation for sustained release.<br>
Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof used in suitable amounts.<br>
The dosage amounts of the present compounds will be of the normal order for pharmaceutically active compounds, e.g. of the order of 0.001 to 50 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per administration. The recipient can be a human or an animal in need of an androgen receptor-related treatment or an androgen treatment.<br><br>
