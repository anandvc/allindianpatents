TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A neem oil based wound healing ointment or cream<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Name : Godrej Agrovet Limited<br>
Nationality : an Indian Company<br>
Address  :  Pirojshanagar,  Eastern Express     Highway,  Vikhroli (East),<br>
Mumbai 400079, Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
20-9-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
FIELD OF   INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a neem oil based wound healing ointment or cream.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Antibacterial and antifungal properties of neem oil are known. It is, however, difficult and cumbersome to apply and retain neem oil on the wounds for healing purpose due to the free flowing nature of the oil. Therefore, use of neem oil for wound healing application is inconvenient, cumbersome and time consuming. Regeneration of tissues is an integral part of healing. Activities such as cell proliferation, smoothening of the skin or restoration of the epithelial cells also facilitate healing. Linseed oil, salicylic acid and zinc oxide are reported to possess these activities. Antiseptic properties of salicylic acid and zinc oxide are also reported. [The Merck India- 12th Edition 1996, Publ: Merck &amp; Co Inc, NJ, USA].<br>
2<br><br>

100°C;<br>
ii)      mixing   10 to 20% by weight of neem oil and 5 to 15% by weight<br>
of linseed oil with the additive base   melt under stirring followe d by<br>
cooling  the  mixture to 30 to 55 ° C;<br>
(iii)    and further mixing  the mixture obtained by step (ii)with   1.5 to<br>
3.0% by weight of zinc  oxide, 0.5 to 2.0% by  weight of salicylic acid<br>
and 0.5 to 2.0 % by weight of potassium nitrate under stirring.<br>
Preferably, the process comprises      mixing   the additive base, namely bees wax and petroleum jelly   in the weight    ratio 15 : 40 to 25 : 70.<br>
Preferably the process comprises the steps of<br>
ia)     melting 72.2% by weight of the additive base namely bees wax<br>
and petroleum jelly in the weight ratio  23 : 77;<br>
iia)     mixing    16.5% by weight  of neem oil and 8.2%  by  weight  of<br>
linseed oil with the additive base melt followed by  cooling the mixture<br>
and<br>
6<br><br>
iiia) further mixing the mixture obtained by step (iia) with 1.5% by weight of zinc oxide, 0.8% by weight of salicylic acid and 0.8% by weight of potassium nitrate.<br>
Preferably the additive base is melted   at 75 ° C.<br>
Preferably  the mixture of step (ii) and (iia) is cooled  to 40 ° C.<br>
Besides bees wax and petroleum jelly other additive bases such as paraffin wax, salts and esters of fatty acids, fatty alcohols or hydrogenated wax may also be used in the  ointment or cream of the  invention.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a method of treatment of wounds by applying topically the neem oil based wound healing ointment  or cream described above.<br>
This application has been divided out of our Indian Patent Application No 488/MUM/2004 filed on 27th April 2004.<br>
7<br><br>
The   medicament of  the invention may be   used   on any   mammalian species.<br>
The following experimental example is illustrative of the invention but not limitative  of the scope thereof:<br>
Example 1 Bees wax (16.6 % by weight) and petroleum jelly (55.6% by weight) were melted at 75 °C. Neem oil (16.5% by weight) and linseed oil (8.2% by weight) were added to the melt and stirred well for half an hour. After cooling the mixture to 40°C, zinc oxide (1.5% by weight), salicylic acid (0.8% by weight) and potassium nitrate ( 0.8% by weight) were added to it and stirred well for further one hour to form an ointment. The wound healing efficacy of the ointment was studied on fresh wounds in dogs and cattle and the  results    were as given in the following Tables:<br>
8<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Data   on wound  healing in dogs<br><br>
Medicament	Time    taken    to start wound healing  in days (Mean ± S.E)	Time taken for complete wound healing in days (Mean ±SE)<br>
Neem oil	4.13 ±0.61	23.4 ±3.64<br>
Ointment of Example 1	2.66 ± 0.33	15.5 ±1.80<br>
Acrilin ointment	2.33 ± 0.33	15.33 ±1.05<br>
Table 2 Data on wound healing in cattle<br><br>
Medicament	Time    taken    to start wound healing  in days (Mean ± S.E)	Time taken for complete wound healing in days (Mean ±SE)<br>
Neem oil	6.21 ± 1.13	39.2 ±4.13<br>
Ointment of Example 1	2.63 ±0.31	27.3 ±1.35<br>
Acrilin ointment	3.00 ±0.26	30.33 ±2.65<br>
The frequency   of  application of the medicaments   on the wounds was<br>
twice daily namely morning and evening. Acrilin comprising gamma benzene hexachloride, proflavin hemisulphate and cetrimide is a commercially available ointment of M/s. GSK Agrivet, India for wound healing.<br>
9<br><br>
It is quite evident from Tables 1 and 2 that the ointment of the invention showed improved wound healing properties as compared to neem oil alone and that the wound healing properties of the ointment of the invention were comparable to those of commercially available ointment namely Acrilin. The ointment of the invention is easy and convenient to apply on wounds. It is economical because neem oil and the other ingredients are cheap and easily available. The ointment of the invention is also safe and without side effects as the ingredients are without side effects.<br>
Besides being in the form of ointment, the medicament of the invention also may be in the form of a cream. The process of preparing the ointment or cream of the invention is simple, easy and convenient to carry out.<br>
10<br><br>
