				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   a   6-cyclopentyl   4-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro-2h-pyran-2-one compound and a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the Hepatitis virus (HCV) polymerase enzyme, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds methods of using such compounds and formulations in the treatment of HCV-infecter mammals, such as humans, and methods and interrnediates compounds useful In preparing such compounds.<br>
Background The invention relates to agents that inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependen RNA polymerase (RdRp).   The invention also relates to the use of such compounds in pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic treatments useful tor inhibition of HCV replication.<br>
HCV is an enveloped RMA virus containing a single-setranded positive-sense RNA genome approximately 9,5 kb in length (Chco, et al., Science 244:359-362 (1988)). The RNA genome contains a 5'-nontranslated region (5' NTH) of 341 nucleotides (Brown, et al, Nucl. Acids Res. 20:5041-5045 (1992); Bukh, et aL, Proc Natl. Acad Sci USA 89:4342-4946 (1992)), a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single polypeptide of 3,010 to 3,040 amino acids (Choo, et at (1989), supra;), and a 3'-nontrartsiated region (3'-NTR) of variable length of about 230 nucleotides (Kolykhalov, et alâ€ž J. Vlrol. 70:3363-3371 {1996); Tanaka, et<br>
ah, J. Virol 70:3307-3312 (1998)).<br>
The 5' NTR is one of tie most conserved regions of the viral genome and plays a pivoted role in the initiation of translation of the viral polyprotein. A single ORF encodes a poiyprotein that is co- or post-translationally processed into structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS48, NSSA, and NS5B) viral proteins by either cellular or viral proteinases (Bartenschiager (1997), supra).   The 3' NTR consists of three distinct regions: a variable region of about 38 nucleotides following the stop codon of the polyprotein, a polyuridine tract of, variables length with interspersed, substitutions of cystines, and 98 nucleotides (nt) at the very and which are highly conserved among various HCV Isolates. The order of the genes within the genome is: NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH (Grakoul, et al, J. Virol. 67:f 385-1395 (1993)).<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the hepacrvfrus genus in the family Fleviviridae. it is the major causative agent of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis and is the major cause of translusion-associated hepatitis and accounts for a significant proportion of hepatitis cases worldwide. Although acute HCV Infection is often asymptomatic, nearly 80% of cases<br>
resolve to chronic hepatitis. The persistent property of the HCV infection has been explained' by its ability to escape from the host immune surveillance through hypermutability of the exposed regions in the envelope protein E2 (Weiner, et al., Virology 180:842-848 (1991 ); Weiner, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 89:3468-3472 (1992). Processing of the structural proteins core (C), envelope protein 1 and (E1 , E2), and the p7 region is mediated by host signal peptidases. In contrast, maturation of the nonstructural (NS) region is accomplished by two viral enzymes. The HCV polyprotein is first cleaved by a host signal peptidase generating the structural proteins C/E1 , E1/E2, E2/p7, and p7/NS2 (Hijikata, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScI. USA 88:5547-5551 (1991); Lin, et al., J. Virol. 68:5063-5073 (1994)). The NS2-3 proteinase, which is a metalloprotease, then cleaves at the NS2/NS3 junction. The NS3/4A proteinase complex (NS3 serine protease/NS4A cofactor), then at all the remaining cleavage sites (Bartenschlager, et al., J. Virol. 67:3835-3844 (1993); Bartenschlager, (1997), supra). RNA helicase and NTPase activities have also been identified in the NS3 protein. The N-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein functions as a protease, and the remaining two-thirds of the molecule acts as a helicase/ATPase, which is thought to be involved in HCV replication (Bartenschlager, (1997), supra). NS5A may be phosphorylated and act as a putative cofactor of NS5B. The fourth viral enzyme, NS5B, is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a key component responsible for replication of the viral RNA genome (Lohmann, et al., J. Virol. 71 :8416-8428 (1997)). Replication of HCV is thought to occur in membrane-associated replication complexes. Within these, the genomic plus-strand RNA is transcribed into minus-strand RNA, which in turn can be used as a template for synthesis of progeny genomic plus strands. Two viral proteins appear to be involved in this reaction: the NS3 protein, which carries in the carboxy terminal two-thirds a nucleoside triphosphatase/ RNA helicase, and the NS5B protein, which is a membrane-associated phosphoprotein with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) (Hwang, et al., J. Virol. 227:439-446 (1997)). While the role of NS3 in RNA replication is less clear, NS5B apparently is the key enzyme responsible for synthesis of progeny RNA strands. Using recombinant baculoviruses to express NS5B in insect cells and a synthetic nonviral RNA as a substrate, two enzymatic activities have been identified as being associated with NS5B. The two activities include a primer-dependent RdRp and a terminal transferase (TNTase) activity. NS5B's activity was confirmed and further characterized through the use of the HCV RNA genome as a substrate (Lohmann, et al., Virology 249:108-118 {1998)). Recent studies have shown that NS5B with a C-terminal 21 amino-acid truncation expressed in Escherichia coli is also active for in vitro RNA synthesis (Ferrari, et al., J. Virol. 73:1649-1654 (1999); Yamashita, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273:15479- 15486 (1998)).<br><br>
[0013] Since persistent infection of HCV is related to chronic hepatitis and eventually to hepatocarcinogenesis, HCV replication is one of the targets to eliminate HCV reproduction and to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, present treatment approaches for<br><br>
[0014] HCV infection are characterized by relatively poor efficacy and an unfavorable side-effect profile. Therefore, intensive effort is directed at the discovery of molecules to treat this disease, including the discovery of drugs designed to inhibit HC replication, as there is a persistent need for non-peptide, small-molecule compounds that are HCV RdRp inhibitors having desirable or improved physical and chemical properties appropriate for pharmaceutical applications.<br><br>

[0511] As used herein, the term "catalyst" means a chemical element or compound that increases the rate of a chemical reaction by reducing the activation energy, but which is left unchanged by the reaction. Examples of catalysts include, but are not limited to, palladium (0) and platinum (0). It is specifically contemplated herein that such catalysts may be formed in situ during the course of a chemical reaction, from a so-called "pre-catalyst," but may never actually be observed or isolated.

For example, in acid chlorides of the formula CI-C(O)R, wherein R is alky], aryl, or heterocyclic, the -Cl group is generally referred to as a leaving group because it allows nucleophilic substitution reactions to take place at the carbonyl carbon to which it is attached. Suitable leaving groups are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can include halides, aromatic heterocycles, cyano, amino groups (generally under acidic conditions), ammonium groups, alkoxide groups, carbonate groups, formates, and hydroxy groups that have been activated by reaction with compounds such as carbodiimides. For example, suitable leaving groups can include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, cyano, imidazole, and hydroxy groups that have been allowed to react with a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (optionally in the presence of an additive such as hydroxybenzotriazole) or a carbodiimide derivative.

[0517] The term "chiral, non-racemic base," as used herein, means a basic compound that can exist in an enantiomeric form and is not present in an equal amount with its corresponding opposite enantiomer. For example, the compound 2-phenylglycinol exists as two enantiomers of opposite configuration, the so-called (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. If the (R)- and the (S)- enantiomers are present in equal amounts, such a mixture is said to be "racemic." If, however, one enantiomer is present in an amount greater than the other, the mixture is said to be "non-racemic." , The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds that have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of their atoms or groups in space. In particular, the term "enantiomers" refers to two stereoisomers of a compound that are non- superimposable mirror images of one another. The terms "racemic" or "racemic mixture," as used herein, refer to a 1 :1 mixture of enantiomers of a particular compound.

[0518] The term "stereochemically-enriched" product, when used herein, refers to a reaction product wherein a particular stereoisomer is present in a statistically significant greater amount relative to the other possible stereoisomeric products. For example, a product that comprises more of one enantiomer than the other would constitute a stereochemically enriched product. Similarly, a product that comprises more of one diastereoisomer than others would also constitute a stereochemically enriched product. The methods and processes contained herein are said to afford a "stereochemically enriched " product. In such cases, the methods and processes contained herein begin with a mixture of stereoisomeric compounds in which all possible stereoisomers are present in about an equal amount and afford a product in which at least one stereoisomer is present in a statistically significant greater amount than the others.<br><br>
[0519] The term "diastereomeric," as used herein refers to the relationship between a pair of stereoisomers that comprise two or more asymmetric centers and are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. The phrases "diastereomeric salt," or "diastereomeric salts," as used herein means a salt of a diastereomeric compound, wherein "diastereomer" is as defined herein.<br><br>
[0520] The term "racemic," as used herein, means a composition comprising a 1 :1 ratio of enantiomers. The term "scalemic," as used herein, means a composition comprising an unequal amount of enantiomers. For example, a composition comprising a 1 :1 mixture of the B2005/002697<br><br>
[0521] - 66 -<br><br>
[0522] (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of a compound of the present invention is termed a racemic composition or mixture. As an additional example, a composition comprising a 2:1 mixture of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of a compound of the present invention is termed a scalemic composition or mixture. It is specifically contemplated that the methods of the present invention may be advantageously used to prepare a scalemic compound of the present invention from a racemic compound of the present invention.<br><br>
[0523] The terms "resolution" and "resolving" mean a method of physically separating stereoisomeric compounds from a mixture of stereoisomers, such as a racemic mixture comprising two enantiomers of a particular compound. As used herein, "resolution" and "resolving" are meant to include both partial and complete resolution.<br><br>
[0524] The terms "separating" or "separated," as used herein, mean a process of physically isolating at least two different chemical compounds from each other. For example, if a chemical reaction takes place and produces at least two products, (A) and (B), the process of isolating both (A) and (B) from each other is termed "separating" (A) and (B). It is specifically contemplated that the separations of the present invention may be partial or complete as determined by analytical techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art and those described herein.<br><br>
[0525] The term "converting," as used herein, means allowing a chemical reaction to take place with a starting material or materials to produce a different chemical product. For example, if chemical reactants (A) and (B) are allowed to react with each other to produce product (C), starting materials (A) and (B) can be said to have "converted" to product (C), or it can be said that (A) was "converted" to (C), or that (B) was "converted" to (C).<br><br>
[0526] The term "suitable counter-ion," as used herein, means an ion or ions opposite in charge to the ion present in the compound or compounds of the invention such that the overall complex or salt has a neutral charge. For example, if the compound of the present invention contains an overall negative one (-1) charge, a suitable counter ion would be one with an overall positive one (+1) charge that would afford an overall neutral charge for the complex or salt. Examples of suitable positive (+) counter-ions include, but are not limited to, sodium ion (Na), potassium ion (K), cesium ion (Cs), and protonated amines (such as protonated triethylamine, protonated dicyclohexylamine, protonated morpholine, or protonated pyridine). Alternatively, if the compound of the invention contains an overall positive one (+1) charge, a suitable counter-ion would be one with an overall negative one (-1) charge that would afford an overall neutral charge for the complex or salt. Examples of suitable negative (-) counter- ions include, but are not limited to, fluoride (F), chloride (Cl), bromide (Br), iodide (I), hydroxide (OH), and acetate (O-C(O)CH3). It is also possible that the suitable counter-ion in the compounds of the present invention, including the compounds used in the methods of the present invention, may have more than a single charge associated with them. For example, if the compound of the invention contains a negative one (-1) charge, the suitable counter-ion may contain a plus two (+2) charge, such that two compounds of the invention with negative one charges are associated with one suitable counter-ion. Examples, of suitable counter-ions with more than one positive charge include, but are not limited to calcium (Ca). Finally, it is also contemplated that the compounds of the present invention may contain more than one charge, such that more than one suitable counter-ion may be required to afford an overall neutral complex or salt. For example, the compound of the present invention may contain more than one negative one (-1) charges, such that two suitable counter-ions, each with a plus one (+1) charge, are required to afford an overall neutral complex or salt.<br><br>

[0535] The compounds of the present invention may exist in several tautomeric forms. For example, a compound of the invention may exist in a form in which two ketones are present on a ring of the compound, as shown in (A) below. Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may exist in at least two different enol forms, as shown in compounds (B) and (C) below. These three forms may be in equilibrium and the compounds of the invention may exist in more than one of these forms at the same time. For example, in a particular compound of the invention, a certain percentage of the molecules may be present in form (A) while the remainder are present in form (B) or form (C). Which form predominates in a particular compound of the invention depends on several factors that include, but are not limited to, whether the compound is in solid, liquid, or crystalline form, whether the compound is dissolved in a solvent and the identity of the solvent, the environmental temperature, and the relative humidity. It is specifically contemplated that when the compounds of the present invention are drawn in a particular form, form (A) for example, all the tautomeric forms, forms (B) and (C) for example, are included as well.<br><br>

[0537] The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the present invention may be depicted herein using a solid line ( ), a solid wedge ( ~"^<mm> ), or a dotted wedge ( -"""HI ). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of the invention may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of the invention and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present. Solutions of individual stereoisomeric compounds of the present invention may rotate plane-polarized light.

[0538] Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.<br><br>
[0539] Alternatively, individual stereoisomeric compounds of the present invention may be prepared in enantiomerically enriched form by asymmetric synthesis. Asymmetric synthesis may be performed using techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as the use of asymmetric starting materials that are commercially available or readily prepared using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, the use of asymmetric auxiliaries that may be removed at the completion of the synthesis, or the resolution of intermediate compounds using enzymatic methods. The choice of such a method will depend on factors that include, but are not limited to, the availability of starting materials, the relative efficiency of a method, and whether such methods are useful for the compounds of the invention containing particular functional groups. Such choices are within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
[0540] When the compounds of the present invention contain asymmetric carbon atoms, the derivative salts, prodrugs and solvates may exist as single stereoisomers, racemates, and/or mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates, and mixtures thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
[0541] As generally understood by those skilled in the art, an optically pure compound is one that is enantiomerically pure. As used herein, the term "optically pure" is intended to mean a compound comprising at least a sufficient activity. Preferably, an optically pure amount of a single enantiomer to yield a compound having the desired pharmacological pure compound of the invention comprises at least 90% of a single isomer (80% enantiomeric excess), more preferably at least 95% (90% e.e.), even more preferably at least 97.5% (95% e.e.), and most preferably at least 99% (98% e.e.). If a derivative used in the method of the invention is a base, a desired salt may be prepared by any suitable method known to the art, including treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid; hydrobromic acid; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid; and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid; maleic acid; succinic acid; mandelic acid; fumaric acid; malonic acid; pyruvic acid; oxalic acid; glycolic acid; salicylic acid; pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid; alpha-hydroxy acid, such as citric acid .or tartaric acid; amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid; aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid; sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid; and the like.

Illustrative Examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids such as glycine and arginine; ammonia; primary, secondary, and tertiary amines; and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine; as well as inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.<br><br>
[0542] In the case of derivatives, prodrugs, salts, or solvates that are solids, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the derivatives, prodrugs, salts, and solvates used in the method of the invention, may exist in different polymorph or crystal forms, all of which are intended to be within the scope of the present invention and specified formulas. In addition, the derivative, salts, prodrugs and solvates used in the method of the invention may exist as tautomers, all of which are intended to be within the broad scope of the present invention.<br><br>
[0543] The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically, unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back ( to the free base compound by treatment wiwah" alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br><br>
[0544] Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.<br><br>
[0545] The activity of the compounds as inhibitors of HCV activity may be measured by any of the suitable methods available in the art, including in vivo and in vitro assays. An Example of a suitable assay for activity measurements is the HCV replicon assay described herein.<br><br>
[0546] Administration of the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, salts, active metabolites, and solvates may be performed according to any of the accepted modes of administration available to those skilled in the art. Illustrative Examples of suitable modes of administration include oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal, and rectal. Oral and intravenous deliveries are preferred.<br><br>
[0547] An HCV-inhibiting agent of the present invention may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition in any suitable pharmaceutical form. Suitable pharmaceutical forms include solid, semisolid, liquid, or lyopholized formulations, such as tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, suspensions, liposomes, and aerosols. The HCV-inhibiting agent may be prepared as a solution using any of a variety of methodologies. For Example, the HCV-inhibiting agent can be dissolved with acid (e.g., 1 M HCI) and diluted with a sufficient volume of a solution of 5% dextrose in water (D5W) to yield the desired final concentration of HCV-inhibiting agent (e.g., about 15 mM). Alternatively, a solution of D5W containing about 15 mM HCI can be used to provide a solution of the HCV-inhibiting agent at the appropriate concentration. Further, the HCV-inhibiting agent can be prepared as a suspension using, for example, a 1% solution of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC).<br><br>
[0548] Acceptable methods of preparing suitable pharmaceutical forms of the pharmaceutical compositions are known or may be routinely determined by those skilled in the art. For Example, pharmaceutical preparations may be prepared following conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical chemist involving steps such as mixing, granulating, and compressing when necessary for tablet forms, or mixing, filling, and dissolving the ingredients as appropriate, to give the desired products for oral, parenteral, topical, intravaginal, intranasal, intrabronchial, intraocular, intraaural, and/or rectal administration. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also include suitable excipients, diluents, vehicles, and carriers, as well as other pharmaceutically active agents, depending upon the intended use. Solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, vehicles, or excipients may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions. Illustrative solid carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Illustrative liquid carriers include syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, saline solution, and water. The carrier or diluent may include a suitable prolonged-release material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or with a wax. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid (e.g., solution), or a nonaqueous or aqueous liquid suspension.<br><br>
[0549] A dose of the pharmaceutical composition may contain at least a therapeutically effective amount of an HCV-inhibiting agent and preferably is made up of one or more pharmaceutical dosage units. The selected dose may be administered to a mammal, for example, a human, in need of treatment mediated by inhibition of HCV activity, by any known or suitable method of administering the dose, including topically, for example, as an ointment or cream; orally; rectally, for example, as a suppository; parenterally by injection; intravenously; or continuously by intravaginal, intranasal, intrabronchial, intraaural, or intraocular infusion. When the composition is administered in conjunction with a cytotoxic drug, the composition can be administered before, with, and/or after introduction of the cytotoxic drug. However, when the composition is administered in conjunction with radiotherapy, the composition is preferably introduced before radiotherapy is commenced.<br><br>
[0550] Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15<th> Ed. (1975). It will be appreciated that the actual dosages of the HCV-inhibiting agents used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be selected according to the properties of the particular agent being used, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration and the particular site, and the host and condition being treated.

The reaction of compounds of formula (9), (9a), or suitably activated derivatives thereof, with a reagent or combination or reagents to afford a compound of formula (25) may require the introduction of a suitable protecting group for the tertiary hydroxyl group in the compounds of formula (9). Such protecting groups should be capable of being introduced into the compound of formula (9) under conditions that will selectively protect such hydroxyl group. Such reagents and conditions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be found, for example, in T. Greene and P.

For example, a silyl protecting group, such as a triisopropyl silyl group, can be introduced into the compound of formula (9) to selectively protect the tertiary hydroxy] group. Such a group can be introduced using an activated silane reagent, such as triisopropyl silyl chloride for example, in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine for example, and in an aprotic solvent, chloroform for example. The protected compound of formula (9) may then be allowed to react as .described above to afford a compound of formula (25) in protected form. The protected compound (25) can then be deprotected using conditions known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, if the tertiary hydroxyl group in the compound of formula (25) is protected with as a silyl ether, for example, it can be deprotected using a fluoride source, tetrabutylammonium fluoride for example, in a solvent such as THF and at a temperature in the range of from about 0 C to about 100 C1 or in the range of from about 0 C to about 25 C.
