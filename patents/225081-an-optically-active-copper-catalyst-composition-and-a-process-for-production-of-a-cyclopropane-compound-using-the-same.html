Examples of the diazoacetic acid ester (3) include, for example, methyl diazoacetate, ethyl diazoacetate, n-propyl<br><br>
diazoacetate, isopropyl diazoacetate, n-butyl diazoacetate, isobutyl diazoacetate and tert-butyl diazoacetate.<br>
The amount of the olefin (2) to be used is usually 1 mole or more, preferably 1.2 moles or more relative to 1 mole of the diazoacetic acid ester (3).  There is no specific upper limit and when the olefin (2) is a liquid, large excess thereof can be used also to serve as the solvent.<br>
As the optically active copper complex composition, the either composition having ligand of (R)-isomer or (S)-isomer may be used as described above and a mixture thereof in which one of them exists in excess than the other may be used.  The amount of the optically active copper complex to be used is usually about 0.0001 to 0.05 mole, preferably about 0.0005 to 0.01 mole in terms of the copper metal relative to 1 mole of the diazoacetic acid ester (3).<br>
The reaction of the olefin (2) and the diazoacetic acid ester (3) is usually carried out by mixing three components, the optically active copper catalyst composition, the olefin (2), and the diazoacetic acid ester (3), in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon gas or nitrogen gas.  The mixing order is not particularly limited. Usually, the diazoacetic acid ester (3) is added to a mixture of the optically active copper catalyst composition and the olefin (2).  When the divalent copper compound is used for preparing the optically active copper catalyst<br><br>
composition, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as phenylhydrazine.<br>
The reaction of the olefin (2) and diazoacetic acid ester (3) is usually carried out in the presence of a solvent. Examples of the solvent include, for example, halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride; aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane and cyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene and xylene; and ester solvent such as ethyl acetate. The solvent can be used alone or in the form of a mixture. Although the amount of the solvent to be used is not particularly limited, in view of the volume efficiency and the properties of the reaction mixture, the amount of the solvent to be used is usually about 2 to 30 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 20 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the diazoacetic acid ester (3).  The solvent can be mixed previously with the olefin (2), the diazoacetic acid ester (3), and/or the optically active copper catalyst composition.  Alternatively, as described above, when the olefin (2) is a liquid, the olefin (2) can also be used as the solvent.<br>
Since the copper catalyst composition of the present invention has a superior catalytic activity at low temperature, the reaction can be carried out at lower<br><br>
reaction temperature than ever before.  The reaction temperature is usually about -50 to 50°C, preferably -20 to 30°C.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the optically active cyclopropane compound (4) can be isolated by, for example, concentrating the reaction mixture.

Examples<br>

detail by Examples.  The present invention is not limited to these Examples.  The yield of the optically active cyclopropane compound, the trans-isomer/cis-isomer ratio and the residual ratio of diazoacetic acid ester were calculated from results of gas chromatography.<br>
The optically purity of the optically active cyclopropane compound was calculated from results of liquid chromatography analysis.  A trans-isomer means the compound having the ester group at 1-position and the 2-methyl-l-propenyl group at 3-position on the opposite side with respect to the cyclopropane ring plane and a cis-isomer means the compound having the ester group at 1-position and the 2-methyl-1-propenyl group at 3-position on the same side with respect to the cyclopropane ring plane.<br>

According to the same manner as that described in Example 8, optically active ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate was obtained in a yield of 86% and the trans-isomer/cis-isomer ratio = 58/42 except that 0.53 mg of lithium hydroxide was used in place of 3.57 mg of triethoxyaluminum.  The residual ratio of ethyl diazoacetate was 0.1%.  Optical purity of the trans-isomer was 81%e.e. and that of the cis-isomer was 75%e.e.<br><br>
Example 15<br>
According to the same manner as that described in Example 8, optically active ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate was obtained in a yield of 82% and the trans-isomer/cis-isomer ratio = 58/42 except that 0.57 mg of lithium fluoride was used in place of 3.57 mg of triethoxyaluminum.  The residual ratio of ethyl diazoacetate was 0.1%.  Optical purity of the trans-isomer was 81%e.e. and that of the cis-isomer was 76%e.e.<br>
