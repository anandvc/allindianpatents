				<td>The invention relates to substituted azaquinazolines and methods for their preparaÂ¬tion, and to their use for the production of medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for use as antiviral agents, in particular against cytomegaloviruses.<br>
The synthesis of dihydroquinazolines is described in Saito T., et al. Tetrahedron Lett, 1996, 37, 209-212 and in Wang F., et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 1997, 38, 8651-8654.<br>
Although agents having antiviral activity and different structures are available on the market, the therapies currently available with Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, Foscarnet and Cidofovir are associated with severe side effects, e.g. nephrotoxicity, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. It is moreover regularly possible for a resistance to develop. Novel agents for effective therapy are therefore desirable.<br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel compounds with identical or improved antiviral activity for the treatment of viral infectious diseases in humans and animals. <br>
It has surprisingly been found that the substituted azaquinazolines described in the present invention have antiviral activity.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of the formula<br><br>

Suitable active ingredients in the combination which may be mentioned by way of example and preferably are: antiviral active ingredients such as Gancyclovir or Acyclovir.<br>
The compounds of the invention may have systemic and/or local effects. They can for this purpose be administered in a suitable way, such as, for example, by the oral, parenteral, pulmonary, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctiva!, otic or topical route, or as implant or stent.<br>
For these administration routes the compounds of the invention can be administered in suitable administration forms.<br>
Suitable for oral administration are administration forms which function according to the prior art and deliver the compounds of the invention rapidly and/or in modified manner and which comprise the compounds of the invention in crystalline and/or amorphicized and/or dissolved form, such as, for example, tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with coatings which are resistant to gastric juice or dissolve with a delay or are insoluble and control the release of the compound of the invention), tablets or films/wafers which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films/Iyophilisates, capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.<br><br>
Parenteral administration can take place with avoidance of an absorption step (e.g. intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, Intraspinal or intralumbar) or with inclusion of an absorption (e.g. intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, percutaneous, or intraperitoneal). Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration are, inter alia, preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophiJisates or sterile powders.<br>
Examples suitable for the other administration routes are pharmaceutical forms for inhalation (inter alia powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions, sprays; tablets, films/wafers or capsules, to be administered lingually, sublingually or buc-cally, suppositories, preparations for the eyes and ears, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems, milk, pastes, foams, dusting powders, implants or stents.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be converted into the listed administration forms. This can take place in a manner known per se by mixing with inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These include, inter alia, carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (for example liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and clispersants or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyr-rolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (for example antioxidants such as ascorbic acid), colours (for example inorganic pigments such as iron oxides) or flavour- and/or odour corrigents.<br>
The present invention further relates to medicaments which comprise at least one compound of the invention, usually together with one or more inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients, and to the use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.<br><br>
It has generally proved advantageous to administer on intravenous administration amounts of about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably about 0,01 to 5 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results, and the dosage on oral administration is about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the amounts mentioned, specifically as a function of the body weight, administration route, individual response to the active ingredient, mode of preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. It may in the event of an administration of larger amounts be advisable to divide these into a plurality of individual doses over the day.<br>
The percentage data in the following tests and examples are percentages by weight unless otherwise indicated; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios and concentration data of liquid/liquid solutions are in each case based on volume.<br><br>

B.        Assessment of the physiological activity<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following assays:<br>
Anti-HCMV (anti-human cytomegalovirus) cytopathogenicity tests<br>
The test compounds are employed as 50 millimolar (mM) solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). GanciclovirÂ®, FoscarnetÂ® and CidofovirÂ® are used as reference compounds. After addition of 2 ul each of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM DMSO stock solutions to 98 pi portions of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H for duplicate determinations, 1:2 dilutions are carried out with 50 |al portions of medium up to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contain 50 ul of medium. 150 ]4l of a suspension of 1 x 104 cells (human prepuce flbroblasts [NHDF]) are then pipetted into each of the wells (row 1 = cell control) and, in rows 2-12, a mixture of HCMV-infected and uninfected NHDF cells (M.O.I. = 0.001 - 0.002), i.e. 1-2 infected ceils per 1000 uninfected cells. Row 12 (without substance) serves as virus control. The final test concentrations are 250-0.0005 uM. The plates are incubated at 37Â°C/5% CO2 for 6 days, i.e. until all the cells are infected in the virus controls (100% cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells are then fixed and stained by adding a mixture of formalin and Giemsa's dye (30 minutes), washed with double-distilled water and dried in a drying oven at 50Â°C. The plates are then assessed visually using an overhead microscope (plaque multiplier from Technomara),<br>
The following data can be acquired from the test plates:<br>
CCso (NHDF) = substance concentration in pM at which no visible cytostatic effects on the cells are evident by comparison with the untreated cell control;<br>
EC5o (HCMV) = substance concentration in pM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic effect) by 50% compared with the untreated virus control;<br><br>
SI (selectivity index) = CCso (NHD!3) / ECso (HCMV).<br>
Representative in vitro data for the effects of the compounds of the invention are shown in Table A:<br>

The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of HCMV infections can be shown in the following animal model:<br>
HCMV Xenograft Gelfoam18 model<br>
Animals:<br>
3-4-week old female immunodeficient mice (16-18 g), Fox Chase SCID or Fox Chase SCID-NOD or SCID beige, are purchased from commercial breeders (Taconic M+B, Jackson, USA). The animals are housed under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed) in isolators.<br><br>
Virus growing:<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Davis or AD169 strain, is grown in vitro on human embryonic prepuce fibroblasts (NHDF cells). After the NHDF cells have been infected with a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.01-0.03, the virus-infected ceils are harvested 5-10 days later and stored in the presence of minimal essential medium (MEM), 10% foetal calf serum (PCS) with 10% DMSO at -40Â°C. After serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus-infected cells, the titer is determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells after vital staining with neutral red.<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaiuation:<br>
Collagen sponges Ixlxl cm in size (GelfoamÂ®; from Peasel &amp; Lorey, order No, 407534; K.T. Chong et al,, Abstracts of 39lh Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the trapped air bubbles are removed by degassing, and then stored in MEM + 10% PCS. 1 x IO6 virus-infected NHDF cells (infection with HCMV Davis or HCMV AD169 M.O.I. = 0.03) are detached 3 hours after infection and added dropwise in 20 ul of MEM, 10% PCS, to a moist sponge. About 16 hours later, the sponges loaded with infected cells are incubated with 25 ul of PBS / 0.1% BSA / 1 mM DTT with 5 ng/ul basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). For the transplantation, the immunodeficient mice are anesthetized with Avertin or a ketamine/xylazine/aze-promazinc mixture, the fur on the back is removed using a shaver, the epidermis is opened 1-2 cm, unstressed arid the moist sponges are transplanted under the dorsal skin. The surgical wound is closed with tissue glue. 6 hours after the transplantation, the mice can be treated for the first time (one treatment is given on the day of the operation). On subsequent days, oral treatment with the substance is carried out three times a day (7.00 h and 14.00 h and 19.00 h), twice a day (8 h and 18 h) or once a day (14 h) over a period of 8 days. The daily dose is for example 3 or 10 or 30 or 60 or 100 mg/kg of body weight, the volume administered is 10 ml/kg of body weight. The substances are formulated in the form of a 0.5% strength Xylose suspen-<br><br>
sion with 2% DMSO or a 0.5% strength Tylose suspension, 9 days after transplantation and 16 hours after the last administration of substance, the animals are painlessly sacrificed and the sponge is removed, The virus-infected cells are released from the sponge by collagenase digestion (330 U/1.5 ml) and stored in the presence of MEM, 10% foetal calf serum, 10% DMSO at -140Â°C. Evaluation takes place after serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus-infected cells by determining the titer on 24-weIl plates of confluent NHDF cells after vital staining with neutral red. The number of infected cells or infectious virus particles (infectious center assay) after the substance treatment compared with the placebo-treated control group is determined.<br>
GYP inhibition assay<br>
To investigate the mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibition of CYP3A4, the test substance is incubated in various concentrations with human liver microsomes (2mg/ml microsomal protein) in a potassium phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 with the addition of NADPH-generating system (NADP*, glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) at 37Â°C. 2 aliquots are taken from the incubation at various times.<br>
The first aliquot is incubated 1:50 in a new incubation solution (phosphate buffer, NADPH-generating system and 10 uM midazolam) at 37Â°C for a further 10 min, The incubation is then stopped with acetonitrile on ice, the protein is pelleted in a centrifuge at 15 000 g, and the supernatant is analysed by HPLC/MS according to standard methods offer the formation of l'-hydroxymidazolam.<br>
The second aliquot is stopped with acetonitrile on ice and analysed by HPLC/UV/MS for remaining test substance.<br>
Parameters typical of irreversible inhibition (kiraci, Ki and partition ratio r) are determined from the two analytical data sets, and the test substance is assessed therewith (cf. A. Madan, et al., in A.D. Rodrigues (ed.) "Drug-Drug Interaction" in "Drugs and<br><br>
