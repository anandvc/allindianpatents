				<td>FIBER OPTIC SPLITTER MODULE<br>
Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to fiber optic<br>
telecommunications equipment. More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
fiber optic modules and chassis for holding fiber optic modules.<br>
Background<br>
In fiber optic telecommunications systems, it is common for optical<br>
fibers of transmission cables to be split into multiple strands, either by optical<br>
splitting of a signal carried by a single stranded cable or by fanning out the<br>
individual fibers of a multi-strand cable. Further, when such systems are installed, it<br>
is known to provide excess capacity in the installations to support future growth and<br>
utilization of the fibers. Often in these installations, modules including splitters or<br>
fanouts are used to provide the connection between transmission fibers and customer<br>
fibers. To reduce the cost and complexity of the initial installation and still provide<br>
options for future expansion, a module mounting chassis capable of mounting<br>
multiple modules may be used in such an installation.<br>
While the chassis may accept several modules, the initial installation<br>
may only include fewer modules mounted in the chassis, or enough to serve current<br>
needs. These chassis may be configured with limited access to one or more sides, or<br>
may be mounted in cramped locations. In addition, some of these chassis may be<br>
pre -configured with the maximum capacity of transmission cables to accommodate<br>
and link to modules which may be installed in the future. Since it is desirable to<br>
have access to components within the chassis for cleaning during the installation of a<br>
new module, some provision or feature of the chassis will desirably permit a user to<br>
access and clean the connectors of these pre-conneclorized and pre-installed<br>
transmission cables.<br>
It is also desirable for the chassis to be configured to ensure that<br>
modules are installed correctly and aligned with other components within the chassis<br>
to mate with the pre-connectorized and pre-installed transmission cables.<br>
 <br>
Summary<br>
The present invention relates to a telecommunications assembly<br>
including a chassis and a plurality of modules mounted within the chassis. The<br>
modules include one or more fiber optic connectors. Within an interior of the<br>
chassis at each mounting location are positioned corresponding fiber optic adapters.<br>
Inserting the module through a front opening of the chassis at a mounting location<br>
positions the one or more connectors of the module for insertion into and mating<br>
with the adapters of the chassis. The adapters within the interior of the chassis are<br>
integrally formed within a removable adapter assembly.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of mounting a<br>
telecommunications module within a chassis.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the<br>
present invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer<br>
to the same or similar parts.<br>
FIGS. 1-7 illustrate a telecommunications assembly 10 that includes a<br>
telecommunications chassis 12 and a plurality of fiber optic splitter modules 14<br>
adapted to be mounted within chassis 12. Fiber optic splitter modules 14 are<br>
configured to be slidably inserted within chassis 12 and be optically coupled to<br>
adapter assemblies 16 mounted within chassis 12. Adapter assemblies 16 mounted .<br>
within chassis 12 form connection locations between connectors terminated to an<br>
incoming fiber optic cable and connectors of splitter modules 14 as will be discussed<br>
in further detail below.<br>
Still referring to FIGS. 1-7, chassis 12 includes a top wall 18 and a<br>
bottom wall 20 extending between a pair of opposing transverse sidewalls, 22, 24.<br>
Chassis 12 includes an opening 26 through a rear side 28 of chassis 12 and an<br>
opening 30 through a front side 32 of chassis 12. Fiber optic splitter modules 14 are<br>
inserted into chassis 12 through front opening 30. Adapter assemblies 16 are<br>
inserted through and mounted adjacent rear opening 26 of chassis 12. Sidewalls 22,<br>
24, each include a cut-out 34 extending from front opening 30 toward rear side 28.<br>
Splitter modules 14 mounted within chassis 12 are visible through cut-out 34.<br>
Sidewalls 22, 24 of chassis 12 also define an inset portion 36 at rear side 28 of<br>
chassis 12 to facilitate access to adapter assemblies 16.<br>
 <br>
In FIG. 1, chassis 12 is shown with eight fiber optic splitter modules<br>
14 mounted thereon. It should be noted that in other embodiments, the chassis may<br>
be sized to hold a larger or a smaller number of splitter modules.<br>
Still referring to FIGS. 1-7, chassis 12 includes a plurality of<br>
mounting locations 38 for slidably receiving splitter modules 14. Each mounting<br>
location 38 defines a slot 40 adjacent top wall 18 and a slot 42 adjacent bottom wall<br>
20 of chassis 12. Slots 42 adjacent bottom wall 20 are visible in FIG. 1. Slots 40<br>
adjacent top wall 18 are illustrated in FIGS. 36 and 37. Slots 40, 42 extend from<br>
front 32 of chassis 12 to rear 28 of chassis 12. Slots 40, 42 are configured to receive<br>
mounting flanges 44, 46 of splitter modules 14 as shown in FIGS. 36 and 37 to align<br>
modules 14 with other components within chassis 12 (e.g., adapters of the adapter<br>
assemblies) to mate with pre-connectorized and/or pre-installed transmission cables.<br>
Slots 40 defined underneath top wall 18 of chassis 12 are deeper than<br>
slots 42 defined at bottom wall 20 of chassis 12. The depth of slots 40, 42 are<br>
configured to accommodate the different sized flanges 44, 46 that are defined at top<br>
and bottom walls of splitter modules 14. In this manner, slots 40, 42 and mounting<br>
flanges 44, 46 of fiber optic splitter modules 14 provide a keying system to ensure<br>
that modules 14 are inserted into chassis 12 in the correct orientation.<br>
Slots 40 underneath top wall 18 of chassis 12 are defined between a<br>
plurality of bulkheads 48 (please sec FIGS. 36 and 37). Bulkheads 48 extend from<br>
front 32 of chassis 12 to rear 28 of chassis 12. At front end 32 of chassis 12, each<br>
bulkhead 48 defines a downwardly extending front lip 50 (FIG. 35) which interlocks<br>
with a resiliently deformable latch 52 (e.g., cantilever ami) of splitter module 14 to<br>
hold splitter module 14 in place within chassis 12, as will be discussed in further<br>
detail below.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 7, at rear end 28 of chassis 12, each<br>
bulkhead 48 defines a rear face 54 with a fastener hole 56 for receiving a fastener 58<br>
(e.g., a thumbscrew) of an adapter assembly 16 for mounting adapter assembly 16 to<br>
chassis 12. In the embodiment shown, fastener hole 56 is threaded to receive a<br>
screw-type fastener. It shouid be noted that in other embodiments, other types of<br>
fastening structures may be used to mount adapter assembly 16 to rear 28 of chassis<br>
12.<br>
 <br>
Adjacent rear end 28, each bulkhead 48 also includes a horizontal slot<br>
60 and a vertical slot 62 that complement the shape of adapter assembly 16 to<br>
slidably receive adapter assembly 16.<br>
FIGS. 8-15 illustrate adapter assembly 16 according to the invention.<br>
Adapter assemblies 16 form connection locations between the connectors terminated<br>
to an incoming fiber optic cable and the connectors of splitter modules 14 mounted<br>
within chassis 12.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8-15, adapter assembly 16 includes two integrated<br>
adapters 64 formed as a part of a unitary housing 66. In other embodiments, other<br>
number of adapters are also possible. Each adapter 64 of adapter assembly 16<br>
includes a front end 68 and a rear end 70. Front end 68 of each adapter 64 receives a<br>
connector of fiber optic splitter module 14 and rear end 70 receives a connector<br>
terminated to an incoming fiber optic cable.<br>
Adapter assembly housing 66 includes a chassis-mounting slide 72<br>
extending from a top 74 of housing 66, which is received within chassis 12 through<br>
rear end 28. Slide 72 defines a horizontal portion 76 and a vertical portion 78.<br>
Horizontal portion 76 is configured to be slidably received within horizontal slot 60<br>
of bulkhead 48 and vertical portion 78 is configured to be slidably received within<br>
vertical slot 62 of bulkhead 48.<br>
Chassis-mounting slide 72 includes a pair of flanges 80 for<br>
supporting a fastener 58 for securing adapter assembly 16 to chassis 12. As<br>
discussed earlier, fastener 58 is positioned within an opening 56 defined by rear face<br>
54 of bulkheads 48 located underneath top wall 18 of chassis 12. Fastener 58 is<br>
preferably a captive fastener. In the embodiment of the adapter assembly shown in<br>
the FIGS., fastener 58 is a thumbscrew. In other embodiments, other types of<br>
fasteners may be used.<br>
Fastener 58 is rotated to threadingly couple the adapter assembly 16<br>
to the bulkheads 48. Fastener 58 is also configured such that it is able to provide<br>
adapter assembly 16 with a predetermined amount of horizontal float relative to the<br>
chassis 12 once mounted thereon. As illustrated in FIGS. 8-14, the fastener 58 of .<br>
the adapter assembly 16 includes a flange 81. The fastener 58 is able to move<br>
horizontally within the flanges 80 relative to the adapter assembly housing 66. As<br>
shown in FIG. 35, once mounted to the chassis 12, the adapter assembly housing 66<br>
is able to float or move horizontally with respect to the fastener 58 between flange<br>
 <br>
81 and the rear face of the bulkhead 48. For example, in FIG. 35, adapter assembly<br>
16 is shown to be able to move or float a distance of A toward the rear end of chassis<br>
12. In this manner, when a splitter module 14 is slidably pulled out of chassis 12<br>
during disengagement, adapter assembly 16 is able to horizontally float a distance A<br>
towards splitter module 14 as the engaged connector 118 of splitter module 14 pulls<br>
on adapter 64 of adapter assembly 16. In this manner, adapter assembly 16 is<br>
provided with a certain amount of horizontal float when being engaged to and<br>
disengaged from splitter module 14.<br>
As shown in an exploded view of adapter assembly 16 in FIG. 38,<br>
elements of each adapter 64 are positioned through a side opening 82 into adapter<br>
recesses 84 formed within the adapter assembly housing 66. The elements for each<br>
adapter 64 include a ferrule alignment sleeve 86 and a pair of inner housing halves<br>
88. These elements are placed within recesses 84 in manner similar to that shown in<br>
commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 5,317,663, issued May 20, 1993, entitled ONE-<br>
PIECE SC ADAPTER, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A panel 90 closes opening 82 and secures the elements within each adapter 64.<br>
Adapters 64 shown are for SC style connectors, although other types, styles and<br>
formats of adapters may be used within the scope of the present disclosure and<br>
connectors to mate with these alternative adapters.<br>
In FIGS. 16-19, adapter assembly 16 is shown mounted to a fiber<br>
optic splitter module 14, outside of chassis 12.<br>
FIGS. 20-30 illustrate one of the fiber optic splitter modules 14<br>
according to the invention. Referring to FIGS. 20-30, the fiber optic splitter module<br>
14 includes a splitter module housing 92. Splitter module housing 92 includes a<br>
main housing portion 94 and a removable cover 96. Main housing portion 94<br>
includes a first transverse sidewall 98 extending between a top wall 100, a bottom<br>
wall 102, a rear wall 104, and a front wall 106. Removable cover 96 defines a<br>
second transverse wall 108 of splitter module housing 92 and closes off the open<br>
side of module main housing 94.<br>
Cover 96 is mounted to main housing portion 94 by fasteners (not<br>
shown) through fastener mounts 110 defined on main housing portion 94. Cover 96<br>
extends beyond first transverse sidewall 98 to form a top mounting flange 44 and a<br>
bottom mounting flange 46 of splitter module 14. Referring to FIGS. 23, 25, and 26,<br>
as discussed previously, bottom flange 46 of splitter module housing 92 and the<br>
 <br>
corresponding slot 42 on chassis 12 are smaller in size than top flange 44 and the<br>
corresponding top slot 40 on chassis 12. Bottom slot 42 is sized so that, while<br>
bottom flange 46 may be received within slot 42, the larger top flange 44 will not fit.<br>
This ensures that modules 14 are positioned within front opening 30 in a particular<br>
desired orientation. Similar flanges are described in commonly-owned U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,363,465, issued November 8, 1994, entitled FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR<br>
MODULE, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In this<br>
manner, fiber optic modules 14 are oriented correctly to be coupled to adapter<br>
assemblies 16 mounted adjacent rear 28 of chassis 12 at each mounting location 38.<br>
Rear wall 104 of main housing portion 94 includes a curved portion<br>
112 configured to provide bend radius protection to cables within interior 114. Rear<br>
wall 104 of main housing 92 also includes an inset portion 116. A pair of fiber optic<br>
connectors 118 positioned at inset portion 116 protrude rearwardly from rear wall<br>
104 formating with fiber optic adapters 64 of adapter assemblies 16 mounted within<br>
chassis 12.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, front wall 106 of module main housing<br>
94 is angled with regard to front opening 30 of chassis 12, which may aid in the<br>
direction of cables exiting module 14 toward a desired location. In other<br>
embodiments, front walls 106 could be made generally parallel to front 32 of chassis<br>
12 within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
Each module 14 includes two cable exits 120 extending from front<br>
wall 106 of module main housing 94. As shown in FIG. 22, cable exits 120 are<br>
slidably mounted to main housing 94 of module 14 and captured by cover 96 of<br>
module 14 when cover 96 is mounted to main housing 94. Cable exits 120 define a<br>
protruding rear lip 122 that is slidably inserted into slots 124 defined around front<br>
apertures 126 for accommodating cable exits 120. Cover 96 also includes slits 128<br>
that receive rear lips 122 of the cable exits 120 to capture cable exits 120. Cable<br>
exits 120 permit telecommunications cables within module 14 to be directed outside<br>
of module 14. Cable exits 120 are preferably sized thin enough to fit within the<br>
profile of the fiber optic splitter module 14, as shown in FIG. 25, to preserve the<br>
density of the telecommunications assembly 10.<br>
Main housing 94 includes an integrally formed flexible latch 52 (i.e.,<br>
cantilever arm) that is adapted to engage a portion of chassis 12 to hold module 14<br>
 <br>
within front opening 30 of chassis 12. Flexible latch 52 also deflects to permit<br>
withdrawal of module 14 from chassis 12.<br>
Still referring to FIGS. 20-30, latch 52 of module 14 includes a finger<br>
grip tab 130, a front latching tab 132 and a rear latching tab 134. Front latching tab<br>
132 and rear latching tab 134 define a recess 136 thereinbetween. Rear latching tab<br>
134 includes a ramped face 138 that causes latch 52 to elastically deflect down when<br>
module 14 is being inserted into chassis 12. Rear latching tab 134 also includes a<br>
square face 140 that opposes a square face 142 of front latching tab 132.<br>
Front lip 50 of bulkhead 48 at mounting location 38 of chassis 12 is<br>
captured in recess 136 between the two latching tabs 132, 134 to hold module 14 in<br>
place within chassis 12. During insertion, as front lip 50 of bulkhead 48 clears<br>
ramped rear tab 134 and is captured in recess 136 between the two latching tabs 132,<br>
134, latch 52 flexes back upwardly. Recess 136 between the two tabs 132, 134 of<br>
latch 52 allows for a certain amount of horizontal float for splitter module 14 within<br>
chassis 12, as will be discussed in further detail below.<br>
The removal of module 14 from chassis 12 is performed by pressing<br>
latch 52 downwardly to clear the square face 140 of rear tab 134 from lip 50 and<br>
sliding module 14 away from chassis 12. Module 14 includes a fixed grip tab 144<br>
opposing and adjacent to flexible latch 52 to aid removal of module 14 from chassis<br>
12. Fixed grip tab 144 is formed as a part of front wall 106 of module 14. Fixed<br>
grip tab 144 is preferably positioned on module 14 opposite latch 52 so that a user<br>
may apply opposing force on latch 52 and fixed grip tab 144 to securely grasp<br>
module 14 and remove it from chassis 12. Fixed grip tab 144 is preferably<br>
positioned on modulo 14 close enough to latch 52 so that a user may be apply the<br>
force with two adjacent fingers of the hand.<br>
FIG. 22 shows an exploded view of fiber optic splitter module 14<br>
illustrating the internal components of module 14. Fiber optic splitter module 14 is<br>
shown in FIG. 22 with adapter assembly 16 exploded from module 14.<br>
Within interior 114 of main housing 94, splitter module 14 includes a<br>
first radius limiler 146 adjacent curved portion 122 of rear wall 104 of main housing<br>
94. Splitter module 14 includes a second radius limiter 148 adjacent front wall 106<br>
of housing 94 near cable exits 120. Connectors 1 18 of splitter module 14 are<br>
slidably inserted into opposing slots 154 formed in apertures 156 at the rear wall<br>
104. Connectors 118 project out from rear wall 104 at inset portion 116 of rear wall<br>
 <br>
104. Outer housings 150 of connectors 11S include transverse flanges 152 that are<br>
received within the opposing slots 154 formed in apertures 156 that accommodate<br>
the connectors 118. Once slidably inserted, connectors 118 are captured within<br>
housing 92 by cover 96.<br>
Adjacent bottom wall 102 of main housing 94 within interior 114 is<br>
an optical component 158 such as a fiber optic splitter or a fan-out. Optical<br>
component 158 is held against the interior of bottom wall 102 by a clamp 160 (i.e.,<br>
bracket). Clamp 160 is mounted to a clamp mount 162 defined on splitter module<br>
main housing 94 with fasteners (not shown). In the embodiment of the housing 94<br>
shown in the FIGS., clamp mount 162 includes two pairs of mounting holes 164,<br>
166. Either the upper set of holes 164 or the lower set of holes 166 are utilized<br>
depending upon the size of the clamp that will be used to hold optical component<br>
158 against bottom wall 102. It should be noted that different optical components<br>
may have different thicknesses and may require the use of different sized clamps for<br>
holding the optical components in place. In certain embodiments, two optical<br>
components that are stacked on top of another may be used, in which case, a smaller<br>
clamp would be used to hold the two optical components in place.<br>
Optical component 158 is offset from the interior side of first<br>
transverse sidewall 98 by a set of cable management structures 168. In the<br>
embodiment of the module 14 illustrated, the set of cable management structures<br>
168 are elongate structures 170 defining cable management slits 172 therein<br>
between. When optical component 158 is held in place, cables can be routed<br>
through slits 172 between optical component 158 and the interior of first transverse<br>
wall 98 (please sec FIGS. 29 and 30).<br>
Splitter module main housing 94 also includes integrally formed<br>
crimp holders 174 (e.g., slots) adjacent front wall 106 of housing 94 underneath<br>
second radius limiter 148. Crimp elements 176 crimped to the ends of cables that<br>
are split by optical component 158 are slidably received into crimp holders 174 as<br>
shown in FIGS. 22 and 29. Crimp elements 176 define square flanges 175 between<br>
which is defined a recessed portion 177. The crimp holders 174 include<br>
complementary structure to the crimp elements such that once the crimp elements<br>
176 are slidably inserted into the crimp holders 174, the crimp elements 176 are<br>
prevented from moving in a longitudinal direction due to the flanges 175. Once<br>
slidably inserted, crimp elements 176 are held in place by cover 96 that is mounted<br>
 <br>
to splitter module main housing 94. In the embodiment shown, there are nine crimp<br>
holding slots 174, each one being able to accommodate up to four crimp elements<br>
176. Other numbers are possible. Other complementary shapes between the crimp<br>
elements and the crimp holding slots are also possible to provide a slidable fit and to<br>
prevent axial movement of the crimp elements once inserted therein the crimp<br>
holders.<br>
FIG. 29 shows fiberoptic splitter module 14 without a cover 96<br>
exposing the interior features of fiber optic splitter module 14 including routing of a<br>
fiber optic cable within fiber optic splitter module 14. FIG. 30 illustrates a cross-<br>
sectional view taken along section line 30-30 of FIG 29.<br>
As shown in FIG. 29, a first cable 178 extends from connector 118<br>
toward optical component 158, mounted within module housing 92. Optical<br>
component 158, as previously discussed, may be a splitter or a fan-out or another<br>
type of optical component. In the embodiment shown, optical component 158 is a<br>
fiber optic splitter that splits the signal of a single strand to a plurality of secondary<br>
signals. In another embodiment, first cable 178 may be a multi-strand fiber cable<br>
with a plurality of strands of optical fiber and optical component may be a fanout to<br>
separate the individual strands into each of a plurality of second cables.<br>
First cable 178, as it extends toward optical component 158, is<br>
inserted through slits 172 (see FIGS. 22, 29, and 30) located between optical<br>
component 158 and the inner side of first transverse sidewall 98 'of module housing<br>
94 and looped around first radius limiter 146 and then around second radius limiter<br>
148 before being received by optical component 158. Second cables 180 extend<br>
from optical component \5S and are looped again all the way around first radius<br>
limiter 146 before heading toward crimp holders 174. From crimp holders 174,<br>
cables (not shown) crimped lo the other ends of the crimps 176 exit the module<br>
through module exits 120.<br>
An outside cable (not shown) may extend to rear end 70 of an adapter<br>
64 of adapter assembly 16 and be terminated by a connector (not shown in FIG. 29)<br>
that is optically connected to connector 118 of module 14 through adapter 64 once<br>
module 14 is inserted within chassis 12. It should be noted that the routing of the<br>
fiber optic cables within module 14 as shown in FIGS. 29 and 30 is only one<br>
example and other ways of routing the cables within the module are possible.<br>
 <br>
The embodiment of the fiber optic splitter module 14 shown in the<br>
FIGS. is configured such that it can accommodate reduced bend radius fiber. A<br>
reduced bend-radius fiber may have a bend radius of about 15 mm whereas a non-<br>
reduced bend-radius fiber may have a bend radius of about 30 mm.<br>
Similar fiber optic splitter modules are described in commonly-<br>
owned U.S. Patent Application Ser. Nos. 10/980,978 (filed November 3, 2004,<br>
entitled FIBER OPTIC MODULE AND SYSTEM INCLUDING REAR<br>
CONNECTORS); 11/138,063 (filed May 25, 2005, entitled FIBER OPTIC<br>
SPLITTER MODULE); 11/138,889 (filed May 25, 2005, entitled FIBER OPTIC<br>
ADAPTER MODULE); and 11/215,837 (filed August 29, 2005, entitled FIBER<br>
OPTIC SPLITTER MODULE WITH CONNECTOR ACCESS), the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The insertion of a splitter module 14 into chassis 12 is illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 31-35. Referring to FIGS. 31-35, insertion of fiber optic module 12 into front<br>
opening 30 of chassis 12 begins the mating of module 14 to chassis 12 and to<br>
adapters 64 of adapter assembly 16. Top flanges engage 44 top slots 40 and bottom<br>
flanges 46 engages bottom slots 42 of chassis 12 as module 14 is inserted.<br>
Still referring to FIGS. 31-35, chassis 12 includes a flexible shield<br>
182 in each mounting location 38. Shield 182 is adapted to prevent protection<br>
against accidental exposure to light. Shield 182 is positioned in front end 68 of each<br>
adapter 64 of adapter assembly 16. Before a splitter module 14 is placed in an<br>
associated mounting location 3S, if a connectorized cable that is connected to an<br>
adapter 64 of adapter assembly 16 is illuminated and transmitting light signals,<br>
shield 182 will prevent accidental exposure to these signals which might damage<br>
eyes or other sensitive organs, or nearby communications equipment. The insertion<br>
of splitter module 14 pushes shield 182 out of the way as illustrated in FIGS. 31-33.<br>
Shield 182 is deflected by module 14 as module 14 is inserted<br>
through front opening 30 so that connectors 118 of module 14 can mate with<br>
adapters 64 of adapter assemblies 16. Shield 182 is preferably made of a resilient<br>
deformable material that will return to the position when module 14 is withdrawn<br>
from mounting location 38.<br>
For example, in FIG 31, a fiberoptic splitter module 14 is shown<br>
partially inserted within chassis 12 prior to connectors 118 of splitter module 14<br>
having contacted shield 182 of chassis 12. In FIG. 32, fiber optic splitter module 14<br>
 <br>
is shown in a position within chassis 12 with connectors 11 8 of fiber optic splitter<br>
module 14 making initial contact with shield 182 of chassis 12 to move shield 182<br>
out of the way (a side cross-sectional view is shown in FIG. 34). In FIG. 33, fiber<br>
optic splitter module 14 is shown in a fully inserted position within chassis 12,<br>
having moved shield 182 out of the way (a side cross-sectional view is shown in<br>
FIG. 35).<br>
Shield 182 is configured such that shield 182 does not engage the<br>
ferrule 184 of connector 118 of splitter module 14 when connector 118 contacts<br>
shield 182 to move it out of the way. Instead, outer connector housing 150 pushes<br>
shield 182 out of the way.<br>
Shield 182 may be connected to chassis 12 by fasteners, or,<br>
alternatively, shield 182 may be formed integrally with chassis 12 or mounted by<br>
spot-welding or other fastening techniques.<br>
As shield 182 is fully deflected, further insertion of module 14 brings<br>
connectors 118 into contact with adapters 64 and connectors 118 are received within<br>
front ends 68 of adapters 64. Latch 52 is deflected inwardly as module 14 is inserted<br>
and then flexes back so that front lip 50 of bulkhead 48 is captured in recess 136.<br>
Module 14 is now in position to process and transmit signals from cable through<br>
first cable 178, optical component 158 and second cable 180 within module interior<br>
114.<br>
Referring to FIG. 35, as noted above, recess 136 between the two tabs<br>
132, 134 of latch 52 provides a certain amount of horizontal float for the splitter<br>
module 14 within chassis 12. Front lip 50 of bulkhead 48 is allowed to move a<br>
distance of D as indicated in FIG. 35 before it makes contact with square face 140 of<br>
rear tab 134. Splitter module 14 is configured such that, when splitter module 14 is<br>
pulled away from front 32 of chassis 12, distance D front lip 50 of bulkhead 48<br>
travels before contacting square face 140 of rear tab 134 is less than the horizontal<br>
float (i.e., distance A) provided for adapter assembly 16, as discussed before.<br>
In this manner, splitter module 14 provides a form of protection from<br>
accidentally disengaging connectors 118 of the module from adapter assemblies 16<br>
at rear 28 of chassis 12. The size of recess 136 of module 14 is configured such that<br>
the horizontal float of splitter module 14 is interrupted before the adapter assembly<br>
16 can be pulled far enough toward the front of chassis 12 to stop its horizontal<br>
 <br>
movement and accidentally disengage connectors 1 18 of module 14 from adapters<br>
64.<br>
FIGS. 36-45 illustrate a dust cap/test tool 190 configured for use with<br>
adapter assembly 16 of telecommunications assembly 10. Dust cap/test tool 190<br>
includes a body 192 with a front end 194 and a rear end 196. Dust cap/lest tool 190<br>
includes a pair of connectors 118 protruding out from front end 194. As shown in<br>
FIG. 39, the pair of connectors I 18 are slidably inserted into connector holders 193<br>
of the body 192 of dust cap/test tool 190. Connector holders 193 include slots 195<br>
for receiving flanges of outer housings of connectors 118, as in housing 94 of splitter<br>
module 14. Dust cap/test tool 190 also includes a pair of dust plugs 198 protruding<br>
out from rear end 196. Dust cap/test tool 190 includes a top wall 200 and a bottom<br>
wall 202 and a first transverse side 204 and a second transverse side 206. The top<br>
and the bottom walls 200, 202 include top and bottom flanges 208, 210,<br>
respectively, for slidable insertion into chassis 12 similar to fiber optic splitter<br>
module 14. First transverse side 204 includes a radius limiter 212 for guiding cables<br>
terminated to connectors 118 of dust cap/test tool 190. There is a first grip 214<br>
integrally formed with body 192 at front end 194. There is a second grip 216<br>
defined at the end of the radius limiter 212 integrally formed with body 192 at rear<br>
end 196 of dust cap/test tool 190.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 36 and 37, dust cap/test tool 190 is slidably<br>
insertable within chassis 12 and usable in two different ways. In FIG. 36, dust<br>
cap/test tool 190 is shown being used as a test tool to test the optical signals input<br>
into the adapter assemblies 16. Since adapter assemblies 16 are located at rear end<br>
28 of chassis 12 and front ends 68 of adapters 64 of adapter assemblies 16 are<br>
located in the interior of chassis 12 at rear 28, it becomes difficult to access to the<br>
connections for testing or other purposes. The pair of connectors 118 on front end<br>
194 of dust cap/test tool 190 are designed to be coupled to adapters 64 of adapter<br>
assembly 16 when dust cap/test tool 190 is slidably inserted into chassis 12. In this<br>
manner, the connections at adapter assemblies 16 can be tested without having to<br>
uncouple adapter assemblies 16 from chassis 12 and without having to reach into<br>
chassis 12.<br>
As shown in FIG. 37, dust cap/test tool 190 can also be flipped<br>
around 180° and used as a dust cap to seal the interior oFadapters 64 from<br>
contaminants. If a splitter module 14 is not inserted within one of the mounting<br>
 <br>
locations 38 of chassis 12, dust cap/test tool 190 can act as a placeholder and be<br>
slidably inserted within chassis 12. The dust plugs 198 include recessed portions<br>
199 for receiving protruding tabs 89 of arms 91 of housing halves at the interior of<br>
an adapter 64. The recessed portions 199 help retain the dust plugs 198 within the<br>
adapters 64.<br>
In FIG. 38, dust cap/ test tool 190 is shown in combination with an<br>
adapter assembly 16 exploded off. In FIG. 39, dust cap/ test tool 190 is shown with<br>
an adapter assembly 16 mounted thereon and shown with one of the testing<br>
connectors 118 of dust cap/test tool 190 exploded off dust cap/test tool 190.<br>
FIGS. 46-52 illustrate a grip extension 218 adapted for use with<br>
connectors 118 coupled to rear 70 of adapters 64 of adapter assembly 16. Grip<br>
extension 218 is designed to add length to the outer housing 150 of a connector 118<br>
to facilitate access to individual connectors 118 in dense environments such as the<br>
telecommunications assembly 10. Grip extension is preferably first mounted over a<br>
cable before the cable is terminated to a connector 118. Once the connector 118 is<br>
terminated to the cable, grip extension 218 is slid over the boot portion 220 of the<br>
connector and mounted to the outer housing 150 of connector 118 as shown in FIG.<br>
7.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 46-52, grip extension 218 includes an elongate<br>
body 222 with four cantilever arms extending from a front portion 224 of the body<br>
222. Two of the opposing cantilever arms 226, 228 include protruding labs 230 for<br>
engagement with the gripping surface 232 of outer housing 150 of connectors 118.<br>
Two of the other opposing cantilever arms 234, 236 include slits 238 for engaging<br>
the flanges 240 defined on connector outer housings 1 50. With the four cantilever<br>
arms 226, 22S, 234, 236, the grip extensions 218 arc snap-fit onto connector<br>
housings 150. The rear portion 242 of the grip extension body 222 includes a top<br>
side 244, an open bottom side 246 and two transverse sides 248, 250 that taper in<br>
going in a direction from the front 224 to the back 242. Top and bottom sides 244,<br>
246 include grip structures 252 to facilitate pulling on grip extensions 218 to remove<br>
connectors 118.<br>
