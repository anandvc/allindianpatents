CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/932,927, filed on June 1, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to anti-coking control systems for<br>
vehicles that perform regeneration using fuel injectors that inject fuel into the<br>
exhaust system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulates that are<br>
typically filtered from exhaust gas by a particulate filter (PF). The PF is disposed<br>
in an exhaust system of the engine. The PF reduces emission of particulate<br>
matter that is generated during combustion. Over time, the PF becomes full and<br>
the trapped particulate matter needs to be removed. During regeneration, the<br>
particulate matter is burned within the PF.<br>
[0005] An engine control system can estimate accumulation of the<br>
particulate matter and determine when the filter needs regeneration. Once<br>
 <br>
regeneration is needed, the control system enables regeneration by injecting fuel<br>
into the exhaust system. The heat released during combustion of the injected<br>
fuel in the diesel oxidation catalyst increases the exhaust temperature, which<br>
burns the trapped particulate matter in the PF. In some systems, the injectors of<br>
the engine are used to increase fuel by temporarily enriching the air/fuel mixture.<br>
The excess fuel in the exhaust gas after combustion is used to increase the<br>
temperature of the PF.<br>
[0006] Other systems use a fuel injector that is separate from the<br>
injectors associated with the fuel system. The injector injects fuel into the exhaust<br>
system. Performance issues may arise due to coking or deposit formation in fuel<br>
injection devices that are exposed to exhaust conditions. As a result, the fuel<br>
injection devices may experience poor durability.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A system comprises an injector for injecting fuel directly into an<br>
exhaust system. A control module supplies fuel using the injector to burn<br>
particulate matter in the particulate filter when the control module determines that<br>
regeneration is needed. The control module selectively supplies fuel to exercise<br>
the injector during periods when the control module determines that regeneration<br>
is not needed.<br>
[0008] In other features, an exhaust temperature sensor senses an<br>
exhaust temperature. A timer determines a period since a last injection using the<br>
at least one second injector. A degradation module determines degradation of<br>
 <br>
the at least one second injector based on the exhaust temperature and the<br>
period since a last injection using the at least one second injector. The control<br>
module selectively enables exercise of the at least one second injector based on<br>
enabling conditions. The enabling conditions include at least one of exhaust<br>
temperature, engine mode, and a period since a last use of the at least one<br>
second injector.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0010]	The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Coking and deposit formation described herein may be<br>
particularly challenging with fuel injection devices that are exposed to exhaust<br>
conditions and that are used relatively infrequently. For these fuel injection<br>
devices, there may be time intervals of inactivity where residual fuel oxidation<br>
and polymerization may occur.<br>
[0018] For example, injection devices may be used to facilitate or<br>
assist diesel particulate filter (PF) regeneration. The regeneration interval may be<br>
infrequent. For example only, the regeneration interval can be as long as several<br>
hundred miles. For example only, the injector device may be operated only when<br>
needed. Typically, the injector may be used about 15-30 minutes every 8-10<br>
operating hours. The regeneration intervals described above provide time<br>
periods during which deposit formation or fuel coking issues may occur.<br>
 <br>
[0019] The present disclosure reduces deterioration of fuel injection<br>
devices used in the exhaust systems of automotive products. The present<br>
disclosure monitors and models the conditions in the vehicle exhaust system.<br>
The present disclosure determines an appropriate schedule for the fuel injection<br>
system to exercise the injector that will minimize fuel consumption and emission<br>
control issues while improving fuel injection system durability. As a result, lower<br>
cost hardware and fuel injection components may be used. As can be<br>
appreciated, while the present disclosure describes a diesel engine application,<br>
the present disclosure may also be applied to internal combustion engines with a<br>
particulate filter as well as Hydrocarbon (HC) Selective Catalyst Reduction<br>
(SCR).<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine control<br>
system. The engine control system 12 includes an engine 14, an intake manifold<br>
16, a common rail fuel injection system 18 and a turbocharger27. The engine 14<br>
includes six cylinders 22 configured in adjacent cylinder banks 24 and 26 and in<br>
a V-type layout. Although FIG. 1 depicts six cylinders 22, it can be appreciated<br>
that the engine 14 may include additional or fewer cylinders 22. For example,<br>
engines having 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. It is also<br>
anticipated that the engine 14 can have an inline-type cylinder configuration.<br>
While a turbocharged diesel engine is shown, the present disclosure also applies<br>
to other engines such as naturally aspirated or supercharged engines.<br>
[0021] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 16 by the inlet vacuum<br>
created by an engine turbocharger 27. Air is ducted into the individual cylinders<br>
 <br>
22 from the intake manifold 16 and is compressed therein. Fuel is injected by the<br>
common rail injection system 18 and the heat of the compressed air ignites the<br>
air/fuel mixture. Exhaust gas is exhausted from the cylinders through exhaust<br>
conduits 28. The exhaust gas drives the turbocharger 27, which delivers<br>
additional air into the cylinders 22 for combustion.<br>
[0022] The exhaust gas enters a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 30,<br>
which facilitates chemical reactions with excess fuel in the exhaust gases.<br>
Exhaust gases from the DOC 30 pass through a particulate matter (PM) filter 31,<br>
which extracts PM from the exhaust stream. The exhaust gases exit the PM filter<br>
31.<br>
[0023] A control module 32 controls operation of the engine control<br>
system 12. More specifically, the control module 32 controls engine system<br>
operations based on various parameters. For example, the control module 32<br>
may be implemented in an engine control module (ECM), a vehicle computer, or<br>
may be an independent controller.<br>
[0024] The control module 32 may also perform engine system<br>
diagnostics. For example, the control module 32 may verify proper operation of<br>
the DOC 30. Additionally, the control module 32 may initiate a post-fuel injection<br>
process to heat the exhaust gases to the PM filter 31 by oxidizing fuel in the DOC<br>
30. The control module 32 may receive a temperature signal from an inlet<br>
temperature sensor 34 that senses the temperature of exhaust gases at the<br>
opening of the DOC 30. The control module 32 may also receive a temperature<br>
signal from an outlet temperature sensor 36 that senses the temperature of<br>
 <br>
exhaust gases that exit the DOC 30. The control module 32 may receive a<br>
pressure signal from an exhaust pressure sensor 37 that senses the air pressure<br>
in the exhaust system.<br>
[0025] The control module 32 may receive a speed signal from a speed<br>
sensor 38 in the engine 14. The control module 32 may receive a temperature<br>
signal from an engine coolant sensor 39 that senses a temperature of coolant in<br>
the engine 14. The control module 32 may receive a temperature signal from an<br>
inlet air temperature sensor 40 that detects an inlet air temperature of the engine<br>
14. The control module 32 may receive a pressure signal from an ambient<br>
pressure sensor 41 that senses a pressure of the air outside of the engine 14.<br>
The control module 32 may receive an airflow signal from a mass airflow sensor<br>
42 that detects a rate that air flows into the engine 14. Still other inputs may be<br>
provided.<br>
[0026] At various times, the control module 32 sends a command to an<br>
injector 50 to inject fuel into the exhaust system. A valve 52 such as a poppet<br>
valve may be used. The control module 32 may command fuel when<br>
regeneration of the PF 31 is needed. The control module 32 may also command<br>
fuel when regeneration is not needed to exercise the injector 50.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 2, a conduit from a supply of fuel may<br>
supply fuel to the injector 50. Another conduit 62 may connect an output of the<br>
injector to the valve 52, which is arranged adjacent to the exhaust system. The<br>
valve 52 and the injector 50 may be spaced a distance D that is sufficient to allow<br>
 <br>
cooling and to prevent damage to the injector 50 due to high exhaust gas<br>
temperatures.<br>
[0028] Any suitable valve or injector may be used including a low spray<br>
nozzle valve or injector such as the one shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, an<br>
exemplary valve 52 is shown. For example only, the valve 52 may include an<br>
upper housing 70, an upper guide 72, a valve body 73, a spring 74, a needle 76<br>
and a lower guide 78.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIGs. 4 and 5, control begins in step 200. In<br>
step 204, control looks up a fuel degradation factor as a function of exhaust<br>
temperature and a period since last injection event. For example, an exemplary<br>
relationship between injection amount, time and temperature is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
In step 208, the degradation factor is integrated. A new degradation factor is set<br>
equal to an old degradation factor plus a new lookup value. The time since the<br>
last injection is incremented.<br>
[0030] In step 210, control determines whether the degradation factor<br>
is greater than a degradation minimum. If false, control returns to step 204.<br>
Otherwise control continues with step 214. In step 214, control determines<br>
whether the time or the integrated time since last exercise is greater than a<br>
predetermined period tmin. If false, control returns to step 204. Otherwise control<br>
continues with step 218 and checks enabling conditions for injector exercise.<br>
Exemplary enabling conditions include exhaust temperature, ambient<br>
temperature and catalyst temperature. Other exemplary enabling conditions may<br>
be based on an engine operating mode.<br>
 <br>
[0031] Control continues from step 218 and control determines whether<br>
the exhaust temperature is greater than a predetermined temperature tempmin in<br>
step 222. If step 222 is false, control returns to step 218. If step 222 is true,<br>
control delivers a predetermined amount of fuel (such as Q grams) to exercise<br>
the injector (despite the fact that regeneration is not needed). Control continues<br>
with step 230 and fuel degradation factor, injector quantity, and time since last<br>
injection to zero. Control continues with step 204.<br>
[0032] This approach provides an optimal balance between durability,<br>
fuel consumption, and emission control. This control approach reduces coking<br>
by exercising the injector during the period in time when it is normally not used or<br>
needed. The frequency of exercise is dependent on operating time, temperature,<br>
and exhaust flow rate, among other items. Exercise is more frequent under<br>
particularly challenging conditions. Total fuel use and emission impact are<br>
negligible, while improving durability of the injection device.<br>
 <br>
