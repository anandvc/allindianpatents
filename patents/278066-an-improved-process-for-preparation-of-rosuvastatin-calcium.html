BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rosuvastatin, which is an antihyperchlolesterolemic drug, is chemically known as (E)-7-[4-(4- fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methyIsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5- dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium (2:1) salt of Formula 1.<br>
Rosuvastatin was for the first time disclosed in US 5,260,440. Rosuvastatin is being marketed under the proprietary name CRESTOR, as an oral tablet, for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In view of the importance of Rosuvastatin as a lipid-lowering agent, several synthetic methods have been reported in the literature to prepare Rosuvastatin, some of which are summarized below: <br>

The difficulties in the above process are that the intermediate (A) is not obtained in pure form readily. Further, its purification is tedious and overall yield is extremely low. Even when intermediate (A) is obtained in pure form, further condensation with intermediate (X) to form Rosuvastatin, does not result in Rosuvastatin of right quality as the product contains unacceptable quantity of impurity levels.<br>
WO 03/097614 describes a modified procedure for the preparation of the starting material 4-(4- fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-carbaxldehyde and further conversion to Rosuvastatin by condensing with methyl (3R)-3-[(tert- butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-5-oxo-6-triphenylphosphoranylidene hexanoate. The condensed product was deprotected using methanesulfonic acid and subsequently converted to Rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt.<br>
WO 2004/052867 describes a process to prepare Rosuvastatin by condensing 1-cyano (2S)-2- [(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-oxo-5-triphenylphosphoranylidenepentane with 4-(4- fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-carbaldehyde and subsequent deprotection of silyl group, followed by reduction and hydrolysis.<br>

(4R,6S)-2,2-dimethyl[l,3]dioxan-4-yl)acetate which comprises reaction of diphenyl {4-(4-<br>

WO 2004/014872 describes a process for the manufacture of Rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt which comprises mixing a solution of calcium chloride with a solution of water soluble salt of (E)7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5- yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept"6-enoic acid. This process for the preparation of Rosuvastatin employs the use of phosphorane side chain, the preparation of side chain requires eight <br>
synthetic steps and involves expensive reagents. The process is both uneconomical and time consuming, hence not appropriate for commercial scale operation.<br>

As mentioned above though there are number of processes available still there is a continuing need to identify alternative processes for the manufacture of Rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such processes may, for example, when compared to previously known processes, be more convenient to use, be more suitable for large scale manufacture, give the product in a better yield, reduce the number of steps involved, use intermediates which are more easily isolated, require less complex purification techniques, use less expensive reagents and/or be more environmentally friendly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a new improved process for the preparation of Rosuvastatin in high yield and high purity.<br>
The compound of Formula III is protected with a suitable hydroxy protecting group selected from tertiary butyldimethylsilyl chloride, 2,3-dihydropyran, trimethylsilylchloride, methoxymethyl chloride, more preferably tertiary butyldimethylsilyl chloride. The hydroxy protection is carried out in an organic solvent in presence of bases like imidazole, triethylamine. The usage of base is essential for completion of silylation. The organic solvent used for the above silylation reaction is selected from tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy ethane, dioxane, dichloromethane, ethylene dichloride, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide. <br>
<br>
N-methylpyrrolidine, sulfolane, more preferably N,N-dimethylformamide etc. Also during this silylation reaction a suitable additive is added to accelerate silylation which is selected from sodium iodide, potassium iodide, lithium iodide etc. The reaction is conducted at a temperature in the range of 0°-128°C, more preferably 50-80°C. The compound of Formula IV is isolated as an oily mass which is sufficiently pure for the next step.<br>
The hydroxy protected compound of Formula IV is treated with acid activator like 1,1-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole, or methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, phenyl chloroformate, 4-<br>
methoxyphenylchloroformate, 4-chlorophenylchloroformate, 2,4-dinitrophenylchloroformate,<br>
4-trifluoromethylphenylchloroformate,	4-nitrophenylchloroformate,	2-<br>
nitrophenylchloroformate, etc in presence of organic base more preferably 1,1-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole in the presence or absence of organic base. The organic base is selected<br>
from triethyl amine, pyridine etc. The resulting activated imidazolimide intermediate is<br>
subsequently treated with magnesium salt of monoalkyl malonate of Formula V. Magnesium<br>
salt of Formula V can be prepared by treating 2 moles of malonic acid mono alkyl ester with 1<br>
mole of magnesium ethoxide. This homologation is conducted at a temperature between 0-<br>
100°C, preferably at ambient temperature. The organic solvent used in the homologation is<br>
selected from tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, methylene dichloride, acetonitrile or<br>
mixtures thereof During the workup compound of Formula VI a which is generated in situ F<br>
COOR3	Formula VI a<br>
gets decarboxylated giving directly ketoester of Formula VI.<br>
The deprotection of the compound of Formula VI is carried out using acids having a general Formula HX wherein X represents halogen or MX wherein X represents halogen, M is cation derived from like inorganic metal like Na"^, K"^, Li^ etc or organic amine like N'^(R)4 where in R <br>
represents C1-C4 alkyl, straight chain, branched chain alkyl, sulfonic acids such as para toluene sulfonic acids, methanesulfonic acids, trifluormethane sulfonic acid, organic acids such as formic acid, trifluroacetic acid, acetic acid in aqueous solvent or in a mixture of organic solvent at room temperature. The reaction is preferably conducted in a organic solvent, water or mixtures thereof. The organic solvent can be selected from tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, ethylene dichloride, toluene, xylene etc.<br>
The compound of Formula VII is stereoselectively reduced with metal borohydride in presence of chelating agent like trialkylborane or boronates like dialkyl alkoxy borane more preferably diethyl methoxy borane. The stereoselective reduction is carried out in a mixture of inert solvent preferably tetrahydrofuran and lower alkanol, more preferably methanol at -TS^C-O'^C. The metal borohydride employed is selected from sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, calcium borohydride, more preferably sodium borohydride. After completion of reaction, excess borohydride is destroyed by acetic acid and resulting compound of Formula VIII is extracted into an organic solvent. The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude compound of Formula VIII that is utilized for hydrolysis step as such.<br>
Saponification of compound of Formula VIII is carried out using a base, such as alkali metal hydroxide selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, more preferably sodium hydroxide. The sodium salt of Rosuvastatin thus obtained can be optionally isolated or the solution containing of Rosuvastatin sodium is treated with Benzathaizine acetate to get the corresponding Benzathaizine salt which can be fiirther converted to Rosuvastatin calcium. Alternatively, aqueous sodium salt of Rosuvastatin can be treated with calcium ion source to give Rosuvastatin calcium.<br>
