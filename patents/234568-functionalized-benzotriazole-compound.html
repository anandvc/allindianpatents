				<td>ANTIOZONANT BASED FUNCTIONALIZED BENZOTRIAZOLE UV ABSORBERS AND THE PROCESS THEREOF Field of present invention<br>
This invention relates to the preparation of novel antiozonant as well as antioxidant<br>
based on functionalized benzotriazole UV  absorbers  and the process  for the<br>
preparation thereof which can fulfill the prerequisite of a polymer stabilizer and can<br>
be used with other polymer stabilizer.<br>
Background and prior art references of the present Application<br>
N-alkyl, N'-phenyl-p-phenylene diamines are revealed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,929,166;<br>
5,593,701; 6,329,473; 3,409,586; 3,424,713; 3,542,691; 3,663,505; 3,839,275 and<br>
British Patent No.   1,035,262.  Sulphur containing para-phenylene diamines are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,035,014.<br>
The one step acid catalyzed reaction with thiols, formaldehyde and aromatic amines is<br>
known in the prior art (J. Org. Chem., 24, 1035 (1959); J. Org. Chem., 28, 2763<br>
(1963) and J. Org. Chem., 30,28 (1965). Side chain bromination in UV absorbers are<br>

As known to the skilled in the art, degradation of rubber from ozone manifests itself<br>
by (i) crack appearing perpendicular to the stress in the rubber and (ii) the appearance<br>
of a silvery film on the surface of the article. The attack of ozone is a purely surface<br>
phenomenon. The function of the antiozonant depends on it's migration to the surface<br>
of the rubber article.<br>
Conventional diphenyl diamine antiozonants are widely used in the protection of<br>
rubber. Whereas one of these diphenyt diamine have in the past proved quiet<br>
satisfactory, recent developments in rubber technology has resulted in rubber products<br>
with extended service life and, therefore, require commensurate protection from<br>
ozonolysis. Therefore, there exists a need of new and efficient antiozonants offering<br>
extended protection  from  ozone.  The present invention relates to  polymeric<br>
antiozonant and their use in diene containing polymer.<br>
Amine containing antiozonants are commonly used in diene rubbers to avoid<br>
degradation   through   ozonolysis   and  oxidation.   Common   examples   of  such<br><br>
antioxidants are N,N-di-substituted p-phenylene diamines. There is a continuing need of superior antiozonants to further prolong the useful life of these rubber products. The present invention relates to a composition comprising a high molecular weight amine containing antiozonant that is prepared in two-step process. Most thermoplastic polymers and coating compositions are unstable to the extended exposure to ultraviolet light source in atmosphere. Thermoplastics and coatings tend to demonstrate unwanted colour changes and reduced mechanical strength upon exposure to UV and thermal radiation. The preliminary effect of ultraviolet radiation on polymers is the formation of free radicals on the polymer chain, which react with atmospheric oxygen. This results in the formation of peroxide groups. Furthermore, decomposition of peroxide groups causes formation of carbonyl groups and chain scission. Irradiation in absence of oxygen causes the increase in crosslinking. Ultimately, this reflects on the mechanical properties and the colour of the polymeric materials. In order to prevent or at least retard the damage caused by these factors, stabilizers are added to the plastics.<br>
Antioxidants are the compounds, which upon addition to the polymers are capable of preventing or retarding the reactions of degradation caused by heat and light energy in presence of oxygen. Triazines are one of the most important antioxidants, which are used commercially. There are many patents about the preparation and use of functional antioxidant in polymers and coatings.<br>
Monomeric and low molecular weight antioxidants are having limitation to their utility owing to their properties of migration and leaching. This phenomenon could lead to uneven distribution of antioxidants within the polymeric matrix. Leaching could be even more harmful as the loss of antioxidants from the polymer matrix could lead to extensive thermal and photo-degradation of the substrate. Therefore, in order to prevent the phenomena of migration and leaching, the antioxidants with polymerizing ability are being developed. This particular class of stabilizers would have even distribution within the polymer matrix and also they overcome the phenomena of migration and leaching. <br>

It relates to a new class of polymeric hindered amine light stabilizers based on maleic anhydride modified polyolefins reacted with tetramethyl piperidine derivatives. These materials are more effective than most of the generally used hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers but due to their higher molecular weights and the polyolefin backbone,<br>
they are more compatible with polyolefins.<br>

Polymer bound antioxidants are provided in which the antioxidant stabilizer groups<br>
are  chemically  bound  to  polymers  or copolymers by an  acylaminoimide  or<br>
diacylhydrazide function. The polymer bound antioxidants are prepared by reacting<br>
hydrazido substituted antioxidants with some or all of the anhydride groups of<br>
anhydride containing polymers or copolymers.The concentration of the stabilizers<br>
bound to the polymer may be readily varied depending upon the particular end-use of<br>
said polymer. Polymer with high concentrations of bound antioxidants can be used as<br>

In a 250 ml three-necked round bottomed flask, 2-(2H-Benzotriazole-2-yl)-4-bromomethylphenol (4.0 g; 0.0112 mol) was dissolved in 30 ml of dry carbon tetrachloride. In a separate conical flask,<br>
bromine (0.748 ml; 0.01176 mole) was dissolved in 45 ml of dry carbon tetrachloride and solution was transferred to a cylindrical funnel with pressure equalizing tube. Three-necked round-bottom flask containing solution of 2-(2H-Benzotriazole-2-yl)-4-bromomethylphenol was kept in oil-bath at 45 °C for 4 hrs and followed by 85°C for 9 hrs. Solution in the flask was continuously stirred with the help of magnetic stirrer. Bromine solution was added, drop-by-drop, from funnel to the flask for a span of 4-5 hours till all the solution was poured out. After that heating was stopped and the final reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature. Product was separated by solvent evaporation. Finally the product obtained was fine white crystalline and was absolutely pure. The yield of 2-(2H-Benzotriazole-2-yl)-4-bromomethylphenol was 4.071 g(75%), m.p. 169-171°C.<br>
