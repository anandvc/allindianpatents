				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING CYTOSINE NUCLEOSIDE COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
cytosine nucleoside compounds, which are useful as starting<br>
material for synthesis of compounds, such as those for medical<br>
use. More specifically, the invention relates to a method<br>
for producing cytosine nucleoside compounds from<br>
pentose-1-phosphate and cytosine or a cytosine derivative,<br>
by using an enzyme with cytosine-nucleoside phosphorylase<br>
activity, microbial cells with the enzyme activity, an enzyme<br>
preparation from the microbial cells or the culture thereof,<br>
or the like.<br>
Description of the related art<br>
Nucleoside phosphorylases generally refer to enzymes<br>
which phosphorolyze the N-glycoside bond of a nucleoside in<br>
the presence of phosphoric acid, and in the case where<br>
ribonucleoside is used, catalyze a reaction represented by<br>
the following equation:<br>
ribonucleoside + phosphoric acid (or a salt thereof)<br>
—&gt; base for nucleic acid + ribose-1-phosphate.<br>
Those enzymes, roughly divided into purine-nucleoside<br>
phosphorylases and pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylases,<br>
are distributed in a wide variety of living organisms, such<br>
as tissues including those of mammals, birds or fish, yeast<br>
or bacteria. These enzyme reactions are reversible, and<br><br>
synthesis of different nucleosides thus utilizing the reverse<br>
rections has been known. For example, there are known methods<br>
for production of thymidine (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
01-104190) , 2 ' -deoxyadenosine (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
11-137290) or 2' -deoxyguanosine (Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
No. 11-137290), respectively, from<br>
2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate and a base for nucleic acid<br>
(thymine, adenine or guanine). Thus, production of a<br>
nucleoside using a phosphorylase can be produced<br>
regio-specif ically and stereospecif ically in a mild condition,<br>
and many nucleoside compounds are studied for synthesis.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-60396 describes a process<br>
for production of deoxycytidine by the reaction of<br>
deoxyribose-1-phosphate with cytosine using bacterial cells<br>
themselves as catalyst. Though the process of the application<br>
uses bacterial cells per se as reaction catalyst, it is<br>
uncertain whether cytosine-nucleoside phosphorylase itself<br>
may exist therein. There is a possibility such that<br>
deoxycytidine accumulated in the bacterial cells may have<br>
leached out of the cells during the reaction, or that nucleoside<br>
deoxyribosyltransf erase within the cells may have transferred<br>
cytosine added as substrate to the base of deoxynucleoside<br>
within the cells, resulting in detection of deoxycytidine.<br>
The inventors sent for the seven bacterial strains that have<br>
been deposited for the examples of the application, and tested<br>
the production of deoxycytidine from deoxyribose-1-phosphate<br>
and cytosine according to the examples. As a result,<br>
deoxycytidine could not be detected in the solution of the<br><br>
reaction using any one of the strains, indicating that enzyme<br>
activity corresponding to cytosine-nucleoside phosphorylase<br>
was not present in the strains themselves.<br>
On the other hand, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-127986<br>
describes a novel nucleoside phosphorylase acting on both<br>
purine and pyrimidine bases, where the pyrimidine base is<br>
deoxyuridine, deoxycytidine or deoxythymidine, but no<br>
substrate specificity of the enzyme is disclosed in the<br>
specification. Further, the application has already been<br>
withdrawn and therefore the enzyme activity cannot be<br>
characterized any more. The inventors of the application,<br>
however, purified a nucleoside phosphorylase from the strain<br>
of the same designation as that disclosed in the application,<br>
and reported the characteristics thereof in Applied and<br>
Environmental Microbiology, Vol. 56, pp. 3830-3834 (1990).<br>
The article states that the above enzyme has no activity to<br>
cytosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine.<br>
Apart from the enzyme described above, it is not known<br>
that cytosine or any derivative thereof may be a substrate<br>
for either purine nucleoside phosphorylase or pyrimidine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase. For example, thymidine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase, one of pyrimidine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylases , derived from Salmonera typhimurium described<br>
in Method. Enzymology, Vol. 51, pp. 437-442 (1978) has no<br>
activity to deoxycytidine. In addition, it is reported in<br>
J. Biol. Chem. , Vol. 248, No. 6, pp. 2040-2043 (1973) that<br>
purine nucleoside phosphorylase derived from Salmonera<br><br>
typhimurium has no activity to pyrimidine nucleoside, such<br>
as uridine, cytidine, deoxyuridine or deoxycytidine.<br>
When these publications are totally considered, an enzyme<br>
corresponding to cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase related<br>
to the present invention may have been existent, but none<br>
of those preceding publications could confirm it and actually<br>
obtain the enzyme.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Production of a nucleoside compound using nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase enables the nucleoside to be synthesized both<br>
regiospecifically and stereospecifically under mild<br>
conditions, thereby prompting synthetic studies of various<br>
nucleoside compounds. However, no isolated and purified<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase has ever been reported that is able<br>
to synthesize a cytosine nucleoside compound from cytosine<br>
or a derivative thereof and sugar phosphate as substrate.<br>
Also, the inventors have found that if bacterial cells<br>
per se are used, or if an enzyme preparation for use, prepared<br>
from bacterial cells and/or culture broth thereof, has the<br>
remainder of cytosine or cytidine deaminase activity, which<br>
is generally present in the cells, both cytosine or the<br>
derivative thereof as substrate and the cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound as product may be deaminated, thereby making<br>
efficient accumulation of the cytosine nucleoside compound<br>
difficult.<br>
One object of the present invention is thus to provide<br>
the amino acid sequence of a nucleoside phosphorylase capable<br><br>
of synthesizing a cytosine nucleoside compound. Another<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a recombinant<br>
plasmid containing the corresponding gene, a transformant<br>
carrying the recombinant plasmid, a method for producing the<br>
enzyme using the transformed bacterial strain and a method<br>
for producing a cytosine nucleoside compound using the<br>
transformed bacterial strain. Another object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a method for reducing cytosine or<br>
cytidine deaminase activity, while keeping the activity of<br>
the nucleoside phosphorylase, or to provide a method for<br>
efficiently producing a cytosine nucleoside compound by using<br>
a bacterial strain having expressed cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase in another bacterial strain devoid of both<br>
deaminase.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method for reducing the activity of an enzyme capable of<br>
dephosphorylating sugar phosphate as starting material, or<br>
to provide a method for efficiently producing a cytosine<br>
nucleoside compound by using a bacterial strain having<br>
expressed cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase in another<br>
bacterial strain devoid of the enzyme.<br>
In the production of a cytosine nucleoside compound,<br>
especially for preparing a pharmaceutical product, mixing<br>
even a minute amount of a byproduct therein may cause a serious<br>
problem. In the purification step, separation of the<br>
byproduct nucleoside from the cytosine nucleoside compound<br>
may impose a heavy burden on the step as well as decrease<br>
the recovery of the compound, which will be a serious problem<br><br>
in case of commercial production. In the case where the<br>
compound is to be used for such a purpose, it is required<br>
to eliminate cytosine or cytidine deaminase activity from<br>
the enzyme preparation as completely as possible.<br>
The inventors addressed themselves to solving these<br>
subjects, resulting in the unexpected finding that a purine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase, which in itself should catalyze<br>
a reaction involving purine base as substrate, is able to<br>
catalyze a reaction for producing a cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound from cytosine or a derivative thereof, which is a<br>
sort of pyrimidine base, and pentose-1-phosphate.<br>
The presence of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase that<br>
the inventors found also indicates the presence of cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase.<br>
However, the reaction of cytosine or a derivative thereof<br>
with pentose-1-phosphate in the presence of the bacterium<br>
having this enzyme activity was found to produce almost<br>
exclusively the deaminated products of cytosine or the<br>
derivative thereof and the cytosine nucleoside compound, thus<br>
failing in efficient accumulation of the cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound of interest. Intensive work revealed that formation<br>
of the deaminated products was due to the action of deaminases ,<br>
and that the cytosine and cytidine deaminases could be<br>
deactivated by placing the bacterial cells in an organic<br>
solvent with or without stirring under still stand, or by<br>
heating them, and also that deactivation of cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase to be maintained could be controlled<br><br>
efficiently by addition of phosphate or sugar phosphate into<br>
the fluid to be processed.<br>
It was now found possible, by means of the method<br>
described above, to reduce specifically decomposition of the<br>
substrate and/or the product with the activity of the<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase maintained, and to produce the<br>
cytosine nucleoside compound with little or no byproduct from<br>
cytosine or the derivative thereof and the sugar phosphate,<br>
by using the bacterial cells whose deaminase activity was<br>
previously eliminated or decreased by the processing as<br>
mentioned above. The finding is inventive.<br>
The processing for eliminating or decreasing the<br>
deaminase activity according to the present invention may<br>
eliminate the decomposing activity almost completely, while<br>
the activity of the cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase can<br>
be maintained almost completely. Furthermore, it was also<br>
found possible to efficiently produce a cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound by expressing the phosphorylase in a bacterium devoid<br>
of both enzyme activities of cytosine and cytidine deaminases .<br>
The findings are inventive.<br>
Also, the reaction yield was found to be lowered in the<br>
presence of an enzyme capable of dephosphorylating the sugar<br>
phosphate as starting material. The enzyme could be<br>
selectively deactivated by addition of a polar solvent to<br>
the disrupted cells of a bacterium having the enzyme activity.<br>
The enzyme activity could be also removed through a<br>
purification procedure for the cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase, such as fractionation by salting out or<br><br>
adsorption onto an ion-exchange resin carrier or the like.<br>
It was found that these treatments enabled a cytosine<br>
nucleoside compound to be produced efficiently. The finding<br>
is inventive. Further, expression of the cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase in a bacterium devoid of the dephosphorylating<br>
enzyme was found to efficiently produce the cytosine<br>
nucleoside compound. The findings are inventive.<br>
The present invention provides a method for efficiently<br>
producing a cytosine nucleoside compound using cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase, which has never been attained.<br>
The present invention is thus described as follows.<br>
The method for producing a cytosine nucleoside compound<br>
according to the present invention is characterized by<br>
including a step wherein the cytosine nucleoside compound<br>
is obtained in the reaction of a sugar phosphate with cytosine<br>
or a derivative thereof in the presence of an enzyme with<br>
the activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase.<br>
The enzyme includes an enzyme with the activity of purine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase, and thus an enzyme preparation<br>
containing the activity of purine nucleoside phosphorylase<br>
may be used appropriately in the method for producing the<br>
cytosine nucleoside compound of the present invention. An<br>
example of such enzyme with the activity of purine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase is an enzyme derived from Escherichia coli.<br>
The cytosine derivative described above is represented<br>
by formula (I) as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein X denotes a carbon or nitrogen atom, and Y is a hydrogen<br>
atom, a halogen atom or a lower alkyl group. Examples thereof<br>
are azacytosine and 5-fluorocytosine.<br>
The enzyme with the activity of cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase as described above may be provided in the form<br>
of bacterial cells having the enzyme, or enzyme preparations<br>
including crude enzyme extract and purified enzyme<br>
preparation which can be obtained from the cells or the culture<br>
thereof into the reaction system.<br>
The bacterial cells or enzyme preparation may be<br>
preferably devoid of cytosine and cytidine deaminase<br>
activities, or if they are present, so depleted as to be able<br>
to produce the cytosine nucleoside compound by means of the<br>
activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase. As an example,<br>
the bacterial cells or enzyme preparation with a higher<br>
activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase than cytosine<br>
and cytidine deaminase activities are suitable for use.<br>
An example of such bacterial cells or enzyme preparation<br>
is one processed to reduce cytosine and cytidine deaminase<br>
activities that it has.<br>
The processed bacterial cells as described above, where<br>
the deaminase activities have been lost or reduced, may be<br>
obtained, as an example, by contacting the bacterial cells<br>
having the activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase with<br><br>
an aqueous solution containing organic solvent in order to<br>
reduce selectively cytosine and cytidine deaminase activities .<br>
The organic solvent includes a polar solvent such as an alcohol.<br>
The organic solvent may be at least one solvent selected from<br>
the group including, for example, methyl alcohol, ethyl<br>
alcohol, propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, dioxane and acetone.<br>
In addition, the concentration of the organic solvent<br>
in water may be preferably 20% (v/v) or more when the organic<br>
solvent eliminates or reduces the cytosine and cytidine<br>
deaminase activities.<br>
On the other hand, the processed bacterial cells, where<br>
the deaminase activities have been lost or reduced, may also<br>
be obtained by heating the bacterial cells having the activity<br>
of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase in an aqueous solution<br>
at such a temperature as to reduce selectively cytosine and<br>
cytidine deaminase activities. Heating may be conducted at<br>
50°C or higher for 10 minutes to 40 hours.<br>
In addition, when the bacterial cells are processed so<br>
as to eliminate or reduce the deaminase activities, the<br>
presence of pentose-1-phosphate allows the activity of<br>
cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase to be maintained more<br>
efficiently. The concentration of pentose-1-phosphate may<br>
be preferably in the range from 1 mM to 100 mM.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The term cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase refers to<br>
an enzyme able to produce a cytosine nucleoside compound from<br>
cytosine or a derivative thereof as substrate, and may be<br>
derived from any of an animal, a plant or a microbe if the<br>
requirement is satisfied. Generally, the enzyme termed<br>
cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase is unknown in the art.<br>
Therefore, this term is defined only in the present invention<br>
as mentioned above. A suitable example of such cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylases is an enzyme conventionally known<br>
as purine nucleoside phosphorylase which bacteria belonging<br>
to genus Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli contain and<br>
having also the activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase.<br>
As an embodiment, the DNA base sequence for the purine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase of Escherichia coli is illustrated<br>
as SEQ ID NO: 3 and the amino acid sequence translated from<br>
the base sequence as SEQ ID NO: 4. Recent progress in genetic<br>
engineering has made it easier to modify an amino acid sequence<br>
by means of deactivation, insertion or substitution for a<br>
part of the base sequence. Such level of technology has<br><br>
enabled the amino acid sequence to be modified through<br>
modification of the part of the base sequence without affecting<br>
the desired enzyme activity, that is to say, with the enzyme<br>
activity maintained or even elevated, and the amino acid<br>
sequence thus modified is also included by the cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase according to the present invention.<br>
For example, an amino acid sequence modified from the amino<br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein deletion, substitution<br>
or addition has occurred for 2 to 3 amino acids without<br>
affecting the enzyme activity of interest, and an amino acid<br>
sequence coded by a base sequence modified from the base<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, where mutation such as deletion,<br>
substitution or addition has occurred without affecting the<br>
enzyme activity of interest, while the complementary sequence<br>
can hybridize under stringent conditions, may be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
If an enzyme has thus the activity of purine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase, the enzyme alone can produce both purine-type<br>
and cytosine nucleoside compounds , thereby providing a great<br>
advantage for commercial production of nucleosides.<br>
The enzyme with the activity of cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase used in the method of the present invention<br>
may be provided in the form of bacterial cells having the<br>
enzyme, or an enzyme preparation prepared from the cells or<br>
the culture thereof into the reaction system. This enzyme<br>
preparation includes the bacterial cells or the culture<br>
thereof processed variously, enzyme extract, the enzyme<br>
extract purified to some extent or as isolate and the like.<br><br>
The bacterial cells or enzyme preparation may be one<br>
commercially available or prepared utilizing any of various<br>
methods. The preparation with the enzyme activity may be<br>
selected from, for example, a commercially available enzyme,<br>
bacterial cells with the enzyme activity and a preparation<br>
by cell treatment or an immobilized form thereof. Examples<br>
of the cell treatment preparation include acetone-dried cells<br>
and disrupted cells, cell debris, prepared by means of any<br>
treatment, such as mechanical disruption, ultrasonic<br>
disruption, freezing and thawing, pressurization and<br>
depressurization, osmotic shock, self-lysation, cell wall<br>
disintegration or surfactant treatment, and also a purified<br>
enzyme obtained by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or<br>
acetone, or by column chromatography, if necessary.<br>
The bacterium with the activity of cytosine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase is not limited in particular, if it expresses<br>
cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase able to produce a cytosine<br>
nucleoside compound from cytosine or a derivative thereof<br>
as substrate. Such a bacterium may be selected from, for<br>
example, common bacteria expressing nucleoside phosphorylase.<br>
Suitable examples of such bacteria producing nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase are bacteria belonging to genus Escherichia,<br>
such as Escherichia coli. Recent progress in molecular<br>
biology and genetic engineering has made it possible and then<br>
easier to obtain the gene for the purine nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase from the bacterial strain via analysis of the<br>
molecular biological properties and amino acid sequence of<br>
the enzyme, then construct a recombinant plasmid where the<br><br>
gene and a regulator region for expressing it have been inserted,<br>
and then create a recombinant bacterium where the protein<br>
has been expressed, through transfer of the plasmid into any<br>
host bacterium. Considering such level of technology, a<br>
recombinant bacterium created by incorporation of the gene<br>
for the nucleoside phosphorylase into any host bacterium is<br>
also included in the bacterium expressing the activity of<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase according to the present invention.<br>
The regulatory region necessary for the gene expression<br>
described herein includes a promoter sequence (including a<br>
operator sequence to control transcription), a<br>
ribosome-binding sequence (a SD sequence), and a<br>
transcription termination sequence. Examples of the<br>
promoter sequence may be a trp promoter that is a tryptophan<br>
operon derived from E. coli, a lac promoter as lactose operon,<br>
a PL or PR promoter derived from λ phage, a gluconate synthase<br>
promoter (gnt) derived from Bacillus subtilis, an alkaline<br>
protease promoter (apr), a neutral protease promoter (npr)<br>
and an a-amylase promoter (amy). Sequences specifically<br>
designed and modified, such as a tac promoter may also be<br>
used. Examples of the ribosome-binding sequence may be such<br>
sequences derived from E. coli or B. subtilis, but are not<br>
limited in particular provided that they function within a<br>
desirable host such as E. coli or B. subtilis. As an example,<br>
a consensus sequence where a sequence of 4 or more consecutive<br>
bases is complementary to the 3'-terminal region of a 16 S<br>
ribosomal RNA may be prepared in DNA synthesis, and then used<br>
for the purpose. The transcription termination sequence is<br><br>
not essential, but, if necessary, ones independent of the<br>
p factor, such as a lipoprotein terminator and a trp operon<br>
terminator can be used. These regulatory regions on the<br>
recombinant plasmid are preferably arranged in the order of<br>
the promoter sequence, the ribosome-binding sequence, the<br>
gene coding nucleoside phosphorylase and the transcription<br>
termination sequence, from the 5'-terminal on the upstream<br>
side.<br>
Examples of the plasmid described herein that can be<br>
used as vector may be pBR322, pUC18, Bluescript II SK (+),<br>
pKK223-3 and pSClOl having a region in E. coli where it is<br>
able to self-replicate, and pUB11O, pTZ4, pC194, ρ11, 1 and<br>
105 having a region in B. subtilis where it is able to<br>
self-replicate. In addition, examples of the plasmid that<br>
is able to self-replicate in more than one bacterial strain<br>
and may be used as vector are pHV14, TRp7, YEp7 and pBS7.<br>
Any bacterial host described herein includes Escherichia<br>
coli as typical example which will be described below in the<br>
Examples, but is not limited to E. coli in particular and<br>
also includes other microbial strains, such as bacteria<br>
belonging to Genus Bacillus such as Bacillus subtilis, yeasts<br>
and actinomycetes.<br>
The cytosine nucleoside compound according to the present<br>
invention refers to a compound where a sugar phosphate and<br>

bound together via a N-glycoside bond. Its typical examples<br>
arecytidine, deoxycytidine, dideoxycytidine, azacytidine.<br><br>
deoxyazacytidine, 5-fluorocytidine and<br>
5-fluorodeoxycytidine, but not limited to these compounds.<br>
The cytosine derivative according to the present<br>
invention refers to a compound which has a cytosine structural .<br>
moiety convertible to a cytosine nucleoside structure by the<br>
action of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase. Preferable<br>
examples of the cytosine derivative are cytosine derivatives<br>
represented by the general formula (I) described above. As<br>
the lower alkyl group of Y in the general formula (I), an<br>
alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl<br>
group, a sec-butyl group and a tert-butyl group. Among the<br>
cytosine derivatives, for example, azacytosine,<br>
5-fluorocytosine and 5-methylcytosine are particularly<br>

These sugar phosphates can be prepared by the method<br>
wherein they are produced by phosphorolysis of nucleoside<br>
compounds with nucleoside phosphorylase (J. Biol. Chem. Vol.<br>
184, 437, 1950), or also by methods of chemical synthesis<br>
selective to the anomers.<br>
Furthermore, the method of enzymatic synthesis for<br>
deoxyribose 1-phosphate as described in WO 01/14566 may be<br>
utilized. (The route for synthesis of deoxyribose 1-phosphate<br>
according to the patent assigned to Roche Ltd. is also referred<br>
to therein.)<br>
The processing for reducing cytosine and cytidine<br>
deaminase activities according to the present invention is<br>
not limited in particular, provided that the deaminase<br>
activities can be eliminated or reduced without deactivating<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase, but a suitable processing is<br>
exemplified by exposure of the bacterial cells, their culture<br>
or the processed material thereof to an organic solvent, or<br>
heat treatment of any one of the above.<br>
The organic solvent according to the present invention<br>
may be any solvent capable of eliminating cytosine and cytidine<br>
deaminase activities. The organic solvent includes, but is<br>
not limited to, a polar solvent, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl<br>

cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, heptane, cycloheptane,<br>
octane, cyclooctane, isooctane, nonane, decane, dodecane,<br>
petroleum ether, petroleum benzin, ligroin, industrial<br>
gasoline, kerosene, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene,<br>
propylbenzene, cumene, mesitylene or naphthalene; a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene or<br>
dichlorobenzene; a phenol, such as cresol or xylenol; aketone,<br>
such as methyl isobutyl ketone or 2-hexanone; and an ether,<br>
such as dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, diphenyl ether<br>
and dibenzyl ether; and also a hydrocarbon, such as pentane,<br>
hexane, heptane, octane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane,<br>
cycloheptane, cycloctane, toluene or ethylbenzene. Among<br>
other organic solvents used in the present invention are amide<br>
compounds, such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>

N-ethylformamide, N-methylacetamide, formamide, acetamide<br>
and benzamide, urea compounds, such as urea,<br>
N,N'-dimethylurea, tetramethylurea and<br>
N,N' -dimethylimidazolidinone, and sulf oxide compounds, such<br>
as dimethyl sulfoxide, diethyl sulfoxide and diphenyl<br>
sulfoxide.<br>
The processing with the organic solvent for eliminating<br>
or reducing deaminase activities according to the present<br><br>
invention is not limited in particular, provided that cytosine<br>
and cytidine deaminase activities can be eliminated or reduced<br>
without deactivating nucleoside phosphorylase, but a suitable<br>
processing is conducted under conditions where the bacterial<br>
cells, their culture or the processed material thereof is<br>
kept standstill or suspended at pH 4.0 to 10.0, preferably<br>
pH 6.0 to 9.0, at the concentration of the organic solvent<br>
in water not less than 10% by volume, preferably not less<br>
than 20% by volume, more preferably not less than 30% by volume,<br>
at a temperature not lower than 0°C, preferably ranging from<br>
20°C, preferably 50°C, to 80°C, for 10 minutes or more,<br>
preferably up to 40 hours, more preferably for 1 to 20 hours.<br>
Further, addition of the sugar phosphate at not less<br>
than 1 mM, preferably at not more than 100 mM, to the above<br>
processed fluid can make the nucleoside phosphorylase more<br>
stable.<br>
Addition of the organic solvent into the reaction<br>
solution may be also effective similarly.<br>
Heat treatment according to the present invention is<br>
not limited in particular, provided that cytosine and cytidine<br>
deaminase activities can be eliminated or reduced without<br>
deactivating nucleoside phosphorylase, but a suitable heat<br>
treatment is conducted under conditions where the bacterial<br>
cells, their culture or the processed material thereof is<br>
kept standstill or suspended in an aqueous medium at pH 4.0<br>
to 10.0, preferably pH 6.0 to 9 .0, at a temperature not lower<br>
than 50°C, preferably ranging from 60 to 80°C, for 10 minutes<br>
or more, more preferably for 30 minutes or more. Further,<br><br>
addition of the sugar phosphate at not less than 1 mM,<br>
preferably at 10 to 100 mM, to the above treated fluid can<br>
make the nucleoside phosphorylase more stable.<br>
As regards the bacterium without either cytosine or<br>
cytidine deaminase activity, a cytidine-deaminase deficient<br>
strain of a bacterium belonging to Bacillus genus may be used<br>
because bacteria belonging to the genus generally have only<br>
cytidine deaminase, but not cytosine deaminase. Such a strain<br>
is, for example. Bacillus subtilis 1A479 available from<br>
Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGCS) . Bacterial cells having<br>
expressed the nucleoside phosphorylase in such a strain may<br>
also be used herein.<br>
The phosphatase deficient strain according to the present<br>
invention is exemplified by E. coliK-12 DH5α devoid of alkaline<br>
phosphatase. Bacterial cells having expressed the cytosine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase in such a strain may also be used<br>
herein.<br>
Heat treatment of such bacterial cells may deactivate<br>
or decrease acid phosphatase, thereby attaining a higher yield<br>
of the product. A suitable heat treatment is conducted under<br>
conditions where the bacterial cells, their culture or the<br>
processed material thereof is kept standstill or suspended<br>
in an aqueous medium at pH 4.0 to 10.0, preferably pH 6.0<br>
to 9 . 0 , at a temperature not lower than 50°C, preferably ranging<br>
from 60 to 80°C, for 10 minutes or more, more preferably for<br>
30 minutes or more.<br>
The processing for reducing or removing an inhibitor<br>
of the activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase<br><br>
according to the present invention is not limited in particular,<br>
provided that the inhibitor can be removed or reduced, but<br>
a suitable processing is typically to prepare a solution of<br>
the enzyme through ultrasonic disruption of the bacterial<br>
cells, and then to add a polar solvent to the enzyme solution<br>
in order to precipitate the cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase,<br>
or to add ammonium sulfate to the solution in order to salt<br>
out and precipitate the enzyme, or to purify it with ion<br>
exchange resin.<br>
The reaction for synthesis of the cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound according to the present invention is conducted using<br>
the bacterial cells, their culture or the processed material<br>
thereof, derived from the bacterium that expresses the<br>
cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase capable of synthesizing<br>
the cytosine nucleoside compound from cytosine or a derivative<br>
thereof and the sugar phosphate as substrate, wherein the<br>
bacterium-derived matter has lost or is devoid of activity<br>
to decompose cytosine or the derivative thereof and the<br>
cytosine nucleoside compound, and it may usually be conducted<br>
under the conditions of pH 4 to 10 and a temperature ranging<br>
from 10 to 80°C. Both concentrations of the sugar phosphate<br>
and cytosine or the derivative thereof used in the reaction<br>
may range preferably from 0.1 to 1000 mM, and the molar<br>
concentration ratio of cytosine or the derivative thereof<br>
to the sugar phosphate or its salt should be from 0.1 to 10,<br>
preferably about 0.95 taking into account the conversion rate<br>
of the reaction.<br><br>
A metal salt which forms a poorly soluble phosphate salt<br>
with phosphoric acid, or a carrier such as ion exchange resin<br>
may be added in order to trap phosphoric acid formed in the<br>
reaction medium and thereby elevate the reaction yield.<br>
Separation of the cytosine nucleoside compound from the<br>
reaction solution may be conducted taking advantage of the<br>
solubility difference of the compound against the solvent<br>
such as water, or using ion exchange or adsorbent resin.<br>
A trace amount of cytosine remaining in the reaction<br>
solution may be eliminated by converting it to uracil, using<br>
a bacterium expressing cytosine deaminase which has been<br>
processed to reduce or deactivate cytidine deaminase, or using<br>
a bacterium created by expression of cytosine deaminase in<br>
a bacterial strain devoid of cytidine deaminase.<br>
The procedure of passing the reaction solution through<br>
cationic ion exchange resin enables the cytosine nucleoside<br>
compound to be separated and purified readily, because uracil<br>
that has been formed from remaining cytosine and/or the uracil<br>
nucleoside compound that has been formed via decomposition<br>
of the cytosine nucleoside compound are not adsorbed by the<br>
resin, though only the cytosine nucleoside compound is<br>
adsorbed.<br>
[Examples]<br>
The present invention will be described in the Examples<br>
below, but is not limited by these Examples.<br>
Analytical Procedure:<br>
[Analytical method]<br><br>
Cytosine nucleoside compounds produced were all<br>
quantified by means of high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The conditions of analysis are shown in the following.<br>
Column: Develosil ODS-MG-5, 4.6 x 250 mm (Nomura Kagaku)<br>
Column temperature; 40°C<br>
Pumping flow rate; 1.0 ml/min<br>
Detection; UV 254 nm<br>
Eluate; 50 mM monopotassium phosphate : methanol = 8:1<br>
(v/v)<br>
Reference Example 1: (a reproducibility test with respect<br>
to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-60396)<br>
Synthesis of deoxycytidine was attempted according to<br>
Example 1 described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-60396 .<br>
Thus, the 7 bacterial strains deposited, as shown in Table<br>
1, were selected from the group of 24 strains described in<br>
the Example 1 and then received. A 50 ml aliquot of a medium<br>
(pH 7.0) containing yeast extract at 0.5 g/dl, peptone at<br>
1.0 g/dl, meat extract at 1.0 g/dl and NaCl at 10.5 g/dl was<br>
poured into a flask with shoulders of 500 ml by volume and<br>
then sterilized. Each of the bacteria, shown in Table 1,<br>
that was cultured preliminarily on a nutrient-broth agar<br>
medium at 30°C for 16 hours, was seeded to the above medium<br>
with a loop of the cells and shake cultured at 30°C for 16<br>
hours. The cell mass was separated from the culture solution<br>
by centrifugation, then washed with 0.05 M phosphate buffer<br>
(pH 7.0) and then centrifuged to prepare the cleaned mass.<br>
The above cleaned mass was added to a solution of 20<br>
mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate and 20 mM cytosine in 100 ml<br><br>
of 0.05 M tris buffer (pH 7.2) so as to make its concentration<br>
at 5 g/dl, and then subjected to the reaction at 60°C for<br>
24 hours. After the reaction solution was diluted and a<br>
portion of the dilution was then analyzed by HPLC, it was<br>
found that cytosine as substrate was decomposed to a nearly<br>
100% loss, and that deoxycytidine was not detected.<br><br>
Reference Example 2 : (PNP cloning and creation of a strain<br>
expressing the cloned DNA, and preparation of the control<br>
cells)<br>
The genomic DNA from Escherichia coli was prepared as<br>
follows:<br>
Escherichia coli strain K-12/XL-10 (from Stratagene)<br>
was seeded into 50 ml of LB medium and cultured at 37°C overnight,<br>
and thereafter the cell mass was collected and then lyzated<br>
with a lyzating solution containing lysozyme at 1 mg/ml. The<br>
lyzating solution was treated with phenol and then the DNA<br>
was precipitated with ethanol as usual. The resulting DNA<br>
precipitate was wound around a glass stick for recovery and<br>
then washed to use it for PCR.<br><br>
As primer for PCR, oligonucleotides (entrusted to<br>
Hokkaido System Science for synthesis) with the base sequences<br>
shown by SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively, were used, wherein<br>
the base sequences were designed based on the base sequence<br>
on the deoD gene (GenBank accession No. AE000508 (with the<br>
coding region of BASE NOs. 11531 to 12250)) that codes a known<br>
purine nucleoside phosphorylase native to E. coli. These<br>
primers have the recognition sequences of restriction enzymes<br>
EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, near 5'-terminal and<br>
3'-terminal. The PCR was conducted by 30 cycles for the<br>
reaction cycle consisting of denaturation at 96°C for 1 minute,<br>
anealing at 55°C for 1 minute and extension reaction at 74°C<br>
for 1 minute, using 0 .1 ml of PCR reaction solution containing<br>
6 ng/μl of the above described genomic DNA from Escherichia<br>
coli, which has been completely digested by the restriction<br>
enzyme HindIII , and 3 μM of each primer.<br>
The above reaction product and plasmid pUC18 (from Takara<br>
Shuzo) were digested by EcoRI and HindIII, ligated with<br>
Ligation Hi (from Toyobo) and then E. coli DH5α was transformed<br>
using the resulting recombinant plasmid. The transformant<br>
was cultured on a LB agar medium containing 50 μg/ml of<br>
ampicillin (Am) and X-Gal<br>
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside) to obtain the<br>
transformant that has become Am resistant and formed white<br>
colonies.<br>
The plasmid extracted from the transformant thus obtained<br>
and having the DNA fragment of interest inserted was named<br>
pUC-PNP73. The base sequence of the DNA fragment inserted<br><br>
in pUC-PNP73 was identified by the common method for<br>
determining base sequences. The identified base sequence<br>
is shown as SEQ ID NO: 3, while the amino acid sequence<br>
translated from the base sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO: 4.<br>
The present enzyme has subunits of molecular weight of<br>
approximately 26,000 and its activity is known to be expressed<br>
in the form of hexamer. The enzyme has the optimum temperature<br>
of about 70°C and the optimum pH range of about 7.0 to 7.5.<br>
The transformant thus obtained was named Escherichia coli<br>
MT-10905.<br>
Escherichia coli strain MT-10905 was shake cultured in<br>
100 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of Am at 37°C overnight.<br>
The culture was centrif uged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. to obtain<br>
the cell mass, which was then suspended in 20 ml of 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0). The suspension was<br>
centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. to obtain the<br>
cell mass, which was then suspended in 2 ml of 100 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1-phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA), and frozen and stored at -20°C.<br>
Escherichia coli DH5awas transf ormedusingplasmidpUC18<br>
(from Takara Shuzo). This transformant strain was named<br>
pUC18/DH5a. The strain pUC18/DH5a was shake cultured in 100<br>
ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of Am at 37°C overnight.<br>
The culture was centrif uged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. to obtain<br>
the cell mass, which was then suspended in 20 ml of 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0). The suspension was<br>
centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. to obtain the<br><br>
cell mass, which was then suspended in 2 ml of 100 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1-phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA), and frozen and stored at -20°C.<br>
Comparative Example 1: (synthesis of deoxycytidine by<br><br>

A reaction solution with 1.0 ml by volume consisting<br>
of 20 mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate<br>
di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by SIGMA), 20 mM<br>
cytosine (produced by Wako Pure Chemicals, guaranteed grade),<br>
100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the<br>
cell mass suspension of the strain pUC18/DH5α obtained in<br>
Reference Example 2 was treated at 50°C for 20 hours . Another<br>
solution of the same composition except the absence of the<br>
substrates was heat treated similarly and then used as<br>
comparative example. When the reaction solution was diluted<br>
and then analyzed, deoxycytidine could not be detected. The<br>
analysis chart from HPLC of the treated solution for the<br>
comparative example is shown in FIG. 1A, and the corresponding<br>
chart of the treated reaction solution in FIG. 1B.<br>
Comparative Example 2: (synthesis of deoxycytidine by<br>
 the PNP non recombinant E. coli)<br>
A reaction solution with 1.0 ml by volume consisting<br>
of 20 mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate<br>
di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by SIGMA), 20 mM<br>
cytosine (produced by Wako Pure Chemicals, guaranteed grade),<br>
100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the<br>
cell mass suspension of the strain MT-10905 obtained in<br><br>
Reference Example 2 was treated at 50°C for 20 hours. Another<br>
solution of the same composition except the absence of the<br>
substrates was heat treated similarly and then used as<br>
comparative example. When the reaction solution was diluted<br>
and then analyzed, 10 mM deoxyuridine and 3 mM uracil were<br>
produced, but deoxycytidine could not be detected. The<br>
analysis chart from HPLC of the treated solution for the<br>
comparative example is shown in FIG. 2A, and the corresponding<br>
chart of the treated reaction solution in FIG. 2B.<br>
Example 1: (processing with organic solvent)<br>
To the cell mass suspension of the strain MT-10905<br>
obtained in Reference Example 2 was added a certain amount<br>
of methanol so as to attain any one of the methanol<br>
concentrations listed in Table 2, and then the suspension<br>
was kept at 30°C for 1 hour. Cytidine deaminase will be<br>
expressed as cdd hereafter. The activity of cdd was analyzed<br>
after the cell mass suspension was added to 1.0 ml of the<br>
reaction solution consisting of 100 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 8.0) and 20 mM cytidine, and then treated at 50°C<br>
for 2 hours.<br>
The cell mass suspension described above was kept at<br>
30°C for 1 hour without addition of methanol, and then the<br>
activity of cdd of the suspension was set at 100% of relative<br>
value.<br>
The activity of PNP was analyzed after the cell mass<br>
suspension was added to 1.0 ml of the reaction solution<br>
consisting of 20 mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate<br>
di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by SIGMA) , 5 . 4 mM<br><br>
adenine (produced by Wako Pure Chemicals, guaranteed grade)<br>
and 100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) , and then treated<br>
at 50°C for 15 minutes . The above reaction was conducted using<br>
such an amount of the cell mass as to produce not more than<br>
2 mM deoxyadenosine. The cell mass suspension described above<br>
was kept at 30°C for 1 hour without addition of methanol,<br>
and then the activity of PNP of the suspension was set at<br>
100% of relative value. The results shown in Table 2 reveal<br>
that the activity of PNP was reduced minimally, but the activity<br>
of cdd was eliminated nearly completely.<br><br>
Example 2: (processing with organic solvents)<br>
To the cell mass suspension of the strain MT-10905<br>
obtained in Reference Example 2 was added any one of the organic<br>
solvents as shown in Table 3, and then the suspension was<br>
kept at 30°C for 1 hour.<br>
The results shown in Table 3 reveal that the activity<br>
of PNP was reduced minimally, but the activity of cdd was<br>
eliminated nearly completely.<br><br><br>
Example 3: (heat treatment)<br>
The cell mass suspension of the strain MT-10905 obtained<br>
in Reference Example 2 was kept at 60°C. Cytosine deaminase<br>
will be expressed as cod hereafter. The activity of cod was<br>
analyzed after the cell mass suspension was added to 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 20 mM cytosine, and<br>
then treated at 50°C for 2 hours. The cod activity of the<br>
cell mass suspension that was not heat treated was set at<br>
100% and the remaining activities were expressed with relative<br>
values. The results shown in Table 4 reveal that the activity<br>
of PNP was reduced minimally, but the activity of cod was<br>
eliminated nearly completely.<br><br><br>
Example 4: (heat treatment plus processing with organic<br>
solvent)<br>
The cell mass suspension heat treated for 20 hours in<br>
Example 3 was processed with methanol in the same way as in<br>
Example 1. The individual activities of the cell mass<br>
suspension that was heat treated for 20 hours in Example 3<br>
were set at 100% and the remaining activities were expressed<br>
with relative values. The results shown in Table 5 reveal<br>
that the activity of PNP was reduced minimally, but the<br>
activities of both cod and cdd were eliminated nearly<br>
completely.<br><br>
Example 5: (synthesis of deoxycytidine by the recombinant<br>
bacterium expressing PNP and treated as in Example 4)<br>
1.0 ml of the reaction solution consisting of 20 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1 -phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA), 20 mM cytosine (produced by Wako Pure<br>
Chemicals, guaranteed grade), 100 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 8. 0) and 0.1 ml of the cell mass suspension processed<br>
with 50% methanol in Example 4 was treated at 50°C for 20<br>
hours. When the reaction solution was diluted and then<br><br>
analyzed, 10 . 7 mM deoxycytidine, 0 . 2 mM deoxyuridine and 0 .1<br>
mM uracil were produced. The reaction yield was then 53%.<br>

2' -deoxyribose-1-phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA) , 20 mM cytosine (produced by Wako Pure<br>
Chemicals, guaranteed grade), 100 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the cell mass suspension of<br>
pUC18/DH5α which was obtained in Reference Example 2 and<br>
processed with 50% methanol as in Example 4, was treated at<br>
50°C for 20 hours. When the reaction solution was diluted<br>
and then analyzed, 0.14 mM deoxycytidine and 0.17 mM<br>
deoxyuridine were produced. The reaction yield was then 0.7%.<br>

SIGMA), 20 mM cytosine (produced by Wako Pure Chemicals,<br>
guaranteed grade) , 100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0)<br>
and 0.1 ml of the cell mass suspension processed with 50%<br>
methanol in Example 4 was treated at 50°C for 20 hours. When<br>
the reaction solution was diluted and then analyzed, 5 mM<br><br>
cytidine, 0.1 mM uridine and 0.1 mM uracil were produced.<br>
The reaction yield was then 25%.<br>
Example 8: (purification of PNP and synthesis of<br>
deoxycytidine by the purified PNP)<br>
The cell mass obtained in Example 4 was suspended in<br>
10 ml of 10 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7 . 5) and disrupted<br>
with an ultrasonic disrupter. The disrupted cell suspension<br>
was then centrifuged to obtain a crude enzyme solution, which<br>
was then added onto a column loaded with DEAE-Toyopearl (3cm<br>
x 10cm: from Toso) that was equilibrated with 50 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.5) and then eluted with a linear<br>
gradient of 50 mMNaCl to 500 mMNaCl to recover active fractions.<br>
The eluate was saturated with 70% aqueous ammonium sulfate<br>
to form precipitate, which was then dialyzed against 10 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.5). The dialyzed solution<br>
was added onto a column loaded with hydroxyapatite (3 cm x<br>
15 cm) that was equilibrated with 10 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 7.5) and then eluted with a gradient of 10 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.5) to 50 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 7.5) to recover active fractions. The enzyme<br>
solution was saturated with 70% aqueous ammonium sulfate to<br>
form and recover precipitate, which was then dissolved in<br>
1	ml of 10 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.5) and dialyzed<br>
against 10 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.5) to obtain<br>
2	ml of purified PNP. The purified PNP thus obtained was<br>
found to form a single band in electrophoresis using a<br>
SDS-polyacrylamide system. The result is shown in FIG. 3.<br><br>
1.0 ml of the reaction solution consisting of 20 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1-phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA), 20 mM cytosine (produced by Wako Pure<br>
Chemicals, guaranteed grade), 100 mM tris hydrochloride<br>
buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the purified PNP was treated<br>
at 50°C for 20 hours. When the reaction solution was diluted<br>
and then analyzed, 11.5 mM deoxycytidine was produced and<br>
the reaction yield was then 57.5%.<br>
Example 9: (synthesis of azacytidine by the recombinant<br>
bacterium expressing PNP and treated as in Example 4)<br>
1.0 ml of the reaction solution consisting of 20 mM<br>
ribose-1-phosphate di(cyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by<br>
SIGMA), 20 mM azacytosine (produced by SIGMA), 100 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the cell mass<br>
suspension processed with 50% methanol in Example 4 was treated<br>
at 50°C for 20 hours. When the reaction solution was diluted<br>
and then analyzed, 3.2 mM azacytidine was produced. The<br>
reaction yield was then 16%.<br>
Example 10: (synthesis of fluorocytidine by the<br>
recombinant bacterium expressing PNP and treated as in Example<br>
4)<br>
1.0 ml of the reaction solution consisting of 20 mM<br>
ribose-1 -phosphate di(cyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by<br>
SIGMA), 20 mM 5-fluorocytosine (produced by SIGMA), 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the cell<br>
mass suspension processed with 50% methanol in Example 4 was<br>
treated at 50°C for 20 hours. When the reaction solution was<br><br>
diluted and then analyzed, 2.4 mM 5-fluorocytidine was<br>
produced. The reaction yield was then 12%.<br>
Example 11: (synthesis of methylcytidine by the<br>
recombinant bacterium expressing PNP and treated as in Example<br>

1.0 ml of the reaction solution consisting of 20 mM<br>
ribose-1 -phosphate di(cyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by<br>
SIGMA), 20 mM 5-methylcytosine (produced by SIGMA), 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 ml of the cell<br>
mass suspension processed with 50% methanol in Example 4 was<br>
treated at 50°C for 20 hours. When the reaction solution was<br>
diluted and then analyzed, 2.1 mM 5-methylcytidine was<br>
produced. The reaction yield was then 10.5%.<br>
Example 12: (synthesis of deoxycytidine by bacterial<br>
mass devoid of degrading activity with PNP incorporated)<br>
(1) Creation of Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis<br>
shuttle vectors pPNP04 and pPNP05 for expressing E. coli PNP<br>
in B. subtilis<br>
The PCR using pUC-PNP73 as template and the synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide primer of SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 allowed the<br>
gene for purine nucleoside phosphorylase of Escherichia coli<br>
to be amplified, resulting in production of 0 . 8 kb DNA fragment<br>
A. Then, by the PCR which used pNP150 (FERMBP-425) described<br>
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 60-210986 as template and<br>
the synthetic oligonucleotide primer of SEQ ID NOs: 7 and<br>
8, the region including the transcription promoter and<br>
translation regulating site derived from the neutral protease<br>
of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was amplified, resulting in<br><br>
production of l.o kb DNA fragment B. Then, annealing was<br>
carried out using overlapping regions of DNA fragments A and<br>
B. The PCR using the resulting fragment as template and the<br>
synthetic oligonucleotide primer of SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 7 allowed<br>
approximately 1.8 kb DNA fragment C to be produced via<br>
amplification. This DNA fragment C was digested by the<br>
restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII to produce insert<br>
fragments. Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle<br>
vectors pRB373 and pRB374 were received from Bacillus Genetic<br>
Stock Center (BGSC; OH) and then each digested by the<br>
restriction enzymes EcoRI and Hindlll to prepare vector<br>
fragments. The vector fragments were ligated in the presence<br>
of an excessive amount of the above insert fragments to create<br>
shuttle vectors pPNP04 and pPNP05 expressing the purine<br>
nucleoside phosphorylase of E. coli.<br>
(2) Entry of pPNP04 and pPNPOS into Bacillus subtilis,<br>
and synthesis of deoxycytidine using the transformant<br>
Bacillus subtilis strains 1A479 and 1A480, both devoid<br>
of cytidine deaminase activity, were received from Bacillus<br>
Genetic Stock Center (BGSC; OH).<br>
Transformation with plasmids pPNP04 and pPNP05 obtained<br>
in procedure (1) was conducted according to the protoplast<br>
method by Chang (Chang. S. and Cohen, S. N.; Mol. Gen. Genet.<br>
168, 111 (1978)) to obtain transformants 1A480 (pPNP04), 1A480<br>
(pPNP05), 1A479 (pPNP04) and 1A479 (pPNP05).<br>
Then, the strain 1A480 (pPNP04) was evaluated for<br>
activity of deoxycytidine synthesis as follows:<br><br>
The strain 1A480 (pPNP04) was cultured in 20 ml of the<br>
L medium of two-fold concentration at 35°C for 17 hours. 1.5<br>
ml of the culture was centrifuged to obtain the cell mass,<br>
which was then frozen and stored at -20°C. 1.0 ml of a reaction<br>
solution consisting of 24 mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate<br>
di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt (produced by SIGMA), 20 mM<br>
cytosine (produced by Wako Pure Chemicals , guaranteed grade)<br>
and 100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) was added to<br>
0.1 ml of the frozen cell mass and shaken at 50°C. The solution<br>
was sampled 1. 5 hours and 18 hours after the start. The samples<br>
were diluted with water by 20 fold and centrifuged to remove<br>
the cell mass. The supernatants thereof were analyzed by<br>
HPLC to reveal that accumulation of deoxycytidine was from<br>
1.4 to 1.5 mM after 1.5 hours and from 6.4 to 7.0 mM after<br>
18 hours, while no degradation of either the substrates or<br>
the product was detected.<br>
Analysis of deoxycytidine synthesis by the strains 1A480<br>
(pPNP05). 1A479 (pPNP04) and 1A479 (pPNP05) revealed that<br>
they were as effective as the strain 1A480 (pPNP04) for<br>
deoxycytidine synthesis.<br>
Example 13: (obtainment of enzymes substituted by an<br>
amino acid but keeping cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase<br>
activity)<br>
Mutagenesis was introduced using the plasmid DNA of<br>
pUC-PNP73 obtained in Reference Example 2 as template and<br>
Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from STRATAGENE,<br>
which will be referred to simply as Kit hereafter. The<br><br>
examples below basically followed the principle and procedure<br>
of the Kit.<br>
10 ml of a LB liquid medium was prepared in a 30-ml test<br>
tube and then sterilized in an autoclave at 121°C for 20 minutes .<br>
A certain amount of ampicillin was added to the medium so<br>
as to set its final concentration at 100 μg/ml. The strain<br>
MT-10905 obtained in Reference Example 2 was seeded by a loop<br>
of the cell mass and then cultured at 37°C and 300 rpm for<br>
about 20 hours. Then, 1 -ml aliquot s of the culture were poured<br>
into any suitable centrifuge tubes to separate the cell mass<br>
by centrifugation (at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes) . After that,<br>
the plasmid DNA of pUC-PNP73 was prepared from the cell mass<br>
by the alkaline SDS extraction.<br>
The PCR was carried out using the plasmid DNA of pUC-PNP73<br>
as template, and the respective DNAs of SEQ ID NOs: 9 and<br>
10, 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, 19 and 20,<br>
21 and 22, 23 and 24, 25 and 26, 27 and 28, 29 and 30, 31<br>
and 32, 33 and 34, 35 and 36, 37 and 38, 39 and 40, 41 and<br>
42, 43 and 44, and 45 and 46 as primers. The composition<br>
of the PCR medium is shown in Table 6. The conditions of<br>
amplification are shown in Table 7.<br>
The restriction enzyme DpnI was added to the above PCR<br>
medium by 4 units and maintained at 37°C for 1 hour. 1 μl<br>
of the reaction medium was added to 100 μl of the competent<br>
cells (from Toyobo) of E. coli K-12DH5α, and maintained in<br>
ice for 30 minutes. Then, the cell suspension was immersed<br>
in a thermostatic water bath at 42°C for 30 seconds. 0.9 ml<br>
of the NZY+ medium, which is an accessory to the competent<br><br>
cells, was added to the cell suspension and shaken at 37°C<br>
for 1 hour.<br>
The above culture was smeared onto LB agar medium where<br>
a certain amount of ampicillin had been added so as to set<br>
its final concentration at 100 μg/ml, and then maintained<br>
at 37°C for 20 hours to form colonies.<br>
Five clones were arbitrarily selected from the colonies,<br>
seeded by a loop of each cell mass in 100ml of LB medium<br>
containing 50 μg/ml of Am and shake cultured at 37°C overnight.<br>
The culture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes to<br>
obtain the cell mass, which was then suspended in 20 ml of<br>
100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0). The suspension<br>
was centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain<br>
the cell mass, which was then suspended in 2 ml of 100 mM<br>
tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1 -phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA) , processed as in Example 4 and subjected<br>
to the reaction for deoxycytidine synthesis as in Example<br>
5. Analysis of deoxycytidine by HPLC revealed that four of<br>
the five clones produced deoxycytidine, thus holding the<br>
activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase.<br>
The cell mass of each of the above four clones was separated<br>
from 1 ml of the above culture remaining after analysis of<br>
the activity of cytosine nucleoside phosphorylase. The<br>
plasmid DNA of each of the four clones was prepared from the<br>
cell mass by alkaline SDS extraction. The base sequences<br>
of the DNA fragments were identified by the common method<br>
for determining base sequences . Enzyme activity was measured<br><br><br><br><br>
Reference Example 3: (Transformation of Escherichia coli<br>
strain K-12 W3110)<br>
Escherichia coli strain K-12 W3110 (ATCC27325) was<br>
transformed with the plasmid pUC-PNP73 obtained in Reference<br>
Example 2 according to the common procedure. The transf ormant<br>
thus obtained was named MT-10948 . When the transf ormant was<br>
cultured as in Reference Example 2, it was twice as active<br><br>
as the corresponding transf ormant of Escherichia coli strain<br>
K-12 DH5α.<br>
Example 14: (removal of reaction inhibitors through<br>
precipitation with polar solvent)<br>
The cell mass of the strain MT-10948 cultured as in<br>
Reference Example 2 was disrupted with an ultrasonic disrupter.<br>
The same volume of acetone as the disruption fluid was added<br>
to the fluid, which was then centrifuged to remove the<br>
precipitate.<br>
Then, a half volume of acetone compared to the above<br>
was added to the above supernatant formed by centrifugation<br>
and centrifuged to recover the precipitate.<br>
The recovered precipitate was dried up in a vacuum dryer.<br>
The dried precipitate was dissolved in 2 ml of 100 mM tris<br>
hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 mM<br>
2' -deoxyribose-1 -phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt<br>
(produced by SIGMA) and then processed as in Example 4. A<br>
2-ml solution of the enzyme fractionated with acetone was<br>
added to water (105.3 g) together with cytosine (6.96 g),<br>
2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate diammonium salt (18.7 g) and<br>
magnesium hydroxide (6.2 g), and the reaction took place at<br>
50°C for 24 hours. The HPLC analysis after the reaction<br>
demonstrated that 11.4 g (80%) of 2'-deoxycytidine was<br>
produced. For comparison, a 2-ml fluid containing disrupted<br>
cell mass before addition of acetone was similarly subjected<br>
to the reaction. As a result, 8 . 5 g (60%) of 2 ' -deoxycytidine<br>
was produced.<br><br>
Example 15: (removal of reaction inhibitors through<br>
precipitation with ammonium sulfate)<br>
The cell mass of the strain MT-10948 cultured as in<br>
Reference Example 2 was disrupted with an ultrasonic<br>
disrupter.<br>
Ground pieces of ammonium sulfate were slowly added to<br>
the disruption fluid so as to attain 40% saturation finally.<br>
The fluid was slowly agitated in ice for 1 hour and centrifuged<br>
to remove the precipitate. Similarly, ground pieces of<br>
ammonium sulfate were added to the supernatant formed by<br>
centrifugation so as to attain 70% saturation finally. The<br>
fluid was slowly agitated in ice for 1 hour and centrifuged<br>
to obtain the precipitate. The precipitate was then dissolved<br>
in 2 ml of 100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 8.0) and 10<br>
mM 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate di(monocyclohexylammonium)<br>
salt (produced by SIGMA) . The solution was processed as in<br>
Example 4 and subjected to the reaction for deoxycytidine<br>
synthesis as in Example 14. As a result, 11.0 g (80%) of<br>
2'-deoxycytidine was produced.<br>
Example 16: (removal of reaction inhibitors: purified<br>
enzyme in Example 8)<br>
A 2-ml solution of the enzyme obtained as in Example<br>
8 was subjected to the reaction for deoxycytidine synthesis<br>
as in Example 14 . As a result, 11. 0 g ( 80% ) of 2 ' -deoxycytidine<br>
was produced.<br>
Example 17: (the effect of a phoA deficient strain)<br>
A 2-ml suspension of the cell mass obtained in Example<br>
4 was subjected to the same reaction as in Example 14. As<br><br>
a result, 11.0 g (80%) of 2'-deoxycytidine was produced. On<br>
the other hand, when the strain MT-10948 was processed as<br>
in Example 4, this strain was twice as high as the strain<br>
MT-10905 for activity. However, when this strain was<br>
subjected to the same reaction as in Example 14, only 8.5<br>
g (60%) of 2'-deoxycytidine was produced.<br>
Example 18<br>
To the mixture of water (96.4 g) and 4 .8 g of cyclohexane,<br>
were added 6.96 g (62.6 mmol) of cytosine, 18.7 g (75.4 mmol)<br>
of 2'-deoxyribose-1-phosphate diammonium salt, 7.58 g (132<br>
mmol) of magnesium hydroxide and the frozen cell mass (2.0<br>
g) prepared in Reference Example 3. The reaction took place<br>
at 45°C for 18 hours, controlling the solution at pH 8.8 with<br>
acetic acid. The HPLC analysis after the reaction<br>
demonstrated that 10.03 g (70.5 mol%/cytosine) of<br>
2'-deoxycytidine was produced as object compound. At the<br>
same time, 0.73 g (10.4 mol%/cytosine) of uracil and 1.80<br>
g (12.6 mol%/cytosine) of 2'-deoxyuridine were produced as<br>
byproduct, respectively.<br>
Example 19<br>
Synthesis of 2' -deoxycytidine was carried out under the<br>
same conditions as in Example 18, except that the solvent<br>
for processing the cell mass and/or the solvent added for<br>
the reaction were different. The results are shown in Tables<br>
9 and 10.<br><br><br>
Example 20: Synthesis of 2'-deoxycytidine<br>
To 20 g of pure water were added 20 ml (total exchange<br>
capacity 24 mmol) of strongly basic anionic exchange resin<br>
(Levatit MP500 : exchange capacity 1.1 eq/L) and<br>
2-deoxyribose-l-phosphate diammonium salt (4.96 g, 20 mmol),<br>
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes .<br>
Then, enzyme solution (0 . 5 ml) , prepared according to Example<br>
4, and cytosine (2.11 g, 19 mmol) were added to the mixture,<br>
which was stirred at 50°C for 10 hours. Analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture by HPLC revealed that 2 ' -deoxycytidine, the<br>
desired product was produced in the yield of 80%.<br><br>
Production of a nucleoside compound using a nucleoside<br>
phosphorylase may be conducted both regiospecifically and<br>
stereospecifically under mild conditions. It is thus hoped<br>
that an industrial method of production will be established,<br>
but it is not attained yet. The present invention provides<br>
a method for producing a cytosine nucleoside compound from<br>
pentose-1-phosphate and cytosine or a derivative thereof<br>
using a nucleoside phosphorylase reactive to cytosine. The<br>
invention also provides a method for specifically reducing<br>
an activity to degrade the substrates or the product, resulting<br>
in efficient production of the cytosine nucleoside compound.<br><br>
