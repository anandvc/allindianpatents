Title of the invention<br>
TOWEL ETTE PRODUCT<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br>
TOWELETTE PRODUCT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to single use towelettes for cosmetically delivering alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids.<br>
The Related Art<br>
AlphA-hydroxycarboxylic acids and their derivatives are widely known as pxovidmg treatment for the maintenance of a youthful, look. These substances are said to control the development of facial fine lines and wrinkles. However, formulation of these substances has been difficult. Among the problems that have been encountered are compatibility with carrier systems, physical stability and skin irritation. In addition, it is particularly difficult to fomulate low pH systems.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,091,171 (Yu et al.) was one of the first documents to describe the use of alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids as being effective against the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Subsequent thereto a vast amount of literature and many commercial products have been generated based on the efficacy of these materials. Most of the formulations described to date have been of either the cream or lotion type. One problem with these formulations is that they do not always evenly distribute over the applied surfaces.   Secondly, any time an active<br>
2<br><br>
treated surface is followed by cleansing, the active is washed away. Hence, methods of maintaining alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids on a skin surface are needed which are not susceptible to subsequent cleansing actions. Irritation has also been of great concern because the formulations generally have a low pH.<br>
WO 96/11572 (Moberg) has utilised a variety of acids, including the alpha-hydroxy substance known as lactic acid, in an aqueous hexylene glycol formulation which can be impregnated onto textiles or refreshing napkins. These were employed in order to overcome the problem of microbial growth on skin and also act as a disinfectant.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,828,912 (Hossain et al.) and U.S. Patent 4,764,418 (Kuenn et al.) describe virucidal tissue products directed at controlling disease inducing organisms such as viruses and the common cold. Carboxylic acids such as citric, malic, succinic and benzoic acids are formulated with surfactants and a carrier for impregnation onto facial tissues or other non-woven materials.<br>
None of the above disclosures have addressed the, issue of stickiness of the alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids once they have been deposited onto the skin by the towelette. Neither has mere been any discussion with respect to odour control which may arise in low pH systems.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a product and a method for both cleansing skin and reducing the signs of aging.<br><br>
i<br><br>
3<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a product and a method for depositing alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids in a manner which avoids the formation of sticky residues on the skin.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a product for delivering alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids in a formulation which avoids the formation of foul odours.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more apparent from the following summary and detailed discussion which follow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a towelette product which includes:<br>
(a)	a water-insoluble substrate;<br>
(b)	a cosmetic composition impregnated into the substrate including; (i)        an alpha-or beta-hydroxycarboxylic acid;<br>
(ii)        a silicon microemulsion;<br>
(iii)        the composition in water having a pH of no higher than about 6.5.<br>
Silicone microemulsions of the present invention provide both stability to the composition and counteract any stickiness which may occur when the alpha-hydroxycarboxyulic acids are deposited onto the skin.<br>
4<br><br>
Surfactants, especially mild surfactants such as those of the amphoteric type may decompose at low pH emitting foul odours. The silicone microemulsions of the present invention have also been found to be useful in counteracting the generation of foul odours.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The applicants have now surprisingly found that towelettes impregnated with alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids can be delivered to the skin without imparting any stickiness. This is achieved by the use of silicone microemulsions.<br>
Typically creams, lotions and other types of cosmetic vehicles containing the aipha-hydroxycarboxylic acids also contain emollients which are deposited on the skin along with the other actives. These emollients include, for example, esters, hydrocarbons or dimethicone oils. The presence of the emollients obscures any stickiness which may result from evaporation of water or the carrier leaving dried active behind.<br>
Unfortunately, towelette products cannot be impregnated with fluids with too high viscosity as the towelettes will not adequately wet out when the fluid to be impregnated is too thick. However, low viscosity fluids which must be used with towelettes are susceptible to poor emulsion stability and large amounts of emollients are difficult to formulate into these systems. Consequently, actives such as alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids deposit in a<br>
5<br><br>
sticky manner onto skin from the low viscosity fluids spread thereon by the towelettes.<br>
A first necessary aspect of the present invention is that of a substrate. Preferably the substrate is a water insoluble substance. By "water insoluble" is meant that the substrate does not dissolve in or readily break -apart upon immersion in water. Another advantage of the substrate in combination with the active is that the former helps the active penetrate. The substrate is also much better than a mere liquid or gel formulation enaling for more accurate application to the skin and the avoidance of sensitive arcas, such as the eye where inadvertent application of the astringent composition would cause irritation.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as the substrate. The following non-limiting characteristics are desirable: (i) sufficient wet strength for use, (ii) sufficient abrasivity, (iii) sufficient loft and porosity, (iv) sufficient thickness, (v) appropriate size, and (vi) non-reactive with components of die impregnating composition.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of suitable substrates which meet the above criteria include nonwoven substrates, woven substrates, hydroentangled substrates, air entangled substrates and the like. Preferred embodiments employ nonwoven substrates since they are economical and readily available in a variety of materials. By "nonwoven" is meant that the layer is comprised of fibers which are not woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a sheet, particularly a tissue. The fibers can either be random (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. -combed to be oriented<br>
4<br><br>
in primarily one direction).   Furthermore, the nonwoven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Nonwoven substrates may be comprised of a variety of materials both naniral and synthetic. By namral is meant that the materials are derived from plants, animals, insects or byproducts. By synthetic is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any of the common synthetic or namral textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of .natural materials useful in the present invention axe silk: fibers, keratin fibers and cellulsie,fbers.-Nonlirmiting examples of keratin fibers include those selected from the grcup comprising wool fibers, camel hair fibers, and the like. Nonlimiting examples of cellulosic fibers include those selected from the group comprising wood pulp fibers, cotton fibers, hemp fibers, jute fibers, flax fibers, and mixtures thereof, wood pulp fibers are preferred while all cotton fibers (e.g. cotton pads) are normally avoided.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of synthetic materials useful in the present invention include those selected from the group comprising acetate fibers, acrylic fibers, cellulose ester fibers, modacrylic fibers, polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, rayon fibers and mixtures thereof.

For the purposes of the present invention the most preferred towellettes are non-woven substrates, especially blends of rayon/polyester in ratios of 10:90 to 90:10, preferably ratios of 20:80 TO 80:20, optimally 40:60 to 60:40 by weight. The most preferred towelette is a 70:30 rayon/polyester non-woven wipe article.<br>
The substrate can be made into a wide variety of shapes and forms. Generally the substrate is in single use towelette form. Advantageously, the towelettes are folded in a Z-shaped formation. They may be interleaved with one another but preferably are not interleaved. The Z- fold consists of a center panel flanked by upper and lower wing panels.<br>
9<br><br>
The upper and lower wing panels are substantially of equal width and substantially half a width of the center panel. Each towelette is folded medially in a direction orthogonal to that of the Z-shaped formation. Advantageously the size of the towelette may range in length from 10 to 40 cm, preferably from 15 to 30 cm, optimally from 18 to 24 cm. The width of the towelette may range from 8 to 30 cm, preferably from 10 to 25 cm, optimally from 15 to 20 cm.<br>
Anywhere from 5 to 100, preferably from 10 to 50 single towelettes may be stored within a dispensing pouch, preferably a moisture impermeable pouch. During storage and between dispensing, the pouch is resealable, usually via an adhesive strip covering a dispersing opening. Single towelette containing pouches may also be employed.<br>
The substrates of the present invention may optionally comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness: The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gende cleansing. In addition, separate layers of the substrate can be manufactured to have different colors, thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces.<br>
A second important element of me present invention is that of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid. By this term is meant not only the acid form but also salts mereof. Typical cationic counterions to form the salt are the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium, C2-C8 trialkanolammonium  cation and  mixtures  mereof.     The term   " alpha-<br>
10<br><br>
hydroxycarboxyIc acids" include not only hydroxyacids but also alpha-ketoacids and related compounds of polymeric forms of hydroxyacid.<br>
Alpha-hydroxyacids are organic carboxylic acids in which one hydroxyl group is attached to the alpha carbon adjacent the carboxy group. The generic structure is as follows:<br>
(Ra) (Rb) C (OH) COOH<br>
wherein Ra and Rb are independently an H, F, CI, Br, alky], aralkyl or an aryi group and saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isorneric, straight or branched chain or cyclic form, having 1 to 25 carbon atoms. In addition Ra and Rb may optionally be substituted by OH, CHO, COOH and alkoxy groups having 1 to 9 carbon atoms. The alpha-hydroxyacids may exist as stereoisomers as D, L, and DL forms when Ra and Rb are not identical.<br>
Typical alkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups for Ra and Rb include methyl, ediyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl, lauryl, stearyl, benzyl and phenyl, etc. The alpha-hydroxyacids of the first group may be sub¬divided into (1) alkyl alpha-hydroxyacids, (2) aralkyl and aryl alpha-hydroxyacids, (3) polyhydroxy alpha-hydroxyacids, and (4) polycarboxylic alpha-hydroxyacids.

0.8% by weight.	<br>
Low pH systems containing fatty acid (C10-C22 alkyl) groups such as lauroamphoacetates have been found to emit foul odours. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that hydrolysis of surfactants with fatry acid groups results in cleavage of these groups. Malodorous fatty acids are thereby formed. The applicants have surpisingly found mat silicone microemulsions such as dimethiconyl microemulsions effectively inhibit odour formation.<br><br>
These impregnating compositions of the present invention may involve a range of pH although it is preferred to have a relatively low pH, for instance, a pH from about 2 to about 6.5, preferably from about 2.5 to about 4.5.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this<br>
invention. All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in<br>
the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.	<br>
EXAMPLES; .1-8<br>
Table I provides a listing of formulations which are suitable for impregnation into a cellulosic substrate forming a towelette. The pH of the resulting composition solutions range from about 2.8 to about 4.0.<br>
22<br><br><br>
TABLE I<br><br>
23<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of silicones and ouier substances for stability and reducing stickiness in low pH hydroxy carboxylic acid depositing towelette products. Towelettes were impregnated with a formulation substantially similar to Example 1 except that the dimethiconor microemulsion was replaced with materials reported under Table II at the specified usage level. An amount of 4 grams formulation was impregnated into each towelette (1.8 gram weight; 6 inch by 8 inch size). Stability refers to the phase compatibility of the fluid which impregnated the towelettes. Ratings were "good" for homogeneous fluids, "fair, for those with only a small amount of top creaming, and "poor, for significant phase separation. Stickiness was evaluated by a trained evaluator and measured by sensory finger feel.<br>

Almost all the non-silicone materials had no beneficial effect on ameliorating stickiness of deposited hydroxycarboxylic acids. Dimethicone emulsions did work well^to remove stickiness. However, these emulsions imparted poor stability to the fluid formulations. Only dimethiconol microemulsions retained both good physical stability while also effectively combating stickiness.<br>
