				<td>EQUIPMENT FOR MECHANICAL MACHINING<br>
Technical scope<br>
This invention relates to equipment for mechanical machining, in particular for<br>
turning and drilling light alloy wheels.<br>
Technical background<br>
In the specific technical field of the manufacture of light alloy wheels, of<br>
aluminium alloy in particular, the mechanical machining which is mainly required<br>
on these metal parts comprises turning and drilling in accordance with<br>
predetermined working cycles.<br>
These working cycles generally comprise rather short cycle times, of the order of<br>
a few minutes, in which the effect of the time during which tools are moved<br>
(otherwise known as the "changeover time") and the time for loading/unloading<br>
the workpieces is rather substantial in comparison with the actual time for which<br>
the machine tools are working in the overall cycle time. By way of example it may<br>
be noted that this may amount to even 30% and more of the machining cycle<br>
time in the case of cycle times of the order of approximately 1 minute.<br>
It is also obvious that as the specified cycle times are reduced (as a result, for<br>
example, of reduced working times for the removal of turnings), because the<br>
changeover and loading/unloading times remain substantially unchanged this<br>
effect increases in proportion, penalising the overall productivity of the machining<br>
equipment.<br>
US 4,782,567 discloses a mechanical machining line comprising a wheel<br>
stocker.a wheel pick-up robot, a transfer device, a plurality of machining<br>
stations, a respective loading robot, each machine tool having a jig unit. Each of<br>
the first separate pick-up robot and plurality of loading robots is exclusively<br>
associated to the corresponding machining station. A main difference is that the<br>
present invention discloses a first and a second loading/unloading device which<br>
are incorporated in the equipment to move the workpieces towards and away<br>
from one or other of the machining unit. In other words, each loading/unloading<br>
device is guided along the machining units between a magazine (where the<br>
workpieces are picked up) and an opposite end station, where the machined<br>
workpieces are unloaded, each device being able to perform the<br>
loading/unloading movements in each of the machining areas.<br>
Another difference is that the turning unit of the present invention comprises a<br>
pair of chucks to support the workpieces being machined and respective turning<br>
heads designed to work in association with the corresponding chuck. The drilling<br>
unit also comprises a first and second workpiece holding means and respective<br>
drilling heads. Each machining unit is provided in such a way as to carry out<br>
corresponding separate machining operations in one working cycle on a<br>
workpiece supported on one of the holding means/chucks, while at the same<br>
time workpiece loading/unloading movements are being performed in relation to<br>
the other workpiece holding means/chucks.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
A principal object of the invention is to provide machining equipment which has<br>
been specially designed for the drilling and turning of light alloy wheels with<br>
characteristics which drastically reduce the effect of dead times, which are<br>
understood to be the times involved in accessory operations (changeover times<br>
and workpiece loading/unloading times), during which no mechanical machining<br>
with the removal of turnings takes place, in comparison with overall cycle times,<br>
with a consequent advantageous increase in the overall productivity of the<br>
equipment.<br>
This object and others which will appear below in the description are<br>
accomplished by equipment for mechanical machining constructed in accordance<br>
with the embodiments of the invention described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an equipment for mechanical<br>
machining, especially for turning and drilling mechanical workpieces, such as light<br>
alloy wheels and the like, characterized in that it comprises: at least one turning<br>

head designed to work alternately in association with one or other of the said<br>
chucks, at least one first workpiece loading/unloading device for moving the<br>
workpieces being machined to one or other of the said chucks so that workpieces<br>
are loaded/unloaded from one of the chucks at the same time as mechanical<br>
machining is being performed on the other chuck, at least one drilling unit<br>
operatively associated with the turning unit and having at least one first drilling<br>
head combined with at least one corresponding first workpiece-holding means, at<br>
least one second workpiece loading/unloading device for moving workpieces<br>
being machined in the said at least one drilling unit, the said first and second<br>
devices being further incorporated into the said equipment to move the<br>
workpieces undergoing machining towards and away from one or other of the<br>
said turning and drilling units so that mechanical machining in the drilling and<br>
turning units takes place at the same time as the operations of loading and<br>
unloading workpieces onto and from the equipment.<br>
The present invention further provides an equipment for mechanical machining,<br>
especially for turning and drilling mechanical workpieces, such as light alloy<br>
wheels and the like, characterized in that it comprises: at least oneturning unit<br>
with at least a pair of chucks to support the workpieces being. nqpchined and<br>
respective turning heads designed to work in association with the corresponding<br>
chuck, at least one first workpiece loading/unloading device for moving the<br>
workpieces being machined to one or other of the said chucks so that workpieces<br>
are loaded/unloaded from one of the chucks at the same time as mechanical<br>

and at least one second workpiece-holding means, the said first and second<br>
drilling heads being incorporated into the drilling unit in such a way as to carry out<br>
corresponding separate drilling operations in one working cycle on a workpiece<br>
supported on one of the said workpiece-holding means while at the same time<br>
workpiece loading/unloading movements are being performed in relation to the<br>
other workpiece-holding means. The drilling heads may be equipped with<br>
corresponding tool magazines so that during stages in which machining is carried<br>

Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the present invention will become clear<br>
from the following detailed description which is given with reference to the<br>
appended drawings which are provided purely by way of non-limiting example<br>
and in which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a diagrammatical front elevation view of mechanical machining<br>
equipment according to the invention,<br>
- Figure 2 is a diagrammatical view in plan of the equipment in Figure 1,<br>
- Figure 3 is a diagrammatical side elevation view of the equipment in the<br>
preceding figures.<br>
Preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
With reference to the figures mentioned, 1 indicates as a whole mechanical<br>
machining equipment for turning and drilling wheels 2 of especially<br>
aluminium alloy, constructed in accordance with this invention.<br>
Equipment 1 comprises a turning unit 3 combined with a drilling unit 4, the<br>
working areas of which are indicated by A and B respectively in Figure 2 (with a<br>
double dotted and dashed line).<br>
Turning unit 3 comprises a base 5 on which is provided a pair of chucks 6, 7<br>
with corresponding axes of rotation X, X" to support workpieces (wheels 2)<br>
undergoing machining and a turning head 8 designed to work irf association<br>
with one or other of chucks 6, 7 alternately. More particularly, head 8<br>
comprises an erect upright 9 from base 5 on which are provided guide and<br>
control means for a tool-holding slide 10 which can make guided movements<br>
away from and towards chucks 6, 7 along a direction parallel to an axis Y<br>
perpendicular to axes X, X" so that turning head 8 can work in the area of one<br>
or other of chucks 6, 7 alternately.<br>
Chucks 6, 7 are also served by a single, slide for rotation of the workpiece<br>
being machined. 11 indicates a first workpiece loading/unloading device, which<br>
forms part of a system for moving the workpieces and extends within working<br>
areas A and B through a magazine 12 from which wheels 2 requiring<br>
machining are taken and a station 13 for unloading machined wheels 2.<br>
Conveniently the movement system is constructed with vertical uprights 14<br>
which are designed to support a beam 15 lying above working units 3, 4 and<br>
incorporating guide means to guide device 11 in the corresponding working<br>
area. Beam 15 extends longitudinally between magazine 12 and unloading<br>
station 13.<br>
Device 11 comprises an arm 16 which can move transversely in the direction<br>
of movement of the device along beam 15, approaching/moving away from<br>
chucks 6, 7 for the operations of loading/unloading wheels 2 from turning unit<br>
3. Preferably arm lla has a handling device 17 at one end which is designed<br>
to seize wheels 2.<br>
Drilling unit 4, associated with working area B, is operatively associated with<br>
turning unit 3 and comprises a corresponding base 18 on which first and<br>
second workpiece-holding devices, indicated by 19 and 20 respectively, are<br>
located. Drilling unit 4 also comprise a pair of drilling heads 21, 22, each of<br>
which is provided with a corresponding tool-holding turret 21a, 22a capable of<br>
performing at least three working movements in three corresponding<br>
controlled axes and associated with a corresponding tool magazine, which is<br>
not shown. Heads 21, 22 are incorporated in drilling unit 4 so that either each<br>
can work with its corresponding workpiece-holding device or both can work on<br>
the same device in order in this second situation to carry out corresponding<br>
and separate drilling operations in one working cycle in which one head is<br>
being fitted with a tool to carry out subsequent drilling operations at the same<br>
time as the other drilling head is actively engaged iri"machining wheel 2.<br>
It is also provided that drilling heads 21, 22 are further incorporated into<br>
working unit 4 so as to carry out different drilling operations in one working<br>
cycle on a wheel 2 supported in one of devices 19, 20 at the same time as the<br>
workpiece is being loaded onto/unloaded from the other device.<br>
In this respect the equipment comprises a second workpiece loading/unloading<br>
device, indicated by 23, which is structurally and functionally identical to<br>
device 11, and correspondingly incorporates an arm 24 with a handling<br>
member 25 for grasping wheels 2. In the same way as in the case of device<br>
11, device 23 is guided along beam 15 to move the wheels in the operations of<br>
loading/unloading from workpiece-holding devices 19, 20 and taking wheels 2<br>
from magazine 12 and transferring them to the working area appropriate for<br>
turning operations, and vice versa.<br>
Conveniently devices 11, 23 are incorporated into equipment 1 for moving<br>
workpieces (wheels 2) which are being machined from and towards one or<br>
other of machining units 3, 4 so that the mechanical operations of drilling and<br>
turning take place at the same time as the operations of loading/unloading<br>
from the workpiece-holding devices and the chucks, and at the same time as<br>
the stages in which the machining heads are fitted.<br>
In operation, initially with reference to working area A in which turning is<br>
performed, it is provided that while turnings are being removed from the<br>
wheel supported in one of chucks 6, 7 a workpiece is loaded onto and<br>
unloaded from the other chuck at the same time using device 11. In this way<br>
the stages of acceleration/deceleration of one of the chucks before and after<br>
the stages of tool fitting takes place in a concealed time during which turnings<br>
are at the same time removed from the piece gripped in the other chuck. It<br>
follows that chucks 6, 7 are not therefore substantially.affected by dead times,<br>
by which times, are meant the times required for loading/unloading<br>
workpieces, the times for accelerating/decelerating the chuck and the times<br>
for changing tools.<br>
Similarly, with reference to working area B where drilling is performed, drilling<br>
operations are carried out on a wheel secured on one of devices 19, 20 while a<br>
machined workpiece is at the same time loaded onto/unloaded from the other<br>
device 19, 20 using means 11, 23. Again in this case therefore dead times are<br>
concealed in that the loading/unloading and tool-fitting times for one device<br>
are at the same time effective machining time with the removal of turnings for<br>
the other device. It is provided that the drilling operations in one cycle are<br>
performed by only one of the two drilling heads or both. In the latter case,<br>
while one of heads 19, 20 performs the drilling operation, the other head is<br>
fitted with a new tool so that it can perform the next drilling operation.<br>
When both heads 19, 20 complete the drilling operation specified in the<br>
working cycle, they are moved in the direction of the adjacent workpiece-<br>
holding device in order to carry out a further machining cycle.<br>
It will be noted that in equipment 1 workpieces can be machined with<br>
appropriate checks first in turning unit 3 and then in drilling unit 4 or vice<br>
versa, the machining heads and the loading/unloading devices being designed<br>
to work in both ways indicated.<br>
It will also be noted that the use of two drilling heads incorporated into<br>
machining unit 4 makes it possible to use tool-changing mechanisms of a<br>
substantially simple type with every advantage in ease of handling and control<br>
of the machining unit<br>
The invention thus achieves the objects specified, providing many advantages<br>
in comparison with known solutions.<br>
Firstly, the equipment according to the invention makes possible a substantial<br>
reduction in dead times during the working cycle, in the meaning of the term<br>
indicated above, with an advantageous increase in productivity in comparison<br>
with known applications.<br>
In particular the equipment according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
achieve a drastic reduction in the effect of loading/unloading times and the<br>
time for tool fitting and movement of the tool/workpiece-holding table within<br>
the overall cycle time so that cycle times are not governed by these accessory<br>
operations in relation to the actual time for the removal of turnings specified in<br>
the working cycle.<br>
Furthermore, as a result of the features of the equipment according to the<br>
invention, the machine tools provided in the machining units are not subjected<br>
to machine shutdowns for operations other than actual machining operations<br>
with the removal of turnings, with a consequent maximisation of productivity.<br>
