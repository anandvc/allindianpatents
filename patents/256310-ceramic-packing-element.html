				<td>IMPROVED CERAMIC PACKING ELEMENT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to packing elements of the type that are often called "random" or "dumped" packings. Such packings are used to fill towers units in which mass or heat transfer processes occur.	A particularly<br>
important application is the use of such ceramic elements in heat recovery operations where it is necessary to provide maximum effective contact with hot fluids passing through the reactor. Another key factor in maximizing efficiency is the maintenance of as low a pressure difference between top . and bottom of .the tower as possible. To ensure this the packing elements should present the minimum resistance to flow. This is promoted by very open structures but open structure alone is of limited use if the elements in the tower nest together such that parts of one packing element penetrate within the space of a second element. It is therefore important that the design of the elements minimize the tendency of the elements to nest together.<br>
The present invention relates particularly to ceramic packing elements that are produced by an extrusion or a dry-pressing process and hence have an essentially uniform cross-section along one axial direction which provides an axis of symmetry for the element. Several such shapes have been described in the art ranging from the very simple to the complex. All are based on an essentially cylindrical shape and differ basically in the internal structure within the cylindrical shape. The simplest structure is a basic<br>
cylinder with no internal structure at all. This type of structure is often called a Raschig ring and has been known for many years. At the other end of the complexity scale are the structures described in US Design Patent 455,029 and USP 6,007,915. Between the extremes there are simple wagon-wheel shapes such as are described in USPP 3,907,710 and 4,510,263.<br>
It has now discovered that the dimensions of these shapes are critical to achieving optimum performance and the range of dimensions for such optimum performance has not been taught in the prior art. USP 4,510,263 teaches L:D ratios of 0.5 to 5 but indicates that preferred ratios are from 0.5 to 2. In USP 3,907,710 there is no teaching on the aspect ratio but the Examples use elements with the ratio of 1. USP 4,337,178 which teaches cylindrical ceramic elements as catalyst supports, also does not teach specific preferred aspect ratios but utilizes in the Examples elements with aspect ratios of 2.11.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a ceramic packing element is provided. The packing element includes an essentially cylindrical structure with an axis of symmetry in a direction defining the length (L) of the element and a greatest dimension (D) perpendicular to the length defining the diameter of the element in which the ratio of the diameter to the length is from 2.7 to 4.5. The essentially cylindrical structure has a polygonal cross-section having six sides in which the element is provided with a plurality of internal septa defining a plurality of identical passages through the element, each of which has a triangular cross-section.<br>
In one embodiment, the ratio of the diameter to the length may be from 3.0 to 4.4. <br>

Figure 4 is a graph of the percentage thermal recovery against gas flow rate.<br>
Figure 5 is a top view of an element with an axially located larger channel.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiment<br>
The invention is now more particularly described with reference to the embodiment illustrated in the Drawings. This is not intended to imply any necessary limitations in the scope of the invention because it will be readily appreciated that many minor variations could be made without departing from the essential spirit of the invention.<br>
A ceramic packing. element is defined as having a containing structure that is essentially cylindrical in shape and this is understood to include shapes in which a round cylindrical shape has been somewhat flattened to create an oval cross-section as well as polygonal shapes with at least five sides. The space within the containing structure can have a plurality of septa or none but since a primary application is in the field of heat transfer in which surface area becomes very significant, it is preferred that significant internal structures are provided. In the context of this invention the term "septum" (plural "septa") is used to describe structural member connecting one interior part of the cylindrical containing structure with another. It therefore includes structures with lengths up to and including diameters.<br>
The ceramic elements of the invention can be formed from any suitable ceramic material such natural or synthetic clays, zeolites, cordierites, aluminas, zirconia, silica or mixtures of these. The formulation can be mixed with bonding agents, extrusion aids, pore formers, lubricants and the like to assist in the extrusion process and/or to generate the desired porosity or surface area for the intended application.<br>
The elements can be used in heat and mass transfer applications or as bases upon which catalytic components are deposited. The elements are particularly suitable for heat transfer applications involving heat recovery from streams of hot gases. An example of such an application is found in thermal regenerators attached to plants whose function is to burn off any combustible material from a waste gas stream. In such regenerators it is vital for efficient operation that the heat values from the exhaust gas stream be used to heat up the incoming waste gas to be treated so as to minimize the cost of fuel required to burn off the combustible material. The present invention teaches a way to optimize the element design to achieve this end.<br>
Mass transfer applications include the transfer of mass in the form of one or more components between a fluid and the ceramic elements, such as the removal of gas components, such as sulfur dioxide, from a flowing gas stream. An important mass transfer application of the ceramic elements is in sulfuric acid plant absorbers.<br>
The elements can however be used with advantage in any application in which the surface area is an important factor in determining the efficiency with which the elements perform their assigned task.<br>
In some cases in which the element has internal septa subdividing the space within the element into a plurality of channels it is advantageous to provide that the element has an axially located aperture. This can be of any desired shape but to avoid excessive disruption of the septa structure it can be the result of removing septa separating some of the channels to form a larger combined channel.<br>
A particularly preferred structure according to the invention comprises a containing structure that is hexagonal with each pair of opposed corners connected by a septum and parallel septa on either side connect the sides meeting at those opposed corners-. The overall effect is to provide a plurality of triangular passages through the element, each of essentially the same dimensions. Elements of this design are illustrated in Figures 1-2 of the Drawings.<br>
Also preferred is an element with a larger axially located passage as illustrated in Figure 5. This element is based on the design of Figure 1 and 2 with six of the triangular passages around the axis combined to form the larger axially located passage, 5. The Drawings show a packing element, 1, with a hexagonal containing structure, 2. A plurality of septa, 3, divide the interior space into a plurality of identical triangular passages, 4, through the element. The element has a length L, along the axis of symmetry, and a greatest dimension D, perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. In the Drawings the ratio of D:L is about 4. The axis of symmetry may be in the direction of extrusion of the structure.<br>
To demonstrate the significance of the D:L ratio, ceramic elements were prepared with the same D but with three different values of L. These elements were then placed in a tube through which a gas stream at 1500°F, (815.6°C), was passed at a rate of 207 ft/sec., (74.8 m/sec) , and the percentage of the thermal energy in the stream recovered through the contact with the media was measured and plotted against the aspect ratio. The results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
The percentage thermal energy . recovery was then determined as a function of the *gas velocity for each of the three elements. The results are shown in Figure 4. From these graphs it is very clear that there is a peak in percentage thermal energy recovery between about 2.7 and 4.5 aspect ratios and particularly between about 3.0 and 4.4 and that this advantage is maintained at all the gas flow rates tested.<br>
This result is completely unexpected since there is no prior art teaching that points in this directidfi. It is also clearly extremely advantageous that as much thermal energy as possible be recovered by each passage<br>
though the elements. «<br>
The advantage of the D: L ratio are also found in mass transfer applications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
