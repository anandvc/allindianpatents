The invention relates to cationically substituted diphenylazetidinones, to their physiologically acceptable salts and to derivatives having physiological functions.<br>
Diphenylazetidinones (such as, for example, ezetimibe) and their use for treating hyperlipldemia and arteriosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have already been described [cf. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(7):679-685) and US 5,756,470].<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide further compounds having a therapeutically utilizable hypolipidemic action. In particular, it was an object to find novel compounds which, compared to the compounds described in the prior art, are absorbed to a very low extent. Very low absorption is to be understood as meaning an intestinal absorption of less than 10%, preferably less than or equal to 5%.<br>
In particular, absorption of the novel compounds must be less than that of ezetimibe. Pharmaceutically active compounds which are absorbed to a low extent generally have considerably fewer side-effects.<br><br>
(CrCel-alkyl, NH2, NH(CrC6)-alkyl, N({C1-C6)-alkyl)2, SO2-CH3, COOH,<br>
C00-(C1-C6)-alkyl, CONH2;<br>

tricyclic trialkylammoniumalkyl radical, -(CH2)o-io-C(=NH}(NH2); -(CH2)o-io-C(=NH}(NHOH)or-NR7-C(=NR8)(NR9R10)and R7, R8, R9 and R10 independently of one another may be H, (C1-C6)-alkyl, (C1-Ce)-alkyl-phenyl, phenyl, {Cs-CaVcydoalkyl) and n may be 1 - 5,<br>
where in each case at least one of the radicals R1 to R6 must have the meaning (C3-C30)-alkylene-(LAG)n, where n = 1 ~ 5 and where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -S{0)n-, where n = 0 - 2, -0-, -(C=0)-, -(C=S)-, -CH=CH-, -CEC-, -N((C1-C6)-alkylh -N(phenyl)-, -N{(C1-C6}-alkyl-phenyl}-, -N(CO-(CH2)1-10-COOH)- or -NH-; and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Preference is given to compounds of the formula I where at least one of the radicals R1 to R6 has the meaning (Co-C3o)-aikylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -N((Gi-C6)-alkyl)-, -N(C0-(CH2)1-10--C00H)- or -NH-.<br>
Particular preference is given to compounds of the formula I where one of the radicals R1 or R3 has the meaning (Co-C3o)-alkylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -N(CH3}- or -NH-.<br>
Very particular preference is given to compounds of the formula I where one of the radicals R1 or R3 has the meaning -(CH2)o-1-Y-W-(Co-C25}-alkylene-Y'-W'-(LAG); where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by oxygen atoms and where Y and W independently of one another may be NH, NCH3, 0=0, O, a bond or S(0)r, where n = 0 - 2, and Y' and W independently of one another may be NH, NOH3, C=0, O, a bond or S(0)n, where n = 0 - 2, or Y-W or Y'-W In each case together may be a bond.<br><br><br>

Owing to their increased solubility in water, compared to the parent compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds according to the invention are salts of inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, glycolic acid, isothionic acid, lactic acid, lactobionlc acid, maleic acid, malic acid, methanesulfonic acid, succinic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, tartaric acid and trifluoroacetic acid, for example. For medical purposes, very particular preference is given to using the chloride salt. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
The scope of the invention also includes salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion, which salts may be useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br><br>
Here, the term "derivative having physiological function" refers to any physiologically acceptable derivative of a compound according to the invention, for example an ester, that is able, upon administration to a mammal, for example man, to form such a compound or an active metabolite (directly or indirectly).<br>
A further aspect of this invention are prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may or may not be active in their own right.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be present in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. The scope of the invention includes all polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention, which form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Hereinbelow, all references to "compound(s) of the formula (I)" refer to a compound or compounds of the formula (1) as described above, and to their salts, solvates and derivatives having physiological function, as described herein.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives having physiological function are ideal medicaments for treating an impaired lipid metabolism, in particular hyperlipidemia. The compounds of the formula I are also suitable for modulating the serum cholesterol concentration and for preventing and treating arteriosclerotic manifestations.<br>
The compound(s) of the formula (I) can also be administered in combination with other active compounds.<br>
The amount of a compound of the formula (I) required to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example on the specific compound chosen, on the intended use, on the mode of administration and on the clinical condition of the patient. In general, the daily dose is in the range from 0.1 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.1 mg to 50 mg) perday per kilogram of bodvweiaht. for<br><br>
example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. Tablets or capsules may contain, for example, from 0.01 to 100 mg, typically from 0.02 to 50 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the abovementioned weight data relate to the weight of the diphenyl-azetidinone-ion derived from the salt. For the prophylaxis or therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used themselves as the compound, but preferably they are present in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and is not harmful to the health of the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as an individual dose, for example as a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Further pharmaceutically active substances can also be present, including further compounds of the formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist in mixing the constituents with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or auxiliaries.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral or peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration, although the most suitable manner of administration is dependent in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the type of the compound of the formula (I) used in each case. Coated formulations and coated delayed-reiease formulations are also included in the scope of the invention. Acid-resistant and enteric formulations are preferred. Suitable enteric coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can be present in separate units, such as, for example, capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets, which in each case contain a specific amount of the compound of the formula (I); as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. As already mentioned, these<br><br>
compositions can be prepared according to any suitable pharmaceutical method which Includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which can consist of one or more additional constituents) are brought into contact. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product, if necessary, is shaped. For example, a tablet can thus be prepared by pressing or shaping a powder or granules of the compound, if appropriate with one or more additional constituents. Pressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, if appropriate mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or a (number of) surface-active/ dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be produced by shaping the pulverulent compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges which contain a compound of the formula (I) with a flavoring, customarily sucrose and gum arable or tragacanth, and pastilles which include the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arable.<br>

Example I 4-{1-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-4-oxoa2etidin-2-yl}-N-<br>
hydroxybenzamidine (3):<br><br>
a)       4-[5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenylamino)-5-hydroxy-2-{2-oxo-4-phenyl-oxazolidine-3-carbonyl)pentyl]benzonitrile(1):<br>
Under argon, 2.5 g of 3-[5-{4-fluorophenyl)-5-hydroxypentanoyl]-4-phenyloxa2olidin-2-one are dissolved in 30 ml of dichloromethane, 3.9 g of 4-[(4-fluorophenylimino)-methyl]benzonitrile are added and the mixture is cooled to -10°C. 6.4 ml of diisopropylethylamine and, over a period of 30 min, 4.05 ml of trimethylsilyl chloride are added to this mixture such that the temperature does not exceed -5°C. The mixture is stirred at this temperature for 1 additional hour and then cooled to -25'C. 0.8 ml of titanium tetrachloride is then added slowly. The dark mixture is stirred at from -25'C to -30°C over night and then decomposed using 35 ml of a 7% strength solution of tartaric acid, and the mixture is stirred for another hour at room temperature. 15 ml of a 20% strength sodium bicarbonate solution are then added.<br><br>
and the mixture is again stirred for 1 hour. After phase separation, the organic phase is washed with 30 ml of water, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to about 10 ml. 2 ml of bistrimethylsilylacetamide are added, and the mixture is then heated to reflux for 30 min and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is cristallized using ethyl acetate/heptane. The product is filtered off with suction and dried under reduced pressure. This gives the product of molecular weight 653.81 (C37H37F2N304Si); MS (ES1+): 654.3 (M+H*), 582.2 (M+H -Si(CH3)3).<br>
b)       {1-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-4-oxoazetldin-2-yljbenzonitrile (2):<br>
2 g of 4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-{4-fluorophenylamino)-5-hydroxy-2-(2-oxo-4-phenyloxazolidin-3-carbonyl)pentyl]benzonltrile (1) are dissolved in 20 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether and, together with 100 mg of tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate and 1.3 ml of bistrimethylsilylacetamide, heated at 40°C for about 1 h. The reaction is monitored by thin-layer chromatography.

Using the method described below, the activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention was examined:<br>
Effect on cholesterol absorption + H-taurocholic acid excretion using fecal excrement of mice, rats or hamsters<br>
NMRI mice, Wistar rats, or Golden Syrian hamsters (in groups of n=4-6) are kept in metabolic cages, where they are fed with a standard diet (Altromin, Lage (Lippe)). The afternoon prior to the administration of the radioactive tracers ('C-cholesterol), the feed is removed and the animals are adapted to grates.<br>
Additionally, the animals are labeled s.c. with H-TCA (taurocholic acid) (for example 1 pCi/mouse up to 5 pCi/rat) 24 hours prior to the peroral administration of the test meal ('C-choIesterol In Intralipid® 20, Pharmacia-Upjohn).<br>
Cholesterol absorption test: 0.25 ml/mouse Intralipid ©20 (Pharmacia-Upjohn) ((spiked with 0.25 pCi of "C-cholesterol in 0.1 mg of cholesterol) is administered perorally by gavage.<br>
Test substances are prepared separately in 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma)/5% Solutol (BASF, Ludwigshafen) or a suitable vehicle. The administration volume of the test substance is 0.5 ml/mouse. The test substance is administered immediately prior to the test meal (Intralipid labeled with<br><br>

C-cholesterol) (cholesterol absorption test).<br><br>
u.<br>
The feces are collected over a period of 24 h: fecal elimination of   C-cholesterol and H-taurocholic acid (TCA) is determined after 24 hours.<br><br>
The livers are removed and homogenized, and aliquots are incinerated in an oximate (Model 307, Packard) to determine the amount of ''C-cholesterol which had been taken up/absorbed.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
Feces samples:<br>
The total weight is determined, the sample is made up with water to a defined volume and then homogenized, and an aliquot is evaporated to dryness and incinerated In an oximate (Model 307 from Packard for the incineration of radioactlvely labeled samples): the amount of radioactive H-H20 and 'C-C02 is extrapolated to the amount of H-taurocholic acid and 'C-choiesterol, respectively, that is excreted (dual isotope technique). The ED200 values as dose from a dose-effect curve are interpolated as those doses at which the excretion of TCA or cholesterol is doubled, based on a control group treated at the same time.<br>
Liver samples:<br>
The amount of 'C-cholesterol taken up by the liver is based on the administered dose. The ED50 values are interpolated from a dose-effect curve as the dose at which the uptake of 'C-cholesterol by the liver is halved (50%), based on a control<br>
group.<br>
The ED50 values below demonstrate the activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from the table, the compounds of the formula I have very good cholesterol-lowering action.<br>
