[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/909,576 filed on April 2, 2007. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>

clutches and brakes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost<br>
and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit<br>
improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size<br>
and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved,<br>
cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00021] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[00022] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the<br>
elements of the four planetary gear sets. These permanent mechanical<br>
connections relate the transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first<br>
component or element of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
first component or element of a second planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
element of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third<br>
component or element of a third planetary gear set. A second component or<br>
element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or element of the third planetary gear set. Finally, a first component or<br>
element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first<br>
component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[00023] Referring now to FIG. 1, a first embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram<br>
is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as<br>
an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set.<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of said planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one<br>
for the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the<br>
ring gear member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be<br>
used to represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever<br>
ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to<br>
achieve appropriate ratios and an appropriate ratio progression. Mechanical<br>
couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear<br>
sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such<br>
as clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a<br>
brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the format,<br>
purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising,<br>
which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[00024] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft or<br>
member 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a<br>
second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third<br>
planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B<br>
and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or<br>
member 22. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the<br>
first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. The third node 14C of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18. The second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to<br>
the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 18A of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the first node 20A of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20.<br>
[00025] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the first node 14A of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to the<br>
third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first clutch 26 selectively<br>
connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to the second<br>
node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 28 selectively<br>
connects the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 to the third node<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 and the output shaft or member 22. A<br>
third clutch 32 selectively connects the second node 18B of the third planetary<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
gear set 18 to the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first brake<br>
36 selectively connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to<br>
ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40. A second brake 38<br>
selectively connects the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to<br>
ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40.<br>
[00026] Referring now to Figure 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the first embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In Figure 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of Figure 1<br>
is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly<br>
presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets 14, 16, 18 and 20 now<br>
appear as components of planetary gear sets such a sun gear members, ring<br>
gear members and planet gear carrier members having planet gears.<br>
[00027] For example, the transmission 10 includes the input shaft or<br>
member 12 which is coupled to and directly drives a first sun gear member 14A of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14. An extension of the input shaft or member 12 is<br>
connected to a second planet carrier member 16A of the second planetary gear<br>
set 16. The second planet carrier member 16A includes a plurality of planet gears<br>
16D rotatably disposed thereon. The planet gears 16D are each configured to<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 16B and the ring gear member 16C.<br>
The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to and directly driven by a fourth planet<br>
carrier member 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The fourth planet carrier<br>
member 20C includes a plurality of planet gears 20D rotatably disposed thereon.<br>
The planet gears 20D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 20A and the ring gear member 20B.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
[00028] A first clutch 26 selectively interconnects a first planet carrier<br>
member 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 with a second sun gear member<br>
16B of the second planetary gear set 16 and a third sun gear member 18B of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. The first planet carrier member 14B includes a<br>
plurality of pairs of planet gears 14D, 14E rotatably disposed thereon. The planet<br>
gears 14E are configured to each intermesh with both the sun gear member 14A<br>
and the planet gears 14D. The planet gears 14D are configured to each<br>
intermesh with both the planet gears 14E and the ring gear member 14C. A<br>
second clutch 28 selectively connects a second ring gear member 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 to the fourth planet carrier member 20C of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 and the output shaft or member 22. A third clutch 32<br>
selectively interconnects the second sun gear member 16B of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 and the third sun gear member 18B of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18 with a third ring gear member 18A of the third planetary gear set 18<br>
and a fourth sun gear member 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first<br>
brake 36 connects the first planet carrier member 14B of the first planetary gear<br>
set 14 to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40. A second brake<br>
38 connects a fourth ring gear member 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to<br>
ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40.<br>
[00029] A first shaft, quill or interconnecting member 42 couples a first<br>
ring gear member 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 to a third planet carrier<br>
member 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. The third planet carrier member<br>
18C includes a plurality of planet gears 18D rotatably disposed thereon. The<br>
planet gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
member 18B and the ring gear member 18A. A second shaft, quill or<br>
interconnecting member 44 couples the first planet carrier member 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14 to the first clutch 26. A third shaft, quill or interconnecting<br>
member 46 couples the first clutch 26 to the second sun gear member 16B of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16, the third sun gear member 18B of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18 and the third clutch 32. A fourth shaft, quill or<br>
interconnecting member 48 couples the second ring gear member 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 to the second clutch 28. A fifth shaft, quill or<br>
interconnecting member 56 couples the third ring gear member 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18, the third clutch 32 and the fourth sun gear member 20A of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[00030] Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, the operation of the first<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It will<br>
be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of a<br>
combination of three of the clutches and brakes as will be explained below.<br>
Figure 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and<br>
brakes that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001129-PTT-DLT<br>
[00031] To establish forward and reverse speed ratios, three torque<br>
transmitting devices are engaged for each gear state. The engaged clutches and<br>
brakes are represented by an "X" in each respective row. For example, to<br>
establish reverse gear, the first brake 36, the second brake 38 and the second<br>
clutch 28 are engaged or activated. The first brake 36 grounds the first planet<br>
carrier member 14B of the first planetary gear set 14. The second brake 38<br>
grounds the fourth ring gear member 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The<br>
second clutch 28 interconnects the second ring gear member 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 through the fourth shaft, quill or interconnecting member 48<br>
with the fourth planet carrier member 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 and<br>
the output shaft or member 22.<br>
[00032] Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch and brake engagement as shown in Figure 3.<br>
[00033] It will be appreciated that the operation and gear states of the<br>
first embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 assume, first of all,<br>
that the brakes and clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts, i.e.,<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>

[00039] Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, the operation of the second<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 100 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 112 to the output shaft or member 122 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of a<br>
combination of three of the clutches and brakes as will be explained below.<br>
Figure 6 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and<br>
brakes that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[00040] To establish forward and reverse speed ratios, three torque<br>
transmitting devices are engaged for each gear state. The engaged clutches and<br>
brakes are represented by an "X" in each respective row. For example, to<br>
establish reverse gear, the first brake 136, the second brake 138 and the third<br>

forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement as shown in Figure 6.<br>
[00041] It will be appreciated that the operation and gear states of the<br>
eight speed automatic transmission 100 assume, first of all, that the brakes and<br>
clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
