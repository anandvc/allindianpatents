FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to groove reinforced decorative and/or structural satures for carbonated beverage containers (e.g. bottles) and hot fill containers nade of a plastic and to methods and apparatus for producing such containers.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
"Plastic" is a polymerizable material that can be bi-axially oriented, e.g. &gt;olyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile (AN) suitable for use in containers for liquid under pressure e.g., carbonated beverages &gt;r for use in hot fill containers.<br>
"PET" as used herein shall be construed as including all materials defined lereinbefore as "Plastic",<br>
"Bubble" as used herein is a circular, decorative feature formed by a ieformation of the wall, which includes a shoulder, of a plastic container which ioes not extend outwardly (relative to the axis of the container) from the exterior surface of the container even when the container contains a liquid under pressure a.g. a carbonated beverage and is exposed to industry defined test procedures for &gt;uch containers including exposure to stresses resulting from pressure and slevated temperatures during filling, packaging, distribution, sale and the end user actions.<br>
"Circular" as used herein with respect to bubbles shall be construed to nclude ovals, ellipses, teardrops and other rounded shapes as well as circular &gt;hapes.<br>
"Structural feature" as used herein shall be construed to include any feature ntegrally formed in the wall of a plastic container which alone, or together with another such feature, forms, e.g. symbols, icons, words, names, ribs, bands, panels, decorative patterns or any combination of these.<br>
"Container" as used herein shall be construed to include, e.g. plastic bottles and hot fill containers.<br><br>
"Frustum" as used herein shall be construed as a truncated hollow right circular cone in which the apex is replaced by a plane section parallel to the cone base and which has parallel inner and outer surfaces and shall be construed to include a hollow cylinder which has parallel inner and outer surfaces.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
PET for carbonated beverage containers has been used for many years. Many different shapes have been and are used to establish distinction between various brands of products. Some of these are decorative features formed in the surface of the container including ribs and swirls. Such decorative features may project inwardly and/or outwardly from the exterior surface of the container, in addition many prior art containers have been provided with structural features, for example, recessed or raised panels in attempts to reduce or eliminate distortion resulting from internal pressure, hot filling, etc. Some of these features also are intended to be decorative in nature.<br>
Generally C02 is used for carbonated soft drinks but other gases such as N2<br>
are also used to pressurize a plastic container. When the filled containers are<br>
exposed to typical service conditions especially higher than room temperature<br>
conditions, the pressure within the container increases while the plastic softens.<br>
This leads to creep (the plastic flows and distorts the container shape). One of the<br>
disadvantages of prior art decorative designs is that the PET will creep when<br>
exposed to excessive pressures and temperatures and many of the features will<br>
become distorted or even obliterated due to this creep. The desired distinctive<br>
features, particularly recessed features are then lost.<br>
!	In the case of hot fill containers the filling material is typically introduced into<br>
the container at a temperature of about 185°F plus/minus about 20°F and the container is then sealed before the filling material cools. This results in a partial vacuum being formed in the container during the cooling which leads to a potential for the collapse of the container unless strengthening features are provided which in the prior art have often been provided by the addition of material to the container which results in a heavier container and an increase of the cost of the material of the container.<br><br>
One attempt at producing a circular decorative feature is illustrated by the dimple 1, shown in Fig. 1 in an unpressurized state. In Fig. 1 a container 2 defines a longitudinal axis 3 and a wall radius 4. This dimple tends to invert and/or distort upon pressurization to a form such as that shown dashed in Fig. 1. This invention can be avoided by providing a thickened wall in the region of the dimple. This is, however, an undesirable solution due to the significant increase in material costs resulting from the additional material used, particularly when there is a substantial plurality of such dimples forming a distinctive pattern on the bottle. Inversions of the dimple is particularly undesirable because of resulting handling problems, labeling problems and questions of aesthetic appearance.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention are to provide stable features in a wall of a container which may or may not extend outwardly of the wall and which may have decorative and/or reinforcing characteristics, for example, to form a decoration, manufactures logo or name, to provide resistance to container collapse under hot fill conditions and/or to provide resistance to distortion of the container under the service conditions to which carbonated beverage containers may be subjected.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring first to Figs. 2 and 3, a bubble 6 of the first embodiment, formed in the wall 7 of container, having an interior surface 8 and an exterior surface 9, blow molded from a conventional preform of PET, is an integral structure composed of a circular central dome 10 smoothly connected to an inner frustum 16 increasing in diameter to an annular trough 18 which in turn is smoothly connected to an outer frustum 20 increasing in diameter to an annular outer ring 22 smoothly interconnecting the outer frustum 20 to the wall 7 of the container.<br>
The central dome 10 has a convex outer surface 11 extending toward the adjacent exterior surface 9 of the container wall 7 and a concave inner surface 12 parallel to the convex outer surface 11 and facing the interior 14 of the container.<br>
The following dimensions are without a pressurized interior of the container and without the container being exposed to an elevated temperature substantially above ambient room temperature. In addition, the following dimensions relate to a bubble formed in a container having a radius in a range of about 1.1 inches to about 1.6 inches, preferably about 1.3 inches. A typical central dome 10 has a radius 24 of the concave surface in a range of from about 0.19 of an inch to about 0.32 of an inch, preferably about 0.23 of an inch, a diameter of about 0.25 of an inch, a radial spacing 26 from the outer extremity of the convex outer surface 11 to the exterior surface 9 of the wail 7 of the container in a range of about 0.01 of an inch to about 0.03 of an inch, preferably about 0.013 of an inch and a thickness 28 approximately equal to the walUr thickness 29 of the container, for example, of about 0.013 of an inch. Wall thicknesses 29 are preferably in a range from about 0.010 of an inch to about 0.015 of an inch, but should not be construed as being limited to this range.<br><br>
A typical inner frustum 16 has a straight longitudinal dimension (length) 30 in cross-section in a range of about 0.003 of an inch to about 0.05 of an inch and preferably has a length of at least 0.005 of an inch and a thickness approximately equal to the thickness 29 of the wall 7. Although the presence of the inner frustum 16 and the outer frustum 20 is preferred and enhances the stability of the bubble 6, one of the frustums 16 and 20 may be omitted.<br>
A typical annular trough 18 has a diameter 32 of about 0.3 of an inch and an internal radius 34 in cross-section in a range of from about 0.005 of an inch to about 0.05 of an inch with a preferred radius of about 0.015 of an inch. The thickness 36 of the trough 18 wall in cross-section is approximately equal to the thickness 29 of the wall 7. The radial spacing 42 of the inner surface (the surface facing the exterior surface 9 of the container) of the trough from the exterior surface 9 of wall 7 is in a range of from about 0.07 of an inch to about 0.15 of an inch, preferably about 0.1 of an inch.<br>
A typical outer frustum 20 has the same dimensions and ranges of<br>
dimensions specified above for the inner frustum 16. The irjjpluded angle 38jrf the<br>
cross-sectbgaof the frustums 16 and 20 is in the range of about 65° to about 80°, r '<br>
preferab^ abouj) 73° r	^■-^<br>
A typical outer-ring 22 has a radius 40 in cross-section in a range of from about 0.09 of an inch to about 0.13 of an inch, preferably about 0.11 of an inch, and a wall thickness in cross-section approximately equal to the wall thickness 29 of wall 7.<br>
The diameter 42 of the bubble 6 is preferably in a range of from about 0.100<br>
of an inch to about 0.500 of an inch, Th© above dimensions are chosen to allow<br>
formation of a bubble 6 having k^meter at or close to the maximum diameter<br>
of 0.500 of an inch.	fye* • \   y<br>
It will be appreciated that the choice of actual dimensions for the features of the bubble 6 will be chosen to produce smooth transitions to between the various elements 10,16, 18, 20 and 22 making up the bubble 6 and to the wall 7.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 4 a fragmentary portion of a blow mold 44 illustrates the blow mold features which form the bubble 6 during a blow molding of a convention<br><br>
PET preform into a container. The fragmentary portion of the blow mold is a cross-section taken normal to the longitudinal axis 46 of the blow mold and the container. The blow mold features include an annular projection 48 terminating at its outer extremity 50 in a radius in cross-section to form the internal radius of the trough 18 and providing side surfaces 52 to form the inner and outer frustums 16, 20 of the bubble 6. The annular projection decreases in diameter toward the outer extremity 50 with an included angle 53 of approximately 10°.<br>
The provision of this inwardly decreasing diameter of the pre }tion 48 facilitates the formation of the trough 18 and frustums-! 6,20 and eases removal of the container with formed bubble(s) from the blow mold.<br>
It is to be noted that the blow molding is achieved by applying a pressure to the interior of a conventionally pre-heated preform sufficient (about 400 p.s.i. or greater) to inflate and deform the preform into engagement with the blow mold and its bubble forming features. However, it should also be noted that while the cylindrical wall 7 of the container intimately contacts the wall forming portion of the blow mold the bubble 6, being formed, contacts only the outer extremity 50 and the side surfaces 52 adjacent this outer extremity.<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b show two elevations, taken at 90° to one another, of a PET footed container 54, according to the invention, with a decorative pattern of bubbles 6 formed in a wall 7 and a shoulder 56 thereof.<br>
As previously mentioned the bubbles do not extend outwardly of the container and are preferable recessed relative to the exterior surface of the wall 7 (and shoulder 56) even when the container filled with a carbonated beverage or other pressurized liquid is subjected to elevated temperatures and mechanical stresses in accordance with industry standards.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-section of a blow mold 58 having a blow mold cavity 60 defining bubble forming features 62, as illustrated in Fig. 4, for producing the container 54 of Fig. 5a and 5b with a decorative pattern of a plurality of bubbles 6.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a second embodiment of a bubble 64 according to the present invention in which the trough 18 is replaced by a trough 66 having a very small radius or a non-existent internal surface joining the frustums16 and 20.<br><br>
The portion 44 of the blow mold shown in Fig. 7 has an annular projection 62 having an outer extremity which is complimentary to the form of the trough 66.<br>
In order to avoid distortion (e.g. bridging of gullies) of the container between bubbles, it is preferred that bubble spacing exceed 0.100 of an inch from bubble perimeter to bubble perimeter.<br>
A method of the present invention to produce structural features, such as a bubble, in the wall of a container for pressurized liquids (e.g. a carbonated beverage) or hot fill containers which, even under elevated temperatures and mechanical stresses acceptable to the industry (i.e. the carbonated beverage industry), does not unacceptably distort the container, comprises:<br>
a)	providing a blow mold having structural feature forming features in the form of annular projections) extending toward the axis 46 of the mold cavity and container to be formed, the annular projection(s) having an outer extremity and adjacent side surface(s) complimentary to the trough 18 or 66 and frustums 16.20 respectively.<br>
b)	pre-heating a preform to facilitate blow molding to form the container and bubble(s);<br>
c)	introducing the preform into the blow mold;<br>
d)	applying a gas at a pressure sufficient (about 400 p.s.i. or greater) to inflate and deform the preform into contact with the mold cavity to form the container and into contact with the complimentary features to produce the bubble(s) in the wall (and/or shoulder) thereof, the bubble(s) being formed failing to contact the mold cavity in the region of the/their central dome(s) 10 and a substantial portion of the outer ring(s) 22;<br><br>
e)	cooling the container; and<br>
f)	removing the container with bubble(s) formed therein from the blow mold cavity.<br>
Fig. 9 is graphical representation of PET bubble deflection, against internal<br>
pressure in the container, for three bubble diameters (large, medium and small), for<br>
example, 0.500 of an inch, 0.300 of an inch and 0.150 of an inch, each with three wall<br>
thickness, namely, 0.010 of an inch, 0.0125 of an inch and	<br><br>
.015 of an inch with an arbitrary failure mode being defined as 0.10 of an inch of leflection. The failure mode is defined as a deflection outwardly of the container ufficient for the bubble to project outwardly beyond the radius of the container wall ' or for a portion of the trough invert or kink.<br>
While the trough 18, 66 is central to the design of a bubble described in letail with reference to Figs. 2 and 3, such a trough may be used in defining and acilitating the formation of other integral features in containers blow molded from &gt;reforms, which may be conventional preforms of PET, including containers for )ressurized liquids and hot fill containers.<br>
Figs. 10-16 illustrated various features as examples of those made possible Dy the use of trough(s) 18, 66 as described in detail with reference to Figs. 2-9. Such features may include, for example, symbols, icons, words, names, ribs, bands, panels, decorative patterns and any combination of these.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate an icon formed, in similar manner to the bubble 6 (or 64) of Figs. 2 and 3, of two shaped domed areas 10 each defined by perimeter troughs 18 (or 66) surrounding each domed area, the domed areas being disposed adjacent one another to define the desired icon. In this case the central portion of the icon extends outwardly from the outer radius 23 of the container wall about container axis 46 and includes an elongate curved area 68 between the bubbles and troughs which is outwardly curved in cross-section (Fig. 11).<br>
Fig. 12 shows a variation of Fig. 10 in which the troughs 18 (or 66) are interconnected to close and strengthen the ends of the outwardly curved area 68. In Fig. 13 a plurality of parallel troughs 18 (or 66) disposed equally spaced apart circumferentially about the axis 46 of a container to form strengthening bands or ribs 70 to reinforce a container wall 72 against internal pressure exerted by pressurized liquid or against a partial vacuum formed in the container as a result of a hot fill process. The bands or ribs 70 may be strategically placed in various parts of the wall of the container to selectively strengthen those parts as desired or needed. The bands or ribs may also be designed to enhance the appearance of the container and may be interrupted as desired by the formation of symbols, icons,<br><br>
ames or other patterns, e.g. the icon of Figs. 10-12 and bubbles 6 (or 64) as<br>
reviously described.<br>
Fig. 14 provides reinforcement similar to that of Fig. 13 but with the troughs<br>
8 (or 66) forming bands or ribs 70 extending longitudinally parallel to the axis 46<br>
if the container. Similar uses and variations are applicable here as are described<br>
vith reference to Fig. 13.<br>
Figs. 15 and 16 illustrate the formation of a recessed panel 74 in the wall 72 )f a container, the panel 74 being surrounded by a reinforcing trough 18 (or 66). k plurality of panels may be provided and these panels, although not shown, may project outwardly from the wall 72 and may be interrupted by, and may themselves define, features as disclosed with reference to Fig. 13. In addition, where appropriate the trough 18 (or 66) may be interrupted for structural, aesthetic or manufacturing reasons provided that the structural performance of the container is not compromised.<br>
As desired, the troughs 18 (or 66) may be stressed during blow molding to provide some crystallization of material in the troughs thereby to produce a white haze in the trough for decorative reasons and/or to more clearly define or outline features formed using the troughs. The density of the white haze may be varied by appropriately changing the radius 34 of the trough, the smaller the radius the greater the whitening of the material.<br>
By the use of features, of the present invention, appropriately arranged in the wall of a hot fill container, the containers collapse pressure under the partial vacuum produced during a typical hot fill process may be increased by about 20% compared to a container of similar wall thickness and configeration.<br>
Although described with reference to pressurized liquids e.g., carbonated beverages and hot fill materials, it will be appreciated that the container described would exhibit the same appearance characteristics when unpressurized.<br><br>
