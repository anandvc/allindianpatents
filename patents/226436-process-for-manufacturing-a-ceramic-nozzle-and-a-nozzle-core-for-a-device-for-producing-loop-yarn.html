				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Technical part<br>
The invention pertains to a process for manufacturing a ceramic nozzle core as part of a<br>
device for producing loop yarn, as well as a nozzle core for a device for producing loop<br>
yarn.<br>
State-of-the-art technology<br>
By the term texturing, one partly understands finishing of spun filament bundles or the<br>
corresponding continuous filament yarns, with the objective of giving the yarn a textile<br>
character. In the following description, the term texturing means producing a large<br>
number of loops on individual filaments, or production of loop yarn. An older solution<br>
for texturing is described in EP 0 088 254. The continuous filament yarn is fed to the<br>
yarn-guiding channel at the inlet end of a texturing nozzle and textured at a trumpet-<br>
shaped exit end by the impact forces of a supersonic flow. The yarn-guiding channel is<br>
cylindrical, with constant cross-section. The inlet is slightly rounded for a smooth<br>
introduction for untreated yarn. There is a guiding body at the trumpet-shaped exit end,<br>
whereby the loop formation takes place between the trumpet shape and the guiding body.<br>
The yarn is fed to the texturing nozzle with great over-supply. The over-supply is<br>
required for loop formation at each individual filament, which leads to titre increase at<br>
the exit end.<br>
The patent document EP 0 088 254 is based on a device for texturing at least one<br>
continuous filament yarn consisting of several filaments. The nozzle contains a yarn-<br>
guiding channel and at least one feed entering into the channel in radial direction for a<br>
pressure medium. The generic nozzle had an exit opening of the channel that gets<br>
extended outwards and a spherical or hemispherical guiding body that protrudes into the<br>
exit opening and forms a ring slot with the same. It was recognised, that while texturing<br>
yarns, retaining the yarn properties during the processing sequences as well as thereafter<br>
in the finished produce, is an important criterion for the usability of such yarns.<br>
Furthermore, intimate mixing or more yarns and the individual filaments of the textured<br><br>
yarn is of great importance for achieving a uniform product image. The stability is<br>
thereby considered as quality concept.<br>
For determining the instability I of the yarn, yarn hanks with four windings, each of one<br>
meter circumference, are formed on a reel, as explained on the basis of a multi-filament<br>
yarn on polyester with the litre 167f68 dtex. These hanks are then stressed for one<br>
minute with 25 cN, and thereafter the length X is determined. This is similarly followed<br>
up with a one-minute stressing with 1250 cN. After de-stressing, the hank is again<br>
stressed with 25 cN after one minute and after another minute the length Y is determined.<br>
From this one obtains this value of the instability:<br><br>
The instability indicates, what percentage of remaining expansion has been caused by the<br>
applied stress. The patent document EP 0 088 254 had the task of creating an improved<br>
device of the described type, with which an optimum texturing effect can be achieved and<br>
which ensures a high stability of the yarn as well as a high intimate mixing degree of<br>
individual filaments. As solution it was suggested that the outer diameter of the convex<br>
exit opening of the channel be at least 4-times the diameter of the channel and at least<br>
0.5-times the diameter of the spherical or hemispherical guiding body (5). As optimum<br>
results one obtains production speeds in a range of100 to over 600 m/min. An<br>
interesting fact is that the applicant was successful in marketing corresponding nozzles<br>
for a period of over 15 years. The quality of the thus produced yarn was assessed as very<br>
good over a period of 1Â½ decades. However, there was an increasing demand for<br>
enhancing the capacity. With the solution as described in EP 0 880 611, the applicant<br>
was successful in achieving a massive capacity enhancement up to way above 1000<br>
m/min. of yarn transporting velocity. The core idea for capacity enhancement lay in<br>
intensifying the flow behaviours in the expanding supersonic channel, i.e. in the zone in<br>
which the loop formation takes place. The yarn tension at the exit of the texturing nozzle<br>
was taken as particular testing criterion. A series of investigations brought to light, that<br>
in the solution as described in EP 0 088 254, the yarn tension drops significantly after<br><br>
approx. 600 m/min. yarn transportation velocity. This is ultimately the explanation for<br>
capacity limitation for these nozzle types. The suggestion of the patent document EP 0<br>
880 611 for intensifying the flow in the supersonic channel resulted in an unexpected<br>
increase in yarn tension, which allowed increasing the transportation velocity to over<br>
1000 m/min. The quality of the thus processed yarn was initially assessed as same even<br>
at the highest transportation velocity, or perhaps even better. Subsequent practice<br>
revealed surprises to the extent, that in many applications the yarn quality did not<br>
conform to the desired specifications.<br>
ft was recognised in the document EP 0 880 611 that the first key for quality lies in the<br>
yarn tension after the texturing nozzle. Only when one succeeds in increasing the yarn<br>
tension, the quality can be improved. The breakthrough came, when the flow of the blast<br>
air jet over the region Mach 2 was increased. A series of experiments confirm that, not<br>
only the quality gets improved but that the quality is surprisingly negatively influenced to<br>
a very low extent due to increase in production speed. Even a slight increase of the Mach<br>
number above 2 already yielded significant results. The best explanation for the<br>
corresponding intensification of the texturing process lies therein, that the speed<br>
difference immediately before and after the impact front is increased, which has a direct<br>
effect on the corresponding attacking forces of the air on the filaments. The increased<br>
forces in the region of the impact front cause an increase in yarn tension. By increasing<br>
the Mach number, immediately the action at the impact front is increased. According to<br>
1	he invention, the legitimacy of the following equation has been recognised: higher Mach<br>
number = stronger impact = more intensive texturing. The intensified supersonic flow<br>
acts on a border front and more intensively on the individual filaments of the open yarn,<br>
so that no loops can get diverted sideways over the effective zone of the impact front. As<br>
generation of the supersonic flow in the acceleration channel is based on expansion, with<br>
the help of a higher Mach region, i.e. Mach 2.5 instead of Mach 1.5, one also obtains an<br>
increase or almost doubling of the effective outlet cross-section. Various surprising<br>
observations could be made and confirmed in combination with the new invention:<br>
comparative studies between the state-of-the-art technology texturing as per EP 0 088<br>
2	54 and the solution within the framework of EP 0 880 611 yielded in a significantly<br><br>
wide range, the following relationships: the texturing quality in case of a higher<br>
production velocity, in comparison to the texturing quality in case of lower production<br>
velocity, with a supersonic channel designed for the lower Mach region, is at least the<br>
same or even better. The texturing sequence is so intensive for air velocities in the<br>
impact front of over Mach 2, i.e. for Mach 2.5 to Mach 5, that even at the highest yarn<br>
run-through velocities, all loops almost without any exception can be caught and bound<br>
well in the yarn. The generation of an air velocity in the high Mach region within the<br>
acceleration channel has the effect, that the texturing no longer collapses up to the highest<br>
velocities. Secondly, the entire filament composite is guided within clear outer channel<br>
limits uniformly and directly into the impact front zone.<br>
In the acceleration channel, the yarn gets drawn in by the accelerating air jet over the<br>
corresponding path stretch, further opened and handed over to the immediately connected<br>
texturing zone. The blast air jet is subsequently guided to the acceleration channel<br>
without any deflection through a non-continuous and strongly expanding section. One or<br>
more yarn threads with same or different over-supply can be introduced and textured at a<br>
production speed of 400 to over 1200 m/min. The compressed air jet in the supersonic<br>
channel is accelerated to 2.0 to 6 Mach, preferably to 2.5 to 4 Mach. The best results are<br>
achieved, if the exit-side end of the yarn channel is limited by a rebounding body. The<br>
textured yarn is removed through a slot almost perpendicular to the yarn channel axis.<br>
The total theoretically effective expanding angle of the supersonic channel should lie<br>
from the smallest to the largest diameter above 10Â°, however below 40Â°, preferably<br>
within 15Â° to 30Â°. According to the prevalent roughness values, with reference to series<br>
production, one has obtained a maximum limiting angle (total angle) of 35Â° to 36Â°. In a<br>
conical/tapered acceleration channel, the compressed air is accelerated almost<br>
continuously. The nozzle channel section immediately before the supersonic channel is<br>
designed somewhat cylindrical, whereby blowing-in into the cylindrical section is carried<br>
out with conveying components in the direction towards the acceleration channel. The<br>
draving-in force on the yarn gets increased with the length of acceleration channels. The<br>
nozzle expansion or the increase in Mach number gives the intensity of texturing. The<br><br>
acceleration channel should have at least a cross-section expansion range of 1:2.0,<br>
preferably 1:2.5 or greater. It is further suggested that the length of the acceleration<br>
channel be 3 to 15 times greater, preferably 4 to 12 times greater, than the diameter of the<br>
yarn channel at the beginning of the acceleration channel. The acceleration channel can<br>
be entirely or partly designed as continuously expanding, can have conical/tapered<br>
sections and/or a slightly spherical shape. The acceleration channel can also be designed<br>
fine-stepped and have different acceleration zones, with at least one zone with great<br>
acceleration and at least one zone with small acceleration of the compressed air jet. If the<br>
mentioned limiting conditions for the acceleration channel are maintained, then the<br>
mentioned variations of the acceleration channel have proved to be almost of equal value<br>
or at least as equivalent. After the supersonic channel, the yarn channel has a highly<br>
convex yarn channel opening that is trumpet-shaped and expanded by more than 40Â°,<br>
whereby the transition from the supersonic channel into the yarn channel opening should<br>
preferably take place non-continuously. A further decisive factor was found therein, that<br>
with a rebounding body, above all, even the pressure conditions of the texturing chamber<br>
could be positively influenced and kept stable. A further preferred design of the texturing<br>
nozzle has the feature that it has a continuous yarn channel with a central cylindrical<br>
section, into which the air feed enters.<br>
In all earlier investigations it could only be confirmed that the data calculated for<br>
texturing nozzles with radial air-blowing into the yarn channel as per EP 0 088 254, the<br>
optimum blowing-in angle for the treatment air lies at 48Â°. As a complete surprise, one<br>
found out in the most recent experiments, that increasing the blowing-in angle with<br>
nozzles as per EP 0 880 611 already in the first series of experiments brought about an<br>
unexpected increase in quality of the textured yarns. It has been recognised by the<br>
inventors that both the process zones, i.e.<br>
-	Opening of the yarn and<br>
-	Texturing of the yarn<br>
are core features and have to be optimally tuned to one another. Repeated experiments<br>
have shown that in the solution as per EP 0 088 254 the limitation lies in the texturing<br>
zone and therefore an increase of the yarn opening would bring only disadvantages.<br><br>
It is known from the field of yarn intermingling, which is not an object of this<br>
application, that the yarn opening effect is maximum at a blowing-in angle of 90Â°. The<br>
purpose of intermingling is to form regular knots of the yarn. As example for<br>
intermingling, please refer to DE 195 80 019. On the other hand, textured yarn should<br>
not have any knots under any circumstances. There is a limiting zone for the blowing-in<br>
angle for both these basically different processes of knot formation and loop formation.<br>
From the point of view of different functions for achieving the highest yarn qualities,<br>
even at maximum yarn transportation speeds, there was an unexpected increase as<br>
explained further below. At least from the point of view of the applicant, it was<br>
considered to be of great disadvantage, that for manufacturing the so-called nozzle cores<br>
complicated production processes were necessary. All experiments with economic<br>
methods, like pressing or injection moulding, failed. It was not possible to manufacture<br>
usable blanks within the framework of the prescribed data, either by pressing method or<br>
by injection moulding method. The reason for this was the speciality of the material<br>
ceramic. Ceramic continues to be one of the best materials from the point of view to<br>
wear and tear or durability.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to, on the one hand, ensure all the recognised<br>
advantages of the described nozzle cores and, on the other hand, develop new production<br>
methods that allow cost-effective production of nozzle cores.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The process according to the invention has the feature, that the ceramic nozzle core is<br>
designed with approximately constant wall thickness and is reduced in size to the central<br>
functions of the yarn treatment channel, with air blow-in and yarn outlet for loop<br>
formation, and is produced in the moulding method.<br>
A particularly advantageous extension has the feature, that the ceramic nozzle core is<br>
injected in high-precision method.<br><br>
The nozzle core according to the invention has the feature, that it is designed as ceramic<br>
nozzle core with almost constant wall thickness and is reduced in size to the central<br>
functions of the yarn treatment channel, with air blow-in and yarn outlet for loop<br>
formation, and is produced in the moulding method.<br>
The applicant so far assumed that for each new development an important criterion was<br>
to design the nozzle core as interchangeable core, in such a way that a nozzle core can be<br>
used in other inner dimensions and air inlet angles. It is thus possible to replace an<br>
existing nozzle core according to the state-of-the-art technology with slight manipulations<br>
and utilise all advantages of the new development. It has been recognised by the<br>
invention only now, mat this actually positive requirement was taken literally for the<br>
earlier developments and strongly prevented any further development. The result was<br>
that each new nozzle core was designed in its outer measurements identical to the old<br>
nozzle core. The consequence was that blanks for the nozzle core could increasingly not<br>
be produced in casting or pressing process, or unfavourable pre-requisites were created<br>
for production in moulding method. This new invention has liberated itself from the<br>
literal compulsion of designing the ceramic nozzle core as interchangeable core. The<br>
extension is consequently aligned more to the inner central functions. The entire<br>
structure/shape can now be laid down according to casting-technical requirements and<br>
can be designed as miniaturised ceramic nozzle core with external nozzle ceramic jacket<br>
by dividing into two. Only the outer jacket is given the dimensions of the nozzle cores<br>
according to the state-of-the-art technology, which also takes over the function of the<br>
interchangeable core.<br>
The new invention allows a large number of particularly advantageous extensions, for<br>
which kindly refer to the claims 4 to 10. A particularly advantageous extension has the<br>
feature, that the yarn treatment channel has at least one cylindrical section and one<br>
expansion section, whereby the blowing-in mechanism is arranged within the cylindrical<br>
section, preferably somewhat in the central region of the longitudinal side of the ceramic<br>
nozzle core. The expansion section can be designed completely trumpet-shaped<br><br>
according to EP 0 088 254, or have a conical/tapered as well as a trumpet-shaped section<br>
according to EP 0 880 611. The yarn channel has a central, preferably cylindrical<br>
section, which is led across into the conical/tapered expansion in transport direction<br>
without any jump, whereby the compressed air is blown into the cylindrical section at a<br>
sufficient distance from the conical/tapered expanded supersonic channel. Experiments<br>
in connection with the new invention brought about various new findings:<br>
With texturing nozzles with intensive supersonic flow according to EP 0 880 611, a<br>
quality improvement could be achieved for each yarn titre, when the blowing-in angle<br>
was increased above 48Â°. The quality enhancement begins with a marked rise by<br>
increasing the angle above 50Â°. For blowing-in angles greater than 52Â°, partly up to 60Â°<br>
and even 65Â°, surprisingly the yarn quality remains constant. The optimum blowing-in<br>
angle is however also dependent on the yarn titre.<br>
The compressed air is blown into the yarn channel through three holes staggered by 120Â°<br>
in the circumference. In any case it is important that the yarn opening intensifies due to<br>
blowing-in of the compressed air into the yarn channel, but however a knot formation in<br>
the yarn is avoided. The opening of the yarn, on the one hand, as well as texturing of the<br>
yarn on the other hand, must be optimised in themselves. For optimising both the totally<br>
different functions, these have to be carried out at separate locations, but however shortly<br>
after one another, in such a way that the opening follows immediately after texturing, or<br>
that completion of the yarn opening sequence immediately passes over to the texturing.<br>
All central texturing functions for production of a loop yarn can now be realised within a<br>
miniaturised ceramic nozzle core. The new ceramic nozzle core can be part of a device,<br>
which has a ball-shaped rebounding body that can be countersunk into the expansion<br>
section, whereby the trumpet-shaped section has a radius that is in relation to the<br>
diameter of the rebounding body. According to EP 0 088 254, the rebounding body with<br>
the trumpet-shaped section forms a ring slot, whereby the outer diameter of the convex-<br>
shaped outlet opening of the channel is at least 4-times the diameter of the channel and at<br>
least 0 5-times the diameter of the spherical or hemispherical guiding body.<br><br>
Absolutely ideally, the nozzle core is designed as a two-part component and has an outer<br>
nozzle body, into which the ceramic nozzle core can be inserted, whereby the outer<br>
nozzle body is made of plastic. The outer plastic body has the function of an<br>
interchangeable body, as understood so far, with the necessary mounting dimensions and<br>
fastening agents. The plastic body also additionally has a protective function for the<br>
ceramic nozzle core. Between the outer nozzle body and the ceramic nozzle core a<br>
clamping point is arranged for fastening the ceramic nozzle core in the outer nozzle body.<br>
Between the ceramic nozzle core and the nozzle body, in the region of the cylindrical<br>
section, additionally a ring-shaped compression air channel is attached, through which<br>
the air blowing takes place with the help of the blowing-in holes. At both end regions of<br>
the cylindrical section the compressed air channel respectively has a sealing point for<br>
sealing the compressed air.<br>
According to a further extension, the nozzle core is designed as quickly replaceable<br>
element within the device, so that it can be quickly mounted and dismantled from the<br>
device along with the ceramic nozzle core. The nozzle core can be designed as a two-<br>
part component, with an inner ceramic nozzle core and an outer nozzle body, whereby<br>
both parts are one device with rotary drive and the nozzle body can be driven/activated<br>
with the built-in ceramic nozzle core.<br>
In the two-part solution, the ceramic nozzle core and the outer nozzle body in combined<br>
condition form an almost plane surface. According to an important requirement for the<br>
new solution, the shape/design of the nozzle body should be able to accommodate<br>
variations in shape and thickness. The structural requirements with respect to the<br>
combination, as well as installation in a machine, could be handled in this way through<br>
the outer nozzle body. The ceramic nozzle core can be optimally shaped with respect to<br>
production of ceramic blanks. Absolutely ideally, the nozzle body is produced as<br>
synthetic injection part and designed in its outer measurements as interchangeable part<br>
with reference to corresponding solutions as per the state-of-the-art technology.<br><br>
The new invention is based on the genre of texturing nozzles according to the radial<br>
principle. In the radial principle, the blast air is guided from the feeding point into a<br>
cylindrical section of the yarn channel directly in an axial direction with almost constant<br>
velocity right up to the acceleration channel. As in the state-of-the-art technology as per<br>
EP 0 880 611, even with the new solution, one or more yarn threads can be textured with<br>
different over-supply.<br>

Ways and execution of the invention<br>
Now we refer to fig. 1. The texturing nozzle 1 has a yarn channel 4 with a cylindrical<br>
section 2. which at the same time also corresponds to the narrowest cross-section 3 with a<br>
diameter d. From the narrowest cross-section 3 the yarn channel 4 goes without cross-<br>
sectional jump into an acceleration channel 11 and then gets expanded in trumpet-shape,<br>
whereby the trumpet-shape can be defined with a radius R. On account of the adjusting<br>
supersonic flow, a corresponding impact front diameter DAE can be determined. On the<br>
basis of the impact front diameter DAE, the releasing or tearing point A1, A2, A3 or A4<br>
can be determined in a relatively precise manner. For the effectiveness of the impact<br>
front, refer to the document EP 0 880 611. The acceleration region of the air can also be<br>
defined by the length l2, from the point of the narrowest cross-section 3 and the tearing<br>
point A. As it has to do with a real supersonic flow, one can approximately calculate the<br>
air velocity from it. Fig. 1 shows a conical/tapered design extension of the acceleration<br>
channel 11. which corresponds to the length l2. The opening angle Î±2 is given as 20Â°.<br>
The releasing point A2 is drawn at the end of the supersonic channel, where the yarn<br>
channel goes across into a non-continuous, highly conical/tapered or trumpet-shape<br>
expansion 12 with an opening angle Î´ &gt; 40Â°. On account of the geometry, one obtains an<br>
impact front diameter DAE- AS example one obtains the following equations:<br>
L2/d = 4.2: Vd = 330 m/sec. (Mach 1); DAE ~ 2.5 â MDE = Mach 3.2<br>
d<br>
An extension of the acceleration channel 11 with corresponding opening angle causes an<br>
increase in impact front diameter DAE. Immediately in the region of impact front<br>
formation, one gets the largest possible compression shock front 13 with subsequent<br>
abrupt pressure increase zone 14. The actual texturing takes place in the region of the<br>
compression shock front 13. The air moves faster than the yarn by the factor 50.<br>
Through many experiments it could be determined that the releasing point A3, A4 can<br>
also wander into the acceleration channel 11 when the feed pressure is reduced. In<br>
practice one has to determine the optimum feed pressure for each yarn, whereby the<br>
length (l2) of the acceleration channel is designed for the worst case, i.e. rather selected<br><br>
somewhat too long. MB denotes the centre line of the blow-in hole 15 and MGK denotes<br>
the centre line of the yarn channel 4, and SM denotes the intersection point of MGK and<br>
MB. Pd is the point with narrowest cross-section at the beginning of the acceleration<br>
channel 11, l2 is the distance from SM to Pd, l2 is the distance from Pd up to the end of<br>
the acceleration channel (A*). Loff denotes the length of the yarn-opening zone; Ltex<br>
denotes the length of the yarn-texturing zone. The greater the angle p, the more yarn-<br>
opening zone gets enlarged backwards.<br>
Now reference is made to fig. 2, which shows a preferred design form of a complete<br>
nozzle core 5 in cross-section. The outer fitting-in shape is adapted precisely to the<br>
nozzle cores according to the state-of-the-art technology. This primarily pertains to the<br>
critical installation dimensions, the hole diameter BD, the total length L, the nozzle head<br>
height KH and the distance LA for the compressed air connections PP'. The experiments<br>
have shown that a blow-in angle Î² greater than 48Â° is optimum. The distance X of the<br>
corresponding compressed air holes 15 is critical with reference to the acceleration<br>
channel. The nozzle core 5 has in the inlet region of the yarn, arrow 16, a yarn-inserting<br>
cone 6. The mass "X" (fig. 6) indicates that the compressed air hole 15 is shifted back<br>
from the narrowest cross-section 3 by approximately the magnitude of the diameter d.<br>
Viewed in transportation direction (arrow 16) the texturing nozzle 1 or the nozzle core 5<br>
has a yarn inserting cone 6, a cylindrical central section 7, a cone 8, which at the same<br>
time corresponds to the acceleration channel 11 as well as an extended texturing chamber<br>
9 The texturing chamber is limited transverse to the flow by a trumpet shape 12, which<br>
could also be designed as an open conical funnel.<br>
Fig. 2 shows;, enlarged several times with respect to the actual size, a two-part nozzle core<br>
5 consisting of a ceramic nozzle core 4 and outer nozzle core jacket 25 with a guiding<br>
body or rebounding body 10. The new nozzle core 5 can be conceived as an<br>
interchangeable core for a nozzle core as per the state-of-the-art technology. Especially<br>
the measurements Bd, EL as installation length, LA + KH and KH are therefore produced<br>
not only identical, but also with the same tolerances. Also, even the trumpet shape in the<br>
outer outlet region is produced identical to that in the state-of-the-art technology, with the<br><br>
corresponding radius R. The rebounding body 10 can have any shape: spherical, ball-<br>
shaped, flat or even like a cup. The exact position of the rebounding body in the outlet<br>
region can be retained, by maintaining the outer dimensions corresponding to an identical<br>
draw-off slot Sp1. The texturing chamber 18 is limited backwards by the acceleration<br>
channel 11. Depending on the height of the selected air pressure, the texturing chamber<br>
can also be enlarged into the acceleration channel. The ceramic nozzle core 24, as in the<br>
state-of-the-art technology, is produced in one piece from a high-value material like<br>
ceramic, and is actually the expensive part of a texturing nozzle. In the case of the new<br>
nozzle it is important that the conical cylindrical wall surface 7 and also the wall surface<br>
19 in the region of the acceleration channel and the opening point of the compressed air<br>
holes 15 into the yarn channel have the highest quality.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a complete nozzle head 21 with a two-part nozzle core 5 and a rebounding<br>
body 10 that is anchored in a known housing 20 and can be adjusted by an arm 22. For<br>
threading in, the rebounding body 10 with the arm 22 is drawn away or swung away from<br>
the working region of the texturing nozzle in a known method, as shown by arrow 23.<br>
The compressed air is guided out of a housing chamber 21 through the compressed air<br>
holes 15. The nozzle core 5 is clamped fixed on to the housing 20 by a clamp bridge 26.<br>
Instead of a ball-shape the rebounding body could also have a cup shape.<br>
Figures 4a, 4b and 4c show a solution as per the state-of-the-art technology<br>
corresponding to EP 0 088 254 with a long yarn-guiding channel 29, through which the<br>
yarn to be textured runs. The yarn-guiding channel 29 is supplied with compressed air<br>
through a radial compressed air hole 15. The blow-in hole 15 forms an angle a of about<br>
48Â° with the axis of the yarn-guiding channel 29. The diameter of the blow-in hole 15 is<br>
11 mm. The yarn-guiding channel 29 has a diameter d1 of 1.5 mm and has a convex<br>
outlet opening expanding outwards. The convex bulge has the shape of a circular arc<br>
with a radius R of 6.5 mm, to which the front face 34 of the texturing nozzle 1 forms a<br>
tangential plane, whereby the contact points of the bulge are with the tangential plane lie<br>
on a circle with a diameter D. The diameter D conforms to the formula D = d1 + 2 R and<br>
thus works out to 14.5 mm. The rebounding body 10 whose diameter d2 is 12.5 mm<br><br>
partly protrudes into the channel outlet opening 35 and, along with the inner wall of the<br>
latter forms a ring slot 31. The yarn 30* coming out of the nozzle is drawn off through<br>
the edge of the outlet opening.<br>
As shown in figures 4a and 4b, a beam 33 is attached to the housing 20 supporting the<br>
nozzle with an axis 32 around which an arm 22 connected fixed to the rebounding body<br>
10 can be swivelled. By swinging the arm 22 the ring slot 32 can be adjusted or the<br>
guiding body can be lifted for threading in. The smooth yarn 30 is fed to the texturing<br>
nozzle 1 through a feeder roller 36 and then drawn off as texture yarn 30* through a<br>
feeder roller 37.<br>
At the left hand bottom side, Fig. 5 shows purely schematically the texturing according to<br>
the state-of-the-art technology as per EP 0 088 254. Two main parameters are thereby<br>
highlighted: an opening zone Oe-Z1 and an impact front diameter DA5 based on a<br>
diameter d and corresponding to a nozzle as described in EP 0 088 254. Opposite to that,<br>
on the top right side, the texturing as per EP 0 880 611 is depicted. It can be clearly<br>
identified that the values Oe-Z2 and DAE are greater. The yarn opening zone Oe-Z2<br>
begins shortly before the acceleration channel in the region of the compressed air feed B<br>
and is already significantly greater with reference to the relatively short yarn opening<br>
zone Oe-Z1 shown in the solution as per EP 0 088 254. The significant statement of fig. 5<br>
lies in the diagrammatic comparison of the yarn tension according to the state-of-the-art<br>
technology (graph T 311) with Mach 
invention (graph S 315) with Mach &gt; 2, as well as the new nozzle. In the Y-axis of the<br>
diagram the yarn tension is in CN. In the X-axis the production speed Pgeschw is shown in<br>
m/min. From the graph T 311 one can identify the clear collapse of the yarn tension over<br>
a production speed of 500 m/min. Above about 650 m/min. the texturing with the nozzle<br>
as per EP 0 088 254 collapsed. In contrast, the graph S 315 shows with the<br>
corresponding nozzle from the document EP 0 880 611, that the yarn tension is not only<br>
much higher but is almost constant in the range of 400 to 700 m/min. and, even in the<br>
higher production range fails only slowly. Increasing the Mach number is one of the<br>
most important parameters for intensifying the texturing. Increasing the blow-in angle is<br><br>
one of the most important parameters for quality in texturing, as shown with the new<br>
nozzle as third example on the top left hand side. As example, the blow-in angle is given<br>
in the range of 50Â° to 60Â°. The yarn-opening zone Oe-Z3 is greater than in the solution on<br>
the top right side (as per EP 0 880 611) and significantly greater than in the solution on<br>
the bottom left hand side (as per EP 0 088 254). The other process-technical process<br>
parameters are same in all three solutions. Apart from the different blow-in angle in the<br>
range of 45Â° to 48Â° and recently above 45Â°, there lies the surprisingly positive effect in<br>
the cross-section of the yarn opening zone, like OZ1 and OZ2 or as has been marked in<br>
the corresponding circles. The external difference lies only in the change of the blow-in<br>
angle. The Mach increase of thread tension begins at an angle of above 48Â° and can be<br>
explained as due to a combination effect. At least as far as one can presently understand<br>
the surprising positive effect, 48Â° blow-in angle denotes a threshold, mainly in texturing<br>
nozzles as per EP 0 880 611. This texturing nozzle type has a sufficient capacity reserve,<br>
so that even slight intensification of the yarn opening gets translated into an increase in<br>
yarn quality.<br>
In practice, the textured yarn runs after the second feeder roller through a quality sensor,<br>
e.g. having the market brand HemaQuality, called ATQ, in which the pull force of the<br>
yarn 30* (in cN) as well as the variation in momentary pull force (Sigma %) is measured.<br>
The measured signals are fed to a computing unit. The corresponding quality<br>
measurement is a pre-requisite for the optimum monitoring of the production. The values<br>
are also an indicator for the yarn quality. In the air blast texturing process the quality<br>
determination becomes difficult, because there is no defined loop size. One can rather<br>
determine the variation with respect to the quality considered as good by the client. This<br>
is possible with the ATQ system as the yarn structure and its variation can be determined<br>
by a thread tension sensor, then evaluated and displayed as a single characteristic factor,<br>
i.e. the AT-value. A thread tension sensor determines particularly the thread pull force<br>
after the texturing nozzle as analogous electrical signals. From the average value and<br>
variance of the measured values of the thread pull force, the AT-value can be<br>
continuously calculated. The magnitude of the AT-value is dependent on the structure of<br>
the yarn and is determined by the user according to his own quality requirement. If the<br><br>
pull force of the thread or the variance (uniformity) of the thread tension changes during<br>
production, the AT-value also changes. The upper and lower limit values can be<br>
determined with yarn mirrors, knit samples or fabric samples. They are different for<br>
different quality specifications. The advantage of ATQ-measurement is that different<br>
types of defects can be simultaneously detected from the process, e.g. position uniformity<br>
of texturing, thread wetting, filament cracks, dirtying of the nozzle, rebounding ball<br>
distance, Hotpin-temperature, air pressure differences, POY-pin zone, yarn feed etc.<br>
Let us now refer to figures 6a and 6b. Both the figures show the "framework" for the<br>
nozzle function during production of loop yarn. Fig. 6a is based on the solution as shown<br>
in figures 4a to 4c. Fig. 6b is based on the solution as shown in figures 1, 2 and 3. The<br>
corresponding parts of both figures are marked with the same reference signs. Both the<br>
figures 6a and 6b show the size proportions of the individual regions for the nozzle<br>
functions.<br>
Fig. 6a shows clearly that the cylindrical section zyl.A is approx. twice as long as the<br>
expansion section EA. Three radial blow-in holes 15 are staggered by a distance 6.A<br>
with respect to the opening section and the expansion section EA, and lie in the central<br>
region of the cylindrical section, as drawn according to the blow-in section (Einbl. A). In<br>
the expansion section EA, the diameter D and the radius R are of great importance. The<br>
cylindrical section has a diameter Gd. A further special feature of the solution as shown<br>
in fig. 6a is the angle a, which in the transportation direction of the yarn as indicated by<br>
the arrow 16 has an angle of approx. 48Â°. A feeding cone EK is only as long as required<br>
for threading in, but is however very short. The diameter Bd is dimensioned according to<br>
the state-of-the-art technology. A comparison of figures 4a and 6a clearly shows that the<br>
cylindrical section (zyl.A) of the new solution is less than half the length, in comparison<br>
to the solution of the state-of-the-art technology as shown in fig. 4a. This is an important<br>
teature for the concrete design extension of a ceramic nozzle core as per the invention.<br>
Considering the texturing function, in the state-of-the-art technology the length of the<br>
yarn-guiding channel has been conceived unnecessarily long. The yarn-guiding channel<br><br>
GA in the state-of-the-art technology is oriented according to the thickness measurement<br>
of the housing 20, as one can clearly see from the figure 4b.<br>
As compared to fig. 6a, fig. 6b shows two particular features. The solution as shown in<br>
fig. 6b has at the point of a trumpet-shaped section EA a first conical/tapered section<br>
(Kon A.) as well as a trumpet-shaped texturing section TA*, according to the solution<br>
described in EP-PS 0 880 611. A comparison of the figures 6a and 6b shows that the<br>
cylindrical section zyl. A* shown in fig. 6b is designed shortened, according to the data<br>
X1 and X2. As gain, the opening section Ã¶A* in fig. 6b is designed enlarged. The<br>
conical/tapered section is preferably designed with an opening angle Ï of 12Â° to 40Â°. The<br>
second special feature lies in the arrangement of the radial blow-in hole 15, with an angle<br>
Î² of preferably 50Â° to 70Â°, which increases the stability of texturing to a very high level<br>
and ensures best texturing qualities.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further particularly advantageous extension, which is based on EP-PS 1<br>
022 366. Practice shows that air blast texturing nozzles for production of loop yarn have<br>
to be cleaned at relatively short time intervals. The document EP-PS 1 022 366 now<br>
suggests that the nozzle core be staggered continuously or alternately in rotation. In this<br>
way it was possible to significantly extend the cleaning interval. Fig. 7 shows how the<br>
new invention can also be used in a rotary driven nozzle core. It is additionally<br>
recommended to use a two-part nozzle core, as shown in fig. 2. Fig.7 shows as example<br>
the simultaneous binding and texturing of two yarns, a yarn A and a yarn B, which are<br>
fed into the yarn feeding cone 6 respectively through a thread guide 40 or 41. The nozzle<br>
core consists of a ceramic nozzle core 24 and an outer nozzle core jacket 25 which is<br>
attached in a rotating supported rotation sleeve 42, which in turn is supported in the drive<br>
housing 44 by ball bearings 43. The compressed air is fed through a compressed air<br>
chamber 45 and a compressed air connection 46, whereby weakening of compressed air<br>
is prevented by several sealings 47. A worm gear 48 is held in the drive housing 44 by a<br>
collar 49 and a cover 50. A drive shaft 51, a transmission gear 52 and a worm gear 48<br>
activate the drive.<br><br>
