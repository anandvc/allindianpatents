PEPTIDIC GROWTH HORMONE SECRETAGOGUES ANALOG COMPOUNDS<br>
AND PREPARATIONS THEREOF.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention can be described in the field of rational design of biologically 5<br>
active molecular entities regulating the metabolic activity and cytoprotection of the<br>
organisms. More specifically on compounds analog to peptidic growth hormone<br>
secretagogues whose activity includes but it is not restricted to: the controlled<br>
release of growth hormone, cardioprotection, the increase of the functional response<br>
of the cardiovascular system, neuroprotection, appetite regulation and control, fat 10<br>
intake and energetic metabolism.<br>
Previous art<br>
The synthetic growth hormone (GH) secretagogues consist of a family of ligands<br>
including peptidic and non peptidic molecules, being first described by Momany and 15<br>
Bowers before the isolation of GH releasing hormone (GHRH) synthetic peptides of<br>
6 and 7 amino acids resulting into potent GH releasing peptides (GHRPs); such<br>
peptides were described prior to the knowledge of its function in the organism or<br>
their way of action. Mutational studies and in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed<br>
that the two amino acid arrangement L-D and D-L separated by one amino acid 20<br>
acting as spacer, was considered optimal for the GH releasing activity, and<br>
peptide(His-D-Trp-Ala-D-Trp-Phe-NH2) was conformed releasing GH at a<br>
concentration of 10 to 30 ng/mL reaching to a peptide known as GHRP-6 (His-D-Trp-<br>
Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) where the Lys residue was needed only to improve the in<br>
vivo activity because it was not deemed as functional in vitro (Momany F.A., Bowers 25<br>
C.Y., et. al. (1981) Design, synthesis and biological activity of peptides which release<br>
growth hormone, in vitro. Endocrinology, 108:31-39).<br>
Other analog peptides were discovered; in 1993 Bowers et al. discovered two<br>
GHRP-6 analog peptides, el GHRP-2 (D-Ala-D-ß-Nal-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) y el<br>
GHRP-1 (Ala-His-D-ß-Nal-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2). This three secretagogues 30<br>
showed and increased GH release in vitro from incubated hypothalamus-pituitary<br>
that from the pituitary gland alone, demonstrating that the hypothalamic impulse was<br>
important in such action, also it was demonstrated, even in humans that the<br>
synergistic action of GHRP and GHRH released more GH than any of the two by<br>
2<br>
itself (Bowers C.Y. (1993) GH-releasing peptides: structure and kinetics. J Pediatr<br>
Endocrinol, 6(1):21-31).<br>
From the peptide known as GHRP-2 new cyclic peptides were, by the change of Nterminal<br>
D-Ala by an amino acid having the side chain linked to another amino acid<br>
inserted between D-Phe and Lys. One of such peptides (D-Lys-D-ß-Nal-Ala-Trp-D- 5<br>
Phe-Glu-Lys-NH2) resulted in to a 10 fold increased activity in vitro and a<br>
comparable efficacy in vivo to GHRP-6 (McDowell R.S., et al. (1995) Growth<br>
hormone secretagogues: characterization, efficacy, and minimal bioactive<br>
conformation. PNAS USA, 92(24):11165-11169). The experiments were completed<br>
with structural studies in solution of the DL cyclic peptides reaching to the conclusion 10<br>
that the introduction of D amino acids in the peptidic compounds was essentially<br>
needed to elicit the desired activity. Other investigations were directed to find active<br>
molecules with an increased oral bioavailability and longer clearance times, yielding<br>
the discoveries of new GHRPs and other non peptidic molecules. In 1993, the first<br>
non peptidic GH secretagogue was described (Smith R.G., et al. (1993) A 15<br>
nonpeptidyl growth hormone secretagogue. Science, 260:1640-43), and later is<br>
referred the synthesis of a non peptidic and more potent GHS, MK-0677, having a<br>
high bioavailability and able to stimulate GH secretion 24 h after a single dose oral<br>
administration (Patchett A.A., Nargund R.P., et al. (1995) Design and biological<br>
activities of L-163,191 (MK-0677): a potent, orally active growth hormone 20<br>
secretagogue. PNAS USA, 92:7001-7005; Smith R.G., Van der Ploeg L.H., et al.<br>
(1997) Peptidomimetic regulation of growth hormone secretion. Endocr. Rev,<br>
18:621-645). More recently another peptidomimetic GHS was designed with a<br>
selective and potent GH releasing activity (EP1572) showing a GH secretagogue<br>
receptor (GHS-R) binding potency in human and animal tissues similar to that of 25<br>
ghrelin and peptidic GHS inducing a marked increase in GH after the subcutaneous<br>
administration to newborn rats (Broglio F., Boutignon F., et al. (2002) EP1572: a<br>
novel peptido-mimetic GH secretagogue with potent and selective GH-releasing<br>
activity in man. J Endocrinol Invest, 25:RC26-RC28).<br>
In 1999 ghrelin was discovered as a 28 amino acid peptide produced mainly in the 30<br>
stomach, however finding also its mARN in several other tissues. It is produced in<br>
the stomach by the X/A cells which are the major population of endocrine cells in the<br>
oxintic mucosa. Ghrelin is also found in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus where its<br>
RNA is present in NPY and AGRP neurons, involved in to the appetite control and<br>
3<br>
the energetic balance (Kojima M., Hosoda H., et al. (1999) Ghrelin is a growthhormone-<br>
releasing acylated peptide from stomach. Nature, 402:656-60; Nakazato<br>
M., Murakami N., et al. (2001) A role for ghrelin in the central regulation of feeding.<br>
Nature, 409:194-198). Its RNA has been also localized in pancreas and intestine. It<br>
circulates in the bloodstream of adult humans on a concentration of 100-120 fmol/ml, 5<br>
suggesting that is secreted by the stomach cells and it may act by an endocrine<br>
pathway. The production of ghrelin has been also reported in neoplastic tissues<br>
(Takaya K., Ariyasu H., et al. (2000) Ghrelin strongly stimulates growth hormone<br>
release in humans. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab, 85:4908-11; Papotti M., et al. (2001)<br>
Substantial production of ghrelin by a human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line. J 10<br>
Clin Endoc. Metab, 86:4984–4990).<br>
Other animal studies showed that the secretion of ghrelin is pulsatile and more<br>
associated to appetite to the GH pulses (Tolle V., Bassant M.H., et al. (2002)<br>
Ultradian rhythmicity of ghrelin secretion in relation with GH, feeding behaviour, and<br>
sleep wake patterns in rats. Endocrinology, 143:1353-1361). 15<br>
Ghrelin is the first natural hormone being found with a hydroxyl group of one of the<br>
serines acylated with octanoic acid. This modification has being described as<br>
essential for the binding to GHS-R1a, as well as for the GH releasing capacity, and<br>
probably to other endocrine actions.<br>
Non acylated ghrelin circulates in major amounts tan the acylated, although it was 20<br>
not described a direct endocrine action it is regarded as acting in other nonendocrine<br>
functions like cardiovascular effects, cardioprotective, antiproliferatives,<br>
and cytoprotecting in general, probably mediated by the binding to other subtypes of<br>
GHS-R (Matsumoto M., Hosoda H., et al. (2001) Structure-activity relationship of<br>
ghrelin: pharmacological study of ghrelin peptides. Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 25<br>
287:142-146; Hosoda H., Kojima M., et al. (2000) Ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin: two<br>
major forms of rat ghrelin peptide in gastrointestinal tissue. Biochem Biophys Res<br>
Commun, 279:909-913; Cassoni P., Papotti M., et al. (2001) Identification,<br>
characterization, and biological activity of specific receptors for natural (ghrelin) and<br>
synthetic growth hormone secretagogues and analogs in human breast carcinomas 30<br>
and cell lines. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 86:1738-1745).<br>
There is another endogenous Ligand for GHS-R1a that can be isolated from the<br>
stomach endocrine mucosa, des-Gln14-ghrelin as the result of an alternative<br>
4<br>
processing of the ghrelin gene losing Gln14 and as ghrelin it does experiment the<br>
same acylation process on Ser3.<br>
Studies made with several ghrelin analogs having the third residue modified with<br>
several aliphatic or aromatic groups and several short peptides derived from the<br>
ghrelin side chain showed that the hydrophobic groups in residue 3 are essential to 5<br>
the activity. Also has been observed the short segments containing the first five<br>
residues of ghrelin are capable of activating the receptor with a comparable<br>
efficiency to the whole peptide. Tetra peptides were shown to be less potent and<br>
fragments lacking the N-Terminal were unable to activate the receptor (Bednarek<br>
M.A., Feighner S.D., et al. (2000) Structure-Function Studies on the New Growth 10<br>
Hormone-Releasing Peptide, Ghrelin: Minimal Sequence of Ghrelin Necessary for<br>
Activation of Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor 1a. J Med Chem, 43: 4370-<br>
4376; Silva Elipe M.V., Bednarek M.A., et al. (2001) 1H NMR structural analysis of<br>
human ghrelin and its six truncated analogs. Biopolymers, 59:489-501). Such<br>
studies suggested that the complete ghrelin sequence is not essential for the activity 15<br>
and Gly-Ser-Ser(n-octanoyl)-Phe is the active fragment in the activity as agonist of<br>
GHS-R1a.<br>
Before and after the discovery of ghrelin a great effort was made to find small<br>
molecules and derivatives that can be ligands of the GHS-R an important number of<br>
patents described molecules of such type (US Pats: US 3,239,345; 4,036,979; 20<br>

(2002) Recent developments in ghrelin receptor (GHS-. R1a) agonists and<br>
5<br>
antagonists Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 12:1599-1618) After such extensive revision<br>
other compounds has been described as antagonists of the GHS-R (US2005288316<br>
y WO2005048916) and others described to also bind to GHS-R and used with<br>
various purposes. (WO2005046682; WO2005039625; JP2003335752;<br>
US2004009984; US2003130284; WO03004518) More recently a new series of 5<br>
macro cyclic compounds was added to the set with the main purpose of being<br>
agonists of GHS-R without eliciting the release of GH (US2006025566)<br>
GHS-R is a class A G-coupled protein receptor, expressed by a single gene in the<br>
chromosomal 3q26.2 locus in humans. Two types of cDNA were identified result of<br>
the alternative processing of the pre-mRNA (McKee K.K., Tan C.P., et al. (1997) 10<br>
Cloning and characterization of two human G protein-coupled receptor genes<br>
(GPR38 and GPR39) related to the growth hormone secretagogue and neurotensin<br>
receptors. Genomics, 46:426-434; McKee K.K., Palyha O.C., et al. (1997) Molecular<br>
analysis of rat pituitary and hypothalamic growth hormone secretagogue receptors.<br>
Mol Endocrinol, 11:415-423; US 6,242,199; WO 97/21730). cDNA 1a encode a 366 15<br>
amino acid receptor with seven transmembrane segments (GHS-R1a). cDNA 1b<br>
encodes a shorter protein (GHS-R1b) having 289 amino acids and five<br>
transmembrane segments. Although the role of GHS-R1b is yet unknown, it has<br>
been proved the expression in several endocrine and non-endocrine tissue (Howard<br>
A.D., Feighner S.D., et al. (1996) A receptor in pituitary and hypothalamus that 20<br>
functions in growth hormone release. Science, 273:974-977; Gnanapavan S., Kola<br>
B., et al. (2002) The tissue distribution of the mRNA of ghrelin and subtypes of its<br>
receptor, GHS-R, in humans. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 87:2988; Smith R.G., Leonard<br>
R., et al. (2001) Growth hormone secretagogue receptor family members and<br>
ligands. Endocrine, 14:9-14). 25<br>
The human GHS-R1a has a 96 and 93% identity with those of the rat and swine<br>
respectively, and a close relation has been shown between the sequence of human<br>
GHS-R1a and those of telosteous fish. Such findings suggest that GHS-R1a is highly<br>
conserved between species and probably exert an essential biological function.<br>
(Palyha O.C., Feighner S.D., et al. (2000) Ligand activation domain of human orphan 30<br>
growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) conserved from pufferfish to<br>
humans. Mol Endocrinol. 14:160-169).<br>
The binding of ghrelin and synthetic GHS to GHS-R1a activates the phospholipase C<br>
signalling pathway, increasing the concentration of inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3),<br>
6<br>
and protein kinase C (PKS) activation, followed by the release of Ca 2+ from the<br>
intracellular stores. The activation of GHS-R also inhibits the K+, channels allowing<br>
the intake of Ca 2+ through L type voltage gated channels but not of type T.<br>
Differently to GHS-R1a, GHS-R1b does not bind or responds to GHS and its function<br>
is yet unknown. (Chen C., Wu D., et al. (1996) Signal transduction systems 5<br>
employed by synthetic GH-releasing peptides in somatotrophs. J Endocrinol.<br>
148:381-386; Casanueva F.F., Dieguez C. (1999) Neuroendocrine regulation and<br>
actions of leptin. Front Neuroendocrinol, 20:317-363; Howard A.D., Feighner S.D., et<br>
al. (1996) A receptor in pituitary and hypothalamus that functions in growth hormone<br>
release. Science, 273:974-977). 10<br>
Synthetic GHS, ghrelin and its natural isoform (des-Gln14-ghrelin) bind with high<br>
affinity to GHS-R1a, and the efficiency on displacing membrane bound [35S] MK-<br>
0677 or [125I] [Tyr4]ghrelin is correlated to the concentration required to stimulate GH<br>
release (Muccioli G., Papotti M., et al. (2001) Binding of 125I-labeled ghrelin to<br>
membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland. J Endocrinol Invest. 15<br>
24:RC7-RC9; Hosoda H., Kojima M., et al. (2000) Purification and characterization of<br>
rat des-Gln14-ghrelin, a second endogenous ligand for the growth hormone<br>
secretagogue receptor. J Biol Chem, 275:21995–22000).<br>
To determine the essential structural characteristics of ghrelin for the binding and<br>
activation of GHS-R1a, short ghrelin peptides were studies in HEK-293 cells, 20<br>
expressing human GHS-R1a observing that 4 and 5 amino acid ghrelin N-terminal<br>
peptides were able to activate the receptor. Based on this in vitro results it is<br>
postulated that Gly-Ser-Ser(n-octanoyl)-Phe is essentially required for the activation<br>
of the receptor (Van der Lely A.J., Tschop M., et al. (2004) Biological, Physiological,<br>
Pathophysiological, and Pharmacological Aspects of Ghrelin. Endocrine Reviews, 25<br>
25(3):426-457). The first 7 amino acid of ghrelin are conserved among all studied<br>
species, however the ability of ghrelin derivatives to activate GHS-R1a in transfected<br>
cells does not seems an indication for the capacity to stimulate GH release in<br>
somatotroph cells, recently it was shown that (1-4) and (1-8) octanoyl ghrelin are not<br>
able to stimulate the release of GH in rats and were not effective displacing [125I] 30<br>
[Tyr4] ghrelin from the binding site in preparations of human pituitary or hypothalamic<br>
membranes (Torsello A., Ghe C., et. al. (2002) Short ghrelin peptides neither<br>
displace ghrelin binding in vitro nor stimulate GH release in vivo. Endocrinology,<br>
143:1968–1971). Other study on the same cells expressing human or swine GHS7<br>
R1a it was found that adenosine also activates the receptor, but like the short ghrelin<br>
analogs can not stimulate the GH secretion, suggesting that adenosine is a partial<br>
agonist of GHS-R1a bound to a different site in the receptor that MK-0677 or GHRP-<br>
6 (Smith R.G., Griffin P.R., et. al. (2000) Adenosine: a partial agonist of the growth<br>
hormone secretagogue receptor. Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 276:1306–1313). 5<br>
More recently has been reported that GHS-R1a can also bind cortistatin (CST), a<br>
somatostatin (SS) homolog neuropeptide not being able by itself to recognize GHSR1a<br>
(Deghenghi R., Papotti M., et. al. (2001) Cortistatin, but not somatostatin, binds<br>
to growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptors of human pituitary gland. J<br>
Endocrinol Invest, 24:RC1–RC3). GHS-R1a is expressed in the arcuate nucleus and 10<br>
pituitary somatotroph cells, crucial zones for neuroendocrine and appetite stimulation<br>
activities of ghrelin and synthetic GHS. (Willesen M.G., Kristensen P., Romer J.<br>

GHS-R1a mRNA has been detected in extra hypothalamic areas like the dented<br>

Ghrelin ad GHS have a high affinity to GHS-R1a. However there are evidences of<br>
other additional sites for GHS. Specific sites for Tyr-Ala-hexarelin and other GHS<br>
with a similar receptor density at least equal to the density found in pituitary has 10<br>
been found in human and rat heart and many other non endocrine peripheral tissues<br>
like: lungs, arteries, skeletal muscles, kidney, and liver (Muccioli G., Ghe C., et. al.<br>

al. (2000) Growth hormone secretagogue binding sites in peripheral human tissues.<br>
J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 85:3803–3807). Such binding sites showed low affinity for<br>
ghrelin and are probably not ghrelin receptors but peptide ghrelin analog receptors.<br>
Heart GHS-R has a higher (84 kDa) molecular weight than GHS-R1a and no 25<br>
sequence homology, the predicted amino acid sequence for the receptor in the heart<br>
is similar to CD36 (Papotti M., Ghe C., et. al. (2000) Growth hormone secretagogue<br>
binding sites in peripheral human tissues. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 85:3803–3807;<br>
Bodart V., Febbraio M., et. al. (2002) CD36 mediates the cardiovascular action of<br>
growth hormone-releasing peptides in the heart. Circ Res, 90:844–849). The 30<br>
functional meaning of peripheral tissue GHS receptors and findings in the<br>
cardiovascular system suggest that such binding sites modulate the cardioprotective<br>
activities of peptidic GHS.<br>
9<br>
Ghrelin an other synthetic secretagogues stimulate the release of GH by the<br>
somatotroph cells in vitro probably by membrane depolarization and by the<br>
increment of the GH secreted per cell, reporting also a stimulatory effect of GHS on<br>
the GH synthesis.(Kojima M., Hosoda H., et. al. (1999) Ghrelin is a growth-hormonereleasing<br>

Early studies showed GHS stimulating the GH secretion using a different receptor<br>
and pathway the GHRH: An antagonist of the GHRH receptor inhibits the GHRH 15<br>
elicited GH secretion, but not the release of GHRH stimulated by secretagogues and<br>
an alleged GHS-R antagonist does not affect the GH release in response to GHRH,<br>
GHRP-6 does not compete with GHRH in receptor binding assays for GHRH binding<br>
sites, there is an additive effect on the GH release upon the co administration of<br>
GHS and GHRH, and there is no crossed desensitation between GHRH and GHS in 20<br>
terms of GH release. (Wu D., Chen C., et al. (1994) The effect of GH-releasing<br>

The GH releasing activity of GHS is larger in pituitary-hypothalamus preparations tan<br>
in isolated pituitary, in agreement with the evidence of the larger in vivo GH<br>
stimulating effects. (Mazza E., Ghigo E., et. al. (1989) Effect of the potentiation of<br>

On the hypothalamic level, ghrelin and GHS act upon the GHRH secretor neurons<br>
and incremented levels of GHRH has been observed in the pituitary portal circulation<br>
after the administration of GHS in sheep. (Conley L.K., Teik J.A., et. al. (1995) 5<br>

and somatostatin in the rat. Neuroendocrinology, 61:44–50; Guillaume V., Magnan<br>
E., et. al. (1994) Growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone secretion is stimulated by<br>
a new GH-releasing hexapeptide in sheep. Endocrinology, 135:1073–1076).<br>
GHS requires of GHRH to fully express its GH releasing effect, in humans the GH 10<br>
response is inhibited by GHRH receptor antagonists, and by pituitary-hypothalamic<br>
disconnection. (Bluet-Pajot M.T., Tolle V., et al. (2001) Growth hormone<br>
secretagogues and hypothalamic networks. Endocrine, 14:1–8; 148:371–380;<br>

hormone release is exerted at hypothalamic level. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 88:3450- 15<br>
3453). Patients with a deficiency on the GHRH receptor do not show an increase in<br>
GH secretion as a response to GHS stimulation but keep the capacity to increase the<br>
cortisol, ACTH and PRL after the GHS stimulation. (Maheshwari H.G., Pezzoli S.S.,<br>
et al. (2002) Pulsatile growth hormone secretion persists in genetic growth hormonereleasing<br>
hormone resistance. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab, 282:E943-E951; 20<br>

and humans there is evidence of GHS and GHRH induced homologous but not<br>
heterologous desensitation, GHS activity homologous desensitation has been shown<br>
during GHS infusion, but not on the intermittent daily oral or nasal administration of<br>
the peptide for more than 15 days. (Ghigo E., Arvat E., et al. (1994) Growth 30<br>

intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, and oral administration in man. J Clin<br>

administration of intranasal or oral hexarelin, a synthetic hexapeptide, does not<br>
11<br>
desensitize the growth hormone responsiveness in human aging. Eur J Endocrinol,<br>
135:407–412). On the other hand the parenteral, intranasal or oral administration of<br>
GHS increases the GH spontaneous pulse and raises the IGF-1 levels in young<br>
healthy adults, like in children and elderly subjects. (Chapman I.M., Bach M.A., et al.<br>

2782; Laron Z., Frenkel J., et al. (1995) Intranasal administration of the GHRP<br>
hexarelin accelerates growth in short children. Clin Endocrinol (Oxf), 43:631–635).<br>
Ghrelin is capable of stimulating the appetite in rats and this property could be<br>
mediates by the syntheses of NPY and AGRP. Intraventricular ghrelin is also<br>
capable of nullifying the anorexigenic effects of leptin, and is postulated that there is 15<br>
a competitive interaction between this two peptides on appetite and energy<br>
homeostasis control. The circulating concentrations of ghrelin in the rat are<br>
augmented upon fasting and are smaller after feeding or glucose ingestion (Shintani<br>
M., Ogawa Y., et al. (2001) Ghrelin, an endogenous growth hormone secretagogue,<br>
is a novel orexigenic peptide that antagonizes leptin action through the activation of 20<br>
hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/Y1 receptor pathway. Diabetes, 50:227-32; Nakazato<br>

induces adiposity in rodents. Nature, 407:908-13).<br>
GHS also stimulate appetite and weight gain. Chronic treatment with GHRP-2 25<br>
stimulate the accumulation of adipose tissue in NPY deficient mice and increase the<br>
hypothalamic expression of AGRP mRNA in the controls (Torsello, A., Luoni, M., et<br>
al. (1998) Novel hexarelin analogs stimulate feeding in the rat through a mechanism<br>
not involving growth hormone release. Eur. J. Pharmacol, 360:123-129; Ghigo, E.,<br>

crucial mediating role of hypothalamic agouti-related protein. Endocrinology,<br>
143:558–568).<br>
12<br>
Ghrelin administration to rats yield gain in appetite and weight by a significative<br>
increment on the fat tissue without observing changes in the lean mass, bone tissue<br>
or growth stimulation. The lipogenic effect of ghrelin is independent of the GH action,<br>
and it can be found in a genetically GH deficient rat. GH elicits an increment in the<br>
energy expenditure and causes fat elimination, allowing for a balance with ghrelin, 5<br>
ghrelin increases the fat tissue and GH does not allow a decrease in the lean tissue.<br>
(Nakazato M., Murakami N., et al. (2001) A role for ghrelin in the central regulation of<br>
feeding. Nature, 409(6817):194-198; Wren A.M., Small C.J., et al. (2000) The novel<br>
hypothalamic peptide ghrelin stimulates food intake and growth hormone secretion.<br>

Ghrelin induces adiposity in rodents. Nature, 407:980-913).<br>
In obese individuals ghrelin levels are depleted and does not decrease after feeding,<br>
this is a reversible condition, because weight loss and ghrelin mean plasma levels<br>
are incremented. Plasma levels of ghrelin negatively correlate to the body weight<br>
index, the body fat weight, the size of the adiposities and the plasma levels of insulin, 15<br>
glucose and leptin (English P.J., Ghatei M.A., et. al. (2002) Food fails to suppress<br>
ghrelin levels in obese humans. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 87(6):2984; Tschop M.,<br>
Weyer C., et. al. (2001) Circulating ghrelin levels are decreased in human obesity.<br>
Diabetes, 50(4):707-9).<br>
GH insufficiency in obese patients has been reported as reversible after a prolonged 20<br>
diet and a marked weight loss. The chronic increase on the free fatty acids and<br>
hyperinsulinism associated with the low ghrelin levels may have an important role<br>
causing GH insufficiency in obesity. (Maccario M., Tassone F., Grottoli S., Rossetto<br>
R., Gauna C., Ghigo E. (2002) Neuroendocrine and metabolic determinants of the<br>
adaptation of GH/IGF-I axis to obesity. Ann Endocrinol (Paris), 63(2 Pt 1):140-144). 25<br>
As ghrelin is being found adipogenic and orexigenic it can be thought on<br>
antagonizing it for obesity treatment, however the consequences of such antagonism<br>
lower the GH secretion and are associated with the fat mass increase. (Jorgensen<br>
J.O., Vahl N., (1996) Influence of growth hormone and androgens on body<br>
composition in adults. Horm Res, 45:94-98). Long term administration of agonists or 30<br>
antagonists of ghrelin will reveal which of the two effects dominates and determine<br>
its influence on the energy balance.<br>
In the obese man the circulating concentrations of ghrelin are diminished and<br>
negatively correlated to the body fat tissue and the circulating levels of insulin and<br>
13<br>
leptin (Tschöp M., Weyer C., et. al. (2001) Circulating ghrelin levels are decreased in<br>
human obesity. Diabetes, 50:707-9).<br>
GH/IGF-I axis has a very important role during cardiac development and for the<br>
maintenance of the structure and function or the heart; deterioration on the<br>
cardiovascular performance is one of the symptoms of GH deficiency that can be 5<br>
reverted with a GH therapy. (Sacca L, Cittadini A, Fazio S (1994) Growth hormone<br>
and the heart. Endocr Rev 15:555–573; Caidahl K, Eden S, Bengtsson BÅ 1994<br>
Cardiovascular and renal effects of growth hormone. Clin Endocrinol (Oxf) 40:393–<br>
400).<br>
There are experimental data showing an improvement on the performance of the 10<br>
cardiac muscle due to GH, among them many studies using a myocardial infarction<br>
(MI) model in rats, GH treatment after MI resulted in an increment on the systolic<br>
ejection volume, cardiac output and other systolic variables, along with a pronounced<br>
vasodilation and a lower total peripheral resistance due to GH/IGF-I, probably<br>
contributing to improve the myocardial contractility. (Timsit J, Riou B, et al. 1990 15<br>
Effects of chronic growth hormone hypersecretion on intrinsic contractility,<br>
energetics, isomyosin pattern and myosin adenosine triphosphate activity of rat left<br>
ventricle. J Clin Invest 86:507–515; Tajima M, et al. (1999) Treatment with growth<br>
hormone enhances contractile reserve and intracellular calcium transients in<br>
myocytes from rats with post infarction heart failure. Circulation 99:127-134). 20<br>
On the other hand, animal models with an excess of GH display a shift to a myosin<br>
isoform with a low adenosine triphosphatase activity, they might lower the energy<br>
demand on the contraction process. (Timsit J, Riou B, et al. (1990) Effects of chronic<br>
growth hormone hypersecretion on intrinsic contractility, energetics, isomyosin<br>
pattern and myosin adenosine triphosphate activity of rat left ventricle. J Clin Invest 25<br>
86:507–515).<br>
There are several studies on the cardiac and peripheral effects of GH and/or IGF-I,<br>
among them good clinical data pointing to a future role of GH/IGF-I on the<br>
cardiovascular therapy. (Fazio S., Sabatini D., et al. (1996) A preliminary study of<br>
growth hormone in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. N Engl J Med, 334:809- 30<br>
814).<br>
Several synthetic GHS and ghrelin have cardioprotective properties in several in vivo<br>
studies improving several cardiac function variables, having a comparable effect with<br>
those of GH. The likelihood of hexarelin haemodinamic profile with those of GH<br>
14<br>
could suggest that GHS action is mediated by GH, recent studies however support a<br>
direct action on the heart. (Locatelli V., Rossoni G., (1999) Growth Hormone<br>
independent cardioprotective effects of hexarelin in the rat. Endocrinology,<br>
140:4024-4031; Tivesten Å., Bollano E., (2000) The growth hormone secretagogue<br>
hexarelin improves cardiac function in rats after experimental myocardial infarction. 5<br>
Endocrinology, 141:60-66).<br>
GHS-R1a mRNA has been found in aorta and heart, and it is also increased in<br>
cardiomyocyte cultures after preincubation with hexarelin (Gnanapavan S., Kola B.,<br>
et al. (2002) The tissue distribution of the mRNA of ghrelin and subtypes of its<br>
receptor, GHS-R, in humans. J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 87: 2988-2991; Nagoya N., 10<br>

Specific ghrelin binding sites have been identified in rat heart and human arteries,<br>
where the receptor density is increased by atherosclerosis and radioactively labelled<br>
peptidic GHS were found specifically bound to rat myocardial cells and several<br>
human cardiovascular tissues (ventricle, auricle, aorta, coronaries, carotid,<br>
endocardium and vena cava), in higher amount than to the pituitary (Katugampola 20<br>

Even though the administration of high pharmacological doses of peptidic GHS<br>
induce a clear but transient vasoconstriction in perfunded rat heart using young rats 30<br>
with induced GH deficiency by immunization with GHRH, has been also found that<br>
hexarelin can protect against the myocardial damage induced by ischemia ad<br>
reperfusion, such protective activity has been associated to prostacyclin release and<br>
the recovery of Angiotensin II vasopressor activity. (Bodart V., Febbario M., et al.<br>
15<br>
(2000) CD36 mediates the cardiovascular action of growth hormone-releasing<br>
peptides in the heart. Circ Res, 90:844-849; de Gennaro Colonna V., Rossoni G., et<br>

ischemia and impairment of vascular endothelium function in hearts from growth<br>
hormone-deficient rats: protection by hexarelin. Eur J Pharmacol, 334:201-207).<br>
Similar results are obtained in aged rats in which treatment with hexarelin resulted in<br>
a strong protection against the post ischemic ventricular dysfunction. Complete<br>
recovery of the cardiac function was observed in the reperfusion and the 10<br>
simultaneous reduction in the creatine kinase levels corroborated the integrity of the<br>
heart membranes and the preservation of the contractile weakness following the<br>
oxygen readmission. The hexarelin protective effect was also shown by the<br>
production of 6-keto-PGF1a and the restoration of the coronary vascular reactivity to<br>
Angiotensin II (Rossoni G., de Gennaro Colonna V., et al. (1998) Protectant activity 15<br>

independent cardioprotective effects of hexarelin in the rat. Endocrinology,<br>
140:4024-4031). Studies in hypophysectomised rats showed the GHS<br>
cardioprotective effects independents of GH and mediated by specific myocardial<br>
receptors (Locatelli V., Rossoni G., et. al. (1999) Growth hormone-independent<br>
cardioprotective effects of hexarelin in the rat. Endocrinology, 140:4024-4031; Bodart 25<br>
V., McNicoll N., et al. (1999) Identification and characterization of a new GHRP<br>
receptor in the heart. Circ Res, 85:796-808).<br>
Hexarelin increases the systolic ejection volume and cardiac output, and reduces the<br>
total peripheral resistance in a 4 week rat model after the myocardial infarction<br>
induction. Although the mechanism of the synthetic GHS inotropic activity is not 30<br>
clear, there are evidence of the increase in the papillary muscle contractility by action<br>
on the endothelial cells or in the nerve endings (Tivesten A., Bollano et al. (2000)<br>
.The growth hormone secretagogue Hexarelin improve cardiac function in rats after<br>
experimental myocardial infarction. Endocrinology, 141:60-66; Bedendi I., Gallo<br>
16<br>
M.P., et al. (2001) Role of endothelial cells in modulation of contractility induced by<br>
hexarelin in rat ventricle. Life Sci, 69:2189-2201)<br>
Ghrelin does not share all the cardiovascular actions of the synthetic GHS, ghrelin<br>
gives a poor protection to the heart suggesting that the synthetic GHS effects are<br>
due to the binding and activation of GHS specific sites studies with [125I]Tyr-Ala- 5<br>
hexarelin revealed many binding sites in rat myocardium and in human<br>
cardiovascular tissues distinct of GHSR-1a, suggesting the existence of another<br>
receptor, with a similar sequence to CD36 mediating the coronary actions of<br>
synthetic GHS (Torsello A., Bresciani E., et al. (2003) Ghrelin plays a minor role in<br>
the physiological control of cardiac function in the rat. Endocrinology, 144:1787– 10<br>
1792; Muccioli G., Broglio F., et al. (2000) Growth hormone-releasing peptides and<br>
the cardiovascular system. Ann Endocrinol (Paris) 61:27–31; Bodart V., Febbraio M.,<br>
et al. (2002) CD36 mediates the cardiovascular action of growth hormone-releasing<br>
peptides in the heart. Circ Res, 90:844–849). Although ghrelin is mostly inactive at a<br>
coronary level, it does present other cardiovascular effects, Ghrelin has a very potent 15<br>
in vivo and in vitro vasodilating effect, such ghrelin action is directed towards the non<br>
striated muscles with potency comparable to the natriuretic peptides. In human<br>
atherosclerosis patients ghrelin receptors are augmented suggesting that it plays a<br>
role on the compensation for the vasoconstriction increment observed in such<br>
condition. (Okumura H., Nagaya N., et al. (2002) Vasodilatory effect of ghrelin, an 20<br>
endogenous peptide from the stomach. J Cardiovasc Pharmacol, 39:779-783; Wiley<br>

artery: ghrelin is a potent physiological antagonist of endothelin-1. Br. J. Pharmacol,<br>

for localising GHS orphan receptors in human and rat tissue: up-regulation of 25<br>
receptors with atherosclerosis. Br J Pharmacol, 134:143-149).<br>
Other studies showed that hexarelin, acylated ghrelin and even ghrelin can prevent<br>
doxorubicin induced cell death of H9c2 cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells,<br>
probably stimulating intracellular signalling like the activation of<br>
ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase/AKT (Baldanzi G., Filigheddu N., et. al. (2002) Ghrelin and 30<br>
des-acyl ghrelin inhibit cell death in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells through<br>
ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase/AKT. J Cell Biol, 159:1029-1037; Filigheddu N., Fubini A., et<br>
al. (2001) Hexarelin protects H9c2 cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced cell<br>
death. Endocrine, 14:113–119).<br>
17<br>
In vivo studies on cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells suggests that the<br>
antiapoptotic effects of GHS are mediated by the activation of ERK and AKT and by<br>
the inhibition of the activation of caspase 3 and BAX expression increasing the<br>
expression of BCL-2 (Pang J.J., Xu R.K., et al. (2004) Hexarelin protects rat<br>
cardiomyocytes from angiotensin II-induced apoptosis in vitro. Am J Physiol Heart 5<br>
Circ Physiol, 286:H1063-H1069). Such data enforces the hypothesis of the existence<br>
of another GHS-R subtype, because non acylated ghrelin does not activate GHSR1a.<br>
Ghrelin and GHS have indeed cardiovascular activity in humans, its administration to<br>
healthy volunteers and patients with chronic cardiac failure reduced the systemic 10<br>
vascular resistance and increase the cardiac output and the systolic ejection volume,<br>
with a reduction of the mean arterial pressure but not showing any change in the<br>
heart rate, pressure on the medial pulmonary artery or capillary pulmonary pressure.<br>
(Nagaya N., Kojima M., et al. (2001) Hemodynamic and hormonal effects of human<br>
ghrelin in healthy volunteers. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol, 280:R1483– 15<br>
R1487; Enomoto M., Nagaya N., et al. (2003) Cardiovascular and hormonal effects<br>
of subcutaneous administration of ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing<br>
peptide, in healthy humans. Clin Sci (Lond), 105:431–435)<br>
It has also been observed that several trophic factors, including GH and IGF-I have<br>
neuroprotecting properties during the second phase of in vivo hypoxic ischemia (HI) 20<br>
and has been shown that the activation of the PI3K pathway with AKT<br>
phosphorylation is the mediator of the neuronal survival rate in vitro induced by<br>
growth factors, phosphorylated AKT promoted cell survival and can inhibit apoptosis<br>
by inactivation of several antiapoptotic targets like Bad, glycogen synthase 3 beta<br>
(GSK3ß), caspase 9 or transcriptional factor modification. (Kulik G., Klippel A., 25<br>
Weber M.J. (1997). Antiapoptotic signalling by the insulin-like growth factor I<br>
receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt. Mol Cell Biol, 17:1595-1606)<br>
Another pathway activated by growth factors is MAPK p42/44 ERK. ERK activation<br>
has been found to inhibit the hypoxia induced apoptosis, besides the neuroprotection<br>
BDNF in neonatal rats has shown to be mediated by the activation of MAPK/ERK 30<br>
and treatment IGF-I after HI activates Akt and EKR (Buckley S., Driscoll B., et al.<br>
(1999) ERK activation protects against DNA damage and apoptosis in hyperoxic rat<br>
AEC2. Am J Physiol, 277:159-166; Han B.H., Holtzman D.M. (2000) BDNF protects<br>
18<br>
the neonatal brain from hypoxic-ischemic injury in vivo via the ERK pathway. J<br>
Neurosci, 20:5775-5781)<br>
Hexarelin reduces the brain damage on an in vivo model of HI. This protection is<br>
related to AKT and GSK3ß phosphorylation indicating the possibility of the<br>
involvement of PI3K pathway, observing its protective effect to cortex, hippocampus 5<br>
thalamus, but not in the striatum, spatial distribution of the protection is correlated to<br>
the localization of GH receptor and hexarelin (Brywe K.G., Leverin A.-L., et al. (2005)<br>
Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide Hexarelin reduces neonatal brain injury and<br>
alters Akt/Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3ß phosphorylation. Endocrinology, 146: 4665-<br>
4672; Lobie P.E., García-Aragón J., et al. (1993) Localization and ontogeny of 10<br>
growth hormone receptor gene expression in the central nervous system. Dev Brain<br>
Res, 74:225-233; Scheepens A., Sirimanne E.S., et al. (2001) Growth hormone as a<br>
neuronal rescue factor during recovery from CNS injury. Neuroscience, 104:677-<br>
687). Such findings suggest that the hexarelin protective effect could be GH<br>
mediated or GH and hexarelin share common pathways for the cell protection 15<br>
because GHS-R mRNA has been found in several of the brain structures.<br>
Administration of GHRP-6 to adult rats under physiological conditions showed an<br>
increase on the levels of IGF-I in hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus but not in<br>
cortex, although this could be to the increase of the IGF-I expression, the same<br>
effect has not been found in hexarelin treated rats 24 hours after HI, on the other 20<br>
hand if IGF-I was an important mediator of hexarelin effects it could be also expected<br>
a reduction of the brain damage in the striatum, as IGF-I receptors are present there.<br>
(Frago L.M., Paneda C., Dickson S.L., et al. (2002) Growth hormone (GH) and GHreleasing<br>
peptide-6 increase brain insulin-like growth factor-I expression and activate<br>
intracellular signalling pathways involved in neuroprotection. Endocrinology, 25<br>
143:4113-4122; Guan J., Williams C., et al. (1993) The effects of IGF-1 treatment<br>
after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adult rats. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab, 13:609-<br>
616). Hexarelin also activates PI3K pathway in the Central Nervous System (CNS)<br>
after HI but it does not affects ERK phosphorylation, IGF-I in contrast activates both<br>
ERK and PI3K pathways. 30<br>
Hexarelin increase the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor in the absence of an<br>
obvious induction of IGF-I, the phosphorylation increase could be due to a receptor<br>
transactivation by hexarelin or an endogenous ligand. Previously has been reported<br>
that GPCR agonists like angiotensin-II, thrombin and endothelin can stimulate the<br>
19<br>
IGF-I and/or AKT (Sumitomo M., Milowsky M.I., et al. (2001) Neutral endopeptidase<br>
inhibits neuropeptide-mediated transactivation of the insulin-like growth factor<br>
receptor-Akt cell survival pathway. Cancer Res, 61:3294-3298; Zahradka P., Litchie<br>
B., et al. (2004) Transactivation of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor by<br>
angiotensin II mediates downstream signalling from the angiotensin II type 1 receptor 5<br>
to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Endocrinology, 145:2978-2987).<br>
The neuroprotective effect of hexarelin does not seem to be mediated primarily by an<br>
induction of the GH/IGF-I axis, though a increased signalling on the IGF-I receptor<br>
could contribute to the reduction of the brain damage.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In spite of the vast work on this field, described in the state of the art, it is evident<br>
however that all ghrelin mimetic compounds and those of non peptidic nature are not<br>
capable of exerting all possible functions attributed to ghrelin in the organism, being<br>
preferred the usage of compounds of peptidic nature, having a larger structural 15<br>
similarity, the description of such peptidic analogs is constrained however to the use<br>
of non natural D stereochemistry amino acids as part of the compositions.<br>
Taking into account the importance of the peptidic secretagogues in the previously<br>
described functions and the capacity of such compounds on the endocrine and non<br>
endocrine functions in a large variety of organisms, systems and cells, the present 20<br>
invention describe, in effect for the first time chemical molecules of a peptidic nature,<br>
with internal cycles and composed solely of amino acids with an L stereochemistry<br>
for the chiral carbon, capable of exerting due to their chemical structure, similar<br>
functions of those attributed to ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin and other peptidic GHS,<br>
including but not restricted to the GH releasing capacity, cardioprotection and in 25<br>
general functional improving of the cardiac muscle and the reticuloendothelial<br>
system, neuroprotection that does not only includes the brain but all the nervous<br>
system cells, and the control and regulation of appetite including the regulation of fat<br>
and energy metabolism.<br>
The peptidic chemical compounds described in the invention have an structure 30<br>
allowing them to fulfil the requirements to bind the ghrelin specific receptors and at<br>
the same time the receptors described for the binding of other secretagogues<br>
performing all of the aforementioned functions<br>
20<br>
In a particular realization, the invention refers to chemical molecules having the<br>
following structure:<br>

Were Aa are L-amino acids selected from the set of [Cys, Gly, Ser, His, Ala, Leu,<br>

selected from the set of [Arg, Leu, Pro, Val, Thr, Glu, His, Gln, Asn, Asp, Trp, Tyr,<br>

natural or not without limit in number, X1 y X2 are L-amino acids, natural o not, with 10<br>

21<br>
The aforementioned molecules were described for the function by the exhaustive<br>
molecular modelling of the human ghrelin receptor using combined techniques of<br>
homology modelling, molecular dynamics and exhaustive conformational search<br>
techniques.<br>
Once the receptor was modelled binding models were built based in the modelling of 5<br>
ghrelin and other secretagogues, based upon the receptor-ligand interactions a<br>
virtual library was built with several thousand of structures having such<br>
characteristics to perform a conformational analysis, and a massive docking<br>
experiment was performed against the receptor model.<br>
Based on this analysis a series of compounds were selected representing several 10<br>
structural families that were chemically synthesized and tested with several in vivo<br>
and in vitro systems, after the biological assays the compounds were reoptimized<br>
and new libraries were generated and the structural analysis was repeated to seek<br>
for a larger action on the biological systems, having more specific structural<br>
regularities. 15<br>
The invention also includes any homolog variant of the aforementioned compounds.<br>
Being understood as “homolog variant” any molecule of chemical nature similar in<br>
70% or more of the amino acid sequence to those described in this invention (page<br>
21), including non-natural amino acids, with a structure allowing it to perform the<br>
same effect of the hereby described compounds. 20<br>
In another preferred realization of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
contains one or more of the described compounds or its allowed salts, along with<br>
acceptable additive or vehicles for the application purpose. Also it is part of the<br>
present invention, the use of the compounds for the manufacturing of medicines,<br>
nutritional supplements, or other formulations of human or animal use in aquaculture 25<br>
or other breeding or animal improvement activities, in vivo, in vitro, in body<br>
associated devices or in devices for controlled release to the medium, associated to<br>
the action similar to other GHS, directly related or not to their endocrine action.<br>
The molecules described herein were defined by the capacity of interacting to the<br>
human ghrelin receptor, but we can not rule out another proteins not having similar 30<br>
structure or amino acid sequence but have the capacity to bind this type of<br>
compound and affect in any way their biological action being by activation,<br>
potentiation, repression, competition or synergism with other substrates, or by any<br>
mechanism, described or not but experimentally documented.<br>
22<br>
For the definition of the chemical compounds described in the invention, the<br>
molecular modelling of the human ghrelin receptor was performed, using combined<br>
techniques of homology modelling, molecular dynamics and exhaustive<br>
conformational search techniques. Once the receptor was modelled binding models<br>
were built based in the modelling of ghrelin and other secretagogues, based upon 5<br>
the receptor-ligand interactions a virtual library was built with several thousand of<br>
structures having such characteristics to perform a conformational analysis, and a<br>
massive docking experiment was performed against the receptor model.<br>
Based on this analysis a series of compounds were selected representing several<br>
structural families that were chemically synthesized and tested with several in vivo 10<br>
and in vitro systems, after the biological assays the compounds were reoptimized<br>
and new libraries were generated and the structural analysis was repeated with<br>
another round of molecular docking with the receptor to extract structural regularities,<br>
the chemical nature of the second round was optimized to reach higher values of<br>
calculated binding energy, ranging between -58 and -32 KJ/mol and analyzed again 15<br>
to look for a larger action on the biological systems, having more specific structural<br>
regularities. A representative selection of 18 such compounds with binding energies<br>
better than -40 KJ/mol, were synthesized, purified using High Performance Liquid<br>
Chromatography, analyzed by Mass Spectrometry and evaluated for the in vivo and<br>
in vitro effectiveness. 20<br>

Example 2: Prevention of NGF deprivation induced death on PC12 cells.<br>
PC12 cells were stored in 75 cm2 culture flasks on DMEM containing 5% bovine<br>
foetal serum and 10% horse serum, with 50 µg/ml gentamicin. Cells were incubated<br>
at 37°C in 5% CO2 .To induce differentiation cells were transferred at a density of<br>
1X104 to polylysine covered 96 well plates in NGF supplemented DMEM media for 7 15<br>
days, with medium replacement every 2-3 days. After differentiation cells were<br>
incubated with peptidic GHS analog compounds, at different concentrations for 72 h.<br>
Cell survival and proliferation was determined using the Promega non-radioactive<br>
cytotoxicity proliferation assay, Cell Titer 96, based in the conversion of<br>
3-(4,5-dimethyltiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in to a 20<br>

rats. After a rapid dissection, rat cerebellums were submerged in a cold solution and<br>
meningeal membranes were removed, each organ was transferred to a 2-3 ml fresh<br>
medium solution and finely sliced. Cells were dissociated using a Pasteur pipette<br>
and filtered through a nylon 40 mu.M membrane (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The<br>

GHS analog compounds. 5<br>
The compounds were dissolved in a sodium phosphate (PBS) buffer solution and<br>
injected twice a week, during three weeks at 0.1 µg/g of humid fish weight<br>
(gbw).Compounds were applied individually to a group of 10 male tilapias with an<br>
average weight of 60.41 ± 10.36 g and a control group with an average weight of<br>
60.58 ± 19.67 g was receiving PBS only as a control, measuring the average weight 10<br>
every week, all animals in the experiment were labelled with microchips (Stoelting<br>
Co. Wood Dale, USA.). for proper identification. A weight increase was obtained in<br>
the treated group with 165% peak relative to the control group as shown in table 5.<br>

Example 6: Growing of shrimps v Litopenaeus vanamei by dipping in a<br>
solution of the peptidic GHS analogs.<br>
Shrimp larvae were subjected two four dips, for one hour every three days with<br>
different peptidic GHS analogs at 0.1g/L. The control group was subjected to the<br>
same frequency of dipping with 1 mg/L BSA. 5<br>
As a result it was observed that in the treated group the quality of the larvae was<br>
improved with a 120-150% weight gain and 10-25% of size increase as shown in<br>
table 9, showing also a larger number of gill ramifications and rostral modifications.<br>
Besides it was found that n general in the treated group the animals had a lower<br>
muscular water content and better values of RNA/DNA, Protein/DNA, showing the 10<br>
higher activation of the metabolism in the treated larvae.<br>

This experiment was also performed in production conditions for compounds A221,<br>
A228 y A233, with a 20% of higher survival compared with the controls, keeping a<br>
stimulation of 110% on the weight and 30% in the size, showing on the treated<br>
animals a better homogeneity on the size distribution with only a 30% and a 8% of<br>
variation coefficient in weight and size respectively, on contras with a 77% and 30% 20<br>
in the non treated group.<br>

Example 7: Growth stimulation in shrimps by the dietary supplementation with<br>
the peptidic GHS analogs.<br>
The peptidic GHS analogs were included at 1% in a post-larvae crustacean diet.<br>
Post-larvae of Litopenaeus vanamei were fed with the aforementioned diet in parallel<br>
with a control group with 1% BSA addition. The effect was measured with an optical 5<br>
micrometer and weighing the animals in a 0.1 mg precision scale.<br>
The added compound produced a size increase of 30-40 % compared with the<br>
control group as shown in table 10.<br>

7.1: Artemia salina encapsulation<br>
The peptidic GHS analogs were bioencapsulated in Artemia to be fed to<br>
Litopenaeus vanamei post-larvae. For the encapsulation the compounds were added 15<br>
in a 10mh/L left for an hour, harvested and washed. The animals were fed four times<br>
a day for one month while the control group was fed with BSA encapsulated Artemia<br>
The effect was measured with an optical micrometer and weighing the animals in a<br>
0.1 mg precision scale. The encapsulated compounds increased the growth of the<br>
animals in a 30 to 40% respect to the control group with a highly significant 20<br>

Example 8: Cardioprotective effect in rats of the peptidic GHS analogs.<br>
To reproduce the physiopathogenic effects of a Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)<br>
female Wistar rats of 160 g were treated with 2mg/kg Doxorubicin (Dx) during 8<br>
weeks. A group of this rats was also treated in parallel with compounds A221, A228<br>
or A233 intraperitoneally at 500µg/Kg during the 8 weeks of Dx treatment, another 10<br>
Dx treated group was also receiving saline solution as a placebo, and as a healthy<br>
control for the experiment another group of untreated Wistar rats of the same age<br>
was used. After the 8 week treatment all the rats were tested with an<br>
echocardiogram, to test the ventricular functionality and assess the ventricular<br>
ejection fraction (VEF). As seen in fig.1 rats receiving the parallel Dx-compound 15<br>
A221(1a), A228(1b) or A233(1c) slightly modified VEF (p&gt;0.05) with respect to the<br>
healthy control, in contrast the group receiving placebo suffers a drop in VEF of<br>
about a 40% (p
functional implications for the stress response of the drop in VEF, the rats were<br>
subjected to forced swimming in 4°C water foe 30 minutes, as shown in fig. 2 20<br>
animals receiving the treatment with Dx-compound A221(2a), A228(2b) or A233(2c)<br>
have a survival of 100% and the Dx-saline solution survived to the 45 % (p=0.0043).<br>
32<br>
This results suggested that the protection by compounds A221, A228 ad A233, does<br>
not only maintains the VEF but also yields the heart resistant to forced stress.<br>
Example 9: Cardioprotective effect and reversion of the Dilated<br>
Cardiomyopathy (DCM) in rats of the peptidic GHS analogs.<br>
To assess if there is any dose-response effect and reversion of DCM, Wistar rats 5<br>
were subjected to a treatment with 2mg/kg of Doxorubicin (Dx) for 8 weeks, after the<br>
treatment all rats with a VEF drop higher than 40% were selected, divided in groups<br>
of n=8 and treated with different doses of compounds A221, A228 or A233 as<br>
follows:<br>
• 500 µg/kg, 10<br>
• 250 µg/kg,<br>
• 100 µg/kg,<br>
• 50 µg/kg,<br>
• 25 µg/kg,<br>
• 10 µg/kg 15<br>
• Saline Solution.<br>
Defining the groups based in the A221 doses.<br>
As shown in fig 3, two weeks after the treatment with compounds A221(3a),<br>
A228(3b) or A233(3c) partially reverts DCM in the concentration range of 50 µg/kg to<br>
500 µg/kg but at 4 weeks of treatment the DCM reversion is complete in the groups 20<br>
receiving the compounds A221, A228 or A233 in the 100 to 500 µg/kg range, 50<br>
µg/kg dosage is not effective for the total VEF recovery but somehow effective to<br>
reduce mortality in the group, respect to the animals receiving placebo or groups<br>
treated with lower concentrations, that do not recovered VEF and have a lower<br>
survival days after the treatment is finished. (Fig. 4, a A221, b A228 and c A233). 25<br>
