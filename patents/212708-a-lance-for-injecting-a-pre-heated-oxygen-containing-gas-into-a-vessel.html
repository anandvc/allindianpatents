				<td>A LANCE FOR INJECTING A PRE-HEATED OXYGEN-CONTAINING GAS INTO A VESSEL<br>
The present invention provides a lance for injecting a pre-heated oxygen-containing gas into a vessel.<br>
The invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to a lance for injecting a flow of preheated gas into a metallurgical vessel under high temperature conditions.<br>
The metallurgical vessel may for example be a direct smelting vessel in which molten metal is produced by a direct smelting process.<br>
The present invention also provides a direct smelting apparatus which includes a lance for injecting gas into a direct smelting vessel.<br>
In general, molten bath-based processes for direct smelting ferrous material into molten iron that are described in the prior art require post-combustion of reaction products such as CO and H2 released from a molten bath in order to generate sufficient heat to maintain the temperature of the molten bath.<br>
The prior art generally proposes that post<br>
combustion be achieved by injecting oxygen-containing gas via lances that extend into a top space of a direct smelting vessel.<br>
For economic reasons, it is desirable that direct smelting campaigns be relatively long, typically at least one year, and therefore it is important that gas injection lances be capable of withstanding the high temperature environment, typically of the order of 2000°C, within the top space of a direct smelting vessel for the prolonged periods of campaigns.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
One option for providing oxygen-containing gas is to use air or oxygen-enriched air that is preheated to above 800°C.<br>
Stoves or pebble heaters are the only currently viable options for pre-heating air or oxygen-enriched air. One consequence of the use of stoves and pebble heaters is that the air or oxygen-enriched air will pick up hard particulate material as it passes through the stoves and pebble heaters and this material can cause considerable wear to the internal surface of a lance.<br>
The use of air or oxygen-enriched air also means that considerably larger volumes of gas are required to achieve a given level of post combustion than would be required if oxygen was used as the oxygen-containing gas. Consequently, a direct smelting vessel operating with air or oxygen-enriched air must be a considerably larger structure than a direct smelting vessel operating with oxygen.<br>
Consequently, a lance for injecting air or<br>
oxygen-enriched air into a direct smelting vessel must be a relatively large structure that can extend a relatively substantial distance into a direct smelting vessel and be unsupported over at least a major part of the length of the lance.  By way of context, 6 meter diameter HIsmelt vessels proposed by the applicant include lances having an outer diameter of 1.2m that are of the order of 60 tonnes and extend approximately 10m into the vessel.<br>
In addition, such a lance must be capable of delivering relatively large volume flow rates of preheated air or oxygen-enriched air and withstanding wear of the interior of the lance due to erosive particulate material in the air or oxygen-enriched air over prolonged<br><br>
- 3 -smelting campaigns.<br>
For economic and structural reasons, carbon steel is the preferred material for constructing a lance for injecting pre-heated air or oxygen-enriched air.<br>
However, carbon steel is not a preferred material in terms of resisting wear of the interior of the lance and particularly in light of the risk of rapid oxidation (ie ignition) of steel under hot injection conditions.<br>
It is evident from the above that the use of preheated air or oxygen-enriched air presents significant issues in terms of the construction of lances for injecting the air or oxygen-enriched air into direct smelting vessels over prolonged smelting campaigns.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a water cooled lance that may be constructed using carbon steel as a major structural component of the lance and is capable of injecting pre-heated air or oxygen-enriched air into a direct smelting vessel during a lengthy operating campaign.<br>

The following description is in the context of smelting iron ore to produce molten iron and it is understood that the present invention is not limited to this application and is applicable to any suitable ferrous ores and/or concentrates - including partially reduced ferrous ores and waste revert materials.<br>
The direct smelting apparatus shown in Figure 1 includes a metallurgical vessel denoted generally as 11. The vessel 11 has a hearth that incudes a base 12 and sides 13 formed from refractory bricks; side walls 14 which form a generally cylindrical barrel extending upwardly from the sides 13 of the hearth and which includes an upper barrel section 151 formed from water cooled panels and a lower barrel section 153 formed from water cooled panels having an inner lining of refractory bricks; a roof 17; an outlet 18 for off-gases; a forehearth 19 for discharging molten metal continuously; and a tap-hole 21 for discharging molten slag.<br>
In use, the vessel contains a molten bath of iror and slag which, under quiescent conditions, includes a layer 22 of molten metal and a layer 23 of molten slag on the metal layer 22.  The term "metal layer" is understood herein to mean a region of the bath that is predominantly metal.  The term "slag layer" is understood herein to mean a region of the bath that is predominantly slag.  The arrow marked by the numeral 24 indicates the position of the nominal quiescent surface of the metal layer 22 and the arrow marked by the numeral 25 indicates the position of the nominal quiescent surface of the slag layer 23 (ie of the molten bath).  The term "quiescent surface" is understood to mean the surface when there is no injection of gas and solids into the vessel.<br>
The vessel is fitted with a downwardly extending hot air injection lance 26 for delivering a hot air blast<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
at a temperature in the range of 800-1400°C into an upper region of the vessel and post-combusting reaction gases released from the molten bath.  The lance 26 has an outer diameter D at a lower end of the lance.  The lance 26 is located so that:<br>
(i)    a central axis of the lance 26 is at an angle of 20 to 90° relative to a horizontal axis so that the angle of injection of hot air is within this range;<br>
(ii)   the lance 26 extends into the vessel a distance that is at least the outer diameter D of the lower end of the lance; and<br>
(iii)   the lower end of the lance 26 is at least 3 times the outer diameter D of the lower-end of the lance above the quiescent surface 25 of the molten bath.<br>
The vessel is also fitted with solids injection lances 27 (two shown) extending downwardly and inwardly-through the side walls 14 and into the molten bath for injecting iron ore, solid carbonaceous material, and fluxes entrained in an oxygen-deficient carrier gas into the molten bath.  The position of the lances 27 is selected so that their outlet ends 82 are above the quiescent surface of the metal layer 22.  This position of the lances reduces the risk of damage through contact with molten metal and also makes it possible to cool the lances by forced internal water cooling without significant risk of water coming into contact with the molten metal in the vessel.<br>
By way of context, a commercial vessel being<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
constructed by the applicant's related company/has a hearth diameter of 6m and a hot air lance 2 6 that weighs approximately 60 tonnes with an outer diameter of 1.2m and will extend approximately 10m into the vessel.<br>
The construction of one embodiment the hot air injection lance 26 is illustrated in Figures 2-10.<br>
As shown in these figures lance 26 comprises an elongate duct 31 which receives hot gas through a gas inlet structure 3 2 and injects it into the upper region of vessel.  The lance includes an elongate central tubular structure 33 which extends within the gas flow duct 31 from its rear end to its forward end.  Adjacent the forward end of the duct, central structure 33 carries a series of four swirl imparting vanes 34 for imparting swirl to the gas flow exiting the duct.  The forward end of central structure 33 has a domed nose 35 which projects forwardly beyond the tip 3 6 of duct 31 so that the forward end of the central body and the duct tip 36 co-act together to form an annular nozzle for divergent flow of gas from the duct with swirl imparted by the vanes 34. Vanes 34 are disposed in a four-start helical formation and are a sliding fit within the forward end of the duct.<br>
The wall of the main part of duct 31 extending downstream from the gas inlet 32 is internally water cooled.  This section of the duct is comprised of a series of three concentric steel tubes 37, 38, 39 extending to the forward end part of the duct where they are connected to the duct tip 36.   The duct tip 36 is of hollow annular formation and it is internally water cooled by cooling water supplied and returned through passages in the wall of duct 31.  Specifically, cooling water is supplied through an inlet 41 and annular inlet manifold 42 into an inner annular water flow passage 43 defined between the tubes 38, 39 of the duct through to the hollow interior of<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
the duct tip 36 through circumferentially spaced openings in the tip.  Water is returned from the tip through circumferentially spaced openings into an outer annular water return flow passage 44 defined between the tubes 37, 3 8 and backwardly to a water outlet 45 at the rear end of the water cooled section of duct 31.<br>
The outer surface of the outermost metal tube 37 of duct 31 is machined with a regular pattern of rectangular projecting lands in the form of bosses 136 each having an undercut or dove tail cross-section so that the bosses are of outwardly diverging formation and serve as keying formations for solidification of slag on the outer surfaces of the lance 26.  Solidification of slag on to the lance assists in minimising the temperatures of the metal components of the lance.<br>
The water cooled section of duct 31 is internally lined with an internal refractory lining 46 that fits within the innermost metal tube 3 9 of the duct and extends through to the water cooled tip 3 6 of the duct.  The inner periphery of duct tip 36 is generally flush with the inner surface of the refractory lining which defines the effective flow passage for gas through the duct.  The forward end of the refractory lining has a slightly reduced diameter section 47 which receives the swirl vanes 34 with a snug sliding fit.  Rearwardly from section 47 the refractory lining is of slightly greater diameter to enable the central structure 3 3 to be inserted downwardly through the duct on assembly of the lance until the swirl vanes 34 reach the forward end of the duct where they are guided into snug engagement with refractory section 47 by a tapered refractory land 48 which locates and guides the vanes into the refractory section 47.<br>
The front end of central structure 33 which carries the swirl vanes 34 is internally water cooled by<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
cooling water supplied forwardly through the central structure from the rear end to the forward end of the lance and then returned back along the central structure to the rear end of the lance.  This enables a very strong flow of cooling water directly to the forward end of the central structure and to the domed nose 3 5 in particular which is subjected to very high heat flux in operation of the lance.<br>
Central structure 3 3 comprises inner and outer concentric steel tubes 50, 51 formed by tube segments, disposed end to end and welded together.  Inner tube 50 defines a central water flow passage 52 through which water flows forwardly through the central structure from a water inlet 53 at the rear end of the lance through to the front end nose 35 of the central structure and an annular water return passage 54 defined between the two tubes through which the cooling water returns from nose 3 5 back through the central structure to a water outlet 55 at the rear end of the lance.<br>
The nose end 35 of central structure 33 comprises an inner copper body 61 fitted within an outer domed nose shell 62 also formed of copper.  The inner copper piece 61 is formed with a central water flow passage 63 to receive water from the central passage 52 of structure 3 3 and direct it to the tip of the nose.  Nose end 35 is formed with projecting ribs 64 which fit snugly within the nose shell 62 to define a single continuous cooling water flow passage 65 between the inner section 61 and the outer nose shell 62.  As seen particularly in Figures 5 and 6 the ribs 64 are shaped so that the single continuous passage 65 extends as annular passage segments 66 interconnected by passage segments 67 sloping from one annular segment to the next.  Thus passage 65 extends from the tip of the nose in a spiral which, although not of regular helical formation, does spiral around and back along the nose to<br><br>
18 -<br>
exit at the rear end of the nose into the annular return passage formed between the tubes 51, 52 of central structure 33.<br>
The forced flow of cooling water in a single coherent stream through spiral passage 65 extending around<br>
and back along the nose end 35 of central structure<br><br>
ensures efficient heat extraction and avoids the development of "hot spots" on the nose which could occur if the cooling water is allowed to divide into separate streams at the nose.  In the illustrated arrangement the cooling water is constrained in a single stream from the time that it enters the nose end 3 5 to the time that it exits the nose end.<br>
Inner structure 33 is provided with an external heat shield 69 to shield against heat transfer from the incoming hot gas flow in the duct 31 into the cooling water flowing within the central structure 33.  If subjected to the very high temperatures and high gas flows required in a large scale smelting installation, a solid refractory shield may provide only short service.  In the illustrated construction the shield 69 is formed of tubular sleeves of ceramic material marketed under the name UMCO.  These sleeves are arranged end to end to form a continuous ceramic shield surrounding an air gap 7 0 between the shield and the outermost tube 51 of the central structure.  In particular the shield may be made of tubular segments of UMCO 50 which contains by weight 0.05 to 0.12% carbon, 0.5 to 1% silicon, a maximum of 0.5% a maximum of 0.02% phosphorous, a maximum of 0.02% sulphur, 27 to 29% chromium, 48 to 52% cobalt and the balance essentially of iron.  This material provides excellent heat shielding but it undergoes significant thermal expansion at high temperatures.  To deal with this problem the individual tubular segments of the heat shield are formed and mounted as shown in Figures 7 - 10 to<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
enable them to expand longitudinally independently of one another while maintaining a substantially continuous shield at all times  As illustrated in those figures the individual sleeves are mounted on location strips 71 and plate supports 72 fitted to the outer tube 51 of central structure 33, the rear end of each shield tube being stepped at 73 to fit over the plate support with an end gap 74 to enable independent longitudinal thermal expansion of each strip.  Anti-rotation strips 75 may also be fitted to each sleeve to fit about raised spline strips 76 on tube 52 to prevent rotation of the shield sleeves.<br>
Hot gas is delivered to duct 31 through the gas inlet section 32.  The hot gas may be oxygen enriched air provided through heating stoves at a temperature of the order of 1200°C.  This air must be delivered through refractory lined ducting and it will pick up refractory grit which can cause severe erosion problems if delivered at high speed directly into the main water cooled section of duct 31.  Gas inlet 32 is designed to enable the duct to receive high volume hot air delivery with refractory particles while minimising damage of the water cooled section of the duct.  Inlet 31 comprises a T-shaped body 81 moulded as a unit in a hard wearing refractory material and located within a thin walled outer metal shell 82 Body 81 defines a first tubular passage 83 aligned with the central passage of duct 31 and a second tubular passage 84 normal to passage 83 to receive the hot airflow delivered from stoves (not shown).  Passage 83 is aligned with the gas flow passage of duct 31 and is connected to it through a central passage 85 in a refractory connecting piece 86 of inlet 32.<br>
The hot air delivered to inlet 32 passes through tubular passage 84 of body 81 and impinges on the hard wearing refractory wall of the thick refractory body 82 which is resistant to erosion.  The gas flow then changes<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
direction to flow at right angles down through passage 83 of the T-shaped body 81 and the central passage 85 of transition piece 86 and into the main part of the duct. The wall of passage 83 may be tapered in the forward flow direction so as to accelerate the flow into the duct.  It may for example be tapered to an included angle of the order of 7°.  The transition refractory body 86 is tapered in thickness to match the thick wall of refractory body 81 at one end and the much thinner refractory lining 46 of the main section of duct 31.  It is accordingly also water cooled through an annular cooling water jacket 87 through which cooling water is circulated through an inlet 88 and an outlet 89.  The rear end of central structure 33 extends through the tubular passage 83 of gas inlet 32. It is located within a refractory liner plug 91 which closes the rear end of passage 83, the rear end of central structure 33 extending back from gas inlet 32 to the water flow inlet 53 and outlet 55.<br>
The illustrated apparatus is capable of injecting high volumes of hot gas into the smelting vessel 11 at high temperature.  The central structure 33 is capable of delivering large volumes of cooling water quickly and directly to the nose section of the central structure and the forced flow of that cooling water in an undivided cooling flow around the nose structure enables very efficient heat extraction from the front end of the central structure   The independent water flow to the tip of the duct also enables efficient heat extraction from the other high heat flux components of the lance. Delivery of the hot air flow into an inlet in which it impacts with a thick wall of a refractory chamber or passage before flowing downwardly into the duct enables high volumes of air contaminated with refractory grit to be handled without severe erosion of the refractory lining and heat shield in the main section of the lance.<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
The construction of another, although not the only other, embodiment of the hot air injection lance 26 is illustrated in Figures 11-19.<br>
As shown in these figures, lance 26 comprises an elongate duct 31 through which to pass the flow of hot air, which may be oxygen enriched.  Duct 31 is comprised of a series of four concentric steel tubes 32, 33, 34, 35 extending to a forward end part 36 of the duct where they are connected to a tip end piece 37.  An elongate body part 38 is disposed centrally within the forward end part 36 of the duct and carries a series of four swirl imparting vanes 39-  Central body part 38 is of elongate cylindrical formation with bull-nosed or domed forward and rear ends 41, 42.  Vanes 39 are disposed in a four-start helical formation and are connected at their forward ends by radially outwardly extending vane ends 45 to the forward part of the duct.<br>
Duct 31 is internally lined throughout most of its length by an internal refractory lining 43 which fits within the innermost metal tube 35 of the duct and extends through to the forward end parts 42 of the vanes, the vanes 39 fitting neatly within the refractory lining behind these forward end parts 42.<br>
The tip end piece 37 of the duct has a hollow annular head or tip formation 44 which projects forwardly from the remainder of the duct so as to be generally flush with the inner surface of the refractory lining 43 which defines the effective flow passage for gas through the duct.  The forward end of central body part 38 projects forwardly beyond this tip formation 44 so that the forward end of the body part and the tip formation co-act together to form an annular nozzle from which the hot air blast emerges in an annular diverging flow with a strong rotational or swirling motion imparted by the vanes 39.<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
In accordance with the present invention, duct tip formation 44, central body part 38 and vanes 39 are all internally water cooled with flows of cooling water provided by cooling water flow passage means denoted generally as 51 extending through the wall of the duct. Water flow passage means 51 comprises a water supply passage 52 defined by the annular space between the duct tubes 33, 34 to supply cooling water to the hollow interior 53 of duct tip formation 44 via circumferentially spaced openings 54 in tip end piece 37.  Water is returned from the tip end piece through circumferentially spaced openings 55 into an annular water return flow passage 56 defined between the duct tubes 32 and 33 and also forming part of the water flow passage means 51.  The hollow interior 53 of tip end piece 37 is thus continuously supplied with cooling water to act as an internal cooling passage.  The cooling water for the lance tip is delivered into supply passage 52 through an water inlet 57 at the rear end of the lance and the returning water leaves the lance through an outlet 58 also at the rear end of the lance.<br>
The annular space 59 between duct tubes 34 and 3 5 is divided by helically wound divider bars into eight separated helical passages 60 extending from the rear end of the duct through to the forward end part 36 of the duct.  Four of these passages are supplied independently with water through four circumferentially spaced water inlets 62 to provide for independent water supplies for the cooling of vanes 39 and body part 38.  Water inlets 62 communicate with a common water supply tube 80 via an annular supply manifold 90.  The other four passages 60 serve as return flow passages which are connected to a common annular return manifold passage 63 and a single water outlet 64.<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
Vanes 39 are of hollow formation and the<br>
interiors are divided to form water inlet and outlet flow passages through which water flows to and from the central body part 38 which is also formed with water flow passages for internal water cooling.  The forward end parts 45 of vanes 39 are connected to the forward end of innermost duct tube 35 about four water inlet slots 65 through which water flows from the four separately supplied water inlet flow passages into radially inwardly directed inlet passages 66 in the forward ends of the vanes.  The cooling water then flows into the forward end of central body part 38.<br>
Central body part 38 is comprised of forward and rear inner body parts 68, 69 housed within a casing 70 formed of a main cylindrical section 71 and domed front and rear end pieces 41, 42 which are hard faced to resist abrasion by refractory grit or other particulate material carried by the hot gas flow.  A clearance space 74 between the inner parts 68, 69 and the outer casing of the central body part is sub-divided into two sets of peripheral water flow passages 75, 76 by means of divider ribs 77, 78 formed on the outer peripheral surfaces of the inner body parts 68, 69.  The forward set of peripheral water flow channels 75 are arranged to fan out from the front end of the central body part in the manner shown in Figure 17 and backwardly around the body.  A flow guide insert 81 is located centrally within the inner body part 68 to extend through the water flow passage 67 and to divide that passage into four circumferentially spaced water flow passages which independently receive the incoming flows of water through the water inlet passages 66 in the forward ends of the vanes, so maintaining four independent water inlet flows through to the front end of the central body part.  These separate water flows communicate with the four front peripheral water flow channels 75 through which water flows back around the forward end of the central<br><br>
- 24 -body part.<br>
A baffle plate 82 divides the water inlet<br>
passages 66, 67 in the forward ends of the vanes and the central body part from water flow passages in the rear parts of the vanes and the central body part.  The water flowing back through the forward peripheral channels 7 5 extends through slots 83 in this baffle located between the inlet passages 66 so as to flow back into a central passage 84 in the rear body part 69.  This passage is also divided into four separate flow channels by means of a central flow guide 85 to continue the four separate water flows through to the rear end of the central body.  The rear peripheral flow channels 76 are also arranged in a set of four in similar fashion to the by-passages 75 at the front end of the central body so as to receive the four separate water flows at the rear end of the body and to take them back around the periphery of the body back to four circumferentially spaced outlet slots 86 in the casing through which the water flows into return passage 87 in the vanes.<br>
The hollow vanes are divided internally by<br>
longitudinal baffles 89 so that the cooling water passages extend from the inner forward ends of the vanes back to the rear ends of the vanes then outwardly and forwardly along the outer longitudinal ends of the vanes to radially extending water outlet passages 91 in the forward ends 42 of the vanes which communicate through outlet slots 93 with the four circumferentially spaced return passages extending back through the duct wall to the common outlet 64 at the rear end of the duct.  Baffle 82 divides the inlet and outlet passages 66, 91 within the vanes and the water inlet and outlet flow slots 65, 93 for each vane are formed in the forward end of the inner duct tube 35 at an angle to the longitudinal direction to suit the helix angle of the vanes as seen in Figure 3.<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
The forward ends of the four concentric duct tubes 32, 33, 34, 35 are welded to three flanges 94, 95, 96 of the tip end piece 37 so that they are firmly connected into a strong structure at the forward end of the lance.  The rear ends of the duct tubes can move longitudinally with respect to one another to allow for differential thermal expansion during operation of the lance.  As most clearly seen in Figure 19, the rear end of duct tube 32 is provided with an outstanding flange 101 to which there is welded a continuous structure 102 which carries the various water inlets and outlets 57, 58, 80, 64.  Structure 102 includes an internal annular flange 103 fitted with an 0-ring seal 104 which serves as a sliding mounting for the rear end of duct tube 33, so allowing the duct tube 33 to expand and contract longitudinally independently of the outer duct tube 32.  A structure 105 welded to the rear end of duct tube 34 includes annular flanges 106, 107 fitted with 0-ring seals 108, 109 which provide a sliding mounting for the rear end of the duct tube 34 within the outer structure 102 fixed to the rear end of duct tube 32 so that duct tube 34 can also expand and contract independently of duct tube 32.  The rear end of the inner most duct tube 35 is provided with an outstanding flange 111 fitted with an O-ring seal 112 which engages an annular ring 113 fitted to the outer structure 102 so as to also provide a sliding mounting for the innermost duct tube allowing for independent longitudinal expansion and contraction.<br>
Provision is also made for thermal expansion of the flow guide vanes 39 and the inner body part 38.  The vanes 3 9 are connected to the duct and to the inner body part only at their forward ends and in particular at the locations where there are water inlet and outlet flows at the inner and outer parts of the forward ends of the vanes.  The main parts of the vanes simply fit between the<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
refractory lining 43 of the duct and the casing of central body part 3 8 and are free to expand longitudinally.  The water flow divider 85 within the rear section of the inner body part has a circular front end plate which slides within a machined surface of a tubular spigot 122 on baffle 82 so as to permit the forward and rear parts of the central body part to move apart under thermal expansion while maintaining sealing between the separated water flow passages.  A thermal expansion joint 133 is provided to accommodate the thermal expansion between the forward and front ends of the central body part.<br>
To further allow for thermal expansion, the vanes 39 may be shaped so as they do not extend radially outwardly between the casing of the Central body part and the refractory lining of the duct when viewed in cross-section but such that they are slightly offset at an angle to the truly radial direction when the lance tubes and central body are in a cold condition.  Subsequent expansion of the duct tubes during operation of the lance will allow the vanes to be drawn toward truly radial positions while maintaining proper contact with the duct lining and central body part while avoiding radial stresses on the vanes due to thermal expansion.<br>
In operation of the illustrated hot air injection lance, independent cooling water flows are delivered to the four swirl vanes 3 9 so there can be no loss of cooling efficiency due to differential flow effects.  The independent cooling water flows are also provided to the forward and rear ends of the central body part 3 8 so as to eliminate hot spots due to lack of water flow because of possible preferential flow effects.  This is particularly critical for cooling of the forward end 41 of the central body part which is exposed to extremely high temperature conditions within the smelting vessel.<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
The duct tubes can expand and contract<br>
independently in the longitudinal direction under thermal expansion and contraction effects and the vanes and central body parts are also able to expand and contract without impairing the structural integrity of the lance or maintenance of the various independent flows of cooling water.<br>
The illustrated lance is capable of operating under extreme temperature conditions within a direct smelting vessel in which molten iron is produced by the high smelt process.  Typically the cooling water flow rate through the four swirl vanes and the central body part will be of the order of 90m3/Hr and the flow rate through the outer housing and the lance tip will be of the order of 400m3/Hr. The total flow rate may therefore be of the order of 490m3/Hr at a maximum operating pressure of the order of 1500kPag.<br>
Although the illustrated lances have been designed for injection of a hot air blast into a direct smelting vessel, it will be appreciated that similar lances may be used for injecting gases into any vessel in which high temperature conditions prevail, for example for the injection of oxygen, air or fuel gases into furnace vessels.<br>
It is accordingly to be understood that the invention is in no way limited to the details of the illustrated construction and that many modifications and variations may be made to the invention as described.<br><br>

The duct includes (i) inner and outer concentric carbon steel tubes (37, 39) which provide major structural support for the duct, (ii) cooling water supply and return passage means (43, 44) extending through the duct wall from the rear end to the forward end of the duct for supply and return of cooling water to the forward end of the duct, and (iii) a mechanical means in the form of lands (136) on the exterior surface of the duct adapted to hold a layer of frozen slag on the duct. The lance also includes a gas inlet (32) for introducing hot gas into the rear end of the duct. The lance also includes a tip means (36) joined to the concentric tubes at the forward end of the duct. The lance also includes a protective lining formed from a refractory or other material that is capable of protecting the duct from exposure to gas flow at 800-1400 DEGC through the duct. The lining is a non-metallic material with heat insulating properties when compared to the steel tubes. The lance also includesiia swirl means (34) located in the duct for imparting swirl to gas flow through the forward end of the duct.<br><br><br></td>
