				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a hood assembly which covers an engine and other<br>
components of a vehicle, such as an agricultural or industrial vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is a known practice to provide a tractor with a hood which encloses the engine<br>
and other components of the tractor. But conventional hoods may have problems<br>
as a result of thermal expansion of various parts of the hood. Conventional<br>
hoods also can interface with visibility forward from a cab of the tractor.<br>
Conventional hoods typically have cosmetically finished panels which are<br>
relatively inflexible and are therefore subject to permanent damage when struck<br>
by an object, and which are directly exposed to heat from the vehicle engine.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle hood assembly with<br>
which the recited problems are overcome and the desires are met. In particular it<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle hood assembly which<br>
accommodates thermal expansion of its components. Another object is to<br>
provide such a hood assembly wherein interference with visibility forward from a<br>
cab of the tractor is minimized. A still another object is to provide such a hood<br><br>
assembly wherein cosmetically finished panels are relatively flexible so as to be<br>
less likely to be permanently damaged when struck by an object. A further object<br>
is to provide such a hood assembly wherein finished panels are not directly<br>
exposed to heat from the vehicle engine.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
These and other objects including the further advantageous arrangements and<br>
developments are achieved by the described features of the invention.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention a vehicle hood<br>
assembly includes an inner hood support having a top section joined top left and<br>
right side sections and to a front section. An outer panel assembly includes a<br>
finished top panel mounted on the top section, a finished front panel assembly<br>
mounted on the front section, a finished left panel mounted on the left section,<br>
and a finished right panel mounted on the right section. Each panel and its<br>
respective section form and enclose an air space therebetween. Thus, the inner<br>
support and the air space is interposed between the finished panels and the heat<br>
from the engine. The inner hood support comprises a heat shield interposed<br>
between the panels and the engine of the vehicle. As the hood is raised, the<br>
lower portions of the side panels engage a wear strip and are deflected laterally<br>
outwardly and way from each other. As the hood is lowered, the lower portions<br>
of the side panels move past the wear strip, and they move laterally inwardly<br>
and towards each other.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention and further advantageous developments and arrangements of the<br>
invention will now be described and explained in more detail by way of example<br>
and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>

assembly according to the invention,<br>

Figure 1,<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
As seen in Figures 1 and 2, an agricultural tractor 10 has an engine 12 which is<br>
located forward of the operator's cab 14 and a hood assembly 16 which is<br>
coupled to the tractor by a hinge 15. As best seen in Figure 2, the hood<br>
assembly 16 includes an inner hood support 18 having a top section 20 joined to<br>
left and right side sections 22, 24, and joined to a front section 26. The hood<br>
support 18 is preferably formed out of plastic material with a higher fiberglass<br>
content for higher rigidity. Top section 20 includes an intake opening 19<br>
positioned to align with an intake air filter (not shown) of the engine 12.<br>
Hood assembly 16 also includes a finished outer panel assembly 30 comprising a<br>
finished top panel 32 mounted on the top section 20, a finished front panel<br>
assembly 34, including a headlight assembly 36, grille 38 and trim piece 40,<br>
mounted on the front section 26, a finished left panel 42 mounted on the left<br>
section 22, and a finished right panel 44 mounted on the right section 24. When<br>
assembled, each panel 32, 42, 44 and its corresponding section 20, 22, 24,<br>
forms and encloses an air space therebetween. The inner support 18 serves as a<br>
heat shield. The inner support 18 and the air space shield the outer hood<br>
assembly 30 from heat from the engine. Top panel 32 includes a pair of engine<br>
air intake ports 46 and 48 formed therein. A plurality of engine air intake slots 50<br>
are formed in a forward end of top section 20. Normally, engine intake air will<br><br>
flow from ports 46, 48 to opening 19 via the air space formed between panel 32<br>
and section 20. This air space preferably is formed as an air duct. But, if the<br>
ports 46 and 48 are blocked, the engine 12 can still obtain intake air via intake<br>
port, preferably via slots 50. The panels 32, 42 and 44 are preferably formed out<br>
of plastic material with a lower or zero fiberglass content for lower weight and<br>
lower rigidity that the hood support 18.<br>
A plurality of mounting slots 52 are formed in the side sections 22, 24 (although<br>
only left side section 22 is visible in Figure 2). The slots 52 are preferably formed<br>
along a lower edge of side sections 22, 24. A plurality of mounting slots 54 are<br>
formed in the side edges of top panel 32 (although only left side of panel 32 is<br>
visible in Figure 2). Each side panel 42, 44 has an upper array of inwardly<br>
projecting mounting pegs 56 (although only the pegs of right side of panel 44<br>
are visible in Figure 2). When assembled, the mounting pegs 56 are received in<br>
the corresponding slots 54.<br>
Each side panel 42, 44 also has a lower array of inwardly projecting mounting<br>
pegs 58, (although only the pegs of right side of panel 44 are visible in Figure 2).<br>
When assembled, the mounting pegs 58 are received in the corresponding slots<br>
52 in the side sections 22 and 24. As one moves toward the rear of hood support<br>
18, the slots 52 have a progressively longer fore-and-aft dimension to<br>
accommodate expansion and contraction of the panels 42, 44 relative to the side<br>
sections 22, 24 of the hood support 18. As a result, the side panels 42, 44 are<br>
fixed with respect to the top panel 32, and panels 42, 44 and 32 form a unit<br>
which is movable with respect to the inner support 18.<br><br>
The hood 16 may be held in a raised position by a support rod 60, part of which<br>
is visible in Figure 1. A wear strip 62 is mounted over a rear portion of the<br>
engine 12. As best seen in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, the wear strip 62 has a<br>
generally inverted U-shape with downward extending legs 64 and 66. Preferably,<br>
the lower ends of the legs 64 and 66 are firmly attached to a part of the vehicle,<br>
such as a transmission housing. The upper ends of the legs 64 and 66 are<br>
farther apart from each other than are the lower ends of legs 64 and 66. As the<br>
hood 10 is raised, the lower portions of the side panels 42, 44 engage the wear<br>
strip 62 and are deflected laterally outwardly and away from each other.<br>
Conversely, as the hood 10 is lowered, as the lower portions of the side panels<br>
42, 44 move past the wear strip 62, they move laterally inwardly and towards<br>
each other. This inward movement increases the visibility past the hood 10 when<br>
the hood is lowered.<br>
While the present invention has been described in conjunction with a specific<br>
embodiment, it is understood that many alternatives, modifications and<br>
variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing<br>
description. Accordingly, this invention is intended to embrace all such<br>
alternatives, modifications and variations which fall within the spirit and scope of<br>
the claims.<br><br>
