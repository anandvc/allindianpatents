				<td>The  present   invention  relates   to  a process for the prpatation of 13 –(N-ß isobutyliso seinyl)-14ß hydrozy loccati he III .14 novel   taxane  useful<br>
as chemotherapeutic agent, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing it and a process for the preparation of 14-S-hydroxy-1,14-carbonate-baccatine III and V derivatives, substituted at the 13 position by an isoserine residue.<br>
Taxanes are one of the most important classes of anticancer drugs recently developed. The remarkable effectiveness of Paclitaxel and of its analogue Docetaxel in the treatment of several tumors has focused research on substances with antimicrotubular activity. Taxanes are however characterized by a particular action mechanism, in that they promote the assembly of microtubules and inhibit tubuline depolymerization.<br>
The main drawbacks of the taxanes presently used are: (a) insolubility in water, making mandatory the use of specific carriers which can cause hypersensitization reactions, (b) toxicities which limit dosages, (c) development of resistance mechanisms. Cell resistance to taxanes has been related to the MDR phenotype ("multidrug<br>
resistance") mediated by the P-glycoprotein transporter, by<br>
tubuline alterations, and by changes in the expression of<br>
apoptotic regulatory proteins.<br>
In order to find novel active molecules having, higher solubility and better tolerability, 14ß-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatine III and V taxane derivatives have been synthesized.<br>
Some derivatives of 14-hydroxy baccatine III substituted at the 13- position by isoserine residues are disclosed in US 5,705,508, together with a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
It has now been found that the compound of formula<br>
(I), a 14ß-hydroxy-l,l4-carbonate-baccatine V derivative,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
has remarkable cytotoxic and anticancer activities, and is capable of overcoming the resistance of cell lines expressing the MDR phenotype.<br>
Said compound differs from the derivatives described in the above mentioned American Patent due to the hydroxyl at the 7- position, which in the present case is in alfa configuration. 13- (N-Boc-S-Isobutylisoserinyl) -14ß-hydroxy-baccatine III 1,14-carbonate, corresponding to the derivative referred to in US 5,705,508 as SB-T-1011311, can be used as starting product for the preparation of compound (I) . In this case, said baccatine III derivative is either treated with DBU (diazabicyclo[5,4,0] 7-undecen0) in methanol or THF or it is simply left in solution with<br>
methylene chloride or chlorinated solvents in the presence of aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol with basic allumine for a time ranging from one hour to 14 days. The compound having beta configuration at C-7, is converted at neutral or slightly basic pH to the more stable alfa isomer (baccatine V derivative) .<br>
Alternatively, compound (I) can be prepared with a process which also allows to prepare the corresponding beta epimer at C-7.<br>
Said process (A) comprises the following steps:<br>
a)   transformation        of         14ß-hydroxy-10-<br>
deacetylbaccatine III or V into the derivative triethylsilylated at the 7- position;   . . -'<br>
b)	preparation of the 1,14 carbonate derivative from<br>
the product of step (a);<br>
c)	selective acetylation of the 10- hydroxyl;<br>
d)	reaction of the product of step (c) with: (4S,<br>
5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-<br>
oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid;<br>
e)	cleavage    of    the    triethylsilyl    and<br>
dimethoxybenzylidene protective groups from the<br>
product of step (d).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of process! (A) , triethylchlorosilane is used as silylating agent ini step (a), whereas the 1,14 carbonate derivative in step (Ib) is prepared using phosgene in toluene in a 3:1 methylene chloride/pyridine solution under nitrogen atmosphere. In the following step (c) 14-ß-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatine III or V 7-Tes-l,14-carbonate is salified with LiHMDS in anhydrous THF, thereby obtaining the 10-hydroxy derivative lithium salt, which is subsequently acetylated with acetyl chloride. The condensation reaction between 14-ß-hydroxy-7-Tes-l,14-carbonate-baccatine III or V and (4S, 5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid (step (d) ) is carried out in anhydrous apolar organic solvent, in the presence of a base and a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
Finally, in step (e) triethylsilyl is removed with pyridinium fluoride in acetonitrile/pyridine solution under nitrogen, whereas the dimethoxybenzylidene group is removed in methylene chloride solvent by addition of methanol HC1 and subsequently of NaHCO3 .<br>
The step sequence of the process described can be inverted thus obtaining the final product in as1 much comparable yields. Said alternative process (B) comprises<br>
the following steps :<br>
a)	selective acetylation of the hydroxyl at O10 at 14ß-hydroxy-10- acetyl<br>
baccatine III or V:<br>
b)	preparation of the 1, 14 carbonate derivative from the product of step (a )<br>
c)	silylation of the hydroxyl at C-7;<br>
d)	reaction of   the product of step   (c) with (4S , 5R) -N-Boc-2-(2, 4-d<br>
imethoxyphenyl) -4-isobutyl-l oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid;<br>
e)	cleavage of the triethylsilyl and dimethoxybenzylidene protective groups<br>
from the product of step (d) .<br>
The latter process involves a number of advantages such as the possibility to obtain the desired synton (1, 14-) carbonate-7-Tes-baccatine III or V) without chromatographic purifications, merely by crystallization.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the selective acetylation of step! (a ') is carried out with acetic anhydride in the presence of cerium, scandium, ytterbium salts, preferably CeCl3 .7H2O, whereas the remaining steps are carried out as indicated above.<br>

46.8 g of L-leucinol II (400 mmol) were dissolved in 300 ml of CH2Cl2 in a 21 three-necked round-bottom flask<br>
equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer and dropping funnel. The stirred solution was then added drop by drop at room temperature with the solution of Boc anhydride (87.2 g, 400 mmol) in CH2C12 (100 mL) in 90 minutes. During the addition of the first 25% of Boc-anhydride, the reaction was exothermic and it reached 20-30°C yielding a slurry which turned clear after stirring at room temperature for a further three hours. The whole was left at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated under high vacuum to obtain the desired product as a thick oil in a quantitative yield (87 g) . The product was subsequently treated without<br>
further purifications.<br>

A .solution of oxalyl chloride (26.274 mL, 300 mmol) in 130 ml of methylene chloride precooled' at -60/-65°C was slowly added with DMSO (28.4 mL, 400 mmol).<br>
The solution turned clear when the addition of DMSO was completed. After 20 minute stirring at the; same temperature the reaction mixture was subsequently treated with a solution of alcohol III (43.7 g, 200 mmol) in CH2C12 (200 mL) for 25 min. keeping temperature below -60°C. During the addition of the alcohol the reaction mixture<br>
became cloudy, and a white precipitate formed. After 20-25 minutes of stirring at the same temperature a solution of triethylamine (112 mL, 800 mmol) in CH2C12 (100 mL) was added dropwise in 40 minutes keeping temperature between -68 and -62 °C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at between -60 and -65°C for a further 50 minutes. TLC of the reaction mixture carried out using 8% methanol in CH2,C12 as eluent detected no starting product.<br>
The cold solution was then poured into 800 ml •. of an iced solution containing 68 g  (0.5 mol)  of KHS04. The organic layex was separated and the aqueous phase extracted with .CH2C12_ (100 mL).  The combined organic phases were washed with aqueous KHS04 (5%, 1x200 mL), brine (100 mL, 50 mL)  and concentrated  to  half  volume  (-250  mL) .  Said material was used directly in the subsequent step. Aldehyde (V) bisulfite compound derivative The methylene chloride solution of the aldehyde (IV) in a 21  three-necked round-bottom flask equipped! with mechanical stirrer,  thermometer and dropping funnel was treated in 10 minutes and at -5°C with a sodium solution bisulfite  (41.7  g,  400  mmol)  in water  (200  mL)  and subsequently with n-Bu4NHS04 (678 mg, 2 mmol) .

The solvent was evaporated by rotatory evaporator, 60 ml of water and 60 ml of ethyl acetate were added keeping the whole under stirring. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL) . The combined organic phases were extracted with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (30 mL, 20 mL) . The basic extract was then combined with an aqueous phase acidified with 2M hydrochloric acid (-55 mL) to adjust pH of the solution to 2. Acid VIII was then extracted from the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate (3x40 mL) and the heteroacetic extracts were washed with water (20 mL) , dried (MgS04) and evaporated to give the crude VIII Boc derivative as syrup (20 g, 99%).<br>

(26.16 g, 120 mmol) . The solution was stirred for 40 hours<br>
at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated by rotatory<br>
evaporator and water (100 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL)<br>
were added to the residue keeping stirring for a further<br>
few minutes. The organic phase was separated and extracted<br>
with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate  (45 mL,  30 mL) .  The<br>

(2R.3S)-3- (N-Boc) Amino-2-hydroxv-5-methvlhexanoic acid methyl ester (IX)<br>
Diazomethane was prepared from diazald following the process reported in T.H. Black [Aldrichimica Acta, 16, 3 (1983)] .<br>
(A)	A solution of the crude acid VIII  (20 g, 56.6<br>
mmol)  in CH2C12  (75  mL)  was  slowly added to a cold<br>
diazomethane ethereal solution (-77 mmol) and the mixture<br>
was left for two hours on ice bath. The colour' of the<br>
solution in that step turned white thus indicating that<br>
most diazomethane had been adsorbed. The solution was then<br>
concentrated and the residue crystallized from a mixture of<br>
toluene (20 mL) and hexane (70 mL) . After cooling overnight<br>
in refrigerator at 4°C, the crystals of the pure IXA 2R,3S<br>
derivative were collected by filtration. The yield was 15<br>
g. The mother liquors gave about 5 g of a 1:1 isomeric<br>
mixture.<br>

VIII (16 g) was transformed into a 1:1 mixture of IXA and<br>
IXB esters . The material from mother liquors (5 g from<br>
step A)  was added and the material  was  combined and<br>
separated  by  column  chromatography  using  hexane-ethyl<br>
acetate as eluent  (9:1 to 7:3). Ninhydrine was used as<br>
developer for the TLC plates. The apolar compound, Rf 0.75<br>
(hexanoethyl acetate : 7:3) was identified as the desired ester IXA (2R,3S), which was recrystallized from cyclohexane to give IXA as colorless needles (8 g) m.p. 95-96°C, [α]D 72,4° (c=l, MeOH).<br>
The polar compound, Rf 0.5 (hexane-ethyl acetate 7:3) was identified as IXB (2S,3S), and was recrystallized from<br>
cyclohexane  to give   10 g of  IXB as  colorless needles.<br>
2 , 4 -dimethoxvbenzaldehvdedimethvl   acetal<br>
A mixture of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (41.25 g, 0.25 mols), anhydrous trimethyl orthoformate (50 mL) and ammonium nitrate (2 g dissolved in 20 ml of methanol) was refluxed for 6 hours ( HNMR of the reaction mixture showed a 65-70% conversion) . At first, the hot reaction mixture was a clear solution, but as the reaction progressed the solid precipitated. A second portion of anhydrous trimethyl orthoformate (20 mL) was added and part of methanol was distilled off.<br>
When   the   temperature   of   the   reaction   mixture   reached 95-100°C,     all     the     solid    dissolved     in     the     flask.     The : solution    was    cooled    to    room   temperature    and   added    with anhydrous   Na2C03    (5   g) ,    stirring   for   30   min.   Subsequently the   solution  was   filtered  and  the   residue  was   distilled  by fractional    distillation    under    vacuum    at    0.25    mmHgi.     The first   fraction   at   low   temperature   mainly   consisted   of   the trimethyl    orthoformate    excess    and    the     second    fraction, which   distilled    as    colourless   oil    at    175-180°C,    was    the desired acetal.   Yield:   37  g   (70%).<br>

A solution of (2R, 3S) -3- (N-Boc) amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid methyl ester (IXA) (34.375 g, 125 mmol) in anhydrous THF (150 ml) was added with distilled 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (30 g, 142 mmol) and subsequently pyridinium p-toluenesulf onate (Py.Tos,-: 400 mg) .<br>
The solution was heated under mild reflux in a 500 ml three-necked, flask, equipped with .a Dean-Stark separator. After about 6 hours under reflux, about 60 ml of THF containing methanol generated during the reaction were removed. A sample was taken for 1H NMR analysis (in CDC13).<br>
The peak at 6 = 1.41 ppm disappeared (1) and a novel peak appeared at 6 = 1.24 ppm for the protected met.hyl! •'ester (2). After 6 hour reflux, the conversion was about 70-75%.<br>
A fresh aliquot of anhydrous THF (50 ml) was added, then an amount of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde acetal (15,0 g; 24 mmol) . The reaction mixture was refluxed for a further 2.5 hours, during which time about 50 ml of THF were removed using the Dean-Stark apparatus. The subsequent 1H NMR analysis showed the complete transformation of the starting material.<br>
The reaction mixture was added with a NaHC03 saturated aqueous solution (15 ml) and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes to neutralize Py.Tos. t-Butyl methyl ether (85 ml) and water (15 ml) were subsequently added and the organic phase was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with t-butyl methyl ether (20 ml) and the combined organic phases were washed with water (30 ml) and evaporated to a residue (66 g) of crude product X.<br>

The crude ester X (22 g, 42 mmol) was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol and added with water (50 ml) containing 8.7 g of potassium carbonate. After stirring overnight at room temperature, the reaction was considered completed by TLC<br>
monitoring (toluene-ethyl acetate: 4.5:1). TLC analysis was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis, checking the disappearance of the methyl ester peak.<br>
Methanol was evaporated at a temperature not above 40°C under vacuum (about 60 g residue) and water (150 ml) was added to the residue. The aqueous suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (5x50 ml) to remove the benzaldehyde and benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal excess. 90 ml of methylene chloride were added to the aqueous phase, the mixture was cooled on ice bath and the diphasic system was treated with about 125 ml of 1M NaHSO4 (pH = 3) under<br>
strong stirring. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with methylene chloride (75 ml-) . The combined methylene chloride extracts were washed with water (30 ml), brine (30 ml) and dried over MgS04. The solution was then kept at -60°C until next use. The yield in the final product as colourless solid was of 16 g, abo:ut 93% based on the starting product.<br>
