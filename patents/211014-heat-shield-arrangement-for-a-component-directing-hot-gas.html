				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a heat-shield component<br>
which is part of a hot-gas wall to be cooled. Further-<br>
more, the invention relates to a heat-shield arrangement<br>
which lines a hot-gas space, in particular a combustion<br>
chamber of a gas-turbine plant, and has a plurality of<br>
heat-shield components.<br>
On account of the high temperatures which prevail<br>
in hot-gas passages or other hot-gas spaces, it is<br>
necessary for the inner wall of a hot-gas passage to be<br>
designed in the best possible way in terms of temper-<br>
ature-resistance. On the one hand, high-temperature-<br>
resistant materials, such as, for example, ceramics, are<br>
suitable for this purpose. The disadvantage of ceramic<br>
materials lies both in their great brittleness and in<br>
their unfavourable heat and temperature conductivity. A<br>
suitable alternative to ceramic materials for heat<br>
shields are high-temperature-resistant metal alloys on an<br>
iron, chromium, nickel or cobalt basis. However, since<br>
the service temperature of high-temperature-resistant<br>
metal alloys is markedly below the maximum service<br>
temperature of ceramic materials, it is necessary to cool<br>
metallic heat shields in hot-gas passages.<br>
One possibility is proposed, for example, by<br>
Craemer in US 4,838,031 of 13 th June 1989. Craemer<br>
proposes a panel which consists of four components and is<br>
to be mounted on the inside of a combustion-chamber<br>
casing. In this case, the top layer facing the hot-gas<br>
space is made of a refractory metal, but may also be<br>
formed by a ceramic material. This is followed underneath<br>
by a layer of steel-wool-like metallic filaments. These<br>
filaments rest on a relatively large number of column-<br>
like supports. These column-like supports and the<br>
cavities in between form the third layer. The column-like<br>
supports are attached to a fourth metallic layer. The<br>
steel-wool-like metallic filaments of the second layer<br>
absorb heat energy from the overlying layer forming the<br>
inner burner wall and transfer said heat energy to the<br>
air flow directed between the column-like supports. In<br>
this case, the cavities of the third layer, via passages<br>
which lead through the fourth layer and the burner<br>
casing, are connected to a space outside the burner, and<br>
this space is fed with air via a compressor. The<br>
compressed air, as coolant, can pass through these<br>
passages into the cavity formed by the layers.<br>
In addition, a second type of passage is distri-<br>
buted over the front and centre region of the combustion<br>
chamber, through which passages the air originating from<br>
the exterior of the combustion chamber passes through the<br>
combustion-chamber casing and the layered panels into the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
The proposal by Craemer has the disadvantage that<br>
cool eiir flows into the combustion chamber over the<br>
entire region of the latter without having participated<br>
in the combustion. As a consequence thereof, the temper-<br>
ature at the outlet of the combustion chamber drops.<br>
A heat-shield arrangement, in particular for.<br>
structtiral parts of gas-turbine plants, is described in<br>
EP 0 224 817 B1. The heat-shield arrangement has an inner<br>
lining which is made of heat-resistant material and is<br>
composed of heat-shield elements in such a way as to<br>
cover the surface, which heat-shield elements are<br>
anchored to the supporting structure. These heat-shield<br>
elements are arranged next to one another while leaving<br>
gaps for the throughflow of cooling fluid and are<br>
thermally movable. Each of these heat-shield elements has<br>
a cap part and a shank part like a mushroom. The cap part<br>
is a flat or spatial, polygonal plate body having<br>
straight or curved boundary lines. The shank part con-<br>
nects the central region of the plate body to the sup-<br>
porting structure. The cap part preferably has a tri-<br>
angular shape, as a result of which an inner lining of<br>
virtually any geometry can be produced by identical cap<br>
parts. The cap parts as well as if need be other parts of<br>
the heat-shield elements are made of a high-temperature-<br>
resistant material, in particular a steel. The supporting<br>
structure has bores through which a cooling fluid, in<br>
particular air, can flow into an intermediate space<br>
between cap part and supporting structure and can flow<br>
from there through the gaps, intended for the throughflow<br>
of the cooling fluid, into a spatial region, for example<br>
a combustion chamber of a gas-turbine plant, surrounded<br>
by the heat-shield elements. This cooling fluid flow<br>
reduces the ingress of hot gas into the intermediate<br>
space.<br>
Described in DE 35 42 532 A1 is a wall, in<br>
particular for gas-turbine plants, which has cooling-<br>
fluid passages. In gas-turbine plants, the wall is<br>
preferably arranged between a hot space and a cooling-<br>
fluid space. It is assembled from individual wall<br>
elements, each of the wall elements being a plate body<br>
made of a high-temperature-resistant material. Each plate<br>
body has parallel cooling passages which are distributed<br>
over its surface area and communicate at one end with the<br>
cooling-fluid space and at the other end with the hot<br>
space. The cooling fluid, flowing into the hot space and<br>
directed through the cooling-fluid passages, forms a<br>
cooling-fluid film on that surface of the wall element<br>
and/or adjacent wall elements which faces the hot space.<br>
In summary, all of these heat-shield arrange-<br>
ments, in particular for gas-turbine combustion chambers,<br>
are based on the principle that compressor air is<br>
utilized as cooling medium for the combustion chamber and<br>
its lining and also as sealing air. The cooling and<br>
sealing air enters the combustion chamber without having<br>
participated in the combustion. This cold air mixes with<br>
the hot gas. As a result, the temperature at the outlet<br>
of the combustion chamber drops. Therefore the output of<br>
the gas turbine and the efficiency of the thermodynamic<br>
process decrease. Partial compensation may be carried out<br>
by a higher flame temperature being set. However, this<br>
then results in material problems, and higher emission<br>
values have to be tolerated. It is likewise a dis-<br>
advantage with the arrangements specified that, in the<br>
case of the air fed to the burner, pressure losses result<br>
due to the entry of the cooling fluid into the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
Described in the subsequently published WO I<br>
9 8/13 645 A1 is a heat-shield component with cooling-fluid<br>
return, having a hot-gas wall to be cooled, an inlet<br>
passage for cooling fluid, and an outlet passage for the<br>
cooling fluid, the inlet passage being directed towards<br>
the hot-gas wall and widening in the direction of the<br>
hot-gas wall. The inlet passage is largely surrounded by<br>
the outlet passage. The supporting structure is designed<br>
as a twin-wall structure, having an outer wall and an<br>
inner wall arranged parallel to and adjacent to the outer<br>
wall while leaving an intermediate space. For fastening<br>
to the supporting structure, the heat-shield component,<br>
at the outlet passage, has a fastening part with which<br>
the outlet passage is put onto the outer wall and<br>
fastened to the latter. Inside the outlet passage, the<br>
outer wall has an opening through which the inlet passage<br>
is directed while leaving a gap. The inner wall has a<br>
further opening into which the inlet passage is pushed<br>
over a short length. Cooling fluid can be fed to the<br>
heat-shield component via the inlet passage and dis-<br>
charged via the outlet passage. The inlet passage is<br>
covered with a cover wall which has impingement-cooling<br>
openings. Through the impingement-cooling opening,<br>
cooling fluid fed from the inlet passage can strike the<br>
hot-gas wall, in the course of which the latter is<br>
cooled.<br>
The object of the invention, for a hot-gas space<br>
of a plant, is to specify a heat-shield component which<br>
can be cooled with a cooling fluid as well as a heat-<br>
shield arrangement having heat-shield components, which<br>
heat-shield arrangement permits economical operation of<br>
the plant.<br>
The object which relates to the heat-shield<br>
component is achieved according to the invention by a<br>
heat-shield component which can be attached to a support-<br>
ing structure and has an outer hollow body which encloses<br>
an insert with an intermediate space formed between the<br>
outer hollow body and the insert, the outer hollow body<br>
having a first base side which can be exposed to a hot<br>
gas and side walls, and the insert having side walls and<br>
a second base side having a plurality of openings for the<br>
passage of cooling fluid into the intermediate space, the<br>
outer hollow body and the insert in each case being<br>
attachable to the supporting structure. The heat-shield<br>
component can be attached to the supporting structure<br>
without the supporting structure having to be penetrated<br>
by the heat-shield component. As a result, the supporting<br>
structure can be configured largely with a closed sur-<br>
face, in which case relatively small openings, such as<br>
bores or the like, may be provided if need be, for<br>
example for fastening the heat-shield component in the<br>
supporting structure, which bores can be made in a<br>
mechanically simple manner.<br>
The side walls of the insert can preferably be<br>
put onto the supporting structure in such a way that an<br>
interior space, which is defined by the insert and the<br>
supporting structure, is formed. An interior space<br>
fluidically connected to the intermediate space via the<br>
openings is thereby formed, into which interior space a<br>
cooling fluid can be directed to begin with, and this<br>
cooling fluid flows through the openings into the inter-<br>
mediate space and strikes the first base side in order to<br>
cool the latter.<br>
In particular, the top edges of the side walls of<br>
the hollow body are disposed on the supporting structure<br>
along the full periphery of the heat-shield component and<br>
largely seal off the space, in which the cooling fluid is<br>
located, relative to the hot-gas space. The side walls of<br>
the hollow body preferably have a geometrical form which<br>
enables a seal to be introduced between hollow body and<br>
supporting structure. The seal may be designed, for<br>
example, as a compression seal. In this case, due to the<br>
geometry of the hollow body, the seal lies on the cold<br>
side of the heat-shield component.<br>
The insert is also preferably exchangeable. The<br>
heat-shield component is thereby configured in such a way<br>
that, if need be, the insert or the outer hollow body can<br>
in each case be exchanged on its own.<br>
A first outer hollow body and a second outer<br>
hollow body are preferably attachable next to one another<br>
on the supporting structure, a side wall of the first<br>
outer hollow body and a side wall of the second outer<br>
hollow body being adjacent to one another while leaving<br>
a gap, the side walls in each case having a surface<br>
contour such that the gap is winding. As a result, the<br>
gap forms a choke point via which hot gas directed<br>
outside the heat-shield component can penetrate into the<br>
gap only with difficulty or cooling fluid issuing from<br>
the heat-shield component can pass through the gap only<br>
with difficulty. This can be achieved, for example, by<br>
interlocking steps or indentations of adjacent side walls<br>
of hollow bodies. As a result, cooling fluid or hot gas<br>
passing into the gap is deflected several times.<br>
The inner base side of the hollow body can<br>
preferably have cooling ribs or the like, as a result of<br>
which the cooling with a cooling fluid can be optimized.<br>
The heat-shield components are preferably<br>
fastened to the supporting structure via a centrally<br>
attached retaining bolt. The retaining bolt may be<br>
provided with disc springs so that greater resilience is<br>
ensured if the heat-shield component exceeds the<br>
permissible expansion. For reasons of simple assembly,<br>
the retaining bolt can be attached to the hot side of the<br>
heat-shield component. However, it is also possible for<br>
the restaining bolt to be located on the cold side of the<br>
heat-shield component. The latter has an advantageous<br>
effect on the corrosion properties of the heat-shield<br>
component.<br>
The base side of the hollow body may alternative-<br>
ly have a triangular, four-cornered (in particular<br>
quadrilateral or trapezoidal) or hexagonal surface area.<br>
Other suitable geometrical forms are also possible. For<br>
quadratic base sides of the hollow body, the typical<br>
order of magnitude is around 200 mm edge length. The wall<br>
thickness of the base side of the hollow body is prefer-<br>
ably less than 10 mm, in particular preferably between 3<br>
and 5 mm. A relatively small temperature difference<br>
between inner and outer surfaces of the base side of the<br>
hollow body is thereby ensured. A high alternating-load<br>
resistance of the heat-shield component can thus be<br>
achieved.<br>
The heat-shield component is made of a heat-<br>
resistant material, in particular a metal or a metal<br>
alloy. It is advantageous to produce the heat-shield<br>
component, in particular the hollow body, as an invest-<br>
ment casting.<br>
The object which relates to the heat-shield<br>
arrangement is achieved according to the invention by a<br>
heat-shield arrangement which comprises a plurality of<br>
heat-shield components which are arranged next to one<br>
another on a supporting structure, a heat-shield<br>
component being attachable to the supporting structure<br>
and having an outer hollow body which encloses an insert<br>
with an intermediate space formed between the outer<br>
hollow body and the insert, the outer hollow body having<br>
a first base side which can be exposed to a hot gas and<br>
side walls, and the insert having side walls and a second<br>
base side having a plurality of openings for the passage<br>
of cooling fluid into the intermediate space, the outer<br>
hollow body and the insert in each case being attachable<br>
to the supporting structure, and a wall of a component<br>
directing hot gas, in particular of a combustion chamber<br>
of a gas-turbine plant, which wall can be exposed to a<br>
hot gas, being formed by the base sides of the heat-<br>
shield component.<br>
A component directing hot gas, in particular a<br>
combustion chamber of a gas turbine, can be lined with<br>
such a heat-shield arrangement, the heat-shield arrange-<br>
ment protecting the supporting structure, which may, for<br>
example, be a wall of the combustion chamber, against the<br>
heat effect caused by the hot gas. The individual heat-<br>
shield components can be cooled with a closed cooling-<br>
fluid circuit.<br>
The supporting structure for the heat-shield<br>
component preferably has in each case an inlet passage<br>
for cooling fluid in a first region inside the side walls<br>
of the insert and an outlet passage into the intermediate<br>
space for cooling fluid. In this way, cooling fluid can<br>
be directed via the inlet passage into the insert of a<br>
heat-shield component, from which the cooling fluid<br>
passes through the openings into the intermediate space<br>
for impingement cooling of the respective first base<br>
side. The cooling fluid can be discharged from the<br>
intermediate space via the outlet passage.<br>
It is also preferable for the inlet passage to be<br>
connected to a feed passage, which is arranged outside<br>
the hot-gas space, and for the outlet passage to be<br>
connected to a discharge passage, which is likewise<br>
arranged outside the hot-gas space. Thus, cooling fluid<br>
can be fed to the inlet passage via the feed passage, and<br>
the cooling fluid heated after the impingement cooling<br>
can be discharged via the outlet passage and a discharge<br>
passage. In this way, cooling fluid can be directed in a<br>
closed cooling-fluid circuit.<br>
The cooling fluid can preferably be fed to the<br>
heat-shiesld component from a compressor, in particular of<br>
a gas turbine, via the feed passage and is discharged via<br>
the discharge passage, and in the process is fed in<br>
particular to a burner. The cooling fluid can therefore<br>
be bled from a compressor in a simple manner and, heated<br>
after a cooling action, can be fed to a burner for the<br>
combustion. All the compressor air can therefore be<br>
supplied to the combustion.<br>
This ensures that the cooling fluid merely flows<br>
through the heat-shield component and is not able to<br>
penetrate into the hot-gas space. Due to this complete<br>
return of the cooling air from the heat-shield<br>
components, mixing of hot gas and cooling fluid accord-<br>
ingly does not occur, so that, if need be, a lower hot-<br>
gas temperature can be set in a gas-turbine plant. This<br>
is associated with a reduction in the nitrogen-oxide<br>
pollution. Due to the closed cooling-air return, there is<br>
likewise no flow around the edges of a heat-shield<br>
component, so that a largely uniform temperature dis-<br>
tribution with low thermal stresses occurs in the<br>
material of the heat-shield component.<br>
The supply of cooling air to the heat-shield<br>
component and the return of the heated cooling air to a<br>
burner of the gas-turbine plant are preferably effected<br>
via axially parallel supply passages. The passages can be<br>
widened as desired in the radial direction and their<br>
cross-sections can be adapted to the requisite cooling-<br>
air quantities. All the heat-shield components therefore<br>
have essentially identical cooling-air inlet conditions.<br>
The flow path to the heat-shield components or of heated<br>
cooling air to the burner is only affected by relatively<br>
slight pressure losses on account of its shortness.<br>
Furthermore, pressure losses no longer occur<br>
owing to the fact that no cooling fluid penetrates into<br>
the hot-gas space. The supply to the heat-shield<br>
components arranged on an outer side of a rotationally<br>
symmetrical component directing hot gas, in particular a<br>
combustion chamber of a gas-turbine plant, is preferably<br>
effected via the guide blades of the first guide-blade<br>
row of the gas turbine. If the quantity of cooling air<br>
which can be directed through the guide blades is insuf-<br>
ficient for adequate cooling of the heat-shield<br>
components, it is possible to direct supply passages past<br>
the outer side of the component directing hot gas, in<br>
particular the combustion chamber.<br>
The return of the heated cooling air is prefer-<br>
ably effected via separate discharge passages which lead<br>
directly to a burner of a gas-turbine plant. It is<br>
likewise possible to lead the outlet passage of the heat-<br>
shield components directly into a main passage in which<br>
the compressor air is fed to the burner. In this way, the<br>
heat absorbed in the heat-shield components can be fed<br>
again to the gas-turbine process in an especially favour-<br>
able manner.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a heat-shield<br>
component and a heat-shield arrangement in a gas-turbine<br>
plant is given below. In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a gas-turbine plant partly cut open in<br>
longitudinal direction and having an annular<br>
combustion chamber,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal section through a heat-<br>
shield component having a supporting structure,<br>
a feed passage and a discharge passage, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a sectional representation of the side<br>
walls of adjacent hollow bodies, which are put<br>
onto a supporting structure.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a gas-turbine plant 10 which is<br>
shown partly cut open longitudinally. The gas-turbine<br>
plant. 10 has a shaft 2 6 and, connected one behind the<br>
other in the axial direction, a compressor 9, an annular<br>
combustion chamber 11 and the blading (guide blades 18,<br>
moving blades 27) . Combustion air is compressed and<br>
heated in the compressor 9, and this combustion air is<br>
partly fed as cooling fluid 4(shown in fig-2) to a heat-shield arrange-<br>
ment 20. The compressed air is fed to a plurality of<br>
burners 25 which are arranged in a circle around the<br>
annular combustion chamber 11. A fuel (not shown) burned<br>
with the compressor air in the burners 25 forms a hot gas<br>
29 in the combustion chamber 11, and this hot gas 29<br>
flows out of the combustion chamber 11 into the blading<br>
of the gas-turbine plant 10 (guide blade 18, moving blade<br>
27) and thus causes the shaft 2 6 to rotate.<br>
In this case, provision is made for the entire<br>
combustion-chamber wall to be lined with the heat-shield<br>
components according to the invention, which have the<br>
form of hollow tiles, or for it to be composed of such<br>
tiles,which are held on a supporting structure outside<br>
the combustion space.<br>
A heat-shield component is schematically shown in<br>
Fig. 2. The heat-shield component as a whole has the<br>
reference numeral 1. It has a hollow body 100, the base<br>
side 101 of which can be exposed to a hot gas. This<br>
("first") base side 101 is exposed to a hot-gas stream<br>
29. The hollow body 100 is laterally defined by the side<br>
walls 102. These side walls 102 are disposed with their<br>
bottom margin on the supporting structure 17. A further<br>
smaller hollow body is located as insert 110 in the<br>
hollow body 100. This insert 110 has passage openings 113<br>
at its base side 111. The insert 110 is laterally defined<br>
by its side walls 112. The side walls 112 are disposed<br>
with their margin on the supporting structure 17. An<br>
interior space 150, which is defined by the insert 110<br>
and the supporting structure 17, is thereby formed. Also<br>
formed in this way is an intermediate space 151, which is<br>
defined by the insert 110, the hollow body 100 and the<br>
supporting structure 17. In the region 162 which is<br>
located between the side walls 112 of the insert 110, the<br>
supporting structure 17 has one or more inlet passages 3,<br>
through which a cooling fluid 4 can pass into the<br>
interior space 150. Furthermore, the supporting structure<br>
17 has outlet passages 5 into the intermediate space 151.<br>
For impingement cooling of the base side 101, cooling<br>
fluid 4 flows through the inlet passages 3 into the<br>
interior space 150 of the insert 110 and passes through<br>
the passage openings 113 into the intermediate space 151,<br>
in the course of which it strikes the inside 103 of the<br>
base side 101. The cooling fluid heated after the<br>
impingement cooling is discharged from the intermediate<br>
space via the outlet passages 5, as indicated by the<br>
arrows in Fig. 2. The cooling fluid 4 is therefore<br>
directed in a closed circuit. This avoids a situation in<br>
which the cooling fluid 4 passes into the hot-gas space<br>
37.<br>
By the attachment of seals 34, it is possible to<br>
prevent leakage flows between the supporting structure 17<br>
and the side wall 102, sitting thereon, of the hollow<br>
body 100. Here, the seals 34 are designed as compression<br>
seals, the side wall 102 of the hollow body 100 having a<br>
shoulder, by means of which the seal 34 is pressed onto<br>
the supporting structure 17 in the region of the connect-<br>
ing point between the side wall 102 of the hollow body<br>
100 and the supporting structure 17.<br>
The cooling fluid 4 is supplied in such a way<br>
that the cooling fluid 4 is fed to the inlet passages 3<br>
from a compressor 9 through a feed passage 12. In this<br>
case, this feed passage 12 lies outside the hot-gas space<br>
37. The cooling fluid 4 is discharged via a discharge<br>
passage 13 likewise lying outside the hot-gas space 37.<br>
The cooling fluid 4 can be fed, for example, to the<br>
burner 2 5 through this discharge passage 13.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown, the heat-<br>
shield component 1 is fixed to the supporting structure<br>
17 by a retaining bolt 130. This retaining bolt 130 is<br>
arranged in the centre of the rectangular embodiment<br>
shown. Its axis is oriented along the main axis 32 of the<br>
heat-shield component. In the exemplary embodiment, the<br>
retaining bolt is made with a thickened portion on the<br>
hot side of the heat-shield component 1 and is mounted<br>
with its thinner end on the supporting structure 17. The<br>
retaining bolt may be provided with disc springs (not<br>
shown here) in order to compensate for a situation in<br>
which the permissible thermal expansion of the heat-<br>
shield component 1 is exceeded.<br>
If the insert 110 and the hollow body 100 are<br>
connected in a mechanically detachable manner only via<br>
the retaining bolt 13 0, the inserts can be exchanged for<br>
other inserts which produce another cooling-fluid flow<br>
zone in the intermediate space 35 between the hollow body<br>
100 and the insert 110. The cooling conditions for the<br>
base side 101 of the hollow body 100 can thereby be<br>
adapted to the specific requirements which result from<br>
the position of the heat-shield component 1 in the hot-<br>
gas passage.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cutaway portion of a heat-shield<br>
arrangement. The heat-shield arrangement is formed from<br>
a plurality of heat-shield components arranged on the<br>
supporting structure 17, only two heat-shield components<br>
100 and 100A being shown for the sake of clarity, in<br>
which case two side walls 102 and 102A of two adjacent<br>
hollow bodies 100 and 100A as well as a part of the<br>
supporting structure 17 can be seen. Here, cooling ribs<br>
on the first base side, which run radially relative to<br>
the side walls 102, are indicated by 115 and 115A. The<br>
base sides 101 and 101A of the heat-shield components 100<br>
and 100A, with the base sides of the heat-shield<br>
components which are not shown in any more detail, form<br>
a wall 160 which can be exposed to a hot gas.<br>
The adjacent side walls 102 of the hollow bodies<br>
100 have a mutually corresponding surface contour. This<br>
surface contour is configured in such a way that the side<br>
wall 102A of the hollow body 100A shown on the right-hand<br>
side in the drawing has a shoulder 105, with which a<br>
mating shoulder 104 of the side wall 102 of the hollow<br>
body 100 shown on the left-hand side corresponds. Due to<br>
this shaping with shoulder 105 and mating shoulder 104,<br>
no linear gap 3 6 leads to the supporting structure 17<br>
from the hot-gas space 37.<br>
This ensures even better protection of the<br>
supporting structure 17 from heating by the hot gas in<br>
the hot-gas space 37. Since the hollow bodies 100 can be<br>
manufactured by the investment-casting process,<br>
geometrical forms such as those described cause no<br>
manufacturing difficulties. It is of course also<br>
possible, for the side walls 102 and 102A of the hollow<br>
bodies 100 and 100A, to select other geometrical forms in<br>
which a linear gap between hot-gas space 37 and support-<br>
ing structure 17 is avoided.<br>
