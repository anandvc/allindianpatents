METHOD OF PRODUCING CYCLIC OLEFIN POLYMERS<br>
HAVING POLAR FUNCŢIONAL GROUPS, OLEFIN POLYMER<br>
PRODUCED USING THE METHOD AND OPTICAL<br>
ANISOTROPIC FILM COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a method of producing cyclic olefin polymers, and<br>
more particularly, to a method of producing cyclic olefin polymers having polar funcţional groups using a catalyst composed of a Group 10 metal compound and a phosphonium salt compound, olefin polymers produced using the method, and an optical anisotropic film comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Inorganic materials such as silicon oxides or nitrides have been mainly utilized in<br>
the information and electronic industries. R ecent technical developments and demands for compact and high efficiency devices need new high performance materials. In this respect, a great deal of attention has been paid to polymers which have desirable physicochemical properties such as low dielectric constant and moisture absorption rate, high adhesion to metals, strength, thermal stability and transparency, and a high<br>
glass transition temperature (T &gt; 250 °C).<br>
g<br>
[3]	Such polymers can be used as insulating layers of semiconductors or TFT-LCDs,<br>
protecting films for polarizing plates, multichip modules, integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards, molding materials for electronic components or electronic materials for flat panel displays, etc.<br>
[4]	As one of new performance materials,cyclic olefin polymers which are composed<br>
of cyclic olefin monomers such as norbornenes exhibit much more improved properties than convenţional olefin polymers, in that they show high transparency, heat resistance and chemical resistance, and have a low birefringence and moisture absorption rate. Thus, they can be applied to various applications, e.g., optical components such as CDs, DVDs and POFs (plastic optical fibers), information and electronic components such as capacitor films and low-dielectrics, and medical components such as low-absorbent syringes, blister packagings, etc.<br>
[5]	Cyclic olefin polymers are known to be prepared by one of the foliowing three<br>
methods: ROMP (ring opening metathesis polymerization), copolymerization with ethylene, and addition polymerization using catalysts containing transition metals such as Ni and Pd. These methods are depicted in Reaction Scheme l below. Depending on the central metal, ligand and cocatalyst of a catalyst used in the polymerization<br><br>
[6]  (Figure Removed)  reaction, polymerization characteristics and the structure and characteristics of polymers to be obtained may be varied. Reaction Scheme l<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[7]<br>
[8]<br>
[9]<br>
[10]<br><br>
In ROMP, a metal chloride such as TiCl or WC1 or a carbonyl-type organometallic<br>
4	6<br>
compound reacts with a cocatalyst such as Lewis acid, R Al or Et AICI to form active catalyst species such as a metal carbene or a metallocyclobutane which react with double bonds of olefm to provide a ring opened product having double bonds (Ivin, K. J.; O'Donnel, J. H.; Rooney, J. J.; Steward, C. D. Makromol. Chem. 1979, Voi. 180, 1975). A polymer prepared by the ROMP method nas one double bond per one monomeric repeating unit, thus, the polymer has poor thermal and oxidative stability and is mainly used as thermosetting resins.<br>
In order to improve physicochemical properties of polymers prepared by the ROMP method, a method of hydrogenation of the ROMP-polymer in the presence of Pd or Raney-Ni catalysts has been proposed. Hydrogenated polymer shows improved oxidative stability, but still needs to be improved in its thermal stability. Further, a cost increased due to additional processes is against its commercial application.<br>
Ethylene-norbornene copolymers are known to be first synthesized using a titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst by Leuna, Corp., (Koinzer, P. et al., DE Patent No. 109,224). However, impurities remaining in the copolymer deteriorates its<br>
transparency and its glass transition temperature (T ) is very low, i.e., 140 °C or lower.<br>
g<br>
As to the addition polymerization of cyclic olefinic monomers, Gaylord et al. reported a polymerization of norbornene using [Pd(C H CN)C1 ] as a catalyst<br>
65	22<br>
(Gaylord, N.G.; Deshpande, A.B.; Mandal, B.M.; Martan, M. J. Macromol. Sci.-Chem. 1977, Al 1(5), 1053-1070). Furthermore , Kaminsky et al. reported a homopoly-merization of norbornene using a zirconium-based rnetallocene catalyst (Kaminsky, W.; Bark, A.; Drake, I. Stud. Surf. Cătai. 1990, Voi. 56,425). These polymers havea<br>
high crystallinity, thermally decompose at a high temperature before they mei t, and are substantially insoluble in general organic solvents.<br>
[11]	Adhesion of polymers to inorganic surfaces such as silicon, silicon oxide, silicon<br>
nitride, alumina, copper, aluminium, gold, silver, platinum, nickel, tantalium, and chromium is often a criticai factor in the reliability of the polymer for use as electronic materials. The introduction of funcţional groups into norbornene monomers enables the control of chemical and physical properties of a resultant norbornene polymer.<br>
[12]	U.S. Patent No. 3,330,815 discloses a method of polymerizing norbornene<br>
monomers having a polar funcţional group. However, the catalyst is deactivated by polar funcţional groups of norbornene monomers, which results in an earlier termination of the polymerization reaction, thereby producing a norbornene polymer having a molecular weight of 10,000 or less.<br>
[13]	U.S. Patent No. 5,705,503 discloses a method of polymerizing norbornene<br>
monomers having a polar funcţional group using ((Allyl)PdCl) /AgSbF as a catalyst.<br>
2	6<br>
However, an excess of the catalyst is required (1/100 to 1/400 molar ratio relative to the monomer) and the removal of the catalyst residues after polymerization is difficult, which causes the transparency of the polymer to be deteriorated due to a subsequent thermal oxidation.<br>
[14]	Sen et al. reported a method for polymerizing various ester norbornene monomers<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, [Pd(CH CN) ][BF ] , in which exo isomers were se-<br>
3	4	42<br>
lectively polymerized, and the polymerization yield was low. (Sen et al., /. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1981, Voi. 103,4627-4629). In addition, a large amount of the catalyst is used<br>
(the ratio of catalyst to monomer is 1:100 to 1:400) and it is difficult to remove catalyst<br>
residues after the polymerization.<br>
[15]	U.S. Patent No. 6,455,650 issued to Lipian et al. discloses a method of<br>
polymerizing norbornene monomers having a funcţional group in the presence of a small amount of a catalyst, [(R1) M(L') (L1) ] [WCA] . However, the product yield in a<br>
z	x	y   b	d<br>
polymerization of a polar monomer such as an ester-norbornene, is only 5%. Thus, this<br>
method is not suitable for the preparation of polymers having polar funcţional groups.<br>
[16]	Sen et al. reported a method for polymerizing an ester-norbornene in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system including [(l,5-Cyclooctadiene)(CH )Pd(Cl)], PPh , and Na+ [3,5-(CF ) C H ] B", in which the polymerization yield of ester-norbornenes is 40% or<br>
32634<br>
lower, the molecular weight of the polymer is 6,500 or lower, and the molar amount of the catalyst used is about 1/400 based on the monomer (Sen et al., Organometallics 2001, Voi. 20,2802-2812).<br>
[17]	Therefore, there is still a demand for an addition-polymerization of cyclic olefins<br>
having polar funcţional groups which is able to meet a certam desired level in the aspect of polymerization yield, a molecular weight of a resultant polymer, and a rnolar<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[42]	A method of producing cyclic olefm polymers having polar funcţional groups<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention includes : preparing a catalyst mixture including (i) a procatalyst represented by formula (1) containing a group 10 metal and a ligand containing hetero atoms bonded to the metal and (ii) a cocatalyst represented by formula (2) including a salt compound which is capable of providing a phosphonium cation and an anion weakly coordinating to the metal of the procatalyst; and addition-polymerizing cyclic olefm monomers having polar funcţional groups in the presence of an organic solvent and the catalyst mixture, at a temperature of 80-150 °C.<br>
[43]	In the present embodiment, the deactivation of a catalyst due to a polar funcţional<br>
group of the monomer, moisture and oxygen can be prevented, the catalyst is thermally and chemically stable, thereby a high yield and a high molecular weight of the cyclic olefin polymer can be achieved with a small amount of the catalyst and the removal process of the catalyst residue is not required.<br>
[44]	In formula (1), an arrow represents that a hetero atom or C=C bond of a ligand co-<br>
ordinates to a metal, which is called the dative bond.<br>
[45]	In the method, the procatalyst is very stable even in the presence of a monomer<br>
having a polar funcţional group, moisture and oxygen and the phosphonium cocatalyst does not generate an amine which is produced by the ammonium borate to poison the catalyst. Further, in the reaction of the procatalyst with the cocatalyst, a phosphine is formed to stabilize the cationic species, thereby inhibiting the deactivation of the catalyst by a polar funcţional group of a monomer, moisture and oxygen.<br>
[46]	As to a polymerization temperature, in the case of general organometallic poly-<br>
merization catalysts, when the polymerization temperature increases, the polymerization yield increases, whereas a molecular weight of a polymer decreases or catalysts lose the polymerization activity by thermal decomposition (Kaminsky et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1985, voi 24, 507; Brookhart et al. Chem. Rev. 2000, voi 100, 1169; Resconi et al. Chem. Rev. 2000, voi 100, 1253).<br>
[47]	Meanwhile, a polar group of a norbornene monomer interacts with the catalyst at<br>
room temperature to preveni the double bond of a norbornene from coordinating to an active site of the catalyst, thereby resulting in decrease in the polymerization yield and the molecular weight. However, when the polymerization temperature increases, the double bond of a norbornene is easy to insert into the metal-growing polymer chain bond to increase the activity and a p -hydrogen of a growing polymer chain bonded to the metal cannot forai a stereo structural environment to be eliminated where it can interact with the catalyst in view of inherent properties of the norbornene monomer, thereby increasing the molecular weight of the polymer (Kaminsky et al. Macromol. Symp. 1995, voi 97, 225). Thus, it is necessary to increase the polymerization temperature. However, most catalysts conventionally used to produce polynorbornenes<br>
having polar funcţional groups tend to be decomposed at 80 °C or higher, and thus polymers having high molecular weights cannot be obtained in a high yield. However, the catalyst of the present embodiment is thermally stable not to be decomposed at 80 °C or higher and prevents the interaction between the polar funcţional group of the norbornene monomer and the cationic catalyst, and thus a catalyst active site can be formed or recovered, thereby producing a high molecular weight cyclic olefin polymer having a polar funcţional group in a high yield. When the polymerization temperature is higher than 150 °C, catalyst components are decomposed in solution, and thus it is difficult to produce a cyclic olefm polymer having a polar funcţional group and a high molecular weight in a high yield.<br>
[48]	According to the method of the present embodiment, when a polar funcţional group<br>
in a monomer is an acetyl group, a high yield in polymerization can be obtained with a high molecular weight, which is supported by Examples and Comparative Examples. The catalyst mixture is stable even in the presence of polar funcţional groups, moisture, oxygen, and other impurities. Thus, while convenţional catalysts have good activity only in-situ and in the absence of air, the catalyst mixture of the present embodiment can be stored in a solution for a long period of time, the isolation of solvent is not required, and its activity is maintained even in air. Therefore, the method of the present embodiment can reproducibly be used under various preparation conditions, which is particularly important in industrial mass-production.<br>
[49]	That is, the catalyst mixture including (i) a procatalyst represented by formula (l)<br>
containing a group 10 metal and a ligand containing hetero atoms bonded to the metal and (ii) a cocatalyst represented by formula (2) including a salt compound which is capable of providing a phosphonium cation and an weakly coordinating anion is not decomposed at the polymerization temperature of 80-150 °C and is stable in the presence of polar funcţional groups, moisture and oxygen, and shows high activity.<br>

formula (2a) or (2b):<br>

3	4<br>
isopropyl, t-butyl, n-butyl or ethyl.<br>
[65]	The phosphonium compound used as the cocatalyst in the method has an elec-<br>
tronically stabilizing ability and thermally and chemically activates transition metal compounds. In the method, the molar ratio of the cocatalyst to the procatalyst containing group 10 transition metal is in the range of 0.5:1-10:1. When the molar ratio of the cocatalyst to the procatalyst is less than 0.5: l, the effect of activating the procatalyst is inefficient. When the molar ratio of the cocatalyst to the procatalyst is greater than 10: l, an excess of phosphonium compound coordinates to the metal to prevent a norbornene monomer from coordinating to the metal and the cationic catalyst active species is too electronically stabilized to interact with the double bond of a norbornene monomer, thereby resulting in decreasing both polymerization yield and molecular weight.<br>
[66]	The catalyst mixture including the procatalyst and the cocatalyst may be supported<br>
on an inorganic support. The inorganic support may be silica, litania, silica/chromia, silica/chromia/titania, silica/alumina, aluminum phosphate gel, silanized silica, silica hydrogel, montmorillonite clay or zeolite. When the catalyst mixture is supported on an inorganic support, a molecular weight distribution of a polymer can be controlled by selecting inorganic support and the polymer morphology can be improved.<br>
[61]	The catalyst mixture can be directly used in a solid phase without a solvent or can<br>
be mixed in a solvent to form a preformed catalyst in the form of a mixture or a complex of the respective catalyst components, i.e. the group 10 metal compound and the phosphonium compound . Further, each catalyst components can be directly added into the polymerization reaction system without being preformed. When the catalyst mixture is dissolved in a solvent, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, toluene, chlorobenzene or a mixture thereof can be used as the solvent.<br>
[68]	The total amount of the organic solvent in the reaction system may be 50-800%,<br>
and preferably 50-400%, by weight of based on the total monomer in the monomer solution. When the total amount of the organic solvent in the reaction system is less than 50% based on the weight of the total monomer in the monomer solution, the mixing in the polymerization reaction is difficult due to high viscosity of the polymer<br>
solution. When the total amount of the organic solvent in the reaction system is greater than 800% based on the weight of the total monomer in the monomer solution, both the polymerization yield and the molecular weight are reduced due to slow poly-merization rate.<br>
[69]	In the polymerization reaction system, the molar ratio of the catalyst mixture based<br>
on the Group 10 transition metal compound to the monomers contained in the monomer solution is in the range of 1:2,500 -1:200,000. This ratio of the catalyst to the monomers is far smaller than that used in convenţional polymerization reaction system for preparing a polar cyclic olefm polymer, however it is sufficient to exhibit catalytic activity in the method of the present invention for preparing a high molecular weight of a cyclic olefm polymer. Preferably, the molar ratio of the catalyst system to the monomers is in the range of 1: 5,000~1: 20,000, and more preferably 1:10,000-1:15,000.<br>
[70]	When the molar ratio of the procatalyst to the monomer is greater than 1:2,500, it is<br>
difficult to remove the catalyst residue in polymer. When the molar ratio of the procatalyst to the monomer is less than 1:200,000, the catalytic activity is low.<br>
[71]	A norbornene addition polymer having a polar funcţional group produced using the<br>
method of the present embodiment includes at least 0.1-99.9 mol% of a norbornene-based monomer having a polar funcţional group, in which the norbornene having a polar funcţional group is composed of a mixture of endo and exo isomers and the dete-rioration of the catalytic activity by endo-isomers containing polar funcţional groups can be avoided and thus a composition ratio of the mixture is not criticai for polymerization performance. In the method, the monomer solution may further include cyclic olefin having non-polar funcţional group.<br>
[72]	In accordance with the method of the invention, a homopolymer is prepared by<br>
polymerizing same norbornene-based monomer containing a polar funcţional group, or a copolymer including di-, tri- and multi-copolymers is prepared by polymerizing different polar funcţional norbornene-based monomers, or a copolymer including di-, tri- and multi-copolymers is prepared by polymerizing a polar funcţional norbornene-based monomer and a norbornene monomer having non-polar funcţional group.<br>
[73]	In accordance with the method of the present invention, the cyclic olefin polymer<br>
containing polar funcţional groups having a molecular weight of 100,000 or more can be prepared in a yield of 40% or higher. In order to fabricate an optical film using the cycloolefin polymer, the molecular weight of the cycloolefin polymer is preferably controlled to 100,000-1,000,000. To control the molecular weight, a linear or branched cyclic C    olefin may be further used. Examples of the olefin include 1-hexene, 1-octene, cyclopentene, ethylene, etc. Such an olefin is added to the end of extending polymer chain and a (3 -hydrogen of the added olefin is easily eliminated, thereby<br>
producing a polymer having a desirable molecular weight.<br>
[74]	In convenţional polymerization system, cyclic olefin polymers containing polar<br>
funcţional groups is prepared in a very low yield and in a low molecular weight, whereas the present method produces a high molecular weight of a cycloolefin polymer containing polar funcţional groups in a high yield.<br>
[75]	A cyclic olefin polymer having a polar group according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention is provided. Preferably, a norbornene-based polymer having a polar funcţional group produced according to the method of the previous embodiment is an addition-polymer of a cyclic olefinic monomer represented by formula (3) and nas a weight average molecular weight (M ) of 10,000-1,000,000.<br>
w<br>
[76]	When the weight average molecular weight is less than 10,000, a brittle film can be<br>
produced. When the weight average molecular weight is greater than 1,000,000, it is difficult to dissolve the polymer in an organic solvent, and thus the processibility is poor.<br>
[77]	The norbornene-based polymer containing polar funcţional groups prepared in<br>
accordance with the method of the present invention is transparent, has sufficient adhesion to metals or polymers containing different polar funcţional groups, thermal stability and strength, and exhibits a low dielectric constant sufficient to be used as insulating electronic materials. The cyclic olefin polymer produced by the present invention has a desirable adhesion to substrates of electronic components without requiring a coupling agent, and at the same time, a sufficient adhesion to metal substrates, e.g., Cu, Ag and Au. Further, the cyclic olefin polymer of the present invention exhibits a desirable optical properties so that it can be used as materials for protective films of polarizing plates and electronic components such integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards, multichip modules, and the like.<br>
[78]	The polymer of the present embodiment can be used to produce an optical<br>
anisotropic film capable of controlling a birefringence, which could not be produced with the convenţional method.<br>
[79]	A conformational unit of a general cyclic olefin has one or two stable rotation<br>
conditions, and thus can achieve an extended form such as polyamide having a rigid phenyl ring as a backbone. When a polar funcţional group is introduced into a norbornene-based polymer with an extended form, the interaction between molecules increases compared to polymers having simple forms, and thus packing of molecules has a direcţional order, thereby producing optical and electronic anisotropy.<br>
[80]	The birefringence can be controlled according to the type and the amount of polar<br>
funcţional group in the cyclic olefin polymer. In particular, the birefringence in a direction through the film thickness is easily controlled, and thus the polymer of the present embodiment can be used to produce an optical compensation film for various<br>
modes of liquid crystal display (LCD).<br>
[81]	The optical anisotropic film of the cyclic olefin polymer having a polar funcţional<br>
group can be prepared by a solution casting or can be prepared with a blend of one or more cyclic olefin polymers.<br>
[82]	In order to prepare a film by solution casting, it is preferable to introduce a cyclic<br>
olefin polymer in a solvent in amount of 5-95% by weight, and preferably 10-60% by weight, and stirring the mixture at room temperature. The viscosity of the prepared solution is 100-10,000 cps, and more preferably 300-8000 cps for solution casting. To improve mechanical strength, heat resistance, light resistance, and manipulability of the film, additives such as a plasticizer, a anti-deterioration agent, a UV stabilizer or an antistatic agent can be added.<br>
[83]	The optical anisotropic film thus prepared has a retardation value (Rth) of 70 to<br>
1000 nm, as defmed by the following Equation l :<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
[84]	where n is a refractive index of an in-plane fast axis measured at 550 nm, n is a<br>
y	z<br>
refractive index toward thickness direction measured at 550 nm, and d is a film<br>
thickness.<br>
[85]	The optical anisotropic film meets a refractive index requirement of<br>
, in which n is a refractive index of an in-plane slow axis, n is a refractive index of an<br>
x	y<br>
in-plane fast axis, and n is a refractive index toward thickness direction , and thus can be used as a negative C-plate type optical compensation film for LCD.<br>

the following Examples. However, these Examples are given for the purpose of il-lustration and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
