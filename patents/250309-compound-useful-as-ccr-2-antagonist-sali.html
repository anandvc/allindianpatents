				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION CCR-2 ANTAGONIST SALT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
International patent applications US03/12929, filed April 25, 2003, and US03/13042, filed April 25, 2003, disclose tetrahydropyranyl cyclopentyl telrahydropyridopyridine compounds. These compounds are useful for the treatment of diseases or conditions of humans or other species which can be treated with inhibitors, modulators or promoters of chemokine receptor function. Such diseases or conditions include those mentioned in the referenced applications.<br>
((lR,3S)-3-Isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine, 1(Figure Removed) <br>
is a potent CCR-2 inhibitor. The laboratory preparation of compound 1, including the laboratory preparation of certain intermediates and precursors employed to in the synthesis of compound 1 is described in International patent applications US03/12929 and US03/13042.<br>
Prior techniques for synthesizing compound 1 were inefficient and time consuming, and thus expensive from the standpoint of production. The synthesis of the naphthyridine building block, for example, comprised nine separate steps and required the use of several expensive reagents, hampering the efficiency of the overall synthetic process. Similarly, the synthesis of the cyclopentene building block resulted in a high proportion of undesirable stereoisomers. Other aspects of the synthesis were likewise inefficient, expensive, and/or not amenable to commercial production. Previously synthesized hydrochloride salts of compound 1, moreover, displayed less than ideal solubility, handling (e.g., hydroscopicity) and other properties. Thus, there remains a need for an improved synthetic route to compound 1 that is amenable to large scale production formulation, storage and distribution. There also remains a need to develop improved salt forms of compound 1.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an efficient synthesis for the preparation of ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine and its succinate salt. The present invention additionally provides an efficient syntheses for the preparation of intermediates (3fl)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4//-pyran-4-one; (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid; and 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine; and for the preparation of the precursor (3S,4S)-N-((lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopent-2-en-l-yl)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-amine. The invention additionally resides in the superior properties of the succinate salt of ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{ [3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yljamine.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

tetrahydro-1,6-naphthyridine;<br>
(2)	treating the 6-{[(lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-isopropylcyclopent-<br>
2-en-l-yl]carbonyl}-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine with hydroxylamine to<br>
form (lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{ [3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l ,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl)cyclopent-2-en-l-amine; and<br>
(3)        coupling the (lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{ [3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopent-2-en-l-amine with (3R)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one via reductive amination.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine, 1(Figure Removed)comprising the further step of:<br>
(4)        hydrogenating (3S,4S)-N-((lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopent-2-en-l-yl)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-amine.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, discussed in greater detail below, the hydrogenation step is accomplished prior to the formation of compound 2.<br>
The syntheses of (3S,4S)-N-((lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{ [3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopent-2-en-l-yl)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-amine, 2, and ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine, 1, are depicted in Scheme 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)N-((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)-N-[(cis-3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine, 1, is synthesized by sequentially coupling three building block compounds 4, 5 and 6 (Schemes 3, 4 and 5, below). An amidation reaction between 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine, 5, and (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, 4, is carried out in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride to afford G-ffCl^^^^S-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-!-isopropylcyclopent-2-en-l-yl]carbonyl}-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine. Deprotection of the pyrrole group was carried out at this stage using hydroxylarnine as a through process to provide an amine salt. The amine salt and (3R)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one, 6, are coupled through reductive animation, in the presence of a tributylamine buffer, and with NaBH(OAc)3 to afford<br>
(3S,4S)-N-((lS,4S)-4-isopropyl-4-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopent-2-en-l-yl)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-amine, 2. The cyclopentene moiety of compound 2 was then hydrogenated to form free base compound 1.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-metlwxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine succinate, 3(Figure Removed)<br>
comprising the further step of:<br>
(5)        contacting ((lR,3S)-3-isopropyl-3-{ [3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]amine, 1 with succinic acid.<br>
Optionally, prior to step (5) compound 1 may be purified employing crystallization, either as a succinate salt or other salt such as a benzenesulfonate salt, followed by a salt break. Purification in this manner is described in the examples which follow.<br>
The synthesis of compound 3, the succinate salt, is depicted in Scheme 2:<br>
(Figure Removed)In another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of the intermediate (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, 4, comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	reacting (lR,4S)-4-aminocyclopenten-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid withMeOHin<br>
the presence thionyl chloride to form methyl (lR,4S)-4-aminocyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxyIate;<br>
(2)	reacting said methyl (lR,4S)-4-aminocyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate with<br>
acetylacetone to form methyl (lR,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)cyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate;<br>
(3)	reacting said methyl (lR,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)cyclopent-2-ene-l-<br>
carboxylate with 2-iodopropane to form methyl (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-<br>
isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate; and<br>
(4)	reacting said methyl (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-<br>
isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate with NaOH and MeOH to form (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid.<br>
The syntheses of (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid , 4, is depicted in Scheme 3(Figure Removed)Here, (lR,4S)-4-aminocyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid is converted into the corresponding methyl ester by treatment with thionyl chloride in methanol. Methyl (17?,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-l#-pyrrol-l-yl)cyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate is then synthesized by reacting the (lR,4S)-4-aminocyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate methyl ester with 2,4-pentanedione in the presence of DEEA. The following alkylation of methyl (l^,45)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-l//-pyrrol-l-yl)cyclopent-2-ene-l-carboxylate with iodopropane is carried out using lithium bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide as a base. The resulting alkylated product is then hydrolyzed to form the (lS,4S)-4-(2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-l-isopropylcyclopent-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid 4.<br>
While the above discussion assumes that the cyclopentene moiety will be hydrogenated in a later step to afford the cyclopentane, in fact many of the compounds depicted in Scheme 1 and 3 may be hydrogenated in an intervening step to produce a cyclopentane analog.   (Because a pyrrole protecting group, if present, would also be reduced to a pyrrolidine during this process, an alternate protecting group could be employed.)<br>
Moreover, in another feature of this aspect of the invention, intermediates may be synthesized having protecting groups other than 2,5-dimethyl-lH-pyrrol-l-yl. Thus, skilled chemists would pursue intermediate compounds of the general formula: (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein the protecting group "PG1" includes but is not limited to tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, benzoyl, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl, benzyl, triphenylmethyl, imines (such as diphenylmethylene) and other protecting groups known in the art, as exemplified in Greene, T; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY 1999.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation, of the intermediate 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine, 5, comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	reacting 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid with POC13, DMF, NaPF6 and a base to<br>
formN-[3-(dimethylaniino)-2-(trifluoromethyl)prop-2-enylidene]-N-methylmethanamium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (CF3DT);<br>
(2)	reacting CF3DT with the protected piperidone to form - N-(protecting group)-3-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine (for example, reacting CF3DT with BOC-<br>
piperidone to form - N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine);<br>
and<br>
(3)	reacting said - N-(protecting group)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-<br>
naphthyridinene (for example, N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-<br>
naphthyridine) in the presence of HCI and methanol to form - 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-<br>
naphthyridine.<br>
The syntheses of 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l,6-naphthyridine, 5, is depicted in Scheme 4A and 4B, below:<br>
(Figure Removed)Phosphorous oxychloride (POC13) is added to chilled DMF at a rate such that the<br>
temperature remained below 10 °C (approx. 1 h). The reaction mixture is warmed to RT and then 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid is added (exotherm to approx. 45 °C). The reaction mixture is warmed to 50°C and held at this temperature for approx 4 h. Upon completion of the vinamidinium formation the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to RT. The reaction mixture is then added concurrently with 5 N NaOH to a solution of NaPF6 in water cooled to 0°C.   The rates of addition of the two solutions are controlled such that the temperature of the aqueous slurry remains below 10 °C and the pH is between 3 and 4 (addition time takes about 2 h). Upon completion of the additions the resulting yellow slurry is aged for one hour at 0 °C then filtered to collect solids. The filtercake is slurry washed with ice cold water (2 times) and the cake dried with nitrogen/vacuum.   Typical yield 85 %.<br>
A solution of the protected piperidone, for instance the BOC protected piperidone, in THF is then added to a cooled (-20 °C) solution of lithium hexamethyldisilylamide (LiN(TMS)2) in THF, keeping the temperature below 10°C, to form the lithium enolate (approx 45 min). After warming to RT the enolate solution is transferred to a chilled (-20 °C) slurry of the CF3DT in THF at a rate such that the internal temperature remains below -10 °C (approx 45 min). This mixture is aged for 2 h at -20 °C then acetic acid is added and the mixture warmed to room temperature over 30 minutes. Ammonium acetate is then added and the mixture heated to 65 °C.   After two hours at 65 °C the reaction mixture is cooled to RT. Water and heptane are then added and the layers separated. The organic layer is washed with 2 M aqueous citric acid and then assayed for the BOC naphthyridine. Typical yield 65%.<br>
Next, the organic layer from the naphthyridine formation is concentrated and solvent switched to methanol. HC1 in DPA is then added and the mixture heated at 60 °C until the deprotection is complete (about 1 h). After cooling to room temperature water is added and the pH adjusted to appox 10.5. IP Ac is added and the layers separated. The aqueous layer is back extracted with EPAc two additional times. The combined organic layers are concentrated and solvent switched to IPA. This IPA solution is filtered to remove inorganic salts, the filtercake washed with IPA and the combined filtrate and washes reconcentrated to a total volume of about 5 mL/g. After the free base/IPA solution to 60 °C HC1 in EPA is added over 30 minutes. Solids are evident at about 50% addition. After completion of the HCI/IPA addition heptane is added to complete the crystallization and the slurry cooled to room temperature. The solids are isolated by filtration and washed with EPA/heptane (3 times 1 mL/g) then dried. Typical yield 75% from BOC naphthyridine.<br>
As noted above, piperidones having protecting groups ("PG2") other than tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl may also be used. Other protecting groups useful in the synthesis of the naphthiridine include, but are not limited to benzyloxycarbonyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, benzoyl, acetyl, formyl, trifluoroacetyl, 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl, N-benzyl, triphenylmethyl, and other protecting groups known in the art, as exemplified in Greene, T; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY 1999.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of the intermediate (3R)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one, 6, comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	reacting tetrahyro-4H-pyran-4-one with tripropylorthoformate and chlorobenzene<br>
to form 4-propoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-ethene;<br>
(2)	reacting said 4-propoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-ethene in the presence of acetone,<br>
water, hydroquinidine-l,4-phthalazinediyl diether (DHQD2PHAI), potassium osmate dehydrate, and 4-<br>
methylmorpholine N-oxide monohydrate (NMO) to form 3,4-dihydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-sulfonic<br>
acid, sodium salt;<br>
(3)	reacting said 3,4-dihydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-sulfonic acid, sodium salt<br>
with methanol and trimethylorthoformate in the presence of an acid to form 4,4-dimethoxytetrahydro-2H-<br>
pyran-3-ol; and<br>
(4)	reacting said 4,4-dimethoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ol in the presence of THF,<br>
NaOt-Bu, Me2SO4, and an acid to form (3R)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one.<br>
The syntheses of (3R)-3-methoxytetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one, 6, is depicted in the Scheme 5(Figure Removed)The starting pyranone is converted to its dipropyl ketal by treatment with<br>
tripropylorthoformate in the presence of an acid catalyst. The crude ketal is then heated in the presence of chlorobenzene. Under these conditions, elimination of propanol provides the propyl enol ether. The<br>
reaction is driven by the removal of propanol by distillation during the reaction sequence. The crude enol ether is then oxidized under modified Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation conditions. In this reaction N-methylmorpholine oxide is used as the stoichiometric oxidant. The reaction typically gives the product a-hydroxyketone in about 80 to 85 % ee. The a-hydroxyketone is not isolated directly but an aqueous solution of Na2S2O5 is added to form the bisulfite adduct of the ketone . From the acetone water mixture, racemic bisulfite adduct crystallizes. The racemate is removed by filtration and the resulting mother liquor is typically 95 to 99 % enantiomeric excess (ee). The acetone is removed in vacuo and isopropanol is added to give the crystalline bisulfite adduct with high enantiomeric excess. This is treated with HC1 and methanol with trimethylorthoformate as a water scavenger, to provide the dimethylketal. The hydroxyl group is then methylated using NaOt-Bu and Me2SO4. Adding water and HC1 to the reaction mixture provides the target cc-methoxypyranone in about 96% ee.<br>
Several abbreviations, acronyms and other shorthand is presented herein. Although these terms are known to those skilled in the art, presented below is a table summarizing these terms:(Figure Removed) ((lR,3S)-3-Isopropyl-3-{[3-(trinuoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro-l,6-naphthyridin-6(5H)-yl]carbonyl}cyclopentyl)[(3S,4S)-3-methoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]arnine<br>

(Figure Removed)The pyrrole cyclopentene acid (730 g, 90.4wt%, 2.67 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.93 L, 5.34 mol) were mixed in THF (6.6 L).
