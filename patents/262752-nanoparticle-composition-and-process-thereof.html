FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to nanoparticle composition comprising cellulose nanofibers embedded with nanosized material. More particularly the present invention relates to cellulose nanofibers embedded with silver or iron oxide embedded silver. In addition the present invention is also related to the preparation of the cellulose nanofibers embedded with nanosized material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Nanoparticles of silver, MgO, ZnO, Fe304, ZnS, CuO and Sn02 have assumed great importance in view of their application in biomedical and bio technology, pollution abatement, biosensor technology and as agents of antimicrobial therapy. Several ways and means have been pioneered in the recent past, particularly, towards the production of nanoparticles of various metals individually and in combination. Nanosilver is fascinating owing to its antimicrobial activity useful in the process of reducing microbial contamination in the field of food processing and hygiene control. In the production of nanoparticles use of less toxic or non-toxic chemicals has always been preferred in the form of reducing agents and stabilizers as chemically green procedures are preferred over conventional synthesis.<br>
Microorganisms cause mild to severe infections in human beings, animals and plants. Among the inorganic antimicrobial agents silver is a well known broad-spectrum agent employed most extensively since ancient times to fight infections caused by bacteria, yeast, fungi as well as virus. Nanosilver is known to inhibit or inactivate microorganisms effectively with lower toxicity to tissue. Due to the large surface area and high reactivity nanosilver is endowed with remarkable antimicrobial property. Because of long lasting biocidalaction nanosilver preparations are currently being used as antimicrobial agents in several industries such as ceramics, paper, plastic and packing films.<br>
Cellulose is a biopolymer mostly produced by plants and micro-organisms, however some marine animals were also shown to produce cellulose. Though wood is the major source of<br><br>
plant cellulose its separation and purification is a tedious process with the intervention of toxic chemical, hence, its large-scale application in pure form is impracticable. Bacterial cellulose produced by Acetobacter xylinum {Gluconacetobacter xylinus) is an attractive biomaterial with its intrinsic nanostructural hierarchy, its purity, mechanical strength and chemical robustness. This bacterium produces extracellular cellulose under static culture condition in the form of highly reticulated net like structure along with the entrapped bacteria, media components and protein. The whole complex is referred to as pellicle. The cellulose is purified using alkali treatment at boiling temperature. In the present investigation we have attempted to develop a novel antimicrobial composite material comprising of bacterial cellulose and nanosilver. Several researchers have reported the use of plant cellulose in the preparation of antibacterial silver formulations. We report the preparation of silver nanoparticles embedded into nanoparticulate bacterial cellulose as stabilizer for effective inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus. The process is simple and scalable for its real-time applications in various fields such as food packaging and in antimicrobial therapy.<br>

In this paper we report the synthesis and anti-bacterial activity of nanosilver stabilized with bacterial nanocellulose matrix. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were used to characterize the composite. The composite material had shown remarkable stability without aggregation of silver nanoparticles with the nanocellulose functioning as capping agent conformed using the FE-SEM. The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite was assessed against Staphyloccus aureus. The nanocomposite obtained through the use of hydrazine showed optimum growth inhibition against Staphyloccus aureus the ones prepared using sodium borohydride as reducing agent. The NaOH treated nanocellulose showed further enhancement in the antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite, which is rather attributed to its higher swelling characteristic, and retention of hydrogel property. It was also noticed that these composites not only inhibit the bacterial growth but also works as bactericidal at very low concentration of silver (110 |j.g ml"'). Due to its high antibacterial activity, and<br><br>
stabilizing effect of bacterial cellulose matrix, the nanocomposite appears to be promising for its application in biomedical technology, in antimicrobial textile and in food processing industry.<br>
On addition of silver nitrate to the aqueous cellulose fiber, the fibers are randomly distributed and swelled. Due to the presence of large number of terminal hydrophilic hydroxyl -OH groups on the membrane of the cellulose fibers, Ag"^ ions get easily deposited on the membrane and subsequently they can be reduced. The reduction of Ag^ in the cellulose silver nitrate aqueous mixture was performed by using a set of reducing agents as illustrated in Table 1.<br>
The use of water as a solvent in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles causes an immediate agglomeration due to the high polarity of water. In the synthesis of nanoparticles stabilizers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ethylene glycol, various other biopolymers and citrate have been reported. In the present study we employed bacterial cellulose in the form of a nanoparticulate gel. The cellulose was found to protect the nanosilver formed from aggregation or coalescence by steric hindrance. To optimize the concentration as well as the size of the silver nanoparticles, the concentration of Ag^ was kept at 1 mM, since higher concentration results in comparatively larger particles with lower antimicrobial efficacy. We have tested that the inhibition is due to the silver nanoparticles and not because of the presence of residual chemicals such as the by-products of reducing agents. In addition, high concentrations of silver would render toxicity to animal cells. High concentration of silver may also favor aggregation. The pH, which is also a paramount controlling parameter of the nanoparticles size as well as the antibacterial activity, is monitored and listed in Table 1. The synthesized cellulose nanocomposites were found to be stable at least over a period of 3 months in aqueous form at room temperature with no indication of aggregation or discoloration and with no detectable loss of silver nano particles.<br>
The formation of Ag nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-visible absorption spectra and Fe-SEM imaging. Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the silver loaded cellulose nanocomposite obtained by using hydrazine and sodium borohydride and the<br><br>
corresponding spectrum for the remaining reducing agents; glucose, ethylene glycol, tri-sodium citrate and hydroxyl ammonium hydrochloride are shown in Fig. 2. The bare cellulose does not show any absorption in the UV-visible region and the silver loaded composite shows a strong absorption in the UV-visible region due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of silver nanoparticles. The collective oscillation of free electrons in metallic nanoparticles known as SPR appears in the UV-visible region. The position and broadening of SPR depends on the shape, size, and stabilizing agent and on the dielectric constant of the medium. The absorption maximum of SPR observed is illustrated in Table 1. The observed SPR is red shifted in comparison to their corresponding sol (citrate or borohydride reduced sol) and is attributed to dipole resonance interactions between nanoparticles, a well known phenomena in noble metal nanoparticles.<br>
Fig. 3a, b and c show the FE-SEM images of the cellulose fibers and silver loaded fibers obtained by using hydrazine and sodium borohydride, respectively. The mean diameter of the particles is roughly 82 ± 34 and 100 + 14 nm for hydrazine and sodium borohydride reduced nanocomposite, respectively. The image display uniform network structure with the silver nanoparticles is observed to be distributed homogeneously on the cellulose surfaces as individual, nonaggregated particles. The images reveal that the particles are strongly adhered to the cellulose fibers. This adherence helps in stabilizing and in immobilizing the silver nanoparticles and thus preventing from agglomeration. The surface functional groups of cellulose fiber are the reason for the strong interaction of silver nanoparticles. This is one of the major advantages of the present protocol where other foreign chemicals, surfactant or polymer are not necessary to stabilize silver nanoparticles. The images also reveal that the cellulose fibers are not damaged during the synthesis. After obtaining the robust nanostructures their practical application in bacterial inhibition is examined. The antibacterial activity of nanosilver is mainly attributed to its affinity towards biologically important functional groups such as sulfhydryl amino, imidazole, carboxyl and phosphate groups, which exist mainly in protein such as enzymes. Nanosilver is also known to interact with DNA resulting in the formation of pyramidine dimers preventing its replication.<br><br>
The antibacterial activity of nanocomposite was considerably higher against the indicator pathogen Staphylococcus aureus as evidenced by the inhibitory zone (Fig. 4). The inhibition zone was around 2.6 cm radius in tryptic soya agar in the presence of NaOH treated cellulose. The nanocomposites prepared using non-swollen (no alkali treatment involved) was comparatively less inhibitory (2.0 cm radius). In addition the antibacterial effect of silver nanocomposite on stationary phase cells of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated using TEM (Fig. 5). Further the nanocomposite was shown to lyse the bacterial cells of stationary phase by way of perturbing the bacterial cell wall and consequent entry into the cell protoplasm causing leakage of cell contents and plasmolysis as seen in the TEM images (Fig. 5). The amount of silver in 50 i^l composite was calculated to be around 5.4 fag, which is considerably low and more over a remarkable inhibitory zone was shown in the study in comparison to the earlier investigations. We report the biocidal effect of silver nano-particles during growth and after cessation of growth of the pathogen. It was also found that washing of nano composite with distilled water deprive of its antibacterial activity to a great extent. Based on the data the nanocomposite will be a suitable antibacterial material for incorporation in to polymers to be made as films to control the growth of microorganisms in areas such as food processing textiles and other health care domains. The antibacterial activity of nano composite was remarkable against Staphylococcus aureus where as it was less inhibitory towards E. coli and S. typhi, when tested.<br>
From Table 1 it is evident that the antibacterial activity of the silver nanoparticles is in congruence with the SPR of the composites. The nanoparticles with SPR at the blue end have shown a better antibacterial activity than those with red SPR. The size of the silver nanoparticles showed a linear relationship with SPR and hence smaller particles with larger surface area were found to show better interaction with bacterial surface and thereby bactericidal effect.<br>
Iron oxide embedded silver nanoparticles have the magnetic characteristics of iron oxide and the surface properties of silver nanoparticles. This is a major advantage, since separation of the particle under the influence of magnetic field is possible. Most of these<br><br>
nanoparticles when formed in a solution are capped by an organic layer and same is the case of the iron oxide nanoparticles as well as iron oxide embedded silver nano particles (see Fig. 6). These nanoparticles show their characteristic UV visible spectra as shown in Fig. 7. Due to the presence of a strong capping agent the surface effects of silver are not similar to pristine silver surface. In the case of nanocomposites of cellulose nano fibers and iron oxide embedded silver nanoparticles, the capping agent is the cellulose nano fibers itself. Since the cellulose fibers do not form a complete cover on silver surface, the silver surface behaves more like pristine silver surface. The cellulose nano fiber also releases the nanoparticles in a controlled fashion into the solution. This is true in the case of nanocomposites of cellulose nano fibers and silver nanoparticles. The antibacterial effects of composite of cellulose nano fiber with iron oxide embedded silver nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 8 and is comparable to the pure silver case shown in Fig. 4. The magnetic property of iron oxide embedded silver nanoparticle could be used to remove these nanoparticles from its environment, where it could probably have toxic effects of silver, by applying an external magnetic field.<br>
As a control experiment to show that the reducing agents like hydrazine and sodium borohydrate as well as the cellulose nano fibers do not show any antibacterial activity, we have tested the mixture of these in an antibacterial test culture and the results are displayed in Fig. 9. It is clear that these do not have any effect on the bacterial growth and their presence in the composite will not infiuence the observed results.<br>
In conclusion a silver nanocomposite comprising of nanoparticulate bacterial cellulose and nanosilver was prepared in aqueous phase. The stabilization of the nanoparticles was achieved by the presence of water-dispersed cellulose particles in the reaction medium. The antibacterial activity had matched to a very larger extent with SPR. The optimal antibacterial activity was noticed in the composite which was prepared using hydrazine as reductant. The nanocomposite had inhibited the 5. aureus during the growth process and bacterial cells in their stationery phase. The composite materials and the route of synthesis appear to be suitable for application in the preparation of antimicrobial food packaging films, water purification systems, medical dressings, inner textiles. Modifications need to be carried out to incorporate the nanocomposite into polymeric films for their optimum<br><br>
utilization.   The   utility   of the   material   can  be   widened  by   exploring  additional fictionalization.<br>

Millipore water was used for all washing procedures as well as solutions preparation.<br>
Silver nanoparticles loading on cellulose fibers: In order to synthesize cellulose fibers silver nanocomposites we have used a range of reducing agents hydrazanium hydroxide, sodium borohydride, hydroxyl ammonium hydrochloride, tri-sodium citrate, D-glucose and ethylene glycol to reduce Ag* to silver nanoparticles. Weighed quantities of cellulose sample ~1 % (w/w) is dispersed in ImM aqueous silver nitrate solution in a beaker and sonicated for half an hour. Aqueous solution of the reducing agents ~ 2-5 mM are added drop wise to the cellulose solution. The reactions are carried out at room temperature except in the case of sodium borohydride where ice-cold condition is maintained and in case of D-glucose, tri-sodium citrate and ethylene glycol, the solution is refluxed for an hour. In case of hydroxyl ammonium hydrochloride as reducing agent, 1 mM alkalinity is maintained by adding aqueous NaOH solution.<br>
Silver nanoparticles loading on cellulose papers: In order to load silver nanoparticles on cellulose papers, the paper is soaked in ImM aqueous silver nitrate solution for half an hour, washed with ethanol and water again soaked in ImM aqueous solutions of reducing agent (hydrazinium hydroxide or sodium borohydride) for half an hour. Finally they were washed with ethanol and water and dried in air at room temperature (-22 °C).<br>
Measurements: Uv-vis absorption measurements were done by using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UVA^IS/NIR spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed using JEOL 3010 with an operating voltage of 300 keV. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) was done by using a Nova 600 NanoSEM (FEI, Germany). The composition mainly carbon, oxygen and silver of silver<br><br>
loaded cellulose were determined by using EDAX equipped to the FE-SEM. The pH measurements were done by using a Eutech p" 510. All the measurements were performed at room temperature (~22 °C).<br>
Assay for antibacterial activity of silver nanocomposite: The antibacterial activity of silver-cellulose nanocomposite was tested using Staphylococcus aureus. A fresh culture of the bacterium was prepared by inoculating a loop of inoculum into 50 ml of nutrient broth and BHI broth. The organism was monitored as 25% glycerol store in broth and was stored at 85 °C. After incubating the culture at 37 °C for 15-20 hrs, serial dilution in the range 10"' - lO'^ was made in 2 ml eppendorf tubes with sterile distilled water. Tryptic soy agar plates were prepared by adding 7.5g of tryptic soy broth medium and 0.2g of agar in 250ml of distilled water. After autoclaving at 20 psi for 15 minutes the mo Iter was pored into disposal petriplates at the rate of 15 ml / dish. After solidification of the medium under aseptfic conditions 100 i^l of 10' dilution Staphylococcus aureus culture was spreaded into each plate with a glass spreader. Wells were made with the help of a 7 mm cylindrical metal pipe. At the center of the well 50 |il of silver nanocomposite in solution form was placed. The petridishes were kept at 5 °C ± 2 in refrigerator for 2.0 - 2.5 hours. The plates were finally kept 37 °C for 20-24 hours in a BOD incubator. The zone and inhibition is reported as radius from the centre of the well under observation. Preparation of Fe304 core and Ag shell Nanoparticles:<br>
Materials: All the chemicals AgNOs (Qualigens, 99.8%), N2H5OH (Merck, ~ 100%), FeCl2.4H20 (NP Chem), anhydrous FeCls (Qualigens, 96.0%), HCl (Laboratory Rasayan, 35-38%), NaOH (Merck, 97%), HNO3 (Laboratory Rasayan, 69-72 %), 2-Napthalenethiol (Aldrich, 99%), Rhodamine 6G (SD fine chemicals, India, 95%) and Rhodamine B (SD fine chemicals, India, 80%) were used without further purification. Millipore water was used to make the solutions.<br>
Synthesis: The synthesis of y - Fe^O^ nanoparticles is done following the procedures described in literature. In a typical synthetic method 25 ml. of aqueous solution containing 0.4 M Fe^^, 0.8 M Fe^^ and 0.4 M HCl is added drop wise to a moderately heated (-50 °C) 250 ml of aqueous 1.5 M NaOH solution under vigorous non-magnetic stirring. A black<br><br>
precipitate of Fe^O^ is formed immediately. After 15 minutes of stirring the precipitates<br>
are allowed to settle down, washed with water and magnetically separated. The precipitates are centrifuged at 6000 rpm and then washed twice with water and redispersed in 500 ml water.<br>
By using hydrazinium hydroxide as reducing agent to coat Ag on Fe^O^. 2 ml (containing 0.12 mmol of Fe) of stock solution of ^£304 is dispersed in 8 ml of water. 1 % aqueous<br>
solution of AgNOs is added to the solution to make appropriate concentration of Ag^ in the solutions. Five set of concentrations, lO'"*, 5 x 10"'*, 10"*, 5 x 10'^ and 10"^ M each for Ag"^ was done. After 15 minutes 0.2 M aqueous solution of hydrazinium hydroxide is added drop wise with constant shaking. The final concentration of hydrazinium hydroxide is maintained two times higher than Ag^. The solution turns to yellowish green for Ag. The particles are separated by using a magnet and washed 2-3 times with distilled water and finally they were dried under vacuum at room temperature for further characterization. Fe304 core and silver shell (core-shell) nanoparticles loading on cellulose flbers: In order to synthesize cellulose fibers core-shell nanocomposites we have mixed the nanoparticles of Fe^O^'with cellulose fibers and reduced the silver on to the iron oxide nanoparticles as described in the earlier section.<br>
Measurements: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded by using JEOL 3010 with an operating voltage of 300 keV. Uv-Vis absorption measurements were done by using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UVA^IS/NIR spectrophotometer. The molar ratios of Fe to Ag were determined by ED AX measurements. Magnetization measurements were performed using a VSM in PPMS (Physical property measurement system) with magnetic fields up to 20 kOe at 298.15 K.<br>
Assay for antibacterial activity of silver nanocomposite: The antibacterial activity of core-shell-cellulose nanocomposite was tested using Staphylococcus aureus. A fresh culture of the bacterivim was prepared by inoculating a loop of inoculum into 50 ml of nutrient broth and BHI broth. The organism was monitored as 25% glycerol store in broth<br><br>
and was stored at 85 °C. After incubating the culture at 37 °C for 15-20 hrs, serial dilution in the range 10"' - 10  was made in 2 ml eppendorf tubes with sterile distilled water. Tryptic soy agar plates were prepared by adding 7.5g of tryptic soy broth medium and 0.2g of agar in 250ml of distilled water. After autoclaving at 20 psi for 15 minutes the molter was poured into disposal petriplates at the rate of 15 ml / dish. After solidification of the medium under aseptic conditions 100 ^il of 10"^ dilution Staphylococcus aureus culture was spreaded into each plate with a glass spreader. Wells were made with the help of a 7 mm cylindrical metal pipe. At the center of the well 50  of silver nanocomposite in solution form was placed. The petridishes were kept at 5 °C ± 2 in refrigerator for 2.0 - 2.5 hours. The plates were finally kept 37 °C for 20-24 hours in a BOD incubator. The zone and inhibition is reported as radius from the centre of the well under observation.<br><br><br><br>
