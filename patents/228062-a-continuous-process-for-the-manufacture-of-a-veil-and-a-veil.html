				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a fiber veil in<br>
which the binder is derived from polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) fibers. The veil<br>
manufactured according to the invention can be used especially as a wall covering.<br>
For this application it can be stuck to the walls on one side with a water-based<br>
adhesive and receive a paint (based on water or an organic solvent) on the other<br>
side.<br>
"Veil" is understood as meaning a nonwoven consisting of completely<br>
dispersed filaments. In general, a veil has a weight per unit area ranging from 10<br>
to 60 g/m2 and more particularly 20 to 40 g/m2, for example about 30 g/m2.<br>
The continuous manufacture of a veil involves passing a bed of dispersed<br>
filaments through several successive devices, each of which has to apply a specific<br>
treatment to said filaments. After it has been formed in a "forming device", the<br>
bed of fibers then passes through a "binder application device" followed by a<br>
"stoving device". The bed is conveyed through these devices by means of<br>
conveyor belts and is generally transferred from one belt to another. As it passes<br>
from one device to another by "belt hopping", the veil being formed tends to lose<br>
its cohesion, resulting in structural defects, such as a non-uniform weight, in the<br>
final veil.<br>
The continuous process according to the invention comprises:<br>
- a step in which chopped filaments and discontinuous PVOH fibers are<br>
dispersed in a process water, followed by<br>
- a step in which a bed is formed in a forming device by passing the<br>
dispersion over a forming cloth through which the process water is drained,<br>
the filaments and fibers being retained on said cloth, followed by<br>
- a heat treatment step in a stoving device.<br>
The invention overcomes the problems mentioned above. In fact, as the<br>
PVOH fiber introduced at the start acts as a binder for the veil, it is not absolutely<br>
necessary to use a binder application device, which means that the veil has to<br>
undergo fewer "belt hops". Also, the Applicant discovered that the PVOH fibers<br>
gave rigidity to the bed being formed, probably due to the fact that the PVOH fiber<br>
imparts adhesiveness to the various ingredients of the bed and holds them together.<br>
The bed is thus damaged less during belt hopping.<br>
To be dispersed in water, the filaments have to be able to remain in the<br>
individual state and not group together when mixed in the process water. If<br>
chopped yarns, an assembly of filaments, are dispersed in water, these yarns must<br>
be able to separate into filaments when dispersed in the water. "Yarn" is<br>
understood as meaning an assembly of contiguous filaments comprising more<br>
particularly from 10 to 2000 filaments. Thus the filaments, more particularly glass<br>
filaments, can be introduced into the process water in the form of yarns comprising<br>
more particularly 10 to 2000 filaments.<br>
The filaments which can be used within the framework of the present<br>
invention generally comprise glass filaments and are more particularly glass<br>
filaments that are capable of being used for dispersion in the form of chopped<br>
yarns. The filaments may have been sized during manufacture, if appropriate so as<br>
to be assembled into yarns, especially with sizing liquids comprising an<br>
organosilane and/or a film former. It is preferable in this case not to dry the<br>
filaments before dispersing them in water, so as to avoid sticking the filaments<br>
together, which would hinder their dispersion as individual filaments.<br>
Chopped filaments which can be used in addition to glass filaments are<br>
cellulose fibers (or "cellulose filaments", to use a synonym) and/or polyester<br>
filaments, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) filaments.<br>
The cellulose fibers are generally obtained from wood pulp. This wood<br>
pulp is generally obtained from commercial sheets of cardboard, which are<br>
softened with water. This water used to soften the cardboard then serves to convey<br>
the pulp towards the plant where the dispersion is prepared. This water/pulp<br>
mixture generally contains just enough water to be able to convey the pulp by<br>
flowing. Before reaching the dispersion medium, this pulp/water mixture<br>
generally contains from 70 to 99% by weight of water and 1 to 30% by weight of<br>
cellulose. In general, the polyester filaments are chopped and have a length<br>
ranging from 3 to 25 mm and a diameter ranging from 7 to 20 urn. The polyester<br>
filaments marketed under the reference EP133 by Kuraray may be mentioned as<br>
polyester filaments which can be used.<br>
A glass filament/cellulose fiber mixture is used more particularly as<br>
chopped filaments within the framework of the present invention when a good tear<br>
strength is sought.<br>
A glass filament/polyester filament mixture is used more particularly as<br>
chopped filaments within the framework of the present invention when a good tear<br>
strength and an improved appearance of the veil are sought. In fact, polyester<br>
filaments give the veil a more uniform appearance.<br>
The PVOH fibers are discontinuous and generally have a length ranging<br>
from 3 to 15 mm and a diameter ranging from 7 to 20 µm.<br>
In the first step, the chopped filaments and PVOH fibers are dispersed in<br>
water, for example in a pulper. The aqueous solution in which the chopped<br>
filaments and PVOH fibers are dispersed is called process water. This dispersion<br>
can initially be prepared in a pulper, for example with a proportion of filaments<br>
and fibers such that the total weight of filaments + fibers ranges from 0.01% to<br>
0.5% of the total weight of filaments, fibers and process water.<br>
Preferably, at the moment when it enters the bed forming step, the<br>
filament/fiber/process water mixture is such that the total weight of filaments +<br>
fibers represents 0.01 to 0.5%, and preferably 0.02 to 0.05%, of the weight of said<br>
mixture. The concentration of filaments + fibers in the mixture may decrease as it<br>
passes from the pulper to the bed forming device.<br>
The weight of PVOH fibers used represents preferably 1.5 to 20%, and<br>
particularly preferably 2.5 to 15%, of the total weight of chopped filaments and<br>
PVOH fibers.<br>
It is possible to use only glass filaments as the chopped filaments.<br>
Other chopped filaments which can be used are a mixture of glass filaments<br>
and cellulose fibers, especially in a glass/cellulose weight ratio of 99/1 to 80/20,<br>
and preferably of 95/5 to 90/10, it being understood that the weight of glass<br>
filaments takes account of any size they may contain.<br>
Other chopped filaments which can be used are a mixture of glass filaments<br>
and polyester filaments, especially in a glass/polyester weight ratio of 99/1 to<br>
70/30, and preferably of 90/10 to 80/20. The process water can comprise a<br>
thickener to increase its viscosity. This thickener can be present in the process<br>
water in an amount of 0 to 0.5% by weight, a possible example of said thickener<br>
being a hydroxyethyl cellulose (e.g. Natrosol 250HHR from Hercules).<br>
The process water can comprise a cationic dispersant. This cationic<br>
dispersant can be present in the process water in an amount of 0 to 0.1% by weight.<br>
A possible example of said cationic dispersant is guanidine or an amine with a<br>
fatty chain. Aerosol C 61, marketed by CYTEC, can be used in particular.<br>
The thickener is preferably introduced so that the process water has a<br>
viscosity of between 1 and 20 mPa.s, and preferably of between 5 and 12 mPa.s, at<br>
20°C.<br>
The process water/chopped filament dispersion is agitated and then<br>
transferred to a permeable forming cloth (which can also be called a belt) that lets<br>
the process water flow through it and retains the chopped filaments and PVOH<br>
fibers on its surface. The removal of the process water can be improved by<br>
suction. The process water can be recycled and mixed again with chopped<br>
filaments and PVOH fibers. The mixture of chopped filaments and PVOH fibers<br>
thus forms a bed on the surface of the forming cloth.<br>
The forming cloth is a conveyor belt, i.e. a moving belt, that conveys the<br>
bed towards the stoving device.<br>
It is not necessary to pass the formed bed through a binder application<br>
device insofar as the PVOH fiber used at the start serves as the binder for the final<br>
veil. However, it is not excluded to use a smaller amount of binder in the form of<br>
fibers introduced at the start, and to make up by adding binder in a binder<br>
application device located downstream from the bed forming device. It is<br>
therefore possible to incorporate 25 to 100% of the total weight of binder in the<br>
form of PVOH fibers introduced at the start, the remainder being applied in the<br>
binder application device.<br>
The final veil comprises generally 1.5 to 15% by weight of binder (which<br>
can be exclusively PVOH) and more generally 2.5 to 10% by weight of binder<br>
(which can be exclusively PVOH), the remaining weight of the veil generally<br>
consisting of the weight of the filaments, including any sizing products which coat<br>
them. The veil according to the invention is generally based on glass filaments,<br>
i.e. it generally comprises at least 55% by weight of glass in the form of filaments.<br>
Thus the veil can comprise at least 80% by weight of glass in the form of<br>
filaments, especially in cases where only glass filaments have been used as the<br>
chopped filaments.<br>
If the final veil comprises both glass filaments and cellulose fibers, these<br>
two types of component remain present in the final veil in the proportions in which<br>
they were introduced, as already stated.<br>
If the final veil comprises both glass filaments and polyester filaments,<br>
these two types of component remain present in the final veil in the proportions in<br>
which they were introduced, as already stated. If it is chosen to apply part of the<br>
total binder in the binder application device, this is generally applied in the form of<br>
an aqueous dispersion:<br>
- either by soaking between two forming cloths, in which case the product<br>
held between the two cloths is immersed in a bath via pairs of rollers,<br>
or by deposition on the bed of chopped filaments by means of a cascade,<br>
meaning that the aqueous dispersion of binder is run onto the sheet of<br>
chopped filaments in a stream perpendicular to said sheet and<br>
perpendicular to the direction of travel of said sheet.<br>
The binder can be of the type normally used in this kind of process. In<br>
particular, it can be plasticized polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), styrene-acrylic, self-<br>
crosslinking acrylic, urea-formaldehyde or melamine-formaldehyde. The excess<br>
binder can be sucked away through the forming cloth.<br>
The bed must enter the stoving device moist (between 20 and 70% by<br>
weight of water, for example about 40% by weight of water) so as to enable the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol fiber to dissolve in the water. This dissolution takes place under<br>
the effect of temperature, generally above about 60°C, the PVOH fiber converting<br>
to droplets of binder.<br>
The purpose of the heat treatment step is to evaporate the water and effect<br>
any chemical reactions between the various constituents, for example condensation<br>
reactions of -OH groups. The heat treatment can be carried out by heating to<br>
between 140 and 250°C. The duration of the heat treatment generally ranges from<br>
2 seconds to 3 minutes. The veil can be dried and heat-treated in an oven with hot<br>
air circulating through the belt. After the heat treatment, essentially all the PVOH<br>
fibers have been converted to PVOH binder and no longer appear in the form of<br>
fibers.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows a continuous process for the preparation<br>
of a veil according to the invention. The chopped filaments and the PVOH fiber<br>
are dispersed in a pulper 1 in the presence of process water, with agitation. The<br>
mixture may then be discharged into a storage tank 2 through the pipe 3, the<br>
purpose of the storage tank being to increase the mixing time of the filaments and<br>
the process water. This storage tank is optional. The mixture is then led through<br>
the pipe 4 to the pipe 5, which combines the flow of mixture coming from the pipe<br>
4 with a flow of recycled process water coming from the headbox 6 through the<br>
pipe 7. At this point the proportion of filaments and fibers in the<br>
filament/fiber/process water mixture is greatly reduced. Process water is drained<br>
at 14 and optionally sucked at 15 through the forming cloth 8, and is recycled via<br>
the pipe 17. This recycled water is then divided at 16 so that e.g. about 10%<br>
returns to the pulper through the pipe 10 and about 90% returns to the headbox 6<br>
through the pipes 9, 7 and then 5. Circulation in the pipes is assured by the pumps<br>
11, 12 and 13. The pump 11 is called the fan pump. The veil being formed, 18,<br>
then undergoes a "belt hop" to the stoving device 19, and the final veil is rolled up<br>
at 20.<br>
The invention provides a veil with a very high tensile strength for low<br>
proportions of binder, especially such that the following equation is satisfied:<br>
RT/ (L . G) &gt; 0.03, or even &gt; 0.035,<br>
in which Rt is the tensile strength in daN per 5 cm, L is the proportion of binder in<br>
the veil in % by weight and G is the weight of the veil in g/m2. Rt is determined<br>
by taking the mean of the two values obtained for the cross direction and the<br>
machine direction.<br>
By way of comparison, for an identical proportion of binder, the tensile<br>
strengths of the veil according to the invention are twice those of a conventional<br>
veil bound by a urea-formaldehyde of very good specification (cf. the Examples in<br>
particular).<br>
The veil according to the invention is more particularly intended for wall<br>
coverings. For this type of application it is not desirable for the veil to contain<br>
resin of the PVC type. The veil according to the invention is therefore generally<br>
such that it does not contain PVC.<br>
In the Examples the tensile strength was measured according to Standard<br>
ISO 3342.<br>
Examples 1 to 3:<br>
Glass yarns chopped to a length of 18 mm are used, said yarns containing<br>
filaments of diameter 13 µm, said filaments being coated with a size comprising an<br>
organosilane and having a moisture content of 13% by weight. These yarns are<br>
used in the process of Figure 1. The chopped glass yarns are introduced into the<br>
pulper so that their concentration in said pulper is 1.95 (Example 1), 1.9 (Example<br>
2) and 1.8 (Example 3) grams per liter. PVOH fibers chopped to 4 mm (of mark<br>
Kuralon 105-2 marketed by Kuraray) are also introduced into the pulper so that<br>
their concentration in said pulper is 0.05 (Example 1), 0.1 (Example 2) and 0.2<br>
(Example 3) grams per liter. The concentration of glass yarns is then diluted by a<br>
factor of 10 and the concentration of filaments + fibers on arrival at the forming<br>
cloth was 0.2 g/l. The concentration of PVOH fibers on arrival at the forming<br>
cloth was 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02 g/l respectively. The forming cloth traveled at a<br>
speed of 80 m/min and the flow rate of glass yarn/PVOH fiber/process water<br>
mixture discharging onto the cloth was 35 m3/hour. The process water contained<br>
0.1% by weight of hydroxyethyl cellulose (Natrosol 250HHR from Hercules) and<br>
0.025% by weight of a cationic dispersant (aerosol C61 from Cytec). After<br>
drainage and suction of the excess water, the moist sheet contains 35% of water.<br>
The sheet is then dried in a hot-air oven at 180°C for 20 seconds. The veil<br>
obtained is very homogeneous and has a weight per unit area of 50 g/m2. It<br>
contains the amounts of PVOH indicated in Table 1, where the results are collated.<br>
Examples 4 to 9 (comparative):<br>
The procedure is as for Example 1 except that no PVOH fiber is introduced into<br>
the pulper, and except that a binder is added, downstream from the forming cloth<br>
and before drying, by discharging a cascade of a solution of PVOH or urea-<br>
formaldehyde onto the traveling sheet. The veils obtained all have a weight per<br>
unit area of 50 g/m2. The results are collated in Table 1.<br>
