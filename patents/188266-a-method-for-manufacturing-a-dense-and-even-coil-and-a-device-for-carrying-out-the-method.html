				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a dense and even coil and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for winding up round material on a drum provided with terminal flanges with the aid of an arrangement for rotating and axially displacing the drum and furthermore an axially traversed presser device in engagement with the periphery of the drum. The method in accordance with the invention and the device are in this respect particularly suitable for thick round material which is relatively hard to bend such as thick round wire or cable, although they are in principle suitable for thinner materials.<br>
When winding up round material it is important for the material to be so laid that a dense and even coil is produced with an optimum degree of packing as a pre-condition for kink-free winding and satisfactory unwinding of the round material. This can only be achieved if the round material is wound in turns which are close together and are accurately positioned in the channels between the turns of the underlying layer.<br>
Know equipment with a reciprocating traverse which only guides the round material to follow the course of winding, fail to offer any guarantee that on changing from one layer to the next layer there is no cocking of the round material and that the material is reliably positioned in the channel between turns of the preceding layer.<br>
One object of the invention is to provided means which ensure a reliable and accurate winding up of round material, more particularly such material with a large diameter.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
This object is to be attained by the means recited in claim 1. An apparatus suitable to attaining the object of the invention is recited in claim 3. Advantageous further developments of the invention are claimed in claims 2 and 4 through 9.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for manufacturing a dense and even coil characterized by the following steps :-<br>
i)	attachment of the round material adjacent to a flange of the drum;<br>
ii) placement of the presser device laterally against the round material (8);<br>
iii) rotation of the winding drum without axial displacement thereof and<br>
traversing of the presser device towards the oppositely arranged flange by<br>
an amount equal to the diameter of the round material per rotation of the<br>
winding drum; iv) interruption of the axial traverse of the pressure device at a<br>
 predetermined angle between the supplied round material and the axis of<br>
the winding drum and displacement of the winding drum towards the<br>
last produced winding turns by an amount exceeding the diameter of the<br>
round material per rotation of the winding drum; v) repetition of the steps iii) and iv) until the clearance distance of the<br>
presser device from the other flange of the winding drum is equal to 1.5<br>
times the diameter of the round material; vi) axial displacement of the winding drum and of the pressure device<br>
towards the wound turn by an amount equal to the diameter of the<br>
round material; vii) increasing the speed of displacement of the winding drum and of the<br>
presser device, when the winding has reached the flange of the drum,<br>
until the supplied round material is at a right angle to the axis of the<br>
winding drum;<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
viii) arresting the displacement of the winding drum and of the presser device during one rotation of the winding drum, in which the round material is wound between the flange of the winding drum and the presser device for one turn of the first layer and is wound into the channel between the last and the penultimate turns of the first layer; and<br>
ix) repetition of the steps iii) through viii) with an opposite direction of displacement for winding the next layer.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided a device for carrying out the method, said device comprising a drive device (2) for rotation of the winding drum in the direction of winding up, characterized by a further drive for displacement of the winding drum (3) in both directions and by a presser device (5), which is thrust radially and resiliently against the periphery of the winding drum or, respectively, against the already wound round material (8) and is able to be shifted by a traverse (4) axially for lateral engagement on the supplied round material.<br>
The invention will be understood from the following detailed descriptive disclosure of on embodiment thereof in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective elevation of the main parts of the<br>
 4<br><br>
apparatus in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figure 2a and<br>
Figure 2b diagrammatically show the<br>
course of the winding op-eration,<br>
The winding apparatus consists essentially of a wind motor 2 moved by positioning device 1 and which, possibly by the intermediary of a transmis-sion, serves to accept the winding drum 3. In the direction of rotation following the point of contact of the round material on the drum there is a presser roll 5 making resilient contact on the periphery of the round material. The means for holding the roller 5 is designed 1n the form of a traverse 4, by means of which the roller 5 is shifted in a direction parallel to the axis of the drum 3. The roller has the form of a circular disk and has its periphery in engagement with the winding drum 3 or respectively the lowermost layer of the round material with one of its lateral surfaces laterally engaging the wound round material.<br>
The round, material 6 to be wound is fed from a supply by way of a stationary pulley wheel 6. Between the pulley wheel 6 and the winding drum 3 two sensors underneath the arriving round material are arranged, which supply a signal to a computing and control unit, when, owing to deflection to the side, the round material is located over one of the sensors.<br>
The Winding operation is represented diagrammatically in figures 2a and 2b in consecutive phases. The lower part of the figure in this respect shows a plan view of the supplied round material, whereas the upper part shows a view perpendicular thereto oppositely to the direction of the sup-plied round material. The axial traversing motion of the winding drum 3 and of the presser roller 5 are here indicated by arrows. In the initial situation the drum 1s in the position (1), in which the round material coming from the pulley wheel 6 is being trained at a right angle to the axis of the drum without any clearance between it and the surface of the winding drum flange and can be secured in a hole drilled therefor in the flange of the drum. The presser roller 5 is traversed axially as far as a distance between it and the drum flange equal to the diameter of the round material, where it is thrust radially against the core of the drum. Then the rotary drive of the winding drum is switched on and the winding operation is commenced.<br>
In the position (2) at the start of winding the presser roller 5 is traversed following the turns already laid through a stroke for each rotation of the drum which corresponds to the diameter of the round material.<br>
5<br>
The winding drum is during this time held axially fixed. As an alternative to this it may however shifted in a direction opposite to that of the movement of the presser roller, but with a lower speed than the presser roller. The speed of shifting must in this case be so set that the sum of the displacements of the winding drum and of the presser roller per rotation of the drum be equal to the diameter of the round material.<br>
Owing to the adaptation of the shift of the presser roller and/or the winding drum to the diameter of the round material for the material being fed only a distance is made available which is equal to the diameter of the material with the result that the turns are produced in tight lateral engagement with one another and without any lateral intermediate clearance.<br>
Owing to the fact that the winding drum is stationary or is shifted more slowly in accordance with the supply, the angle, which was originally a right angle, between the axis of the drum and the round material coming from the pulley wheel 6 changes. In the position (3) the angle will have attained a value, at which the sensor illustrated in the figure to the left<br>
responds . The signal from the sensor ensures that the displacement of the<br>
presser roller is interrupted and the shifting drive of the winding drum is put into operation in a direction opposite to that of the displacement of the presser roller (to the right in the lower views). The speed of displacement is in this case larger than one material breadth per rotation of the drum. When in the position (2) the displacement of the winding drum is taking place more slowly the speed is correspondingly increased in the position (3).<br>
Owing to the more rapid displacement of the winding drum the change In angle is offset and the sensor is put out of operation. Accordingly the displacement of the presser roller is resumed again and that of the winding drum 1s arrested (or slowed down). This operation is repeated so many times that the distance between the presser roller and the other drum flange is equal to 1.5 times diameter of the material.<br>
At this point in time indicated in position (4) the direction of displacement of the presser roller is reversed and it is moved in the same direction as the winding drum at a speed corresponding to the thickness of the material per rotation of the drum. The consequence of this is that the distance between the pressser roller and the drum flange is kept constant, without making however any space available for the material supplied to the drum to the side of the presser roller. Accordingly the material is pressed under the presser roller or, respectively, lifted by the material and the following turns are wound underneath the presser roller (position 5).<br>
6<br><br>
In the position (6) the material underneath the presser roller has reached the other drum flange. The displacement in the same direction of the winding drum and of the presser roller is now increased and maintained<br>
at a higher rate until the material coming from the pulley wheel 6 runs at a right angle to the axis of the winding drum. Then the displacement of<br>
the winding drum 1s stopped and the displacement of the presser roller is arrested for one revolution of the winding drum. Accordingly the material is wound over the already existing turn of the first layer and, owing to the spacing of the presser roller by 1.5 times the diameter of the material from the winding drum flange, is laid in the channel between the last and the penultimate turns of the first layer.<br>
After this in the position (7) the traverse 4 for the. presser roller is switched on again and the winding of the second layer is commenced. In the position (8) the movement out of position of the material means that the other sensor is activated, which causes a displacement of the winding drum or, respectively, an increase in the traverse speed to the left.<br>
Winding is continued in this manner in alternating lateral directions.<br>
