COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CONTAINER"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
26-07-2005<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a container from a branched polycarbonate.<br>
Containers of polycarbonate are known<br>
Containers of polycarbonate exhibit numerous advantageous properties such as for example elevated transparency, good mechanical properties, elevated resistance to environmental influences and a long service life together with low weight and straightforward, low-cost producibility.<br>
Polycarbonate containers are produced for example, using the extrusion blow moulding process or the injection blow moulding process.<br>
In the extrusion blow moulding process, the pellets are generally melted with a single screw extruder and are shaped by a die to form a free¬standing tube, which is subsequently enclosed by a blowing mould, which pinches together the bottom of the tube. The tube is inflated within the mould, thus being shaped as desired. After a cooling period, the mould is opened and the hollow article may be removed (a more detailed description may be found, for example, in Brinkschroder, F.J. Polycarbonate in Becker, Braun Kunstsoff-Handbuch, volume 3/1, Polycarbonate, Polyacetale, Polyester, Celluloseester, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, Vienna 1992, pages 257 to 264).<br>
It is advantageous to use a highly pseudoplastic polycarbonate for extrusion blow moulding in order to ensure elevated melt stability. Branched polycarbonates are particularly pseudoplastic.<br>
The injection blow moulding process is a combination of injection moulding and blow moulding.<br>
-2-<br><br><br>
The process proceeds in three stages<br>
1)	injection moulding of the parison in the plastic temperature range of the polycarbonate<br>
2)	inflation of the parison in the thermoplastic range of the polycarbonate (the core of the injection moulding tool is simultaneously the blowing mandrel)<br>
3)	stripping of the hollow article and, optionally, cooling of the blowing mandrel with air<br>
(a more detailed description may be found, for example, in Anders, S., Kaminski, A., Kappenstein, R., Polycarbonate in Becker, Braun, Kunststoff-Handbuch, volume 3/1, Polycarbonate, Polydcetale, Polyester, Celluloseester, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, Vienna 1992, pages 223 to 225).<br>
Known containers of polycarbonate exhibit the disadvantage that they do not meet certain requirements for practical use. If known containers of polycarbonate are subjected to severe mechanical stress, the container may burst. This may occur, for example, if a liquid-filled container is dropped from some height onto the ground, for example from the loading area of a truck in which the container is being transported. Such mechanical loads may, for example, be simulated by the drop test as is described in the present text.<br><br>
The object of the invention is accordingly to provide containers of polycarbonate<br>
which have greater breaking strength than known containers of polycarbonate when<br>
subjected to severe mechanical stress.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by containers of branched polycarbonate, characterised in that, at 260°C and a shear rate of 10 s"1, the polycarbonate has a melt viscosity of 5500 to 9000 Pas, preferably of 6000 to 8000<br>
3<br><br>
WO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT/EPOO/08471<br><br>
Pas and particularly preferably of 6500 to 8000 Pas and, at 260°C and a shear rate of 1000 s"1, a melt viscosity of 880 to 1500 Pas, preferably of 900 to 1500 Pas and particularly preferably of 950 to 1200 Pas and that it has an MFR (melt flow index, measured to IS01133) of 0.1 to 3.0 g/10 min, preferably of 0.5 to 2.8 g/10 min and particularly preferably of 0.5 to 2.5 g/10 min.<br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are preferably characterised in that phenol and/or alkylphenols and/or arylphenols are used in the production of the branched polycarbonate, with alkylphenols and/or arylphenols being particularly preferred and alkylphenols being very particularly preferred.<br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are furthermore preferably characterised in that phenol is used in the production of the branched polycarbonate and that the branched polycarbonate contains l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE) and/or 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole (IBK, isatin biscresol) as branching agent.<br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are furthermore preferably characterised in that the polycarbonate has a branching index at 260°C, defined as the quotient of melt viscosity at a shear rate of 10"1 and 1000 s"1, of 6 to 12, preferably of 7 to 12 and particularly preferably of 7 to 10. The branching index is abbreviated to SV index.<br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are furthermore preferably characterised in that alkylphenols and/or arylphenols are preferably used in the production of the branched polycarbonate, with alkylphenols being particularly preferred and that the branched polycarbonate contains l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE) and/or 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole (IBK, isatin biscresol) as branching agent.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT/EP00/08471<br><br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are particularly preferably characterised in that p-tert.-cumylphenol is used as the arylphenol in the production of the branched polycarbonate.<br>
The containers of branched polycarbonate are furthermore particularly preferably characterised in that p-tert.-butylphenol or isooctylphenol is used as the alkylphenol in the production of the branched polycarbonate.<br>
These containers are accordingly provided by the present invention.<br>
The present invention also provides the production of the containers according to the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of the containers according to the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides the branched polycarbonates of which the containers consist and which have the above-stated features.<br>
The containers according to the invention exhibit numerous advantages. They are resistant to mechanical stress, i.e. to breakage, and furthermore exhibit an advantageous range of further mechanical properties. They have good optical properties, in particular exhibiting elevated transparency. They have an elevated heat distortion temperature. Thanks to the elevated heat distortion temperature, the containers according to the invention may be cleaned with hot water or be sterilised with steam. They have elevated resistance to conventional cleaning agents, which are for example used for cleaning water bottles for multi-trip use, one area of application of the containers according to the invention. They may be produced easily and at low cost using known processes, the good processing characteristics of the polycarbonate being of particular advantage in this connection. They exhibit<br>
5<br><br>
WO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT/EP00/08471<br><br>
slight ageing of the material in service and thus a long service life. In the case of conventional multi-trip use, this means many usage cycles.<br>
Branched polycarbonates suitable according to the invention are both branched homopolycarbonates and branched copolycarbonates. A mixture of branched polycarbonates suitable according to the invention may also be used.<br>
It is possible to add a small proportion of unbranched polycarbonates to the branched polycarbonates, providing that the essential properties, in particular the elevated breaking strength, of the containers produced from the polycarbonates are not impaired.<br>
Preferred branched polycarbonates are those branched homopolycarbonates and branched copolycarbonates based on bisphenols of the general formula (I),<br>
HO-Z-OH	(I)<br>
in which<br>
Z        is a divalent organic residue having 6 to 30 C atoms, which contains one or more aromatic groups.<br>

Indan bisphenols and the production thereof are described, for example, in US-A 3 288 864, in JP-A 60 035 150 and in US-A 4 334 106. Indan bisphenols may, for example, be produced from isopropenylphenol or the derivatives thereof or from dimers of isopropenylphenol or the derivatives thereof in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst in organic solvents.<br>
The branched polycarbonates to be used according to the invention are produced in known manner from bisphenols, carbonic acid derivatives, branching agents, alkylphenols and/or arylphenols, optionally together with further substances which may act as chain terminators.<br>
Suitable processes for the production of polycarbonates are, for example, production from bisphenols with phosgene using the phase interface process or from bisphenols with phosgene using the homogeneous phase process, the so-called pyridine process, or from bisphenols with carbonic acid esters using the melt transesterification process. These production processes are described, for example, in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, volume 9, pages 31-76, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964. The stated production processes are also described in D. Freitag, U. Grigo, P.R. Miiller, H. Nouvertne, "Polycarbonates" in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, volume 11, second edition, 1988, pages 648 to 718 and in U. Grigo, K. Kircher and P.R. Miiller "Polycarbonate" in Becker, Braun, Kunststoff-Handbuch, volume 3/1, Polycarbonate, Polyacetale, Polyester, Celluloseester, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, Vienna 1992, pages 117 to 299 and in D.C. Prevorsek, B.T. Debona and Y. Kesten, Corporate Research Center, Allied Chemical Corporation, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, "Synthesis of poly(estercarbonate) copolymers" in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Chemistry Edition, volume 19, 75-90 (1980).<br>
The melt transesterification process is in particular described in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, volume 9, pages 44<br>

WO 01/19892<br><br>

to 51, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964 and in DE-A 1 031 512, in US-A 3 022 272, in US-A 5 340 905 and in US-A 5 399 659.<br>
The branched polycarbonates to be used according to the invention are preferably produced using the phase interface process or the known melt transesterification process. In the first case, the carbonic acid derivative is preferably phosgene, in the second case preferably diphenyl carbonate.<br>
The polycarbonate is preferably produced using raw materials and auxiliaries which have a low content of contaminants. In particular when production is performed using the melt transesterification process, the introduced bisphenols and the introduced carbonic acid derivatives should have the lowest possible content of alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions. Raw materials of such purity are, for example, obtained by recrystallising, washing or distilling the carbonic acid derivatives, for example carbonic acid esters, and the bisphenols.<br>
When producing polycarbonates by the melt transesterification process, the bisphenol and the carbonic acid diester may be reacted continuously or discontinuously, for example in stirred-tank reactors, thin film evaporators, falling film evaporators, stirred-tank reactors connected in series, extruders, kneaders, simple disk reactors and high viscosity disk reactors.<br>
Carbonic acid diesters which may be used for the production of polycarbonates are, for example, diaryl esters of carbonic acid, wherein both of the aryl residues preferably each have 6 to 14 C atoms. Carbonic acid diesters based on phenol or alkyl-substituted phenols, i.e. for example diphenyl carbonate or dicresyl carbonate, are preferably used. Relative to 1 mol of bisphenol, the carbonic acid diesters are preferably used in a quantity of 1.01 to 1.30 mol, particularly preferably in a quantity of 1.02 to 1.15 mol.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT/EPOO/08471<br><br>
The branched polycarbonates according to the invention have a weight average molar mass Mw of preferably 12000 to 120000 g/mol, particularly preferably of 26000 to 50000 g/mol and in particular of 31000 to 40000 g/mol (determined by measuring relative viscosity at 25°C in methylene chloride at a concentration of 0.5 g per 100 ml of methylene chloride and with calibration of the viscosity measurement by ultracentrifugation or measurement of light scattering).<br>
The phenols, alkylphenols and/or arylphenols used in the production of the branched polycarbonates according to the invention act as chain terminators, i.e. they limit the maximum achievable average molar mass. They are added either together with the monomers, which are required for the production of the polycarbonate, or during a subsequent phase of polycarbonate synthesis. They act as monofunctional compounds for the purposes of polycarbonate synthesis and thus act as chain terminators.<br>
The phenol, alkylphenols and/or arylphenols used for the production of the branched polycarbonates are preferably used in a quantity of 0.25 to 10 mol%, relative to the total of bisphenols used in each case.<br>
Mixtures of phenol and/or one or more alkylphenols and/or arylphenols may also be used.<br>
The alkylphenols and/or arylphenols used in the production of the branched polycarbonate give rise to alkylphenyl end groups and arylphenyl end groups respectively. Depending upon the production process, other end groups may also occur in the resultant polycarbonate, such as for example phenolic OH end groups or chlorocarbonic acid ester end groups.<br>
Preferably, solely phenol, alkylphenols and/or arylphenols are used, without the addition of further substances which may act as chain terminators.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT7EP00/08471<br><br>
Particular preferably, solely alkylphenols and/or arylphenols are used, without the addition of further substances which may act as chain terminators.<br>
One preferred alkylphenol is, for example, para-tert.-butylphenol (c.f Huston, Am. Soc. 58, 439; US-A 2 051 300). Para-tert.-butylphenol is a commercial product and may, for example, be obtained from Htils AG, Marl, Germany or PPG Industries, USA. Another preferred alkylphenol is para-cumylphenol (c.f. Welsch, Am. Soc. 60, 58 (1983)). Another preferred alkylphenol is isooctylphenol (c.f. US-A 2 415 069). Isooctylphenol is a commercial product and may, for example, be obtained from Hiils AG, Marl, Germany. These alkylphenols and the production thereof are known to the average person skilled in the art. A review of the use and the production thereof is described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, G. Thieme Verlag, 4   edition (1976), volume 6/lc, pages 951 etseq..<br>
When producing the branched polycarbonates according to the invention, further substances which may act as chain terminators may be used in addition to the alkylphenols and/or arylphenols.<br>
Substances suitable for this purpose which may act as chain terminators are both monophenols and monocarboxylic acids. Suitable monophenols are, for example, phenol, p-chlorophenol or 2,4,6-tribromophenol. Suitable monocarboxylic acids are benzoic acid, alkylbenzoic acids and halobenzoic acids.<br>
The preferred further substance which may act as chain terminator is phenol.<br>
The quantity of further substances which may act as chain terminators is preferably between 0.25 and 10 mol%, relative to the total of the bisphenols used in each case.<br>
The branched polycarbonates suitable according to the invention are branched in known manner, specifically preferably by incorporation of trifunctional or greater than trifunctional branching agents. Suitable branching agents are, for example,<br>
12<br><br>
\VO 01/19892<br><br>
PCT/EP00/08471<br><br>
those having three or more than three phenolic groups or those having three or more than three carboxylic acid groups.<br>
Suitable branching agents are, for example, phloroglucinol, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-<br>
(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-heptene, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptane,<br>
1,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyi)benzene, 1,1,1 -tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, tri-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)phenylmethane,	2,2-bis[4,4-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]propane, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)phenol, 2,6-<br>
bis(2-hydroxy-5'-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenol,	2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(2,4-<br>
dihydroxyphenyl)propane, hexa-(4-(4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)phenyl)terephthalic<br>
acid	ester,	tetra-(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane,	tetra-(4-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenylisopropyl)phenoxy)methane	and	1,4-bis(4',4"-dihydroxy-<br>
triphenyl)methylbenzene as well as 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride, 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole, trimesic acid trichloride and "-tris(4-hydroxyphenol)-l,3,5-triisopropylbenzene.<br>
Preferred branching agents are l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE) and 3,3-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole (IBK, isatin biscresol).<br>
The quantity of the optionally used branching agents is preferably 0.05 mol% to 2 mol%, more preferably 0.1 mol% to 0.8 mol% and very particularly preferably 0.25 mol% to 0.6 mol%, relative to the moles of bisphenols used.<br>
The branching agents may, for example when producing the polycarbonate by the phase interface process, be initially introduced into the aqueous alkaline phase together with the bisphenols and the chain terminators or be added as a solution in an organic solvent together with the carbonic acid derivatives. In the case of the transesterification process, the branching agents are preferably apportioned together with the dihydroxyaromatics or bisphenols.<br>

PCT7EP00/08471<br><br>
The properties of the branched polycarbonates according to the invention may be modified by incorporating conventional additives and/or by applying them onto the surface.

Breaking strength of the containers is preferably evaluated using the drop test, which is described below.<br>
Preparation for the actual measurement proceeds such that the shape and mass of the container are determined before the measurement. The test only compares containers of identical shape and identical mass. The mass of containers compared in the drop test may only differ by a maximum of 5%.<br>
The container is filled with distilled water at room temperature and then placed on a trapdoor platform, the floor of which takes the form of a trapdoor. For the first measurement, the trapdoor platform is raised until its floor is 0.5 m above the floor beneath, which consists of a thick steel plate. The trapdoor is then opened such that the water-filled container falls on the floor. If the container is not broken, the same container is put back on the trapdoor platform and raised to a height of 1 m for a second measurement by the container being dropped again in the described manner. Further measurements are made, with the drop height being raised by 0.5 m in each case. In this manner, a failure drop height is determined, which is defined as the height at which the hollow article breaks and the water runs out. An average failure<br>
