				<td>DESCRIPTION A PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OP TERBINAFINE AND<br>
DERIVATIVES THEREOF The present invention describes a synthesis method for  the  production  of  terbinafine  and  derivatives thereof.<br>
Terbinafine,  chemically  defined  as  (E)-W- (6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-inyl)-N-methyl-1-naphthalene-methylamine  and  having  the  structure  (1) ,  is  an antimicotic drug for topical and oral usef having the following chemical structure:<br><br>
The first, laboratory scale, synthetic route for this compound is described in European patent EP 0 024 * 587 and consists in reacting the lithium salt of tert-butylacetylene with acrolein, followed by an allylic bromination/rearrangement reaction, to give the intermediate (E+Z)-l-bromo-6,6-dimethyl-hepten-4-ine, which is then condensed with (1-naphthylmethyl) methyl amine to give a mixture of (E+Z) -N-<br><br>
(6, 6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-inyl) -N-methyl-1-naphthalene-methylamine from which terbinafine (1) is then isolated, in the hydrochloride form. This synthetic route has several drawbacks if used on the industrial scale; firstly, the use of acrolein, a toxic substance, difficult to obtain and transport in moderate industrial amounts and, above all, in the final stage, the formation of a mixture of E+Z isomers which must be separated by crystallisation, thus leading to a drastic reduction in the process yield.<br>
More recently, various alternative synthetic routes have been identified, leading to more industrially convenient processes. For example, the article by Alami et a.1. , Tetrahedron Lett. , 37, 57-58, (1996) describes the following synthetic method:<br><br><br>
This process comprises the initial alkylation of (1-<br>
naphthylmetyl) methanamine  (2) , with 1, 3-dichloropropene<br>
(3), raw materials which are both commercially available,<br>
to  give  the  intermediate  N-(3-chloro-2-propenyl)-N-<br>
methyl-1-naphthalene-methylamine (4) .<br>
This latter intermediate undergoes a wHeck-coupling" type reaction with tert -butylacetylene (5) in the presence of palladium or copper catalysts, to give terbinafine (1) . Essentially analogous processes are described in patents EP 0 421 3 02 and EP 0 645 369 and in the recent patent applications WO 01/77064, WO 02/02503 and EP 1 236 709. The latter report novel processes for final coupling using other types of catalysts, or particular reaction conditions. This synthetic route is brief, simply executed and generally characterised by good overall yield. On the other hand, it has low industrial applicability since it uses tert-butylacetylene (5) , a reagent that is still rather costly, together with palladium complexes and/or salts (for example tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) or dichloro-bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)), themselves also rather expensive. This has an influence over the final cost of the drug, with obvious social consequences.<br>
The present invention provides a synthetic method<br><br>
which allows overcoming all the above mentioned problems. This invention relates to a synthetic method for the production  of  terbinafine  and  analogues  thereof, including the step of reacting the compound of general formula (6):<br><br>

Preferably, R3 is: a naphthyl (C0-4) alkyl, either substituted or unsubstituted in any position with linear or branched (Ca-6) alkyl, linear or branched (Ci_6) alkenyl, linear or branched (Cx_6) alkynyl, (Ci-6) alkoxy, nitro, cyano, halo, trifluoromethyl, a tertiary amino group; or is an Si(R4)3 group, wherein R4 is a linear or branched (Cx-5) alkyl group. Even more preferably, R3 is an unsubstituted naphthyl (C0-4) alkyl group or is an Si(R4)3 group, wherein R4 is a linear (C^s) alkyl group.<br>
X  is  chlorine,  bromine,  iodine  or  fluorine,<br><br>
preferably it is either chlorine or bromine.   More preferably, it is chlorine.<br>
Even more preferably, R1 is a tert-butyl group, R2 is a methyl group and R3 is an a-naphthylmethyl group i.e. the product of general formula (8) is terbinafine.<br>
The metal catalyst may be selected from salts ox~ complexes of Ni, Pd, Cu, Fe, Sn, Zn and Ti. Preferably, the metal catalyst is a Ni and Pd salt or complex. Even more preferably, it is a Ni(II) complex or salt.<br>
Examples of Ni(II) salts include: nickel chloride, nickel bromide, nickel iodide, nickel fluoride, nickel sulphate, nickel nitrate, nickel acetate, nickel acetylacetonate and nickel oxide. The preferred salt is nickel chloride.<br>
Examples of Ni(II) complexes include:<br>
[1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane] dichloro nickel(II);<br>
[1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloro nickel(II);<br>
[1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane] dichloro nickel(II); dibromo bis(tributylphosphine) nickel(II); dibromo bis(triphenylphosphine) nickel(II); dichloro bis(tributylphosphine) nickel(II); dichloro bis(trimethylphosphine) nickel(II); dichloro bis(triphenylphosphine) nickel (II); The    preferred    complex    is    dichloro    bis<br>
(triphenylphosphine) nickel(II).<br><br>
The nickel salts and complexes may also be used as mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred amongst all the Ni catalysts is NiCl2 which emerged as being better with respect to dichloro bis(triphenylphosphine) nickel(II), allowing the reaction to be carried out under milder conditions and for shorter periods of time.<br>
The compound of formula (6) , in the case where R1 is a radical capable of forming a sufficiently stable carbocation, may be synthesised using the methodology<br><br>
MXn (with n = 2,3,4) are Lewis acids wherein X is a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, even more preferably chlorine;<br>
M is selected from:   iron, aluminium, zinc, tin,<br><br>
boron and titanium.  Preferably, M is iron or aluminium; even more preferably M is iron.<br>
The above Lewis acid is used in catalytic amounts together with a solvent selected from either chlorinated solvents, particularly methylene chloride and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or nitro-organic compounds, particularly nitrobenzene or mixtures thereof.<br>
The use of high boiling point solvents (boiling<br>
points in excess of 100Â°C) is particularly preferable<br>
since the relative vapour pressure for the two reagents<br>
(11) and (12) is reduced, thus limiting their evaporation<br>
during the reaction.<br>
The preferred reaction method consists in the addition of a solution of reagents (11) and (12) to a suspension or solution of MXn in one or more of the above mentioned solvents at a temperature within the range 10-40Â°C and preferably between 20Â° and 25Â° C. Product (13) may be easily isolated by fractional distillation, either directly from the reaction mixture, or following a normal aqueous work-up, with yields from 50 to 90 molar percent, preferably from 55 to 60 molar percent and purity from 80 to 99%, preferably from 96 to 98%.<br>
Step 2, in scheme 2, is conveniently carried out using an inorganic base, such as for example potassium or sodium  hydroxide,   sodium  or  potassium  carbonate,<br><br>
preferably NaOH or KOH, in a polar solvent with a high boiling point, such as for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diglyme, dimethylsulphoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylf ormamide, dimethylacetamide, preferably ethylene glycol, and by distillation of the product directly from the reaction mixture.<br>
The  product  (14)  is  subsequently  reacted  with  an<br>
organolithium base (step 3) R5Li, wherein R5 is methyl, n-butyl,<br>
sec-butyl, tert-butyl# n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, preferably n-<br>
butyl, or rather directly with metallic lithium to give product<br>
(6) with quantitative yield.<br>
Alternatively, compound (14) may be converted directly into product (6) {step 4) , by reacting with two moles of an organolithium base (R5Li) or else directly with metallic lithium.<br>
In the first case, the reaction may be performed directly in non-polar solvents such as toluene or heptane at a temperature of between 20Â° and 110Â°C and preferably within the range 70-90Â°C; instead, in the second case it is necessary to use an ethereal solvent, from amongst which, tetrahydrofuran is preferred. The most preferred is the reaction which provides step 4. In the case where an organolithium base is used, it<br><br>
is preferable to remove the corresponding alkyl halide w2hich forms in the reaction by distillation, prior to performing the subsequent coupling reaction.<br>
The overall outline for the preparation of compound (6) is described in the following publications: H.G.Viehe and S.Y. Delavarerme, Chem. Ber. 103, 1216-1224 (1970) and Z. Wang et al.   Tetr.   Lett.   41 (2000), 4007-4009.<br>
However, the methods reported in the above documents are characterised by low industrial applicability. The optimisation introduced by the present invention, especially with regard to step 1, has provided a synthetic methodology allowing the attainment of product (6) under milder conditions and with higher yield. These and further advantages of the use of reaction outline 2 will be discussed below.<br>
It is understood that reagent (6) may also be obtained by using synthetic methodologies other than that illustx-ated without departing from the scope of protection of the present invention.<br>
In cases where R3 is a Si(R4)3 group, wherein R4 is as described above, reagent (7) may be obtained according to the following synthetic scheme:<br><br><br>
The most convenient process involves the addition of compound (15) to an aqueous amine mixture (14) in molar excess, and a non-polar organic solvent,  such as for example heptane, hexane, pentane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene,  mesithylene  or  mixtures  thereof,  preferably heptane, at a temperature of between 0 Â° and 100Â° C, preferably between 15Â° and 25Â° C, for a period of time of 0.5 to 5 hours, preferably of 1 to 3 hours.  That way, it is possible to minimise formation of the dialkylation byproduct, which remains more or less quantitatively in the non-polar solvent at the end of the reaction, whilst compound (17) remains in the aqueous moiety   and may be subsequently extracted with a polar solvent, such as for example methyl  tert-butyl  ether,  methylene  chloride, ethyl acetate,  diethyl ether, preferably methyl tert-butyl ether or methylene chloride.   Product  (17)  is purified by distillation, but, not being particularly stable, it has been more convenient to use the product in crude  form,  or by performing the  isolation of  the<br><br>
corresponding hydrochloride salt, obtained through the addition of hydrochloric acid directly into the final solution in an organic solvent.<br>
The nitrogen group on the intermediate of formula (17) may conveniently be protected by reacting with compound (18) in the presence of an organic base, such as for example triethylamine, trimethyl amine, N-ethyl-di-isopropylamine, diazabicyclononane (DBN) , diazabicycloundecene (DBU), preferably triethylamine, in an inert solvent, such as for example toluene, methyl tert-butyl ether, di-isopropyl ether, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, preferably toluene, in order to give product (7a) *<br>
The protection reaction takes place under very mild conditions at temperatures within the range 0Â°-50 Â°C and preferably within the range 20Â°-3 0Â°C and is complete within a few hours.<br>
The work-up provides the filtration of the chloride from the used organic base (for example triethylamonium chloride) and concentration to a small volume under vacuum with the aim of eliminating any possible excess of compound (18) .<br>
The product of general formula (7a) is subsequently reacted in situ with the suspension of product (6) in a solvent   such   as   THF,   dioxan,   glyme,   diglyme,<br><br>
dimethoxyethane,   diethoxyethane,   toluene,   xylene, preferably in a THF/toluene mixture, with a suitable catalyst (nickel salts or complexes or mixtures thereof) and then heating the reaction mixture to a temperature within the range 50-100Â°C and preferably between 70Â°' and 95Â°C; the reaction is complete and quantitative within 0.5-10 hours, preferably 1-4 hours. Thus, product (8a) is obtained, wherein R3 is a Si(R4)3 group and R1, R2 and R4 are as defined above. Following this synthetic route, product (8a) must be subsequently modified according to the following scheme:<br><br>
in order to obtain the final product (8) wherein R1, R2, R3 are as defined above.<br>
In particular, compound (8a) may be subjected to a simple aqueous work-up, optionally in the presence of acids or bases, (step 1 in outline 4) in order to obtain the de-protected product (8b) which may be used as crude product or isolated by distillation or by the crystallisation of a suitable organic or inorganic salt thereof (for example as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, citrate, oxalate, succinate or tartrate salt). The latter<br><br>
may be easily alkylated with product (19) (step 2) in a<br>
ketone solvent (for example: acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone) or aprotic<br>
polar solvent (for example: dimethyl formamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide,	N-methylpyrrolidone r<br>
Dime thy lsulphoxide) and in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium acetate, in order to trap the hydrochloric acid produced.<br>
The crude final product (8) is obtained by the separation of the aqueous phase and concentration of the solvent to residue. Preferably, compound (8) is isolated from the crude mixture in hydrochloride form.<br>
The crude product is dissolved in a solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, isopropyl acetate, isopropanol, toluene, preferably isopx-opanol, methyl ethyl ketone, more preferably methyl ethyl ketone; then HCl is added and precipitation of the product hydrochloride is obtained (8) . Separation from the solvent occurs according to techniques known in the art, for example by filtration.<br>
One preferred application consists in heating a mixture of (8b) and (19) in toluene, with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, optionally in the presence of  a phase  transfer  catalyst,  such as  for example<br><br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bisulphate, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, cetyl-trimethylammonium chloride, preferably tetrabutylamonium bromide, at a temperature of between 50 and 100Â°C, preferably between 70Â° and 90Â°C for a period of time of 1 to 10 hours, preferably 4-6 hours. The reaction is quantitative and the crude product (8) is obtained simply by separation of the aqueous phase and concentration of solvent to residue. However, it has been surprisingly found that isolation of intermediate (8b) is not in fact necessary, in that product (8a) may be reacted directly with compound (19) , according to the previously described process, so as to directly give the crude final product (8). Indeed, given the relative instability of compounds of this type: <br>
the alkylation reaction conditions are sufficient to destroy the Si(R4)3 group, with the in situ formation of the intermediate (8b) which reacts immediately with compound (19) to give the final product (8).<br>
This final embodiment is the most preferred since it allows the attainment of final product (8) starting from compounds (15) and (16), with a practically "one pot" process.  Using this method, product (8) is preferably<br><br>
obtained in the hydrochloride form, with an overall yield of 4 0-80 molar percent, preferably 50*65 molar percent with purity from 95 to 100%f preferably in excess of 99%. When R3 is other than Si(R4)3, then product (7) may be obtained according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
reported in patents EP 0 421 302 and EP 0 645 369. Product (7) is used, without purification, in the 1 subsequent coupling step with compound (6) following the same aforementioned methods, thus directly giving the final product (8) . Again, in this case, the preparation of (8) is practically "one-pot1*, starting from reagents (20) and (15).<br>
Work-up of the reaction provides an initial treatment with an aqueous solution of a Ni complexing agent, for example, an aqueous solution of EDTA, ammonia, ethylene diamine, tetramethylethylene diamine, preferably an aqueous solution of ammonia, in order to remove it from the organic phase; a subsequent wash with water and then concentration of the remaining organic phase to residue allows attainment of the crude product (8) with quantitative yield and purity from 60 to 95%, preferably<br><br>
from 70% to 90% (HPLC) .<br>
Preferably, compound (8) is isolated in hydrochloride form by the addition of hydrochloric acid to the solution of crude product dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, such as for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or toluene; the resulting precipitate in then isolated by filtration.<br>
The overall yield of this process, as product (8) in hydrochloride form, is between 50 and 90 molar percent, preferably between 60 and 70 molar percent, and the product thus obtained has a purity of between 95 and 100%, preferably in excess of 99% (HPLC, A% - percentage peak area from HPLC analysis) .<br>
Obviously, product (7) may also be obtained through other synthetic methods without departing from the scope of protection of the present invention.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The method currently most used for the synthesis of terbinafine is reported in scheme 1. This synthetic process is brief, simple to perform and gives good yield, however, it uses tert-butylacetylene and palladium catalysts which are both very expensive compounds. This all has an influence over the final price of the drug, with obvious social consequences. The present invention<br><br>
provides two linked, equally valid synthetic routes which allow the attainment of terbinaf ine and derivatives thereof, in a way which is more economical and more suited to industrial application.<br>
The key step is the reaction between compound (6) , easily synthesised and much more economical than tert-butylacetylene, and compound (7) , obtainable thxough rapid and economical synthetic routes. The use of very economical Ni catalysts, especially Ni salts, and compound (6) allow a drastic reduction in the total production costs for terbinafine and derivatives thereof. Furthermore, the coupling reaction may be carried out under much milder conditions and for much shorter times.<br>
Compound (6) is obtained through a synthetic route (scheme 2) reported in the literature, which has been selected since it uses very economical starting materials (11) and (12) . This method has been optimised in the present invention, thus providing a method characterised by improved industrial applicability. The use of A1C13 as a Lewis acid in step 1 has indeed been reported in the literature. As shown experimentally, the use of aluminium chloride in this reaction causes uncontrolled HC1 production and significant foaming, making it unsuitable for large scale industrial use. Instead, according to the present invention, the use of a weaker<br><br>
Lewis acid (for example FeCl3) , and different methods for the addition of the reagents, together with the use of a high boiling point solvent, allows the attainment of more controllable reaction conditions. More conveniently, compound (13) may be treated directly with an organolithium base or with metallic Li (step 4) thus shortening reaction times.<br>
Compound (7) may be obtained using the method reported in scheme 5, already published in the literature. Conveniently, in this case, the final product (8) is obtained not only by using an economical and industrially applicable method, but also by using an essentially "one-pot" process, and hence much more x~apid.<br>
Indeed, the only purification step performed throughout this synthetic route is that of the final product.<br>
Alternatively, compound (7a) may be obtained by starting from the very economical reagents (15) and (16), using the process outlined in schemes 3 and 4, which is practically wone-pot", and hence very rapid. Again, in this case, the only product to be purified is the final product.<br>
Hence, in summary, the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of terbinafine and analogues thereof, characterised by. good industrial applicability,<br><br>
good process speed and ease of execution and a yield comparable with the processes of the known art. Above all/ it provides a method which is much more economical than the known art, which is reflected in a significant reduction in the final cost of the drug.<br>
