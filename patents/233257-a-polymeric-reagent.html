				<td>The present inventions relates to a polymeric reagent.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to novel polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group such as, for example, a ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemlketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. In addition, the invention relates to conjugates formed from the attachment of a polymeric reagent described herein to another substance, such as an active agent. Furthermore, the invention relates to methods for synthesizing polymeric reagents, methods for conjugating a polymeric reagent to another substance, compositions comprising the polymeric reagents; and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Scientists and clinicians face a number of challenges in their attempts to develop active agentis into forms suited for delivery to a patient. Active agents that aie polypeptides,, for example, are often delivered by injection rather than orally. In this way, the polypeptide is introduced into the systemic circulation without   -exposure to the proteolytic environment of the stomach. Injection of polypeptides, however, has several drawbacks. For example, many polypeptides have a relatively short half-life, thereby necessitating the need for repeated injections, which are often inconvenient and painful. Moreover, some polypeptides may elicit one or more immune responses with the consequence that the patient's immune system may be activated to degrade or inactivate the polypeptide. Thus, the delivery of polypeptides and other active agents is often problematic even when these agents are administered by injection.<br>
Some success in addressing the problems of delivering active agents via injection has been achieved. For example, conjugating the active agent to a water-soluble polymer has resulted in polymer-active agent conjugates having reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity. In addition, these conjugates often have greatly increased half-lives compared to their unconjugated counterparts as a result of<br><br><br>
' decreased clearance through the kidney and/or decreased enzymatic degradation in vivo. As a result of having a greater half-life, the conjugate requires less frequent dosing, which* in turn reduces the overall number of painful injections and inconvenient visits to a health care professional. Moreover, active agents that are only marginally soluble often demonstrate a significant increase in water solubility when conjugated to a water-soluble polymer.<br>
Due to its documented safety as well as its approval by the FDA for both topical and internal use, poly(ethylene glycol) has been conjugated to active agents. When an active agent is conjugated to a polymer of poly(ethylene glycol) or "PEG", the conjugated active agent is conventionally referred to as having been "PEGylated." The commercial success of PEGylated active agents attests to their value. Exemplary commercially available PEGylated polypeptides include PEGASYS® PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ), PEG-INTRON® PEGylated interferon alpha-2b (Schering Corp., Kennilworth, NJ), SOMAVERT® PEGylated human growth hormone receptor antagonist, and NEULASTA® PEG-filgrastim (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA). PEGylated small molecules such as distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Zalipsky (1993) Bioconjug. Cliem. 4(4):296-299) and fluorouracil (Ouchi et al. (1992) Drug Des. £&gt;«cov.9(l):93-105) have also been prepared.<br>
Despite these successes, conjugation of a polymer to an active agent remains challenging. In particular, the conjugation reaction is relatively imprecise in that a relatively disperse mixture of products results. For example, the conjugation reaction often results in a mixture of singly substituted, disubstituted, and polysubstituted conjugate forms. Moreover, the possible number of different conjugate forms increases inasmuch as different attachment sites of an active agent can result in different arrangements of attachments. For example, a singly substituted active agent having three different sites for attachment to a polymer can have three different forms: each form having the single polymer attached to one of the three different attachment sites. Recognizing that each conjugate form can have a unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile only serves to underscore the complexity associated with providing polymer-active agent conjugates that are suited for use as therapeutic agents. Thus, there is a desire to provide polymeric<br><br>
reagents that are "site-directed" so that the desired conjugates can be more predictably formed.<br>
Some- degree of selectivity in the conjugation reaction is achieved based on the presence of the particular functional group present on the polymeric reagent. For example, poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives bearing an aldehyde derivative (shown below) undergo reductive amination reactions with primary amines of, for example, a polypeptide.<br>
a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative bearing an aldehyde derivative wherein (n) represents the number of repeating ethylene oxide units<br>
As a consequence, a degree of selectivity is achieved in that conjugation typically occurs only between the relatively reactive and readily accessible primary amine groups of the polypeptide and the aldehyde of the polymeric reagent. For polypeptides having many relatively reactive primary amine groups (e.g., a polypeptide having many primary amine-containing lysine residues), however, the conjugation reaction nonetheless results in a relatively polydisperse mixture of conjugate forms.<br>
In order to provide an alternative to polymeric reagents bearing aldehyde derivatives, the present invention provides polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group (e.g., a ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal).<br>
Others have described polymers comprising a ketone or a related functional group for use in variety of contexts. Typically, however, the described polymers are unsuited for conjugation.<br>
For example, WO 96/33156 describes poly(alkylene glycol) derivatives of benzophenone and related aromatic moieties. The derivatives are described as being useful as photoinitiators. Aromatic rings, however, are preferably absent in polymeric reagents useful for conjugation to an active agent because the hydrophobic nature of aromatic moieties undesirably decreases aqueous solubility.<br><br>
In addition, aromatic rings contained in a conjugate may be metabolized in vivo into arene oxide intermediates, which can covalently bind with nucleophilic groups present on prpteins, DNA and RNA, thereby leading to cellular toxicity. See Daly et al. (1979) Experientia 28(10):! 129-1149.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,149,806 describes a carbon acid useful as a Michael donor. One of the described structures is provided below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Even if structures like these could be used for conjugation reactions, the propylene oxide polymers are not suitably water-soluble to provide a conjugate acceptable for in vivo administration.<br>
Other previously described polymeric reagents suffer from similar deficiencies.<br>
Thus, there remains a need in the art to provide polymeric reagents that are useful for providing, among other things, conjugates with other substances. The present invention addresses this and other needs in the art by providing, inter alia, novel polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group (e.g., a ketone hydrate, thione, rhonothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal).<br>

Thus, for example, reference to "polymeric reagent" includes a single polymeric reagent as well as two or more of the same or different polymeric reagents, reference to a "conjugate" includes a single conjugate as well as two or more of the same of different conjugates, reference to an "excipient" includes a single excipient as well as two or more of the same or different excipients, and the like.<br>
In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.<br>
"PEG," "polyethylene glycol" and "poly(ethylene glycol)" as used herein, are meant to encompass any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure "-O(CH2CH2O)m-" where (m) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes "-CH2CH2-O(CH2CH2O)m-CH2CH2-" and "-(CH2CH2O)m-," depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. When the PEG further comprises a spacer moiety (to be described in greater detail below), the atoms comprising the spacer moiety, when covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer segment, do not result in the formation of an oxygen-oxygen bond (i.e., an "-O-O-rt or peroxide linkage). Throughout the specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term "PEG" includes structures having various terminal or<br><br>
"end capping" groups and so forth. The term "PEG" also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of -CEkCHaO- repeating subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as "branched," "linear," "forked," "multifunctional," and the like, to be described in greater detail below.<br>
The terms "end-capped" and "terminally capped" are interchangeably used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C|_2o alkoxy group, more preferably a Q.io alkoxy group, and more preferably a C\.$ alkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled to can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties (such as the ability to form organized structures with similarly end-capped polymers) are imparted to the polymer. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of di lauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br><br>
"Non-naturally occurring" means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer may, however, contain one or more subunits-or segments of subunits that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.<br>
The term "water soluble" as in a "water-soluble polymer segment" and "water-soluble polymer" is any segment or polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer or segment will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of light, transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer or segment thereof will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer or segment is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.<br>
"Nominal average molecular weight" in the context of a water-soluble, non-naturally occurring polymer of the invention such as PEG, refers to the mass average molecular weight of the polymer, typically determined by size exclusion chromatography, light scattering techniques, or intrinsic velocity determination in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.

"Thiol derivative," in the context of a water-soluble, non-naturally occurring water soluble polymer, means such a polymer having at least one terminus that is a thiol group (-SH), a thiolate (-S") or a protected thiol, that is to say, a thiol group in its protected form. Typical thiol protecting groups include thioether, thioester, or disulfide.

The terms "active" and "activated" when used in conjunction with a particular functional group, refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily<br><br>
with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "nonreactive" or "inert" group).<br>
The terms "protected," "protecting group" and "protective group" refer to the presence of a moiety (i.e., the protecting group) that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule, if any. Protecting groups known in the art can be found in Greene, T.W., et al, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS. 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY (1999).<br>
As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is meant to encompass protected forms thereof.<br>
An "organic radical," in the context describing a structure, a structural formula, a molecule, and so forth, refers to a carbon-containing moiety wherein a carbon atom provides a point of attachment. Exemplary organic radicals include, alkyl (e.g., lower alkyl), substituted alkyl (including heteroalkyl, and chain-substituted heteroalkyl), alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclicyl, substituted heterocyclicyl, and so forth.<br>

"Aryl" means one or more aromatic rings, each of 5 or 6 core carbon atoms. Aryl includes multiple aryl rings that may be fused, as in naphthyl, or unfused, as in biphenyl. Aryl rings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, "aryl" includes heteroaryl.<br>
"Heteroaryl" is an aryl group containing from one to four heteroatoms, wherein each heteroatomin the heteroaryl ring is preferably a sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.<br>
"Heterocyclicyl" or "heterocyclic" means a group of one or more rings of 5-12 atoms, preferably 5-7 atoms, with or without unsaturation or aromatic character and having at least one ring atom which is not a carbon. Preferred heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.<br>
The term "substituted" as in, for example, "substituted alkyl," refers to a moiety (e.g., an alkyl group) substituted with one or more non-interfering<br><br>

"Electrophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms, that may be ionic, having an electrophilic center, i.e., a center that is electron seeking, capable of reacting with a nucleophile.<br>
"Nucleophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may be ionic having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an electrophilic center or with an electrophile.<br>
A "physiologically cleavable" or "hydrolyzable" or "degradable" bond is a relatively weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. Preferred are bonds that have a hydrolysis half-life at pH 8 and 25 °C of less than about 30 minutes.  The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include, but are not limited to, carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, and oligonucleotide bonds.<br>
An "enzymatically degradable linkage" means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes.<br>
A "hydrolytically stable" linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages<br><br>
include, but are not limited to, the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic<br>
chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable<br>
linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day<br>
under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds<br>
can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.	<br>
"Active agent," as described herein, includes any agent, drug, compound, composition of matter, or mixture that provides some pharmacologic, often beneficial, effect that can be demonstrated in-vivo or in vitro. This includes foods, food supplements, peptides, nutrients, nutriceuticals, drugs, vaccines, antibodies, vitamins, and other beneficial agents. As used herein, these terms further include any physiologically or pharmacologically active substance that produces a localized or systemic effect in a patient.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier" refers to an excipient that may optionally be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse lexicological effects to thepatient. "Pharmacologically effective amount," "physiologically effective amount," and "therapeutically effective amount" are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a polymer-active agent conjugate that is needed to provide a desired level of active agent in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular drug or therapeutic agent, the components and physical characteristics of the therapeutic composition, intended patient population, individual patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein.<br>
"Multi-functional" means a polymer having 3 or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or different. Multifunctional polymeric reagents of the invention will typically contain from about 3-100 functional groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25 functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from 3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3,4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups within the polymer backbone.<br>
A basic or acidic reactant described herein includes neutral, charged, and any corresponding salt forms thereof.<br><br>
The term "patient," refers to a living organism suffering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of an active agent, and includes both humans and animals.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
The polymeric reagents described herein comprise a water-soluble polymer segment and a functional group. The functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. The functional group can be attached to the water-soluble polymer segment through a through a direct covalent bond. More typically, however, the functional group is attached to the water-soluble polymer segment through one or more atoms. Thus, in its most elemental form, the polymeric reagents described herein all share a core structure comprising:<br>
POLY	FG<br>
wherein POLY is a water-soluble polymer segment, FG is a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal, and the dashed line represents a direct covalent bond or one or more atoms serving to attach the functional group to the water-soluble polymer segment. As will be seen in more detail below, the polymeric reagents described herein can have more complex structures.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is-believed that polymeric reagents bearing a ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal are more selective for use in conjugating to another substance (e.g., active agent) than a polymer bearing, for example, an aldehyde. One factor contributing to the increased selectivity of the polymeric reagents described herein is the relative stability associated with the functional group(s). As a result of being more stable,<br><br>
the functional group(s) of the polymeric reagent tend to only react with relatively more reactive moieties, thereby providing a greater degree of selectivity.<br>
The ihcreased stability of ketones, ketone hydrates, thiones, monothiohydrates, dithiohydrates, hemiketals, monothiohemiketals, dithiohemiketals, ketals, and dithioketals compared to other functional groups such as aldehydes is believed to be a function of two effects: electronic effects and steric effects. With respect to electronic effects, crowding at the functional group effectively provides the ability of the functional group to "share" the burden any ionization or "excess charge" that may occur during a reaction. Thus, for example, a ketone —having two carbon atoms attached on either side of a carbonyl carbon-can better absorb the electron-rich environment associated with a carbonyl moiety than the corresponding aldehyde, which has only one carbon.<br>
With respect to steric effects, nucleophilc addition to the carbonyl group of both aldehydes and ketones changes the carbonyl carbon from sp2 hybridization to sp3 hybridization. The presence of a second — and relatively large — carbon atom associated with a ketone, however, slows the approach of the relatively bulky active agent to the sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon and sterically crowds the forming sp3 hybridized carbon much more than the relatively small hydrogen associated with an<br>
aldehyde. As a consequence, the combination of both electronic and steric effects increases the activation energy of ketones and related functional groups by decreasing their starting energy state (i.e., by providing a stabilized carbonyl carbon, an electronic effect) and raising the energy of the transition state (i.e., the change from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, a steric effect). Thus, ketones and related functional groups are relatively more stable and hence less reactive.<br>
Surprisingly, however, it has been found that the increased stability of ketone-, ketone hydrate-, thione-, monothiohydrate-, dithiohydrate-, hemiketal-, monothiohemiketal-, dithiohemiketal-, ketal-, or dithioketal-bearing polymeric reagents is advantageous. For example, an active agent may have several amine groups, each having its own reactivity toward a carbonyl moiety present on a polymeric reagent. By providing a relatively less reactive ketone-bearing polymeric reagent, conjugation will occur more preferentially between the least<br><br>
sterically hindered and most reactive amine(s) on the active agent and the carbonyl moiety of the ketone, thereby reducing the number of different conjugate forms.<br>
Another advantage of the polymeric reagents described herein is that the functional group can be between two polymer chains (which may be linear), thereby providing the ability to attach two polymer chains through a single atom that is directly attached to an active agent, surface, or other moiety. Previously described branched polymeric reagents comprise a spacer moiety having a reactive group (e.g., aldehyde) for conjugation and separate and distinct branching atom that serves to link two polymer chains. In this way, the water-soluble polymer segments can be brought relatively closer to the active agent, thereby decreasing or eliminating entirely small "pendent" groups left behind on an active agent when a water-soluble polymer segment is cleaved from the conjugate, n.      FEATURES OF THE POLYMERIC REAGENTS<br>
A. The Functional Group ("FG")<br>
As previously stated, the polymeric reagents of the invention are associated with a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. Structurally, each functional group ("FG") is shown below. In the structures, R stands for an organic radical, e.g., alkyl, and the "functional group carbon" is designated with an asterisk.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Although not shown, a carbon atom must be attached on each side of the functional group carbon in order to provide the named functional group.<br>
Advantageously, the described functional groups are often easily transformed into each other. Thus, for example, some or all of a ketone can be transformed into a ketone hydrate by the addition of water. Moreover, in the presence of water, a ketone generally exists in an equilibrium with the corresponding hydrate. This is especially true with ketones having a proximate electron-withdrawing group. Because of equilibrium, as the amount of water in a ketone-containing system is decreased, the amount of the ketone hydrate species decreases. Thus, by controlling the amount of water in the system, it is possible to influence the amount (or ratio) of the two forms (e.g., ketone and ketone hydrate). Other factors, such as the presence or absence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups and proximal steric hindrance, also influence the amount of and ratio between the two forms. Thione and monothiohydrate forms can also be provided in a similar fashion.<br>
Usefully, conjugation reactions employing the presently described polymeric reagents can often proceed without regard-to controlling the specific solvation status of the functional group. For example, it makes no difference whether the predominating species of the polymeric reagent is a ketone or a ketone hydrate; using one, the other, or both under conjugation conditions will result in the formation of polymer-active agent conjugates. While not wishing to be bound by theory, ketone hydrates - - in equilibrium with the corresponding ketone - - can be used because as the ketone species is being depleted during the conjugation reaction with the active agent, the equilibrium causes additional ketone hydrate species to be transformed into the corresponding ketone. The series of reactions is depicted in Figure 1. As shown therein, two equilibria reactions are involved: the equilibria between the ketone and ketone hydrate in a polymeric reagent and the condensation processes involving an amine group on an active agent to form the carbinolamine and corresponding imine. Thus, while conjugation may proceed via the ketone, use of the corresponding ketone hydrate form will also result in formation of the desired conjugate. Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that increased stability of the hydrate form (as compared to the corresponding ketone<br><br>
form) corresponds to increased reactivity of the ketone form to conjugation to an active agent.<br>
. In addition, ketones can be converted into hemiketals through the addition of an alcohol. Again, as the amount of alcohol to a ketone-containing system is decreased, the amount of hemiketal species decreases. In this way, in equilibria reactions similar to those discussed above, it is possible to provide a hemiketal by adding alcohol to a ketone-containing system and providing a ketone by removing alcohol from a hemiketal-containing system. Moreover, in the presence of an acid catalyst, additional quantities of alcohol will transform a hemiketal into a ketal. In addition, ketones can be directly transformed into ketals by the addition of a diol, e.g., HO-CEbCHa-OH, in the presence of an acid catalyst. Advantageously, these and other ketals often serve as ketone protecting groups.<br>
Figure 2 schematically depicts the formation of a ketal from a polymeric reagent bearing a ketone functional group, and of a conjugate from a polymeric reagent bearing a ketal functional group. In Figure 2, a polymeric reagent bearing a ketone functional group can be initially converted into a reactive hemiketal intermediate, and then into the ketal (in this Figure, a dimethyl ketal). Figure 2 also illustrates, through a series of equilibria, how ketals can be utilized directly in conjugation reactions with an amine-containing active agent.<br>
In a similar way, thiones can be transformed into dithiohydrates (sometimes referred to as dithiosolvates) by solvating the thione in a sulfur-containing (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) environment. Thiones can also be transformed into dithiohemiketals in the presence of thiols, and into dithioketals in the presence of excess thiol. In a way analgous to ketones, thiones can be directly transformed into dithioketals by the addition of a dithiol, e.g., HS-CH2CH2-SH. Dithioketals often serve as thione protecting groups as well.<br>
Although exemplary methods for transforming a given functional group into another functional group have been provided, the polymeric reagents are not limited in the manner in which the functional group is formed. Those of ordinary skill in the art know of other approaches for providing the functional groups described herein. Moreover, reference to any given functional group encompasses both the functional group per se, as well as to protected forms of the functional group.<br><br>
B. The Water-Soluble Polymer Segment ("POLY," e.g., "POLY1," "POLY2," etc.)<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention also comprise at least one water-soluble polymer segment. Water-soluble polymer segments that are nonpeptidic and water-soluble, with from 2 to about 300 termini, are particularly useful in the invention. Examples of suitable water-soluble polymer segments include, but are not limited to, poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG"), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol having water-solubility, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,384, and copolymers, terpolymers, and mixtures thereof. For purposes of the present invention, poly(propylene glycol) has insufficient water-solubility to act as a water-soluble polymer segment. Consequently, it is preferred that water-soluble polymer segments described herein do not contain propylene monomers.<br>
It is preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer segment is preferably, although not necessarily, a poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG") or a derivative thereof. It should be understood, however, that related polymers are also suited for use in the practice of this invention and that the use of the term "PEG" or "poly(ethylene glycol)" is intended to be inclusive and not exclusive in this respect. Consequently, the term "PEG" includes poly(ethylene glycol) in any of its linear, branched or multi-arm forms, including alkoxy PEG, bifunctional PEG, forked PEG, branched PEG, pendant PEG, or PEG with degradable linkages therein, to be more fully described below.<br>
In one form useful in the present invention, free or nonbound PEG is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups:<br>
HO-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH2O)m.-CH2CH2-OH (m1) typically ranges from zero to about 4,000.<br>
The above polymer, alpha-, omega-dihydroxylpoly(ethylene glycol), can be represented in brief form as HO-PEG-OH where it is understood that the -PEG-symbol can represent the following structural unit:<br><br>
-CH2CH20-(CH2CH20)ra.-CH2CH2-where (m1) is as defined as above.<br>
Another type of PEG useful in the present invention is methoxy-PEG-OH, or mPEG in brief, in which one terminus is the relatively inert methoxy group, while the other terminus is a hydroxyl group. The structure of mPEG is given below.<br>
CH3O-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH20)m
Multi-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, can also be used as the PEG polymer. For example, PEG can have the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
polya and polyb are PEG backbones (either the same or different), such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol);<br>
R" is a nonreactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and<br>
P and Q are nonreactive linkages. In a preferred embodiment, the branched PEG polymer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) disubstituted lysine.<br>
These polymers may be linear, or may be in any of the above-described'" forms (e.g., branched, forked, and the like).<br>
In addition, the PEG can comprise a forked PEG. An example of a forked PEG is represented by the following structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein: X is a spacer moiety and each Z is an activated terminal group linked to CH by a chain of atoms of defined length. International Application No. PCT/US99/05333, discloses various forked PEG structures capable of use in the<br><br>
present invention. The chain of atoms linking the Z functional groups to the branching carbon atom serve as a tethering group and may comprise, for example, alkyl chains,'ether chains, ester chains, amide chains and combinations thereof.<br>
The PEG polymer may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having reactive groups, such as carboxyl, covalently attached along the length of the PEG rather than at the end of the PEG chain. The pendant reactive groups can be attached to the PEG directly or through a spacer moiety, such as an alkylene group.<br>
In addition to the above-described forms of PEG, the polymer can also be prepared with one or more weak or degradable linkages in the polymer, including any of the above described polymers. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight:<br>
-PEG-CO2-PEG- + H2O  	*• -PEG-CO2H + HO-PEG-<br>
Other hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful as a degradable linkage within a polymer backbone, include: carbonate linkages; imine linkages resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al. (1997) Polymer Preprints 38(l):582-3); phosphate ester linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are typically formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are typically formed by reaction between an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester linkages that are, for example, formed by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; amide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of another PEG chain; urethane linkages formed from reaction of, e.g., a PEG with a terminal isocyanate group and a PEG alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of a peptide; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by, for example, a phosphoramidite group, e.g., at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.<br>
It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the term poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the above forms of PEG.<br><br>

It is understood that the maximum limit of molecular weight for any given water-soluble polymer segment useful herein is less than about 300,000 Daltons.<br>
The nominal average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segment can also be expressed as being a value within a range of nominal average molecular weights. Exemplary ranges include: from about 100 Daltons to about 100,000 Daltons; from about 500 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons; from about<br>
v<br>
1,000 Daltons to about 50,000 Daltons; from about 2,000 Daltons to about 25,000 Daltons; and from about 5,000 Daltons to about 20,000 Daltons.<br>
Exemplary nominal average molecular weights for the. water-soluble polymer segment include about 100 Daltons, about 200 Daltons, about 300 Daltons, about 400 Daltons, about 500 Daltons, about 600 Daltons, about 700 Daltons, about 750 Daltons, about 800 Daltons, about 900 Daltons, about 1,000 Daltons, about 2,000 Daltons, about 2,200 Daltons, about 2,500 Daltons, about 3,000 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,400 Daltons, about 5,000 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 8,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 13,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons, about 15,000 Daltons, about 20,000 Daltons, about 22,500 Daltons, about 25,000 Daltons, about 30,000 Daltons, about<br><br>

With'respect to PEG, wherein a structure corresponding to<br>
i<br>
"-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH2O)m-CH2CH2-" can be provided, preferred values for (m) include: from about 3 to about 3,000; from about 10 to about 3,000; from about 15 to about 3,000; from about 20 to about 3,000; from about 25 to about 3,000; from about 30 to about 3,000; from about 40 to about 3,000; from about 50 to about 3,000; from about 55 to about 3,000; from about 75 to about 3,000; from about 100 to about 3,000; and from about 225 to about 3,000.<br>
As used herein, the term "water-soluble polymer segment" includes those water-soluble polymer segments that are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic and specifically excludes any water-soluble polymer segments that are not biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. With respect to biocompatibility, a substance is considered biocompatible if the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., active agent) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. With respect to non-immunogenicity, a substance is considered nonimmunogenic if the intended use of the substance in vivo does not produce an undesired immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. It is particularly preferred that the water-soluble polymer segments described herein as well as conjugates are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. As used herein, the term "water-soluble polymer segment" also excludes those water-soluble polymer segments made of monomers comprising one or more ketone moieties.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing discussion concerning substantially water-soluble polymer segments is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated. As used herein, the term "polymeric reagent" generally refers to an entire molecule, which can comprise a water-soluble polymer segment and a functional group. The term "water-soluble polymer segment" is generally reserved for use in discussing one portion of a larger<br><br>
molecular structure such as a polymeric reagent, precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth.<br>
C. Attachment Through One or More Atoms<br>
Each portion (e.g., functional group, active agent, water-soluble polymer segment, and so forth) of the polymeric reagent and other structures described herein can be directly attached to each other via a direct covalent bond. More typically, however, each portion is attached through one or more atoms serving to tether each portion together into a unified whole.<br>
Preferred atoms through which the various portions of the polymeric reagents and other structures described herein include a chain of atoms made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur atoms. Attached to this chain of atoms, can be one or more other atoms such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen. The chain can be short and comprise as few as a chain of two to five atoms. Longer chains, for example, a chain of atoms of ten, fifteen, or more in length are also contemplated. Thus, a great number of different combinations of atoms are possible for attaching portions of the molecules described herein. Typically, however, three different groups of atoms are associated with linking the various portions of the polymeric reagents and other molecules described herein: a carbon chain; an electron withdrawing group; and a spacer moiety. Each will be discussed in turn.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (i)       The Carbon Chain, (e.g., Optionally, one or more carbon chains is included in the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugates, precursor molecules to form the polymeric reagents, and so forth). Typically, but not necessarily, the carbon chain is located immediately adjacent to the functional group of the polymeric reagent. Notwithstanding the absence of a carbon chain, however, a carbon atom (from, for example, a spacer moiety, organic radical, electron-withdraing group, and so forth) must be attached on each side of the functional group carbon.<br><br>
When present, the carbon chain can have any number of carbon atoms so long as the overall polymeric reagent remains water soluble. Typically, however, there will be'l, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, or 7 carbons in the carbon chain. Preferably, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth) will lack a hydrocarbon chain of 8 carbons or greater. Thus, with respect to the various carbon chains structurally defined herein, each of (z), (y), and (x) can independently be zero, a positive integer, such as 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, and 7, a positive integer from 1 to 7, a positive integer from 2 to 7, and so forth.<br>
Due to its tetravalent character, each carbon in the carbon chain has two groups attached to it. As structurally defined herein, these groups have been designated as R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9.   Each of these groups, when present, is independently either hydrogen or an organic radical. A preferred form includes each occurrence of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9, when present, as hydrogen.<br>
Exemplary classes of moieties from which any of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can independently be chosen from include H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, and substituted aryl. Although, as further explained below, aromatic moieties are preferably absent. Specific moieties from which any of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can independently be chosen from include H, methyl, ethyl, »-propyl, isopropyl, /z-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, and vinyl. In addition, and two of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can be joined to form a cyclic ring system, which may bridge certain carbon chain atoms.<br>
Another exemplary form includes defining the carbon chain as having an organic radical (e.g., a lower alkyl) attached to the carbon in the chain a to the functional group carbon. Advantageously, the presence of such an organic group in this position increases the selectivity of the polymeric reagent. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the steric effects of the organic radical further increases the activation energy necessary for the functional group to react. An exemplary carbon chain (attached to a ketone having a terminal methyl group) showing the a carbon and a p carbon is provided below, wherein a methyl group is attached to the a carbon and all other substituents in the carbon chain are hydrogen.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Preferably, when an organic radical is attached to a carbon a to the functional group carbon, the atom p to the functional group carbon is or is part of an electron-withdrawing group. Thus, exemplary arrangements are provided below wherein an oxygen atom is used as the electron-withdrawing group<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Although the above structures use oxygen as an electron-withdrawing group, electron-withdrawing groups other than oxygen (e.g., carbonyl) can be used.<br>
When the carbon a to the functional group carbon bears an organic radical (e.g., methyl), the resulting polymeric reagent may comprise a chiral center. Specific chirality, however, is not explicitly illustrated herein with respect to any compound or structure comprising one or more chiral centers. Thus, the present discussion encompasses both the isomerically pure forms of any optically active<br><br>
corapound described herein, as well as enantiomeric mixtures, including a racemic mixture, thereof.<br>
Optionally, when two or more carbons are in the carbon chain, the carbon chain can include a carbon-carbon double bond. Such unsaturated groups can offer additional possibilities for reactions, such as the ability of the polymeric reagents to provide conjugate addition of a nucleophile to the p carbon of an a-p unsaturated ketone, as shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
An a-p unsaturated ketone is often called an enone. Thus, while one or more carbon-carbon double bonds can be included at any position of the carbon chain, it is preferred that when a double bond is present, the double bond is located between the terminal a and p carbons relative to the functional group carbon (e.g., the carbonyl carbon). As will be discussed below, however, enones may preferably be absent from the polymeric reagents described herein.<br>
(ii)      The Electron Withdrawing Groups ("EW,"e.g., "EW1," "EW2," "EW3," etc.)<br>
An electron-withdrawing group is optionally located within the polymeric reagent (or corresponding precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth) and can comprise the atoms that serve to link various portions of a larger molecule together. An electron-withdrawing group is any atom or group of atoms including electronegative atom(s) and in some cases, having resonance interactions among some of the atoms in the electron-withdrawing group that create an enhanced electron-withdrawing effect. Electrons are attracted to the electronegative atom(s) of the electron-withdrawing group, thereby influencing the chemistry of a nearby functional group. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group adjacent (i.e.,<br><br>
"ct") to or within two to six atoms distant from the functional group carbon effectively destabilizes this carbon by withdrawing electrons, thereby increasing the overall reactivity of the functional group. Thus, for example, the presence of an electron-withdrawing group near a ketone group will increase its reactivity toward amines in a reductive animation reaction and other reactions wherein nucleophilic addition takes place.<br>
It is preferred, however, that the presence and/or location of the electron-withdrawing group does not render the functional group overly reactive, thereby frustrating the ability to provide relative selectivity during, for example, conjugation reactions. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether any given electron-withdrawing group as well as whether the location of the electron-withdrawing group renders the functional group overly reactive. For example, conjugation techniques discussed herein can be performed using different polymeric reagents, each having a"different electron-withdrawing group and/or an electron-withdrawing group at different distances from the functional group carbon. Those polymeric reagents providing desired reactivities as evidence through, for example, single conjugation to a protein, are not overly reactive.<br>
Any electron-withdrawing group can be included and the invention is not limited in this regard. Generically, electron-withdrawing groups include -O-, -NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-NH-, -NH-OC(O)-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxyl substituent. With respect to the structures then, electron-withdrawing groups designated as "EW1" are preferably selected from the group consisting of -O-, -NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(0)-NH-, -NH-OC(O)-, -C(O)-, -C(S)-, and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxyl substituent, while electron-withdrawing groups designated as "EW2" and "EW3" are each preferably independently selected from the group consisting of -0-, -NH-, -C(O)NH-, -NHC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O&gt;, -NH-OC(O)-, -OC(O)-NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxy substituent. A preferred electron-withdrawing group is -C(O)-, either alone or as part of amide or carbamate. A particularly preferred electron-withdrawing group is -O-.<br><br>
(iii)     The Spacer Moiety ("X," e.g., "X1," "X2," "X3, "X4", "X5," etc.)<br>
' Optionally, the polymeric reagents provided herein (as well as the corresponding precursor molecules, conjugates, and so forth) include a spacer moiety. Exemplary moieties suited for any spacer moiety designated as X1 and X4 are those independently selected from the group consisting of-O-, -S-, -C(O)-, -O-C(O)-, -C(O)-0-, -C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-NH-, -O-C(O)-NH-, -C(S&gt;, -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -CH2-O-, -0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-, -O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-, -0-CHrCH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-0-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-0-CH2-, -C(O)-O-CH2-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-,-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -0-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -NH-CH2-, -NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -0-C(0)-NH-[CH2]o-6-(OCH2CH2)o-2-,-C(0)-NH-(CH2)i.6-NH-C(0)-, -NH-C(0)-NH-(CH2),.6-NH-C(0)-, -O-C(O)-CH2-, -O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, and -O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-. Exemplary moieties suited for any spacer moiety<br><br>
designated as X2, X3, and X5 include those independently selected from the group consisting of-O-, -S-, -C(O)-, -O-C(O)-, -C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-0», -C(S)-, -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CHr, ~0-CHr&gt; -CH2-0-, -0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-, -O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-, -0-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-0-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-.NH-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-,-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-,CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-)-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-C(O)-, -CH2-O-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-C1I2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-O-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-O-, -CHrCHrCHrNH-C(O)-O-, -CH2-NH-, -CH2-CH2-NH-, -CH2-NH-CH2-, -CH2-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, ~C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -(CH2CH20)o-2-(CH2)o-6-NH-C(O)-0-,-C(O)-NH-(CH2)i.6-NH-C(O)-) -C(O)-NH-(CH2);.6-NH-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-C(O)-O-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-, and -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-.<br>
In any of the above, a simple cycloalkylene group, e.g., 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexylene, may replace any two, three, or four carbon alkylene group.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, however, a series of atoms is not a spacer moiety when the series of atoms is immediately adjacent to a water-soluble polymer segment and the series of atoms is but another monomer, such that the<br><br>
proposed spacer moiety would represent a mere extension of the polymer chain. For example, given the partial structure "POLY-X-," and POLY is defined as "CH3O(eH2CH2O)m-" wherein (m) is 2 to 4000 and X is defined as a spacer moiety, the spacer moiety cannot be defined as "-CEkCHaO-" since such a definition would merely represent an extension of the polymer. In such a case, however, an acceptable spacer moiety could be defined as "-CHaCEb-."<br>
D. Other Features<br>
In addition to those features already described, the polymeric reagents (and corresponding precursor molecules and conjugates) can have other optional features.<br>
For example, the entire polymeric reagent (as well as the organic radicals present in the polymeric reagent) preferably lacks an aromatic moiety. As used herein, an entity lacks an aromatic moiety when the entity is completely free of a conjugated system of n electrons that closes upon itself. Typical of aromatic<br>
moieties are those that comprise a benzene,"\=/," structure. The presence of an aromatic structure is undesired because such structures decrease water solubility and can result in harmful effects in vivo. For the same reasons, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack halogen atoms (e.g., F, Cl, Br and I) in their structures. The presence of either halogen atoms or aromatic moieties can be warranted in certain circumstances, however, such as in a method for making a polymeric reagent wherein protection groups include aromatic or halogen atoms. In addition, ionized forms of halogens can also be useful to form salts, which are not typically harmful in moderate amounts. As used herein, a polymeric reagent lacking a halogen atom does not include instances wherein the polymeric reagent (or conjugate formed therefrom) is in a salt form having a halogen counterion.<br>
In addition, the polymeric reagents preferably lack a cyclic dienone. As used herein, a cyclic dienone is a ketone wherein the carbonyl carbon is part of a cyclic structure and the a,P carbons on either side of the carbonyl carbon are have a double bond. Schematically, the core structure of cyclic dienones can be generically represented as:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
Exemplary cyclic dienones lacking in the polymeric reagents include the <br>
following:   O   ;    0   ;      ^-^      ; and      ^^^       . It is believed that the presence of such doubly a,|3-unsaturated structures in a polymeric reagent may result in conjugate addition of a nucleophile. This approach to conjugation may not, however, have the same selectivity as, for example, reductive amination through a ketone. Consequently, the polymeric reagents preferably lack cyclic dienones. Moreover, it can also be the case that the polymeric reagents also lack an enone (i.e., an a,p~unsaturated ketone). When, however, an alternative conjugation approach is desired, an enone can be present.<br>
In addition, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack other reactive groups that could impede the selectivity. For example, the polymeric reagents preferably lack a terminal oxylamine group (i.e., -ONHa). In addition, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack a terminal hydrazine group (i.e., -NHNHz).<br>
In some cases, the polymeric reagents of the invention are not in certain forms. Thus, for example, the polymeric reagents are not in the following forms:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and ketal derivatives of any of the foregoing. It will be understood that "mw" refers to the weight average molecular weight of the ethylene oxide moiety, and that a range such as "1-50" provided adjacent to a monomer indicates that the moiety encompasses the monomer repeating from 1 to 50 times, inclusive.<br><br>
E. Structurally Defined Polymeric Reagents<br>
As will be described in further detail below, the polymeric reagents of the invention'can be provided in a number of forms.<br>
In some instances, the polymeric reagent is linear in form and comprises a single water-soluble polymer segment and a single functional group. An exemplary polymeric reagent of this form comprises the following structure:<br><br>

More specific (although nonlimiting) examples polymeric reagents of this form include those selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein (m) is from about 3 to about 3000.<br>
Another example of a linear polymeric reagent of the invention is a polymeric reagent comprised of a carbon-containing functional group and a water-soluble polymer segment, wherein the carbon of the carbon-containing<br><br>
functional group is part of a cyclic structure and further wherein the cyclic structure is attached to the water-soluble polymer segment through either a direct covalent bond or throngh a spacer moiety, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
With respect to the cyclic structure, any nonaromatic ring can be used and the invention is not limited in this regard. Exemplary cyclic structures include:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
, oxa and aza forms thereof and dioxa and diaza forms of any of the foregoing.<br>
Preferably, when one or more heteroatoms are present in the cyclic structure, at least one heteroatom is situated in the alpha or beta position of the functional group carbon. Exemplary heteroatom-containing cyclic structures wherein a heteroatom is situated at a beta position include: oxacyclohexyl, e.g.,<br>

 Another class of reagents that may advantageously contain a ketone group or one of its forms are heterobifunctional polymeric reagents. Of most use are those that react with different types of biomolecules. For example, one may have a ketone that would react with an amine group in a protein or polypeptide and a-5         maleimide functional group that would react with a thiol group in a different protein or polypeptide.

15         invention.<br>
Advantageously, the polymeric reagents of the invention can comprise more than a single water-soluble polymer segment. Often, such polymeric reagents are conventionally referred to as "branched." As will be seen in further detail below, branching can be effected in the currently described polymers at the functional<br>
20         group carbon or at a point other than the functional group carbon. Branching<br>
effected at the functional group carbon provides a linear and branched polymeric reagent, thereby providing a "V" arrangement. Branching effected by a moiety other than the functional group carbon is typically nonlinear and the resulting polymeric reagent is often in the form of a letter "Y."<br>

As is evident from the polymeric reagents of Formulas IV, F/a, IVb, and IVc, the functional group carbon serves as the branching point through which each of two water-soluble polymer segments is ultimately attached. In this way, the polymeric reagent has a form resembling the letter "V" or a flattened form thereof. Each water-soluble polymer segment can also be further branched, thereby providing a polymeric reagent with four or more water-soluble polymer segments.<br>

In some instances of the branched polymeric reagent forms of the present invention, a moiety other than the functional group carbon serves as the branching moiety. In such a case, however, the branching moiety must provide at least three attachment sites, one attachment site providing a linkage (either directly or through one or more atoms) to each of the functional group, the first water-soluble polymer segment, and the second water-soluble polymer segment.<br>

Exemplary branched polymers suitable for use as a water-soluble polymer segment herein are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462 and are based on a disubstituted lysine residue. Two specific examples of lysine-based branched polymers include an ester-containing version:<br><br>

Thus, for example, polymeric reagents encompassed by the following structure result by substituting PEG for each of POLY1 and POLY2 and using the amide-containing, lysine-based branched structure as the branching moiety with respect to Formula V:<br><br>

wherein each of (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R2, R3, R14, FG, is as previously defined with respect to Formula V, and (m) is from 3 to about 3,000.<br>
In addition, polymeric reagents encompassed by the following structure result by substituting PEG for each of POLY1 and POLY2 and using the amide-containing, lysine-based branched structure as the branching moiety with respect to Formula IV:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein each of R2, R3, R8, R9, (a), (b), (e), (f), (z), (x), X1, EW1, FG, EW3, and X3 are as previously defined, and (m) is from 3 to about 3000.<br>
Polymeric reagents comprising two or more water-soluble polymer segments advantageously provide higher molecular weight species without having to use a relatively long single polymer. Thus, for example, a polymeric reagent comprising two water-soluble polymer segments wherein each segment has a nominal average molecular weight of about 5,000 Daltons will have a total molecular weight of about 10,000 Daltons.<br>
In the context of delivering a conjugate formed from a polymeric derivative comprised of two or more water-soluble segments, individual water-soluble polymer segments can be cleaved in vivo. As one or more water-soluble polymer segments are cleaved from the conjugate, the smaller size of the resulting conjugate often results in improved clearance of the conjugate from the body. By selecting the molecular weight (i.e., size) of the water-soluble polymer segment and/or cleavable linkage in the polymeric reagent, it is possible to modulate the clearance profile of a conjugate. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segment as well as the cleavable linkage based on routine experimentation by, for example, preparing a variety of polymeric reagents with different water-soluble polymer segments weights and cleavable linkages, conjugating each of the polymeric reagents with an active agent, administering each of the conjugates to a patient, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling). Thereafter, it is possible to<br><br>
determine which polymeric reagent (based on the corresponding conjugate) provides the desired clearance profile.<br>
The pdlymeric reagents can also take other forms. For example, the polymeric reagent can be comprised of a functional group attached, either through a direct covalent bond or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment, wherein: (a) the functional group is selected from the group consisting ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithibhydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal of thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, and dithioketal, and (b) the polymeric reagent lacks saturated hydrocarbon segments having 8 carbon atoms or more. It is preferred, that the functional group is selected from the group consisting of thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, and dithioketal.<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention can be provided in the form of a composition. Typically a composition comprises two or more of the same or different polymeric reagents in addition to one or more optional components. While it may be impossible in some contexts to remove all undesirable components of a composition, it is preferred that the compositions of the polymeric reagents described herein are free or substantially free of undesirable components. Examples of undesirable components will be known to those of ordinary skill and are often dependent upon the intended uses of the composition and/or polymeric reagent. Specific examples, however, typically include impurities, components that would cause harm (i.e., be toxic) if administered to a patient, unreacted materials remaining from previous synthetic steps, and so forth.<br>
Preferably, the composition will be substantially free or, more preferably, entirely free of oxidation side products. Compositions can often be rendered substantially free or entirely free of oxidation side products by purifying a composition through, for example, chromatography, to remove any undesired oxidation side products. Another approach is to provide the polymeric reagent and any other components comprising the composition without using an oxidation step. In addition, care must be taken not to allow atmospheric oxygen to react with the composition or any of its components, thereby allowing for the creation of<br><br>
oxidation side products in the composition. In the present context, a composition that is substantially free of oxidation side products is at least 75% (by weight) free of oxidation side 'products, more preferably at least 85% (by weight) free of oxidation side products, still more preferably at least 90% (by weight) free of oxidation side products, yet more preferably at least 95% free of oxidation side products, even more preferably at least 98% (by weight) of oxidation side products, with at least 99.9% (by weight) free of oxidation side products being most preferred.<br>
Among other problems, oxidation side products can render a polymeric-- reagent composition unsuited for use as a reagent in a conjugation reaction. For example, an oxidation side product can be a cleaved portion of a water-soluble polymer segment such as PEG, which can occur when a water-soluble polymer segment has been exposed to oxidizing conditions.   In addition, an oxidation side product can be an oxidizing agent itself, which was not completely removed following a synthetic step. The agent can continue to oxidize the products of the composition, thereby initiating undesired chain cleavage of the water-soluble polymer segment. Thus, oxidation side products are preferably absent from the compositions described herein.<br>
Thus, the invention also encompasses compositions comprising a polymeric reagent comprised of a functional group attached, either through a direct covalent bond or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment, wherein the composition is substantially free of oxidation side products.<br>
An example of a polymeric reagent that can (although not necessarily) be a component of a composition that is substantially free of oxidation side products is comprised of the following structure:<br><br><br>

The functional groups other than ketone discussed herein, (i.e., ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal) can be substituted for the ketone functional group in Formula VI. m.     METHODS FOR MAKING POLYMERIC REAGENTS<br>
Before discussing the various methods for making polymeric reagents, it must be pointed out that the methods, at times, rely on the use of a protected form of a functional group. Some functional groups, such as ketals, may not require protecting. Moreover, some functional groups serve as a protected form for another functional group associated with the presently described polymeric reagents (e.g., ketals often serve as a protected form for ketones). Those of ordinary skill in the art know suitable protecting forms for each of the functional groups associated with the presently described polymeric reagents. For example, protected forms of a ketone include ketals (either cyclic or of a diether type). A ketal can be formed by reacting a ketone with an alcohol, diol, thiol, or dithiol in the presence of an acid catalyst. The ketal so formed (as well as other ketals) can be transformed into a ketone by<br><br>
acid hydrolysis. Other protected forms, as well as protecting and deprotecting the various functional groups discussed herein, are provided in Greene et al. supra.<br>
The various steps for making a polymeric reagent are carried out in a suitable solvent. One of ordinary skill in the ait can determine whether any specific solvent is appropriate for any given reaction step. Often; however, the solvent is preferably a nonpolar solvent or a polar aprotic solvent. Nonlimiting examples of nonpolar solvents include benzene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), /-butyl alcohol and toluene. Particularly preferred nonpolar solvents include toluene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and f-butyl alcohol. Exemplary polar aprotic solvents include, but are not limited to, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), HMPA (hexamethyjphosphoramide), DMF (dimethylformamide), DMA (dimethylacetamide), and NMP (//-methylpyrrolidinone).<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention can be synthesized using a variety of routes. It should be noted that common techniques discussed with respect to one method often apply to similar techniques discussed in other methods. Consequently, discussion of any specific technique for a given method is not limited to that method and therefore applies to each method utilizing that technique.<br>
In some routes, the polymeric reagent is formed via a polymerization approach. Thus, for example, a polymeric reagent can be formed by a method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one active anionic site suitable for initiating polymerization and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal;<br>
(ii) contacting the anionic site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule;<br>
(iii) adding additional reactive monomers to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains;<br>
(iv) allowing said adding to continue until a desired length of the one or more polymer chains is reached;<br><br>
 (v) terminating the reaction, thereby resulting in a polymeric reagent comprised of the functional group or protected form thereof; and<br>
(vi) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
The anionic site serves as an initiator site for polymerization and is typically, although not necessarily, an alkoxide moiety. Alkoxide moieties are advantageously obtained by subjecting the corresponding alcohol to a deprotonating base, thereby removing the hydrogen atom from the alcohol to yield the desired alkoxide moiety.<br>
In order to form a polymeric reagent corresponding to Formula IV, a precursor molecule comprising the following structure can be used:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
Polymeric reagents corresponding to Formula I can be formed through a method comprising this approach wherein the precursor molecule comprises the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), EW1, R1, R2, and R3, are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
If the diol corresponding to Formula Vila is used or the alcohol corresponding to Formula VHb is used (wherein a hydrogen atom is attached to each alkoxide moiety), an added step of removing the hydrogen (by, for example, treating the alcohol with a deprotonating base) is required in order to yield the alkoxide initiator sites. In addition, thiolates (i.e., -S") can be used in the place of alkoxide moieties. In such a case then, the corresponding thiol or dithiol can be placed in a based to provide the necessary ionic site suited for polymerization.<br>
Specific molecules suited for use as precursor molecules in this approach include the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
These and other molecules suited for use as precursor molecules can be obtained commercially (either as shown above or in their corresponding alcohol forms) and/or may be synthesized using conventional techniques.<br><br>
Having provided a precursor molecule with an initiator site (e.g., an anionic site) suited for polymerization, the next step in this approach comprises the step of contacting the' initiator site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule. Any reactive monomer can be used to "grow" the polymer chain(s) so long as the resulting polymer chain is water soluble. It is particularly preferred, however, that the reactive monomer is ethylene oxide, thereby providing poly(ethylene oxide) chain(s). These and other polymerization techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are referenced in, for example, Odian, Chap. 7, Principles of Polymerization, 3rd Ed., McGraw-Hill, 1991.<br>
Once polymerization is initiated, additional reactive monomers are added to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains. The addition of the reactive monomers effectively allows the one or more polymer chains to "grow." Growth of the polymer chain(s) continues until a desired molecular weight is achieved, at which time the reaction is terminated. Termination can occur through any of a number of art known methods. For example, neutralizing the reaction medium will halt the growth of the polymer chain(s). In addition, adding a specific weight or amount of the reactive monomer and allowing the polymerization to proceed until all reactive monomer is exhausted results in a polymer chain having a certain and determinable molecular weight. The result is a polymeric reagent comprising a functional group or protected form thereof.<br>
Optionally and prior to carrying out an end-capping step, an electrophilically reactive polymer (either hydrophobic or hydrophilic) can be added to the polymer chain(s).<br>
An added benefit of the ethoxylation route is that it allows for capping the living polymer end (i.e., the terminal of the polymer where additional monomers can be added) with various moieties including other polymers. This allows for the generation of polymers with different properties. Thus, it is possible to cap the already formed water-soluble polymer segment with a hydrophobic polymer and generate a final polymer having hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. More importantly for many applications, it is possible to add an electrophilically reactive<br><br>
PEG derivative, thereby providing chain extension while, at the same time, adding a hydrolytically cleavable unit. The latter point is important with drug delivery of active agents,-such as pharmacologically active proteins, which may have undesirable clearance profiles from the body. A generalized example of this chain extending capping comprises reacting a monosubstituted PEG derivative that gives a carbonate, urethane or similar functional group linkage with the living polymer. Attachment of the polymer, however, must not result in a polymer conjugate that is neither water-soluble nor immunogenic.<br>
Having formed the water-soluble polymer segments in the polymeric reagent, an end-capping group optionally can be added using conventional techniques. For example, an alkyl halide (e.g., methyl halide or methyl j9-toluenesulfonate) can be reacted with the exposed terminal (the terminal or termini distal to the functional group or protected form thereof) of the polymer chain. In addition, the one or more polymer chains can be capped with an additional polymer.<br>
Optionally, when the polymeric reagent bears a protected form a functional group, the functional group can be removed using art known methods. For example, a kctal moiety (either cyclic or a diether type) can be removed by undergoing hydrolysis. Again, reference is made to Greene et al. supra, for methods of removing other protecting groups.<br>
An advantage of this ethoxylation-based approach for providing polymeric reagents having a central functional group a water-soluble polymer segment on each side of the functional group is the flexibility of molecular weight control and in the capping step. For example, one may polymerize to give a living polymer with an average molecular weight of 5,000 Daltons and cap the hydroxy end groups by adding a methylating reagent. This gives a polymer with a molecular weight of about 5,000 Daltons that has stable (relatively unreactive) end groups but with a functional moiety roughly in the center of the polymer derivative. In addition, one may cap the living polymer with chain extenders to give a higher molecular weight or with functionally reactive ether groups, such as benzyl to give a removable group that could lead to the potential of chemical modification of the end groups.<br><br>
Another polymerization-based approach for making polymeric reagents involves the use of a protected secondary alcohol. In particular, this approach the method comprises the steps of<br>
(i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of a protected secondary alcohol or thiol and at least one anionic site suitable for initiating polymerization;<br>
(ii) contacting the anionic site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule;<br>
(iii) adding additional reactive monomers to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains;<br>
(iv) allowing said contacting to continue until a desired length of the one or more polymer chains is reached;<br>
(v) terminating the reaction, thereby resulting in an intermediate comprised of the protected secondary alcohol or thiol;<br>
(vi) deprotecting the protected secondary alcohol or thiol of the intermediate to form an unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol;<br>
(vii) oxidizing the unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol to provide a polymeric reagent comprised of a ketone when the precursor molecule comprised a secondary alcohol or a thione when the precursor molecule comprised a secondary thiol; and<br>
(viii) optionally further modifying the ketone or thione to result in a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
Thus, with respect to steps (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), involving the use of polymerization techniques, the same polymerization techniques discussed above apply equally as well here. As above, the anionic site serves as an initiator site for polymerization and is typically, although not necessarily, an alkoxide moiety. Alkoxide moieties are advantageously obtained by subjecting the corresponding alcohol to a deprotonating base, thereby removing the hydrogen atom from the alcohol to yield the desired alkoxide moiety.<br><br>
In order to form a branched polymeric reagent of Formula IV using this approach, the precursor molecule will comprise the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur and "pg" is a protecting group for a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen and a protecting group for a secondary thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
Polymeric reagents corresponding to Formula I can be formed through a method comprising this approach wherein the precursor molecule comprises the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur and "pg" is a protecting group for a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen and a protecting group for a secondary thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
As previously indicated, the precursor molecule comprises a protected secondary alcohol or thiol. Any suitable, art-known protecting group suitable for protecting a secondary alcohol or thiol can be used, and include, for example, benzyl ether, methyoxymethyl ether (MOM), methylthiomethyl ether (MTM), tetrahydropyranyl ether (THP), 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl ether, tetrahydrofuranyl ether, 1-ethoxyethyl ether, 1-methyl-l-methoxyethyl ether, 2-(phenylselenyl)ethyl ether, allyl ether, o-nitrobenzyl ether, triphenylmethyl ether, a-naphthyldiphenylmethyl ether, p-methyoxyphenyldiphenylmethyl ether, 9-(9-phenyl-10~oxo)anthryl ether (tritylone), isopropyldimethylsilyl ether,<br><br>
r-butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBDMS), tribenzylsilyl ether, and triisopropylsilyl ether. A particularly preferred protecting group for use with the method is benzyl ether. Specific molecules (in the corresponding alcohol forms) suited for use as precursor molecule in this approach include a monoprotected glycerol having the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur, "pg" is a protecting group suitable for protecting a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen or thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
A particularly preferred monoprotected glycerol is 2-benzyloxy-1,3-propanediol shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These and other monoprotected glycerols are available from commercial suppliers such as Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and/or can be synthesized using conventional techniques.<br>
Having formed the water-soluble polymer segment, along with optionally additionally attaching an electrophilic polymer and optionally alkylating the terminal or termini of the water-soluble polymer segment or segments, the method comprises the step of deprotecting the protected secondary alcohol or thiol to form an unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol. The protecting group can be removed using art known methods. For example, the deprotecting step can be effected by exposing the intermediate to Eb and a metal catalyst such as palladium, palladium oxide, nickel, platinum, or lead.<br>
After the deprotecting step, the method comprises carrying out an oxidizing step, which can be performed in any conventional manner and the invention is not limited in this regard. Examples of suitable oxidizing techniques comprise<br><br>
contacting the intermediate to be oxidized with an oxidizing reagent selected from the group consisting of KMnO4&gt; MnOa, KaG^O?, CrO^, pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium fluorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, RuO4, RuCl3, tetra-;z-propylammonium perruthenate, dimethyl sulfoxide, TV-chlorosuccinimide, Ag2CO3, AG2O, and Dess-Martin periodinane reagents.<br>
Other approaches for forming the polymeric reagents of the invention are not based on a polymerization approach. In one nonpolymerization approach for providing a polymeric reagent of the invention, the method comprises the steps of (i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one isocyanate moiety and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; and (ii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule and a water-soluble polymer segment bearing at least one hydroxyl or arnine group to thereby form a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and (iii) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
In this third approach, a number of precursor molecules comprising at least one isocyanate moiety can a functional group or protected form thereof can be used.<br>
In order to form a branched polymeric reagent of Formula IV using this approach, the reaction will comprise contacting: (a) a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione,<br><br>
monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing one terminal hydroxyl group.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment will be added in at least a 2:1 molar to the isocyanate precursor molecule. It is preferred, however that an excess of the -water-soluble polymer segment is present.<br>
In order to form a polymeric reagent of Formula I using this approach, the reaction comprises contacting: (a) a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
0=C=N<br><br>
R2<br>
C+-PFG-R1	(Formula Kb)<br>
R3J<br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing one terminal hydroxyl or amine group.<br>
The water:soluble polymer segment will be added in at least a 1:1 molar ratio of water-soluble polymeric reagent to isocyanate precursor molecule. It is preferred, however that an excess of the isocyanate precursor molecule is present.<br>
In order to form a homobifunctional polymeric reagent, the reaction will comprise contacting: (a) a precursor molecule of Formula IXb; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing two terminal hydroxyl groups. The water-soluble polymer segment is typically in no more than a 1:2 molar ratio to isocyanate precursor molecule.<br><br>
In a fourth approach for preparing a polymeric reagent, a method is provided comprising the steps of (i) providing a water-soluble polymer segment having at least ene available nucleophilic group; (ii) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one activating group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; (iii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule with the water-soluble polymer segment, thereby forming a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and (iv) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group can be any polymer terminating in a nucleophilic group. Such polymers include, without limitation: polymers bearing a terminal amine (e.g., amine-terminated PEG, available from, for example, Nektar Therapeutics, Huntsville, AL). The activating group of the precursor molecule can be any suitable activating group as that term is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, but an activating group selected from the group consisting of halide (e.g., fluoride, chloride, iodide), sulfonate esters (e.g., methansulfonate, /&gt;-toluenesulfonate, and so forth), and N-succinimidyl is preferred.<br>
Branched polymeric reagents of Formula IV can be formed using this approach by contacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group; with a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein each AC is an activating group and pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein<br><br>
the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment is added in at least a 2:1 molar ratio to the precursor molecule. Preferably, however, an excess of the water-soluble polymer segment is added.<br>
Polymeric reagents of Formula I can also be prepared using this approach. Thus, a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group is contacted with a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2,-and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein AC is an activating group and pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. The water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group is added in amount equaling at least a 1:1 molar ratio of water-soluble polymer segment to the precursor molecule. It is preferred, however, that an excess of the water-soluble segment is present.<br>
A homobifunctional polymeric reagent can also be prepared by reacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least two available nucleophilic groups with a precursor molecule having a structure corresponding to Formula Xb. In this instance, the molar ratio of water-soluble polymer segment to precursor molecule is typically no more than 1:2, and typically an excess of the precursor molecule is present.<br><br>
A fifth approach for making a polymeric reagent comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available leaving group;<br>
(ii) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one nucleophilic group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal;<br>
(iii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule with the water-soluble polymer segment, thereby forming a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and<br>
(iv) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
Preferred leaving groups on the water-soluble polymer segment include those that are primary (e.g., a primary halo), although leaving groups that are secondary may also be used. Examples of suitable leaving groups include halogens<br>
i<br>
and sulfonate esters. Among the halogens, bromo, chloro, and iodo are preferred, with bromo and chloro being particularly preferred. With respect to sulfonate esters, methanesulfonate (abbreviated "Ms"), trifluoromethanesulfonate, trichloromethanesulfonate, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonate, 2,2,2-trichloroethanesulfonate, nonafluorobutanesulfonate, p-bromobenzenesulfonate, p-nitrobenzenesulfonate, andp-toluenesulfonate are particularly preferred, although other sulfonate esters and similarly constituted leaving groups known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used as well. With respect to the precursor molecule bearing, among other things, a nucleophilic group, the nucleophilic group can be any suitable nucleophilic group that can react with the leaving group(s) associated with water-soluble polymer segment. Typically, the nucleophilic group is alkoxide (R-O~) or thiolate (R-S~), derived from removing the hydrogen from the corresponding alcohol or thiol forms, respectively. Thus, precursor molecules comprising structures corresponding to Formulas Vila and Vllb can be used. As previously indicated, specific examples of alkoxide moieties include the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In a sixth approach for providing a polymeric reagent of the invention, a method is provided comprising the step of reacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide ion or thiolate ion with a precursor molecule comprised of at least one leaving group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal, thereby providing a polymeric reagent.<br>
Conveniently, the water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion is prepared by combining a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one hydroxyl or thiol group in the presence of a suitable base. Thus, the base transforms POLY-OH into POLY-CT and POLY-SH into POLY-S". It is further believed that the water-soluble polymer, now bearing an alkoxide or thiolate moiety, in turn reacts via a Sn2 reaction mechanism with the precursor molecule comprised of a suitable leaving group. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, this approach corresponds to Williamson ether synthesis, and the<br><br>
principles and techniques generally used in a Williamson ether synthesis are applicable here as well.<br>
Nonliniiting examples of bases suitable to form alkoxides and thiolates include sodium, sodium hydroxide, potassium, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate. Preferred bases for use in accordance with this step, however, include those selected from the group consisting of sodium, potassium, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, and potassium tert-butoxide.<br>
In addition, the water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion can conveniently be provided via a polymerization reaction, as previously described. In this approach for providing the water-soluble polymer segment, it is preferred that the water-soluble polymer segment has at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion.<br>
Generally, although not necessarily, an excess of the precursor molecule is allowed to react with the water-soluble polymer bearing at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion. Typically, the amount of the precursor molecule represents at least a molar equivalent to the number available hydroxyl and/or thiolate groups of the water-soluble polymer molecule. Heterofunctional polymer species (i.e., species bearing two or more different terminal functional groups) can be prepared by using nonstoichiometric amounts of the precursor molecule. That is, heterofunctional species are formed when the total number of moles of available hydroxyl or thiolate groups on the water-soluble polymer segment exceeds the total number of moles of the precursor molecule.<br>
A water-soluble polymer segment bearing an alkoxide moiety can be prepared synthetically via a polymerization process. For example, an alkoxide salt such as sodium 2-methoxy ethanolate (NaVOCE^CHaOCHs) can initiate polymerization of ethylene oxide. Assuming that the final monomer added to the polymer chain leaves a reactive group such as an alkoxide (as in the case of ethylene oxide), the polymer chain can then be reacted with the precursor molecule as discussed above.<br><br>
Any water-soluble polymer having at least one hydroxyl or thiol group (to provide, for example, a water-soluble polymer having at least one alkoxide ion or thiolate ion, respectively) can be used. Although water-soluble polymers bearing only a single hydroxyl or thiol can be used, polymers bearing two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve or more hydroxyl and/or thiol moieties can be used. Advantageously, as the number of hydroxyl or thiol moieties on the water-polymer segment increases, the number of available sites for providing ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monthiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal moieties increases. Nonlimiting examples of the upper limit of the number of hydroxyl and/or thiol moieties associated with the water-soluble polymer segment include 500, 100, 80 and 40. IV. CONJUGATES<br>
The polymeric reagents described herein are useful for conjugation to biologically active agents or surfaces. Exemplary groups suited for reaction with the polymeric reagents described herein are primary amine groups (e.g., primary amines from the side chain of a lysine residue), alcohols (e.g., a primary alcohol from the side chain of a serine or threonine residue), hydrazines, and hydrazides. Additional functional groups are reactive with ketones (and related functional groups) and can be employed in conjugation reactions when present on another molecule, e.g., active agent. Such groups suited to react with the polymeric reagents described herein are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the invention provides a method for making a conjugate comprising the step of contacting, under conjugation conditions, an active agent with a polymeric reagent comprising a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. Preferred polymeric reagents used in the conjugation reaction include those described herein (e.g., the polymeric reagents of Formulas I, II, HI, IV, V, and VI).<br>
Suitable conjugation conditions are those conditions of time, temperature, pH, reagent concentration, reagent functional group(s), available functional groups on the active agent, solvent, and the like sufficient to effect conjugation between a<br><br>
polymeric reagent and an active agent. As is known in the art, the specific conditions depend upon, among other things, the active agent, the type of conjugation desired, the presence of other materials in the reaction mixture, and so forth. Sufficient conditions for effecting conjugation in any particular case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the disclosure herein, reference to the relevant literature, and/or through routine experimentation.<br>
Exemplary conjugation conditions include carrying out the conjugation reaction at a pH of from about 4 to about 10, and at, for example, a pH of about 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, or 10.0. The reaction is allowed to proceed from about 5 minutes to about 72 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, and more preferably from about 4 hours to about 24 hours. The temperature under which conjugation can take place is typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0 °C to about 40 °C, and is often at room temperature or less. The conjugation reactions are often carried out using a phosphate buffer solution, sodium acetate, or similar system.<br>
With respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the active agent. In some cases, however, it is preferred to have stoichiometic amounts of reactive groups on the polymeric reagent to the reactive groups of the active agent. Thus, for example, two moles of a polymeric reagent having two ketone groups are combined for every mole of active agent. Exemplary ratios of polymeric reagent to active agent include molar ratios of about 1:1 (polymeric reagent:active agent), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time.<br>
Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product<br>
mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess polymeric reagent, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent), and undesired multi-conjugated species. The'resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for preparing a polymer-active agent conjugate. Any conjugating method that employs a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal can be used. A preferred conjugation approach for preparing polymer-active agent conjugates is reductive amination. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the reductive amination approach is believed to comprise nucleophilic addition of an amine-containing active agent to the functional group of a polymeric reagent, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. With respect to reductive amination, preferred functional groups of the polymeric reagent include ketone, ketone hydrate, hemiketal, and ketal. Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with reductive amination techniques.<br>
Briefly, and without wishing to be bound by theory, an exemplary reductive amination (wherein the active agent bears an amine and the polymeric reagent comprises a ketone) first proceeds via a carbinolamine intermediate. The carbinolamine then dehydrates (condenses) to result in an imine. The imine, in turn, can then be reduced using a suitable reducing agent to form the polymer-active agent conjugate. An exemplary reducing agent is sodium cyano borohydride. In some instances, the reducing agents such as zinc in the presence of HC1, sodium borohydride, iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of alcoholic KOH, hydrogen (Hi) in the presence of a metal catalyst, and formic acid can be used. The reaction is schematically depicted in Figure 3.<br>
Of particular note is the linkage between the active agent and polymeric reagent: the amine of the active agent is attached to a secondary carbon atom of the<br><br>
polymeric reagent. Thus, in another embodiment of the invention, a conjugate is provided comprising a covalent bond between a nitrogen atom of an active agent and a secondary carbon atom derived from the polymeric reagent, A secondary carbon atom is a carbon atom that is directly bonded to two other carbons (represented as R' and R" in Figure 3). With respect to the remaining part of the conjugate, the secondary carbon atom is attached, either directly or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment. Thus, the secondary carbon atom is attached to a first carbon atom (as in R' in Figure 3) and a second carbon atom (as in R" in Figure 3) wherein at least one of the first carbon atom or second carbon atom is attached, either directly or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment.<br>
Depending on the polymeric reagent used to form the conjugate, the atom or atoms attached to the secondary carbon (other than the nitrogen from the active agent), will vary. In some instances, a methyl group is attached to the secondary carbon (i.e., one of the first carbon atom or second carbon atom attached to the secondary carbon atom is methyl). In other instances, a water-soluble polymer segment is attached to each one of the two carbon atoms (i.e., the first carbon atom and second carbon atom attached to the secondary carbon atom) attached to the secondary carbon atom, thereby providing two polymer-containing "arms" connected through the secondary carbon atom. In these instances, the conjugate comprises a second water-soluble polymer segment attached, either directly or though one or more atoms? to the secondary carbon atom. In still other instances, the water-soluble polymeric segment itself may be branched, such when a polymeric reagent shown in Formula V is conjugated to an active agent.<br>
With respect to reductive amination, the conjugates preferably lack a hydroxyl moiety attached to the secondary carbon atom, which can result from direct addition (or "1,2 addition") of a nucleophile to, for example, a carbonyl of an a,p-unsaturated carbonyl. In addition, the conjugates preferably lack a carbonyl attached to a carbon adjacent to the secondary carbon atom (i.e., lacking a carbonyl P to the secondary carbon atom), which can result from conjugate addition (or "1,4 addition").<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, a nitrogen from a primary amine-containing active agent (e.g., the primary amine from a lysine side chain of a protein, the N-terminal amine of a protein, and so forth) was used to form the conjugate. Conjugation via reductive amination can also occur when the active agent comprises a secondary amine. In this case, the resulting conjugate comprises a tertiary amine (derived from the active agent) linked to a secondary carbon (derived from the polymeric reagent).<br>
Other approaches for conjugating the polymeric reagents to active agents can also be used. For example, polymeric reagents having an a,p-unsaturated functional group (e.g., an ct,p-unsaturated ketone) can participate in direct addition, wherein a nucleophile (e.g., amine) can react by nucleophilic addition via direct addition (or "1,2 addition") to the functional group. In addition, these polymeric reagents can participate in conjugate addition (or "1,4 addition"), wherein the nucleophile becomes attached to the P carbon, and the a carbon accepts a proton from the solvent or from the conjugate acid of the nucleophile. The structure of the reagent will largely dictate how the reaction will occur. With an a,P~unsaturated ketone on the vinyl carbons and sterically hindered on the other alpha carbon, conjugate addition (1,4-addition) is expected to prevail.<br>
Regardless of the approach used in their formation, the polymer-active agent conjugates can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Alternatively, and more preferably for lower molecular weight (e.g., less than about 20,000 Dalton, more preferably less than about 10,000 Dalton) polymeric reagents used to form conjugates, the product mixture can be purified to obtain the distribution of water-soluble polymer segments per active agent. For example, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one to five PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein), typically an average of about 3 PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein). The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymeric reagent employed, the particular active agent, the desired dosing regimen, and the residual activity and in vivo properties of the individual conjugate(s).<br><br>
if desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography. That is to say, gel filtration chromatography is used to fractionate differently numbered polymer-to-active agent ratios (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein "1-mer" indicates 1 polymeric reagent to active agent, "2-mer" indicates two polymeric reagents to active agent, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segments). For example, in an exemplary reaction where a 100,000 Dalton protein is randomly conjugated to a ketone-containing PEG having a molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons, the resulting reaction mixture may contain unmodified protein (having a molecular weight of about 100,000 Daltons), monoPEGylated protein (having a molecular weight of about 120,000 Daltons), diPEGylated protein (having a molecular weight of about 140,000 Daltons), and so forth.<br>
While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other polymer-active agent conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment sites within the protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to sepm-ate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) within the active agent.<br>
Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims et al. (1980) Anal. Biochem, 107:60-63). and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
Separation of positional isomers is carried out by reverse phase chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography<br><br>
 (RP-HPLC) CIS column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences.

V. PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.<br>
Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.<br>
A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.<br>
The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.<br>
The preparation can also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Nonlimiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combinations thereof.<br>
An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate,<br><br>
sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.<br>
A surfactant can be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as "Tween 20" and "Tween 80," and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, New Jersey); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.<br>
Acids or bases can be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through<br><br>
routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>
These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients are described in "Remington: The Science &amp; Practice of Pharmacy", 19th ed., Williams &amp; Williams, (1995), the "Physician's Desk Reference", 52nd ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), and Kibbe, A.H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically, although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid solutions or suspensions immediately prior to administration. The pharmaceutical preparation can also take other forms such as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, powders, and the like. Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
As previously described, the conjugates can be administered injected parenterally by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others. VI. METHODS OF ADMINISTERING<br>
The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via<br><br>
injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.00.1 mg to 100 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>
One advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that individual water-soluble polymer portions can be cleaved off. Such a result is advantageous when clearance from the body is potentially a problem because of the polymer size. Optimally, cleavage of each water-soluble polymer portion is facilitated through the use of physiologically cleavable and/or enzymatically degradable linkages such as urethane, amide, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate (via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer portions) can be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type functional group that would provide the desired clearance properties. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group. For<br><br>
example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of polymer derivatives with different polymer weights and cleavable functional groups, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling) by administering the polymer derivative to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified.<br>
It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the preferred specific embodiments thereof, that the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>

Formation of mPEG (2K Da)-2-hydroxypropane<br>
To an azeotropically dried solution of mPEGaicMesylate Nektar Therapeutics, 2 g, 1 mmole) in 50 mL of anhydrous toluene, 1,2-propanediol (1.522 g, 20 mmole) and sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil, 0.800 g, 20 mmole) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours at 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The insoluble precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to dryness. The crude product was dissolved in 3 mL of dichloromethane and precipitated with 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol - diethyl ether (1:1) mixture. The final product was collected using vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 1.4 g. NMR (d6-DMSO): 1.01 ppm (d, -CH3, 3H), 3.24 ppm (s, -OCH3) 3H), 3.51 ppm (s, polymer backbone), 4.54 ppm (d, -OH, 1H).<br>

Next, the solvent was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 20 mL water, the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with 10 % of HsPCU, and the desired product was extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL x 2). The extract was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated under vacuum, and precipitated with 20 ml of a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and diethyl ether (1:1).

Depending on the conditions, the ketone exists in variable amounts of ketone and ketone hydrate. The ketone and ketone hydrate are in equilibrium in the presence of water, both of which can be used (either alone or in combination) to form polymer-active agent conjugates.<br>
PEGylation of lysozyme<br>
Lysozyme (3.0 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and mPEG (2K Da)-methyl ketone (8.4 mg, 20 fold molar excess) was added. After 15 minutes, 0.159 M solution of NaCNBH3 (66 pL, 50 fold molar excess) was then added and the solution was stirred for 17 hours at room temperature. Analysis of the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE showed that PEGylated lysozyme was formed.<br>
This example is repeated several times using different sizes of polymer. First, mPEO mesylate of different sizes are used in place of mPEGaK mesylate to provide a variety of mPEG methyl ketones having different sizes. Specifically, the following different sizes of mPEG mesylate are used: mPEGsK mesylate; mPEGioK mesylate; and mPEG2oK mesylate. Once the mPEG methyl ketones having a variety of different sizes are formed, each is conjugated to lysozyme using the procedure described above. Results similar those obtained for the mPEG2K methyl ketone are obtained.<br><br>

Example 10 Preparation of Polymer-EPO Conjugate-Random PEGylation of EPO<br>
Recombinant erythropoietin, "EPO" (produced in E. coli, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells, or another source) is coupled to mPEG(5K)-methyl ketone (prepared as described in Example 2).<br>
EPO (~2 mg) is dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and rnPEG(5K)~methyl ketone is added at 5X the molar EPO concentration. A reducing agent, NaCNBHs, is added and the solution stirred for 24 hours at room temperature to couple the mPEG(5K)-methyl ketone reagent to the protein via an amine linkage.<br>
The reaction mixture is analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the degree of PEGylation. Confirmation of the degree of PEGylation, 1-mer, 2-mers, etc. is done by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption lonization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The displayed peaks for native and monoPEGylated species differ by approximately 5,000 Daltons. The resulting reaction mixture contains a mixture of native and monoPEGylated protein. Increasing the ratio of PEG reagent to protein increases the degree of polyPEGylation, that is to say, the formation of 2-mers, 3-mers, and so on.<br>
The above demonstrates random PEGylation of an illustrative protein of the invention to yield a distribution of PEGylated EPO products. If desired, the reaction mixture can be further separated to isolate the individual isomers as described below.<br>
PEG conjugates having different molecular weights are separated by gel filtration chromatography. The different PEG conjugates (1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth) are fractionated on the basis of their different molecular weights (in this case, varying by approximately 5,000 Daltons). Specifically, the separation is performed by using a serial column system suitable for effective separation of products in the molecular weight range observed, e.g., a Superdex™200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The products are eluted with 10 ml acetate buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The collected fractions (1 ml) are analyzed by OD at 280 nrn for protein content and also using an iodine test for PEG content (Sims et al.<br><br>
(1980) Anal. Biochem. 107:60-63).  In addition, the results can be visualized by running an SDS PAGE gel, followed by staining with barium iodide. Fractions corresponding to the eluted peaks are collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a membrane, and lyophilized. This method results in separation/purification of conjugates having the same molecular weights but does not provide separation of conjugates having the same molecular weight but different PEGylation sites (i.e., positional isomers).<br>
Separation of positional isomers is carried out by reverse phase chromatography using an RP-HPLC CIS column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac). This procedure is effective for separating PEG-biomolecule isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).  The reverse-phase chromatography is carried out using a RP-HPLC CIS preparative column and eluted with a gradient of water/0.05% TFA (Eluent A) and acetonitrile/0.05% TFA (Eluent B).<br>
Fractions corresponding to the eluted peaks are collected, evaporated to eliminate acetonitrile and TFA, followed by removal of solvent to isolate the individual positional PEG-isomers.<br>

The reaction mixture is analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the degree of PEGylation.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group such as, for example, a ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. In addition, the invention relates to conjugates formed from the attachment of a polymeric reagent described herein to another substance, such as an active agent. Furthermore, the invention relates to methods for synthesizing polymeric reagents, methods for conjugating a polymeric reagent to another substance, compositions comprising the polymeric reagents, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Scientists and clinicians face a number of challenges in their attempts to develop active agents into forms suited for delivery to a patient. Active agents that are polypeptides, for example, are often delivered by injection rather than orally. In this way, the polypeptide is introduced into the systemic circulation without exposure to the proteolytic environment of the stomach. Injection of polypeptides, however, has several drawbacks. For example, many polypeptides have a relatively short half-life, thereby necessitating the need for repeated injections, which are often inconvenient and painful. Moreover, some polypeptides may elicit one or more immune responses with the consequence that the patient's immune system may be activated to degrade or inactivate the polypeptide. Thus, the delivery of polypeptides and other active agents is often problematic even when these agents are administered by injection.<br>
Some success in addressing the problems of delivering active agents via injection has been achieved. For example, conjugating the active agent to a water-soluble polymer has resulted in polymer-active agent conjugates having reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity. In addition, these conjugates often have greatly increased half-lives compared to their unconjugated counterparts as a result of<br><br>
' decreased clearance through the kidney and/or decreased enzymatic degradation in vivo. As a result of having a greater half-life, the conjugate requires less frequent dosing, which* in turn reduces the overall number of painful injections and inconvenient visits to a health care professional. Moreover, active agents that are only marginally soluble often demonstrate a significant increase in water solubility when conjugated to a water-soluble polymer.<br>
Due to its documented safety as well as its approval by the FDA for both topical and internal use, poly(ethylene glycol) has been conjugated to active agents. When an active agent is conjugated to a polymer of poly(ethylene glycol) or "PEG", the conjugated active agent is conventionally referred to as having been "PEGylated." The commercial success of PEGylated active agents attests to their value. Exemplary commercially available PEGylated polypeptides include PEGASYS® PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ), PEG-INTRON® PEGylated interferon alpha-2b (Schering Corp., Kennilworth, NJ), SOMAVERT® PEGylated human growth hormone receptor antagonist, and NEULASTA® PEG-filgrastim (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA). PEGylated small molecules such as distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Zalipsky (1993) Bioconjug. Cliem. 4(4):296-299) and fluorouracil (Ouchi et al. (1992) Drug Des. £&gt;«cov.9(l):93-105) have also been prepared.<br>
Despite these successes, conjugation of a polymer to an active agent remains challenging. In particular, the conjugation reaction is relatively imprecise in that a relatively disperse mixture of products results. For example, the conjugation reaction often results in a mixture of singly substituted, disubstituted, and polysubstituted conjugate forms. Moreover, the possible number of different conjugate forms increases inasmuch as different attachment sites of an active agent can result in different arrangements of attachments. For example, a singly substituted active agent having three different sites for attachment to a polymer can have three different forms: each form having the single polymer attached to one of the three different attachment sites. Recognizing that each conjugate form can have a unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile only serves to underscore the complexity associated with providing polymer-active agent conjugates that are suited for use as therapeutic agents. Thus, there is a desire to provide polymeric<br><br>
reagents that are "site-directed" so that the desired conjugates can be more predictably formed.<br>
Some- degree of selectivity in the conjugation reaction is achieved based on the presence of the particular functional group present on the polymeric reagent. For example, poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives bearing an aldehyde derivative (shown below) undergo reductive amination reactions with primary amines of, for example, a polypeptide.<br>
a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative bearing an aldehyde derivative wherein (n) represents the number of repeating ethylene oxide units<br>
As a consequence, a degree of selectivity is achieved in that conjugation typically occurs only between the relatively reactive and readily accessible primary amine groups of the polypeptide and the aldehyde of the polymeric reagent. For polypeptides having many relatively reactive primary amine groups (e.g., a polypeptide having many primary amine-containing lysine residues), however, the conjugation reaction nonetheless results in a relatively polydisperse mixture of conjugate forms.<br>
In order to provide an alternative to polymeric reagents bearing aldehyde derivatives, the present invention provides polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group (e.g., a ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal).<br>
Others have described polymers comprising a ketone or a related functional group for use in variety of contexts. Typically, however, the described polymers are unsuited for conjugation.<br>
For example, WO 96/33156 describes poly(alkylene glycol) derivatives of benzophenone and related aromatic moieties. The derivatives are described as being useful as photoinitiators. Aromatic rings, however, are preferably absent in polymeric reagents useful for conjugation to an active agent because the hydrophobic nature of aromatic moieties undesirably decreases aqueous solubility.<br><br>
In addition, aromatic rings contained in a conjugate may be metabolized in vivo into arene oxide intermediates, which can covalently bind with nucleophilic groups present on prpteins, DNA and RNA, thereby leading to cellular toxicity. See Daly et al. (1979) Experientia 28(10):! 129-1149.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,149,806 describes a carbon acid useful as a Michael donor. One of the described structures is provided below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Even if structures like these could be used for conjugation reactions, the propylene oxide polymers are not suitably water-soluble to provide a conjugate acceptable for in vivo administration.<br>
Other previously described polymeric reagents suffer from similar deficiencies.<br>
Thus, there remains a need in the art to provide polymeric reagents that are useful for providing, among other things, conjugates with other substances. The present invention addresses this and other needs in the art by providing, inter alia, novel polymeric reagents comprising a ketone or a related functional group (e.g., a ketone hydrate, thione, rhonothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I.       DEFINITIONS AND OVER VIEW<br>
Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular polymers, synthetic techniques, active agents, and the like, as such may vary.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "polymeric reagent" includes a single polymeric reagent as well as two or more of the same or different polymeric reagents, reference to a "conjugate" includes a single conjugate as well as two or more of the same of different conjugates, reference to an "excipient" includes a single excipient as well as two or more of the same or different excipients, and the like.<br>
In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.<br>
"PEG," "polyethylene glycol" and "poly(ethylene glycol)" as used herein, are meant to encompass any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure "-O(CH2CH2O)m-" where (m) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes "-CH2CH2-O(CH2CH2O)m-CH2CH2-" and "-(CH2CH2O)m-," depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. When the PEG further comprises a spacer moiety (to be described in greater detail below), the atoms comprising the spacer moiety, when covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer segment, do not result in the formation of an oxygen-oxygen bond (i.e., an "-O-O-rt or peroxide linkage). Throughout the specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term "PEG" includes structures having various terminal or<br><br>
"end capping" groups and so forth. The term "PEG" also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of -CEkCHaO- repeating subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as "branched," "linear," "forked," "multifunctional," and the like, to be described in greater detail below.<br>
The terms "end-capped" and "terminally capped" are interchangeably used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C|_2o alkoxy group, more preferably a Q.io alkoxy group, and more preferably a C\.$ alkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled to can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties (such as the ability to form organized structures with similarly end-capped polymers) are imparted to the polymer. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of di lauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br><br>
"Non-naturally occurring" means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer may, however, contain one or more subunits-or segments of subunits that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.<br>
The term "water soluble" as in a "water-soluble polymer segment" and "water-soluble polymer" is any segment or polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer or segment will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of light, transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer or segment thereof will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer or segment is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.<br>
"Nominal average molecular weight" in the context of a water-soluble, non-naturally occurring polymer of the invention such as PEG, refers to the mass average molecular weight of the polymer, typically determined by size exclusion chromatography, light scattering techniques, or intrinsic velocity determination in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse, possessing low polydispersity values of preferably less than about 1.2, more preferably less than about 1.15, still more preferably less than about 1.10, yet still more preferably less than about 1.05, and most preferably less than about 1.03.<br>
"Thiol derivative," in the context of a water-soluble, non-naturally occurring water soluble polymer, means such a polymer having at least one terminus that is a thiol group (-SH), a thiolate (-S") or a protected thiol, that is to say, a thiol group in its protected form. Typical thiol protecting groups include thioether, thioester, or disulfide. Exemplary protecting groups for thiols can be found in Greene, T., and Wuts, Peter G.M., "PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS," Chapter 6, 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
The terms "active" and "activated" when used in conjunction with a particular functional group, refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily<br><br>
with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "nonreactive" or "inert" group).<br>
The terms "protected," "protecting group" and "protective group" refer to the presence of a moiety (i.e., the protecting group) that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule, if any. Protecting groups known in the art can be found in Greene, T.W., et al, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS. 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY (1999).<br>
As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is meant to encompass protected forms thereof.<br>
An "organic radical," in the context describing a structure, a structural formula, a molecule, and so forth, refers to a carbon-containing moiety wherein a carbon atom provides a point of attachment. Exemplary organic radicals include, alkyl (e.g., lower alkyl), substituted alkyl (including heteroalkyl, and chain-substituted heteroalkyl), alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heterocyclicyl, substituted heterocyclicyl, and so forth.<br>
A "nonaromatic-containing organic radical," in the context of describing a structure, a structural formula, a molecule, and so forth, refers to any "organic radical," as described above but excluding aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, and alkyl or other groups that contain any aromatic group, e.g., aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, and the like.<br>
"Alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon chain, typically ranging from about 1 to 15 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbon chains are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 1-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, "alkyl" includes cycloalkyl as well as cycloalkylene-containing alkyl.<br><br>

Aryl rings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, "aryl" includes heteroaryl.<br>
"Heteroaryl" is an aryl group containing from one to four heteroatoms, wherein each heteroatomin the heteroaryl ring is preferably a sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.<br>
"Heterocyclicyl" or "heterocyclic" means a group of one or more rings of 5-12 atoms, preferably 5-7 atoms, with or without unsaturation or aromatic character and having at least one ring atom which is not a carbon. Preferred heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.<br>
The term "substituted" as in, for example, "substituted alkyl," refers to a moiety (e.g., an alkyl group) substituted with one or more non-interfering<br><br>
substituents, such as, but not limited to: C3.s cycloalkyl, e.g., cyclopropyl,    , cyclobutyl, and the like; halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, andiodo; cyano; alkoxy; lower phenyl; substituted phenyl; and the like.

"Nucleophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may be ionic having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an electrophilic center or with an electrophile.<br>
A "physiologically cleavable" or "hydrolyzable" or "degradable" bond is a relatively weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. Preferred are bonds that have a hydrolysis half-life at pH 8 and 25 °C of less than about 30 minutes.  The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include, but are not limited to, carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, and oligonucleotide bonds.<br>
An "enzymatically degradable linkage" means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes.<br>
A "hydrolytically stable" linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages<br><br>
include, but are not limited to, the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic<br>
chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable<br>
linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day<br>
under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds<br>
can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.	<br>
"Active agent," as described herein, includes any agent, drug, compound, composition of matter, or mixture that provides some pharmacologic, often beneficial, effect that can be demonstrated in-vivo or in vitro. This includes foods, food supplements, peptides, nutrients, nutriceuticals, drugs, vaccines, antibodies, vitamins, and other beneficial agents. As used herein, these terms further include any physiologically or pharmacologically active substance that produces a localized or systemic effect in a patient.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier" refers to an excipient that may optionally be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse lexicological effects to thepatient. "Pharmacologically effective amount," "physiologically effective amount," and "therapeutically effective amount" are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a polymer-active agent conjugate that is needed to provide a desired level of active agent in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular drug or therapeutic agent, the components and physical characteristics of the therapeutic composition, intended patient population, individual patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein.<br>
"Multi-functional" means a polymer having 3 or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or different. Multifunctional polymeric reagents of the invention will typically contain from about 3-100 functional groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25 functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from 3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3,4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups within the polymer backbone.<br>
A basic or acidic reactant described herein includes neutral, charged, and any corresponding salt forms thereof.<br><br>
The term "patient," refers to a living organism suffering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of an active agent, and includes both humans and animals.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
The polymeric reagents described herein comprise a water-soluble polymer segment and a functional group. The functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. The functional group can be attached to the water-soluble polymer segment through a through a direct covalent bond. More typically, however, the functional group is attached to the water-soluble polymer segment through one or more atoms. Thus, in its most elemental form, the polymeric reagents described herein all share a core structure comprising:<br>
POLY	FG<br>
wherein POLY is a water-soluble polymer segment, FG is a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal, and the dashed line represents a direct covalent bond or one or more atoms serving to attach the functional group to the water-soluble polymer segment. As will be seen in more detail below, the polymeric reagents described herein can have more complex structures.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is-believed that polymeric reagents bearing a ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, or dithioketal are more selective for use in conjugating to another substance (e.g., active agent) than a polymer bearing, for example, an aldehyde. One factor contributing to the increased selectivity of the polymeric reagents described herein is the relative stability associated with the functional group(s). As a result of being more stable,<br><br>
the functional group(s) of the polymeric reagent tend to only react with relatively more reactive moieties, thereby providing a greater degree of selectivity.<br>
The ihcreased stability of ketones, ketone hydrates, thiones, monothiohydrates, dithiohydrates, hemiketals, monothiohemiketals, dithiohemiketals, ketals, and dithioketals compared to other functional groups such as aldehydes is believed to be a function of two effects: electronic effects and steric effects. With respect to electronic effects, crowding at the functional group effectively provides the ability of the functional group to "share" the burden any ionization or "excess charge" that may occur during a reaction. Thus, for example, a ketone —having two carbon atoms attached on either side of a carbonyl carbon-can better absorb the electron-rich environment associated with a carbonyl moiety than the corresponding aldehyde, which has only one carbon.<br>
With respect to steric effects, nucleophilc addition to the carbonyl group of both aldehydes and ketones changes the carbonyl carbon from sp2 hybridization to sp3 hybridization. The presence of a second — and relatively large — carbon atom associated with a ketone, however, slows the approach of the relatively bulky active agent to the sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon and sterically crowds the forming sp3 hybridized carbon much more than the relatively small hydrogen associated with an<br>
aldehyde. As a consequence, the combination of both electronic and steric effects increases the activation energy of ketones and related functional groups by decreasing their starting energy state (i.e., by providing a stabilized carbonyl carbon, an electronic effect) and raising the energy of the transition state (i.e., the change from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, a steric effect). Thus, ketones and related functional groups are relatively more stable and hence less reactive.<br>
Surprisingly, however, it has been found that the increased stability of ketone-, ketone hydrate-, thione-, monothiohydrate-, dithiohydrate-, hemiketal-, monothiohemiketal-, dithiohemiketal-, ketal-, or dithioketal-bearing polymeric reagents is advantageous. For example, an active agent may have several amine groups, each having its own reactivity toward a carbonyl moiety present on a polymeric reagent. By providing a relatively less reactive ketone-bearing polymeric reagent, conjugation will occur more preferentially between the least<br><br>
sterically hindered and most reactive amine(s) on the active agent and the carbonyl moiety of the ketone, thereby reducing the number of different conjugate forms.<br>
Another advantage of the polymeric reagents described herein is that the functional group can be between two polymer chains (which may be linear), thereby providing the ability to attach two polymer chains through a single atom that is directly attached to an active agent, surface, or other moiety. Previously described branched polymeric reagents comprise a spacer moiety having a reactive group (e.g., aldehyde) for conjugation and separate and distinct branching atom that serves to link two polymer chains. In this way, the water-soluble polymer segments can be brought relatively closer to the active agent, thereby decreasing or eliminating entirely small "pendent" groups left behind on an active agent when a water-soluble polymer segment is cleaved from the conjugate, n.      FEATURES OF THE POLYMERIC REAGENTS<br>
A. The Functional Group ("FG")<br>
As previously stated, the polymeric reagents of the invention are associated with a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. Structurally, each functional group ("FG") is shown below. In the structures, R stands for an organic radical, e.g., alkyl, and the "functional group carbon" is designated with an asterisk.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Although not shown, a carbon atom must be attached on each side of the functional group carbon in order to provide the named functional group.<br>
Advantageously, the described functional groups are often easily transformed into each other. Thus, for example, some or all of a ketone can be transformed into a ketone hydrate by the addition of water. Moreover, in the presence of water, a ketone generally exists in an equilibrium with the corresponding hydrate. This is especially true with ketones having a proximate electron-withdrawing group. Because of equilibrium, as the amount of water in a ketone-containing system is decreased, the amount of the ketone hydrate species decreases. Thus, by controlling the amount of water in the system, it is possible to influence the amount (or ratio) of the two forms (e.g., ketone and ketone hydrate). Other factors, such as the presence or absence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups and proximal steric hindrance, also influence the amount of and ratio between the two forms. Thione and monothiohydrate forms can also be provided in a similar fashion.<br>
Usefully, conjugation reactions employing the presently described polymeric reagents can often proceed without regard-to controlling the specific solvation status of the functional group. For example, it makes no difference whether the predominating species of the polymeric reagent is a ketone or a ketone hydrate; using one, the other, or both under conjugation conditions will result in the formation of polymer-active agent conjugates. While not wishing to be bound by theory, ketone hydrates - - in equilibrium with the corresponding ketone - - can be used because as the ketone species is being depleted during the conjugation reaction with the active agent, the equilibrium causes additional ketone hydrate species to be transformed into the corresponding ketone. The series of reactions is depicted in Figure 1. As shown therein, two equilibria reactions are involved: the equilibria between the ketone and ketone hydrate in a polymeric reagent and the condensation processes involving an amine group on an active agent to form the carbinolamine and corresponding imine. Thus, while conjugation may proceed via the ketone, use of the corresponding ketone hydrate form will also result in formation of the desired conjugate. Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that increased stability of the hydrate form (as compared to the corresponding ketone<br><br>
form) corresponds to increased reactivity of the ketone form to conjugation to an active agent.<br>
. In addition, ketones can be converted into hemiketals through the addition of an alcohol. Again, as the amount of alcohol to a ketone-containing system is decreased, the amount of hemiketal species decreases. In this way, in equilibria reactions similar to those discussed above, it is possible to provide a hemiketal by adding alcohol to a ketone-containing system and providing a ketone by removing alcohol from a hemiketal-containing system. Moreover, in the presence of an acid catalyst, additional quantities of alcohol will transform a hemiketal into a ketal. In addition, ketones can be directly transformed into ketals by the addition of a diol, e.g., HO-CEbCHa-OH, in the presence of an acid catalyst. Advantageously, these and other ketals often serve as ketone protecting groups.<br>
Figure 2 schematically depicts the formation of a ketal from a polymeric reagent bearing a ketone functional group, and of a conjugate from a polymeric reagent bearing a ketal functional group. In Figure 2, a polymeric reagent bearing a ketone functional group can be initially converted into a reactive hemiketal intermediate, and then into the ketal (in this Figure, a dimethyl ketal). Figure 2 also illustrates, through a series of equilibria, how ketals can be utilized directly in conjugation reactions with an amine-containing active agent.<br>
In a similar way, thiones can be transformed into dithiohydrates (sometimes referred to as dithiosolvates) by solvating the thione in a sulfur-containing (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) environment. Thiones can also be transformed into dithiohemiketals in the presence of thiols, and into dithioketals in the presence of excess thiol. In a way analgous to ketones, thiones can be directly transformed into dithioketals by the addition of a dithiol, e.g., HS-CH2CH2-SH. Dithioketals often serve as thione protecting groups as well.<br>
Although exemplary methods for transforming a given functional group into another functional group have been provided, the polymeric reagents are not limited in the manner in which the functional group is formed. Those of ordinary skill in the art know of other approaches for providing the functional groups described herein. Moreover, reference to any given functional group encompasses both the functional group per se, as well as to protected forms of the functional group.<br><br>
B. The Water-Soluble Polymer Segment ("POLY," e.g., "POLY1," "POLY2," etc.)<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention also comprise at least one water-soluble polymer segment. Water-soluble polymer segments that are nonpeptidic and water-soluble, with from 2 to about 300 termini, are particularly useful in the invention. Examples of suitable water-soluble polymer segments include, but are not limited to, poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG"), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol having water-solubility, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,384, and copolymers, terpolymers, and mixtures thereof. For purposes of the present invention, poly(propylene glycol) has insufficient water-solubility to act as a water-soluble polymer segment. Consequently, it is preferred that water-soluble polymer segments described herein do not contain propylene monomers.<br>
It is preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer segment is preferably, although not necessarily, a poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG") or a derivative thereof. It should be understood, however, that related polymers are also suited for use in the practice of this invention and that the use of the term "PEG" or "poly(ethylene glycol)" is intended to be inclusive and not exclusive in this respect. Consequently, the term "PEG" includes poly(ethylene glycol) in any of its linear, branched or multi-arm forms, including alkoxy PEG, bifunctional PEG, forked PEG, branched PEG, pendant PEG, or PEG with degradable linkages therein, to be more fully described below.<br>
In one form useful in the present invention, free or nonbound PEG is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups:<br>
HO-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH2O)m.-CH2CH2-OH (m1) typically ranges from zero to about 4,000.<br>
The above polymer, alpha-, omega-dihydroxylpoly(ethylene glycol), can be represented in brief form as HO-PEG-OH where it is understood that the -PEG-symbol can represent the following structural unit:<br><br>
-CH2CH20-(CH2CH20)ra.-CH2CH2-where (m1) is as defined as above.<br>
Another type of PEG useful in the present invention is methoxy-PEG-OH, or mPEG in brief, in which one terminus is the relatively inert methoxy group, while the other terminus is a hydroxyl group. The structure of mPEG is given below.<br>
CH3O-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH20)m
Multi-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, can also be used as the PEG polymer. For example, PEG can have the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
polya and polyb are PEG backbones (either the same or different), such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol);<br>
R" is a nonreactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and<br>
P and Q are nonreactive linkages. In a preferred embodiment, the branched PEG polymer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) disubstituted lysine.<br>
These polymers may be linear, or may be in any of the above-described'" forms (e.g., branched, forked, and the like).<br>
In addition, the PEG can comprise a forked PEG. An example of a forked PEG is represented by the following structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein: X is a spacer moiety and each Z is an activated terminal group linked to CH by a chain of atoms of defined length. International Application No. PCT/US99/05333, discloses various forked PEG structures capable of use in the<br><br>
present invention. The chain of atoms linking the Z functional groups to the branching carbon atom serve as a tethering group and may comprise, for example, alkyl chains,'ether chains, ester chains, amide chains and combinations thereof.<br>
The PEG polymer may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having reactive groups, such as carboxyl, covalently attached along the length of the PEG rather than at the end of the PEG chain. The pendant reactive groups can be attached to the PEG directly or through a spacer moiety, such as an alkylene group.<br>
In addition to the above-described forms of PEG, the polymer can also be prepared with one or more weak or degradable linkages in the polymer, including any of the above described polymers. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight:<br>
-PEG-CO2-PEG- + H2O  	*• -PEG-CO2H + HO-PEG-<br>
Other hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful as a degradable linkage within a polymer backbone, include: carbonate linkages; imine linkages resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al. (1997) Polymer Preprints 38(l):582-3); phosphate ester linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are typically formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are typically formed by reaction between an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester linkages that are, for example, formed by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; amide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of another PEG chain; urethane linkages formed from reaction of, e.g., a PEG with a terminal isocyanate group and a PEG alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of a peptide; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by, for example, a phosphoramidite group, e.g., at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.<br>
It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the term poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the above forms of PEG.<br><br>

It is understood that the maximum limit of molecular weight for any given water-soluble polymer segment useful herein is less than about 300,000 Daltons.<br>
The nominal average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segment can also be expressed as being a value within a range of nominal average molecular weights. Exemplary ranges include: from about 100 Daltons to about 100,000 Daltons; from about 500 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons; from about<br>
v<br>
1,000 Daltons to about 50,000 Daltons; from about 2,000 Daltons to about 25,000 Daltons; and from about 5,000 Daltons to about 20,000 Daltons.<br>
Exemplary nominal average molecular weights for the. water-soluble polymer segment include about 100 Daltons, about 200 Daltons, about 300 Daltons, about 400 Daltons, about 500 Daltons, about 600 Daltons, about 700 Daltons, about 750 Daltons, about 800 Daltons, about 900 Daltons, about 1,000 Daltons, about 2,000 Daltons, about 2,200 Daltons, about 2,500 Daltons, about 3,000 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,400 Daltons, about 5,000 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 8,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 13,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons, about 15,000 Daltons, about 20,000 Daltons, about 22,500 Daltons, about 25,000 Daltons, about 30,000 Daltons, about<br><br>
40,000 Daltons, about 50,000 Daltons, about 60,000 Daltons, and about 75,000 Daltons.<br>
With'respect to PEG, wherein a structure corresponding to<br>
i<br>
"-CH2CH2O-(CH2CH2O)m-CH2CH2-" can be provided, preferred values for (m) include: from about 3 to about 3,000; from about 10 to about 3,000; from about 15 to about 3,000; from about 20 to about 3,000; from about 25 to about 3,000; from about 30 to about 3,000; from about 40 to about 3,000; from about 50 to about 3,000; from about 55 to about 3,000; from about 75 to about 3,000; from about 100 to about 3,000; and from about 225 to about 3,000.<br>
As used herein, the term "water-soluble polymer segment" includes those water-soluble polymer segments that are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic and specifically excludes any water-soluble polymer segments that are not biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. With respect to biocompatibility, a substance is considered biocompatible if the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., active agent) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. With respect to non-immunogenicity, a substance is considered nonimmunogenic if the intended use of the substance in vivo does not produce an undesired immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. It is particularly preferred that the water-soluble polymer segments described herein as well as conjugates are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. As used herein, the term "water-soluble polymer segment" also excludes those water-soluble polymer segments made of monomers comprising one or more ketone moieties.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing discussion concerning substantially water-soluble polymer segments is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated. As used herein, the term "polymeric reagent" generally refers to an entire molecule, which can comprise a water-soluble polymer segment and a functional group. The term "water-soluble polymer segment" is generally reserved for use in discussing one portion of a larger<br><br>
molecular structure such as a polymeric reagent, precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth.<br>
C. Attachment Through One or More Atoms<br>
Each portion (e.g., functional group, active agent, water-soluble polymer segment, and so forth) of the polymeric reagent and other structures described herein can be directly attached to each other via a direct covalent bond. More typically, however, each portion is attached through one or more atoms serving to tether each portion together into a unified whole.<br>
Preferred atoms through which the various portions of the polymeric reagents and other structures described herein include a chain of atoms made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur atoms. Attached to this chain of atoms, can be one or more other atoms such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen. The chain can be short and comprise as few as a chain of two to five atoms. Longer chains, for example, a chain of atoms of ten, fifteen, or more in length are also contemplated. Thus, a great number of different combinations of atoms are possible for attaching portions of the molecules described herein. Typically, however, three different groups of atoms are associated with linking the various portions of the polymeric reagents and other molecules described herein: a carbon chain; an electron withdrawing group; and a spacer moiety. Each will be discussed in turn.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (i)       The Carbon Chain, (e.g., Optionally, one or more carbon chains is included in the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugates, precursor molecules to form the polymeric reagents, and so forth). Typically, but not necessarily, the carbon chain is located immediately adjacent to the functional group of the polymeric reagent. Notwithstanding the absence of a carbon chain, however, a carbon atom (from, for example, a spacer moiety, organic radical, electron-withdraing group, and so forth) must be attached on each side of the functional group carbon.<br><br>
When present, the carbon chain can have any number of carbon atoms so long as the overall polymeric reagent remains water soluble. Typically, however, there will be'l, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, or 7 carbons in the carbon chain. Preferably, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth) will lack a hydrocarbon chain of 8 carbons or greater. Thus, with respect to the various carbon chains structurally defined herein, each of (z), (y), and (x) can independently be zero, a positive integer, such as 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, and 7, a positive integer from 1 to 7, a positive integer from 2 to 7, and so forth.<br>
Due to its tetravalent character, each carbon in the carbon chain has two groups attached to it. As structurally defined herein, these groups have been designated as R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9.   Each of these groups, when present, is independently either hydrogen or an organic radical. A preferred form includes each occurrence of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9, when present, as hydrogen.<br>
Exemplary classes of moieties from which any of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can independently be chosen from include H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, and substituted aryl. Although, as further explained below, aromatic moieties are preferably absent. Specific moieties from which any of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can independently be chosen from include H, methyl, ethyl, »-propyl, isopropyl, /z-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, and vinyl. In addition, and two of R2, R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 can be joined to form a cyclic ring system, which may bridge certain carbon chain atoms.<br>
Another exemplary form includes defining the carbon chain as having an organic radical (e.g., a lower alkyl) attached to the carbon in the chain a to the functional group carbon. Advantageously, the presence of such an organic group in this position increases the selectivity of the polymeric reagent. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the steric effects of the organic radical further increases the activation energy necessary for the functional group to react. An exemplary carbon chain (attached to a ketone having a terminal methyl group) showing the a carbon and a p carbon is provided below, wherein a methyl group is attached to the a carbon and all other substituents in the carbon chain are hydrogen.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Preferably, when an organic radical is attached to a carbon a to the functional group carbon, the atom p to the functional group carbon is or is part of an electron-withdrawing group. Thus, exemplary arrangements are provided below wherein an oxygen atom is used as the electron-withdrawing group<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Although the above structures use oxygen as an electron-withdrawing group, electron-withdrawing groups other than oxygen (e.g., carbonyl) can be used.<br>
When the carbon a to the functional group carbon bears an organic radical (e.g., methyl), the resulting polymeric reagent may comprise a chiral center. Specific chirality, however, is not explicitly illustrated herein with respect to any compound or structure comprising one or more chiral centers. Thus, the present discussion encompasses both the isomerically pure forms of any optically active<br><br>
corapound described herein, as well as enantiomeric mixtures, including a racemic mixture, thereof.<br>
Optionally, when two or more carbons are in the carbon chain, the carbon chain can include a carbon-carbon double bond. Such unsaturated groups can offer additional possibilities for reactions, such as the ability of the polymeric reagents to provide conjugate addition of a nucleophile to the p carbon of an a-p unsaturated ketone, as shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
An a-p unsaturated ketone is often called an enone. Thus, while one or more carbon-carbon double bonds can be included at any position of the carbon chain, it is preferred that when a double bond is present, the double bond is located between the terminal a and p carbons relative to the functional group carbon (e.g., the carbonyl carbon). As will be discussed below, however, enones may preferably be absent from the polymeric reagents described herein.<br>
(ii)      The Electron Withdrawing Groups ("EW,"e.g., "EW1," "EW2," "EW3," etc.)<br>
An electron-withdrawing group is optionally located within the polymeric reagent (or corresponding precursor molecule, conjugate, and so forth) and can comprise the atoms that serve to link various portions of a larger molecule together. An electron-withdrawing group is any atom or group of atoms including electronegative atom(s) and in some cases, having resonance interactions among some of the atoms in the electron-withdrawing group that create an enhanced electron-withdrawing effect. Electrons are attracted to the electronegative atom(s) of the electron-withdrawing group, thereby influencing the chemistry of a nearby functional group. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group adjacent (i.e.,<br><br>
"ct") to or within two to six atoms distant from the functional group carbon effectively destabilizes this carbon by withdrawing electrons, thereby increasing the overall reactivity of the functional group. Thus, for example, the presence of an electron-withdrawing group near a ketone group will increase its reactivity toward amines in a reductive animation reaction and other reactions wherein nucleophilic addition takes place.<br>
It is preferred, however, that the presence and/or location of the electron-withdrawing group does not render the functional group overly reactive, thereby frustrating the ability to provide relative selectivity during, for example, conjugation reactions. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether any given electron-withdrawing group as well as whether the location of the electron-withdrawing group renders the functional group overly reactive. For example, conjugation techniques discussed herein can be performed using different polymeric reagents, each having a"different electron-withdrawing group and/or an electron-withdrawing group at different distances from the functional group carbon. Those polymeric reagents providing desired reactivities as evidence through, for example, single conjugation to a protein, are not overly reactive.<br>
Any electron-withdrawing group can be included and the invention is not limited in this regard. Generically, electron-withdrawing groups include -O-, -NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-NH-, -NH-OC(O)-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxyl substituent. With respect to the structures then, electron-withdrawing groups designated as "EW1" are preferably selected from the group consisting of -O-, -NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(0)-NH-, -NH-OC(O)-, -C(O)-, -C(S)-, and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxyl substituent, while electron-withdrawing groups designated as "EW2" and "EW3" are each preferably independently selected from the group consisting of -0-, -NH-, -C(O)NH-, -NHC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O&gt;, -NH-OC(O)-, -OC(O)-NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and -C(OR)H-, wherein OR is an alkoxy or hydroxy substituent. A preferred electron-withdrawing group is -C(O)-, either alone or as part of amide or carbamate. A particularly preferred electron-withdrawing group is -O-.<br><br>
(iii)     The Spacer Moiety ("X," e.g., "X1," "X2," "X3, "X4", "X5," etc.)<br>
' Optionally, the polymeric reagents provided herein (as well as the corresponding precursor molecules, conjugates, and so forth) include a spacer moiety. Exemplary moieties suited for any spacer moiety designated as X1 and X4 are those independently selected from the group consisting of-O-, -S-, -C(O)-, -O-C(O)-, -C(O)-0-, -C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-NH-, -O-C(O)-NH-, -C(S&gt;, -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -CH2-O-, -0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-, -O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-, -0-CHrCH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-0-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-0-CH2-, -C(O)-O-CH2-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-,-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -0-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -O-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -NH-CH2-, -NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -0-C(0)-NH-[CH2]o-6-(OCH2CH2)o-2-,-C(0)-NH-(CH2)i.6-NH-C(0)-, -NH-C(0)-NH-(CH2),.6-NH-C(0)-, -O-C(O)-CH2-, -O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, and -O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-. Exemplary moieties suited for any spacer moiety<br><br>
designated as X2, X3, and X5 include those independently selected from the group consisting of-O-, -S-, -C(O)-, -O-C(O)-, -C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-0», -C(S)-, -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CHr, ~0-CHr&gt; -CH2-0-, -0-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-, -O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-O-, -0-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-0-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-.NH-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-,-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-,-CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-, -NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-,CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-)-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-O-C(O)-, -CH2-O-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-O-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-CH2-, -C(O)-NH-C1I2-CH2-, -CH2-NH-C(O)-O-, -CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-O-, -CHrCHrCHrNH-C(O)-O-, -CH2-NH-, -CH2-CH2-NH-, -CH2-NH-CH2-, -CH2-NH-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-, -CH2-C(O)-CH2-, -CH2-C(0)-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -C(O)-CH2-CH2-, -NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, ~C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(0)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-C(0)-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -(CH2CH20)o-2-(CH2)o-6-NH-C(O)-0-,-C(O)-NH-(CH2)i.6-NH-C(O)-) -C(O)-NH-(CH2);.6-NH-C(O)-NH-, -CH2-C(O)-O-, -CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-, and -CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-.<br>
In any of the above, a simple cycloalkylene group, e.g., 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexylene, may replace any two, three, or four carbon alkylene group.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, however, a series of atoms is not a spacer moiety when the series of atoms is immediately adjacent to a water-soluble polymer segment and the series of atoms is but another monomer, such that the<br><br>
proposed spacer moiety would represent a mere extension of the polymer chain. For example, given the partial structure "POLY-X-," and POLY is defined as "CH3O(eH2CH2O)m-" wherein (m) is 2 to 4000 and X is defined as a spacer moiety, the spacer moiety cannot be defined as "-CEkCHaO-" since such a definition would merely represent an extension of the polymer. In such a case, however, an acceptable spacer moiety could be defined as "-CHaCEb-."<br>
D. Other Features<br>
In addition to those features already described, the polymeric reagents (and corresponding precursor molecules and conjugates) can have other optional features.<br>
For example, the entire polymeric reagent (as well as the organic radicals present in the polymeric reagent) preferably lacks an aromatic moiety. As used herein, an entity lacks an aromatic moiety when the entity is completely free of a conjugated system of n electrons that closes upon itself. Typical of aromatic<br>
moieties are those that comprise a benzene,"\=/," structure. The presence of an aromatic structure is undesired because such structures decrease water solubility and can result in harmful effects in vivo. For the same reasons, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack halogen atoms (e.g., F, Cl, Br and I) in their structures. The presence of either halogen atoms or aromatic moieties can be warranted in certain circumstances, however, such as in a method for making a polymeric reagent wherein protection groups include aromatic or halogen atoms. In addition, ionized forms of halogens can also be useful to form salts, which are not typically harmful in moderate amounts. As used herein, a polymeric reagent lacking a halogen atom does not include instances wherein the polymeric reagent (or conjugate formed therefrom) is in a salt form having a halogen counterion.<br>
In addition, the polymeric reagents preferably lack a cyclic dienone. As used herein, a cyclic dienone is a ketone wherein the carbonyl carbon is part of a cyclic structure and the a,P carbons on either side of the carbonyl carbon are have a double bond. Schematically, the core structure of cyclic dienones can be generically represented as:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
Exemplary cyclic dienones lacking in the polymeric reagents include the <br>
following:   O   ;    0   ;      ^-^      ; and      ^^^       . It is believed that the presence of such doubly a,|3-unsaturated structures in a polymeric reagent may result in conjugate addition of a nucleophile. This approach to conjugation may not, however, have the same selectivity as, for example, reductive amination through a ketone. Consequently, the polymeric reagents preferably lack cyclic dienones. Moreover, it can also be the case that the polymeric reagents also lack an enone (i.e., an a,p~unsaturated ketone). When, however, an alternative conjugation approach is desired, an enone can be present.<br>
In addition, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack other reactive groups that could impede the selectivity. For example, the polymeric reagents preferably lack a terminal oxylamine group (i.e., -ONHa). In addition, the polymeric reagents also preferably lack a terminal hydrazine group (i.e., -NHNHz).<br>
In some cases, the polymeric reagents of the invention are not in certain forms. Thus, for example, the polymeric reagents are not in the following forms:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and ketal derivatives of any of the foregoing. It will be understood that "mw" refers to the weight average molecular weight of the ethylene oxide moiety, and that a range such as "1-50" provided adjacent to a monomer indicates that the moiety encompasses the monomer repeating from 1 to 50 times, inclusive.<br><br>
E. Structurally Defined Polymeric Reagents<br>
As will be described in further detail below, the polymeric reagents of the invention'can be provided in a number of forms.<br>
In some instances, the polymeric reagent is linear in form and comprises a single water-soluble polymer segment and a single functional group. An exemplary polymeric reagent of this form comprises the following structure:<br><br>

 Another class of reagents that may advantageously contain a ketone group or one of its forms are heterobifunctional polymeric reagents. Of most use are those that react with different types of biomolecules. For example, one may have a ketone that would react with an amine group in a protein or polypeptide and a-5         maleimide functional group that would react with a thiol group in a different protein or polypeptide. An exemplary form of the aforementioned heterobifunctional polymeric reagent is shown below,<br>

15         invention.<br>
Advantageously, the polymeric reagents of the invention can comprise more than a single water-soluble polymer segment. Often, such polymeric reagents are conventionally referred to as "branched." As will be seen in further detail below, branching can be effected in the currently described polymers at the functional<br>
20         group carbon or at a point other than the functional group carbon. Branching<br>
effected at the functional group carbon provides a linear and branched polymeric reagent, thereby providing a "V" arrangement. Branching effected by a moiety other than the functional group carbon is typically nonlinear and the resulting polymeric reagent is often in the form of a letter "Y."<br>
25	An exemplary branched polymeric reagent (linear or otherwise) is<br>
comprised of a first water-soluble polymer segment, a.second water-soluble polymer segment, and a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal, wherein each of the first<br><br>

As is evident from the polymeric reagents of Formulas IV, F/a, IVb, and IVc, the functional group carbon serves as the branching point through which each of two water-soluble polymer segments is ultimately attached. In this way, the polymeric reagent has a form resembling the letter "V" or a flattened form thereof. Each water-soluble polymer segment can also be further branched, thereby providing a polymeric reagent with four or more water-soluble polymer segments.<br>

Diaza cyclic structures other than the 3,7-diaza-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one shown above can also provide a moiety suitable for branching.<br>
In some instances of the branched polymeric reagent forms of the present invention, a moiety other than the functional group carbon serves as the branching moiety. In such a case, however, the branching moiety must provide at least three attachment sites, one attachment site providing a linkage (either directly or through one or more atoms) to each of the functional group, the first water-soluble polymer segment, and the second water-soluble polymer segment.<br>

Exemplary branched polymers suitable for use as a water-soluble polymer segment herein are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462 and are based on a disubstituted lysine residue. Two specific examples of lysine-based branched polymers include an ester-containing version:<br><br>

Thus, for example, polymeric reagents encompassed by the following structure result by substituting PEG for each of POLY1 and POLY2 and using the amide-containing, lysine-based branched structure as the branching moiety with respect to Formula V:<br><br>

wherein each of (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R2, R3, R14, FG, is as previously defined with respect to Formula V, and (m) is from 3 to about 3,000.<br>
In addition, polymeric reagents encompassed by the following structure result by substituting PEG for each of POLY1 and POLY2 and using the amide-containing, lysine-based branched structure as the branching moiety with respect to Formula IV:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein each of R2, R3, R8, R9, (a), (b), (e), (f), (z), (x), X1, EW1, FG, EW3, and X3 are as previously defined, and (m) is from 3 to about 3000.<br>
Polymeric reagents comprising two or more water-soluble polymer segments advantageously provide higher molecular weight species without having to use a relatively long single polymer. Thus, for example, a polymeric reagent comprising two water-soluble polymer segments wherein each segment has a nominal average molecular weight of about 5,000 Daltons will have a total molecular weight of about 10,000 Daltons.<br>
In the context of delivering a conjugate formed from a polymeric derivative comprised of two or more water-soluble segments, individual water-soluble polymer segments can be cleaved in vivo. As one or more water-soluble polymer segments are cleaved from the conjugate, the smaller size of the resulting conjugate often results in improved clearance of the conjugate from the body. By selecting the molecular weight (i.e., size) of the water-soluble polymer segment and/or cleavable linkage in the polymeric reagent, it is possible to modulate the clearance profile of a conjugate. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segment as well as the cleavable linkage based on routine experimentation by, for example, preparing a variety of polymeric reagents with different water-soluble polymer segments weights and cleavable linkages, conjugating each of the polymeric reagents with an active agent, administering each of the conjugates to a patient, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling). Thereafter, it is possible to<br><br>
determine which polymeric reagent (based on the corresponding conjugate) provides the desired clearance profile.<br>
The pdlymeric reagents can also take other forms. For example, the polymeric reagent can be comprised of a functional group attached, either through a direct covalent bond or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment, wherein: (a) the functional group is selected from the group consisting ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithibhydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal of thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, and dithioketal, and (b) the polymeric reagent lacks saturated hydrocarbon segments having 8 carbon atoms or more. It is preferred, that the functional group is selected from the group consisting of thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, and dithioketal.<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention can be provided in the form of a composition. Typically a composition comprises two or more of the same or different polymeric reagents in addition to one or more optional components. While it may be impossible in some contexts to remove all undesirable components of a composition, it is preferred that the compositions of the polymeric reagents described herein are free or substantially free of undesirable components. Examples of undesirable components will be known to those of ordinary skill and are often dependent upon the intended uses of the composition and/or polymeric reagent. Specific examples, however, typically include impurities, components that would cause harm (i.e., be toxic) if administered to a patient, unreacted materials remaining from previous synthetic steps, and so forth.<br>
Preferably, the composition will be substantially free or, more preferably, entirely free of oxidation side products. Compositions can often be rendered substantially free or entirely free of oxidation side products by purifying a composition through, for example, chromatography, to remove any undesired oxidation side products. Another approach is to provide the polymeric reagent and any other components comprising the composition without using an oxidation step. In addition, care must be taken not to allow atmospheric oxygen to react with the composition or any of its components, thereby allowing for the creation of<br><br>
oxidation side products in the composition. In the present context, a composition that is substantially free of oxidation side products is at least 75% (by weight) free of oxidation side 'products, more preferably at least 85% (by weight) free of oxidation side products, still more preferably at least 90% (by weight) free of oxidation side products, yet more preferably at least 95% free of oxidation side products, even more preferably at least 98% (by weight) of oxidation side products, with at least 99.9% (by weight) free of oxidation side products being most preferred.<br>
Among other problems, oxidation side products can render a polymeric-- reagent composition unsuited for use as a reagent in a conjugation reaction. For example, an oxidation side product can be a cleaved portion of a water-soluble polymer segment such as PEG, which can occur when a water-soluble polymer segment has been exposed to oxidizing conditions.   In addition, an oxidation side product can be an oxidizing agent itself, which was not completely removed following a synthetic step. The agent can continue to oxidize the products of the composition, thereby initiating undesired chain cleavage of the water-soluble polymer segment. Thus, oxidation side products are preferably absent from the compositions described herein.<br>
Thus, the invention also encompasses compositions comprising a polymeric reagent comprised of a functional group attached, either through a direct covalent bond or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment, wherein the composition is substantially free of oxidation side products.<br>
An example of a polymeric reagent that can (although not necessarily) be a component of a composition that is substantially free of oxidation side products is comprised of the following structure:<br><br><br>

The functional groups other than ketone discussed herein, (i.e., ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal) can be substituted for the ketone functional group in Formula VI. m.     METHODS FOR MAKING POLYMERIC REAGENTS<br>
Before discussing the various methods for making polymeric reagents, it must be pointed out that the methods, at times, rely on the use of a protected form of a functional group. Some functional groups, such as ketals, may not require protecting. Moreover, some functional groups serve as a protected form for another functional group associated with the presently described polymeric reagents (e.g., ketals often serve as a protected form for ketones). Those of ordinary skill in the art know suitable protecting forms for each of the functional groups associated with the presently described polymeric reagents. For example, protected forms of a ketone include ketals (either cyclic or of a diether type). A ketal can be formed by reacting a ketone with an alcohol, diol, thiol, or dithiol in the presence of an acid catalyst. The ketal so formed (as well as other ketals) can be transformed into a ketone by<br><br>
acid hydrolysis. Other protected forms, as well as protecting and deprotecting the various functional groups discussed herein, are provided in Greene et al. supra.<br>
The various steps for making a polymeric reagent are carried out in a suitable solvent. One of ordinary skill in the ait can determine whether any specific solvent is appropriate for any given reaction step. Often; however, the solvent is preferably a nonpolar solvent or a polar aprotic solvent. Nonlimiting examples of nonpolar solvents include benzene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), /-butyl alcohol and toluene. Particularly preferred nonpolar solvents include toluene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and f-butyl alcohol. Exemplary polar aprotic solvents include, but are not limited to, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), HMPA (hexamethyjphosphoramide), DMF (dimethylformamide), DMA (dimethylacetamide), and NMP (//-methylpyrrolidinone).<br>
The polymeric reagents of the invention can be synthesized using a variety of routes. It should be noted that common techniques discussed with respect to one method often apply to similar techniques discussed in other methods. Consequently, discussion of any specific technique for a given method is not limited to that method and therefore applies to each method utilizing that technique.<br>
In some routes, the polymeric reagent is formed via a polymerization approach. Thus, for example, a polymeric reagent can be formed by a method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one active anionic site suitable for initiating polymerization and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal;<br>
(ii) contacting the anionic site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule;<br>
(iii) adding additional reactive monomers to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains;<br>
(iv) allowing said adding to continue until a desired length of the one or more polymer chains is reached;<br><br>
 (v) terminating the reaction, thereby resulting in a polymeric reagent comprised of the functional group or protected form thereof; and<br>
(vi) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
The anionic site serves as an initiator site for polymerization and is typically, although not necessarily, an alkoxide moiety. Alkoxide moieties are advantageously obtained by subjecting the corresponding alcohol to a deprotonating base, thereby removing the hydrogen atom from the alcohol to yield the desired alkoxide moiety.<br>
In order to form a polymeric reagent corresponding to Formula IV, a precursor molecule comprising the following structure can be used:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
Polymeric reagents corresponding to Formula I can be formed through a method comprising this approach wherein the precursor molecule comprises the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), EW1, R1, R2, and R3, are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
If the diol corresponding to Formula Vila is used or the alcohol corresponding to Formula VHb is used (wherein a hydrogen atom is attached to each alkoxide moiety), an added step of removing the hydrogen (by, for example, treating the alcohol with a deprotonating base) is required in order to yield the alkoxide initiator sites. In addition, thiolates (i.e., -S") can be used in the place of alkoxide moieties. In such a case then, the corresponding thiol or dithiol can be placed in a based to provide the necessary ionic site suited for polymerization.<br>
Specific molecules suited for use as precursor molecules in this approach include the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
These and other molecules suited for use as precursor molecules can be obtained commercially (either as shown above or in their corresponding alcohol forms) and/or may be synthesized using conventional techniques.<br><br>
Having provided a precursor molecule with an initiator site (e.g., an anionic site) suited for polymerization, the next step in this approach comprises the step of contacting the' initiator site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule. Any reactive monomer can be used to "grow" the polymer chain(s) so long as the resulting polymer chain is water soluble. It is particularly preferred, however, that the reactive monomer is ethylene oxide, thereby providing poly(ethylene oxide) chain(s). These and other polymerization techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are referenced in, for example, Odian, Chap. 7, Principles of Polymerization, 3rd Ed., McGraw-Hill, 1991.<br>
Once polymerization is initiated, additional reactive monomers are added to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains. The addition of the reactive monomers effectively allows the one or more polymer chains to "grow." Growth of the polymer chain(s) continues until a desired molecular weight is achieved, at which time the reaction is terminated. Termination can occur through any of a number of art known methods. For example, neutralizing the reaction medium will halt the growth of the polymer chain(s). In addition, adding a specific weight or amount of the reactive monomer and allowing the polymerization to proceed until all reactive monomer is exhausted results in a polymer chain having a certain and determinable molecular weight. The result is a polymeric reagent comprising a functional group or protected form thereof.<br>
Optionally and prior to carrying out an end-capping step, an electrophilically reactive polymer (either hydrophobic or hydrophilic) can be added to the polymer chain(s).<br>
An added benefit of the ethoxylation route is that it allows for capping the living polymer end (i.e., the terminal of the polymer where additional monomers can be added) with various moieties including other polymers. This allows for the generation of polymers with different properties. Thus, it is possible to cap the already formed water-soluble polymer segment with a hydrophobic polymer and generate a final polymer having hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. More importantly for many applications, it is possible to add an electrophilically reactive<br><br>
PEG derivative, thereby providing chain extension while, at the same time, adding a hydrolytically cleavable unit. The latter point is important with drug delivery of active agents,-such as pharmacologically active proteins, which may have undesirable clearance profiles from the body. A generalized example of this chain extending capping comprises reacting a monosubstituted PEG derivative that gives a carbonate, urethane or similar functional group linkage with the living polymer. Attachment of the polymer, however, must not result in a polymer conjugate that is neither water-soluble nor immunogenic.<br>
Having formed the water-soluble polymer segments in the polymeric reagent, an end-capping group optionally can be added using conventional techniques. For example, an alkyl halide (e.g., methyl halide or methyl j9-toluenesulfonate) can be reacted with the exposed terminal (the terminal or termini distal to the functional group or protected form thereof) of the polymer chain. In addition, the one or more polymer chains can be capped with an additional polymer.<br>
Optionally, when the polymeric reagent bears a protected form a functional group, the functional group can be removed using art known methods. For example, a kctal moiety (either cyclic or a diether type) can be removed by undergoing hydrolysis. Again, reference is made to Greene et al. supra, for methods of removing other protecting groups.<br>
An advantage of this ethoxylation-based approach for providing polymeric reagents having a central functional group a water-soluble polymer segment on each side of the functional group is the flexibility of molecular weight control and in the capping step. For example, one may polymerize to give a living polymer with an average molecular weight of 5,000 Daltons and cap the hydroxy end groups by adding a methylating reagent. This gives a polymer with a molecular weight of about 5,000 Daltons that has stable (relatively unreactive) end groups but with a functional moiety roughly in the center of the polymer derivative. In addition, one may cap the living polymer with chain extenders to give a higher molecular weight or with functionally reactive ether groups, such as benzyl to give a removable group that could lead to the potential of chemical modification of the end groups.<br><br>
Another polymerization-based approach for making polymeric reagents involves the use of a protected secondary alcohol. In particular, this approach the method comprises the steps of<br>
(i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of a protected secondary alcohol or thiol and at least one anionic site suitable for initiating polymerization;<br>
(ii) contacting the anionic site of the precursor molecule with a reactive monomer capable of polymerizing, to thereby initiate polymerization of the reactive monomer onto the precursor molecule;<br>
(iii) adding additional reactive monomers to the precursor molecule to form one or more polymer chains;<br>
(iv) allowing said contacting to continue until a desired length of the one or more polymer chains is reached;<br>
(v) terminating the reaction, thereby resulting in an intermediate comprised of the protected secondary alcohol or thiol;<br>
(vi) deprotecting the protected secondary alcohol or thiol of the intermediate to form an unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol;<br>
(vii) oxidizing the unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol to provide a polymeric reagent comprised of a ketone when the precursor molecule comprised a secondary alcohol or a thione when the precursor molecule comprised a secondary thiol; and<br>
(viii) optionally further modifying the ketone or thione to result in a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
Thus, with respect to steps (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), involving the use of polymerization techniques, the same polymerization techniques discussed above apply equally as well here. As above, the anionic site serves as an initiator site for polymerization and is typically, although not necessarily, an alkoxide moiety. Alkoxide moieties are advantageously obtained by subjecting the corresponding alcohol to a deprotonating base, thereby removing the hydrogen atom from the alcohol to yield the desired alkoxide moiety.<br><br>
In order to form a branched polymeric reagent of Formula IV using this approach, the precursor molecule will comprise the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur and "pg" is a protecting group for a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen and a protecting group for a secondary thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
Polymeric reagents corresponding to Formula I can be formed through a method comprising this approach wherein the precursor molecule comprises the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur and "pg" is a protecting group for a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen and a protecting group for a secondary thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
As previously indicated, the precursor molecule comprises a protected secondary alcohol or thiol. Any suitable, art-known protecting group suitable for protecting a secondary alcohol or thiol can be used, and include, for example, benzyl ether, methyoxymethyl ether (MOM), methylthiomethyl ether (MTM), tetrahydropyranyl ether (THP), 4-methoxytetrahydropyranyl ether, tetrahydrofuranyl ether, 1-ethoxyethyl ether, 1-methyl-l-methoxyethyl ether, 2-(phenylselenyl)ethyl ether, allyl ether, o-nitrobenzyl ether, triphenylmethyl ether, a-naphthyldiphenylmethyl ether, p-methyoxyphenyldiphenylmethyl ether, 9-(9-phenyl-10~oxo)anthryl ether (tritylone), isopropyldimethylsilyl ether,<br><br>
r-butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBDMS), tribenzylsilyl ether, and triisopropylsilyl ether. A particularly preferred protecting group for use with the method is benzyl ether. Specific molecules (in the corresponding alcohol forms) suited for use as precursor molecule in this approach include a monoprotected glycerol having the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y is oxygen or sulfur, "pg" is a protecting group suitable for protecting a secondary alcohol when Y is oxygen or thiol when Y is sulfur.<br>
A particularly preferred monoprotected glycerol is 2-benzyloxy-1,3-propanediol shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These and other monoprotected glycerols are available from commercial suppliers such as Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and/or can be synthesized using conventional techniques.<br>
Having formed the water-soluble polymer segment, along with optionally additionally attaching an electrophilic polymer and optionally alkylating the terminal or termini of the water-soluble polymer segment or segments, the method comprises the step of deprotecting the protected secondary alcohol or thiol to form an unprotected secondary alcohol or thiol. The protecting group can be removed using art known methods. For example, the deprotecting step can be effected by exposing the intermediate to Eb and a metal catalyst such as palladium, palladium oxide, nickel, platinum, or lead.<br>
After the deprotecting step, the method comprises carrying out an oxidizing step, which can be performed in any conventional manner and the invention is not limited in this regard. Examples of suitable oxidizing techniques comprise<br><br>
contacting the intermediate to be oxidized with an oxidizing reagent selected from the group consisting of KMnO4&gt; MnOa, KaG^O?, CrO^, pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium fluorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, RuO4, RuCl3, tetra-;z-propylammonium perruthenate, dimethyl sulfoxide, TV-chlorosuccinimide, Ag2CO3, AG2O, and Dess-Martin periodinane reagents.<br>
Other approaches for forming the polymeric reagents of the invention are not based on a polymerization approach. In one nonpolymerization approach for providing a polymeric reagent of the invention, the method comprises the steps of (i) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one isocyanate moiety and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; and (ii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule and a water-soluble polymer segment bearing at least one hydroxyl or arnine group to thereby form a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and (iii) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
In this third approach, a number of precursor molecules comprising at least one isocyanate moiety can a functional group or protected form thereof can be used.<br>
In order to form a branched polymeric reagent of Formula IV using this approach, the reaction will comprise contacting: (a) a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione,<br><br>
monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing one terminal hydroxyl group.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment will be added in at least a 2:1 molar to the isocyanate precursor molecule. It is preferred, however that an excess of the -water-soluble polymer segment is present.<br>
In order to form a polymeric reagent of Formula I using this approach, the reaction comprises contacting: (a) a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
0=C=N<br><br>
R2<br>
C+-PFG-R1	(Formula Kb)<br>
R3J<br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing one terminal hydroxyl or amine group.<br>
The water:soluble polymer segment will be added in at least a 1:1 molar ratio of water-soluble polymeric reagent to isocyanate precursor molecule. It is preferred, however that an excess of the isocyanate precursor molecule is present.<br>
In order to form a homobifunctional polymeric reagent, the reaction will comprise contacting: (a) a precursor molecule of Formula IXb; with (b) a water-soluble polymer segment bearing two terminal hydroxyl groups. The water-soluble polymer segment is typically in no more than a 1:2 molar ratio to isocyanate precursor molecule.<br><br>
In a fourth approach for preparing a polymeric reagent, a method is provided comprising the steps of (i) providing a water-soluble polymer segment having at least ene available nucleophilic group; (ii) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one activating group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal; (iii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule with the water-soluble polymer segment, thereby forming a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and (iv) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group can be any polymer terminating in a nucleophilic group. Such polymers include, without limitation: polymers bearing a terminal amine (e.g., amine-terminated PEG, available from, for example, Nektar Therapeutics, Huntsville, AL). The activating group of the precursor molecule can be any suitable activating group as that term is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, but an activating group selected from the group consisting of halide (e.g., fluoride, chloride, iodide), sulfonate esters (e.g., methansulfonate, /&gt;-toluenesulfonate, and so forth), and N-succinimidyl is preferred.<br>
Branched polymeric reagents of Formula IV can be formed using this approach by contacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group; with a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein (a), (b), (e), (f), (x), (z), X1, X3, EW1, EW3, R2, R3, R8, and R9 are as previously defined with respect to Formula IV, and further wherein each AC is an activating group and pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein<br><br>
the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal.<br>
The water-soluble polymer segment is added in at least a 2:1 molar ratio to the precursor molecule. Preferably, however, an excess of the water-soluble polymer segment is added.<br>
Polymeric reagents of Formula I can also be prepared using this approach. Thus, a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group is contacted with a precursor molecule comprised of the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein (a), (b), (z), X1, EW1, R1, R2,-and R3 are as previously defined with respect to Formula I (in the Summary of the Invention Section), and further wherein AC is an activating group and pFG is a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. The water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available nucleophilic group is added in amount equaling at least a 1:1 molar ratio of water-soluble polymer segment to the precursor molecule. It is preferred, however, that an excess of the water-soluble segment is present.<br>
A homobifunctional polymeric reagent can also be prepared by reacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least two available nucleophilic groups with a precursor molecule having a structure corresponding to Formula Xb. In this instance, the molar ratio of water-soluble polymer segment to precursor molecule is typically no more than 1:2, and typically an excess of the precursor molecule is present.<br><br>
A fifth approach for making a polymeric reagent comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one available leaving group;<br>
(ii) providing a precursor molecule comprised of at least one nucleophilic group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal;<br>
(iii) contacting, under suitable reaction conditions, the precursor molecule with the water-soluble polymer segment, thereby forming a polymeric reagent comprising the functional group or protected form thereof; and<br>
(iv) optionally, when the functional group is in the protected form, deprotecting the functional group.<br>
Preferred leaving groups on the water-soluble polymer segment include those that are primary (e.g., a primary halo), although leaving groups that are secondary may also be used. Examples of suitable leaving groups include halogens<br>
i<br>
and sulfonate esters. Among the halogens, bromo, chloro, and iodo are preferred, with bromo and chloro being particularly preferred. With respect to sulfonate esters, methanesulfonate (abbreviated "Ms"), trifluoromethanesulfonate, trichloromethanesulfonate, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonate, 2,2,2-trichloroethanesulfonate, nonafluorobutanesulfonate, p-bromobenzenesulfonate, p-nitrobenzenesulfonate, andp-toluenesulfonate are particularly preferred, although other sulfonate esters and similarly constituted leaving groups known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used as well. With respect to the precursor molecule bearing, among other things, a nucleophilic group, the nucleophilic group can be any suitable nucleophilic group that can react with the leaving group(s) associated with water-soluble polymer segment. Typically, the nucleophilic group is alkoxide (R-O~) or thiolate (R-S~), derived from removing the hydrogen from the corresponding alcohol or thiol forms, respectively. Thus, precursor molecules comprising structures corresponding to Formulas Vila and Vllb can be used. As previously indicated, specific examples of alkoxide moieties include the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In a sixth approach for providing a polymeric reagent of the invention, a method is provided comprising the step of reacting a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide ion or thiolate ion with a precursor molecule comprised of at least one leaving group and a functional group or a protected form thereof, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal, thereby providing a polymeric reagent.<br>
Conveniently, the water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion is prepared by combining a water-soluble polymer segment having at least one hydroxyl or thiol group in the presence of a suitable base. Thus, the base transforms POLY-OH into POLY-CT and POLY-SH into POLY-S". It is further believed that the water-soluble polymer, now bearing an alkoxide or thiolate moiety, in turn reacts via a Sn2 reaction mechanism with the precursor molecule comprised of a suitable leaving group. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, this approach corresponds to Williamson ether synthesis, and the<br><br>
principles and techniques generally used in a Williamson ether synthesis are applicable here as well.<br>
Nonliniiting examples of bases suitable to form alkoxides and thiolates include sodium, sodium hydroxide, potassium, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate. Preferred bases for use in accordance with this step, however, include those selected from the group consisting of sodium, potassium, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, and potassium tert-butoxide.<br>
In addition, the water-soluble polymer segment having at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion can conveniently be provided via a polymerization reaction, as previously described. In this approach for providing the water-soluble polymer segment, it is preferred that the water-soluble polymer segment has at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion.<br>
Generally, although not necessarily, an excess of the precursor molecule is allowed to react with the water-soluble polymer bearing at least one alkoxide or thiolate ion. Typically, the amount of the precursor molecule represents at least a molar equivalent to the number available hydroxyl and/or thiolate groups of the water-soluble polymer molecule. Heterofunctional polymer species (i.e., species bearing two or more different terminal functional groups) can be prepared by using nonstoichiometric amounts of the precursor molecule. That is, heterofunctional species are formed when the total number of moles of available hydroxyl or thiolate groups on the water-soluble polymer segment exceeds the total number of moles of the precursor molecule.<br>
A water-soluble polymer segment bearing an alkoxide moiety can be prepared synthetically via a polymerization process. For example, an alkoxide salt such as sodium 2-methoxy ethanolate (NaVOCE^CHaOCHs) can initiate polymerization of ethylene oxide. Assuming that the final monomer added to the polymer chain leaves a reactive group such as an alkoxide (as in the case of ethylene oxide), the polymer chain can then be reacted with the precursor molecule as discussed above.<br><br>
Any water-soluble polymer having at least one hydroxyl or thiol group (to provide, for example, a water-soluble polymer having at least one alkoxide ion or thiolate ion, respectively) can be used. Although water-soluble polymers bearing only a single hydroxyl or thiol can be used, polymers bearing two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve or more hydroxyl and/or thiol moieties can be used. Advantageously, as the number of hydroxyl or thiol moieties on the water-polymer segment increases, the number of available sites for providing ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monthiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal moieties increases. Nonlimiting examples of the upper limit of the number of hydroxyl and/or thiol moieties associated with the water-soluble polymer segment include 500, 100, 80 and 40. IV. CONJUGATES<br>
The polymeric reagents described herein are useful for conjugation to biologically active agents or surfaces. Exemplary groups suited for reaction with the polymeric reagents described herein are primary amine groups (e.g., primary amines from the side chain of a lysine residue), alcohols (e.g., a primary alcohol from the side chain of a serine or threonine residue), hydrazines, and hydrazides. Additional functional groups are reactive with ketones (and related functional groups) and can be employed in conjugation reactions when present on another molecule, e.g., active agent. Such groups suited to react with the polymeric reagents described herein are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the invention provides a method for making a conjugate comprising the step of contacting, under conjugation conditions, an active agent with a polymeric reagent comprising a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. Preferred polymeric reagents used in the conjugation reaction include those described herein (e.g., the polymeric reagents of Formulas I, II, HI, IV, V, and VI).<br>
Suitable conjugation conditions are those conditions of time, temperature, pH, reagent concentration, reagent functional group(s), available functional groups on the active agent, solvent, and the like sufficient to effect conjugation between a<br><br>
polymeric reagent and an active agent. As is known in the art, the specific conditions depend upon, among other things, the active agent, the type of conjugation desired, the presence of other materials in the reaction mixture, and so forth. Sufficient conditions for effecting conjugation in any particular case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the disclosure herein, reference to the relevant literature, and/or through routine experimentation.<br>
Exemplary conjugation conditions include carrying out the conjugation reaction at a pH of from about 4 to about 10, and at, for example, a pH of about 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, or 10.0. The reaction is allowed to proceed from about 5 minutes to about 72 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, and more preferably from about 4 hours to about 24 hours. The temperature under which conjugation can take place is typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0 °C to about 40 °C, and is often at room temperature or less. The conjugation reactions are often carried out using a phosphate buffer solution, sodium acetate, or similar system.<br>
With respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the active agent. In some cases, however, it is preferred to have stoichiometic amounts of reactive groups on the polymeric reagent to the reactive groups of the active agent. Thus, for example, two moles of a polymeric reagent having two ketone groups are combined for every mole of active agent. Exemplary ratios of polymeric reagent to active agent include molar ratios of about 1:1 (polymeric reagent:active agent), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time.<br>
Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product<br>
mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess polymeric reagent, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent), and undesired multi-conjugated species. The'resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for preparing a polymer-active agent conjugate. Any conjugating method that employs a functional group selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal can be used. A preferred conjugation approach for preparing polymer-active agent conjugates is reductive amination. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the reductive amination approach is believed to comprise nucleophilic addition of an amine-containing active agent to the functional group of a polymeric reagent, wherein the functional group is selected from the group consisting of ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, monothiohydrate, dithiohydrate, hemiketal, monothiohemiketal, dithiohemiketal, ketal, and dithioketal. With respect to reductive amination, preferred functional groups of the polymeric reagent include ketone, ketone hydrate, hemiketal, and ketal. Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with reductive amination techniques.<br>
Briefly, and without wishing to be bound by theory, an exemplary reductive amination (wherein the active agent bears an amine and the polymeric reagent comprises a ketone) first proceeds via a carbinolamine intermediate. The carbinolamine then dehydrates (condenses) to result in an imine. The imine, in turn, can then be reduced using a suitable reducing agent to form the polymer-active agent conjugate. An exemplary reducing agent is sodium cyano borohydride. In some instances, the reducing agents such as zinc in the presence of HC1, sodium borohydride, iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of alcoholic KOH, hydrogen (Hi) in the presence of a metal catalyst, and formic acid can be used. The reaction is schematically depicted in Figure 3.<br>
Of particular note is the linkage between the active agent and polymeric reagent: the amine of the active agent is attached to a secondary carbon atom of the<br><br>
polymeric reagent. Thus, in another embodiment of the invention, a conjugate is provided comprising a covalent bond between a nitrogen atom of an active agent and a secondary carbon atom derived from the polymeric reagent, A secondary carbon atom is a carbon atom that is directly bonded to two other carbons (represented as R' and R" in Figure 3). With respect to the remaining part of the conjugate, the secondary carbon atom is attached, either directly or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment. Thus, the secondary carbon atom is attached to a first carbon atom (as in R' in Figure 3) and a second carbon atom (as in R" in Figure 3) wherein at least one of the first carbon atom or second carbon atom is attached, either directly or through one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer segment.<br>
Depending on the polymeric reagent used to form the conjugate, the atom or atoms attached to the secondary carbon (other than the nitrogen from the active agent), will vary. In some instances, a methyl group is attached to the secondary carbon (i.e., one of the first carbon atom or second carbon atom attached to the secondary carbon atom is methyl). In other instances, a water-soluble polymer segment is attached to each one of the two carbon atoms (i.e., the first carbon atom and second carbon atom attached to the secondary carbon atom) attached to the secondary carbon atom, thereby providing two polymer-containing "arms" connected through the secondary carbon atom. In these instances, the conjugate comprises a second water-soluble polymer segment attached, either directly or though one or more atoms? to the secondary carbon atom. In still other instances, the water-soluble polymeric segment itself may be branched, such when a polymeric reagent shown in Formula V is conjugated to an active agent.<br>
With respect to reductive amination, the conjugates preferably lack a hydroxyl moiety attached to the secondary carbon atom, which can result from direct addition (or "1,2 addition") of a nucleophile to, for example, a carbonyl of an a,p-unsaturated carbonyl. In addition, the conjugates preferably lack a carbonyl attached to a carbon adjacent to the secondary carbon atom (i.e., lacking a carbonyl P to the secondary carbon atom), which can result from conjugate addition (or "1,4 addition").<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, a nitrogen from a primary amine-containing active agent (e.g., the primary amine from a lysine side chain of a protein, the N-terminal amine of a protein, and so forth) was used to form the conjugate. Conjugation via reductive amination can also occur when the active agent comprises a secondary amine. In this case, the resulting conjugate comprises a tertiary amine (derived from the active agent) linked to a secondary carbon (derived from the polymeric reagent).<br>
Other approaches for conjugating the polymeric reagents to active agents can also be used. For example, polymeric reagents having an a,p-unsaturated functional group (e.g., an ct,p-unsaturated ketone) can participate in direct addition, wherein a nucleophile (e.g., amine) can react by nucleophilic addition via direct addition (or "1,2 addition") to the functional group. In addition, these polymeric reagents can participate in conjugate addition (or "1,4 addition"), wherein the nucleophile becomes attached to the P carbon, and the a carbon accepts a proton from the solvent or from the conjugate acid of the nucleophile. The structure of the reagent will largely dictate how the reaction will occur. With an a,P~unsaturated ketone on the vinyl carbons and sterically hindered on the other alpha carbon, conjugate addition (1,4-addition) is expected to prevail.<br>
Regardless of the approach used in their formation, the polymer-active agent conjugates can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Alternatively, and more preferably for lower molecular weight (e.g., less than about 20,000 Dalton, more preferably less than about 10,000 Dalton) polymeric reagents used to form conjugates, the product mixture can be purified to obtain the distribution of water-soluble polymer segments per active agent. For example, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one to five PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein), typically an average of about 3 PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein). The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymeric reagent employed, the particular active agent, the desired dosing regimen, and the residual activity and in vivo properties of the individual conjugate(s).<br><br>
if desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography. That is to say, gel filtration chromatography is used to fractionate differently numbered polymer-to-active agent ratios (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein "1-mer" indicates 1 polymeric reagent to active agent, "2-mer" indicates two polymeric reagents to active agent, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segments). For example, in an exemplary reaction where a 100,000 Dalton protein is randomly conjugated to a ketone-containing PEG having a molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons, the resulting reaction mixture may contain unmodified protein (having a molecular weight of about 100,000 Daltons), monoPEGylated protein (having a molecular weight of about 120,000 Daltons), diPEGylated protein (having a molecular weight of about 140,000 Daltons), and so forth.<br>
While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other polymer-active agent conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment sites within the protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to sepm-ate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) within the active agent.<br>
Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims et al. (1980) Anal. Biochem, 107:60-63). and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
Separation of positional isomers is carried out by reverse phase chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography<br><br>
 (RP-HPLC) CIS column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to separate polymer-active agent isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).<br>

agent prior to conjugation as well as the active agent "residue" following conjugation.<br>
V. PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.<br>
Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.<br>
A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.<br>
The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.<br>
The preparation can also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Nonlimiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combinations thereof.<br>
An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate,<br><br>
sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.<br>
A surfactant can be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as "Tween 20" and "Tween 80," and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, New Jersey); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.<br>
Acids or bases can be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through<br><br>
routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>
These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients are described in "Remington: The Science &amp; Practice of Pharmacy", 19th ed., Williams &amp; Williams, (1995), the "Physician's Desk Reference", 52nd ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), and Kibbe, A.H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically, although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid solutions or suspensions immediately prior to administration. The pharmaceutical preparation can also take other forms such as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, powders, and the like. Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
As previously described, the conjugates can be administered injected parenterally by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others. VI. METHODS OF ADMINISTERING<br>
The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via<br><br>
injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.00.1 mg to 100 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>
One advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that individual water-soluble polymer portions can be cleaved off. Such a result is advantageous when clearance from the body is potentially a problem because of the polymer size. Optimally, cleavage of each water-soluble polymer portion is facilitated through the use of physiologically cleavable and/or enzymatically degradable linkages such as urethane, amide, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate (via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer portions) can be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type functional group that would provide the desired clearance properties. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group. For<br><br>
example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of polymer derivatives with different polymer weights and cleavable functional groups, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling) by administering the polymer derivative to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified.<br>
It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the preferred specific embodiments thereof, that the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>
VII. EXPERIMENTAL<br>

Such techniques are fully explained in the literature. See, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions Mechanisms and Structure, 4th Ed. (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1992), supra.<br>

Formation of mPEG (2K Da)-2-hydroxypropane<br>
To an azeotropically dried solution of mPEGaicMesylate Nektar Therapeutics, 2 g, 1 mmole) in 50 mL of anhydrous toluene, 1,2-propanediol (1.522 g, 20 mmole) and sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil, 0.800 g, 20 mmole) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours at 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The insoluble precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to dryness. The crude product was dissolved in 3 mL of dichloromethane and precipitated with 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol - diethyl ether (1:1) mixture. The final product was collected using vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 1.4 g. NMR (d6-DMSO): 1.01 ppm (d, -CH3, 3H), 3.24 ppm (s, -OCH3) 3H), 3.51 ppm (s, polymer backbone), 4.54 ppm (d, -OH, 1H).<br>
Formation of mPEG (2K Da)-methyl ketone<br>
To a stirred suspension of molecular sieves 4A (0.5 g), potassium carbonate (0.34 g, 2.46 mmol), and N-chlorosuccinimide (0.037 g, 0.277mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane were successively added mPEG (2K Da)-2-<br><br>
/'<br>
Hydroxypropane (0.5 g, 0.25 mmol) andN-tert-butylbenzenesulfenamide (0.009 g, 0.050 mmol) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 hours. Next, the solvent was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 20 mL water, the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with 10 % of HsPCU, and the desired product was extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL x 2). The extract was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated under vacuum, and precipitated with 20 ml of a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and diethyl ether (1:1). The precipitated product was collected through vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 0.35 g<br>

Depending on the conditions, the ketone exists in variable amounts of ketone and ketone hydrate. The ketone and ketone hydrate are in equilibrium in the presence of water, both of which can be used (either alone or in combination) to form polymer-active agent conjugates.<br>
PEGylation of lysozyme<br>
Lysozyme (3.0 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and mPEG (2K Da)-methyl ketone (8.4 mg, 20 fold molar excess) was added. After 15 minutes, 0.159 M solution of NaCNBH3 (66 pL, 50 fold molar excess) was then added and the solution was stirred for 17 hours at room temperature. Analysis of the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE showed that PEGylated lysozyme was formed.<br>
This example is repeated several times using different sizes of polymer. First, mPEO mesylate of different sizes are used in place of mPEGaK mesylate to provide a variety of mPEG methyl ketones having different sizes. Specifically, the following different sizes of mPEG mesylate are used: mPEGsK mesylate; mPEGioK mesylate; and mPEG2oK mesylate. Once the mPEG methyl ketones having a variety of different sizes are formed, each is conjugated to lysozyme using the procedure described above. Results similar those obtained for the mPEG2K methyl ketone are obtained.<br><br>

Increasing the ratio of PEG reagent to protein increases the degree of polyPEGylation, that is to say, the formation of 2-mers, 3-mers, and so on.<br>
The above demonstrates random PEGylation of an illustrative protein of the invention to yield a distribution of PEGylated EPO products. If desired, the reaction mixture can be further separated to isolate the individual isomers as described below.<br>
PEG conjugates having different molecular weights are separated by gel filtration chromatography. The different PEG conjugates (1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth) are fractionated on the basis of their different molecular weights (in this case, varying by approximately 5,000 Daltons). Specifically, the separation is performed by using a serial column system suitable for effective separation of products in the molecular weight range observed, e.g., a Superdex™200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The products are eluted with 10 ml acetate buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The collected fractions (1 ml) are analyzed by OD at 280 nrn for protein content and also using an iodine test for PEG content (Sims et al.<br><br>
(1980) Anal. Biochem. 107:60-63).  In addition, the results can be visualized by running an SDS PAGE gel, followed by staining with barium iodide. Fractions corresponding to the eluted peaks are collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a membrane, and lyophilized. This method results in separation/purification of conjugates having the same molecular weights but does not provide separation of conjugates having the same molecular weight but different PEGylation sites (i.e., positional isomers).<br>
Separation of positional isomers is carried out by reverse phase chromatography using an RP-HPLC CIS column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac). This procedure is effective for separating PEG-biomolecule isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).  The reverse-phase chromatography is carried out using a RP-HPLC CIS preparative column and eluted with a gradient of water/0.05% TFA (Eluent A) and acetonitrile/0.05% TFA (Eluent B).<br>
Fractions corresponding to the eluted peaks are collected, evaporated to eliminate acetonitrile and TFA, followed by removal of solvent to isolate the individual positional PEG-isomers.<br>

The reaction mixture is analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the degree of PEGylation. Confirmation of the degree of PEGylation, 1-mer, 2-mers, and so one, is carried out by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption lonization Tim.3-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

PEGylated species differ by approximately 5,000 Daltons. The resulting reaction mixture primarily contains a mixture of native and monoPEGylated protein. The morioPEGylated species are purified by column chromatography to remove free EPO and higher molecular weight species.<br>
Confirmation of N-terminal PEGylation is carried out by peptide mapping. Increasing the ratio of PEG to protein increases the degree of PEGylation, yielding polyPEGylated protein.<br>
The above demonstrates PEGylation of an illustrative protein of the invention to yield a predominantly N-terminal single PEGylated protein.<br>
