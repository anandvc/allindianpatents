Process and device in a spinning machine for determination of control action points for draft equipments..<br>
The invention refers to a process in a spinning machine for determination of control action points for draft equipments in which the change of a quality characterizing variable of fibre material as for example thickness,mass or the equivalent is measured, is provided to a regulating - and/or control equipment and is called on for change of draft and engages an advantageous device for carrying out the process.<br>
The invention refers specially to the homogenizing of textile fibre silvers in draft equipments of spinning machines In preparation machines frequently draft unit is provided in filling boxes. In cards and combing, one can bring in likewise controllable draft equipments in filling boxes or rather in drafting area. At entry of cards and combing, sensors exist which scan the thickness of non woven fleece and control the received signal corresponding to feed roll for homogenizing non-woven fleece. At exit of cards and combing there are sensors for checking sliver mass. The signal corresponding to the sliver mass fluctuation can be used in order to regulate as per the control principle the feed roll at entry of machine or to control in a reconnected draft unit with two delivery roll pairs at exit of machine.<br>
In auto-levellers of different spinning systems as for example cotton spinning mill, worsted spinning mill, semi worsted yarn spinning mill, carded yarn spinning mill and bast fibre spinning mill slivers are guided together and followingly repeatedly stretched. During the stretching in the draft equipment sliver mass fluctuations are additionally neutralised with help of regulations.<br>
In auto-leveller likewise as in cards and combing the control - as well as the regulating principle comes to<br><br>
2.<br>
application. In control principle the sensor of sliver mass fluctuations is located as measuring position before the draft equipment. In regulating principle the sensor is located in measuring position after the draft equipment. In both cases the signal corresponding to sliver mass fluctuation is used for change of draft in main draft zone.<br>
The coverage of mass fluctuations or rather thickness follows in principle with a mechanical scanning system before the drafting device entry. The measuring signal is intermediately supplied and after a specified time or a definite path the regulation is switched on which averages out the mass fluctuations. This input point is the control input point. The averaging out of mass fluctuations in main draft zone is obtained through the change of number of rotations of control motor, in doing so. the number of rotations of motor for the drive of supply rolls (exit rolls) is maintained constant.<br>
Known processes and devices meet the exact maintenance of control input points and their correction under consideration of machine interval influences and / or environment influences (DE 4215682, A1, DE 43 06 343C1). Further proposals consider the influence of the start and stop of auto levellers or the inertia condition of scanning item and construction groups for drive of drafting roll. As per EP 0803 596 A2 the determination of adjustment values for the control input point and/or the strengthening is planned. Therein the control input point is determined in a pre-operation test - or adjustment course of drawing frame or card and is kept in operation. The proposals till now rest basically on it, to maintain the control action point constant in operation. Changes take place purely in the pre adjustment of machine.<br>
From Melliand Textile Report 79 (1998),. 403-404, 406-407, it is known that the fibre movement condition in the draft zone<br><br>
3.<br>
is strongly dependent on the delivery speed. At lower speeds an uniform fibre movement as a rule takes place. At higher speeds right in the middle of draft zone a rapid acceleration takes place. Therein it was to observe that speed conditions of fibres over the breadth as well as also over period are less constant. Additionally in a part of fibres, there comes strongly . a change of acceleration -and slowing down process, that means the fibre accelerations do not take place continuously. These effects are to trace back on an increase of drafting wave and sliver thickness fluctuations. These fluctuations of fibre movements are reasons for non homogenizing of fibre slivers.<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of the invention to procure a process and a device of the type described at the entry, which avoid the mentioned disadvantages which specially makes possible a substantial improvement of degree of efficiency of regulation and the evenness of draftable fibre slivers. Particularly the regulating process will be further  optimised.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the distinguishing features of claim 1 or rather 11.<br>
As per invention the control action point during production under otherwise same conditions - is changed depending on the mass fluctuation. In this way the efficiency of regulation is meaningfully improved. Therein first the mass fluctuation is registered. Followingly on basis of registered value the optimum control action points are determined with help of a computer algorithm or rather a transfer function, so that depending on result for each measurement of sliver thickness a control action point is assigned. Therein the control action point is designed variable in operation of auto leveller.<br><br>
4.<br>
For the calculation of optimum control action point purposefully a microprocessor is used. The covered mass fluctuations, which are decisive for the change of number of rotations of control motor and the associated calculated control action points are intermediately supplied and called off after reaching of assigned reaction points. Preferably over a frequency converter the number of rotation reference value is given further to the control motor. The position of regulation and consequently the back lying path draft from measurement position up to reaction point is variable independent of fibre material, in doing so a special meaning comes to processing material types.<br>
The speciality of fibre materials as for example static and dynamic friction conditions as well as fibre type can flow in the calculation algorithm or rather in the transfer function. Out of draft theoraetical reasons, it can be advantageous to take up the control of sliver masses so late as possible in spinning process. There exists the proposal to provide a regulating equipment in opener units of OE -Spinning machines (DE 34 25345 A1). Due to cost reasons this solution was not yet applied serially in the practice. Advantageously the invention is applied in opener units of 0E-Spinning machines. Also here first the sliver mass fluctuations is registered. Connectingly on basis of registered values the optimum control action points are determined with help of a computer algorithm or rather a transfer function, so that depending on results for each measurement of sliver measurement a control action point is allocated. Through it the control action point is designed variable in operation of auto levellers.<br>
The invention is applied not only in draft equipments of preparation machines, drawing frames and OE spinning machines, but also on drafting device of spinning machine (for example in the drafting device flyer, of neps, ring<br><br><br>
5.<br>
spin - and air spinning machine). Such draft equipments were so long not equipped serially with control equipments due to cost reasons. Out of draft technical grounds the application of invention that means the input of a control equipment with continuous calculation of control actions point is useful.<br>
The claims 2 to 10 and 12 to 24 have advantageous further developments of invention in content.<br>
The invention is followingly explained closer with help of execution example diagramatically. <br>
It shows :<br>
Fig.1 schematically in side view the entry device and the licker in of a card or combing with the device as per invention as well as a short term regulation.<br>
Fig.2 Schematically in side view a card with the device as per invention and a long term regulation.<br>
Fig.3 schematically in side view a drawing frame including drafting device with the device as per invention.<br>
Fig.4 Schematically in side view the resolving unit of a OE-spinning machine with the device as per invention.<br>
Fig.5 Schematic side view of drafting device of a spinning machine (Ring spin machine) with the device as per invention.<br>
In the Fig.l and 2, control equipment in cards as for example Truetzschler high capacity card DK 903 and combing<br><br><br>
6.<br>
are schematically represented. In Fig.l the masses of non-woven fleece b running in the machine is checked with help of sensor 1. The number of rotation of feed roll or rather draft unit 4 is controlled over the controller 2 and drive 3 corresponding to the signal. The feed table is denoted with 42. As per Fig.2 the sensor 7 is represented for checking of sliver mass 43 before draft unit of card exit. the signal corresponding to sliver mass is used for long time control at the card, in which the signal covered by the sensor 7 works over a corresponding controller 2 on the feed roll drive 3. In both the control equipments as per Fig.l and 2 the control input point is continuously changed.<br>
Fig.3 shows the draft equipment of cotton draftina frame as for example Truetzschler high capacity drafting frame HS in which multiple number fibre slivers 13 run through a scanning equipment 14a, 14b side by side, which registers the sliver thickness continuously and transfers further to control instrument 15. Connectingly the doubled slivers pass a drafting device 16, as rule made out of three roll pairs, between which the real draft takes place. The drafting device comprises a pre draft zone (between the roll pairs 23a, 23b and 24a, 24b) and a main draft zone (between the roll pairs 24a, 24b and 25a, 25b). The distorted fibre non-woven fleece is covered to a drafting frame sliver with help of a non woven fleece funnel 17 and is deposited in a can over a second sliver scanning instrument 18a, 18b and sliver guide aggregate. The delivery rolls 25a, 25b, are driven by an electromotor 19 with a constant number of rotations. the roll pairs 23a, 23b, 24a, 24b assembled before the delivery rolls are activated by a control motor 20. On ground of different circumferential speeds of roll pair the fibre slivers become distorted corresponding to their proportion. The changes of number of rotations of control motor 20 lead consequently to a change of degree of draft. This change is controlled by control equipment 22 with help of an actuator signal which correlates with the mass fluctuations of fibre slivers in entry area of drafting frame.<br><br>
7.<br>
Fig.4 shows a regulating equipment at an opener unit of an OE - spinning machine with feed roll 27, feed table 44 and opening roll 28, in which the device as per invention is assembled. First the sliver mass fluctuations are registered with the measuring element 30. Followingly on basis of registered values the optimum control action points over the controller 31 and determined with help of a computer algorithm or rather a transfer function, so that depending on results for each measurement of sliver measurement a control action point is assigned. Through it the control action point is designed variable in the operation of auto leveller.<br>
As per Fig.5 the device as per invention is assigned to the drafting device of a ring spinning machine. 38 represents the sensor. The signal corresponding to the mass fluctuation works over the controller 39 on the drive 40. The drive 41 for the starting cylinder is constant. On basis of registered values the optimum control action points are determined with help of a computer algorithm or rather a transfer function, so that depending on results for each measurement of sliver mass a control action point is assigned. Through it the control action point is designed variable in operation of drafting frame.<br><br>
