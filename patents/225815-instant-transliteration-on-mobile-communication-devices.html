Instant Transliteration on Mobile Communication Devices FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[001] The embodiments herein generally relate to mobile communication devices, and, more particularly, to transliteration in mobile communication devices.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
[002] Mobile communication devices primarily allow communication through voice and text. Mobile communications devices, by default, come with English language support due io the wide spread use of the language in the western world. With ever increasing use of mobile communication devices elsewhere in the world, there is a need to facilitate communication among users that communicate in other languages through text.<br>
[003] Transliteration is the practice of transcribing a word or text written in one writing system into another writing system or system of rules for such practice. While there are many transliteration systems, existing transliteration systems do not provide instant transliteration on mobile communication devices,<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[004] In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a method for instant ransliteration in a mobile communication device, the method comprising the steps of user selecting a language for transliteration; device recognizing text input events from user; converting input text after every recognized text input event into Unicode of said elected language; converting Unicode into bitmap to be displayed on display of said evice; and providing display of transliteration text in said selected language.<br>
[005] These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and<br><br>
understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof; are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
[006] The embodiments herein will be better understood from the following description with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a mobile communication device in accordance with various<br>
embodiments disclosed herein;<br>
FIG. 2 is a method in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein;<br>
FIG. 3 shows an example in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein;<br>
FIG. 4 shows an example in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein;<br>
and<br>
FIG. 5 shows an example in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein;<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
[007] The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the<br><br>
embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.<br>
[008] As mentioned, there remains a need for an instant transliteration system. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIGS. 1 through 5, where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.<br>
[009] A typical mobile phone keyboard has only numeric keypad (typically keys 0 to 9 and *,# etc). There is a standard mapping of these keys to English alphabets a to z, with provision to switch to Capital letters. Numeric mode, etc. A typical m.obile communication device keypad mapping shown below in Table 1 with mapping of keys 1 to 9 to alphabets a to z and other special characters.<br><br>
[0010] Since keypads are numeric, for typing the letter 's' a user has to navigate through letters 'p', 'q', and 'r' before typing the letter's'. In other words, key 7 is pressed 4 times in quick succession. Existing transliteration systems wait for a letter to be completed (for example to complete letter 's' after navigating through 'p', 'q' and 'r'). In other systems, systems even wait for a word to be completed before actually providing transliteration. Since the user is typing in one language to be transliterated in to another language system, user is not always sure whether what he is typing will be transliterated in a proper and readable format. Hence it is important to show the user transliterated text as and when he types a letter so that he can make any necessary action to ensure proper output.<br><br>
[0011] Disclosed embodiments use Hindi as a language merely for the purposes of illustration and should not be construed as a limitation of invention in any manner.<br>
[0012] FIG.l shows a block diagram (100) of an example mobile communication device in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein. The device has an interface (104) for an user to interact with. For example, interface includes at least a keypad as shown in Table 1 and a display but may also include other components including touch screens, pressure sensors etc. The device further comprises of an interface listener (106) to listen to events relating iu text input. The events recognized include but are not limited to key events including "On key press" (event of pressing a key and before releasing), "On key release" (event of a key being leleased after a press), etc. Furthermore, the device comprises of a transliteration engine (108) with a set of transliteration rules (110) for a plurality of languages. The device also comprises of a Unicode rendering engine (112) to render Unicode received to bitmap in an appropriate manner for a specified language. The Unicode rendering engine (112) makes use of language specific information (114) including composition, fonts and their sizes to provide with required bitmaps. In various embodiments, the interface listener (106), the transliteration engine (108) and the Unicode rendering engine (110) may be implemented as a programmable micro-controller, an executable software loaded on to a memory component, or as any other suitable programmable embedded component.<br>
[0013] FIG. 2 shows a method in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein. When a user (102) enters text upon selecting a language at 202 using the device interface (104), the interface listener (106) listens to events of such text input. On recognizing text events (for example, "On key press", "On key release") at 204, the control is transferred to the transliteration engine (108) at 206 to provide with Unicode for the text input until the last event recognized, for every event. The transliteration engine in turn uses stored transliteration rules (110) to provide mapped Unicode for the selected language for the text input at 208 until the last event recognized. Further, control is transferred to the Unicode rendering engine (112) at 210 for providing hitman<br><br>
information for the Unicode provided by the transliteration engine (108). The Unicode rendering engine (112) uses language specific information (114) stored to obtain the relevant bitmap for the Unicode obtained at 212. Subsequently, display the interface (104) is updated with the bitmaps obtained at 212 to provided instant transliteration to user (102).<br>
[0014] Tlie transliteration rules (110) contain language mapping arrays. Every element of Language Mapping Array specifies English character(s) mapped to Language Unicode charactef(s). The mapping will decide which English character(s) will be substituted by which language character(s) in case of English to another Language (for example, Hindi) transliteration and vice versa in case of another Language (for example, Hindi) to English transliteration.<br>
[0015] The Unicode rendering engine (112) provides capability handling complex Indian and other similar language rendering requirements like consonant-clusters/rephars etc. The engine (112) is a per language composition engine and a per language compressed bitmap font. This engine converts the input Unicode strings to a bitmap represented by an array of pixels, for example, in AARRGGBB {alpha, red, green, blue} format. The steps involved in conversion are as following:<br>
a)	split the input Unicode string into sections of consecutive words belonging to same language, and operate on each section with the next steps,<br>
b)	use a language specific composer to map the input llnicode string into logical groups forming 'akshars',<br>
c)	map Unicode forming an 'akshar' to a sequence of 'glyph' indices, and<br>
d)	pick the bitmaps from a desired size of font for that language using the 'glyph' indices and copy them to target bitmap array.<br><br>
[0016] The process is illustrated for a word 'krikeT' in Hindi:<br>
a)	Input Unicode string is {0x915, 0x94D, 0x930, 0x93F, 0x915, 0x94/, 0x91F} which is { Letter K, Half Indicator, Letter R, I matra, Letter K, E matra, Letter T}<br>
b)	The Unicode string gets split into akshar groups as {{0x915,0x94D,0x930,0x93F},{0x915,0x947},{0x91F}} which is {{Unicode forming kri},{Unicode forming ke},{Unicode forming T}}<br>
c)	These groups get mapped to glyph indices that when put after one another form the required graphics as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0017] FIG. 4 shows an example display on a mobile communication device in accordance with various embodiments as disclosed herein. A split screen with user text input in English at the bottom and transliterated text in Hindi at the top of the display is shown (400).<br>
[00181 FIG. 5 shows an example of instant transliteration as seen by a user of a mobile communication device. As the user tries to type the letter 's', user navigates through the letters 'p' (502), 'q' (504), and 'r' (506) before typing 's' (508). The device updates the display automatically after every key stroke to update the transliterated text or bitmap.<br>
[0019] The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments, ft is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Therefore, while the embodiments herein have been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments herein can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
