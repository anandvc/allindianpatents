Synergistic herbicidal compositions comprising herbicides from the group of the hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors<br>
The invention is in the field of crop protection compositions which can be used against undesirable vegetation and which comprise, as active compounds, a combination of at least two herbicides.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to herbicidal compositions which, as active compound, comprise a herbicide from the group of the hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors in combination with at least one further herbicide.<br>
Herbicides from the abovementioned group of the hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors are known from numerous documents. Recently disclosed inhibitors of this type usually carry a substituted benzoyl radical on a likewise substituted radical from the group consisting of cyclohexanedione, pyrazole, isoxazole, isothiazoie and 3-oxoproplonitrile. Thus, WO 97/23135 describes benzoytpyrazoles, EP-A 0 810 227 describes benzoyl isoxazoles and WO 98/29406 describes benzoyl-cyclohexanediones having in each case herbicidal action. Further herbicidal benzoyl derivatives are known from WO 99/06259. This document also indicates the mechanism of action, which is the same as for the benzoyl derivatives described in the present invention.<br>
In practice, however, the use of the benzoyl derivatives known from these publications has frequently been associated with disadvantages. Thus, the herbicidal activity of the known compounds is not always satisfactory, or, in the case of satisfactory herbicidal activity, undesirable damage to the useful plants is observed.<br>
The activity of herbicides depends inter alia on the type of herbicide used, its application rate, the preparation, the harmful plants to be controlled in each case, climatic and soil conditions, etc. A further criterion is the persistency or the rate at which the herbicide is degraded. Changes in the sensitivity of harmful plants to an active compound which may occur on<br><br>
prolonged use or in specific geographical areas may also have to be taken into account. Such changes manifest themselves by a more or less pronounced loss in activity and can only be compensated under certain conditions by higher herbicide application rates.<br>
Owing to the large number of possible influencing factors, there is virtually no individual active compound which has all the desired properties for different requirements, in particular with respect to the species of harmful plant and the climatic zones. Furthermore, there is the permanent object to achieve the desired effect using more and more reduced herbicide application rates. A lower application rate reduces not only the amount of active compound required for the application, but generally also reduces the amount of formulation auxiliaries required. Both reduce the economical expense and improve the ecological compatibility of the herbicide treatment.<br>
A frequently used method for improving the use profile of a herbicide is the combination o1 the active compound with one or more other active compounds which contribute the desired additional properties. However, the combined use of a plurality of active compounds is frequently associated with phenomena of physical and biological incompatibility, for example insufficient stability of a joint formulation, decomposition of an active compound or antagonism of the active compounds. What is desired are, in contrast, active compound combinations having a favorable activity profile, high stability and, if possible, synergistically enhanced activity, thus permitting the application rate to be reduced, compared with the individual application of the active compounds to be combined.<br>
EP-A 0 768 033, WO 97/23135, ZA 9 510 980 and WO 98/28981 each disclose combinations o1 specific benzoylpyrazoies with other herbicides. US 5,912,207 describes herblcidal preparations comprising metal chelates of specific benzoylcyclohexanediones.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide herblcidal compositions having better properties than those of the prior art.<br><br>
The   invention   provides   herbicidal   compositions,   comprising   an effective amount of<br>
A) at least one compound of formula (I) and its agriculturally customary salts (Component A)<br><br>

In formula (I) and in ail subsequent formulae, carbon-containing radical chains such as alkyl, alkoxy, haloaikyi, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and aikylthio and the corresponding radicals which are unsaturated and/or substituted in the carbon skeleton, such as aikenyl and alkynyl, can in each case be straight-chain or branched. Unless specifically indicated othenvise, the lower carbon skeletons, for example having 1 to 6 C atoms or, in the case of unsaturated groups, having 2 to 4 C atoms, are preferred for these radicals. Alkyl radicals, also in the composed meanings, such as alkoxy, haloaikyi, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, i-hexyl and 1,3-dimethyIbutyI, heptyls, such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl; aikenyl and aikynyl radicals have the meaning of the possible unsaturated radicals which correspond to the alkyl radicals; aikenyl is, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methyl-prop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-en-1-yl and 1-methyl-but-2-en-1-yl; aikynyl is, for example, propargyl, but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-yn-1-yl. The multiple bond can be in any position of the unsaturated radical.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, cycloalkyi is a carbocyclic saturated ring system having three to nine C atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Analogously, cycloalkenyl is a monocyclic aikenyl group having three to nine carbon ring members, for example cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl, where the double bond can be in any position.<br>
In the case of a disubstituted amino group, such as dialkylamino, these two substituents can be identical or different.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Haloaikyi, -aikenyl and -aikynyl is alkyl, aikenyl and aikynyl, respectively, which is partially or fully substituted by halogen- preferably by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, in<br><br>
particular by fluorine or chlorine, for example CF3, CHF2, CH2F, CF3CF2, CH2FCHCI, CCI3, CHCI2. CH2CH2CI; haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF3. OCHF2, OCH2F, CF3CF2O, OCH2CF3 and OCH2CH2CI; this applies correspondingly to haloalkenyl and other halogen-substituted radicals.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" is to be understood as meaning the radicals of three- to nine-membered saturated, partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles which contain one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. If chemically possible, these radicals can be attached at any position of the heterocycle. Heterocycly! is preferably axiridinyl, oxiranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothienyl, pyrrolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, isoxazolinyi, thiazolinyl, thiazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, morpholinyl, piperidinyl, dioxolanyl, dioxanyl, piperazinyl, oxepanyl, azepanyl.<br>
Heteroaryl is the radical of a heteroaromatlc compound which, in addition to carbon ring members, contains one to five heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Heteroaryl is preferably furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothlazolyl, 1,2,3-tria2olyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5-oxadia20lyl, 1,3,4-oxadia2olyl, 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5-thiadia2olyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazolyI, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazlnyl, 1,2,4-triazinyl, 1,3,5-triazinyl.<br>
Aryl is an aromatic mono- or polycyclic hydrocarbon radical, for example phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl and phenanthryl.<br>
The term "partially or fully halogenated" is meant to express that some or all of the hydrogen atoms In the groups characterized In this manner can be replaced by identical or different halogen atoms as mentioned above.<br>
If a group or a radical is polysubstiluted, this is to be understood as meaning that when the different substituents are combined, the general principles of the construction of chemical compounds have to be followed, i.e. that no compounds are formed which are known to the person skilled in the art to be chemically unstable or not possible. This also applies accordingly to the attachment of individual radicals.<br><br>
Depending on the steric and/or electronic conditions, an oxo group may also be present in the tautomeric enol form.<br>
(f a group or a radical is polysubstituted by other radicals, these other radicals can be identical or different.<br>
If a group or a radical is mono- or polysubstituted without the number and the type of substituents being given in detail, this is to be understood as meaning that this group or this radical is substituted by one or more identical or different radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, formyl, carboxyl, amino, Ihio, (C1-C6)-alkyl, (C1-C6)-alkoxy, halo-(C1-C6)-alkyl, halo-(C1-C6)-alkoxy, (C2-C6)-alkenyl, (C2-C6)-alkynyl, (C2-C6)-alkenyloxy, (C2-C6)-a)kyny)oxy, (C3-C6)-cycioaIkyI, {C3-C6)-cyc!oalkoxy, (C1-C6)-alkyIthio, haio-{C1-C6)-alkylthio.<br>
Depending on the type and the attachment of the substituents, the compounds of the formula I can be present as stereoisomers. If, for example, one or more alkenyl groups are present, diastereomers may exist. If, for example, one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms are present, enantiomers and diastereomers may exist. From the mixtures produced in the preparation, stereoisomers can be obtained by customary separation methods, for example by chromatographic separation procedures. Stereoisomers can also be prepared selectively by using stereoselective reactions and employing optically active starting materials and/or auxiliaries. The invention also relates to all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof which are embraced by the fomiula I but not defined specifically.<br>

The active compounds mentioned above by their common names are known, for example, from "The Pesticide Manual", 11th edition, 1997, British Crop Protection Council, and/or are shown in the table brelow.<br><br><br><br>
In the combinations according to the invention, application rates in the range from 1 to 2000 g, preferably from 10 to 500 g, of active ingredient per hectare (ai/ha) of the Component A) and from 1 to 2000 g, preferably from 1 to 500 g of the Component B) are generally required.<br>
The weight ratios of the Components A) to B) to be used can be varied within wide ranges. The ratio is preferably in the range from 1:50 to 500:1, in particular in the range from 1:20 to 50'.1. Optimum weight ratios may depend on the particular field of application, on the weed spectrum and the active compound combination used and can be determined in preliminary experiments.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be employed for the selective control of annual and perennial monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants in crops of cereals (for example barley, oats, rye, wheat), corn and rice and in crops of transgenic useful plants or crops of useful plants selected by classical means which are resistant to active compounds A) and B). Likewise, they can be employed for controlling undesirable harmful plants in plantation crops such as oil palm, coconut palm, Indian-rubber tree, citrus, pineapples, cotton, coffee, coca and the like, and also in fruit production and viticulture.<br><br>
The compositions according to the Invention act against a broad spectrum of weeds. They are suitable, for example, for controlling annual and perennial harmful plants such as, for example, from the species abutilon, alopecurus, avena, chenopodium, cynoden, cyperus, digitaria, echinochloa, elymus, galium, Ipomoea, lamium, matricaria, scirpus, setaria, sorghum, veronica, viola and xanthium.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are also distinguished by the fact that the effective dosages of the Components A) and B) used in the combinations are reduced with respect to an individual dosage, so that it is possible to reduce the required active compound application rates.<br>
The invention also provides a method for controlling undesirable vegetation, which method comprises applying one or more herbicides A) together with one or more herbicides B) to the harmful plants, parts thereof or to the area under cultivation.<br>
When herbicides of Type A) and B) are applied jointly, superadditive (= synergistic) effects are observed. The activity in the combinations is more pronounced than the expected sum of the activities of the individual herbicides employed and the activity of the particular individual herbicide A) and B). The synergistic effects permit the application rate to be reduced, a broader spectrum of broad-leaved weeds and weed grasses to be controlled, more rapid onset of the herbicidal action, a more prolonged action, better control of the harmful plants by only one application, or few applications, and widening of the period of time within which the product can be used. These properties are required in weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesirable competing plants and thus to ensure and/or to increase quality and quantity of the yields. These novel combinations markedly surpass the prior art with respect to the described properties.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can either be present as mixed formulations of the Components A) and B), if appropriate together with other customary formulation auxiliaries, which mixed formulations are then applied in the usual manner in the form of a dilution with water, or else they can be prepared in the form of so-called<br><br>
tank mixes by joint dilution with water of the components which are formulated separately, or partly separately.<br>
The Components A) and B) can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or physicochemical parameters. Suitable general possibilities for formulations are, for exampte: wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions (EW) such as oil-in-water and water-in-oll emulsions, sprayabie solutions or emulsions, oil- or water-based dispersions, suspoemulsions, dusts (DP), seed dressing products, granules for soil application or for broadcasting or water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules or waxes.<br>
The individual types of formulation are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Vol. 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986; van Valkenburg, "Pesticides Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd, London. The formulation auxiliaries required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are also known and are described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook o1 Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry"; 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscienoe, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheon's, "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem, Publ, Co. Inc., N.Y, 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Vol. 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other pesticidally active substances, such as other herbicides, fungicides or insecticides, and also safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready mix or tank mix.<br><br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active compound, also comprise ionic or nonionic surfactants (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols or fatty amines, alkanesuifonates or alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaunnate, in addition to a diluent or an inert substance.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with the addition of one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Examples of emulsifiers which can be used are: calcium alkyiarylsulfonates, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, potyoxyethylene sorbltan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid materials, for example talc, natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto absorptive, granulated inert material, or by applying active compound concentrates to the surface of carriers, such as sand, kaolinite or granulated inert material, with the aid of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers. Water-dispersible granules are, In general, prepared by processes such as<br><br>
spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing using high¬speed mixers, and extrusion without solid inert material.<br>
The agrochemical preparations generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 percent<br>
by weight, in particular from 0.2 to 95% by weight, of active compounds of<br>
ypes A) and B), the following concentrations being customary, depending<br>
)n the type of formulation: In wettable powders, the active compound<br>
:oncentration is, for example, approximately 10 to 95% by weight, the<br>
emainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation<br>
components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active compound<br>
concentration can be, for example, from 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations<br>
in the form of dusts in most cases comprise from 5 to 20% by weight of<br>
active compound, sprayable solutions approximately 0.2 to 25% by weight<br>
of active compound. In the case of granules, such as disperslble granules,<br>
the active  compound content depends  partly on  whether the  active<br>
compound is in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries and<br>
fillers are used. In general, the content in the water-dispersible granules<br>
amounts to between  10 and 90% by weight.  In addition,  the active<br>
compound formulations mentioned comprise, if appropriate, the tackifiers,<br>
wetting agents, dispersants, emulsiflers, preservatives, antifreeze agents,<br>
solvents, fillers, colorants, carriers, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and<br>
pH or viscosity regulators which are customary in each case.<br>
For use, the formulations, which are in commercially available form, are, if appropriate, diluted in a customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, soil granules, granules for spreading and sprayable solutions, are conventionally not diluted any further with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The active compounds can be applied to the plants, parts of the plants, seeds of the plants or the area under cultivation (tilled soil), preferably to the green plants and parts of the plants and, if desired, additionally to the tilled soil.<br><br>
A possible use is the joint application of the active compounds in the form of tank mixes, where the concentrated formulations of the individual active substances, in the form of their optimal formulations, are mixed jointly with water in the tank, and the spray mixture obtained is applied.<br>
A joint herbicidal formulation of the combination according to the invention of the components A) and B) has the advantage that it can be applied more easily because the amounts of the components have already been adjusted with respect to one another to the correct ratio. Moreover, the auxiliaries of the formulation can be selected to suit each other in the best possible way, while a tank mix of various formulations may result in undesirable combinations of auxiliaries.<br>

B.       Biological Examples<br>
Outdoors, crop plants were grown on plots of a size of from 5 to 10 m on various soils and under various climatic conditions, and the natural presence of harmful plants and/or their seeds In the soil was utilized for the experiments. The treatment with the compositions according to the invention or the herbicides A) and B) applied individually was carried out after emergence of the harmful and the crop plants, in general at the 2- to<br><br>
4-leaf stage. The active compounds or active compound combinations, formulated as WG, WP or EC, was carried out by the post-emergence method. After 2 to 8 weeks, visual evaluation was carried out in comparison with an untreated comparative group. It was found that the compositions according to the invention have synergistic herbicidai action against economically important mono- and dicotyledonous harmful plants, i.e. that most of the compositions according to the invention have higher, some considerably higher, herbicidai activity than the sum of the activities of the individual herbicides. In addition, the herbicidai activities of the compositions according to the invention exceed the expected values according to Colby. In contrast, the treatment caused insignificant, if any, damage to the crop plants.<br>
If the obsen/ed activity values of the mixtures already exceed the formal sum of the values for the trials with individual applications, they also exceed the expected value according to Colby which is calculated using the following formula (of. S. R. Colby; in Weeds 15 (1967) pp. 20 to 22):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
