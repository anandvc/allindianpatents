				<td>Process for the preparation of 4-azasteroids<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4-azasteroids of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein R1, R2, R4, Q7, R9, Q11, R16 and COOR are as defined below.<br>
The three step process comprises (i) a haloform reaction of a 17-acetyl steroid converting the acetyl group into a -COOR group, (ii) subsequent ozonolysis of the A-ring and (iii) re-closure of the A-ring by reaction with an appropriate nitrogen compound of formula H2NR4 to afford a compound of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I are key intermediates for the production of pharmaceutically active 4-azasteroids, e.g. 17-substituted-4-aza-5a,17p-androsten-3-ones, among them Finasteride (Proscar1*), showing powerful 5<x-reductase inhibition useful in the treatment of acne alopecia and benign prostatic hypertrophy.></x-reductase>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Finasteride (ProscarÂ®)<br>
A detailed investigation on the inhibition activity of 5a-reductase by several 4-azasteroids and their preparation is disclosed in Rasmusson, Gary H. et al. J. Med. Chem. 29,1986, 2298-2315.<br>
Rasmusson, GaryH. etal. obtained 17p-carboxy-5-oxo-A-nor-3,5-secoandrostan-3-oic acid in about 75% yield by oxidation of 3-oxo-4-androstene-17p-carboxyIic acid into using expensive oxidation agents such as NaIC&gt;4 and KMnCV<br>
WO 90/15045 provides a process wherein the A-ring and an unsaturated acyl side chain of a steroid comprising are ozonolyzed simultaneously. The disadvantage of WO 90/15045 is the removal of the unsaturated acyl side chain, which leads to a substantial material loss. In the examples 1 to 3 four carbon and three oxygen atoms or eight carbon atoms respectively are lost compared to the loss of one carbon atom in the instant process. Regarding the principles of "atom economy" introduced by Trost, B.M. (Science, 254,1991,1471) a high loss of atoms in chemical reactions is disadvantageously.<br>
EP-A-0 277 002 discloses in Scheme I the oxidation of several steroids with ruthenium dioxide/sodium periodate in an organic solvent leading to the corresponding acid. However, there is no example for said process and the Scheme contains no further details.<br>
In saturated rigid ring structures like steroids, ring carbon atoms have<br>
either two monovalent substituents or one bivalent substituent attached to a carbon<br>
atom which is part of one ring and has two ring carbon-carbon bonds, or<br>
one monovalent substituent attached to a carbon atom which is part of two condensed<br>
rings and has three ring carbon-carbon bonds.<br>
Each of the two substituents under (a) is in either an equatorial or axial position relative to the ring and may change between axial/equatorial due to ring flipping. However, the position of the two substituents relative to the ring and each other remain fixed, hi structural formulae depicting such ring structures, accordingly to the common numbering of steroid systems, i.e.<br>
(Figure Remove)O' a substituent R"~', wherein n denotes the number of the respective carbon atom C" which is<br>
"below" the other substituent will be identified as being in the a-position (e.g. R1"1 or a-R1) and its bond to the carbon atom Cn is represented by a broken, dotted or dashed line. Accordingly, the substituent Rn~2 attached "above" the other (R"~') is identified as being in the p-position and its bond to the carbon atom Cn is represented by a heavy or bold line or a solid wedge.<br>
Herein, the symbol Qn in structural formulae represents either one bivalent substituent or two monovalent substituents Rn (i.e. Rn'1 or Rn~2).<br>
Where, according to (b), only one monovalent substituent is attached to the ring skeleton (e.g. R9 attached to C9), its relative position is described to be below (i.e. R9"1) or above (i.e. R9"2) of the ring skeleton.<br>

The technical problem to be solved was to provide an industrially applicable process for the preparation of steroidal seco acids wherein the oxidative cleavage of the steroidal A-ring can be separated from the formation of the carboxyl group attached to C17 of the steroidal skeleton. Furthermore the use of expensive agents like NaIO4 should be avoided. A further object of the invention was to establish an economically advantageous reaction sequence for the preparation of 4-azasteroid intermediates of formula I, requiring a minimum of work-up and isolation steps for compounds of formula IV.<br>
The problems above could be solved according to the process of claim 1.<br>
To avoid the drawbacks in the known processes, a process was established which allows formation of the carboxyl group attached to C17 of the steroidal skeleton and purification of the compound of formula III prior to the cleavage of the steroidal A-ring. Since isolated oxidation of the ene-oxo side chain of the compounds disclosed in WO 90/15045 is not possible without infliction of the A-ring, the carboxyl group attached to C17 had to be introduced by a complete different reaction regime and different starting compounds. By subjecting to a haloform reaction compounds of formula II, containing an acetyl group attached to C17, can be converted to compounds of formula III easily and in high yield. The haloform reaction is completely indifferent to the ene-oxo fragment in the steroidal A-ring and compounds of formula III can be purified to comply with requirements for steroid drags. The decoupling of both oxidation steps allows usage of starting compounds of poor quality.<br>
Provided is a process for the preparation of 4-aza-steroidal acids of the formula<br><br>

The NaOH the solution was cooled to 0 to 5 Â°C, and bromine (214.8 g, 1344 mmol, 4.48 eq) was introduced over a period of at least 60 min to form an orange solution of sodium hypobromite. The solution was then stirred an additional 30 min at 0 Â°C prior to use. A three-neck 3 L reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and distillation head is charged, under nitrogen atmosphere, with progesterone (Ila, 94.5 g, 300 mmol, 1.0 eq), tert-butanol (910 mL) and stirred at 25 Â°C. A solution of 30% NaOH (197 g, 1477 mmol, 4.92 eq) and distilled water (474 mL) was then added over a period of 70 min, while the temperature was held at 25 Â°C. The yellow solution was cooled to 0 Â°C before being treated with NaOBr solution over a period of 60 min. The heterogeneous mixÂ­ture was then stirred for 3 h at 0 Â°C.<br>
After completion of the reaction a solution of sodium sulflte (37.8 g, 364 mmol, 1.21 eq) in water (147 mL) was added within 15 min to the cold reaction mixture (slightly exoÂ­thermic).

The organic phase was separated and treated with 40% NaHSO3 (1 x25 mL) to eliminate peroxides, then concentrated on the rotorvapor (35 Â°C and 30 mbar) to give a light yellow product (100 g). The residual aqueous solution was then over a period of 30 min adjusted to pH 3 by treating with 35% HC1 (65 mL) at room temperature, before being extracted with terf-butyl methyl ether (600 mL). Separation of the organic solution, followed by washing with 40% NaHSOa (1X25 mL) to eliminate peroxides and then with water (1 *25 mL). By concentration on a rotorvapor, (35 Â°C, 20 mbar) and drying (16 h) under vacuum 92.7 g (HPLC 72% w/w, 73% area) fine white powder of 17p-carboxy-5-oxo-A-nor-3,5-secoandrostan-3-oic acid (FVa) were obtained.<br>
Example 4: 3-Oxo-4-aza-androst-5-ene-17|3-carboxylic acid (la of formula I with R1 = R2 = R4 = R7-1 = R7'2 = R9 = R1M = R11'2 = R16 = H, COOR = COOH) A three-neck 1000 mL reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a distillation head is charged, under nitrogen atmosphere, with a tert-butyl methyl ether solution of 17p-carboxy-5-oxo-A-nor-3,5-secoandrostan-3-oic acid (FVa, 700 mL). The solvent is distilled under vacuum (100 mbar / bath approx. 60 Â°C) to 1/3 of the initial volume. Acetic acid (760 mL) is then added and distillation continued until acetic acid starts to distil. Ammonium acetate (132.5 g, 1700 mmol, approx. 7 eq) is added and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux (approx. 120 Â°C) within 1 h (bath temp.: approx. 140 Â°C). After 1 h and 2 h, the conversion is checked by TLC. The reaction mixture is then concentrated (40% of acetic acid distilled off). The reaction mixture (yellow-orange suspension) is cooled down within 1 h to approx. 60 Â°C. Water (830 mL) is then slowly added (approx. 1 h) to the reaction mixture at approx. 60 Â°C and the suspension slowly (1 h) cooled to 20 Â°C. After 0.5 h (20 Â°C), the suspension is filtered and the filter cake was washed with water (2x100 mL) and a solution of water/ethanol (1:1; v:v) (2x100 mL). Drying at 80 Â°C (approx. 20 mbar / approx. 16 h) afforded 68.9 g (83% overall yield, assay corrected, from etiocholenic acid) of light tan product of 3~oxo-4-aza-androst-5-ene-17p-carboxylic acid (la) (HPLC 99% area, 95.4% w/w).<br>
Example 5: 3-Oxo-4-aza-androst-5-ene-17p-carboxylic acid (la of formula I with R1 = R2 = R4 = R7-' = R7'2 = R9 = R1 'â¢' = R11'2 = R16 = H, COOR = COOH) To the cone, solution of 17p-carboxy-5-oxo-A-nor-3,5-secoandrostan-3~oic acid (Wa) (450 g, 1.33 mol), 2100 mL of acetic acid are added and ethyl acetate is distilled off. The cooled mixture is then transferred, under nitrogen atmosphere, to a three-neck 10 L reactor, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a distillation head, and than charged with ammonium acetate (560 g, 7.2 mol). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux within 1 h and than cooled down within 0.5 h to 60 Â°C. Water (3360 mL) is then slowly added and the suspension slowly cooled to 20 Â°C, After 0.5 h, the suspension is filtered and the filter cake was washed with water (2x840 mL) and a mixture of water/ethanol [v:v, 1:1] (3x840 mL). Drying at 50Â°C (approx. 20 mbar / approx. 16 h) affords 355 g (74.5% overall yield) of white to light tan of 3-oxo-4-aza-androst-5-ene-17p-carboxylic acid (la) at a purity of about 100%,<br>
Comparative example 1:17p-Carboxy-5-oxo-A-nor-3,5-secoandrostan-3-oicacid (Formula I, R1 = R2 = R7"1 = R7'2 = R9 = R1M = RIW = R16 = H, COOR = COOH) A three-neck 1000 mL reactor, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a device for pH-controlled NaOH addition and a bubble counter, is purged with nitrogen and then charged with 200 mL of deionized water, 9.7 g of NaHCO3 (115.5 mmol), 16.2 g of etiocholenic acid (50 mmol) and 58 mg of RuCla'HaO (0.37 mmol) and 16 mL of acetonitrile. The slurry is cooled down to 10 Â°C under vigorous stirring (approx. 1000 rpm). The solution is first adjusted to pH 8.0 by addition of NaOH (30%). A solution of 105.9 g of OXONEÂ® (345 mmol, monopersulfate compound 2KHSOs-KHSO4-K2SO4, from Aldrich) in 425 mL of deionized water is added to the stirred suspension within 3.5 h, while the mixture is maintained between pH 8.0 and 8.4 by addition of 30% NaOH solution. The reaction mixture is aged for 1.5 h. After complete conversion of etiocholenic acid, 4.3 g of NaHSOj (40 mmol) is added. The reaction mixture is wanned up to 60 Â°C for 1 h (colour changes from brown to light green) and then cooled to 20 Â°C. CH2Cl2 (254 mL) is added. The pH is adjusted to 1.5 by the addition of cone. HC1. After phase separation the water phase is extracted with 80 mL QHkCla. The combined organic layers are then filtered, dried over NaaSO^ Residual water is removed from the moist product at 55 Â°C under vacuum. Yield is approx. 90%, by HPLC, purity is approx. 60%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
