THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
AN ARTICLE FOR CLEANSING SURFACES<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
- 1 -<br>
PUCKER RESISTANT COSMETIC SACHET<br>
The invention concerns inflatable sachets containing an effervescent dry powder activatable to release gases and 5  thereby outwardly billow the sachet.<br>
Cleansing products have traditionally been marketed in the form of bar soaps, shower gels and mousses, the lather being generated by mechanical and aerosol dispensers.  Mechanical implements have been used by consumers to assist in lather 10  formation and physical removal of dirt through scrubbing. Wash cloths have been the implement of choice throughout recent history.<br>
New formats for cleansing hold great consumer appeal.  For instance, surfactant and conditioner compositions have been 15  layered into apertured wipes such as disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,280,757 (McAtee et al.) .  Open-mesh sponges such as described in U.S. Patent 6,066,607 (Gordon et al.) have assisted in generating foam from shower gels thereby improving speed and quality of lathering.<br>
- 20  U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) describes a<br>
substantially dry, disposable personal care article wherein a surfactant system is dried onto a water-insoluble non-woven or similar substrate.  A second generation of dual layered towelette has been reported.  See WO 0 0/42961 25  (Smith), WO 01/08542 (Cen et al.), WO 01/08640 (Smith et<br>
al.),   WO 01/08641 (Lorenzi et al.), WO 01/08655 (Phipps et al.), WO 01/08656 (Lorenzi et al. ) , WO 01/08657 (Lorenzi et al.) and WO 01/08658 (Cawkwell et al.) all describing<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
disposable personal cleansing towelettes with lathering surfactant on at least a two layer cloth with one layer being a high loft substrate.  Consumers are expected to place the towelette under water to generate a surfactant 5  lather.<br>
Another approach is described in U.S. Patent 6,063,3 90 (Farrell et al.) which reports a wiping article structured as a pouch containing an effervescent cleanser composition. At least one of the pouch walls are water permeable.  When 10  wetted with water, the composition components of an acid material and an alkaline material effervesce to generate carbon dioxide, as well as exuding copious amounts of lather from a surfactant component.  A plumped "pillow" arises from the effervescent action.<br>
15  EP 0 836 842 Bl (Moore et al.) discloses oval shaped<br>
disposable non-woven cleaning articles. These are formed of hydro-entangled fibers wherein entanglement is oriented in a direction parallel to the major axis of the oval.<br>
Elongate shaped pouches are particularly suitable for 20  gripping; they tend to more ergonomically fit within the hand.  For the present invention, an effervescent sachet system was sought which would be easily grippable.<br>
A problem encountered with sachets formed from non-woven materials is their tendency to pucker.  When the dry 25  effervescent composition is activated with water, the<br>
resultant evolution of gases inflates the sachet into a bulging pillow arrangement.  Deformation of the sachet walls results in a substantial pucker of the pillow configuration.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
Both for aesthetic and ergonomic reasons, the pucker is undesirable.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cosmetic article with an activatable effervescent 5  cleansing system which upon inflation by effervescent gases causes the article to inflate but avoids deformation and puckering of the article.<br>
It is to be noted that the subsequently described invention is broader than the objects or technical problems it is 10  directed to solve.<br>
According to a first aspect an article is provide for cleansing surfaces, the article including:<br>
1 a curvilinear pouch formed from a plurality of<br>
walls, at least one of the walls being water<br>
15	permeable, and at least one of the walls being<br>
formed from at least one web of non-woven entangled fibers, the fibers being entangled in a direction perpendicular to a major longitudinal axis of the web; and<br>
2 0	- an effervescent cleanser composition which is an<br>
anhydrous dry solid activable by water to generate gases, the composition being held within the pouch, and upon generation of gases the pouch walls billowing outwardly.<br>
25  Further objects, features and advantages of .the ..present invention will become more readily apparent from consideration of the drawings, in which:<br><br>

0	invention; and<br>
-	Fig. 5 is a front elevational view of a fourth<br>
embodiment of a sachet according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Now it has been found that proper orientation of fibers in a 5  non-woven web forming a wall of the pouch can avoid the<br>
problem of puckering.  Upon release of gases through water activation of the effervescent composition, the walls of the pouch billow outwardly.  Directed orientation of the entangled fibers forming  a weh which is at  least  part  of the 0  pouch wall allows the system to stretch, thereby avoiding deformation and any substantial puckering.<br>
Fig. l illustrates a first embodiment wherein the pouch is oval shaped.<br>
The pouch 2 has walls formed by a first spun lace web 4 and 5  a second meltblown composite web 6, the latter being bonded to a high loft sheet 8.  The webs forming webs 4 and 6 are non-woven entangled fiber matrices.  Fig. 2 best illustrates<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
_   5   _<br>
by cross-section the several webs constituting the walls. Chamber 10 formed between the first and second webs 4, 6 serves to confine a powdered effervescent composition 12. Webs 4 and 6 are ultrasonically sealed along a 5  circumferential track 14 to insure no loss of the powdered composition.<br>
Pouch 2 is defined by a major axis M oriented in a longitudinal direction and a minor axis N oriented in a lateral direction, the major axis being longer than the 0  minor one.<br>
Fig. 3 is a second embodiment of the invention.  It illustrates a crescent-shaped sachet 16.  Major and minor axes, (M' and N'), are outlined on the Figure.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a third embodiment according to the 5  present invention.  Sachet 22 along one edge has a<br>
sinusoidal shape 24 and along an opposite edge a straight configuration 26. Major and minor axes are identified as M' and N" .<br>
Fig. 3 and 4 provide particularly useful curvilinear edges 0  because of their more grippable and less slip-prone<br>
configuration relative to that of an oval.  Yet the problem of puckering is particularly aggravated in configurations having concave edges such as identified by 18 and 28.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a fourth embodiment.  Sachet 32 at the 5  ends of the major axis M' ' '   has a straight edge 36 and at opposite ends a rounded edge 34.  Minor axis N'' traverses the major axis.<br><br>

Copious foam is generated when pouch 2 is wetted with water, much in the same manner as a toilet bar is lathered. Physically, the pouch is constructed in an oval shape with a size fittable within a human hand thereby simulating a 5  toilet bar.<br>
The term "major axis' refers to the longitudinal direction or length and is defined as the direction parallel to the longitudinal center line of the sachet.  Normally the major axis coincides with the material direction (MD) along which<br>
10  the web is produced.  In other words, as fibers are laid down they are conveyed as a web away from the depositing source in a MD movement.  The term "minor axis" refers to the lateral direction or width, and is defined as the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal center line of<br>
15  the sachet.  Normally the minor axis coincides with the cross direction (CD) arranged orthogonal to the MD along which the web is produced.<br>
Tensile Strength of nonwovens is ordinarily strongest in the machine direction.  Entanglement oriented webs of the<br>
2	0  present invention seek to improve strength in the CD<br>
relative to the MD length.  However, the resultant oriented webs will not necessarily exhibit higher tensile strength in the CD than MD length; but tensile strength differences will have been narrowed.  For instance, a spun lace fabric may be 25  formed from fiber deposition that is CD to MD in a tensile strength ratio of circa 1:4.  Subsequent hydroentanglement orientation enhances the ratio to circa 1:2.  Preferably orientation of entangled fibers will increase tensile strength by at least 20%, more preferably by at least 50%,<br>
3	0  and optimally by at least 10 0% in CD versus MD value.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
Typical dimensions for the major axis may range from about 2 0 mm to about 3 00 mm, preferably from about 30 to about 100 mm.  Dimensions of the minor axis may range from about 30 to about 85 mm, preferably from about 20 to about 50 mm.<br>
5  Orientation of the fibers of the present invention is not limited to any particularly technique.  In fact, any technique known in the art can be employed to gain the desired orientation effect.<br>
The pouch comprises at least one web of entangled fibers.<br>
0  The entangled fibers are entangled in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the major axis of the pouch.  The preferred method of manufacturing entangled fibers utilizes a process known as hydroentangling.  A hydroentangled web that is strong and*durable is produced by traversing material fibers<br>
5  with high energy jet streams of water in order to interlock the fibers.  Other high pressure fluids can be used in place of water.<br>
Although hydroent angling is preferred as the method of producing the entangled web, other methods can alternatively<br>
0  be employed.  Needlepunching is an example of a method which can be employed.  In this method, barbed needles are punched through the web, hooking tufts of fibers across it and thereby bonding it in the needlepunched areas.  Another method which can be utilized is thermal bonding, in which<br>
5  the fibers are of thermoplastic material, or have an outer layer of thermoplastic material, and are bonded together in discrete spots by heat.  A web produced in this way is unlikely to be as soft as one produced by hydroentangling,<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
or needlepunching, and it may have a substantial proportion of completely loose fibers.<br>
Yet another method involves wet-laying a mixture of fibers and chemical binder, somewhat in the manner employed, for 5  example, in paper making.  Yet a further method is carding, in which staple fibers are opened, cleaned, aligned and formed into a continuous unbonded web.  While hydroentangling, and chemically, thermally, mechanically bonded materials and carded materials are representative of 10  the technologies which can be incorporated in the present invention, these do not exhaust all the possibilities. Other technologies such as embossing, creping and aperturing can be incorporated into the manufacture of the pouch.<br>
Web 6 may be a single meltblown web, but preferably it is a 15  combination of several layers forming a composite web.  One embodiment utilizes the three layers of spunbond/meltblown/ spunbond (SMS) and another utilizes four layers representing spunbond/meltblown/meltblown/spunbond (SMMS) construction. In these systems the meltblown fibers are very compact and 2 0  act as a barrier against loss of powder.  The spunbond layers are provided for strength and softness.<br>
The meltblown web can be any meltblown web made from a thermoplastic polymer having a melting point greater than about 50°C.  A preferred polymer is polypropylene, which is 25  the most commonly used polymer for making meltblown webs. Other suitable polymers include poly(butylene terephthalate) , polycaprolactam, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polyethylene.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
The process for making meltblown webs is well known in the art and is used extensively for manufacturing a wide variety of commercial nonwoven products.  Representative examples of the meltblowing process are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5  3,978,185 to Buntin et al. dated August 31, 1976; U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,298,649 to Meitner dated November 3, 1981; and U.S. Patent No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al. dated July 11, 1978, all herein incorporated by reference.  It will be appreciated, however, that other meltblowing processes will 10  produce webs suitable for purposes of this invention.  The meltblown web can be combined or laminated to other supporting webs, such as spunbonded webs, in order to impart strength or other attributes to the product.<br>
The basis weight for a single sheet of the meltblown base 15  webs of this invention can range from about 20 to about 300 grams per square meter.  Preferably the basis weight will be from about 80 to about 250, and most preferably from about 100 to about 2 00 grams per square meter.<br>
Spunbonding entails extruding a multiplicity of continuous 2 0  thermoplastic polymer strands through a multiplicity of die orifices in a downward direction onto a moving surface where the extruded strands are collected in randomly distributed fashion.  The randomly deposited strands are then bonded together in a heated nip to provide sufficient integrity to 25  the resulting nonwoven web of continuous fibers.  Spunbonded webs are characterized by a high strength/weight ratio, isotropic strength, high porosity, and good abrasion resistance.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
Meltblowing differs from spunbonding in that the extruded polymer strands are broken up and dispersed into individual fibers by a forced air stream before being deposited onto the collecting surface.  In addition, the fibers are 5  substantially cooled by the air so that they do not<br>
significantly crystallize and/or bond together.  Bonding of the web to retain integrity and strength occurs as a separate downstream operation.<br>
A most preferred material for the second web 6 is a non-0  woven meltblown/spunbond substrate available from the Polyprop Corporation.<br>
The first web 4 preferably is either a spun lace or a carded/chemically bonded non-woven water-insoluble material. Particularly preferred is a cloth NC008 (Image Spun Lace) 5  available from the PGI Corporation.<br>
When present, a high loft sheet may be utilized as the water-permeable wall.  As used herein, "high loft" means<br>
that the sheet has a density of from about 0.00005 g/cm to<br>
about 0.1 g/cm , preferably from about 0.0 01 g/cm to about<br>
0  0.09 g/cm and a thickness of from about 0.1 cm to about 5 cm.<br>
As used herein, "nonwoven" means that the layer does not comprise fibers which are woven into a fabric. The term "curvilinear" means that at least one edge defining the<br>
5  pouch is -a- curved surface.	-Pref erab-ly the .pouch,, exhibits ...no<br>
squared corners.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
For purposes of this invention, the most preferred high loft material is a needle punched composite sold by Union Wadding Corporation.<br>
Sachets of the present invention may be produced by 5  depositing a charge of effervescent powder through a funnel nozzle onto an oriented nonwoven web as it moves in a horizontal manner.  Downstream a similarly oriented hydro-entangled web is unfurled from a roll and travels in a direction above and parallel to that of the first web.  The 10  parallel webs and deposited effervescent powder then pass underneath a stamping station which heat seals in an oval pattern the first and second webs together with the effervescent powder charge between the web walls. Subsequently, a cutter die punches out the heat sealed oval<br>
»<br>
15  article.<br>
One or more of the articles may then be packaged within a moisture impermeable outer package such as a laminated foil bag to prevent activation of the effervescent system during storage.<br>
20  Ultrasonic welding may be employed as an alternative to heat-sealing of the first and second substrates together. Thread stitching, glue application or other closure mechanisms may also be utilized.<br>
A first component of compositions 12 within the pouch is 25  that of an acidic material.  Suitable for this purpose are any acids, and preferably those present in dry solid form.<br>
Especially appropriate are C2-C20 organic mono- and poly-<br>
carboxylic acids and especially alpha- and beta-<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids; C2-C20 organophosphorus acids such<br>
as phytic acid; C2-C20 organosulfur acids such as toluene<br>
sulfonic acid; and peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide. Typical hydroxycarboxylic acids include adipic, glutaric,<br>
5  succinic, tartaric, malic, maleic, lactic, salicylic and citric acids as well as acid forming lactones such as gluconolactone and glucarolactone.  Most preferred is citric acid.  Also suitable as acid material may be encapsulated acids.  Typical encapsulating material may include water<br>
0  soluble synthetic or natural polymers such as polyacrylates (e.g. encapsulating polyacrylic acid), cellulosic gums, polyurethane and polyoxyalkylene polymers.<br>
By the term "acid" is meant any substance which when dissolved ±n deionized water at 1% concentration will have a<br>
5  pH of less than 7, preferably less than 6.5, optimally less than 5.  These acids preferably at 25°C are in solid form, i.e. having melting points no less than 25°C.  Concentrations of the acid should range from about 0.5 to about 80%, preferably from about 10 to about 65%, optimally from about<br>
0  20 to about 45% by weight of the total composition.<br>
A second component of compositions within the pouch is that of an alkaline material.  The alkaline material is a substance which can generate a gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen or oxygen, i.e. effervesce, when contacted with 5  water and the acidic material.  Suitable alkaline materials include anhydrous salts of carbonates and bicarbonates, alkaline peroxides (e.g. sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate) and azides (e.g. sodium azide).  Preferably the alkaline material is sodium or potassium bicarbonate.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
Amounts of the alkaline material may range from about 1 to about 80%, preferably from about 5 to about 49%, more preferably from about 15 to about 40%, optimally from about 20 to about 35% by weight of the total composition.<br>
5  By the term "anhydrous" is meant the presence of no more than about 15%, preferably no more than about 5% and optimally no more than 1% water by weight of the total composition.  Water of hydration is not considered to be water for purposes of the anhydrous definition.  However, it 10  is preferred to minimize, preferably to eliminate any water of hydration.<br>
Advantageously the combined amount of acidic and alkaline materials will be at least about 1.5%, preferably from about 40 to about 95%, optimally from about 60 to about 8 0% by 15  weight of the total composition.<br>
An optimal further component of compositions according to the present invention is that of a surfactant, preferably a dry surfactant solid at 20°C.  Most suitable for the present invention is sodium cocoyl isethionate.  Other useful<br>
2 0  surfactants include sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium<br>
lauroyl sarcosinate and sodium lauryl sulfate.  Surfactants may be of the anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric, zwitterionic varieties and combinations thereof.  Amounts of the surfactant may range from about 0.1 to about 3 0%,<br>
25  preferably from about 1 to about 30%, optimally from about 8 to about 2 0% by weight of the total composition.<br>
A variety of skin benefit agents may be included to improve afterfeel properties.  Advantageously these substances will<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
be available as anhydrous dry powders.  Alternatively these substances may be liquids deposited upon or into a powdered substrate (e.g. calcium silicate or zeolite) to achieve a resultant dry flowing powder.  Within the skin benefit agent<br>
5  scope are several categories of materials.  These include emollients, antiaging actives, antibacterials and fungicides, skin lighteners, sunscreens and combinations thereof.  Amounts of the skin benefit agents may range from about 0.001 to about 40%, preferably from about 0.1 to about<br>
0  20%, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 10%, optimally between about 1 and about 5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Emollients may be in the form of natural or synthetic esters, silicone oils, hydrocarbons, starches, fatty acids<br>
»<br>
5  and mixtures thereof.  Typically the emollient may range in concentration from about 0.1 to about 35% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and nonvolatile variety.  The term "volatile" as used herein 0  refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature (25°C).  Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms.<br>
5  Linear volatile silicone materials generally have<br>
viscosities less than about 5 centistokes at 25°C while cyclic-materials typically have-viscosities of less than about 10 centistokes.<br><br>
WO 03/070211<br><br>
PCT/EP03/00794<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
