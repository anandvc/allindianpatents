				<td>Compositions For Cleansing Skin And Treating Acne<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions that ate useful for cleansing<br>
skin and for treating acne. The compositions contain salicylic acid, are low in<br>
alcohol, physically stable, and do not leave the skin feeling dry after use.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Acne is a common disorder characterized by blackheads, whileheads,<br>
papules, pustules, cysts, and various nodules and scars. Acne is commonly seen on<br>
the face and back of the upper arm. It is theorized that acne is caused, at least in<br>
part, by bacteria such as Propionbacterium acnes. For this reason, anti-acne<br>
products frequently contain active ingredients that kill or inhibit the growth of<br>
bacteria. Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are well known for their use as anti-<br>
acne active ingredients.<br>
Acne can be quite unsightly and frequently causes embarrassment to the<br>
sufferer. For this reason, as well as for good hygiene, many people use skin<br>
cleansing products and anti-acne products on a daily basis. Skin cleansing products<br>
include astringents, toners, and the like. Anti-acne products include ointments,<br>
lotions, and the like. Astringent and toner formulations sometimes include anti-acne<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Skin cleansing products and anti-acne products are known to contain water.<br>
Salicylic acid is poorly soluble in water. Therefore, when it is desirable to formulate<br>
salicylic acid in a cleansing product or an anti-acne product, keeping the salicylic<br>
acid in solution becomes a challenge. The formulations frequently are physically<br>
unstable, that is, the salicylic acid precipitates out of solution. Due to its poor water<br>
solubility, salicylic acid frequently is formulated with a relatively high amount of<br>
ethyl alcohol to aid in solubilizing the salicylic acid. As used herein, the term<br>
relatively high amount of ethyl alcohol means from 40 to 80 percent by weight ethyl<br>
alcohol, based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
The ethyl alcohol in the salicylic acid formulations is also utilized to aid in<br>
creating formulations that dry quickly on the skin. The formulations tend to dry<br>
quickly due to the evaporation of the ethyl alcohol. Unfortunately, evaporation of<br><br>
ethyl alcohol from the skin tends to dry the skin. In general, people like their skin to<br>
feel moisturized after cleansing. Therefore, there is a need for a skin cleansing<br>
product that contains an anti-acne active ingredient, but does not make the skin feel<br>
dry after use.<br>
Attempts have been made to develop alcohol-free skin cleansers that contain<br>
anti-acne active ingredients, however several problems are associated with the<br>
formulations. One problem is that it is difficult to make a stable formulation, as<br>
salicylic acid will tend to precipitate out of solution. Another problem is that the<br>
formulations do not dry as fast, due to the lack of ethyl alcohol. When alcohol-free<br>
formulations completely dry, there is frequently a sticky feeling left on the skin.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,024,941 discloses an external skin treatment<br>
compositions comprising vitamin A and at least one stabilizer for the vitamin A.<br>
Suitable stabilizers include a salicylic acid compound and polyethylene glycol. The<br>
compositions are taught as being useful for the treatment of keratodermatitis and the<br>
prevention of or treatment of dermal aging. There is no teaching or suggestion of<br>
physically stable skin cleansing compositions containing an anti-acne ingredient and<br>
low levels of alcohol or the benefits thereof.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a skin cleansing product that<br>
contains an anti-acne active ingredient, is physically stable, and does not make the<br>
skin feel dry or sticky after use.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have discovered mat it is possible to provide a skin cleansing product,<br>
which contains an anti-acne active ingredient, is physically stable, and does not<br>
make the skin feel dry or sticky after use. The present invention provides a skin<br>
cleansing composition including: from about 0.1 to about 5 percent by weight of at<br>
least one anti-acne active ingredient; from about 1 to about 25 percent by weight of<br>
at least one alcohol; from about 0.1 to about 15 percent by weight of at least one<br>
solubilizer, and water.<br><br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention relates to a physically stable skin cleansing composition<br>
including: from about 0.1 to about 5 percent by weight of at least one anti-acne<br>
active ingredient; from about 1 to about 25 percent by weight of at least one alcohol;<br>
from about 0.1 to about 15 percent by weight of at least one solubilizer, and water.<br>
In the context of this inveniton the term "physicary stable" means compositions mat are<br>
clear and do not phase separate or form a precipitate at roon temperature.<br>
The skin cleansing compositions of the present invention include at least one<br>
anti-acne active ingredient. Suitable anti-acne active ingredients include, but are not<br>
limited to, salicylic acid, sulfur, lactic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, urea,<br>
resorcinol, N-acetylcysteine, retinoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, octopirox, triclosan,<br>
azelaic acid, phenoxyethanol, phenoxypropanol, flavinoids, derivatives thereof, and<br>
combinations thereof.. Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide are preferred. Salicylic<br>
acid is most preferred. The amount of anti-acne active ingredient in the composition<br>
of the invention may range from about 0.1 to about 5, preferably from about 0.5 to<br>
about 2 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
At least one alcohol is included in the compositions of this invention. The<br>
alcohol may be selected from ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, t-butyl alcohol, and<br>
combinations thereof. Ethanol is preferred. The amount of alcohol in the<br>
compositions of the invention is high enough that the compositions dry quickly and<br>
do not leave the skin feeling sticky, yet, not so high that the skin feels dry after<br>
cleansing with the compositions. The amount of alcohol in the compositions of the<br>
invention may range from about 1 to about 25, preferably from about 5 to about 20,<br>
more preferably from about 10 to about 20 percent by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the composition.<br>
At least one solubilizer is included in the compositions of the invention to<br>
stabilize the composition so that the anti-acne active ingredient does not precipitate<br>
out of solution under normal storage conditions. Suitable solubilizers include, but<br>
are not limited to, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol ("PEG"), polysorbate-20, porysorbate-40, isoceteth-15, isoceteth-20,<br>
isoceteth-30, sorbeth-20, sorbeth-40, PEG-40 castor oil, and combinations thereof.<br><br>
The most preferred solubilizer is PEG. It has been discovered that the<br>
number of repeating units in the PEG effects the performance of PEG as a<br>
solubilizer for anti-acne active ingredients. If the number of repeating units is too<br>
high or too low, the formulation will turn cloudy, and will not be physically stable.<br>
Generally, suitable PEGs include PEG"s having from about 20 to about 75 repeating<br>
ethylene grycol units, preferably 20, 32, 40, 55, 60, and 75, more preferably, 20, 32,<br>
and 40, most preferably 32 repeating ethylene glycol units. The amount of<br>
solubilizer in the compositions of the invention may range from about 0.1 to about<br>
15, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10, more preferably from about 1 to about 5<br>
percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Water is also included in the compositions of the invention. The amount of<br>
water utilized will depend on the amounts of the required components and any<br>
optional components in the formulation. Generally, the amount of water may range<br>
from about 60 to about 99, preferably from about 75 to about 85 percent by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of me composition.<br>
The skin cleansing compositions of the invention optionally include<br>
humectants, UV absorbers, pH adjusting agents, skin soothers, emollients,<br>
preservatives, conditioning agents, and fragrances.<br>
Emollients which can be included in the compositions of the invention<br>
function by their ability to remain on the skin surface or in the stratum corneum to<br>
act as lubricants, to reduce flaking, and to improve the skin appearance. Typical<br>
emollients include fatty esters, fatty alcohols, mineral oil, polyether siloxane<br>
copolymers and the like. Examples of suitable emollients include, but are not<br>
limited to, polypropylene glycol ("PPG")-15 stearyl ether, PPG-10 cetyl ether,<br>
steareth-10, oleth-8, PPG-4 lauryl ether, vitamin E acetate, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate,<br>
lanolin, and combinations thereof. Vitamin B acetate, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate and<br>
combinations thereof are preferred. When utilized, the emollient can be present in<br>
an amount from about 0.01 to about 5, preferably from about 0.1 to about 2, more<br>
preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 percent by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the composition.<br>
Polyhydric alcohols can be utilized as humectants in the compositions of the<br>
invention. The humectants aid in increasing the effectiveness of the emollient,<br><br>
reduce scaling, stimulate removal of built-up scale and improve skill feel. Suitable<br>
polyhydric alcohols include, but are not limited to, glycerol (also known as<br>
glycerin), polyalkylene glycols, alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including<br>
propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and<br>
derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-dibutylene<br>
glycol, 1,2,6,-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures<br>
thereof. Glycerin is preferred. When utilized, the humectant is present in an amount<br>
from about 0.1 to about 5, preferably from about 0.1 to about 3 percent by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Skin soothers may be added to the compositions of the invention. Suitable<br>
skin soothers include, but are not limited to, panthenol, bisabolol, allantoin, and<br>
combinations thereof. When utilized, the skin soother is present in an amount from<br>
about 0.01 to about 0.75, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 percent by weight,<br>
based on me total weight of the composition.<br>
Conditioning agents may also be added to the compositions of the invention.<br>
Suitable conditioning agents include, but are not minted to, dimethicone propyl PG-<br>
betaine, dimethicone copolyols, polyquatemium-10, and combinations thereof.<br>
When utilized, the conditioning agent is present in an amount from about 0.01 to<br>
about 1, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.5 percent by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the composition.<br>
It has also been discovered that the pH of the compositions according to the<br>
invention has an effect on the physical stability of the composition. Generally, the<br>
pH of the compositions of the invention ranges from about 3 to about 4, preferably<br>
from about 3.25 to about 3.75., most preferably about 3.6. The pH may be adjusted<br>
through the use of cosmetically acceptable pH adjusters, such as, but not limited to<br>
sodium citrate. The amount of pH adjuster utilized will depend on the initial pH of<br>
the composition and the volume of composition to be adjusted. Generally, the<br>
amount of pH adjuster utilized may range from about 0.1 to about 0.5, preferably<br>
form about 0.2 to about 0.4 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
UV absorbers may be added to the compositions of the invention. Suitable<br>
UV absorbers include, but are not limited to, benzophenone and its derivatives,<br><br>
cinnamic acid and its derivatives, azoles, imidazoles and the like. When utilized, the<br>
amount of UV absorber ranges from about 0.001 to about 0.01 percent by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Botanicals, such as aloe barbadensis extract, chamomile extract, thyme<br>
extract, rosemary extract, and the like may also be useful in the compositions of the<br>
invention. When utilized, botanicals are present at from about 0.01 to about 1,<br>
preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 percent by weight, based on the total weight<br>
of the composition.<br>
Sensates, such as menthyl lactate, menthol, camphor, peppermint, eucalyptus<br>
oil, menthoxypropanediol, and the like may also be useful in the compositions of the<br>
invention. When utilized, sensates are present at from about 0.01 to about 1,<br>
preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 percent by weight, based on the total weight<br>
of the composition.<br>
Preservatives are typically added to compositions to inhibit the growth of<br>
microbial organisms. Suitable preservatives to be added to the compositions of the<br>
invention include benzoic acid, and Quatenrium-15, available commercially as<br>
"Dowicil 200" from the Dow Chemical Corporation of Midland, Michigan. Benzoic<br>
acid is preferred. When utilized, the preservative is present in an amount from about<br>
0.01 to about 1, preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 percent by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the composition.<br>
Any fragrance may be added to the compositions of the invention for<br>
aesthetic purposes. Suitable fragrances include, but are not limited to, eucalyptus<br>
oil, camphor synthetic, peppermint oil, clove oil, lavendar, chamomile and the like.<br>
When utilized, fragrances are present in an amount from about 0.05 to about 0.5,<br>
preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.3 percent by weight, based on the total weight<br>

to the skin utilizing cotton swabs, cloths, and the like. Alternatively, the<br><br>
composition may be absorbed onto wipes, which is known technology, and sold as<br>
cleansing wipes.<br>
The advantages of the invention and specific embodiments of the<br>
compositions prepared in accordance with the present invnetion are illustrated by the<br>
following examples. It will be understood, however, that the invention is not<br>
confined to the specific limitations set forth in the individual examples, but rather to<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
Examplel<br>
In the example, the oil phase and water phase were prepared separately, men<br>
combined. The samples were mixed and stored at room temperature. Samples were<br><br>
monitored visually. For a sample to be considered useful, the formulation should be<br>
clear and no precipitate should form at room temperature. The procedure for<br>
preparing the samples was as follows (all amounts are on a percent by weight basis):<br>
The oil phase was prepared by combining Vitamin E acetate, Arlamol® E,<br>
and Dow Coming 345 fluid and mixing well. The water phase was prepared by<br>
melting PEG 1450 in a glass beaker, adding salicylic acid and mixing until<br>
dissolved, adding ethyl alcohol and mixing. In a separate container Carbomer EX-<br>
518 was added to water with mixing. The solution containing the alcohol was men<br>
added to the solution containing the water and mixed to form the water phase. The<br>
oil phase was then combined with the water phase and mixed. The following<br>
samples were prepared:<br><br>
The samples were checked for physical stability. The results were as<br>
follows:<br>
Sample 1 - formed a cloudy emulsion, took over 3 hours to phase separate<br>
Sample 2 - salicylic acid precipitated out when the oil phase and the water phase<br>
were combined<br>
Sample 3 - formed a cloudy emulsion, took less than 3 hours to phase separate<br>
Sample 4 - formed a cloudy emulsion, took less than 3 hours to phase separate<br>
Sample 5 - formed a cloudy emulsion, phase separated rapidly upon pH adjustment<br><br>
Sample 6 - formed a cloudy emulsion, phase separated within 5 minutes<br>
Sample 7 - formed a cloudy emulsion, phase separated<br>
Example 2<br>
The following formulations were prepared by the following process:<br>
A beacker was charged with water and glycerin and mixed. An alcohol<br>
phase was prepared by melting PEG 1450, adding salicylic acid and mixing until<br>
dissolved. Alcohol was added to this solution with mixing. An oil phase was<br>
prepared by combining vitamin E acetate, vitamin A pahnitate, fragrance, and<br>
Procetyl® AWS or Arlasolve® and mixing. The alcohol phase was men added to<br>
the water and glycerin and mixed. The oil phase was men added to the<br>
water/alcohol phase mixture and mixed.<br><br>
The samples were checked for physical stability. The results were as<br>
follows:<br>
Sample 8 - opaque emulsion<br>
Sample 9 - opaque emulsion<br>
Sample 10 -clear solution<br>
Sample 11 - cloudy yellow oil phase, phase separated.<br><br>
Sample 10 was physically stable at room temperature, and was clear.<br>
Example 3 Accelerated Aging Studies<br>
Storage conditions vary due to season and geographic location. It is<br>
therefore useful to test lead candidate formulations at both elevated temperatures<br>
(summer storage conditions) and reduced temperatures (winter storage conditions).<br>
The following formulations were tested for accelerated aging. For these<br>
studies, samples were stored at 4°C, room temperature (~25°C), 40°C, and 50°C. In<br>
addition, samples were stored at -4°C for a minimum of 24 hours, men stored at<br>
room temperature for 24 hours, and evaluated. This freeze/thaw testing was<br>
repeated for a total of three cycles. Samples were inspected visually. Samples<br>
failed if they phase separated, became cloudy, formed a precipitate, or changed<br>
color.<br><br>
The results are as follows:<br>
After 5 days storage, Sample 12 was clear at both 4°C and room temperature,<br>
but turned cloudy at 40°C and very cloudy both at 50°C and after one freeze/thaw<br>
cycle. Sample 13 was clear at both 4°C and room temperature, but turned cloudy at<br>
40°C and very cloudy both at 50°C and after one freeze/thaw cycle. All samples<br><br>
were also sniffed to determine if accelerated aging storage had any adverse effect on<br>
the fragrance. No difference in fragrance scent was noticed in any sample.<br>
Example 4<br>
A base formulation was as follows: a beaker was charged with water and<br>
glycerine and mixed, benzophenone was added and mixed. A pre-mix of melted<br>
PEG-1450, salicylic acid, alcohol, and benzoic acid was made. To the water mixture<br>
the premixed was added and mixed; the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with sodium citrate;<br>
then dyes were added. The base formulation contained the following ingredients (all<br>
in weight percent): 10% ethanol, 1% glycerine, 0.005 % benzopheaoae-4, 0.5 %<br>
salicylic acid, 1% PEG-1450, 80% water, 0.1% benzoic acid, 0.035% FD&amp;C blue #1<br>
(0.1% solution), 0.015% FD&amp;C yellow #10 (0.1% solution), and 0.35% sodium<br>
citrate.<br>
Samples were men made by combining menthyl lactate and fragrance and<br>
heating until the menthyl lactate melted; adding solubilizer and mixing; and adding<br>
the mixture to the base formulation and mixing. The following samples were made<br>
from sub-samples of the base formulation:<br><br>
Samples 17 and 18 wer cloudy. Samples 14, 15, 16, and 19 were clear and<br>
stored for accelerated aging studies. The results were as follows: After 1 day of<br>
storage, all of samples 14, 15, 16 and 19 were clear at 50°C and at room<br>
temperature. Samples 14 and 16 were clear after one freeze/thaw cycle, and samples<br>
15 and 19 were cloudy after one freeze/thaw cycle.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
A large beaker was charged with water, glycerin was added and mixed,<br>
benzophenone was added and mixed, sodium citrate was added and mixed. A<br>
salicylic acid pre-mix was prepared by melting PEG-1450, adding Solubilisant and<br>
heating to approximately 40°C, salicylic acid was added and mixied until the<br>
salicylic acid dissolved. The mixtured was cooled to 40°C, then menthyl lactate was<br>
added and mixed until dissolved, vitamin E acetate was added and mixed, benzoic<br>
acid was added and mixed; alcohol was added and mixed, and fragrance was added<br>
and mixed. The salicylic acid pre-mix was then added to the water solution and<br>
mixed, then dyes were added and mixed.<br>
The sample contained 85.6% water, 1% glycerine, 0.005% benzophenone-4,<br>
1% PEG-1450, 0.5% salicylic acid, 10% ethanol, 0.1% benzoic acid, 0.35% sodium<br>
citrate, 0.044% FD&amp;C blue #1 (0.1% solution), 0.112% FD&amp;C yellow #10 (0.1%<br>
solution), 0.1% menthyl lactate, 0.2% fragrance, 0.1% vitamin E acetate, and 0.9%<br>
Solubilisant LRI. The formulation was one phase and was clear. After 5 weeks<br>
storage, the samples at 4°C, 25°C, 40°C, and 50°C remained clear.<br><br><br><br>
Samples 20, 21, and 22 were clear, and samples 20 and 21 were stored for<br>
accelerated aging studies. The results were as follows: After 4 and 1/2 weeks of<br>
storage, samples 20 and 21 were clear at room temperature, 4°C, 40°C, and 50°C.<br>
Samples 20 and 21 were both clear after three freeze/thaw cycles.<br><br>
Sample 23 was clear, therefore accelerated aging studies were run on it<br>
The results were as follows: After 8 weeks of storage, sample 23 was clear at room<br>
temperature, 4°C, 40°C, and 50°C, and after 3 freeze/thaw cycles.<br>
Sample 24 was opaque, therefore no accelerated aging studies were run on it.<br><br>
Example 7 - Addition Of Dimethicone Containing Compounda<br>
Sub-samples from sample 22 were taken and tested for compatibility with<br>
dimethicone containing compounds. The samples were prepared to see if the<br>
cleansing properties of the formulation would improve upon the addition of<br>
dimethicone containing compounds. The samples were prepared by adding the<br>
silicons containing compound to the sub-sample and mixing. The following<br>
samples were prepared:<br><br>
Sample 25 was cloudy. Sample 27 was slightly hazy. Samples 26, 28 and<br>
29 were clear. Some of the samples were applied to the arm of a person. The skin<br>
did not feel noticeably different after cleansing with these samples than when<br>
cleansed with sample 22. Accelerated aging studies were not performed on these<br>
samples. It was later determined experimentally that the dimethicone containing<br>
compound goes into solution best when added to the salicylic acid pre-mix, just after<br>
the addition of ethanol.<br>
Example 8 - Adjusting Menthyl Lactate and Fragrance Levels<br>
A set of samples was prepared to optimize the levels of menthyl lactate and<br>
fragrance in the formulation. The samples were prepared by making a pre-mix of<br>
Carbowax PEG-1450, Arlasolve 200, salicylic acid, vitamin E acetate, Cetiol HE,<br>
benzoic acid, Frescolat MR, ethanol, and fragrance; and a main batch of water,<br>
glycerine, Univul MS-40, sodium citrate, FD&amp;C blue #1 (0.1% solution), FD&amp;C<br>
yellow #10 (0.1% solution), Ritapan DL, and Actiphyte of Aloe Vera; then<br>
combining the main batch and the pre-mix. The following samples were prepared:<br><br><br>
Samples were stored at room temperature, 4°C, 40°C, and 50°C and checked<br>
for smell. Over time, no change in smell was detected for any sample, except at<br>
50°C, where all 4 samples had a slight alcohol odor. After three freeze/thaw cycles,<br>
no change in smell was detected for any sample, except for sample 33, where a<br>
slight alcohol odor was noticed after two and three cycles.<br>
Example 9 - The Effect Of Varying PEG and pH<br>
The following samples were prepared to compare the effect of different<br>
molecular weight PEGs. Sub-samples were pH adjusted to determine the effect of<br>
pH on the stability of the samples.<br><br><br><br>
Samples 35 and 36 were tested for accelerated aging. Sub-samples of<br>
samples 35 and 36 were pH adjusted using sodium citrate. Three samples were<br>
prepared for sample 35: one at pH 3.23, one at pH 3.62, and one at pH 3.91. Two<br>
samples were prepared for sample 36: one at pH 3.63 and one at pH 3.89. The pH<br>
adjusted samples were also tested for accelerated aging.<br>
After 5 weeks storage, sample 35 at pH 3.23 was slightly hazy at room<br>
temperature, but clear at 4°C, 40°C, and 50°C. Sample 35 at pH 3.62 was clear at<br>
room temperature, 4°C, 40°C, and 50°C. Sample 35 at pH 3.91 was clear at room<br>
temperature and at 50°C, but cloudy/opaque at 4°C and 40°C. The results of the<br>
freeze thaw studies were: at pH 3.23, crystals precipitated out after the 2nd cycle, at<br>
pH 3.63 the sample was clear after 3 cycles, and at pH 3.91, the sample was<br>
cloudy/opaque after each cycle.<br>
After 5 weeks storage, sample 36 at pH 3.63 was clear at room temperature,<br>
4°C, 40°C, and 50°C. Sample 36 at pH 3.89 was cloudy/opaque at room<br>
temperature, hazy at 40°C, and clear at 50°C. The freeze/thaw results were as<br>
follows: for pH 3.63, the sample was clear after 3 cycles, for pH 3.89, the sample<br>
was hazy after cycles 1 and 2, and cloudy/opaque after cycle 3.<br>
Both the molecular weight of the PEG and the pH of the sample had an effect<br>
on the physical stability of the formulation.<br><br>
