Intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements in a radio<br>
communication system<br>
The invention relates to a method for communicating by radio,<br>
in which a receiver receives a first signal at a first radio<br>
frequency and determines the received level of the signal.<br>
In radio communication systems, messages, for example<br>
comprising voice information, image information, video<br>
information, SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multimedia<br>
Messaging Service) or other data are transmitted via a radio<br>
interface between transmitting and receiving station with the<br>
aid of electromagnetic waves. Depending on the actual<br>
embodiment of the radio communication system, the stations can<br>
be different types of subscriber radio stations or radio<br>
stations in the network such as repeaters, radio access points<br>
or base stations. In a mobile radio communication system, at<br>
least some of the subscriber radio stations are mobile radio<br>
stations. The electromagnetic waves are radiated with carrier<br>
frequencies which are in the frequency band provided for the<br>
respective system.<br>
Mobile radio communication systems are frequently embodied as<br>
cellular systems, e.g. in accordance with the GSM (Global<br>
System for Mobile Communication) standard or UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System), with a network<br>
infrastructure consisting, e.g., of base stations, facilities<br>
for supervising and controlling the base stations and other<br>
facilities in the network. Apart from these cellular hierarchic<br>
radio networks organized over a wide area (supralocal) , there<br>
are also wireless local area networks (WLANs) with a radio<br>
coverage area which, as a rule, is much more limited in space.<br><br>
Examples of various standards for WLANs are HiperLAN, DECT,<br>
IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth and WATM.<br>
Many subscriber radio stations can communicate in different<br>
frequency ranges, if necessary by using different radio<br>
technologies. Before such a communication takes place, it is<br>
required, as a rule, that the radio station performs<br>
measurements on signals of the respective frequency range.<br>
However, it is frequently complex for a radio station currently<br>
communicating in a first frequency range to perform<br>
measurements in a second frequency range.<br>
The invention is based on the object of presenting an efficient<br>
method for communication by radio in which a receiver receives<br>
and measures a signal at a first radio frequency. Furthermore,<br>
a suitable radio station for carrying out the method is to be<br>
presented.<br>
This object is achieved by a method having the features of<br>
claim 1 and by a device having the features of subordinate<br>
claims. Advantageous embodiments and developments are the<br>
subject matter of subclaims.<br>
In the method for communicating by radio according to the<br>
invention, a receiver receives a first signal at a first radio<br>
frequency and determines the received level. Furthermore, the<br>
receiver receives at the first radio frequency information<br>
relating to a received level of the signal. According to the<br>
invention, the receiver, by using the received level determined<br>
and the information relating to the received level, decides<br>
about carrying out at least one measurement on a second signal<br>
radiated at a second radio frequency.<br>
The receiver is preferably a subscriber station. The receiver<br>
receives a signal and information<br><br>
relating to the received level of the signal at a first radio<br>
frequency. Depending on the actual embodiment of the radio<br>
communication system, the first radio frequency can be a narrow<br>
frequency band or a wide frequency band. It is advantageous if<br>
the receiver currently communicates at the first radio<br>
frequency, i.e., apart from the signal and the information<br>
relating to the received level of the signal, receives and<br>
evaluates further messages which are radiated at the first<br>
radio frequency and possibly also sends out messages at the<br>
first radio frequency. The first signal and the information<br>
relating to the received level of the first signal are<br>
preferably information items which are intended not only for<br>
the receiver considered but also for a multiplicity of<br>
receivers. It is possible that the information relating to the<br>
received level of the first signal is a component of the first<br>
signal or also a component of another message. The information<br>
relating to the received level of the first signal can relate,<br>
e.g., to the received level at a particular location or can be<br>
a measure of a received level averaged over a certain range.<br>
The receiver makes the decision whether it should carry out<br>
measurements on a second signal, the second signal being<br>
radiated at a second radio frequency. The second radio<br>
frequency, like the first radio frequency, can be a narrow or a<br>
wide frequency band depending on the actual embodiment of the<br>
radio communication system. The first and the second radio<br>
frequency differ from one another, if they are frequency bands<br>
or ranges, they preferably do not have any overlaps. To decide<br>
about carrying out measurements, the received level determined<br>
and the information relating to the received level of the first<br>
signal are utilized. This means that a decision about the<br>
procedure with respect to another radio frequency is made on<br>
the basis of messages received at the first radio frequency.<br><br>
It is advantageous, in particular, if an evaluation of messages<br>
of the second radio frequency is not necessary for this<br>
decision. Apart from the received level determined and the<br>
information relating to the received level of the first signal,<br>
the receiver can include further variables in the decision, if<br>
necessary.<br>
The at least one measurement about the carrying out of which<br>
the receiver decides is preferably one or more measurements<br>
which is or are used for preparing a change of radio frequency<br>
of the receiver from the first to the second radio frequency or<br>
which can be utilized for a decision about such a change.<br>
The level of the reception of the first signal depends on the<br>
current location of the receiver. It is advantageous,<br>
therefore, if the receiver does not move too far or fast<br>
between the time/the times of reception of the first signal and<br>
of the information relating to the received level of the first<br>
signal and the time of the decision about carrying out<br>
measurements.<br>
As a development of the invention, the receiver carries out at<br>
least one measurement on the second signal if the received<br>
level determined is greater than a value indicated by the<br>
information relating to the received level. A comparison of the<br>
two received levels corresponds to an estimation of the<br>
position of the receiver at which the received level of the<br>
first signal is determined relative to a position at which the<br>
first signal is received with the level indicated by the<br>
information. It is possible that the at least one measurement<br>
is also carried out when the two received levels are equal.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, the<br>
receiver does not perform a measurement on the second signal if<br>
the received<br><br>
level determined is less than a value indicated by the<br>
information relating to the received level. It is possible that<br>
no measurement is carried out even if the two received levels<br>
are equal.<br>
The information relating to	the received level is preferably<br>
radiated by the transmitter	of the first signal. The second<br>
signal can be radiated by	the same transmitter or another<br>
transmitter.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, the first<br>
signal is radiated inside a first radio coverage area and the<br>
second signal is radiated inside a second radio coverage area,<br>
wherein the two radio coverage areas overlap. That the two<br>
radio coverage areas overlap means that at least a part of the<br>
first radio coverage area is also a part of the second radio<br>
coverage area. It is thus possible, for example, that the first<br>
radio coverage area is a component of the second radio coverage<br>
area or conversely. The transmitters of the two signals can be<br>
the same or different ones.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
information relating to the received level comprises a measure<br>
of the received level of the first signal at the edge of the<br>
second radio coverage area. If the received level of the first<br>
signal is not of equal magnitude everywhere at the edge of the<br>
second radio coverage area, it is possible that the measure of<br>
the received level specifies the received level at a particular<br>
part of the edge or also the average value of the received<br>
level over the edge.<br>
It is possible that the second signal is radiated by using a<br>
different radio technology than the first signal. Thus, for<br>
example, a CDMA technology according to UMTS can be used for<br>
the first signal and an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplex) technology<br><br>
for the second signal. In this case, the receiver is preferably<br>
a multi-mode receiver which can communicate by means of<br>
different radio technologies successively or simultaneously.<br>
As a development of the invention, the receiver carries out at<br>
least one measurement on the second signal wherein the at least<br>
one measurement is then used for deciding about a change from<br>
the first to the second radio frequency. After this change, the<br>
receiver continues at the second radio frequency what it has<br>
carried out at the first radio frequency before the change. If,<br>
for example, it is sending signaling information at the first<br>
radio frequency before the change, it is sending this at the<br>
second radio frequency after the change. The decision about<br>
carrying out the change can be made in this case by the<br>
receiver or by another facility which requests the receiver to<br>
carry out the change.<br>
It is advantageous if the information relating to the received<br>
level directly indicates to another receiver that no<br>
measurements are to be carried out at the second signal. The<br>
other receiver thus evaluates the information relating to the<br>
received level as does the receiver. However, the other<br>
receiver, in contrast to the receiver, can see directly from<br>
the information that it does not have to carry out any<br>
measurements on the second signal whilst the receiver, in<br>
contrast, needs at least the received level of the first signal<br>
determined by it for the decision about carrying out<br>
measurements.<br>
As a development of the invention, the information relating to<br>
the received level is first determined with the cooperation of<br>
radio stations which carry out measurements on messages<br>
radiated at the first and at the second radio frequency. By<br>
means of these measurements, it is possible, e.g., to determine<br>
correlations between the received level of messages of the<br>
first<br><br>
radio frequency in comparison with messages of the second radio<br>
frequency at particular locations.<br>
The radio station according to the invention for a radio<br>
communication system has means for receiving a first signal at<br>
a first radio frequency, means for determining the received<br>
level of the first signal, means for receiving information at<br>
the first radio frequency relating to a received level of the<br>
first signal, and means for deciding about the performance of<br>
measurements on a second signal radiated at a second radio<br>
frequency.<br>
The radio station according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for carrying out the method according to the<br>
invention, wherein this can also apply to the embodiments and<br>
developments. It can have further suitable means for this<br>
purpose.<br>
In the text which follows, the invention will be explained in<br>
greater detail with reference to an exemplary embodiment, in<br>
which:<br>
figure 1 shows a first section from a radio communication<br>
system,<br>
figure 2 shows the structure of a signaling message,<br>
figure 3 shows a second section from a radio communication<br>
system.<br>
The section from a radio communication system, shown in<br>
figure 1, comprises the base station BS and the subscriber<br>
station MS; further components of the radio communication<br>
system are not shown for the sake of clarity. The radio<br>
communication system considered is a system according to the<br>
UMTS standard in accordance with the FDD mode of operation. The<br><br>
base station BS communicates with the subscriber stations in at<br>
least two different frequency ranges, there being differently<br>
large radio coverage areas for the two different<br><br>
frequency ranges. There is the radio cell FZ_F2 within which<br>
the base station BS can communicate with subscriber stations in<br>
the frequency range F2, and the radio cell FZ_F1 within which<br>
the base station BS can communicate with subscriber stations in<br>
the frequency range Fl.<br>
The radio cells FZ_F2 and FZ_F1 are shown as circles in<br>
figure 1, which is a simplification which, as a rule, does not<br>
correspond to the form of radio cells in reality. Independently<br>
of its actual shape and size, a radio cell is understood in the<br>
text which follows to be a geographic area in which the<br>
communication between subscriber stations and a base station is<br>
possible in a certain frequency range and/or by using a certain<br>
radio technology. The situation is considered that two radio<br>
cells of different frequencies are present, one of the two<br>
radio cells being a component of the other one.<br>
For UTRA FDD, the frequency ranges, called "core bands", of<br>
1920-1980 MHz were defined for the upward direction, and of<br>
2110-2170 MHz for the downward direction. To be able to take<br>
into consideration asymmetric radio traffic, the frequency<br>
range of 2500-2690 MHz is also available which can be used as<br>
"extension band" by UTRA FDD. The extension band can be used<br>
for the upward direction and the downward direction and also<br>
just for the downward direction. The frequency range Fl of<br>
figure 1 can be, e.g., an unpaired part of the extension band<br>
used for the FDD downward direction.<br>
In the text which follows, it is assumed that the subscriber<br>
station MS communicates with the base station BS in one of the<br>
two frequency ranges Fl or F2. For various purposes, e.g. cell<br>
selection/reselection or handover preparation, it is necessary<br>
that the subscriber station MS performs measurements<br><br>
on signals of the other frequency ranges, i.e. inter-frequency<br>
measurements, sent out by the base station. Cell selection is<br>
understood to be the selection of a radio cell by a subscriber<br>
station for camping which is relevant for the "idle mode" or<br>
also for the "connected mode" in the case of "out of service".<br>
Cell reselection is understood to be the reselection of such a<br>
selection already made. Since the radio frequency currently<br>
used and the radio frequency at which the measurements are to<br>
be performed differ from one another, the compressed mode is<br>
usually used in order to enable the measurements to be<br>
performed. In this context, messages are sent out at an<br>
increased data rate at the frequency currently used for<br>
communication so that the required measurements can be carried<br>
out at the other radio frequency in the time saved by this<br>
means. However, this leads to increased interference.<br>
Subscriber stations which can communicate simultaneously in the<br>
two different frequency ranges (dual- or multi-mode devices) do<br>
not require the compressed mode but the measurements must be<br>
carried out simultaneously at the two different frequencies. In<br>
both cases, carrying out inter-frequency measurements results<br>
in increased battery consumption for the respective subscriber<br>
station.<br>
Since the sizes of the radio cells FZ_F2 and FZ_F1 differ from<br>
one another, situations occur in which inter-frequency<br>
measurements do not need to be carried out. This applies, e.g.<br>
to a subscriber station, currently communicating in radio<br>
frequency range F2 which is located at location 01 of figure 1.<br>
Since its location 01 is outside the radio cell FZ Fl, there is<br>
no adequate reception of signals of the radio frequency range<br>
F1. The attempt of performing measurements in the radio<br>
frequency range Fl, nevertheless, would thus be in vain. Since<br>
both the carrying out of inter-frequency measurements and the<br>
attempt of carrying out these measurements is associated with<br>
the disadvantages explained<br><br>
above, such vain attempts should be avoided.<br>
In the text which follows, a method is described by means of<br>
which a subscriber station can decide whether it is meaningful<br>
to carry out inter-frequency measurements. For this purpose,<br>
the subscriber station measures the received level of the CPICH<br>
(common pilot channel) of the frequency range currently used by<br>
it at its current site. In the text which follows, the<br>
frequency range currently used by it is understood to be the<br>
frequency range in which the subscriber station evaluates<br>
signals from a base station and, if necessary, also sends<br>
signals to a base station. The CPICH is a channel radiated by<br>
broadcasting by the base station, which contains a fixed bit<br>
pattern for supporting the channel estimation of subscriber<br>
stations. In the text which follows, the received level of the<br>
CPICH in the frequency range F2 at the current site of a<br>
subscriber station is called F2_CPICH_RSCP, and Fl_CPICH_RSCP<br>
in the frequency range Fl.<br>
From the CPICH or another signaling channel of the frequency<br>
range currently used by it for communication, the subscriber<br>
station takes a quantity, called F2_CPICH@FZ_Fl_BOUNDARY in the<br>
text which follows, when the subscriber station currently<br>
communicates in the frequency range F2, or a quantity called<br>
F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY if the subscriber station currently<br>
communicates in the frequency range Fl. In this context, the<br>
quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY is a measure of the received<br>
level of the CPICH of frequency range F2 at the edge of the<br>
radio cell FZ_F1, and the quantity F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY is a<br>
measure of the received level of the CPICH of the frequency<br>
range Fl at the edge of the radio cell FZ_F2.<br>
The subscriber station compares its F2_CPICH_RSCP measurement<br>
with the quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY, or its F1_CPICH_RSCP<br>
measurement with the quantity Fl_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY in order<br>
to<br><br>
decide whether it is meaningful to carry out an inter-frequency<br>
measurement. If the F2_CPICH_RSCP measurement value exceeds the<br>
quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY, an inter-frequency<br>
measurement in the frequency range Fl is meaningful, if the<br>
F2_CPICH_RSCP measurement value is below the quantity<br>
F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY, the inter-frequency measurement in the<br>
frequency range Fl should be dispensed with. This<br>
correspondingly applies to the comparison of the F1_CPICH_RSCP<br>
measurement value with the quantity F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY.<br>
If a subscriber station is located, for example, at location 01<br>
and currently communicates in the frequency range F2, it finds<br>
that its F2_CPICH_RSCP measurement value is smaller than the<br>
quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY. This means that the<br>
subscriber station is more distant from the base station BS<br>
than the edge of the radio cell FZ_F1, i.e. that the subscriber<br>
station is located outside the radio cell FZ_F1. An inter-<br>
frequency measurement in the frequency range Fl is not<br>
meaningful, therefore. If, in contrast, the subscriber station<br>
is located at location 02, it finds that its F2_CPICH_RSCP<br>
measurement value is greater than the quantity<br>
F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY. This means that the subscriber station<br>
is closer to the base station BS than the edge of the radio<br>
cell FZ_F1, i.e. that the subscriber station is located inside<br>
the radio cell FZ_F1. An inter-frequency measurement can<br>
therefore be carried out in the frequency range F1.<br>
If, in contrast, the subscriber station is located at location<br>
02 and currently communicates in frequency range Fl, it finds<br>
that its F1_CPICH_RSCP measurement value is greater than the<br>
quantity F1__CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY. For the given case where the<br>
radio cell FZ_Z1 is a part of radio cell FZ_Z2, the quantity<br>
Fl_CPICH@FZ_F2_B0UNDARY has the value of zero. This means that<br>
the subscriber station is closer to the base station BS than<br>
the edge of the radio cell FZ_F2, i.e. that the subscriber<br>
station is inside the radio cell FZ_F2.<br><br>
An inter-frequency measurement can be carried out, therefore,<br>
in the frequency range F2 . This obviously applies to any site<br>
inside the radio cell FZ_F1.<br>
To influence the sites at which subscriber stations carry out<br>
inter-frequency measurements or at what vicinity to the radio<br>
cell of the other frequency in each case such inter-frequency<br>
measurements are carried out, such threshold values<br>
THRESHOLD@FZ_F1 or THRESHOLD@FZ_F2 can be used by which the<br>
quantities F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY and F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY<br>
are changed. Using the threshold values makes it possible to<br>
carry out load balancing between the communications in<br>
frequency range Fl and F2 . If, e.g., handovers are to be<br>
carried out increasingly from frequency range F2 into frequency<br>
range Fl, a large value can be selected for THRESHOLD@FZ_F1<br>
which must be subtracted from the F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY value<br>
so that many subscriber stations carry out inter-frequency<br>
measurements in the frequency range F1. Using these threshold<br>
values, the following conditions are then obtained:<br>
For subscriber stations which currently communicate in<br>
frequency range F2:<br>
(1.1)<br>
If<br>
F2_CPICH_RSCP &gt; F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY -  THRESHOLD@FZ_F1<br>
applies, an inter-frequency measurement in frequency range Fl<br>
is possible or necessary.<br>
(1.2)<br>
If<br>
F2_CPICH_RSCP 
applies, an inter-frequency measurement in frequency range Fl<br>
is not necessary.<br><br><br>
For subscriber stations which currently communicate in<br>
frequency range F1:<br>
(2.1)<br>
If<br>
F1_CPICH_RSCP &gt; F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY -  THRESHOLD@FZ_F2<br>
applies, an inter-frequency measurement in frequency range F2<br>
is possible or necessary.<br>
(2.2)<br>
If<br>
F1_CPICH_RSCP 
applies, an inter-frequency measurement in frequency range F2<br>
is not necessary.<br>
This does not assume any knowledge of the subscriber station<br>
about which of the two radio cells FZ_F1 or FZ_F2 is the larger<br>
one.<br>
The procedure described has the advantage that initially only<br>
intra-frequency measurements need to be carried out. These do<br>
not need the compressed mode so that initially these<br>
measurements do not cause any increase in interference. An<br>
inter-frequency measurement is carried out only when it is<br>
meaningful, namely when the subscriber station is located<br>
inside the respective other radio cell and the other radio cell<br>
is thus a potential candidate for a cell selection/reselection<br>
or a handover, respectively.<br>
Figure 2 shows the structure of a signaling message SIG by<br>
means of which a subscriber station is informed about the<br>
quantities needed by it for deciding about carrying out an<br>
inter-frequency measurement. The signaling message SIG is<br>
radiated in the frequency range in which the subscriber station<br>
currently communicates, preferably<br><br>
in the BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel). The SIG message<br>
contains the following information:<br>
F: the radio frequency range to which the inter-frequency<br>
measurement is related;<br>
optionally the quantity RAT: specifying the radio technology<br>
used in the radio frequency range F;<br>
THRESHOLD: the threshold value, explained above, of formulae<br>
(1.1), (1.2), (2.1) and (2.2);<br>
CPICH@BOUNDARY: the received level of the CPICH of the<br>
frequency range of radiation of the SIG message at the edge of<br>
the radio cell of the radio frequency range F;<br>
optionally the quantity T: indicates a time during which the<br>
quantities F, RAT, THRESHOLD and CPICH@BOUNDARY are valid.<br>
Specification of the radio technology RAT can be dispensed with<br>
if the radio technology of the frequency range F and the radio<br>
technology of the frequency range of the SIG message is the<br>
same radio technology. Specifying the radio technology RAT<br>
supports handover between various types of radio communication<br>
systems such as, e.g. betwaen a UMTS and a WiMAX system.<br>
It is possible to depart from the order of the quantities F,<br>
RAT, THRESHOLD, CPICH@BOUNDARY and T, shown in figure 2.<br>
Furthermore, the SIG message can comprise other quantities, not<br>
shown in figure 2, such as, e.g. information relating to its<br>
own radio cell. The quantities F, RAT, THRESHOLD,<br>
CPICH@BOUNDARY and T can be sent out for a plurality of<br>
frequency ranges. In this case, the SIG message can comprise a<br>
number of records of these quantities, as an alternative, a<br>
separate SIG message can be used for each record.<br>
If cell selection/reselection or handover to another radio cell<br>
are to be restricted, sending out the SIG signal with respect<br>
to the frequency range of this radio cell can be dispensed<br>
with. If the subscriber stations<br><br>
are allowed to perform inter-frequency measurements only if the<br>
comparison explained by means of formulae (1.1), (1.2), (2.1)<br>
and (2.2) has been carried out, the subscriber stations cannot<br>
carry out inter-frequency measurements in frequency ranges with<br>
respect to which they have not received an SIG signal.<br>
Beyond its purpose explained hitherto, the quantity THRESHOLD<br>
can be used for signaling special situations:<br>
If, for example, the radio cell FZ_F1 would not exist in<br>
figure 1 or not available temporarily, it is possible<br>
that, nevertheless, the quantities F, RAT, THRESHOLD,<br>
CPICH@BOUNDARY and T relating to the frequency range Fl<br>
are radiated in the signaling of the frequency range F2, a<br>
special value being set for the quantity THRESHOLD which<br>
indicates that the radio cell FZ_F1 is not available.<br>
It may be meaningful, particularly for subscriber stations<br>
which have come into radio cell FZ F2 through a handover<br>
from outside the radio cell FZ_F2, to provide information<br>
that the radio cell FZ_F1 is smaller than radio cell<br>
FZ_F2. This can be implemented, e.g. by establishing the<br>
quantity of THRESHOLD@FZ_F2 at a special value which<br>
indicates that the radio cell FZ_F2 comprises radio cell<br>
FZ_F1. If a subscriber station comes from a neighboring<br>
radio cell in which it has communicated in the frequency<br>
range F2, it can recognize briefly after the handover into<br>
radio cell FZ_F2, i.e. when it is at the edge of the radio<br>
cell FZ_F2, by means of the special value of the quantity<br>
of THRESHOLD@FZ_F2 that an inter-frequency measurement at<br>
radio frequency Fl is not necessary so that it initially<br>
only carries out intra-frequency measurements at radio<br>
frequency F2 . A subscriber station of a neighboring radio<br>
cell which communicates there<br><br>
in frequency range Fl recognizes from the special value of<br>
the quantity of THRESHOLD@FZ_F2 that inter-frequency<br>
measurements have to be carried out at radio frequency F2.<br>
The formulae (2.1) and (2.2) explained above are still<br>
applicable for other subscriber stations, wherein the<br>
special value can be treated in such a manner as if it is<br>
zero, e.g. the special value of the quantity of<br>
THRESHOLD@FZ_F2 can be a negative value which is<br>
interpreted as zero by the subscriber stations for<br>
applications in the formulae (2.1) and (2.2) .<br>
In UTRA FDD, the size of a radio cell is established by the<br>
area within which subscriber stations can receive and evaluate<br>
the CPICH of the respective base station with sufficient<br>
quality. This extent is not constant, the cells can "breathe".<br>
If the level at which a base station is sending out its CPICH<br>
is changed, the respective quantity of CPICH@BOUNDARY must be<br>
adapted. The quantity of CPICH@BOUNDARY can be established as<br>
part of the radio network planning. The quantity of<br>
CPICH@BOUNDARY can also be determined, e.g. as described in the<br>
text which follows. This assumes that the quantity<br>
F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY is to be redetermined, e.g. because the<br>
transmitted power of the CPICH of radio cell FZ_F2 has been<br>
changed.<br>
1) In the network, the value of the received level of the<br>
CPICH of the radio cell FZ_F1 at the edge of radio cell<br>
FZ_F1 is established. The subscriber stations are informed<br>
that they should measure the received level of the CPICH<br>
of frequency F2 when they find that their current received<br>
level for the CPICH of frequency Fl corresponds to the<br>
established value. In this context, it is possible that<br>
not all subscriber stations are requested to carry out the<br>
measurements which are used for determining the quantity<br>
F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY. The subscriber stations obliged<br><br>
to carry out the measurements can be selected, e.g., by<br>
each<br><br>
subscriber station being sent a random number in connected<br>
mode, these subscriber stations generating their own<br>
random number and comparing it with the received random<br>
number. Depending on whether its own random number is<br>
greater than or smaller than the received one, a<br>
subscriber station must carry out the measurements or not.<br>
During the selection of the subscriber station for<br>
measurement purposes, subscriber stations can also be<br>
preferably selected which do not need a compressed mode<br>
for carrying out the inter-frequency measurements and/or<br>
the battery power of which is less restricted.<br>
2)	The subscriber stations measure the received level of the<br>
CPICH both of radio cell FZ_F1 and of radio cell FZ_F2. If<br>
the received level of the CPICH of radio cell FZ_F1<br>
corresponds to the value established in step 1), the value<br>
of the received level of the CPICH of radio cell FZ_F2 is<br>
measured and reported to the base station.<br>
3)	In the network, the measurement results conveyed by the<br>
subscriber stations are collected and from these the<br>
quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY is determined. If the<br>
radio cell FZ_F2 is not an approximately circular radio<br>
cell, it is advantageous to carry out averaging or<br>
weighting of the measurement results. The value of the<br>
quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY calculated in the network<br>
is then sent out to the subscriber stations by means of<br>
the SIG signal as described above.<br>
If the quantity F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY is carried out for a<br>
number of transmitted powers of the CPICH of frequency range<br>
F2, it is possible to interpolate the quantity<br>
F2_CPICH@FZ_F1_BOUNDARY to other values of the transmitted<br>
powers of the CPICH of the frequency range F2.<br><br>
Such a determination of the quantity F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY is<br>
not necessary with respect to radio cell FZ_F1 since, according<br>
to figure 1, radio cell FZ_F1 is a component of the radio cell<br>
FZ_F2 so that the quantity F1_CPICH@FZ_F2_BOUNDARY is<br>
mandatorily set to zero.<br>
Whereas figure 1 shows the case that base station BS supplies<br>
both radio cell FZ_F1 and radio cell FZ_F2, is also possible,<br>
as an alternative, that these are supplied by different base<br>
stations. Furthermore, the invention can also be applied to the<br>
case where the radio cell FZ_F1 is not a component of the radio<br>
cell FZ_F2 but that radio cells FZ_F1 and FZ_F2 are only<br>
overlapping radio cells as shown, for example, in figure 3.<br>
According to figure 3, a first base station BS1 supplies radio<br>
cell FZ_F1 and a second base station BS2, adjacent to the first<br>
base station, supplies radio cell FZ_F2, the two radio cells<br>
FZ_F1 and FZ_F2 having an area of overlap L at the edge. The<br>
invention allows a subscriber station located inside the area<br>
of overlap L to determine that it can carry out inter-frequency<br>
measurements, and a subscriber station located in the remaining<br>
part of radio cell FZ_F1 or FZ_F2 to determine that no inter-<br>
frequency measurements can be carried out. Correspondingly, the<br>
invention can also be applied to a constellation according to<br>
which the two radio cells considered are overlapping sectors of<br>
a base station using certain antenna patterns, different<br>
frequency ranges being used for the different sectors.<br>
In these cases, a more complex calculation than explained by<br>
means of formulae (1.1), (1.2), (2.1) and (2.2) is necessary in<br>
order to be able to decide whether inter-frequency measurements<br>
are to be carried out. This can include the following<br>
quantities:<br><br>
•	The change in received level of the CPICH of the frequency<br>
range currently used for communication due to a movement<br>
of a subscriber station, i.e. a differentiation of this<br>
received level.<br>
•	Received levels of CPICHs of adjacent radio cells in the<br>
frequency range currently used for communication.<br><br>
