				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless communication system comprising at least one<br>
base station in a communication cell, the base station being equipped with at least one array<br>
antenna comprising at least two antenna ports, where the at least two ports are connected to<br>
respective at least two corresponding antenna elements, where at least two of the at least two<br>
antenna elements, have essentially the same polarization.<br>
According to a certain aspect of the invention, in a first mode of operation, the array antenna<br>
is arranged for communication via one antenna radiation lobe, communicating one<br>
information stream to at least one UE (user equipment) in the cell.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for communication of at least one information<br>
stream from a base station array antenna in a communication cell, the base station array<br>
antenna comprising at least two antenna ports, where the at least two ports are connected to<br>
respective at least two corresponding antenna elements, where at least two of the at least two<br>
antenna elements have essentially the same polarization.<br>
According to a certain aspect of the invention, in a first mode of operation, the method<br>
comprises the step: communicating one information stream, to at least one UE (user<br>
equipment) in the cell, via one antenna radiation lobe.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The demand for wireless communication systems has grown steadily, and is still growing, and<br>
a number of technological advancement steps have been taken during this growth. In order to<br>
acquire increased system capacity and user data bit rate for wireless systems by employing<br>
de-correlated propagation paths, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems have been<br>
considered to constitute a preferred technology for improving the capacity and the user data<br>
bit rate. MIMO employs a number of separate independent signal paths, for example by<br>
means of several transmitting and receiving antennas.<br><br>
Generally, a MIMO system utilizes de-correlated, or at least essentially de-correlated,<br>
transmitted signals. The meaning of the term "de-correlated signals" in this context is that the<br>
radiation patterns are essentially de-correlated. This is today made possible by means of<br>
spatial separation, i.e. having at least two antennas separated by 5-10 wavelengths, (calculated<br>
from the centre frequency of the frequency band for which the antennas are designed),<br>
normally in azimuth, in order to achieve low correlation between the signals at the antenna<br>
ports. These at least two antennas have at least one antenna radiation lobe each.<br>
It is also possible to combine spatial separation with polarization separation, where the<br>
antennas then also are arranged for transmission and reception of signals having orthogonal<br>
polarizations.<br>
A base station in a MIMO system may thus be arranged with a number of antennas, separated<br>
by 5-10 wavelengths, each one of the base station antennas either being designed for one<br>
polarization or a plurality of essentially de-correlated polarizations, typically two essentially<br>
de-correlated polarizations. These antennas produce antenna radiation lobes which are de-<br>
correlated, either by space or polarization, or both.<br>
It is necessary that a user equipment (for example a mobile phone or a portable computer) is<br>
arranged with at least two antenna ports for communication in a MIMO system.<br>
A problem with existing MIMO arrangements is that, since an original information stream is<br>
divided into two or more separate information streams, the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) is<br>
deteriorated given a fixed output power. A decreased SNR results in that the rate of<br>
transferred data, the data bit rate, is decreased.<br>
Furthermore, the signal path between the base station and the user equipment may be blocked<br>
by a number of objects such as large buildings in an urban environment, which objects cause a<br>
number of reflections. These reflections may result in that the signal to noise ratio (SNR)<br>
becomes even more deteriorated, and thus the signals transmitted between the base station and<br>
the user equipment may become more and more noisy the more buildings that are in the way.<br><br>
It may thus be possible to use MIMO only in the vicinity of a base station. A good MIMO<br>
performance requires good SNR.<br>
The traditional MIMO systems, having one information stream per antenna, are thus afflicted<br>
with a disadvantage concerning the data bit rate between the base station and the user<br>
equipment, both in urban environments and in the countryside, due to the fact that the base<br>
station antenna radiation lobes are spatially separated in order to obtain essentially de-<br>
correlated signals. This means that the MIMO system is not used optimally, for a given<br>
surface area and output power.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective problem that is solved by the present invention is to provide an arrangement<br>
suitable for a MIMO system, which arrangement is capable of providing an enhanced<br>
communication between a base station, having at least two antenna ports, and a user<br>
equipment, having at least two antenna ports for communication via the at least two base<br>
station antenna radiation lobes.<br>
The objective problem is solved by means of a wireless communication system according to<br>
the introduction, where the array antenna is arranged for communication via at least two<br>
antenna radiation lobes, each antenna radiation lobe communicating an information stream to<br>
the at least one UE (user equipment) in the cell, thus communicating by means of MIMO<br>
(Multiple Input Multiple Output).<br>
According to a certain aspect of the invention, this corresponds to a second mode of<br>
operation.<br>
The objective problem is also solved by means of an array antenna arranged for use in the<br>
communication system.<br>
Furthermore, the objective problem is also solved by means of a method according to the<br>
introduction, where the method further comprises the step: communicating at least two<br><br>
information streams, to the at least one UE (user equipment) in the cell, via at least two<br>
antenna radiation lobes.<br>
According to a certain aspect of the invention, this corresponds to a second mode of<br>
operation.<br>
That means that the decrease of SNR due to the dividing of an original information stream<br>
into two or more separate information streams is more or less recovered by use of array gain,<br>
where furthermore a relatively small amount of information regarding the channel is required.<br>
Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>
Several advantages are achieved by means of the present invention, for example:<br>
-	higher bit rate capacity<br>
-	easy installation and lower site costs<br>
-	a single antenna with multiple antenna radiation lobes, pointing in different directions<br>
and being sufficiently de-correlated, is used instead of multiple antennas with single<br>
antenna radiation lobes, resulting in that the antenna surface is used efficiently, taking<br>
advantage of the antenna array gain, the whole antenna surface providing gain for each<br>
radiation lobe.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Figure 1a, a communication system C comprises a base station 1 arranged for<br>
communication in a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) system. The base station 1 is<br>
placed in such a way that it covers a communication cell 2. With reference also to Figure lb,<br>
the base station 1 is equipped with an array antenna 3, which array antenna 3 in a first<br>
embodiment comprises a first 4, second 5, third 6 and fourth 7 antenna element. Each antenna<br>
element 4, 5. 6, 7 comprises at least one radiating element. The antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7 are<br>
placed in a first 8 and second 9 row and a first 10 and second column 11, forming a 2x2 array<br>
antenna 3. The antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7 are preferably mutually separated by approximately<br>
0.5-1 wavelengths (calculated from the centre frequency of the frequency band for which the<br>
antennas are designed) in a horizontal plane for beam-forming in azimuth and approximately<br>
0.5-4 wavelengths in a vertical plane for beam-forming in elevation. In this example, each<br>
antenna element 4, 5, 6, 7 is arranged for a single polarization, said polarization being<br>
essentially the same for each antenna element 4, 5, 6, 7. These antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7<br>
receive and transmit signals using the same frequency band, for the uplink and another<br>
frequency band for the downlink if FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) is utilized, or using the<br>
same frequency band, for both the uplink and the downlink if TDD (Time Division Duplex) is<br>
utilized.<br><br>
In this first embodiment, the four antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7 are each one connected to<br>
respective first 12, second 13, third 14 and fourth 15 feeding lines via a first PI, second P2,<br>
third P3 and fourth P4 respective antenna port, where the feeding lines 12, 13, 14, 15 are<br>
connected to a beam-forming device 16 of a previously known kind, for example a digital<br>
beam-forming device. The beam-forming device 16 is in turn connected to a first 17, second<br>
18, third 19 and fourth 20 information stream feeding line, each information stream<br>
originating from a total information stream feeding line 21. The total information stream is<br>
divided into the four information streams by means of a dividing device 22.<br>
One user equipment (UE) 23 is positioned within the cell 2, where the user equipment 23 for<br>
example is a mobile phone or a portable computer. It is assumed that the UE 23 is arranged<br>
for reception of four de-correlated signals, in other words it is assumed that the UE 23 is<br>
equipped with four independent antenna ports (not shown).<br>
According to the present invention, the radiation lobes 24, 25, 26, 27 are controlled depending<br>
on the transmission circumstances for transmission between the base station 1 and the UE 23.<br>
The control is performed in such a way that an enhanced communication between the base<br>
station 1 and the UE 23 is obtained.<br>
In the present embodiment, the beam-forming device 16 is arranged for controlling the<br>
number of output radiation lobes in such a way that one 24, two 25, three 26 or four 27<br>
radiation lobes with fixed predetermined directions in azimuth and elevation are switched on.<br>
The number of radiation lobes and which ones that should be turned on and off is controlled<br>
in such a way that an enhanced communication between the base station 1 and the UE 23 is<br>
obtained.<br>
In a first mode of operation, communication is performed via only one radiation lobe,<br>
communicating one information stream. Then the communication system C is not<br>
communicating via MIMO. In a second mode of operation, communication is performed via<br>
at least two antenna radiation lobes 24, 25, 26, 27, each antenna radiation lobe 24, 25, 26, 27<br>
communicating an information stream. Then the communication system C is communicating<br>
via MIMO.<br><br>
Independently on how many radiation lobes that are used, all the information from the total<br>
information stream is always radiated by the four antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7, utilizing the full<br>
area of the antenna element's aperture.<br>
The UE 23, which may be moving relative to the base station 1, continuously provides feed-<br>
back to the base station 1 regarding the highest data bit rate that is currently possible. Based<br>
on this information, the antenna radiation lobes 24, 25, 26, 27 are adaptively controlled. The<br>
adaptive control comprises turning radiation lobes on and off as well as distributing different<br>
power levels and/or data bit rates in each information stream.<br>
The feed-back normally comprises relatively limited information regarding the channel, in its<br>
simplest form the feed-back is only in the form of one data bit. The more information<br>
regarding the channel that is comprised in the feed-back, the better the adaptive control<br>
becomes. It is, however, possible to achieve an acceptable adaptive control with said<br>
relatively limited information regarding the channel. A typical type of feed-back is a so-called<br>
CQI-value (Channel Quality Indicator) that is well known in the art.<br>
In a second embodiment, which also may be implemented with reference to Figure la and lb,<br>
the four information streams are fed to the beam-forming device 16 which here is arranged<br>
for controlling the azimuth and elevation direction for each output antenna radiation lobe 24,<br>
25, 26. 27. The beam-forming device is in this example preferably a digital beam-forming<br>
device.<br>
Each one of the four information streams correspond to four base station antenna radiation<br>
lobes, where each one of the lobes is directed in the direction where the optimal<br>
communication with a certain UE is achieved. The adjustment of the lobes is performed both<br>
in azimuth and elevation. Directing lobes in this way may affect the signal paths in such a<br>
way that they are not essentially de-correlated, but according to the invention they are de-<br>
correlated to a sufficient degree.<br><br>
As in the first embodiment, the UE 23, which may be moving relative to the base station 1,<br>
continuously provides feed-back to the base station 1 regarding the highest transmission data<br>
bit rate that currently is possible. Based on this information, the directions of the antenna<br>
radiation lobes 24, 25, 26, 27 are adaptively controlled.<br>
The main goal of the invention is thus to enhance the communication, even if it means that the<br>
degree of de-correlation is decreased. De-correlation is then not preserved at the expense of<br>
communication data bit rate for all the embodiments.<br>
According to the embodiments above, during transmission, the digital beam-forming device<br>
16 feeds each one of the four information streams to each one of the antenna ports PI, P2, P3,<br>
P4 in the base station array antenna 3 with a certain amplitude relation and a certain phase<br>
relation in order to obtain the desired antenna radiation lobe directions in azimuth and<br>
elevation for each antenna radiation lobe 24, 25, 26, 27.<br>
That means that, in the examples, the first information stream is fed to all four antenna ports<br>
P1, P2, P3, P4, having a certain amplitude relation and a certain phase relation for each one of<br>
the antenna ports P1, P2, P3, P4. This may be performed for all information streams at the<br>
same time, and due to superposition, four antenna radiation lobes 24, 25, 26, 27 are obtained,<br>
one for each information stream, where each antenna radiation lobe 24, 25, 26, 27 is obtained<br>
by means of the four antenna elements 4, 5, 6, 7.<br>
In the first embodiment, no functionality for changing the direction of the antenna radiation<br>
lobes 24, 25, 26, 27 is provided, there is only the possibility to turn the antenna radiation lobes<br>
24, 25, 26, 27, thus pointing in pre-determined directions, on and off.<br>
The digital beam-forming described above is in itself previously known, and will not be<br>
described more in detail here.<br>
As shown in the side view in Figure 2, showing an example of the functionality of the second<br>
embodiment, a relatively small building 28 is positioned in front of a UE 23 and a large<br>
building is positioned behind the UE 23. Three antenna radiation lobes 24', 25', 26' are<br><br>
directed at the UE 23, having essentially the same directional angle in azimuth, but having<br>
different directional angles in elevation.<br>
An azimuth directional angle of an antenna radiation lobe is defined as the angle between a<br>
normal extending from the centre of the antenna's main radiating surface and the azimuth<br>
direction of the antenna radiation lobe. A corresponding definition is valid for an elevation<br>
directional angle of an antenna radiation lobe. The direction of an antenna radiation lobe is<br>
preferably defined as the direction where the antenna radiation lobe has its maximum signal,<br>
other definitions occur.<br>
Due to the smaller building 28 partly blocking the path, all four antenna radiation lobes 24',<br>
25', 26', 27' can not achieve an optimal communication with the UE 23 by being directed<br>
more or less directly at the UE 23. Therefore, one of the antenna radiation lobes 27', the<br>
fourth antenna radiation lobe in this example, is instead directed towards the larger building<br>
29 in such a way that the fourth information stream, which is transmitted by means of the<br>
fourth antenna radiation lobe 27', reaches the UE 23 by means of reflection in the larger<br>
building 29.<br>
If, for example, the UE 23 clears the smaller building 28, the fourth lobe 27' is re-directed in<br>
such a way that it is directed at the UE more directly based on the feed-back from the UE 23.<br>
Then, all four antenna radiation lobes 24', 25', 26', 27' are directed at the UE 23, having<br>
essentially the same directional angle in azimuth, but having different directional angles in<br>
elevation in order to provide sufficiently de-correlated propagation paths.<br>
As shown in the top view in Figure 3, showing another example of the functionality of the<br>
second embodiment, a relatively small building 30 is positioned in front of a UE 23, but there<br>
are no significant buildings behind the UE 23. A relatively large building 31 is positioned on<br>
the left side of the UE 23, when looking at the UE 23 from the base station 1.<br>
Three antenna radiation lobes 24", 25", 26" are directed at the UE 23, having essentially the<br>
same directional angle in azimuth, but having different directional angles in elevation (not<br>
shown in Figure 3 since it is a top view). Due to the smaller building 30 partly blocking the<br><br>
path, all four antenna radiation lobes 24", 25", 26", 27" can not achieve an optimal<br>
communication with the UE 23 by being directed directly at the UE 23. Therefore, one of the<br>
antenna radiation lobes 27", the fourth antenna radiation lobe in this example, is instead<br>
directed towards the larger building 31 at the left in such a way that the fourth information<br>
stream, which is transmitted by means of the fourth antenna radiation lobe 27", reaches the<br>
UE 23 by means of reflection in the larger building 31 at the left, regarded from the base<br>
station 1 point of view.<br>
In the same way as described previously, the lobe directions may be altered due to movement<br>
of the UE 23 or other circumstances. This is controlled based on the UE:s feed-back.<br>
As shown in the side view in Figure 4, showing yet another example of the functionality of<br>
the second embodiment, a UE 23 is positioned in the countryside, where there are no<br>
buildings. Here, all the antenna radiation lobes 24"', 25"', 26'", 27'" are directed at the UE<br>
23, having essentially the same directional angle in azimuth, but having different directional<br>
angles in elevation. The fourth embodiment illustrates that the present invention is not<br>
directed primarily towards reflections in buildings, but towards optimizing of the<br>
communication between the base station 1 and the UE 23, irrespective of the surroundings,<br>
and irrespective of if the degree of de-correlation is decreased.<br>
Of course, there are often more than one UE in the cell. With reference to Figure 5, there are a<br>
first 23a, second 23b and third 23c UE in a cell 2. According to the invention, each one of the<br>
UE:s 23a, 23b, 23c in the cell 2 receives a certain time slot where all the base station antenna<br>
radiation lobes (not shown in Figure 5) co-operate to optimize the communication between<br>
the base station 1 and a certain UE. During a first time slot, all the base station antenna<br>
radiation lobes co-operate to optimize the communication between the base station 1 and the<br>
first UE 23a. During a second and third time slot, communication is optimized between the<br>
base station 1 and the second 23b and third 23c UE:s, respectively, in the same way. How the<br>
antenna radiation lobes are directed for each UE 23a, 23b, 23c depends on the surroundings<br>
for each UE 23a, 23b, 23c, for example if there are buildings (not shown) present. The<br>
procedure according to the above relates to a time division multiple access (TDMA) system,<br><br>
of course other systems such as a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system or a<br>
combination of both, are possible.<br>
The UE 23 may be equipped with any number of antenna ports, but in order for the UE 23 to<br>
be arranged for a MIMO system, it is necessary that the UE 23 is equipped with at least two<br>
antenna ports. When communication commences, the base station 1 adapts to the number of<br>
antenna ports available at the UE 23.<br>
The UE 23 may be equipped with adaptive antennas, which antennas are electrically<br>
controllable in the direction where the highest data bit rate is achieved. The UE 23 may also<br>
be equipped with means (not shown) for determining which orientation of the UE 23 that<br>
provides the best communication properties.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but may vary freely within<br>
the scope of the appended claims. For example, the base station array antenna may have any<br>
suitable configuration of antenna elements, for example 4 columns and 4 rows, forming a 4x4<br>
array antenna, thus being arranged for achieving up to sixteen antenna radiation lobes.<br>
More generally, the base station antenna is an array antenna equipped with at least two<br>
antenna ports, where the at least two ports are connected to respective at least two<br>
corresponding antenna elements, where at least two of the at least two antenna elements have<br>
essentially the same polarization.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, at least two antenna ports must be comprised in the base<br>
station array antenna, the base station array antenna thus being arranged for radiating two<br>
antenna radiation lobes, which is necessary for MIMO communication.<br>
However, assuming that the first embodiment is used for the situation according to Figure 4, it<br>
is conceivable that only one antenna radiation lobe is switched on, since no more antenna<br>
radiation lobes are necessary to achieve optimal communication between the base station 1<br>
and the UE 23.<br><br>
It is of course conceivable that the second embodiment, with controllable antenna radiation<br>
lobes, may be arranged for turning antenna radiation lobes off in the same manner as in the<br>
first embodiment.<br>
The lobes of the base station array antenna 3 according to the second embodiment of the<br>
invention may be controllable in azimuth only, elevation only, or, as in the embodiments<br>
above, both in azimuth and elevation. As known to those skilled in the art, a base station array<br>
antenna that is controllable in both azimuth and elevation has to be two-dimensional, i.e. have<br>
antenna elements in both rows and columns.<br>
For all embodiments, the base station array antenna 3 may further comprise dual polarized<br>
antenna elements, the base station array antenna 3 thus being arranged for communication via<br>
two essentially orthogonal polarizations, thus doubling the information stream transmission<br>
rate.<br>
An example of how dual polarized antenna elements can be arranged is described below with<br>
reference to Figure 6. There, an array antenna 32 is shown, having a first 33, second 34, third<br>
35 and fourth 36 antenna element. Each antenna element 33, 34, 35, 36 comprises at least one<br>
radiating element. The antenna elements 33, 34, 35, 36 are placed in a first 37 and second 38<br>
row and a first 39 and second column 40, forming a 2x2 array antenna 32. The antenna<br>
elements 33, 34, 35, 36 are preferably separated by approximately 0.5-1 wavelengths<br>
(calculated from the centre frequency of the frequency band for which the antennas are<br>
designed) in the horizontal plane for beam-forming in azimuth and approximately 0.5-4<br>
wavelengths in a vertical plane for beam-forming in elevation. Each antenna element 33, 34,<br>
35, 36 is arranged for a first and a second polarization, the polarizations being essentially de-<br>
correlated.<br>
The antenna elements 33, 34, 35, 36 receive and transmit signals using the same frequency<br>
band, for the uplink and another frequency band for the downlink if FDD (Frequency Division<br>
Duplex) is utilized, or using the same frequency band, for both the uplink and the downlink if<br>
TDD (Time Division Duplex) is utilized.<br><br>
In this example, the first polarization of the first 33, second 34, third 35 and fourth 36 antenna<br>
element is connected to respective first 41, second 42, third 43 and fourth 44 feeding lines via<br>
respective first P1a, second P2a, third P3a and fourth P4a antenna ports. In the same way, the<br>
second polarization of the first 33, second 34, third 35 and fourth 36 antenna element is<br>
connected to respective fifth 45, sixth 46, seventh 47 and eighth 48 feeding lines via<br>
respective fifth P1b, sixth P2b, seventh P3b and eighth P4b antenna ports.<br>
The first 41 and second 42 feeding lines, which are connected to the first polarization of the<br>
antenna elements 33, 34 in the first row 37, are connected to a first power divider 49, and the<br>
second 43 and third 44 feeding lines, which are connected to the first polarization of the<br>
antenna elements 35, 36 in the second row 38, are connected to a second power divider 50.<br>
The fifth 45 and seventh 47 feeding lines, which are connected to the second polarization of<br>
the antenna elements 33, 35 in the first column 39, are connected to a third power divider 51,<br>
and the sixth 46 and eighth 48 feeding lines, which are connected to the second polarization of<br>
the antenna elements 34, 36 in the second column 40, are connected to a fourth power divider<br>
52.<br>
The first 49 and second 50 power dividers are connected to a first beam-forming device 53<br>
and the third 51 and fourth 52 power dividers are connected to a second beam-forming device<br>
54. The beam-forming devices 53, 54 are of a previously known kind, for example digital<br>
beam-forming devices. The devices 53, 54 may be combined in one beam-forming device.<br>
By means of this arrangement, the radiation lobes formed by the rows 37, 38, having the first<br>
polarization, may be controlled separate from the radiation lobes formed by the columns 39,<br>
40, having the second polarization. The antenna radiation beams are incoherently added in the<br>
far-field.<br>
Generally, for all embodiments described, since all antenna arrangements are reciprocal, all<br>
features described as concerning transmission, are also applicable concerning reception.<br><br>
Furthermore, the number of base station array antennas 3, base station antenna radiation lobes<br>
24. 25, 26, 27 may vary in any convenient way, provided that the system still is arranged for<br>
MIMO.<br>
As indicated above, the invention is applicable for an arbitrary number of UE:s 23; 23a, 23b,<br>
23c. More than one base station 1 may also be necessary, for example due to the demands for<br>
capacity and/or the layout of the cell 2 environments.<br>
The base station 1 may be a base station in any wireless communication system, such as a<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN).<br><br>
