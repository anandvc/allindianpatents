UREA GREASE  COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a urea grease composition.<br>
Urea grease is known as  heat-resistant grease because it generally has a higher dropping point and superior thermal stability than general-purpose lithium-soap grease containing lithium soap as a thickening agent.<br>
In recent years, it has been discovered that urea grease has superior wear resistance and lubricating properties than greases in which various metal soap and inorganic materials have been used as thickening agents.<br>
It is  thought that the superior wear resistance is because urea grease can form both a urea film and an oxide film on lubricated sliding surfaces.<br>
Urea grease has achieved rapid growth as grease which may be conveniently applied to typical grease-lubricated locations, including a wide variety of bearings for vehicle constant-velocity jointsf ball joints, wheel bearings, alternators and cooling fans, ball screws and linear guides of machine tools, a wide variety of sliding areas of construction equipment, and bearings and gears in steel equipment and various other industrial mechanical facilities.<br>
The usage of urea grease has been rising steadily in particular applicationsr such as various kinds of vehicle parts including CVJs {constant-velocity joints) where there is a strong demand for durability and reduced friction and wear in sliding areas in response to the trend of the present times toward miniaturisation/ weight reduction and a hostile use environment, and in steel<br><br>
equipment which requires highly heat-resistant, wear-resistant lubricating grease.<br>
Although developments are being made year by year in the properties of urea grease, the latest urea grease still has some points to be improved upon, depending on the desired application.<br>
For instance, domestic electric appliances and office automation equipment in particular are required to have appropriate sound characteristics,   whilst it is becoming necessary for vehicle parts to have a low-noise characteristics, abrasion resistance and low friction characteristics which are indispensable thereto.<br>
Taking a vacuum cleaner as a familiar•example of the noises produced by domestic electric appliances and office automation equipment, noise reduction requirements are becoming increasingly severe because the bearings therein have come to revolve at a high speed of 30,000 to 40,000 rpm as the reduction in size and increase in suction in such "equipment has progressed, thereby resulting in high wind noise and tumbling noise.<br>
In addition, it is desirable to minimise noises produced by the bearings of video cameras, video tape recorders and electronic equipment as they act as error signals and adversely affect electronic components.<br>
Therefore, it is very effective if a grease capable of ensuring low noise and high lubricity could be applied to those bearings, and so the development of a grease having improved properties is desired.<br>
Furthermore, the smoothness of vehicles is also being improved year by year under circumstances where progression of energy savings and fuel economy is accelerated, and so quality levels required of individual parts making up vehicles is being raised year by year.<br>
To the sliding areas of these parts, therefore,<br><br>
application of a grease capable ensuring low noise and high lubricity is highly desirable, and it is required to develop a grease having improved properties.<br>
Examples of lubricated parts of vehicles include various kinds of bearings, such as cooling fan bearings of a radiator, compressor bearings of an air conditioner and alternator bearings, constant-velocity joints, universal joints of a propeller shaft, gears and bearings of a steering unit, ball screws, sliding areas of rack guides, and ball joints.<br>
Smooth lubrication, -with low noise and low friction are directly linked to energy savings, fuel economy and smoothness of vehicles, and greases showing excellent properties in those applications are very useful.  Hence, more effective greases are required.<br>
On  the other hand, examples of parts to be lubricated in other industries, which are limited in direct low-noise requirements as compared with vehicles, domestic electric appliances and office automation equipment, include a wide variety of bearings of auto-assembly robots, ball screws and linear guides of machine tools, various sliding areas of construction equipment, and various bearings of steel facilities.<br>
Although the direct low-noise requirements for' greases is limited in such applications, the noise coming out of grease is ascribable not only to a physical noise caused by stirring and flow of grease but also to noises made at the interface between lubricated surfaces (noise caused by extraneous substances on the interface and noises caused by metal~to~metal contact arising from breakage of oil film).<br>
As a matter of course, it can be said that a substandard grease inferior in lubricity and contaminated with extraneous substances is prone to cause breakage of<br><br>
oil film and abrasion at the interface and the generation of unacceptable noise. Accordingly, the sound characteristic thereof is not improved unless lubricity is enhanced.  In other words, greases having favourable sound characteristics mean that the lubricity thereof is also improved.<br>
The low-noise properties of greases are further explained by taking a bearing as an example.  In general, the lubricating mechanism of a grease on a rolling-element bearing is such that the grease which has been packed in the bearing is temporarily swung and scattered by revolution, and thereafter a trace amount of grease or oil is fed to a sliding area as churning and channeling are repeated, thereby lubricating the sliding area. Therein, a sound caused by vibrations occurring between a tumbling element- of the bearing and a rolling surface appears as a bearing noise.<br>
The working precision of the bearing and contamination of the grease with extraneous sub'stances and particles of thickening agent in the grease are factors which cause bearing noise.  The sound characteristics vary considerably with the form and the type of not only dirt and dust intruding into grease but also of the thickening agent incorporated in the grease-In addition, such substances tend to constitute an obstacle to smooth lubrication.<br>
In general, in the case of a urea grease, urea compounds which have been obtained by reacting amine and isocyanate are used as thickening agents and these are dispersed in the oil and maintain the grease state.<br>
Urea grease is generally superior to soap grease in abrasion resistance because the urea compound(s) used therein as a thickening agent are likely to adsorb to metal surfaces.  However, many of the urea compounds<br><br>
obtained by the afore-mentioned reaction between amine and isocyanate are in a hard granular state, thereby impairing the sound characteristics and having an adverse effect on smooth lubrication.<br>
JP-A-1-139696, JP-A-2-77494 and JP-A-6-17080 concern the acoustic properties of urea grease.<br>
JP-A-1-139696 discloses a thickening agent containing a mixture of diurea compounds (a) and (b) represented by the following formulae (a) and (b), respectively:<br>
(a)	R1NHCONHR2NHCONHR3<br>
(b)	R4NHCONHR5NHCONHR6<br>
wherein R2 is a diphenylmethane group, R^ and R3 each<br>
represents a C8 linear or branched saturated alkyl group, R5 represents a tolylene group or a bitolylene group, and<br>
R4 and R5 each represents an alkyl-substituted aromatic<br>
group or a halogen-substituted aromatic group.<br>
JP-A-2-77494 discloses a thickening agent containing a mixture of diurea compounds (a) and (b) represented by the foregoing formulae (a) and (b) wherein, however, R2<br>
represents a bitolylene group, R1 and R3 each represent a<br>
C18 linear or branched saturated alkyl group or unsaturated alkyl group, R5 represents a diphenylmethane<br>
group, and R4 and Rg represent C8 linear or branched<br>
saturated alkyl groups.<br>
JP-A-6-17080 discloses a thickening agent containing a mixture of diurea compounds (a) and (b) represented by the foregoing formulae (a) and (b) wherein, however, R2<br>
represents a tolylene group, R^ and R3 represent C16-18<br>
linear or branched saturated alkyl groups or unsaturated alkyl groups, R5 represents a diphenylmethane group, and<br><br>
R4 and R6 represent C8 linear or branched saturated alkyl groups.<br>
The following are other examples of literature on acoustic properties.<br>
JP-A-3-28299 discloses a grease composition wherein the base oil containing an alkyldiphenyl ether oil as an essential component is mixed with a thickening agent which is a diurea compound represented by the foregoing formula (a) wherein, however, R2 represents a C6-15<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon group, and R1 and R3 represent C8-18<br>
linear alkyl groups, provided that the proportion of C8 alkyl groups in the combination of R1 and R3 is from 60<br>
to 100 mole %.<br>
Page 8, Table 2 of JP-A-2-80493 discloses a •composition for circular conical roller bearings which is prepared by admixing urea grease with 0.5 to 5 % by weight of oxidation-modified polyolefin and/or acid-modified polyolefin, and further discloses in Table 2 the urea thickening agents prepared from C8 octylamine, C18 stearylamine (octadecylamine) and MDI (diphenylmethane-4,4r-diisocyanate) and demonstrates that these agents produce beneficial effects on machine stability, wet shear stability and pressure transferability.<br>
JP-A-3-243696 discloses a diurea compound represented by the foregoing formula (a) wherein, however, R2 is a 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-biphenylene group and<br>
R]_ and R3 are mixtures of C8-18 alkyl groups with an<br>
oleyl group.  The art disclosed in this document has defects that the consistency yield is so low that grease having a consistency of about 250 cannot be obtained without increasing the amount of the thickening agent and the degree of oil separation under high temperature conditions is great.<br><br>
JP-A-58-185693 discloses a diurea grease improved by incorporating therein one or more of an additive selected from alkenylsuccinic acid imides, metal salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, or metal salts of petroleum sulfonic acid.  The document further discloses the use of diisocyanate and monoamines for the diurea grease, and recites aliphatic amines, such as stearylamine and oleylamine, and aromatic amines, such as cyclohexylamine, as examples of those monoamines.  Said document indicates that the sound characteristics of said grease were favourable.<br>
Further cases are cited below where production methods are examined in order to improve the sound characteristics of urea grease.<br>
For instance, JP-A-2-4895 discloses a urea grease preparation method enabling improvement in sound characteristics, wherein an isocyanate and an amine are added to a base oil and reacted with each other at a<br>
temperature of 60 to 120°C, and then the mixture of a urea compound produced and the base oil is subjected to dispersion treatment by use of a kneading apparatus and<br>
further heated up to 160 to 180°C at a temperature-rising<br>
speed of 0.5 to 2°C per minute.<br>
JP-A-3-190996 discloses a method of preparing greases which are said to have good sound characteristics, wherein the isocyanate-dissolved or dispersed base oil and the amine-dissolved or dispersed base oil ai;e mixed through collisions by pressurizing them in a reaction vessel to cause reaction with each otherf or they are pressurized and introduced to an revolving impeller, thereby causing reaction with each other.<br><br>
In addition, JP-A-3-231993 discloses a method of preparing low-noise urea grease, which includes the first step of heating the mixture constituted of 2 to 30 % by weight of a urea compound represented by the foregoing formula (a), wherein R1 and R3 are C8-18 saturated alkyl<br>
groups and R2 is a tolylene group, a diphenylmethane group or a dimethylbiphenylene group, and 98 to 70 % by weight of a base oil up to 170 to 230°C to thoroughly dissolve the urea compound into the base oil, and the second step of cooling the solution obtained in the first<br>
step at a speed of at least 5°C per second.<br>
As in the above documents, in many cases tolylenediisocyanate (TDI) or 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4' -biphenylenediisocyanate (TODI) have been used as starting materials for obtaining urea grease compositions having good sound characteristics.<br>
With respect to the preparation methods thereof, the agglomeration of urea compounds is avoided by using kneading apparatus, performing the reaction in a high-pressure vessel, or dissolving two or more kinds of grease by heating and then mixing them.<br>
As urea grease production rises and the demand for low noise greases grows, there is demand for a clean working environment for grease production and better sound characteristics in the final products.<br>
Many users demand an inexpensive high-performance greaser and urea greases using high-cost TODI as a raw material and requiring a complicated production process will not be commercially competitive.<br>
Furthermore, from a Health and Safety perspective, increase in grease production requires additional care with regard to the handling of TDI as a raw material and the installation of special equipment.  As a result, it<br><br>
is required to consider reinforcing production facilities for improvement in sound characteristics and extending production process time.<br>
There have now been found in the present invention specific urea grease compositions having a satisfactory consistency yield, with little oil separation at high temperature and with outstanding sound properties and lubricating properties.  In addition,, said urea grease compositions may be produced in conventional grease-making facilities without the need for specialised equipment such as high-pressure kettles or kneading machines in order to disperse the thickening agent.<br>
The urea grease compositions of the present invention have good lubrication capabilities and can easily spread on and are strongly adsorbed to friction surfaces.  In addition, the intervened thickening function of the urea compounds in said grease composition is not an obstacle therein as extraneous matter. Therefore, the urea grease composition of the present invention causes no noise, and, in addition, can enhance the strength of oil film by its viscoelasticity and can form more effective lubrication film on sliding surfaces under a synergy with additives.  Thus, favourable grease lubrication can be attained.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a urea grease composition comprising a lubricating base oil and from 2 to 30 wt.% of a thickening agent, with respect to the total weight of the urea grease composition and wherein said thickening agent is selected from: (1)  a mixture comprising a compound (a) and a compound (b), containing compound (a) at 20 to 80 mol%,<br>
relative to the total amount of compound (a) and compound (b);<br><br>
(2)	a mixture formed by mixing a compound (c) with a mixture (1); or<br>
(3)	a compound (c) alone,<br>
wherein the compounds are represented by the general formulae<br>
(a)	RXNHCONHR2NHCONHR1;<br>
(b)	R3NHCONHR2NHCONHR3; and<br>
(c)	R1NHCONHR2NHCONHR3,<br>
and wherein R2 is a diphenylmethane group,   R1 is a<br>
C6-10 saturated alkyl group and R3 is a C14-20<br>
saturated and/or unsaturated alkyl group, wherein unsaturated alkyl groups constitute at least 20 mol% of the R3 alkyl group.<br>
Preferably, unsaturated alkyl groups constitute at least 25 mol%, more preferably at least 30 mol% of the R3<br>
alkyl group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention Rl is a saturated C8 alkyl group and/or R3 is a C14-20<br>
saturated and/or unsaturated alkyl group wherein unsaturated alkyl groups constituting at least 20 mol% of the R3 alkyl group are oleyl groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a urea grease composition comprising a lubricating base oil and from 2 to 30 wt.% of a thickening agent, with respect to the total weight of the urea grease composition and wherein said thickening agent is selected from:<br>
(!)  a mixture comprising compound (a) and compound (b) , containing compound (a) at 20 to 80 mol%, relative to the total amount of compound (a) and compound (b);<br><br>
(2)	a mixture formed by mixing a compound (c) with a mixture (1); or<br>
(3)	a compound (c) alone,<br>
wherein the compounds are represented by the general formulae<br>
(a)	RXNHCONHR2NHCONHR1 ;<br>
(b)	R3NHCONHR2NHCONHR3; and<br>
(c)	R1NHCONHR2NHCONHR3,<br>
and wherein R2 is a diphenylmethane group, R1 is a<br>
C8 saturated alkyl group, R3 is a C14-20 saturated and/or<br>
unsaturated alkyl group, with the alkyl groups being such that this constituent includes at least 20 mol% of an oleyl constituent.<br>
In the present invention, a urea grease having outstanding characteristics and performance is obtained when a thickening agent as described above is incorporated into a lubricating base oil in an amount of from 2 to 30 wt%, preferably from 5 to 20 wt% with respect to the total weight of the urea grease composition.  When the content of urea compounds as thickening agent is less than 2 wt%, the thickening effect is small and it is impossible to form a grease. On the other hand, when the content of urea compounds as thickening agent exceeds 30 wt%, the grease becomes too stiff and no lubricating effect is obtained.<br>
When the proportion of the urea grease composition constituted by compound (a) in mixture (1) is less than 20 mol% or exceeds 80 mol%, relative to the total amount of compound (a) and compound (b), there is little effect of using the mixture and there is no improvement in noise performance or oil separation.<br>
The lubricating base oil used in the urea grease composition of the present invention, may conveniently be<br><br>
one  or more of a vegetable oil, a mineral oil, and/or a synthetic oil.<br>
Base oils of mineral origin may be mineral oils, for example those produced by solvent refining or hydroprocessing-<br>

example liquid polymers of alpha-olefins (poly(α-olefin)), ester type synthetic oils, silicone oils and/or ether type synthetic oils.  They may also be a mixture of these oils.<br>
Examples of mineral oils that may conveniently be used include those sold by member companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group under the designations WHVI", "MVIN", or ^HMVIP".<br>
Polyalphaolefins and base oils of the type manufactured by the hydroisomerisation of wax, such as those sold by member companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group under the designation *XHVI" (trade mark), may also be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the urea grease composition of the present invention further includes a zinc compound as an additive.<br>

Similarly, specific examples of zinc dithiophosphates include zinc diethyldithiophosphate, zinc dipropyldithio-phosphate, zinc dibutyldithiophosphate, zinc dipentyl-dithiophosphate, zinc dihexyldithiophosphate, zinc didecyldithiophosphate, zinc diisobutyldithiophosphate, -zinc di(2-ethylhexyl)dithiophosphate, zinc diamyldithio-phosphate, zinc dilauryldithiophosphate, zinc distearyl-dithiophosphate, zinc diphenyldithiophosphate, zinc ditolyldithiophosphate, zinc dixylyldithiophosphate, zinc diethylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc dipropylphenyldithio-.phosphate, zinc dibutylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc dipentylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc dihexylphenyldithio-phosphate, zinc diheptylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc dioctylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc dinonylphenyldithio-phosphate, zinc didecylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc didodecylphenyldithiophosphate, zinc ditetradecylphenyl-dithiophosphate and zinc dihexaphenyldithiophosphate. The metallic elements such as S or P in these organometallic zinc compounds react with iron in frictional surfaces to form extreme pressure films of iron phosphide or iron sulphide, etc.; and the additive itself breaks down and inter-reacts with other additives to form a protective film-Furthermore, surprisingly, the urea grease compositions of the present invention exhibit outstanding lubricating properties due to synergistic effects of such S-P type additives with the urea thickening agents of the<br><br>
present invention, which have outstanding penetration into the interface and adsorption.<br>
