The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for producing displays of analog operating parameters on a display screen, wherein a character production means is controlled in such a way that it produces a display signal which comprises a number of characters, wherein the number of characters is approximately proportional to the level or the number of the set increments of the operating parameter associated with the signal. A method of that kind is known from DE-A-29 20 023.<br>
The known method is implemented in a large number of variations in connection with the most widely varying types of display screen display apparatuses, for example monitors, television receivers, satellite receivers, projectors and the like.<br>
Figure 2a) is a diagrammatic view of one of the best-known display screen display variations.<br>
The known display screen displays, referred to as on-screen displays, can be put into two essential categories: a symbolic display and a numerical display. In the case of the symbolic display, characters, almost exclusively abstract characters, are produced, and the number of characters produced is approximately proportional to the level of the operating parameter or the number of the set increments of the incrementally settable operating parameter. Thus Figure 2a) illustrates an example in which six vertically oriented bars -as first characters - reproduce for the user information about the current setting of the operating parameter.<br>
In the known numerical display screen display, a number, for example the number 6, is superimposed on the display screen and the number itself is approximately proportional to the level of the operating parameter and/or the number of the set increments of the operating parameter. It will be appreciated that hybrid forms of the symbolic and the numerical display are also to be encountered.<br>
In Figure 2a), small, approximately square characters -as second characters -are also arranged to the right of the vertically disposed elongate bars so that the user knows to what extent he has controlled the operating parameter to be displayed because the total number of characters (bars and small characters) gives him a measurement in respect of the maximum degree of control of the operating parameter.<br><br>
The above-described display screen displays have for the major part proved their worth, which has also lead to the result that display screen displays of the above-described kind are used in more than 90% of all television receivers, monitors, satellite receivers or other installations in entertainment electronics because the display screen displays enable the user to set a desired operating parameter in the optimum fashion and easily, without being dependent on the reproduction of a given video signal, because the display screen display gives the user a clear indication of the setting of the operating parameter. Besides a large number of advantages in the display screen display which is independent of the reception of a video signal however the previous screen displays also suffer from some disadvantages. Thus, in the case of a display screen display as is shown in Figure 2a), the user can scarcely quickly recognise the number of first characters and therefore can only note a desired setting, with very great difficulty. Admittedly, the individual characters can be distinguished from each other in the case of the display screen display shown in Figure 2a), and can therefore be clearly recognised, but, if the user would like to note a setting, he must count off the individual characters and note that number, like the number involved in a numerical display.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to support the powers of recollection of the viewer or the user of the display screen display apparatus, and to provide a simple mode of operation in that respect. In accordance with the invention that object is achieved by the method and the display screen display apparatus, recited in the claims.<br>
The invention is based on the realisation that the powers of recollection in respect of colour and shape of a human being are generally markedly better than the powers of recollection for numbers. Thus even after 20 years the owner of a motorcar knows what colour his first motorcar was, while he has already long ago forgotten the registration plate at that time. It is also usually difficult for people to note numbers at all, for example telephone numbers, house numbers, etc. As already mentioned above,<br><br>
the same also applies in regard to a numerical item of information in connection with a display screen display, especially as the user is generally so diverted by the reproduced image on the screen that he scarcely concentrates on the number of characters or on a number of a numerical display itself.<br>
By means of the invention it is also in part no longer in any way necessary to note the number of characters if the user concentrates only on that character which refers to the increment that was last set or to the current value of the operating parameter. Admittedly, in the case of previous display screen displays, the user also looks at that character but, because that character is identical (in colour and shape) to all other adjacent characters, for example in Figure 2a) to the left of the right- hand bar, the user, by virtue of the position of the character itself, cannot gain any impression about the value of the set operating parameter, but must count off all characters.<br>
In the present invention however adjacent characters or characters of successive parameter values are of a different appearance, for example in terms of their colour and/or shape. Various examples in this respect are shown in Figure I. In the case of a numerical display the number display is associated with a given colour and/or value, that it to say, with a change in the numerical display, there is also always a change in colour and/or shape in respect of the numerical intormation itself or its background. The user therefore only needs to note the associated colour and/or shape, instead of a number, in order to return to a desired setting or to note the current value.<br>
The production of different colour signals tor adjacent characters means that the individual characters appear on the display on the display screen in different colours, which not only serves to help the memory of the user, but also markedly improves the aesthetic appearance of the display screen display.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of producing displays of analog operating parameters on a display screen, wherein a production means is controlled in such a way that it produces a display signal which comprises a number of characters, wherein the number of characters is proportional to the level and/or the<br><br>
number of the set increments of the operating parameters associated with the signal, characterized in that the character production means produces a colour signal for each character and the colour signals of adjacent characters differ and/or associated with a setting value of an operating parameter is a colour and/or shape signal which is displayed upon setting of the operating parameter to the setting value and/or the colour and shape signals of successive setting values differ.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a display screen display apparatus, by means of which a display signal of a physical parameter can be produced, wherein the display signal comprises a numerical display value and/or a number of characters, wherein the number of characters is approximately proportional to the level and/or the number of the set increments of the setting value associated with the signal, characterized in that a colour and/or shape signal is associated with a setting value and that the colour and/or shape signals of adjacent characters or groups of characters of the setting values of the operating parameters differ and/or associated with a setting value of an operating parameter is a colour and/or shape signal which can be called up when the setting value of the operating parameter is called up and that the colour and/or shape signals of successive setting values of the operating parameters differ.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to embodiments illustrated in the drawings in which:<br>

Figure la shows a display screen display or on-screen display comprising a group of first characters which are characterized by vertically oriented coloured bars and a group of second characters which are arranged in the form of smaller squares to the right of the bars. Adjacent characters are of clearly different colours. The display illustrated in Figure 1 indicates to the user that he has effected setting of a physical operating parameter, the setting corresponding to the first six characters, and that the blue first character refers to the increment that was last set. If the user increases the value of the operating parameter, then depending on the respective proportionality of the association of the first characters with the called-up increments, the second character in brown which is arranged to the right of the blue first character in Figure 1 is sooner or later replaced by a character shape corresponding to the first character, but it remains pink in colour. Such a setting is shown in Figure lb.<br>
The user does not absolutely have to remember the number of the first characters in order later to call up the desired setting again, but automatically retains the colour of that first character which refers to the desired setting.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible for the second characters to appear throughout in the same colour or for the characters which are arranged to the left of the blue character in Figure la to be of a plain colour. It is important however that a given value of a physical parameter or the character representing it appears in a given colour on the display screen. Therefore adjacent characters or operating parameter values should preferably always appear or be symbolised on the display screen in different colours. It will be appreciated that it is also possible for a given sequence of colours to be repeated, after a given number of characters.<br>
Figure Ic shows an alternative display screen display, wherein the first characters are represented by capital letters and the second characters are represented by lower-case letters. The individual characters also differ from each other, by virtue of their letter values.<br>
Figure Id shows a display screen display comparable to Figure la, wherein the first characters are merged together to form a bar because there are no gaps between adjacent first characters.<br>
In Figure 1e adjacent characters are formed by a different character shape. The second characters are omitted in Figure If. It is self-evident that the incorporation of a numerical display can be selectively effected, as in Figures la and lb, or can replace the abstract characters.<br>
In Figure Ig only that character which indicates the current value of the operating parameter is in colour. If the value of the operating parameter is increased and a further first character is called up it appears in a different colour, for example yellow, and all characters to the left of the coloured character (now yellow) are of a plain colour.<br>
Figure Ih shows a blue bar which comprises a plurality of blue rectangles which are merged together to form one bar. With an increase in the operating parameter value by a further increment, that is to say with the setting value being increased by a further unit -see Figure Ij -the entire bar becomes yellow and the number of characters, that is to say in the rectangle, is increased by 1.<br><br>
Figure 2a shows a known plain-colour display screen display representation; Figure 2b shows a display screen display representation in which the step width or the incremental change of an operating parameter in the region of the maximum values is markedly greater than in the region of the normal setting, for example in respect of volume suitable for a room.<br>
In that case the magnitude or length of an individual character is approximately proportional to the corresponding incremental change. That enables the user to set very fine differences in the region of the normal setting, for example in respect of room volume, while greater increment step widths are provided in the region of the maximum and minimum values respectively, because experience has shown that very fine setting is less important to the user in those areas. When setting the level of volume, the following associations between the characters and the incremental change/step width can be involved:<br>
Character 1	10 dB<br>
Character 2	8 dB<br>
Character 3	6 dB<br>
Character 4	4 dB<br>
Character 5	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 6	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 7	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 8	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 9	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 10	0.5 to 1 dB<br>
Character 11	4 dB<br>
Character 12	6 dB<br>
Character 13	8 dB<br>
Character 14	10 dB<br><br>
This therefore makes available to the user a simplification in terms of operation which meets his personal wishes and which at the same time enables him to arrive at a picture about the actual setting of an operating parameter.<br>
Figure 3 shows a block circuit diagram of a reproduction installation, in the illustrated example a television receiver, with a receiving antenna 1 which is connected to a tuner 2 with variable capacitance diodes. A signal which is converted to an immediate frequency IF is available at the output of the tuner. The tuner 2 can be of known design configuration and essentially comprises a selective amplifier stage, a mixer and an internal oscillator.<br>
The output of the oscillator is connected to a first frequency divider 3 which divides the output frequency of the oscillator by a fixedly predetermined divisor N. The output of 'the first frequency divider is connected to the signal input of a second frequency divider 4 which divides the output frequency of the first frequency divider by a variable divisor N and which can be actuated with 12-bit programming signals so that it can divide by any divisor N between 1 and 2  .<br>
The output of the second frequency divider 4 is connected to a first input of a phase frequency comparator 5, to the second input of which is applied a reference signal which is supplied by a quartz generator 6 by way of third frequency divider 7. The output of the comparator 5 is connected by way an amplifier and filter circuit 8 to the control input of the tuner 2.<br>
The arrangement also has a control unit 10, for example a remote control, which, besides the usual control buttons for switching on and off, volume, brightness, contrast and colour balance, additionally has 10 digit buttons which are identified by 0 to 9 (or as letter buttons with the letters A to L). Provided on the control unit 10 there are also seven auxiliary buttons which are identified by the symbols +, -, t, c, or, m and ct (or +, -, rl, r2, r3, r4 and ct).<br>
The control unit 10 is connected to a first group of eight input/output connections of a processor 11 and to the address inputs of a memory 12. The processor 11 also has a second set of eight input/output connections which   are<br><br>
connected to the data input/output connections of the memory 12 and also to the inputs of a character graphic generator 16 which can be connected to a display unit 9 (which is a component of the picture tube of the receiver unit). A third group of 16 connections of the processor 11 is connected to the following connections of the further circuits:<br>
to 12 programming inputs of the second frequency divider 4,<br>
to 2 band switching-over inputs (U and B III) of the tuner 2,<br>
to a control input of the character generator 16, and<br>
to a first input of a combining circuit 14. The memory 12 also has two control inputs which are connected to the output of the combining circuit 14 which receives at a second input a signal of the processor 11 and at a third input a signal from a switch-on detector 15. The detector 15 in turn receives a signal from the main voltage supply of the television receiver while its output is additionally connected to a reset input of the processor 11. The memory 12 and the combining circuit 14 which is made up CMOS-elements and has a low level of power consumption are connected to an internal memory voltage source, in particular a battery 13.<br>
The circuits 3,4,5 and 8, together with the internal voltage-control oscillator (VCO) of the tuner 2 form a phase-locked loop which is controlled in known manner by the output signal of the quartz generator 6; which output signal is divided down by the third frequency divider 7.<br>
With suitable control by way of the keypad, using in part conventional procedures, it is possible to have various modes of operation in order to effect tuning to a predetermined transmission station.<br>
If the user actuates an operating parameter setting button on the remote control, a display screen display automatically appears, in the configuration as shown in Figure 1. In the operating parameter setting operation, a command is sent from the remote control to the installation to be controlled and that command is processed by the processor 11. To control the operating parameter, the processor 11 is connected to the<br><br>
memory 12 in which the operating parameter data and the corresponding step widths of the operating parameters are stored. The processor 11 is also connected to the character generator 16 which also has a character store or memory for superimposing the display screen display. The shape and/or colour signals or data associated with a setting value of an operating parameter are stored in the processor 11 or preferably together with the individual setting values in the memory 12 and called up when a given parameter is set and are transmitted to the character generator as a suitable colour or shape command. The colour and/or shape signals of successive setting values are different, as described above, in which respect a large number of variations can be envisaged for suitable reproduction, of which Figure 1 shows only some advantageous examples.<br>
For the sake of improved comprehension of the display screen display representation, attention is now directed to Figure 4. In Figure 4 the display screen display menu system 101 comprises three functional blocks, an input, memory and control block 121, a video display setting block 141 and a character display block 161. Within the block 121 which is either part of an installation front control 181 or a PC-connection 201, suitable keys or buttons for setting selected operating parameters in the system 101 can be operated. The input values are stored for a given time in an intermediute memory 221. A microcontroller 241 receives those items of input information from the input intermediate memory 221 and stores the altered input values of the operating parameter to be displayed, in an EEPROM 251.<br>
The microcontroller 241 is connected in the display setting block 141 to a digital/analog converter 281 (DAC) which converts a digital setting value into an analog signal and suitably transmits it to an analog switch so that an operating parameter value assumes its value that is wanted by the user.<br>
The character display block 161 contains the hardware for producing and emitting the display screen display information to a display unit (not shown). The mode of operation of character production itself is   known for   example    from<br><br>
EP 0 543 089. A suitable command from the microcontroller 241 causes characters of predetermined size, shape and colour to be selected from the character memory (character PROM) 421 and assembled to give a display screen display line in the display memory 401. The result is outputted to the display unit by way of a video drive device 481 and thus appears on the desired display screen in the desired form. If there is a change in the value of an operating parameter and therewith the number of the first characters, a correspondingly altered display screen display line composition is produced and displayed.<br>
An operating parameter can only assume predetermined values which are finally stored in the control block 121, for example in the form of a table in the memory 251.<br>
If it is intended for example that, on each increase in volume which can only occur in a stepwise manner, an increase in volume of 5 dB is intended with the next higher volume value, the incremental change is thus 5 dB. The desired incremental changes can be established beforehand by suitable storage. By virtue of suitable program association of an operating parameter with a character, it is possible to associate with a corresponding increment, corresponding items of character information, shape, colour, size etc., and corresponding display screen displays can thus be assembled.<br>
Figure 5 a shows a view of part of an electronic installation, for example a television receiver 200 or a monitor. The installation has a single-member setting element 201 by means of which both different operating parameter modes can be called up and also set up in respect of value, and with which moreover the installation can be switched on and off<br>
The single-member setting element 201 is a setting element which is rotatable and which can be pressed in and/or pulled out. Associated with the setting element, see Figure 5b, is a movement sensor 204 which detects corresponding operating actions of the operating member and converts them into corresponding signals which<br><br>
are evaluated by a signal evaluation control unit 205, for example a microprocessor, and converted into command signals. Those command signals are used for the desired control of the installation and also for calling up a desired display screen display signal 202 on the display screen 203.<br>
The operating member may also be connected to a time switch 206 which detects the time duration of an operating action and sends a suitable time signal to the evaluation unit. If for example the setting element is pressed for a given time (that is to say pushed into the plane of the drawing) the time switch, after a predetermined period of time has been exceeded, sends a command to the evaluation unit which evaluates that signal as a switch-off or switch-on signal, depending on which state was previously prevailing, and switches the installation on or off<br>
As long as the setting element is pressed in or pulled out only for a predetermined relatively short period of time, that is evaluated as meaning that the user would like to set a next operating parameter mode. For that purpose, the display screen displays a corresponding menu system -Figure 5c -in which an operating mode, for example volume, brightness etc. is indicated by means of a suitable pointer, for example a cursor or a suitable colour marking. If the pointer points to an operating mode such as volume, the user can set the desired value by rotating the operating member. Upon being rotated towards the left, the value of the operating parameter is reduced while upon being rotated towards the right the value of the operating parameter is increased while a display screen representation 202 as shown in Figure 1 appears on the display screen.<br>
Thus all desired functions of the installation to be controlled can be operated with a single operating member.<br>
If now the user presses the setting member for longer than for example 2 seconds, a corresponding switch-off signal is detected by the evaluation unit and the installation is entirely switched off<br><br>
The switch-off function can also be achieved by the operating member being pushed in after overcoming a pressure point -see Figure 5d -and by a corresponding switch-off contact which provides for switching off the installation being made after the operating member moves into the installation. Moving or pulling the setting member 201 out of the installation can then switch it on. In the view shown in Figure 5d the operating member 201 has a head 215 which, when the operating member is pushed in, is received by two spring-mounted shell portions 216,217. When the spring pressure is suitably overcome, the shell portions contact corresponding co-operating contact portions 218 and 219, thus making a switching contact which causes the installation to be switched off.<br>
The operating member is a very advantageous supplement to the above-described display screen display, but it can also be embodied independently thereof It will be appreciated that the single-member setting element 201 may also be provided on a remote control, as shown in Figure 5e. Such a remote control then only has a single operating member with which all or most operating functions can be set. It will be appreciated that a known ten-button keypad can also be provided for program selection. Admittedly "trackballs" or "jock shuttles" are known on remote controls, but they do not have a switch-off function.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
