COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
MULTIPOLE OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE RELIABLE OPERATION OF A MULTIPOLE OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION SYSTEM<br>
PHOENIX CONTACT GMBH &amp; CO. KG of FLACHSMARKTSTR. 8, 32825 BLOMBERG, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
Original<br>
  00038/MUMNP/2004                                 <br>
                                                                        30-6-2005  <br><br>
                                                              Granted<br><br>
The invention relates to a multi-polar surge protection system for a multi-phase current supply network, in particular, a low voltage network, with at least two surge protection elements, whereby in each line branch of the current supply network, a surge protection element is arranged. In addition, the invention also relates to a method for the safe operation of such a multi-polar surge protection system.<br>
Electrical, in particular, however, electronic measuring, control, regulating, and switch circuits, and also for telecommunication units and assemblies are susceptible to transient over-voltages, commonly called power surges, such as those than can occur through atmospheric charges, or also through switch activity or short circuits in energy supply networks. This susceptibility has been used increasingly in electronic components, in particular, transistors and thyristors; above all, integrated circuitries are increasingly endangered in great numbers by transient power surges.<br>
Electrical circuits work with the specified voltage, the rated voltage, normally failure-free. This is not the case when power surges occur. Power surges are all voltages, which lie above the upper tolerance limit of the rated voltage. In this regard, also the transient power surges are counted, which based on atmospheric charges, however, also by switch activity or short circuits, can occur in energy supply networks and can be coupled galvanically, inductively, or capacitively in electric circuitry. In order to protect electrical or electronic circuitry against power surges, in particular, electronic measuring, control, regulating, and switching circuits, as well as telecommunication<br><br>
units and assemblies, where also they are used, power surge protection elements have been developed and have been known for more than 20 years.<br>
An essential component of power surge protection elements of the type taught here, which is commonly designated as a lighting arrestor, is at least a spark gap, which with a determined power surge, activates the operating voltage and therewith prevents power surges from occurring in the circuitry protected by a power surge protection element that are greater than the operating voltage of the spark gap.<br>
The spark gaps of the initially named power surge protection elements are formed primarily as air breakdown spark gaps, that is, they have two electrodes, between which the air breakdown spark gap is provided or active. With air breakdown spark gaps, generally a breakdown spark gap is meant; included, then, also is a breakdown spark gap, with which not air, but a different gas, is provided between the electrodes. In addition to power surge protection elements with an air flashover spark gap, power surge protection elements with an air flashover spark gap are provided, with which upon activation, a creepage charge occurs.<br>
Power surge protection elements with an air breakdown<br>
spark gap,  in contrast with power surge protection<br>
elements with an air flashover spark gap, have the<br>
advantage of a higher surge current carrying capacity,<br>
however, the disadvantage of a higher - and also not<br>
rather  constant-  operating  voltage.  Thus,  already<br>
different power surge protection elements are proposed<br>
with an air breakdown spark gap, which with reference<br>
to the operating voltage, have been improved. In this<br>
manner, in the area of the electrodes or the active air<br><br><br>
breakdown spark gap between the electrodes, were realized in various manners with the sparking or ignition aids, for example, such between the electrodes, at least one creepage charge releasing ignition aid was provided, which at least partially projects into the air breakdown spark gap, is designed as graduated, and is made of plastic (compare, for example, the German disclosure documents 41 41 681 or 44 02 615).<br>
The previously mentioned ignition or sparking aids with the known power surge protection elements can be designated as "passive sparking aids", "passive sparking aids" because they themselves activate "actively", rather only by means of a power surge, which acts on the main electrode.<br>
From the German published document 198 03 636, likewise<br>
a power surge protection element with two electrodes is<br>
known, with an active air breakdown spark gap between<br>
the two electrodes and an ignition or sparking aid.<br>
With this known power surge protection element, the<br>
sparking aid, in contract to the previously mentioned<br>
types, forms a creepage charge releasing sparking aid<br>
as an "active sparking aid", namely in that in addition<br>
to the two electrodes - here designated as main<br>
electrodes - two more sparking electrodes are provided.<br>
These  two  sparking electrodes  form a  second air<br>
breakdown spark gap, serving as an ignition spark gap.<br>
With this known power surge protection element,  an<br>
ignition circuit belongs to the ignition aid outside of<br>
the  ignitions  spark gap with an  ignition switch<br>
element. Upon contact of a power surge to the known<br>
power surge protection element, the ignition circuit<br>
with  the  ignition  switch element provides  for an<br>
activation of the ignition spark, gap. The ignition<br>
spark gap or the two ignition electrodes are arranged<br><br>
with reference to the two main electrodes such that, thereby, it has activated the ignition spark gap, the air breakdown spark gap between the two main electrodes, called the main spark gap, activates. The activation of the ignition spark gap leads to an ionization of the air provided in the air breakdown spark gap, so that, abruptly, after activation of the ignition spark gap, then also the air breakdown spark gap between the two main electrodes, that is, the main spark gap, activates.<br>
With the known, previously described embodiments of power surge protection elements with ignition aids, the ignition aids lead to an improved, specifically lower and more contact operating voltage.<br>
For protection from power surges of the central current supply in a lower voltage network, three or four-pole surge protection apparatus are known, in which individual power surge protection elements are interconnected to a surge protection system and arranged in a common housing. The individual surge protection elements protect respectively only one individual line branch of the current supply network. In this manner, depending on the switching of the surge protection apparatus, the provided protection level is ensured only between the active phase conductors (Ll, L2, L3) and the neutral conductor (N) or between the neutral conductor (N) and the ground wire (PE) or between the active phase conductors (Ll, L2, L3) and the ground wire (PE) or between the neutral conductor (N) and the ground wire (PE) . In particular, between the individual active phase conductors (Ll, L2, L3), the protection level is not ensured.<br>
From the British published document GB 2,179,214 A an surge protection system is well-known, which consists<br><br><br>
of one or more cylindrical gas discharge tubes. Main electrodes are arranged at the two outside ends of a cylindrical gas discharge tubes and additionally an ignition electrode in function of an ignition assistance is arranged co-axially in the interior between the two electrodes. In order to wire two active phase conductors, multiple count of these cylindrical gas discharge tubes are axially connected. In this described case a wiring of more than two active phase conductors is not possible, since the centric arrangement of the one ignition electrode is limited to provides ignition assistance only for the two outside electrodes of the active phase conductors.<br>
However, based on inductive or capacitive coupling (inductive disturbances) upon occurrence of a surge in only one line branch, a surge takes place in another line branch,  even when the surge is small, which however, does not lead to a switching of the surge protection element of this line branch. In addition, also  with,  in  effect,  similarly  designed  surge protection  elements  and  similarly  designed  line branches,  in the event of a surge,  an non-uniform fragmentation of the sum surge current occurs,  in particular, then, when the individual surge protection elements switch in sa  delayed manner or individual surge protection elements do not switch at all. In practice, now multi-polar surge protection apparatus with a shunting or leading off capability to a determined size of the sum surge current are offered, with which the individual surge protection elements, however, only can shunt off a corresponding fraction (1/3 or 1/4 with three or four line branches) of the provided sum surge current. If this leads only to an asymmetrical current distribution with these multi-polar surge protection apparatus, then this can lead to an overload of the individual surge protection elements.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the object of making available a multi-polar surge protection system, with which the desired level of protection is ensured between all line ranches, that nevertheless can be manufactured constructively simple and cost-effectively. In addition, the invention has the object of providing a method for the safe operation of a multi-polar surge protection system, with which the achievement of a desired level of protection between all line branches of a multi-phase current supply network is guaranteed.<br>
The inventive multi-polar power surge protection system, with which the previously stated objects are resolved, is characterized in that the individual surge protection elements are coupled to one another such that upon ignition "-of a surge protection element, all of the other surge protection elements are also ignited.<br>
If a surge acts on the inventive multi-polar surge protection system in one line branch, which is greater than the operating voltage, this leads to the ignition of the surge protection element arranged in this line branch. Because the individual surge protection elements are coupled to one another in the inventive manner, then an ignition of the surge protection elements in the other line branches takes place automatically. In this manner, the desired level of protection between all line branches is guaranteed and a symmetrical distribution of the sum surge current is ensured.<br>
The coupling of the individual surge protection elements with one another can be realized through different features. According to a first preferred embodiment  of  the  surge protection  system of  the<br><br>
present invention, the individual surge protection elements each have an ignition aid, whereby the individual ignition aids are coupled to one another. As ignition aids, the above-described "passive ignition aids" as well as the previously described "active ignition aids" can be used. If "active ignition aids" are used, which have an ignition circuit with an ignition switch element in addition to an ignition electrode, then the individual ignition elements of the individual ignition aids are electrically connected to one another.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the multi¬polar surge protection system of the present invention, a central ignition aid is provided, with which all surge protection elements are electrically connected. This embodiment has the advantage that fewer components are required, so that the surge protection system can be manufactured more cost-effectively and with smaller dimensions. If the central ignition aid is formed as an "active ignition aid", then preferably, it has multiple ignition electrodes and a central ignition switch connected with the ignition electrodes, whereby each ignition electrode cooperates with a respective surge protection element.<br>
According to a particularly preferred concrete embodiment of the inventive multi-polar surge protection system, all of the surge protection elements, and likewise, all of the ignition aids, are arranged in a common housing, such that the multi-polar surge protection system is combined as a multi-polar surge protection apparatus. In this manner, the individual surge protection elements preferably have a first electrode, a second electrode, and an existing or active air breakdown spark gap arranged between the electrodes, whereby the electrodes of the individual<br><br>
sure protection elements are arranged relative to one another, such that upon ignition of the air breakdown spark gap of one surge protection element, the air breakdown spark gaps of the other surge protection elements are likewise ignited by means of the provided plasma. When, as previously mentioned, the individual surge protection elements have a first electrode and a second electrode, this only means functionally that specifically, for each surge protection element, a first electrode and an individual second electrode need not be provided, rather, one electrode can be provided, which functions for multiple surge protection elements or for all surge protection elements as the second electrode.<br>
With the above described method for safe operation of a multi-polar surge protection system in a multi-phase current supply network, in particularly, in a low voltage network, with which the surge protection system has at least two surge protection elements, which are arranged respective on a line branch of the current supply network, the previously named objected of the present invention is resolved in that upon ignition of an individual surge protection element, all of the other surge protection elements are also ignited.<br>
With a first embodiment of the method, in which the individual surge protection elements each have an ignition aid, upon ignition of an ignition aid of a surge protection element, all other ignition aids of the remaining surge protection elements are also ignited. According to an alternative embodiment of the method, in which the individual surge protection elements are formed as air breakdown spark gaps and are arranged in a common housing, an ignition of the air breakdown spark gapes of the remaining surge protection elements automatically takes place by means of the<br><br>
plasma arising upon, ignition of one air breakdown spark gap of one surge protection element.<br>
In detail, a plurality of possibilities are provided, for designing and further embodying the multi-polar surge protection system or method for safely operating a multi-polar surge protection system of the present invention. In this connection, reference is made on the one hand to the claims depending on claims 1 and 12, and on the other hand, to the subsequent description of the preferred embodiments in connection with the drawings. In the drawings,<br>
Fig. 1 shows two simplified schematic diagrams of a known multi-polar surge protection system known from the state of the art with two different network shapes;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a simplified schematic diagram of a first embodiment of a multi-polar surge protections system of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a simplified schematic diagram of a second embodiment of a multi-polar surge protection system of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a simplified schematic diagram of a third embodiment of a multi-polar surge protection system of the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of a multi-polar surge protection apparatus corresponding to the schematic diagram according to Fig. 4, partially in section......<br><br><br>
Figs, la and lb each show a simplified schematic diagram of a multi-polar surge protection system known from the state of the art for a three-phase current supply network with a total of four surge protection elements 1, whereby the schematic diagram according to Fig. la illustrates a "3 + 1 switching", while Fig. lb symbolized a "4 + 0 switching".<br>
In Figs. 1 through 4, Ll, L2, and L3 designate the active phase conductor of a low voltage network, and N designates the associated neutral conductor. In each line branch 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the low voltage network, a surge protection element 1 is arranged.<br>
With the "3 + 1 switching" according to Fig. la, a corresponding leVel of protection between the individual active phase conductors Ll, L2, L3 and the neutral conductor N, as well as between the neutral conductor N and the ground wire PE, is ensured by the respective surge protection elements 1. With the M + 0 switch" according to Fig. lb, the level of protection on the one hand between the individual active phase conductors Ll, L2, L3 and the ground wire PE and on the other hand, between the neutral conductor N and the ground wire PE, is ensured by means of the individual surge protection elements 1.<br>
From Fig. 2, it can first be recognized that with the multi-polar surge protection system of the present invention, the individual surge protection elements 1 -as known in the state of the art - each have an ignition air 6, whereby according to the present invention, the individual ignition aids 6 are coupled to one another, namely, electrically connected to one another, such that upon ignition of one ignition aid 6, based on a power surge occurring in the corresponding line branch 2, 3, 4, or 5, the other ignition aids 6<br><br><br>
are automatically ignited. Through the switching of the individual ignition aids 6, it is therefore ensured, then, that if one surge acts on the multi-polar surge protection system, all of the surge protection elements<br>
I	ignite, so that a detrimental surge between the<br>
individual line branches 2, 3, 4, 5 cannot take place.<br>
With the multi-polar surge protection system shown in the figures or with the multi-polar surge protection apparatus 7 shown in Fig. 5, in which the individual surge protection elements 1 are arranged in a common housing, the individual surge protection elements 1 each have a first electrode 9, a second electrode 10, and an existing or active air breakdown spark gap between the two electrodes 9, 10. In addition to surge protection elements 1 having an air breakdown spark gap<br>
II	(here only represented), the possibility also exists<br>
basically of using surge protection elements with an<br>
air flashover spark gap, with which, upon activation, a<br>
creepage charge occurs. Based on the large surge<br>
current carrying capacity, preferred surge protection<br>
elements 1 with an air breakdown spark gap 11 are used<br>
for existing multi-polar surge protection systems,<br>
which also are designated as lighting current<br>
conductors.<br>
From Fig. 2, it can be recognized further that the individual ignition aids 6 respectively had an ignition electrode 12 and an ignition switch 13 connected with the ignition electrode 6. In this manner, the individual igniti6n aids 6 are connected to one another such that the individual ignition switches 13 are electrically connected to one another.<br>
In contrast to the embodiment according to Fig. 2, in<br>
which each ignition aid 6 has an ignition electrode 12<br>
as well as an ignition switch 13,  the embodiment<br><br><br>
according to Fig. 3 provided merely a central ignition switch 13'. This central ignition switch 13' is connected with the individual line branches 2, 3, 4, 5 as well as with the individual ignition electrodes 12. Upon activation of a surge protection element 1, the other surge protection elements 1 are simultaneously ignited by the common ignition switch 13'.<br>
In Fig. 4, the schematic diagram of a further improved multi-polar surge protection system is shown, in which not only the individual ignition switches 13 are replaced by a central ignition switch 13', rather, in addition, instead of individual ignition electrodes 12, only a central ignition electrode 12' is provided, so that the multi-polar surge protection system also has a total of only one central ignition aid 6'. With reference to Fig. 4, it is also obvious that the individual surge protection elements 1 each have a first electrode 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, and 9N, which have individual surge protection elements, however, each does not have its own second electrode. Rather, only a "common" second electrode 10PE is provided. In this manner, for example, the air breakdown spark gap 11 of the surge protection element 1 of the line branch 2, that is the active phase conductor L1 is formed by the electrode 9L1 as the first electrode and the electrode 10PE is formed as the second electrode.<br>
In Fig. 5, a concrete embodiment of a multi-polar surge protection system is shown, whereby the individual electrodes 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, 9N, and 10PE, as well as the common ignition electrode 12' are arranged in a hosing 8, so that a total of one multi-polar surge protection apparatus is present. The individual electrodes 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, 9N and 10PE, as well as the common ignition electrode 12' are thereby coaxially arranged to one another and have respectively a circular cross section.<br><br>
Alternatively, the individual electrodes 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, 9N, and 10PE, as well as the common ignition electrode 12' also can have an oval or square cross section. Particularly advantageous is if the individual electrodes 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, 9N, and 10PE, as well as the common ignition electrode 12' have different cross sections over their lengths, so that the electrodes 9L1, 9L2, 9L3, 9N, and 10PE, as well as the ignition electrode 12' are graduated in cross section along their lengths, whereby the region that is to be acting as the air breakdown spark gap 11 can be provided on side in a particular manner.<br>
The inner chamber of the housing 8, which preferably is pressure-sealing and pressure-resistant, has a lining<br>
14,	which, in particular, is made from POM-Teflon. For<br>
a further improvement of the pressure-sealability of<br>
the housing 8, this can be surrounded by an outer<br>
pressure cylinder (not shown here). Finally, it is<br>
shown in Fig. 5 that in the electrode 9N of the neutral<br>
conductor N, a hole 15 is formed. By means of this hole<br>
15,	pressure equalization within the housing 8 is<br>
possible, in which plasma can escape from the region of<br>
the air breakdown spark gap 11 - in Fig. 5, the region<br>
right of the electrode 9N - in which the electrodes 9L1,<br>
9L2, 9L3, 9N, and 10PE, based on the graduated cross<br>
section over their lengths, have a greater distance<br>
from one another.<br><br><br>
