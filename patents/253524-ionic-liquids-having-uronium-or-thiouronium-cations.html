Ionic liquids having uranium or thiouronium cations<br>
The present invention relates to salts containing uranium or thiouronium<br>
cations and various anions, to processes for the preparation of these salts,<br>
and to the use thereof as ionic liquids.<br>
Ionic liquids or liquid salts are ionic species which consist of an organic<br>
cation and a generally inorganic anion. They do not contain neutral mole-<br>
cules and generally have melting points below 373 K. A multiplicity of com-<br>
pounds which are used as ionic liquids are known in the prior art. Thus, sol-<br>
vent-free ionic liquids were disclosed for the first time by Hurley and Wier in<br>
a series of US patents (US 2,446,331, US 2,446,339 and US 2,446,350).<br>
These "room temperature molten salts" were based on AICI3 and a multi-<br>
plicity of n-alkylpyridinium halides.<br>
In recent years, some review articles have been published on this topic<br>
(R. Sheldon "Catalytic reactions in ionic liquids", Chem. Commun., 2001,<br>
2399-2407; M.J. Earle, K.R. Seddon "Ionic liquids. Green solvent for the<br>
future", Pure Appl. Chem., 72 (2000), 1391-1398; P. Wasserscheid, W.<br>
Keim "lonische Flüssigkeiten - neue Lösungen für die Übergangsmetall-<br>
katalyse" [Ionic Liquids - Novel Solutions for Transition-Metal Catalysis],<br>
Angew. Chem., 112 (2000), 3926-3945; T. Welton "Room temperature ionic<br>
liquids. Solvents for synthesis and catalysis", Chem. Rev., 92 (1999), 2071-<br>
2083; R. Hagiwara, Ya. Ito "Room temperature ionic liquids of alkylimidazo-<br>
lium cations and fluoroanions", Journal of fluorine Chem., 105 (2000), 221-<br>
227).<br>
The properties of ionic liquids, for example melting point, thermal and<br>
electrochemical stability, viscosity, are greatly influenced by the nature of<br>
the anion. By contrast, the polarity and hydrophilicity or lipophilicity can be<br>
varied through a suitable choice of the cation/anion pair. There is therefore<br><br>
a demand for novel ionic liquids having varied properties which facilitate<br>
additional possibilities with respect to their use.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide novel stable salt-like com-<br>
pounds having valuable properties which can be used as ionic liquids, and<br>
a process for the preparation thereof. In particular, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide ionic compounds having very stable cations.<br>
This object is achieved by the provision of salts having uranium or thio-<br>
uronium cations in which the positive charge is delocalised over a plurality<br>
of hetero atoms, according to the general formula (1)<br><br>

which may be substituted by alkyl groups having 1-6 C atoms,<br>
and R may also denote hydrogen,<br><br>
where one or more substituents R or R° may be partially or fully substituted<br>
by halogen or partially by CN or NO2, but where halogenation in the<br>
a-position in R° is excluded, and<br>

replaced by atoms and/or atom groups selected from the group -O-, -C(O)-,<br>

Of the particularly preferred anions, the phosphates of the formula<br>
[P(CnF2n+1-mHm)yF6-y]_ have a particular meaning since the choice of this<br>
anion results in salts of the formula (1) of particularly low viscosity.<br><br>

the formula (1) in which the substituents R of the cation denote hydrogen or<br>
a straight-chain or branched alkyl group having 1-12 C atoms, in particular<br>

The present invention secondly relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
the salts having thiouronium or uranium cations of the general formula (1)<br>
according to the invention. To this end, a thiourea C(S)(NR2)2 or a urea<br>
C(O)(NR2)2 is alkylated using an ester AR° or using an oxonium salt<br>
(R°)3O+A-<br>
The groups and substituents R° and R here are defined like those of the<br>
general formula (1) or have a meaning indicated especially. A, in the case<br>
of the reaction with the ester, can be selected from the group [R1CH2OSO3],<br>
[R1SO3], [RFSO3], [RFC(O)O] and [CCI3C(O)O], and A-, in the case of the<br>
reaction with the oxonium salt, can be selected from the group [(FSO2)3C]-<br>
and[BF4]-.<br>
The reaction is is preferably carried out at a temperature at which at least<br>
one of the components is liquid. The reaction is particularly preferably car-<br>
ried out in a temperature range in which the reaction mixture is liquid.<br>
The reaction of the thiourea or urea with an ester or an oxonium salt can be<br>
carried out in polar organic solvents, for example 1,2-dichloroethane or<br><br>
dichloromethane, in nonpolar organic solvents, for example hexane or<br>
pentane, or without solvents, for example in the salt melt. In accordance<br>
with the invention, solvent mixtures can also be used instead of pure sol-<br>
vents.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the reagents can be reacted with a mixing<br>
ratio of up to a five-fold excess of one of the reactants. However, the reac-<br>
tants are preferably employed in equimolar amount.<br>
The salts according to the invention can be isolated with very good yields,<br>
generally above 80%, preferably above 90%.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to an alternative process for the<br>
preparation of a salt according to the invention by means of salt exchange.<br>
In this, a salt having a thiouronium or uranium cation of the general formula<br>
(1) and an anion A- selected from the group [BF4]-, Br-, CI-, I- or [CIO4]- is<br>
reacted with a salt Kt+ A- or with an acid AH, where Kt is an alkali or alka-<br>
line earth metal and A is defined in accordance with the general formula (1).<br>
The reaction is is preferably carried out at a temperature at which at least<br>
one of the components is liquid. The reaction is particularly preferably car-<br>
ried out in a temperature range in which the reaction mixture is liquid.<br>
The salt exchange of the thiouronium or uranium salt can be carried out in<br>
polar solvents, for example water, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, dimethyl-<br>
formamide, methanol or propionitrile, in nonpolar organic solvents, for<br>
example dichloromethane, or without solvents, for example in the salt melt.<br>
In accordance with the invention, solvent mixtures can also be used instead<br>
of pure solvents.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, the reagents can be reacted with a mixing<br>
ratio of up to 10%'excess of one of the reactants. However, the reactants<br>
are preferably employed in equimolar amount.<br>
The salts of the formula (1) according to the invention in which the anion A-<br>
= [RF2P(O)O]- can alternatively be prepared by the reaction of a tris(per-<br>
fluoroalkyl)phosphine oxide with an alcohol and a thiourea C(S)(NR2)2 or a<br>
urea C(O)(NR2)2, where the radicals R are as defined above and are more<br>
strongly basic than the alcohol.<br>
The suitable alcohol is selected so that the desired cation is formed after<br>
the alkylation of the base used.<br>
The tris(perfluoroalkyl)phosphine oxides used can be prepared by conven-<br>
tional methods known to the person skilled in the art. These compounds are<br>
preferably prepared by reaction with hexamethyldisiloxane (V.Ya Sememii<br>
et al, J. Gen. Chem. USSR (Engl. Trans.) 55, No. 12 (1985), 2415-2417).<br>
All compounds according to the invention have a salt-like character, rela-<br>
tively low melting points (usually below 100°C) and can be used as ionic<br>
liquids.<br>
The salts according to the invention can be employed as solvents for many<br>
synthetic or catalytic reactions, for example Friedel-Crafts acylation and<br>
alkylation, Diels-Alder cycloadditions, hydrogenation and oxidation reac-<br>
tions, Heck reactions. Furthermore, it is possible to synthesise, for example,<br>
fluorinated solvents for secondary and primary batteries.<br>
It is also possible to use the compounds according to the invention as non-<br>
aqueous electrolyte, if desired in combination with other electrolytes known<br>
to the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
In addition, the salts according to the invention can be used as non-<br>
aqueous polar substances in suitable reactions as phase-transfer catalyst,<br>
as surfactant (surface-active agent) or as medium for the heterogenisation<br>
of homogeneous catalysts.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications, patents and publica-<br>
tions mentioned above and below is incorporated into this application by<br>
way of reference.<br>
Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art<br>
will be able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The pre-<br>
ferred embodiments and examples should therefore merely be regarded as<br>
descriptive disclosure which is absolutely not limiting in any way.<br>
