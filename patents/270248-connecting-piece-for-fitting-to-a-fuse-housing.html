				<td>Description<br>
Connecting piece for fitting to a fuse housing<br>
Compact gas-insulated switchgear assemblies are used to carry<br>
out switching and protective tasks in the electrical<br>
distribution system in power distribution, particularly at the<br>
medium-voltage level. Particularly in the field of secondary<br>
distribution with relatively low rated currents up to a maximum<br>
of 1250 A and short-circuit currents up to a maximum of 25 kA,<br>
switchgear assemblies are used in a block form which means that<br>
a plurality of switching functions, such as load-break<br>
switches, circuit breakers and transformer outgoers, are<br>
arranged in a single gas container, which is generally filled<br>
with sulfur hexafluoride. These block containers can be<br>
connected by means of a busbar, which is passed out of the gas<br>
container, to form a relatively large switchgear assembly<br>
comprising a plurality of switchboards. Switchboards with a<br>
single switching function can also be connected to one another<br>
by means of a busbar that is passed out. A distinction is<br>
therefore drawn in the case of these switchgear assemblies<br>
between assembly types which can be extended and those which<br>
cannot. In addition to the gas container, these switchgear<br>
assemblies normally comprise the described busbar, an area of<br>
the cable connection and, when using high-voltage/high-power<br>
fuses, a fuse area.<br>
The Siemens NX PLUS C switchgear assembly, for example, uses a<br>
fuse fitting which is located in the cable connection area for<br>
the transformer outgoer. The bushings for connection of the<br>
transformer cable are loceted underneath the fuses.<br>
The present invention relates to a connecting piece having an<br>
electrical conductor for fitting to a housing<br><br>
wall of a fuse housing of an electrical switchgear assembly and<br>
for electrical bushing of the electrical conductor through the<br>
housing wall. A connecting piece such as this is disclosed, for<br>
example, in European Patent Specification EP 0 517 295.<br>
Against the background of a connecting piece such as this, the<br>
invention is based on the object of specifying a connecting<br>
piece of particularly simple design, which provides a high<br>
level of flexibility for installation of the connecting piece<br>
in an electrical switchgear assembly.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a<br>
connecting piece having the features of claim 1. Advantageous<br>
refinements of the connecting piece are specified in dependent<br>
claims.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides that the connecting area on<br>
the housing wall side is designed to be symmetrical such that,<br>
when the connecting piece is being fitted to a housing wall, at<br>
least two different alignments of the connecting piece are<br>
possible by rotation about an axis at right angles to the<br>
housing wall.<br>
One major advantage of the connecting piece according to the<br>
invention is that it allows very flexible fitting of the<br>
connecting piece, to be precise matched to the free space<br>
available in the electrical switchgear assembly. The at least<br>
two different alignment options which are provided according to<br>
the invention for installation of the connecting piece<br>
specifically make it possible to flexibly deviate from an<br>
initially intended installation position for the connecting<br>
piece and to select a different installation position if<br><br>
this different installation position is found to be more<br>
suitable in the specific case.<br>
According to one particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
connecting area on the housing wall side is designed to be<br>
rotationally symmetrical and, when the connecting piece is<br>
being fitted to the housing wall, any desired alignment of the<br>
connecting piece is possiole by rotation about the axis at<br>
right angles to the housing wall. This variant allows even<br>
greater installation flexibility because virtually any number<br>
of positions of the connecting piece relative to the fuse<br>
housing are possible.<br>
A particularly simple and low-cost design is achieved for the<br>
connecting piece if the connecting area has a flange area<br>
composed of electrically ;.nsulating material for an annular<br>
sealing washer to rest on, and if at its conductor end on the<br>
housing wall side, the electrical conductor has a bolt which<br>
projects from the flange area and has an internal or external<br>
thread, for example for holding an attachment screw or<br>
attachment nut.<br>
The bolt is preferably arranged centrally in the flange area<br>
and is of such a size that the annular sealing washer can be<br>
plugged onto the bolt.<br>
The connecting piece preferably has an attachment area between<br>
its connecting area on the housing wall side and its further<br>
connecting area, which attachment area allows the connecting<br>
piece to be attached by an (external) attachment means which is<br>
arranged outside the fuse housing.<br><br>
An attachment area such as this may, for example, have a groove<br>
which is arranged in an annular shape, at least in a ring<br>
section, around the electrical conductor.<br>
By way of example, an attachment ring or attachment ring<br>
segment may be inserted in this groove and its internal ring<br>
area facing the electrical conductor has a curved surface. The<br>
attachment ring or the attachment ring segment is preferably<br>
electrically conductive, and the radius of curvature of the<br>
curved surface in the internal ring area is preferably at least<br>
1 mm. This is because an embodiment of the attachment ring or<br>
segment such as this makes it very simple to achieve electrical<br>
shielding between the electrical conductor of the connecting<br>
piece and the external attachment means, on the other hand. For<br>
example, such shielding makes it possible to avoid the<br>
possibility of an electrical field strength increase in the<br>
area of the groove, causing premature material ageing of the<br>
insulation material; this effect will be explained in more<br>
detail further below ir conjunction with the exemplary<br>
embodiments.<br>
The attachment ring or the attachment ring segment particularly<br>
preferably has a U-shaped cross section, with the bottom area<br>
of the U-shaped cross section facing the electrical conductor,<br>
and with the opening area of the U-shaped cross section facing<br>
away from the electrical conductor.<br>
The connecting piece may also contain an electrode, which forms<br>
a component of a capacit;.ve voltage divider. For example, a<br>
capacitive voltage divider such as this has a conductive ring<br>
electrode and non-conductive connection elements which are<br>
connected to it and are connected to the attachment ring or the<br>
attachment ring segment.<br><br>
The attachment ring or the attachment ring segment preferably<br>
has at least one connecting section with a hole into which one<br>
of the non-conductive connection elements is inserted.<br>
The at least one hole and the non-conductive connection<br>
elements are, for example, encapsulated in an insulation<br>
material of the connecting piece.<br>
The electrode of the capacitive voltage divider is physically<br>
preferably arranged between the groove and the electrical<br>
conductor so that it electrically shields the groove from the<br>
electrical conductor.<br>
The electrical conductor of the connecting piece may, for<br>
example, be straight or may be bent one or more times at any<br>
desired angle.<br>
The invention also relates; to a fuse housing, in particular a<br>
fuse fitting, for an eLectrical switchgear assembly with<br>
connecting bushings, at least one of which is equipped with a<br>
connecting piece as has been described above.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also relates to an electrical<br>
switchgear assembly having a fuse housing, in particular a fuse<br>
fitting, with connecting bushings, at least one of which is<br>
equipped with a connecting piece as described above.<br>
A switchgear assembly such as this preferably has three<br>
connecting bushings specifically a connecting bush on the<br>
outgoer-side, to which a connecting piece - as described<br>
above -<br><br>
is connected, as well as a front and a rear connecting bushing<br>
for connection to an assembly container of the switchgear<br>
assembly.<br>
The front or the rear connecting bushing is preferably<br>
electrically connected to the outgoer-side connecting bushing<br>
by means of a busbar.<br>
By way of example, the front or the rear connecting bushing may<br>
be fitted with a grounding contact of a grounding switch.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for production of a<br>
connecting piece, as has been described above, wherein, in the<br>
case of the method, an acapter piece is fitted to the other<br>
conductor end, facing away from the conductor end on the<br>
housing wall side, of the electrical conductor, and the<br>
electrical conductor together with the adapter piece is<br>
encapsulated with the insulation material of the connecting<br>
piece.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following<br>
text with reference to exemplary embodiments; in this case, by<br>
way of example:<br>
figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of an electrical<br>
switchgear assembly with a fuse fitting and a<br>
connecting piece,<br>
figures 2-5 show a first exemplary embodiment of a<br>
connecting piece according to the invention for<br>
the switchgear assembly as shown in figure 1,<br>
with the ccnnecting piece having a 90° bend and<br>
an attachment ring,<br><br>
figures 6-9 show a second exemplary embodiment of a<br>
connecting piece according to the invention, in<br>
which the electrical conductor of the connecting<br>
piece is not bent,<br>
figures 10-13 show a third exemplary embodiment of a<br>
connecting piece according to the invention, in<br>
which an attachment area is formed by a groove<br>
which is shielded by a capacitive voltage<br>
divider from the electrical conductor of the<br>
connecting piece, and<br>
figures 14-15 show a fourth exemplary embodiment of a<br>
connecting piece according to the invention, in<br>
which an adapter piece is encapsulated in an<br>
encapsulation material of the connecting piece.<br>
For the sake of clarity, the same reference symbols are always<br>
used for identical or comparable components in the figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electrical switchgear assembly 1 having a<br>
fuse housing in the form cf a fuse fitting 2, which is equipped<br>
with a fuse 3. The fuse fitting 2 has three connecting<br>
bushings, specifically an outgoer-side connecting bushing 4, a<br>
front connecting bushing 5 and a rear connecting bushing 6. The<br>
rear connecting bushing 6 is connected to the outgoer-side<br>
connecting bushing 4 by means of a busbar 7.<br>
An assembly container 8 is located above the fuse fitting 2<br>
and, for example, is encapsulated and is filled with a gas,<br>
such as SF6 gas. A<br><br>
cable connecting area 9 is located underneath the fuse fitting<br>
2.<br>
A multiplicity of electrical components are located in or on<br>
the assembly container 8, for example switching elements 10,<br>
10' and 10" as well as further elements such as a mechanical<br>
drive for the switching device, which is arranged outside the<br>
assembly container, a mounting plate 11 for the switching<br>
device, and grounding contacts 14 with a mounting plate.<br>
An electrical connection is made between the components 10,<br>
10', 10", 11, 13 and 14 and the fuse fitting 2 and/or the cable<br>
connecting area 9 via rail systems 15 which are connected via<br>
electrical bushings 20 to the front connecting bushing 5 and to<br>
the rear connecting bushing 6. As can also be seen from figure<br>
1, a switchable connecting 16 within the assembly container 8<br>
can be connected via a switching contact 17 to the rear<br>
connecting bushing 6, in such a way as to allow a connecting<br>
cable to be grounded in the cable connecting area 9, and a<br>
connection of the fuse fitting 2 to be grounded within the<br>
assembly container 8.<br>
Figure 1 also shows a closjre cover 30, which covers the fuse<br>
housing or the fuse fitting 2, and to which the fuse 3 is<br>
fitted.<br>
As can also be seen from figure 1, a connecting piece which can<br>
be mounted "flexibly" is connected to the outgoer-side<br>
connecting bushing 4. Figures 2 to 15 illustrate exemplary<br>
embodiments of the connecting piece 50 which can be mounted<br>
flexibly.<br><br>
Figures 2 to 4 show a first exemplary embodiment of the<br>
connecting piece 50 as shown in figure 1. These figures show an<br>
electrical conductor 60 which has a 90° bend and is<br>
encapsulated in an insulation material 70 of the connecting<br>
piece 50.<br>
The connecting piece 50 has a connecting area 80 on the housing<br>
wall side and a further connecting area 90, which is at a<br>
distance from the connecting area 80 on the housing wall side<br>
and is separated by the 90° bend area.<br>
The connecting area 80 on the housing wall side comprises a<br>
flange area 100 composed cf electrically insulating material,<br>
which is formed by the insulation material 70. The flange area<br>
100 is shaped so as to allow it to rest on an annular sealing<br>
washer 110. A bolt 120 is also provided for fixing the annular<br>
sealing washer 110, which bolt 120 is formed by one end of the<br>
electrical conductor 60 and is arranged at right angles, at<br>
least approximately at right angles, to the surface of the<br>
flange area 100 and thus at right angles, at least<br>
approximately at right angles to the annular sealing washer<br>
110.<br>
The bolt 120 has an internal thread 125 into which an<br>
attachment screw, which is not illustrated in any more detail,<br>
can be screwed. An attachment screw such as this allows the<br>
bolt 120 to be firmly screwed to one housing wall 130 of the<br>
fuse housing 2 of the electrical switchgear assembly 1, which<br>
is not illustrated in any more detail in figure 2.<br>
Specifically, when an attachment screw is screwed into the<br>
internal thread 125, then the bolt 120 in figure 2 is drawn<br>
upwards, as a result of which the flange area 100 of the<br>
connecting piece 50 and the annular sealing washer 110 are<br>
pressed from the outside against the housing wall 130 of the<br>
fuse housing 2, thus<br><br>
producing a sealed joint oetween the connecting piece 50 and<br>
the housing wall 130.<br>
As can be seen in figure 2, the symmetrical arrangement of the<br>
bolt 120 relative to the flange area 100 leads to the housing-<br>
side connecting area 80 being rotationally symmetrical, thus<br>
allowing the connecting piece to be fitted in any desired<br>
alignment to the housing wall 130, specifically because the<br>
connecting piece 50 can be rotated about the rotation axis<br>
which is formed by the bolt 120.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in figure 2, any desired<br>
rotation angle ω is possible between the connecting piece 50<br>
and the housing wall 130. Alternatively, it is also possible to<br>
allow only selected connecting angles co between the connecting<br>
piece 50 and the housing wall 130, for example by means of<br>
appropriate shaping (for example a polygonal cross section:<br>
square, triangular, polygonal) of the bolt 120 and/or of the<br>
housing wall opening into which the bolt 120 is inserted for<br>
fitting.<br>
As can also be seen in figure 2, the annular sealing washer 110<br>
is of such a size that it can be plugged onto the bolt 120. The<br>
internal hole of the sealing washer 110 is preferably of such a<br>
size that it matches the external diameter of the bolt 120 as<br>
well as possible in order to prevent the sealing washer 110<br>
from sliding on the flange area 100.<br>
As can also be seen from figure 2, an attachment area 160,<br>
which has a groove 170, is; arranged between the connecting area<br>
80 on the housing wall side and the further connecting area 90.<br>
An attachment ring 18 0,<br><br>
which is U-shaped when viewed in the form of a cross section,<br>
is inserted or encapsulatec in the groove 170.<br>
The bottom area 190 of the U-shaped attachment ring 180 faces<br>
the electrical conductor 60 of the connecting piece. The bottom<br>
area 190 thus forms an internal annular area with a curved<br>
surface, which encloses the electrical conductor 60 of the<br>
connecting piece 50.<br>
Furthermore, when viewed in the form of a cross section, the<br>
attachment ring 180 has an opening area 200 which faces away<br>
from the electrical conductor 60 and is externally accessible.<br>
An external attachment means 210, for example in the form of a<br>
mounting wall, can be inserted into the opening area 200 of the<br>
attachment ring 180 in orcer to fix the connecting piece 50 in<br>
three dimensions. It is thus possible to attach the connecting<br>
piece outside the area of the housing wall 130 as well, and,<br>
for example, to prevent the possibility of the connecting piece<br>
50 still pivoting about the rotation axis that is formed by the<br>
bolt 120, after the fitting process has been completed.<br>
The attachment ring 180 is preferably composed of an<br>
electrically conductive material in order that the formation of<br>
electrical field lines between the attachment ring 180 and the<br>
electrical conductor 60 during operation of the electrical<br>
conductor is determined exclusively by the shape of the<br>
attachment ring 180, and not by the shape of the edges of the<br>
attachment means 210 may be designed with sharp edges and,<br>
because of this shape, could cause an increase in the<br>
electrical field strength in the attachment area 160 of the<br>
connecting piece. The electrically conductive attachment ring<br>
180 therefore also has the function<br><br>
of shielding the attachment means 210 from the electrical<br>
conductor 60.<br>
The curved surface, facing the electrical conductor 60, of the<br>
internal ring area and the bottom area 190 of the attachment<br>
ring 180 preferably have a radius of curvature of at least 1<br>
mm. A radius of curvature such as this very reliably prevents<br>
the possibility of excessive field-line peaks in the area of<br>
the attachment ring 180, and premature ageing of the insulation<br>
material 70 resulting from an increased field strength.<br>
As can also be seen from figure 2, a capacitive voltage divider<br>
250 is arranged in the connecting piece 50. The capacitive<br>
voltage divider 250 has a conductive ring electrode 260 and<br>
non-conductive connection elements 270 (cf. figure 3) which are<br>
connected to the attachment ring 180. The connection between<br>
the non-conductive connection elements 27 0 and the attachment<br>
ring 180 is not shown in figure 2, and will be explained<br>
further below in conjunction with figure 3.<br>
In addition, the capacitive voltage divider is equipped with an<br>
electrical measurement connection 280 which is connected to the<br>
conductive ring electrode 260 and allows capacitive voltage<br>
measurement of the electrical voltage on the electrical<br>
conductor 60.<br>
In order to allow an electrical connection to the electrical<br>
conductor 60 in the area of the further connecting area 90, the<br>
electrical conductor 60 is in the form of a plug socket 310 at<br>
its other conductor end 3 00 facing way from the conductor end<br>
290 on the housing wall side, in such a way that a plug element<br><br>
can be inserted or screwed into the plug socket from the<br>
outside.<br>
Once again, figure 3 shows, in detail, the individual<br>
components of the connecting piece 50 shown in figure 2. This<br>
shows the electrical conductor 60 with its 90° bend area, which<br>
is indicated schematically by the angle a in figure 3.<br>
Furthermore, figure 3 shows the capacitive voltage divider 250<br>
with its conductive ring electrode 260 and the non-conductive<br>
connection elements 270 connected to it. The non-conductive<br>
connection elements 270 are inserted into holes 350 in the<br>
attachment ring 180. For this purpose, the attachment ring 180<br>
is equipped with three cor.necting sections 360, which are each<br>
provided with a hole 350 in order that in each case one of the<br>
non-conductive three connection elements 270 can be inserted<br>
into this.<br>
The insulation material 70 on the connecting piece 50 is formed<br>
by an encapsulation material, in which the electrical conductor<br>
60 as well as the attachment ring 180 with the capacitive<br>
voltage divider 250 are encapsulated. In order to produce the<br>
connecting piece, the attachment ring 180 and the capacitive<br>
voltage divider 250 are first of all connected to one another<br>
by inserting the three non-conductive connection elements 270<br>
into the three holes 350 in the connecting sections 360 of the<br>
attachment ring 180. In this case, no electrical connection is<br>
made between the attachment ring 180 and the electrically<br>
conductive ring electrode 260, since the connection elements<br>
270 are not themselves Conductive. The plugged-together unit<br>
comprising the attachment ring 180 and the capacitive voltage<br>
divider 250 is then encapsulated together with the electrical<br>
conductor 60, in a casting mold which is not illustrated in any<br>
more detail,<br><br>
with the insulation material or casting material 70, thus<br>
forming the complete connecting piece 50.<br>
Once again, figures 4 and 5 show other illustrations of the<br>
connecting piece 50 as shown in figures 2 and 3. In this case,<br>
figure 4 shows a side view of the connecting piece, and figure<br>
5 shows a three-dimensional view of the connecting piece,<br>
obliquely from the side.<br>
Figures 6 to 9 show a second exemplary embodiment of a<br>
connecting piece 50 as shown in figure 1. This connecting piece<br>
50 differs from the first exemplary embodiment shown in figures<br>
2 to 5 in the shape of the electrical conductor 60. In the<br>
second exemplary embodiment as shown in figures 6 to 9, the<br>
electrical conductor is designed to be straight, and not bent;<br>
otherwise, the technical design of the connecting piece<br>
corresponds essentially tc the first exemplary embodiment: the<br>
connecting piece 50 according to the second exemplary<br>
embodiment is therefore also equipped with a connecting area 80<br>
on the housing wall side, whose flange area 100 is suitable for<br>
resting on an annular sealing washer, which is not illustrated<br>
in any more detail. The conductor end 290 of the electrical<br>
conductor 60 is once again equipped with an internal thread<br>
125, thus allowing screw attachment of the connecting area 80<br>
on the housing wall side to a housing wall of a fuse housing.<br>
An attachment ring 180 is arranged between the connecting area<br>
80 on the housing wall side and the further connecting area 90,<br>
and allows the connecting piece 50 to be attached to attachment<br>
means 210, which are not illustrated in any more detail, for<br>
example a mounting wall.<br><br>
A capacitive voltage divider 250 has a conductive ring<br>
electrode 260 as well as non-conductive connection elements<br>
270, which are plugged into connection sections 360 of an<br>
attachment ring 180 (cf. figure 7). The connection between the<br>
attachment ring 180 and the conductive ring electrode 260 is<br>
illustrated in detail in figure 7, which shows the individual<br>
parts of the connecting p.Lece 50 as shown in figure 6 in more<br>
detail.<br>
The capacitive voltage divider 250 as well as the attachment<br>
ring 180 of the connecting piece 50 as shown in figure 6 may,<br>
for example, be identical to the corresponding parts of the<br>
connecting piece 50 shown in figure 3.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 once again shown different views of the<br>
connecting piece 50 shown in figure 6. Figure 8 shows a side<br>
view of the connecting piece, and figure 9 shows a three-<br>
dimensional view, obliquely from the side.<br>
A third exemplary embodiment of a connecting piece 50 as shown<br>
in figure 1 is shown in figures 10 to 13. In contrast to the<br>
first two exemplary embodiments, this third exemplary<br>
embodiment has no attachment ring 180. Instead of this, the<br>
attachment area 160 is formed solely by the attachment groove<br>
17 0, into which an attachment means 210, for example in the<br>
form of a mounting wall, can be inserted.<br>
If the attachment means 210 were now to be composed of an<br>
electrically conductive material,, then, if the surface of the<br>
attachment means 210 were to have sharply pronounced edges,<br>
this could lead to an increase in the field strength in the<br>
area of the edges of the attachment means 210, to be precise,<br>
also in the air gap 175 which necessarily occurs between the<br>
attachment means 210<br><br>
and the insulation material 70; this is illustrated<br>
schematically by field lines F in figure 10. The electrical<br>
field lines would be formed if a high electrical voltage<br>
relative to the attachment means 210, which is normally at<br>
ground potential, were to be applied to the electrical<br>
conductor 60 of the connecting piece 50.<br>
In order to avoid the formation of field lines F as illustrated<br>
in figure 10, the capacitive voltage divider 250 in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in figure 10 is designed differently<br>
and is also arranged differently, to be precise in such a<br>
manner that a conductive ring electrode 400 of the capacitive<br>
voltage divider 250 is physically arranged between the<br>
electrical conductor 60 and the attachment groove 170 or the<br>
attachment area 160. This arrangement of the electrode 400<br>
results in electrical shielding between the electrical<br>
conductor 60 and the attachment means 210, in such a way that<br>
the field lines F as illustrated in figure 10 do not occur in<br>
this form, specifically because the field lines, stating from<br>
the electrical conductor 6 3, will end at the electrode 400 and<br>
therefore cannot penetrate into the area of the edges of the<br>
attachment means 210, so :hat no field strength increase can<br>
occur either in the air gap 175. That section of the attachment<br>
means 210 which is located in the attachment groove 170 will<br>
therefore remain essentially free of field lines, because of<br>
the positioning of the electrode 400.<br>
Apart from this, that is to say by way of example with respect<br>
to the design of the connecting area 80 on the housing wall<br>
side, the shape of the flange area 100 and the design of the<br>
plug socket 310 in the further connecting area 90, the design<br>
of the connecting piece 50 as shown in figure 10 may, for<br>
example, correspond to the first exemplary embodiment as shown<br>
in figure 2.<br><br>
Figure 11 once again shows the components of the connecting<br>
piece 50 as shown in figure 10, :.n detail. As can be seen, the<br>
electrode 400 has an annular shape and is encapsulated in the<br>
insulation material 70, concentrically around the electrical<br>
conductor. The measurement connection 280, which is connected<br>
to the electrode 400, in order to allow electrical contact to<br>
be made with the electrode 400, can also be seen.<br>
Figure 12 shows the third exemplary embodiment, once again in<br>
the form of a view from the side, and figure 13 shows a three-<br>
dimensional view, obliquely from the side.<br>
A fourth exemplary embodiment of a connecting piece 50 as shown<br>
in figure 1 will now be explained in conjunction with figures<br>
14 and 15. Figure 14 shows a connecting piece which corresponds<br>
essentially to the connecting piece 50 shown in figures 2 and<br>
3. In contrast to this first exemplary embodiment, in the case<br>
of the fourth exemplary embodiment, an adapter piece 420 is<br>
also provided during the encapsulation of the electrical<br>
conductor 60, of the capacitive voltage divider 250 and of the<br>
attachment ring 180 with the encapsulation or insulation<br>
material 70. This adapter piece 420 is plugged or screwed into<br>
the plug socket 310 at the conductor end 300 before said<br>
components 60, 250, 180 and 420 are encapsulated with the<br>
insulation material 70. The leads to the adapter piece 420<br>
being completely integrated in the connecting piece 50.<br>
The purpose of the adapter piece 420 is to allow the plug of<br>
the adapter piece 50 to be matched to other plug standards than<br>
that of the plug socket 310. The adapter piece 420 is therefore<br>
always placed on or inserted into<br><br>
the plug socket 310 durirg the production of the connecting<br>
piece 50 when it is found, even before production of the<br>
connecting piece 50, that a different plug standard will be<br>
used at the user end than that which would be provided by the<br>
plug socket 310 itself. The provision of the adapter piece 420,<br>
as already envisaged during the production of the connecting<br>
piece 50, and the encapsulation of the adapter piece 420 in the<br>
insulation material 70 ensure that a mechanically and<br>
electrically reliable connection is possible for other plug<br>
standards to the connecting piece 50 than would be made<br>
possible just by the plug socket 310 on its own. The provision<br>
of the adapter piece 420 during the production of the<br>
connecting piece itself increases the flexibility and reduces<br>
the costs for matching the connecting piece 50 to connection<br>
standards which are predetermined at the user end.<br>
Figure 15 shows the fourth exemplary embodiment, as shown in<br>
figure 14, with the integrated or encapsulated adapter piece<br>
420, once again in the form of a three-dimensional view<br>
obliquely from the side. As can be seen, the plug connecting<br>
area which is formed by the adapter piece 420 is designed and<br>
shaped differently to that in the case of the plug socket 310<br>
according to the first of the exemplary embodiments, as shown<br>
in figures 2 to 13.<br><br>
