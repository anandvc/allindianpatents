Carbon nanostructures and process for the production of carbon-based<br>
nanotubes, nanofibres and nanostructures<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the economical and continuous production<br>
of carbon-based nanotubes, nanofibres and nanostructures. The invention also<br>
relates to novel carbon nanostructures.<br>
Brief description of the Prior Art<br>
Carbon fibres have long been known and many methods for their production have<br>
been developed, see for example M. S. Dresselhaus, G. Dresselhaus, K. Suglhara;<br>
I. L. Spain, and H. A. Goldberg, Graphite Fibers and Filaments, Springer-Verlag,<br>
new York (1988).<br>
Short (micron) lengths of forms of fullerene fibres have recently been found on<br>
the end of graphite electrodes used to form a carbon arc, see T. W. Ebbesen and P.<br>
M. Ajayan, "Large Scale Synthesis of Carbon Nanotubes." Nature Vol. 358, pp.<br>
220-222 (1992), and M. S. Dresselhaus, "Down the Straight and Narrow," Nature,<br>
Vol. 358, pp. 195-196, (16. Jul. 1992), and references therein. Carbon nanotubes<br>
(also referred to as carbon fibrils) are seamless tubes of graphite sheets with full<br>
fullerene caps which were first discovered as multi-layer concentric tubes or<br>
multi-wall carbon nanotubes and subsequently as single-wall carbon nanotubes in<br>
the presence of transition metal catalysts. Carbon nanotubes have shown promis-<br>
ing applications including nano-scale electronic devices, high strength materials,<br>
electronic field emission, tips for scanning probe microscopy, gas storage.<br>
Presently, there are four main approaches for synthesis of carbon nanotubes.<br>
These include the laser ablation of carbon (Thess, A. et al., Science 273, 483<br>
(1996)), the electric arc discharge of graphite rod (Journet, C. et al., Nature 388,<br>
756 (1997)), the chemical vapour deposition of hydrocarbons (Ivanov, V. et al.,<br>
Chem. Phys. Lett. 223, 329 (1994); Li A. et al., Science 274, 1701 (1996)) and the<br>
solar method (Fields; Clark L et al., US patent 6,077,401).<br>
The production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes by catalytic hydrocarbon cracking<br>
is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,543. The production of single-wall carbon<br>
nanotubes has been described by laser techniques (Rinzler, A. G. et al., Appl.<br>
Phys. A. 67, 29 (1998)), arc techniques (Haffner, J. H. et al., Chem. Phys. Lett.<br>
296, 195(1998)).<br>
Unlike the laser, arc and solar techniques, carbon vapour deposition over transi-<br>
tion metal catalysts has been found to create multi-wall carbon nanotubes as a<br>
main product instead of single-wall carbon nanotubes. However, there has been<br>
some success reported in producing single-wall carbon nanotubes from the cata-<br>
lytic hydrocarbon cracking process. Dai et al. (Dai, H. et al., Chem. Phys. Lett<br>
260, 471 (1996)) demonstrate web-like single-wall carbon nanotubes resulting<br>
from decomposition of carbon monoxide (CO).<br>
In PCT/EP94/00321 a process for the conversion of carbon in a plasma gas is de-<br>
scribed. Fullerenes can be produced by this process.<br>
The availability of these carbon nanotubes in quantities necessary for practical<br>
technology is problematic. Large scale processes for the production of high qual-<br>
ity carbon nanotubes are needed. Furthermore, carbon nanostructures with closely<br>
reproducible shapes and sizes constitute another object of this invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention and improvement we will describe now presents the improvements<br>
of the process necessary for the production of carbon-based nanotubes, nanofibres<br>
and novel nanostructures. According to the present invention, a method for pro-<br>
ducing carbon nanotubes is provided which avoids the defects and disadvantages<br>
of the prior art.<br>
The invention is defined in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are<br>
shown in the dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided a con-<br>
tinuous process for the production of carbon-based nanotubes, nanofibres and<br>
nanostructures. This process involves the following steps preferably in that se-<br>
quence.<br>
A plasma is generated with electrical energy.<br>
A carbon precursor and/or one or more catalysers or catalysts and/or a carrier<br>
plasma gas is introduced into a reaction zone. This reaction zone is in an airtight<br>
high temperature resistant vessel optionally, in some embodiments preferably hav-<br>
ing a thermal insulation lining.<br>
The carbon precursor is vaporized at very high temperatures in this vessel, pref-<br>
erably at a temperature of 4000°C and higher.<br>
The carrier plasma gas, the vaporized carbon precursor and the catalyser are<br>
guided through a nozzle, whose diameter is narrowing in the direction of the<br>
plasma gas flow.<br>
The carrier plasma gas, the carbon precursor vaporized and the catalyser are<br>
guided through the nozzle into a quenching zone for nucleation, growing and<br>
quenching. This quenching zone is operated with flow conditions generated by<br>
aerodynamic and electromagnetic forces, so that no significant recirculation of<br>
feedstocks or products from the quenching zone into the reaction zone occurs.<br>
The gas temperature in the quenching zone is controlled between about 4000°C in<br>
the upper part of this zone and about 50°C in the lower part of this zone.<br>
The carbon-based nanotubes, nanofibres and other nanostructures are extracted<br>
following the quenching. The quenching velocity is preferably controlled between<br>
103 K/s and 106 K/s (K/s degrees Kelvin per second).<br>
Finally, the carbon-based nanotubes, nanofibres and nanostructures are separated<br>

the plasma and/or to quench the products and/or to extract the products com-<br>
prises or consists of one or more of the following gases: Hydrogen, nitrogen,<br>
argon, carbon monoxide, helium or any other pure gas without carbon affinity<br>
and which is preferably oxygen free.<br>
• The gas temperature in the reaction zone is higher than 4000°C.<br>

A yet further embodiment of this invention is a reactor to carry out the process of<br>
this invention. This reactor comprises in open flow communication<br>
A head section comprising<br>
i. at least two, preferably three electrodes<br>
ii. a carbon precursor supply and/or a catalyst supply and/or a gas supply.<br>
- At least one injector for carbon precursor and/or catalyst injection into the<br>
reaction zone,<br>
- a reaction zone designed in size, shape and choice of materials so that the gas<br>
temperature during operation is 4000°C or higher, preferably is well above<br>
4000°C,<br>
- a quenching zone designed in size, shape and choice of materials so that the<br>
gas temperature is controllable between 4000°C in the upper part of this zone<br>
and 50°C in the lower part of this zone,<br>
- a nozzle shaped choke, narrowing the open flow communication direction<br>
between the reaction zone and the quenching zone.<br>
The electrodes are connected to means for creating an electric arc between the<br>
electrodes when a sufficient electric power is supplied. Thereby, an arc zone is<br>
generated into which the gas from the gas supply can be fed to generate a plasma<br>
gas and in which the carbon precursor can be heated at a vaporization temperature<br>
of 4000°C and higher, preferably well above 4000°C.<br>
The reactor in its preferred structure has substantially an interior cylindrical shape.<br>
Typically and preferably the reactor at the surfaces exposed to high temperatures<br>
is from graphite or respectively graphite containing high temperature resistant<br>
material. The reactor in the preferred embodiment comprises a chamber with a<br>
height between 0.5 and 5 m and a diameter between 5 and 150 cm.<br>
In a more specific embodiment the reactor of this invention comprises tempera-<br>
ture control means for the quench zone. These temperature control means are par-<br>
ticularly selected from thermal insulating lining, fluid flow, preferably water flow.<br>
indirect heat exchange means and flow and/or temperature controlled quench gas<br>
injection means.<br>
The nozzle mentioned is in the preferred embodiment a tapering choke followed<br>
by an abruptly expanding section.<br>
In accordance with a yet further embodiment of the invention, there are provided<br>
novel carbon nanostructures. These carbon nanostructures have the shape of a<br>
linear, i.e. essentially un-branched chain of connected and substantially identical<br>
sections of beads, namely spheres or bulb-like units or trumpet shaped units.<br>
These trumpet shaped units form carbon nanostructures the SEM or TEM of<br>
which resembles a necklace-like structure. These novel carbon nanostructures<br>
preferably have diameters of the spherical portions of the spheres or bulb-like<br>
units or respectively of the large end of the trumpet shaped units in the range of<br>
100 to 200 nm. The shapes mentioned are those visible in TEM at very large<br>
magnification and in HRTEM.<br>
The carbon nanostructures of this embodiment of the invention are connected to<br>
fairly long chains and as a rule all of these chains have at least 5 beads connected<br>
to each other. The structures will preferably have 20 to 50 beads in one chain.<br>
In yet another variation of the carbon nanostructures of this invention, these are<br>
filled or at least substantially filled with catalyst metal, more specifically with<br>
nickel or nickel/cobalt. These metal filled nanostructures form an excellent source<br>
of catalyst for the process to produce such nanostructures. Separating these struc-<br>
tures from the product of the quenching zone and introducing the structures back<br>
into the reaction zone is a recirculation of the catalytic material in an encapsulated<br>
and finely divided form. In the reaction zone itself, the carbon and the metal are<br>
both evaporated.<br>
In one embodiment the bulb-like structures of the inventive carbon nanostructures<br>
are connected together at the neck portion.<br>
Preferred applications of these new nanostructures:<br>
The present carbon nanotubes are different in shape when compared to the con-<br>
vential multi-wall nanotubes which exhibit a perfect stacking of graphitic cylin-<br>
ders. In that sense, the described novel structures, in particular such bamboo-<br>
shaped structures have advantages e.g. in gas storage (easier way to store hydro-<br>
gen between the graphitic cones), and also for field emission properties, which are<br>
known to depend on the topology at the nanotube tip apex, and more specifically<br>
to the conical angle (related to the number of pentagons present at the tip apex).<br>
On the other hand, the necklace-like nano-structures have never been reported<br>
before, and they allow in a preferred embodiment the combination in composite<br>
materials both when incorporated into the matrix in an oriented or in a non-<br>
oriented way. A preferred embodiment of the invention is thus a composite com-<br>
prising the necklace-like nano-structures in a matrix, preferably a polymer matrix.<br>
Such nano-objects increase the interaction between the nano-fiber and the host<br>
material, as compared to conventional tubes. They increase the mechanical prop-<br>
erties of composite materials. As the nano-spheres are intrinsically connected, and<br>
can contain metal catalyst, these nano-necklaces can also be used in nano-<br>
electronics.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated, preferred details and combination of de- <br>

ture.<br>

The reactor 1 is designed in a way that it consists of two different but adjacent<br>
zones. Zone A, for the vaporization of the precursor (carbonaceous products and<br>
catalytic products), is maintained at a very high temperature due to the action of a<br>
thermal plasma and an appropriate thermal insulation. Zone B, for the nucleation<br>
and maturation of the carbon-based nanostructures, is kept between 4000°C in the<br>
upper part and less than 50°C in the lower part due to an adequate thermal insula-<br>
tion.<br>
In zone A, the geometry of the internal fittings has the shape of a venturi which is<br>
specifically designed to assure the complete vaporization of the precursors. Each<br>
of the three electrodes 3, of which only two are shown in Figure 1, is connected to<br>
one of the three phases of an electric three-phase generator and supplied with al-<br>
ternative current. After activation of the electric generator and the establishment<br>
of the plasma by the contact of the three electrodes, the electrodes are automati-<br>
cally drawn apart and a plasma flow is established in zone A of the reactor, which<br>
allows the complete vaporization of the precursor. Once the plasma is established,<br>
the control of the electrodes to compensate for their erosion is effectuated auto-<br>
matically. Together with a carrier plasma gas, the carbonaceous product and the<br>
catalytic product are continuously injected into zone A of the reactor, for example<br>
in 4.<br>
The electric power source is of the type "three-phase", whereby the frequency of<br>
the supply can vary between 50 Hz and 10 kHz. Each of the three phases of the<br>
electric source is connected to one of the three electrodes of the reactor. The in-<br>
ventors discovered that an increase of the frequency of the electric supply beyond<br>
50 Hz, which can range from 50 Hz to 10 kHz, achieves particular advantages.<br>
This increase of the frequency allows on the one hand an increase in the stability<br>
of the plasma, and on the other hand a very advantageous increase in the homoge-<br>
neity of the mixture of the plasma gas with the carbonaceous product vaporized<br>
and the catalyst product due to important turbulence phenomena in the flow field<br>
of zone A. This turbulence is caused by the combined effects of arc rotation be-<br>
tween the three electrodes successively changing from anode and cathode with<br>
current frequency and the electromagnetic forces induced by the current in the<br>
electrodes and the arcs themselves.<br>
In zone B of the reactor, the zone of the nucleation and growing of the carbon-<br>
based nanostructures, the temperature of the flow in maintained between 4000°C<br>
in the upper part and less than 50°C in the lower part due to an adequate thermal<br>
insulation. The absolute pressure in zones A and B of the reactor can be between<br>
100 mbar and 30 bar. Into this zone, a certain quantity of cold gas is injected in 5.<br>
allowing the quenching of the aerosols and their extraction from the reactor in 6<br>
by means of an extraction system cooled by a liquid, a gas or any other means of<br>
refrigeration known within the state of the art. Afterwards, the aerosol is trans-<br>
ported to a heat exchanger in 7 where it is cooled down further to a stabilization<br>
temperature of the envisaged carbon-based nanostructures and finally passes<br>
through a separation system in 8 where the carbon-based nanostructures are sepa-<br>
rated from the gas phase. Eventually, the carbon-based nanostructures are taken<br>
out in 10 by means of an airtight valve represented in 9 and the gas is vented in<br>
11.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, full control of the<br>
extraction conditions and the quenching rate is foreseen thereby controlling the<br>
quality of the nanostructures obtained. Both the temperature at which the aerosol<br>
is extracted and the quenching speed of the aerosol are preferably controlled to<br>
ensure high quality products.<br>
Preferred control approaches include the following. The temperature at which the<br>
extraction is effectuated and the residence time for product maturation is con-<br>
trolled by the variation of the axial position of the injection point of cold gas in 5<br>
and the extraction point in 6 in zone B. The quenching velocity rate is controlled<br>
by a variation in the nature and the flow rate of cold gas injected in 5, by the ef-<br>
fectiveness of the extraction system cooled in 6 and by the effectiveness of the<br>
heat exchanger in 7.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Figure 2, zone B of the reactor is modified<br>
by the installation of a recirculation system for the quenching gas flow as de-<br>
scribed hereafter. In zone B of the reactor where the temperature is maintained<br>
between 4000°C in the upper part and less than 50°C in the lower part, a device<br>
cooled by a liquid, a gas or any other means of refrigeration known within the<br>
state of the art is introduced in 5, which allows the extraction of the aerosols in 6<br>
and the transport to a separation system in 7. The temperature of the zone of<br>
which the extraction is effectuated, is controlled by the variation of the axial posi-<br>
tion of the injection point of cold gas in 11 and the extraction point in 5. The<br>
quenching rate is controlled by a variation in the flow rate of cold gas injected<br>
into zone B in 11 by means of a blower 10, by the effectiveness of the extraction<br>
system cooled in 5 and by the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in 6. Therefore,<br>
the gas flow rate in the recirculation circuit is independent of the initial carrier gas<br>
flow entering in 4. The aerosol is transported to a heat exchanger in 6 where it is<br>
cooled down further to a stabilization temperature of the envisaged carbon-based<br>
nanostructures and finally passes through a separation system in 7 where the car-<br>
bon-based nanostructures are separated from the gas phase. Eventually, the car-<br>
bon-based nanostructures are taken out in 9 by means of a valve 8. The excess gas<br>
flow equivalent of the amount of gas entering in 4 is vented in 12.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Figure 3, zone B of the reactor is modified<br>
by the installation of a recirculation system for the quenching gas flow and the<br>
carrier plasma gas supplying the plasma itself as described hereafter. In zone B of<br>
the reactor where the temperature is maintained between 4000°C in the upper part<br>
and less than 50°C in the lower part, a device cooled by a liquid, a gas or any<br>
other means of refrigeration is introduced in 5, which allows the extraction of the<br>
aerosols in 6 and the transport to a separation system 7. The temperature of the<br>
zone of which the extraction is effectuated, is controlled by the variation of the<br>
axial position of the injection point of cold gas in 12 and the extraction point 5.<br>
The quenching rate is controlled by a variation in the flow rate of cold gas in-<br>
jected into zone B in 12 by means of a blower 10, by the effectiveness of the ex-<br>
traction via extraction point5 and by the effectiveness of the heat exchanger 6.<br>
Therefore, the gas flow rate in the recirculation circuit is independent of the initial<br>
carrier gas flow entering in 18. The aerosol is transported to a heat exchanger 6<br>
where it is cooled down further to a stabilization temperature of the envisaged<br>
carbon-based nanostructures and finally passes through a separation system 7<br>
where the carbon-based nanostructures are separated from the gas phase. Eventu-<br>
ally, the carbon-based nanostructures are taken out in 9 by means of a valve 8. A<br>
part of the gas vented in 13 is used as carrier plasma gas in 14. A feeding system<br>
15 with a gas feeding 18 and a valvel6 allows the continuous feeding of solid<br>
carbon material in 4. The excess gas flow equivalent of the amount of gas entering<br>
in 18 is vented in 17.<br>
The raw material used as a precursor consist of one or a combination of the fol-<br>
lowing elements: A carbonaceous product, a catalytic product and/or a gaseous<br>
product. The product used as carbonaceous product can be of solid, liquid or<br>
gaseous nature.<br>
In the case of solid carbonaceous materials, different types of products can be<br>
utilized, for example: Finely milled graphite, acetylene black, carbon black de-<br>
gassed, milled pyrolitic carbon, activated carbon, pyrolized carbon aerogels,<br>
plasma carbon nanostructures. The carbon content of the utilized carbonaceous<br>
material should be as high as possible, preferably higher than 99 weight %. The<br>
average particle size of the carbonaceous materials should be as small as possible,<br>
preferably smaller than 10 µm in diameter, to ensure its complete vaporization<br>
when passing through the plasma.<br>
In the case of liquid and gaseous carbon precursors any kind of hydrocarbon can<br>
be considered.<br>
The catalytic material associated with the carbonaceous material can consist of<br>
one or a mixture of elements well known for their catalytic characteristics in car-<br>
bon nanotubes synthesis, such as: Ni, Co, Y, La, Gd, B, Fe, Cu. The catalytic ma-<br>
terials are introduced in zone A (preferred) or zone B of the reactor, either in form<br>
of a powder mixed with the carbon material, or in form of a deposit on the carbon<br>
material, or in form of a solid whereby the morphology can vary corresponding to<br>
the hydrodynamic prevalent in the reactor, or in the form of a liquid. The mass<br>
ratio of catalyser to carbon can vary between 0.1% and 50%.<br>
In the case of liquid carbon precursors, the catalytic elements are preferably mixed<br>
with the liquid.<br>
In the case of gaseous carbon precursors, the catalytic elements are preferably<br>
introduced in form of a powder.<br>
In the case of solid carbon precursors, the catalytic elements are preferably intro-<br>
duced in form of a deposit on the carbon material.<br>
The plasma gas is preferably a pure gas: Helium, argon, nitrogen or a mixture of<br>
one of these gases with the following gases: Helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, hydrogen.<br>
The quenching gas can be identical to the plasma gas or consist of any kind of gas<br>
mixture.<br>
In the following examples further preferred features, feature combinations and<br>
embodiments of this invention are illustrated.<br>
The examples were carried out in a reactor set-up substantially as shown in Fig-<br>
ures 1 and 2.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The reactor set-up, described in Figure 1, consists of a cylindrical reactor of a<br>
height of 2 meters in stainless steel with water-cooled walls and 400 mm internal<br>
diameter. The upper part of the reactor is fitted with thermal insulation cone-<br>
shaped in graphite of 500 mm height and an internal diameter between 150 and 80<br>
mm. Three electrodes in graphite of 17 mm diameter are positioned through the<br>
head of the reactor by a sliding device system electrically insulated. A central in-<br>
jector of 4 mm internal diameter allows the introduction of the precursor by<br>
means of a carrier plasma gas in the upper part of the reactor. A plasma power<br>
supply, employing a three phase electricity source up to 666 Hz with a maximum<br>
power of 263 kVA, a RMS current range of up to 600 A and a RMS voltage range<br>
of up to 500 V, was used to supply electricity to the three graphite electrodes,<br>
their tips being arranged in the shape of an inversed pyramid.<br>
The carrier plasma gas is helium and the precursor is carbon black with a deposit<br>
of nickel - cobalt corresponding to a weight ratio in relation to the carbon of 2,5<br>
weight % for the nickel and 3 weight % for the cobalt. The gas for the quenching<br>
is helium.<br>
The following table gives the main operating conditions.<br>
More than 98% of the injected precursor mass was removed from the filter. The<br>
recovered product is composed of: 40% of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes,<br>
5.6% of fullerenes whereby 76% of C60 and 24% of C70, 5% of Multi Walled<br>
Carbon Nanotubes, about 20% of fullerene soots, about 30% of undefined carbon<br>
nanostructures with catalyst particles. Quantitative and qualitative measurements<br>
of carbon nanostructures are achieved using Scanning Electronic Microscopy and<br>
Transmission Electronic Microscopy. Quantitative and qualitative measurements<br>
of the fullerenes (C60 and C70) are achieved using UV - visible spectroscopy at<br>
the wavelengths 330 nm and 470 nm after Soxhlet-extraction with toluene.<br>
Example 2<br>
One operates in similar conditions to example 1 but according to the configuration<br>
corresponding to Figure 2. Carrier plasma gas is nitrogen at a flow-rate of 2<br>
Nm3/h. The quenching gas is nitrogen at a flow-rate of 50 Nm3/h. Electrical con-<br>
ditions are 350 A and 200 V. In these conditions necklace shaped carbon nanos-<br>
tructures are produced in very high concentration.<br>
Example 3<br>
One operates in similar conditions to example 1 but according to the configuration<br>
corresponding to Figure 2. Carrier plasma gas is helium at a flow rate of 3 Nm3/h.<br>
The quenching gas is a mixture of nitrogen/helium at a flow rate of 50 Nm3/h.<br>
Electrical conditions are those of example 1. The precursor is ethylene (C2H4)<br>
mixed with nickel-cobalt powders corresponding to a weight ratio in relation to<br>
the carbon of 3 weight % for the nickel and 2 weight % for the cobalt. The recov-<br>
ered product is composed of: 55 weight % of single walled carbon nanotubes, 13<br>
weight % of carbon nanofibres and multi walled carbon nanotubes, the rest of<br>
undefined carbon nanostructures with catalyst particles.<br>
The carbon nanostructures of Fig. 4-9 illustrate embodiments of the invention.<br>
The preferred carbon nanostructures of this invention have the structure of a linear<br>
chain of connected, substantially identical sections of beads, namely spheres or<br>
bulb-like units or trumpet shaped units, preferably having a diameter of the<br>
spheres of the spherical section of the bulb-like units or respectively the large di-<br>
ameter of the trumpet shaped section in the range of 100 to 200 nanometres. All<br>
spheres or bulb-units exhibit nearly the same diameter. These periodic graphitic<br>
nano-fibers are characterized by a repetition of multi-wall carbon spheres ('neck-<br>
lace'-like structure), connected along one direction, and containing frequently a<br>
metal particle encapsulated in their structure. The periodicity of these nanostruc-<br>
tures relates them to the bamboo nanotubes, but they clearly differ by their peri-<br>
odic necklace-like structure and the presence of these metal inclusions.<br>
