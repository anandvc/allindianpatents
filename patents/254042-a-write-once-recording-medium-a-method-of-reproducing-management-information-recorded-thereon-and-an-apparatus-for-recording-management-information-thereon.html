A WRITE-ONCE RECORDING MEDIUM, A METHOD OF REPRODUCING<br>
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION RECORDED THEREON, AND AN APPARATUS<br>
FOR RECORDING MANAGEMENT INFORMATION THEREON<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a write-once optical disc and an apparatus<br>
and method for recording/playing-back management information on/from<br>
the optical disc such as a Write-Once Blu-ray Disc (BD-WO).<br>
Background Art<br>
As an optical recording medium, optical discs on which high-capacity data<br>
can be recorded are widely being used. Among them, a new high-density<br>
optical recording medium (HD-DVD), for example, a Blu-ray disc, has been<br>
recently developed for recording and storing high-definition video data and<br>
high-quality audio data for a long-term period.<br>
The Blu-ray disc involves the next generation HD-DVD technology and is the<br>
next generation optical recording solution, which has an excellent capability<br>
to store data more than existing DVDs. Recently, a technical specification of<br>
an international standard for HD-DVD has been established. Various<br>
standards for Blu-ray discs are being prepared. Particularly the standards<br>
for a write-once Blu-ray disc (BD-WO) are being proposed.<br>
FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the structure of a recording area of a<br><br>
rewritable Blu-ray disc (BD-RE) according to a related art. As shown<br>
in FIG. 1, the disc is divided into a lead-in zone, a data zone and a lead-out<br>
zone allocated in the inner-to-outer radius direction. The data zone is<br>
provided with an inner spare area (ISA) and an outer spare area (OSA)<br>
respectively disposed at the inner and outer radiuses to replace defective<br>
areas, and a user data area provided between the spare areas to record user<br>
data therein.<br>
If a defective area is generated in the user data area while data is recorded<br>
on the rewritable Blu-ray disc (BD-RE), data is transferred from the defective<br>
area to the spare area and is recorded in a portion of the spare area. This<br>
portion of the spare area is known as a replacement area for replacing the<br>
defective area. Additionally, position information related to the defective<br>
area, that is, position information on the defective area and on the<br>
corresponding replacement area is recorded in defect management areas<br>
(DMA1, DMA2, DMA3, and DMA4), which are provided in the lead-in/out<br>
zones, to perform defect management. The BD-RE has a cluster as a<br>
minimal recording-unit. One cluster has a total of 32 sectors, and one sector<br>
has 2048 bytes.<br>
Since rewriting can be performed in any area of the BD-RE, the entire area<br>
of the disc can be randomly used irrespective of a specific recording manner.<br>
Also, since the defect management information can be written, erased and<br>
rewritten in the defect management areas (DMAs), it does not matter that<br><br>
the size of the defect management area is small. In particular, the BD-<br>
RE allocates and uses 32 clusters for each of the defect management areas<br>
(DMAs).<br>
On the other hand, in a write-once disc such as a BD-WO, writing can be<br>
only made once in a specific area of the disc and thus, the manner of<br>
recording is much limited. As such, defect management becomes one of the<br>
important matters when data is to be recorded on a high-density write-once<br>
disc such as a BD-WO. Accordingly, the write-once disc requires a<br>
management area to record therein information on defect management and<br>
on disc management. In this regard, the write-once optical disc requires a<br>
larger management area for recording information on the defect<br>
management and on the disc use state due to its unique Vrite-once'<br>
characteristic.<br>
However, a unified standard satisfying the above requirements is not<br>
available for a write-once disc such as a BD-WO. Further, any standard<br>
related to presently declared write-once optical discs cannot solve the above<br>
drawbacks.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a write-once optical disc,<br>
and an apparatus and method for recording/playing back management<br>
information on/from the optical disc that substantially obviate one or more<br><br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
For description convenience, a write-once optical disc is exemplified as a<br>
write-once Blu-ray disc (BD-WO).<br>
FIGs. 2A and 2B are views illustrating the structure of a write-once optical<br>
disc such as a BD-WO and a method for recording management information<br>
on the disc according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Particularly, FIG. 2A illustrates a single-layer write-once optical disc having<br>
one recording layer according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2B illustrates a dual-layer write-once optical disc having two recording<br>
layers according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2A, the single-layer optical disc includes a lead-in area 30,<br><br>
a data area 32 and a lead-out area 34 in the inner-to-outer radius<br>
direction. The data area 32 includes an inner spare area (ISA) and an outer<br>
spare area (OSA) for replacing defective areas, and a user data area for<br>
recording user data therein. The write-once optical disc also includes a<br>
plurality of temporary disc/defect management areas TDMAs in addition to<br>
a plurality of disc/defect management areas (DMAs). The DMAs (DMA1-<br>
DMA4) are provided in the lead-in and lead-out areas 30 and 34. The<br>
TDMAs store temporarily management information whereas the DMAs store<br>
more permanently the management information. For instance, when the<br>
disc is to be finalized or closed, the management information stored in a<br>
TDMA is transferred to and stored in each of the DMAs. The same<br>
information is repeatedly stored four times using the plurality of DMAs.<br>
Here, two TDMAs are provided on the disc, and are referred to as a TDMA0<br>
and a TDMA1. The TDMA0 having a fixed size (for example, 2048 clusters)<br>
is located in the lead-in area 30, and the TDMA1 having a variable size is<br>
provided in the spare area OSA having a variable size. The TDMA0 should be<br>
necessarily provided on the disc, whereas the TDMA1 is selectively allocated<br>
with various sizes, appropriately. For instance, the size of the TDMA1 can<br>
be ¼ of the size (N*256 clusters) of the OSA such that P = (N*256/4) clusters<br>
where P = size of the TDMA1 and N is a positive integer.<br>
Further, the plurality of TDMAs are used in a specific use sequence. For<br>
instance, it is used in a sequence of the TDMA0 and then the TDMA1.<br><br>
Identification numbers (TDMA0 and TDMA1) are given to the TDMAs in a<br>
serial sequence depending on the use sequence.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, management<br>
information for managing the plurality of TDMAs is recorded at the head of<br>
the TDMA0. This TDMA management information is referred to herein as a<br>
TDMA access indicator (TAI), e.g., element 50 in FIG. 2A. The TAI can also<br>
be referred to as a TLI (TDMA location indicator). The TAJ identifies which<br>
TDMA among all the TDMAs to be used in a specific use sequence/order, is<br>
an "in-use TDMA". An "in-use TDMA" is a TDMA that is currently being<br>
used/accessed or that is currently available for use, among all the TDMAs<br>
having the designated use sequence. The TAI also provides information on<br>
whether or not the disc is currently closed/finalized.<br>
The TAI allows an initial disc access time to be reduced greatly since the TAI<br>
identifies the in-use TDMA and thus, information on the last defect<br>
management and on the disc use state can be quickly obtained from the<br>
identified in-use TDMA. This is beneficial especially when the disc is<br>
initially loaded. Without the TAI, all the TDMAs have to be scanned to<br>
determine which TDMA is the in-use TDMA in order to obtain the necessary<br>
management information from that in-use TDMA.<br>
In the single-layer write-once disc of FIG. 2A, the TAI 50 is provided by first<br>
two head clusters 50a and 50b among the fixed 2048 clusters of the TDMA0.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 2B, the dual-layer writer-once optical<br><br>
disc includes a first recording layer (Layer 0) and a second recording<br>
layer (Layer 1). The first recording layer (Layer 0) includes a lead-in area 40<br>
and an outer zone 0 respectively at the inner and outer radius areas of the<br>
disc. The second recording layer (Layer 1) includes a lead-out area 41 and<br>
an outer zone 1 respectively at the inner and outer radius areas of the disc.<br>
The lead-in and lead-out areas 40 and 41 are known as inner zones.<br>
Further, the disc includes a data area 42 on each of the recoding layers.<br>
The data area of the first recording layer (Layer 0) includes inner and outer<br>
spare areas ISAO and OSAO, and a user data area 43 therebetween. The<br>
user area of the second recording layer (Layer 1) includes inner and outer<br>
spare areas ISA1 and OSA1 and a user data area 44 therebetween. The<br>
ISAO has a fixed size such as 2048 clusters. The ISA1, OSAO and OSA1<br>
have variable sizes. For instance, the size of the ISA1 may be (L*256)<br>
clusters and the size of each of the OSAO and OSA1 may be (N*256) clusters<br>
where L and N are positive integers. The disc also includes a plurality of<br>
DMAs (DMA1-DMA4) in the lead-in area 40, the outer zones 0, 1 and the<br>
lead-out area 41. The same information is repeatedly recorded in the DMAs<br>
for the redundancy purpose.<br>
Furthermore, the disc includes a plurality of TDMAs (TDMA0, TDMA1,<br>
TDMA2, TDMA3 and TDMA4) in addition to the DMAs. The TDMA0 and the<br>
TDMA1 exist in the lead-in and lead-out areas 40 and 41 (inner zones) and<br>
have fixed sizes (e.g., 2048 clusters). The TDMA2, the TDMA3 and the<br><br>
TDMA4 are provided with variable sizes that vary according to the<br>
variable sizes of the corresponding spare areas. For instance, the size of<br>
each of the TDMA2, TDMA3 and TDMA4 can be ¼ of the size of the<br>
corresponding spare area. In one example, the TDMA2 and the TDMA3 each<br>
have the size of P = N*256/4 clusters, and the TDMA4 has the size of Q =<br>
L*256/4 clusters.<br>
Moreover, all the TDMAs are used in a specific use sequence. For instance,<br>
the TDMA0-TDMA4 are used in the sequence of the TDMA0 to TDMA4. This<br>
means, whenever recording is desired to a TDMA, the TDMA0 is first used to<br>
record therein. When the TDMA0 is full, i.e., fully used up, then the TDMA1<br>
is next used to record therein. When the TDMA1 is full, then the TDMA2 is<br>
next used to record therein, and so on. Identification numbers (TDMA0 to<br>
TDMA4) are given to the TDMAs in a serial sequence depending on the use<br>
sequence.<br>
As in the single-layer write-once disc of FIG. 2A, the dual-layer optical disc<br>
of FIG. 2B also includes a TAI 57 at the head area of the TDMA0 preferably<br>
located in the lead-in area 40 of the disc. Generally since more TDMAs are<br>
provided on the dual-layer optical disc compared to the single-layer disc,<br>
providing the TAI on the dual-layer optical disc is of great importance.<br>
In the dual-layer optical disc, the TAI is represented by first five head<br>
clusters 57a-57e among the fixed 2048 clusters of the TDMA0.<br>
FIGs. 3A to 3B are views illustrating the structure of a TAI according to an<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3A illustrates the structure and<br>
use of a TAI in a single-layer write-once optical disc such as a single-layer<br>
BD-WO, and FIG. 3B illustrates the structure and use of a TAI in a dual-<br>
layer write-once optical disc such as a dual-layer BD-WO. The structures of<br>
the TAI as shown in FIGs. 3A and 3B are applicable to the discs shown in<br>
FIGs. 2A and 2B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3A, in the single-layer write-once optical disc, the TAI 50 is<br>
composed of the first two head clusters 50a and 50b of the TDMA0 on the<br>
disc. One of the two TAI clusters 50a and 50b is used as a DMA disc closing<br>
indicator 51 for informing whether or not the optical disc is finalized/closed,<br>
and the other one of the two TAI clusters 50a and 50b cluster is used as a<br>
TDMA1 in-use indicator 52 for indicating whether or not the TDMA1 is the<br>
in-use TDMA. In this example, the first head cluster 50a of the TAI 50<br>
functions as the DMA disc closing indicator 51, and the second head cluster<br>
50b functions as the TDMA1 in-use indicator. However, this allocated order<br>
can be switched as needed.<br>
The TDMA1 in-use indicator 52 indicates directly whether or not the<br>
corresponding TDMA1 is the in-use TDMA. This indication is implemented<br>
by providing certain recording in the second cluster 50b of the TAI 50. If the<br>
TAI cluster 50b has this certain recording therein, then the TAI cluster 50b<br>
is said to be in the 'recorded state'. If the TAI cluster 50b does not have this<br>
certain recording therein, then the TAI cluster 50b is said to be not in the<br><br>
recorded state. If the TAI cluster 50b (the TDMA1 in-use indicator 52)<br>
is not in the recorded state, it means that the firstly used TDMA0 is the in-<br>
use-TDMA. If the TAI cluster 50b is in the recorded state, it means that the<br>
next TDMA1 is the in-use-TDMA, which means the firstly used TDMA0 is<br>
full, i.e., fully used up, so that there is no recording space in the TDMA0.<br>
Accordingly, by examining the recorded/unrecorded state of the TAI cluster<br>
50b, a recording/reproducing apparatus can identify quickly which TDMA<br>
can and should be currently used during a data recording operation of the<br>
disc. This reduces the disc access time greatly and provides an efficient and<br>
effective way to carry data recording operations of the disc.<br>
The DMA disc closing indicator 51 functions to inform whether or not the<br>
write-once optical disc is closed/finalized. This can be realized by recording<br>
certain data in the first cluster 50a of the TAI. If there is such recording in<br>
the first TAI cluster 50a, then the first TAI cluster 50a is said to be in the<br>
recorded state and the recorded state of the first TAJ cluster 50a means the<br>
disc is finalized/closed. If there is no such recording in the first TAI cluster<br>
50a, then the first TAI cluster 50a is said to be not in the recorded state,<br>
which in turn means the disc is not yet finalized/closed.<br>
A user or host can request the disc to be closed, or the closing of the disc<br>
can be triggered automatically if there is no user data area or management<br>
data area to record user data/management data therein. Once the disc is<br>
closed, the disc is essentially in a read-only state, thereby making it<br><br>
impossible to record user data subsequently. The closing of the disc<br>
is also referred to as finalizing the disc or disc finalization.<br>
If the disc is to be closed as described above, the optical recording/playback<br>
apparatus transfers and records the latest management information from<br>
the latest TDMA into each of the DMAs. At this time, the first TAI cluster<br>
50a (DMA disc closing indicator cluster 51) is recorded with data (e.g.,<br>
dummy data or some other data) to be placed in the recorded state. The<br>
recorded state of the first TAI cluster 50a indicates that the disc is closed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3C, if none of the TAI clusters 50a and 50b are in the<br>
recorded state, it means that the in-use-TDMA is the TDMA0 as the first<br>
TDMA and the disc is not closed.<br>
Placing the TAI clusters 50a and 50b in the recorded state is done by<br>
recording the TAI clusters 50a and 50b with some data. This can be realized<br>
by recording the TAI clusters 50a and 50b with high frequency signals,<br>
dummy data, or real data (meaningful data). For instance, the latest<br>
temporary disc definition structure (TDDS) information of the corresponding<br>
TDMA can be recorded into the corresponding TAI cluster as an example of<br>
using real data to place the TAI cluster in the recorded state. Examples of<br>
recording such real data in the TAI clusters will be described later reference<br>
to FIGs. 6A and 6B.<br>
Accordingly, the TAI includes the disc closing information as well as<br>
information on the in-use-TDMA among the TDM As.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the dual-layer<br>
disc can have up to five TDMAs (TDMA0-TDMA4). Then the TAI for such a<br>
disc is composed of the first five head clusters of the TDMA0, where the first<br>
head cluster of the TDMA0 functions as the DMA disc closing indicator and<br>
the next four head clusters (second to fifth clusters) of the TDMA0 function<br>
as the TDMA in-use indicators. The second to fifth clusters of the TDMA0<br>
correspond respectively to the TDMA1-TDMA4 such that they function as<br>
the TDMA1-TDMA4 in-use indicators, respectively. Each of these TDMA in-<br>
use indicators, as discussed in connection with FIG. 3A, indicates whether<br>
or not the corresponding TDMA is the in-use TDMA.<br>
FIG. 3B illustrates an example of the structure of a TAI 57 for the dual-layer<br>
write-once disc of FIG. 2B according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 3B, the TAI 57 is composed of first to fifth head<br>
clusters 57a-57e of the TDMA0. The first TAI cluster 57a functions as a<br>
DMA disc closing indicator 51. The second to fifth TAI clusters 57b-57e<br>
function respectively as TDMA4-TDMA1 in-use indicators 55-52. As such,<br>
the second to fifth TAI clusters 57b-57e are used in the order of decreasing<br>
address, which is indicated by the 'recording direction' arrow. That is,<br>
recording in the TAI clusters 57b-57e occurs sequentially from the cluster<br>
57e to the cluster 57b. However, these clusters can be used in the reverse<br>
direction.<br>
If none of the second to fifth TAI clusters 57b-57e are in the recorded state,<br><br>
it means that the firstly used TDMA0 is the in-use-TDMA. If the fifth TAI<br>
cluster 57e (TDMA1 in-use indicator 52) alone is in the recorded state, it<br>
means that the TDMA0 is full and the TDMA1 is the in-use-TDMA. If only<br>
the fifth and fourth TAI clusters 57e and 57d are in the recorded state, it<br>
means that the TDMA0 and TDMA1 are full and the TDMA2 is the in-use-<br>
TDMA. This is illustrated in FIG. 3D. The rest of the in-use indicator<br>
clusters are used in the similar manner.<br>
If all the clusters 57a-57e of the TAI 57 are in the recorded state as shown in<br>
FIG. 3E, it means that the current disc is closed, and no data can now be<br>
recorded on any area of the disc. Thus, only a reproduction of the disc may<br>
be allowed.<br>
FIGs. 4A to 4C are views illustrating the structure of a TAI according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4A illustrates the<br>
structure and use of a TAI in a single-layer write-once optical disc such as a<br>
single-layer BD-WO, and FIGs. 4B and 4C illustrate the structure and use of<br>
a TAI in a dual-layer write-once optical disc such as a dual-layer BD-WO.<br>
The structures of the TAI as shown in FIGs. 4A-4C are applicable to the<br>
discs and TAI (57) shown in FIGs. 2A and 2B.<br>
In this embodiment, the TAI indicates which TDMA is the in-use TDMA by<br>
indicating which TDMA(s) are full. In the example of FIGs. 4A-4C, assume<br>
that the TDMAs are used sequentially from the TDMA0 to the TDMA1<br>
(single-layer disc), or to the TDMA4 (dual-layer disc) as discussed above.<br><br>
Also the TAI is used in a sequence starting from the TAI cluster having<br>
a low PSN to the TAI cluster having a high PSN.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, in the example of the single-layer disc, two clusters<br>
172a and 172b are allocated for a TAI 172. The first and second TAI clusters<br>
172a and 172b function respectively as a TDMA0 full indicator 173 and a<br>
TDMA1 full indicator 174. Accordingly, if only the TDMA0 is full, the first<br>
TAI cluster 172a (TDMA0 full indicator 173) alone is indicated as being in<br>
the recorded state. This means that the TDMA1 is the in-use TDMA and can<br>
be used. If the first TAI cluster 172a is not in the recorded state, it means<br>
that the TDMA0 is not yet full and is available for use. That is, the TDMA0 is<br>
the in-use TDMA and can be used. If both the first and second TAI clusters<br>
172a and 172a are in the recorded state, then the TDMA0 and TDMA1 are<br>
all full, which means there is no TDMA available for recording management<br>
information and the disc is closed /finalized.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4B, in the dual-layers write-once disc, first through fifth<br>
clusters 175a-175e are allocated for a TAI 175 and are recorded sequentially<br>
in that order in this example. The first to fifth cluster 175a-175e correspond<br>
to the TDMA0 to TDMA4, respectively, and function as TDMA0-TMDA4 full<br>
indicators 176-180, respectively. Each TAI cluster indicates whether or not<br>
the corresponding TDMA if full.<br>
Accordingly, for instance, If no TAI cluster is in the recorded state, it means<br>
that the TDMA0 is the in-use TDMA. If only the first TAI cluster 175a is in<br><br>
the recorded state, it means that the TDMA0 is full and the in-use-TDMA<br>
is the TDMA1. If only the first and second TAI clusters 175a and 175b are in<br>
the recorded state, it means that the TDMA0 and TDMA1 are fully used and<br>
the TDMA2 is currently available for use. If all five TAI clusters 175a-175e<br>
are in the recorded state as shown in FIG. 4C, it means that the TDMA0 to<br>
the TDMA4 are all fully used up and there is no usable TDMA. In this case,<br>
since the corresponding disc has no area for recording the TDMS<br>
information therein, the disc is finalized/ closed.<br>
In the embodiment of FIGs. 4A-4C, the TDMA full indicators of the TAI can<br>
be used to determine whether or not the disc is finalized/closed and thus<br>
can function also as the disc closing indicator. For instance, if the TAI<br>
cluster 174 (TDMA1 full indicator) in the example of FIG. 4A is in the<br>
recorded state, it means that the disc is closed/finalized. In the example of<br>
FIG. 4C, if the TAI cluster 180 (TDMA4 full indicator) is in the recorded state,<br>
it means that the disc is closed/finalized.<br>
According to the embodiments of the present invention, the TAI clusters<br>
shown in FIGs 3A-4C can be used sequentially in the order of decreasing<br>
address or increasing address. However, it may be desirable that the<br>
recording of the TAI clusters is performed in a sequence starting from the<br>
cluster having a high PSN (Physical Sector Number) to the cluster having a<br>
lower PSN, as shown in FIG. 3B. This prevents interference with an OPC<br>
(Optimum Power Calibration, not shown) disposed in the inner radius<br><br>
direction adjacently to the TDMA0.<br>
According to the present invention, since the recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus checks for a recorded state within the TAI to determine the<br>
location of the in-use-TDMA if the disc is loaded, the recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus can quickly move to a start location of the in-use-TDMA to read<br>
the lastly recorded TDMS (temporary disc management structure)<br>
information therefrom, thereby initially obtaining a variety of initialization<br>
information for playback.	However, if there is no TAI, the<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus has to scan all TDMAs beginning from the<br>
TDMA0 to search for an available TDMA. This is a drawback because a long<br>
disc access time is needed for initial playback. Thus the present invention<br>
solves the above drawback effectively by providing and using the TAI.<br>
Moreover, the DMA disc closing indicator of the TAI quickly indicates<br>
whether or not any recording can be made to the disc.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, if the single-layer<br>
write-once disc has more than two TDMAs or if the dual-layer write-once<br>
disc has a certain number of TDMAs, then the total number of TAI clusters<br>
present in the TAI as the TDMA in-use indicators changes according to the<br>
total number of TDMAs present on the disc. For instance, if there is an X<br>
number of TDMAs on the disc, then there is an (X-l) number of TAI clusters<br>
that function as the TDMA in-use indicators. Each of such TAI clusters<br>
would correspond to one of the TDMAs, generally excluding the first TDMA<br><br>
(TDMA0), in the order of the TDMA use sequence.<br>
The TAI 50, 57, 172, 175 is located at the head of the TDMA0 located in the<br>
lead-in area of the single layer or dual-layer disc as shown in FIGs. 2A and<br>
2B. However, any location of the TAI on the disc is acceptable if it is located<br>
within an area which a recording/reproducing apparatus can initially<br>
recognize as the management area. In this regard, the data area of the disc<br>
may be excluded. For instance, the TAI can alternatively be provided at the<br>
end portion of the TDMA0. As another alternative, the TAI can be provided<br>
within one, some or each of the DMAs of the single-layer/dual-layer write-<br>
once disc.<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates a variety of information on the disc defect management<br>
and on the disc use state, where this information is recorded in the TDMAs.<br>
Whenever recording is performed on the disc, the recording is generally<br>
performed by more than one cluster, a cluster being generally a minimal<br>
recording-unit. Various disc management information recorded in the<br>
TDMA (e.g., TDMO, TDMA1, TDMA2, TDMA3, or TDMA4) is collectively<br>
referred to herein as TDMS (temporary disc management structure)<br>
information. The TDMS information can be changed or added depending on<br>
a standard.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5A, the TDMS information includes, but is not limited to, a<br>
Temporary Defect List (TDFL) for recording disc defect management<br>
information, a Sequential Recording Range Information (SRRI) applied in a<br><br>
sequential recording mode as information for representing the disc<br>
use state, a Space-Bit Map (SBM) applied in a random recording mode, and<br>
a Temporary Disc Definition Structure (TDDS) information including recent<br>
location information of the TDFL and the SRRI (or SBM). The SRRI and the<br>
SBM may not be concurrently used, and either the SRRI or SBM is recorded<br>
on the disc depending on the recording mode.<br>
As an example, in the context of the disc structure shown in FIGs. 2A and<br>
2B, each of the TDMA0 ~ TDMA4 includes one or more TDFLs/SBMs/SRRIs<br>
each recorded with a TDDS in one cluster at each recording/updating time,<br>
as shown in FIG. 5A. That is, each recording of a TDFL/SBM/ SRRI with a<br>
TDDS is allotted one cluster. Generally, the last sector of each such cluster<br>
is designated to store therein the TDDS information as shown in FIG. 5A.<br>
However, the first sector, instead of the last sector, of each such cluster can<br>
also be used to store the TDDS information.<br>
The TDDS information includes general disc record/playback information,<br>
and is generally always checked at the time of loading the disc in the<br>
record/playback apparatus since it includes pointer information for<br>
indicating the recent locations of the TDFL and the SRRI (or SBM) as<br>
described above. According to the disc use state, the TDDS information is<br>
continuously updated and the updated TDDS information is written in the<br>
TDMA at each update/recording time. Thus, the last TDDS in the latest<br>
TDMA used should be checked to access a variety of management<br><br>
information on a current disc use state.<br>
FIG. 5B is a view illustrating the structure of a TDDS according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This structure can be applied to any<br>
disc structure having a TDDS therein. Referring to FIG. 5B, a variety of<br>
information recorded in the TDDS includes, but is not limited to: a TDDS<br>
identifier" field 61 and a "TDDS format" field 62 for distinguishing a property<br>
of the TDDS; a "TDDS Update Count" field 63 for indicating update times of<br>
the TDDS; a "first PSN of Drive Area" field 64 for recording a variety of drive<br>
information; a "first PSN of Defect List" field 65 for indicating a first physical<br>
sector number of the defect list in case where the disc is closed; a "Location<br>
of LSN 0 of User Data Area" field 66 (LSN = last sector number) and a "last<br>
LSN of User Data Area" field 67 for indicating a start and an end of the user<br>
data area; an "Inner Spare Area 0 size" field 68, an "Outer Spare Area size"<br>
field 69 and an "Inner Spare Area 1 size" field 70 for indicating the size of<br>
the corresponding spare area; a "Spare Area Full flags" field 71 for<br>
selectively indicating whether or not the spare areas are fully used (full); a<br>
"Recording Mode" field 72 for indicating a disc recording mode such as a<br>
sequential recording mode or a random recording mode; a "general flag bits"<br>
field 73 for indicating whether or not the write-protection of the disc exists;<br>
an "Inconsistency flags" field 74 for indicating an update state of the TDMS<br>
information; a "Last Recorded Address of User Data Area" field 75 for<br>
indicating a location of the last recorded user data within the user data<br><br>
area; a "Size of TDMAs in Outer Spare Area" field 76 and a "Size of<br>
TDMS in Inner Spare Area 1" field 77 for indicating the size of the<br>
corresponding TDMA allocated within the spare area; a "First PSN of 1st<br>
Cluster of Defect List" field 78 for indicating a first physical sector number of<br>
the latest defect list in the latest TDMA area to a "first PSN of 8th Cluster of<br>
Defect List" field 79 for indicating the 8th physical sector number (Defect list<br>
generally does not exceed four clusters in the single-layer optical disc and<br>
eight clusters in the dual-layer optical disc); a "first PSN of SRRI/SBM for<br>
LO" field 80 and a "first PSN of SBM for LI" field 81 for indicating the<br>
location of the SRRI (or SBM), which is finally recorded in a sequential or<br>
random recording mode; a "next available PSN of ISAO" field 82, a "next<br>
available PSN of OSA0" field 83, a "next available PSN of ISA1" field 84, a<br>
"next available PSN of OSA1" field 85 for indicating a next available physical<br>
sector number in the corresponding spare area; and a "Year/Month/Data of<br>
recording" field 86 for indicating a recording time, and a "Drive ID" field 87<br>
for indicating a manufacture company, an additional identification, a serial<br>
number and the like.<br>
Some of these fields of the TDDS can be non-variable fields (not updated).<br>
Such fields may include the "TDDS identifier" field 61, the "Inner Spare Area<br>
0, 1 size" fields 68-70, the "Outer Spare Area size" field 69, the "Recording<br>
Mode" field 72, the "Size of TDMAs in Outer Spare Area" field 76, the "Size of<br>
TDMAs in Inner Spare Area 1" field 77 among the TDDS information<br><br>
discussed above. For description convenience, information included in<br>
these non-variable fields is called "fixed management field" information.<br>
Since the fixed management field information is the same no matter which<br>
TDDS is played-back, the entire structure of the disc, the recording manner<br>
and the like can be determined through this information.<br>
Further, some of the fields of the TDDS may need to be continuously<br>
updated according to a need. Such fields may include the "first PSN of 1st<br>
Cluster of Defect List" ... "first PSN Of 8th Cluster of Defect List" field 78...79,<br>
the "next available PSN of ISAO" field 82, the "next available PSN of OSAO"<br>
field 83, the "next available PSN of ISA1" field 84, and the "next available<br>
PSN of OSA1" field 85. For description convenience, information included in<br>
these variable fields is called "variable management field" information.**<br>
Accordingly, if the TDDS information is recorded in the TAI and is played-<br>
back according to an embodiment of the present invention, the entire disc<br>
structure, the recording manner/mode and the like can be firstly<br>
determined through the fixed management field information. For instance, a<br>
corresponding TDMA is easily accessed through the size information of the<br>
TDMA area included in the fixed management field information.<br>
FIGs. 6A and 6B illustrate two examples of different contents of the TAI<br>
cluster according to an embodiment of the present invention. Although FIGs.<br>
6A and 6B show one TAI cluster, each cluster of the TAI discussed herein<br>
can have the same or similar content structure.<br><br>
Particularly, FIGs. 6A and 6B are examples of recording certain real<br>
data into the TAI clusters to selectively place the TAI clusters into the<br>
recorded state. Some or all of such real data recorded in the TAI can be<br>
directly used to indicate whether or not the TAI cluster(s) is in the recorded<br>
state so as to identify the in-use TDMA as discussed above. The use of such<br>
real data has an advantage in that additional relevant information can be<br>
provided by the TAI in addition to the indication of the current in-use TDMA.<br>
It should be noted, however, that dummy data or any other designated<br>
signals can be recorded into the TAI clusters to indicate the<br>
recorded/unrecorded state of the TAI clusters. The TAI content structures<br>
of FIGs. 6A and 6B are applicable to the TAI and disc structures shown in<br>
FIGs. 2A-5B and the methods of FIG. 8.<br>
According to one example as shown in FIG. 6A, the TAI cluster, which<br>
corresponds to a particular TDMA (or latest TDMA in case that the TAI<br>
cluster indicates the disc closing) as discussed above, includes the latest<br>
TDDS information associated with the TDMA corresponding to the TAI<br>
cluster, in addition to the information indicating whether the corresponding<br>
TDMA is the in-use TDMA. In case where the last TDDS is recorded in the<br>
last cluster of each TDMA, the TDMA including the latest TDDS and the in-<br>
use-TDMA can be different from each other, which in turn can cause errors<br>
when accessing the disc. By providing the additional information in the TAI<br>
as in FIG. 6A, such an error can be prevented.<br><br>
A detailed description of this situation is as follows by referring to<br>
FIG. 6A. First, assume that the TAI is recorded in cluster units, a cluster<br>
being the minimal recording-unit. In the first sector (Sector 0) of the TAI<br>
cluster having 32 sectors, there exist an identification field 92 ("TAI<br>
identifier") for allowing the recognition of the TAI information, a TAI format<br>
information field 93 ("TAI format") related with a version of the current disc,<br>
and a TAI update count field 94 ("TAI update count") for increasing a count<br>
value by 1 whenever the TAI is updated. The update count field 94 can also<br>
be used even as the information for indicating how many clusters may be<br>
present within the TAI. Further, there exists a TDDS location field 95<br>
("Latest TDDS location") for providing information on the TDMA in which the<br>
latest TDDS information is located.<br>
The remaining area 96 of the first sector (Sector 0) of the TAI cluster is used<br>
to indicate the recorded or unrecorded state of the TAI cluster by using a<br>
predetermined value (for example, setting the field to "OOh"). For instance, if<br>
the remaining area 96 of Sector 0 of the TAI cluster has certain designated<br>
recording as discussed above, then the TAI cluster is said to be in the<br>
recorded state to indicate the in-use status of the corresponding TDMA or<br>
the disc closing as discussed above in connection with FIGs. 3A-4C.<br>
The TDDS location field 95 in the first sector (Sector 0) of the TAI cluster<br>
identifies a TDMA in which the latest TDDS information is recorded<br>
irrespective of whether or not that TDMA is fully used up. For example, the<br><br>
values of this field 95 can be defined so that "0000 0000b" means the<br>
latest TDDS exists in the TDMA0, "0000 0001b" means the latest TDDS<br>
exists in the TDMA2, "0000 0011b" means the latest TDDS exists in the<br>
TDMA3, and "0000 0100b" means the latest TDDS exists in the TDMA4.<br>
Other examples are possible. Accordingly, in the example of FIG. 3C, if the<br>
second cluster 50b of the TAI 50 alone is in the recorded state (e.g., the area<br>
96 of the TAI cluster 50b in FIG. 3C is in the recorded state) and the TDDS<br>
location field 95 (i.e., of the second TAI cluster 50b in FIG. 3C) has a value of<br>
"0000 0000b", it means the usable TDMA is the TDMA1, but the last<br>
updated TDDS (latest TDDS information) is located within the TDMA0 on<br>
the disc.<br>
In addition, the latest TDDS information is recorded into a TDDS<br>
information field 97 ("Latest TDDS") of the second sector (Sector 1 of the TAI<br>
cluster). As a result, the TAI can be utilized even for recovering the latest<br>
TDDS information directly. This is advantageous since, even if the latest<br>
TDDS information recorded in the latest TDMA as part of the TDMS<br>
information is damaged, the important TDDS information will not be lost<br>
since it can recovered from the TAI recorded in the TDMA0. Some or all of<br>
the remaining sectors (98) of the TAI cluster can have a copy of the latest<br>
TDDS information stored in the TDDS information field 97. Each TDDS<br>
information is recorded in one sector size. Thus, for instance, if 3 sectors of<br>
the TAI cluster are each recorded with the same latest TDDS information,<br><br>
this means that the latest TDDS information is stored three times in<br>
the TAI.<br>
The latest TDDS information stored in the field 97 of the TAI cluster can be<br>
the last TDDS information or the first TDDS information. For instance, if<br>
the TDMA corresponding to the TAI cluster becomes the in-use TDMA, then<br>
recording in the field 96 is made to indicate that the corresponding TDMA is<br>
currently in use. At this time, the first TDDS information recorded in the<br>
corresponding TDMA is copied and recorded into the TDDS information field<br>
97 of the TAI cluster as the latest TDDS information. The first TDDS<br>
information is recorded in the field 97 because the corresponding TDMA is<br>
still in use and is not full at that time. Thus, according to a time point when<br>
the TAI is updated, the latest TDDS information recorded in the TAI can be<br>
the last TDDS recorded within the corresponding TDMA (e.g., when the<br>
corresponding TDMA is full), or can be the first TDDS recorded within the<br>
in-use-TDMA (i.e., when the corresponding TDMA is currently available for<br>
use).<br>
As another example, the latest TDDS information can be copied up to 32<br>
times into the TAI cluster. Any remaining sector of the TAI cluster can be<br>
set to a certain value such as OOh if it is not used. Since each TDDS<br>
information recording is allotted with one sector size, this means the entire<br>
TAI cluster can be recorded with the same latest TDDS information up to 32<br>
times as shown in FIG. 6B. In this example, the first TDDS information<br><br>
recorded in the corresponding TDMA is recorded 32 times in the TAI<br>
cluster. And the recording of the first TDDS information in the TAI cluster is<br>
directly used as the TDMA in-use/disc closing indicator of the TAI cluster.<br>
This is an example of using the recording of real data (such as the TDDS<br>
information) in the TAI cluster to selectively indicate whether or not the TAI<br>
cluster is in the recorded state. Thus, the TAI cluster, not only indicates<br>
which TDMA is the in-use TDMA or whether or not the disc is closed, but<br>
also provides the latest TDDS information associated with the corresponding<br>
TDMA.<br>
Accordingly, the optical recording/playing-back apparatus can examine the<br>
TAI from the loaded disc to determine whether or not the disc is closed. If<br>
the disc is closed, the last TDDS information of the disc can be obtained by<br>
reading the latest TDDS information recorded in the TAI cluster. Further,<br>
the TAI can be examined to identify the location of the in-use TDMA since it<br>
indicates which TDMA is currently the in-use TDMA. Further, by accessing<br>
and using the "fixed management field" information within the TDDS<br>
information recorded in the corresponding TAI cluster, the spare areas can<br>
be allocated or not allocated on the disc, and the allocation size of the spare<br>
areas and/or TDM As may be obtained.<br>
After that, the recording/playing-back apparatus can move a pickup to the<br>
in-use-TDMA area to perform the scan from the beginning of the<br>
corresponding TDMA area, thereby confirming the last recorded TDDS.<br><br>
Therefore, the "variable management field" information recorded in the<br>
TDDS can be confirmed and the confirmed information can be used to allow<br>
the reading of the last TDFL, SRRI (or SBM), thereby reading information on<br>
the entire disc recording state and defect areas.<br>
Hereinafter, the optical recording and playback method and apparatus using<br>
the TAI according to an embodiment of the present invention is discussed.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a recording/reproducing apparatus according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The methods of the present invention<br>
can be implemented by the apparatus of FIG. 7 or other suitable<br>
device/system. The recording/reproducing apparatus includes a<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10 for performing reproduction and/or recording<br>
from/on an optical disc, and a control unit (or host) 20 for controlling the<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10. The control unit 20 sends a record<br>
command or a reproduce command for a specific area on the disc to the<br>
reproducing unit 10. The recording/reproducing unit 10 performs the<br>
recording/reproduction in the specific area according to the command of the<br>
control unit 20. The recording/reproducing unit 10 can employ an optical<br>
drive.<br>
The recording/reproducing unit 10 can include an interface unit 12 for<br>
performing communication with an external device such as the control unit<br>
20; a pickup unit 11 for directly recording or reproducing data to/from the<br>
optical disc; a data processor 13 for receiving the reproduction signal from<br><br>
the pickup unit 11 to convert the receive signal into appropriate signal<br>
values, or for modulating a to-be-recorded signal into an appropriate<br>
recording signal for the optical disc; a servo unit 14 for controlling the<br>
pickup unit 11 to precisely read the signals from the optical disc, or to<br>
precisely record the signals on the optical disc; a memory 15 for temporarily<br>
storing a variety of information including the management information and<br>
data; and a microprocessor 16 for controlling the operations and structural<br>
elements within the unit 10.<br>
A description of a disc playback method using the TAI in a<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to any embodiment of the<br>
present invention is now provided referring to FIG. 8.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, if the write-once optical disc is loaded in the optical<br>
recording/ reproducing apparatus, the apparatus moves to the TDMA0 of the<br>
disc to read the TAI (S10). It is determined whether or not the loaded disc is<br>
closed by examining the TAI information, particularly, the DMA disc-closing<br>
indicator of the TAI (S20).<br>
At this time, if it is determined that the disc is closed since the DMA disc<br>
closing indicator cluster is in the recorded state, the apparatus moves the<br>
pick-up unit to a designated area (e.g., a DMA) to read the last recorded<br>
management information (S30). In case where the disc is closed as described<br>
above, recording on the disc can no longer be performed. Therefore, the<br>
management information is utilized to perform the playback of data (S40).<br><br>
On the other hand, if it is determined that if the disc is not<br>
closed, the recording/reproducing apparatus moves to the in-use-TDMA<br>
indicated by the TDMA in-use indicator cluster(s) of the TAI to read the<br>
management information including the latest TDDS information recorded in<br>
the in-use-TDMA (S50). Such TDDS information may also be obtained from<br>
the TAI. Also the recording/reproducing apparatus first reads the "fixed<br>
management field" information from the TDDS recorded in the TAI to obtain<br>
information on the entire disc structure and the like and then, can also<br>
move to the currently in-use TDMA area to read the latest "variable<br>
management field" information.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, after the last management information of the disc is<br>
read, the data is recorded or played-back according to a user's selection or<br>
as needed (S60).<br>
Applying the method of FIG.8 to the apparatus of FIG. 7, if the optical disc is<br>
loaded, the recording/reproducing unit 10 obtains a variety of recorded disc<br>
information from the loaded optical disc. Specifically, if the loaded optical<br>
disc is the write-once optical disc, for example, BD-WO, the microcomputer<br>
16 accesses the TAI and obtains the TAI information recorded in the TDMA0<br>
area in order to determine whether or not the loaded disc is closed and to<br>
obtain the location of the in-use-TDMA.<br><br>
If the disc is determined to be closed in view of the TAI information, the<br>
recording can be no longer performed on the disc. Therefore, the<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10 performs the disc playback through a<br>
playback command of the control unit 20 under the control of the<br>
microcomputer 16. If the disc is not closed in view of the TAI information,<br>
the location of the in-use-TDMA to obtain the last TDMS information<br>
recorded in the in-use TDM A is obtained from the TAI, and the obtained<br>
TDMS information is utilized to perform the playback by the<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10 under the control of the microcomputer 16<br>
according to a playback command of the control unit 20.<br>
On the other hand, a method for recording the TAI using the optical<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus of FIG. 7 according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is described as follows.<br>
The microcomputer 16 within the playback unit 10 records the TDMS<br>
information to the plurality of TDMAs in a specific use sequence. For<br>
example, the TDMA0 first is used. If the TDMA0 is fully used up, the TDMA1<br>
in-use indicator cluster of the TAI within the TDMA0 is changed to be in the<br>
recorded state to indicate that the TDMA1 is currently in use. The recorded<br>
state of the TDMA1 in-use indicator cluster can be realized by recording the<br>
recorded TDDS information already recorded in the TDMA0 or some other<br>
designated data as discussed above.<br>
In case where there is no longer any cluster to be recorded or the disc is<br><br>
closed by a closing command of the control unit 20 according to a user's<br>
request or like while recording is performed, the microcomputer 16 controls<br>
to transfer and record the latest TDMS information, which is recorded in the<br>
latest TDMA, into each of the DMAs (duplicate recording for redundancy<br>
purpose), and controls to change the DMA disc closing indicator cluster of<br>
the TAI to be in the recorded state.<br>
When the disc is in an idle state or in a disc eject state after the disc<br>
recording is all finished, the location of the in-use-TDMA is determined such<br>
that the above operation can change the specific cluster within the<br>
corresponding TAI to be in a batch record state.<br>
As described above, the present invention has an advantage in that the<br>
write-once optical disc is efficiently used through a method for recording and<br>
using the TAI including both the TDMA in-use indicator(s) and the disc<br>
closing indicator. By accessing the TAI initially, the identity of the in-use<br>
TDMA at that time can be quickly obtained, information on whether or not<br>
the disc is closed can be easily obtained, and management information such<br>
as the latest TDDS information can also be easily obtained.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that<br>
the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and<br>
their equivalents.<br><br>
