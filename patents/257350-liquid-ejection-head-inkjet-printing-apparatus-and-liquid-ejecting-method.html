TITLE OF THE INVENTION LIQUID EJ3CTI0N HEAD, INKJET PRINTING APPARATUS AND LIQUID<br>
EJECTING METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]    Than present invention relates to a liquid ejection head for ejecting ink droplets, an inkjet printing apparatus and a liquid ejecting method, and particularly relates to enhancement of rhe durability of a liquid ejection head. Description of rhe Related Art<br>
[0002] Ink ejecting methods applied to generally-used inkjet printing apparatuses include a method for ejecting ink droplets by using a liquid ejection head in which heat-generating elements, such as heaters, are arranged as ejection-energy generating elements. In this method, first:, ink around a heat-generating element is instantaneously bailed by applying a voltage to an electrothermal transducing element functioning as the heat generating element. A phase change of the ink at the time of boiling creates an abrupt increase of pressure, so that ink droplets are ejected from the liquid ejection head. By ejecting ink droplets in this manner, the inkjet printing apparatus can finely control the ejection of ink droplets in response to an electric signal. [0003] An ink ejecting method using the heat-genersting elements, such as electrothermal transducing elements, has advantages that a large space is not needed to arrange the<br>
- 1<br><br>
ejection-energy generating elements; the structure of the printing head is simple; and thus a large number of nozzles can be easily arranged in a smaller space, for example. For these reasons, a growing number of Inkjet printing apparatuses using this ink ejecting method have been in use recently. [0004] However, in a case where printing is performed by the ink ejecting method, the pressure of ink may abruptly change and induce cavitations upon bursting of a bubble made in the ink by the heat-generating element. If this abrupt pressure change occurs around any of the heat-generating elements, it is likely to make an impact on the heat-generating element. The impact adversely affects the durability of the heat-generating element. Methods have been proposed for preventing such an abrupt pressure change from deteriorating the durability of heat-generating elements, and one of the methods is to print with a printing head disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Publication Ho. Hei. 11-1888'70. [00051 Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei. 11-1888 70 discloses a printing head which causes bubbles and the atmosphere to communicate with each other once the bubbles start to reduce their volume. In the case where printing is performed by ejecting ink droplets from the printing head disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei. 11-188870, a portion of ink which iraiaediately follows each ejected main droplet of ink has a component which tends to shrink toward the heat-generating element. This facilitates separation of the main droplet from the portion of ink which<br><br>
would turn into a satellite droplet if ejected. Accordingly, This mechanism makes it possible to separate satellite droplets in case the ink ejection is performed, from the main droplets, thereby checking the occurrence of the satellite droplets. Thus, the occurrence of the satellite droplets which are separated from main droplets is prevented and prevents occurrence of a mist of ink floating between the printing apparatus and the printing medium.<br>
[0006] In general, in the printing head which causes bubbles and the atmosphere to communicate with each other in the process of growth and shrinkage of the bubbles, gas forming each bubble is discharged to the outside when the bubble and the atmosphere communicate with each other. As a result, once the bubble disappears, the amount of gas existing in the liquid-decreases. This inhibits an abrupt change in pressure in the liquid, and accordingly enhances the durability of the heaters. [0007] However, even if the printing head which causes bubbles and the atmosphere to communicate with each other in the process of growth and shrinkage of the bubbles is used, a bubble is sometimes left in the liquid after the liquid droplet is ejected, so that the bubble abruptly changes the pressure inside the bubbling chamber when it bursts.<br>
[0008]    Fig. lOA is a cross-sectional view of a nozzle in a printing head of a conventional atmosphere-corainunication type. The nozzle is viewed in the ejection direction. Fig. lOB is a cross-sectional view of the nozzle, taken along the line B-B of Fig. lOA, In the printing head in which bubbles and the<br><br>
atmosphere communicate with each other when the bubbles shrink, a bubble communicates with the atmosphere by contacting the meniscus which moves toward the heat-generating element when the liquid droplet is ejected. At this time, the meniscus moves almost symmetrically with respect to an axis perpendicularly passing the center of the heat-generation element and keeps its shape symmetrical. By contrast, the shape of the bubble is partially asymmetrical because of zhe shape of the nozzle. Because the ink passage extends toward the ink supplying port, there is no wall surface restricting the shape of the bubble in that direction. However, there is a wall surface forming zhe bubbling chamber in the far-end portion thereof at the side opposite to the ink supplying port. The wall surface located in the far-end portion of the bubbling chamber restricts the growth of the bubble. As a result, a part of a bible located at the ink supplying port side in the bubbling chamber partially has a different shape from a part of the bubble located at the far-end portion opposite to the ink supplying port side. In sum, at the ink supplying port side in the bubbling chamber, the part of the bubble grows larger without having any restriction, thus having a relatively large grown part. In contrast, at the far-end portion of the bubbling chamber, the bubble has a relatively small grown part because the wall surface forming the bubbling chamber restricts the growth of the part of the bubble there.<br>
[00091    When the liquid droplet is ejected with the bubble enlarging in this manner, then the meniscus moves toward the<br><br>
heat-generating eleinent. In this situation, it is likely that, as shown in Fig. lOB, the atmosphere may communicate with the part of the bubble at the ink supplying port side, whereas the atmosphere may not communicate with the part of the bubble at the far-end portion. As a result, a split part of the bubble not conununicating with the atmosphere is likely to remain at zhe far-end portion of the bubbling chamber. Furthermore, an abrupt pressure change may occur in the liquid existing inside the bubbling chamber when this split part of the bubble disappears, and accordingly an impact may be directed against the heat-generating element.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [00101 A liquid ejection head, an Inkjet printing apparatus and an ejecting method provide for ejection of ink without leaving behind any bubble inside each nozzle. This is achieved by use of a liquid ejection head which has an improved durability by causing bubbles and the atmosphere to communicate with each other when ejecting the ink,<br>
lOOll] The present invention provides a liquid ejection head which causes bubbles and the atmosphere to communicate with each other. The durability of the liquid ejection head is enhanced by prevents bubbles from remaining in each bubbling chamber when a liquid is ejected. Thus, an impact directed against the corresponding heat-generating element is suppressed. In addition, the present invention is capable of<br><br>
providing an ink]et printing apparatus for printing by use of such a liquid ejection head.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0022]    Descriptions will be provided hereinbelow for a first embodiment for carrying out the present invention by use of the attached drawings.<br>
[0023] Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of an Inkjet printing apparatus 2 in which a printing head 1 of the first embodiment of 'the present invention is used as a liquid ejection head. Inkjet cartridges corresponding to multiple colors are mounted on the Inkjet printing apparatus 2 with a carriage. Each Inkjet cartridge is provided with a printing head 1 for ejecting ink to a printing mediuiu.<br>
[0024] Fig. 2A shows a partially cut-away, perspective view of the printing head 1 used in the Inkjet printing apparatus 2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the printing head 1 is formed by bonding<br><br>
an orifice plate 4 to a substrate 3. Fig. 2B shows a plan view of the substrate 3, which is one of the component parts constituting the printing head 1. A common liquid chamber 5 is formed between the substrate 3 and the orifice plate 4, and the connnon liquid chamber 5 temporarily reserves ink as a liquid i\7hlch turns into liquid droplets when ejected. In addition, multiple nozzles 6 through which ink is ejected are formed in the two side portions of the common liquid chamber 5 located between the substraiie 3 and the orifice plate 4. Each nozzle 6 includes a bubbling chamber 7, an ejection port part 8 and an ink passage 9. The multiple nozzles 6 are arranged in parallel rows to form nozzle rows, and the nozzle rows are arranged extending in parallel, so that the nozzle rows sandwiches an ink supplying port 10. A pair of the nozzle rows formed so as to sandwich the ink supplying port 10 is formed in a way that the ejection port parts 8 of the two rows are arranged in a staggering manner. The bubbling chamber 7 is formed in an end portion of each nozzle 6. The ink passage 9 is formed between the common liquid chamber 5 and the bubbling chamber 7 of each nozzle S. The ink passage 9 introduces ink into the bubbling chamber 7.<br>
[0025] Figs. 3A, SB shows a cross-sectional view of the inside of the common liquid chamber 5 and one of the nozzles 6, both formed between the substrate 3 and the orifice plate 4. Fig. 3A is a cross-sectional view of one nozzle 5 and the common liquid chamber 5 viewed in the ejection direction. Fig. 3B is a cross-sectional view of the nozzle 6 and the common liquid<br><br>
chamber 5 viewed in a direction orthogonal to the ejection direction. Each of Figs. 3A and 3B is the cross-sectional view of the no7.zls 6 and the coratnon liquid chamber 5, taken along the III-III line of the printing head 1 shown in Fig. 2A. Inside the common liquid chamber 5, multiple column-shaped nozzle filters 14 are arranged in the same direction as the nozzles 6. The nozzle filters 14 are arranged upstream of the ink passages 9 inside the common liquid chamber 5, preventing dusts and the like from flowing into the ink passages 9. In addition, -he arrangement cf these nozzle filters 14 between the substrate 3 and the orifice plate 4 prevents the orifice plate 4 from separating away from the substrate 3, and supports load coming from the orifice plate 4,<br>
[0026] The ejection port parts 8 are formed to eject ink supplied from the common liquid chamber 5 to the inside of the corresponding bubbling chamber 7 in the orifice plate 4. The ejection port part 8 is an opening portion located in the front end of the nozzle 6 which is opened in order for ink droplets to be ejected from the bubbling chamber 7 to the atmosphere. In addition, the ink supplying port 10 is formed in the substrate 3 as a liquid supplying port, supplying ink to the common liquid chamber 5, The ink supplying port 10 extends in the same direction as the nozzles 6 in the nozzle rows are arranged. An electrothermal ::ransducing element 11 is arranged on the substrate 3 inside the bubbling chamber 7. The location of the electrothermal transducing element 11 on the substrate 3 is opposed to the ejection port part 8. As a heat generating<br><br>
element, the electrothermal transducing element 11 generates thermal energy for ejacting ink. The bubbling chaitiber 7 is a component part where ink as a liquid is temporarily reserved, and where bubbles are generated by boiling the ink so that the bubbles thus generated impart kinetic energy to ink which is going to be ejected.<br>
[0027] The ejection port parts 8 are tormed m the printing head 1 of the present embodiment. Each ejection port parr 8 ejects ink there through. The thermal energy is imparted to the ink by the electrothermal transducing element 11 inside the bubbling chair'ljer 7 which is an energy effect chamber. In addition, each ejection port p-arr 8 is formed to include a first ejection port part 12 and a second ejection port part 13. The first ejection port part 12 aomraunicates with the atmosphere. The second ejection port part 13 is formed between the bubbling chamber 7 and the first ejection port part 12.   The<br>
cross-section of the second ejection port part 12 in a direction<br>
orthogonal to the ejection direction is larger than the cross-section of the first ejection port part 12 in the<br>
direction  orthogonal  to  the  ejection  direction.   For<br>
explanatory convenience, a supply directi.on is defined as a<br>
direction in which ink is supplied from the common liquid<br>
chamber 5 to the inside of the bubbling chamber 7 in the ejection<br>
port part 8.  An orthogonal direction is defined as being<br>
orthogonal to this supply direction, and as being the same as<br>
the direction in which the rows of the ejection port parts 8<br>
and the ink supplying port IG extend in the present embodiment.<br><br>
[0028] In the present embodiment, the center of the second ejection port part 13 in an ink supply direction, from the ink supplying port to the b&gt;abbling chamber 7, is offset from the center of the eiecirotherinal transducing element 11 in the ink supply direction from the ink supplying port to the bubbling chamber 7, toward a far-end side of the bubbling chamber 7 in the ink supply direction from the ink supplying port to the bubbling chamber. Here, the ink supply direction is a direction in which ink is supplied from the ink supplying port 10 to the<br>
bubbling chamber 7. In contrast, the centers respectively of the elecrrctheritial transducing element 11 and the first ejection port part 12 are not offset from each other. That is to say, the two centers are set at the same location. As a result, the center of the second ejection port part 13 is arranged to be eccentric to the center of the first ejection port part 12. Fig. 4 Shows a cross-sectional view of the nozzle 6 of the present embodiment, which is shown in Fig. 3B, and which is ejecting<br>
a liquid droplet. In this respect, reference numeral 01 denotes -he center of the elecrrothermal transducing element 11 as shown<br>
in Figs. 3A and 3B.  Reference numeral 11 denotes a line<br>
extending from the center of the electrothermal transducing<br>
element 11 in the ejection direction.  In addition, reference<br>
numeral 12 denotes a line which extends in the ejection<br>
direction, and which passes the center of the second ejection<br>
port part 13. Reference numeral 02 denotes a point at which<br>
•The line 12 crosses over the bottom surface of the bubbling<br>
chamber 7 . In other words, reference numeral 02 denotes a point<br><br>
obtained by projecting the center of the second ejection port part 13 to a plane on which the bottom surface of the bubbling chamber 7 exist. The centers 01 and 02 of the respective spaces are shown in each of Figs. 3A and 3B. In this respect, a "center" is defined as a center of gravity of a space which is filled with a homogeneous mass. As shown in Fig. 3A, when the nozzle 6 is viewed in the ejection direction, the center 02 of the second ejection port part 13 is offset from the center 01 of the electrothermal transducing element 11 in the supply direction. In the present embodiment, the hole of the second ejection port part 13 is formed to have an ellipse-shaped cross-section orthogonal to the ejection direction. Furthermore, the second ejection port part 13 is shaped like an ellipse which is formed long in the supply direction with a long axis extending in the supply direction and with a short axis extending in the orthogonal direction.<br>
[0029] A description will be provided for how the printing head 1 behaves, when the printing head 1 of the present embodiment is used for ejecting ink.<br>
[0030] Once the electrothermal transducing element 11 is energized, the electrothermal transducing element 11 generates heat through converting electric energy to heat. Thereby, inside the bubbling chamber 7 facing the electrothermal transducing element 11, ink situated on the electrothermal transducing element 11 is instantaneously boiled, and a bubble is thus generated. Once the bubble is generated in the bubbling chamber 7, ink inside the bubbling chamber 7 is pushed back due<br><br>
to an abrupt increase of pressure caused by the change of the ink from a liquid phase to a gaseous phase, and ink situated above the electrothermal transducing element 11 is pressed and moved. Subsequently, the ink moving inside the bubbling chamber 7 is pressed toward the ej ection port part 8 by the bubble thus generated, and the ink is ejected from the ejection port part 8. The ink ejected from the ejection port part 8 impacts in a predetermined position on the printing medium. [0031] In the present embodiment, because the center of the second ejection port part 13 is arranged to be eccentric to the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 in the supply direction, the second ejection pdrt part 13 is formed asymmetrical with respect to the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. In other words, a portion on the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 (hereinafter referred to as "a first portion of the second ejection port 13.") is formed to be relatively large. The other portion of the second ejection port part 13 on the other side (side opposite to the ink-supplying-side) of the center of ^ the electrothermal transducing element 11 (hereinafter referred to as 'a second portion of the second ejection port part 13") is formed to be relatively small. For this reason, the fluidity of ink inside the second ejection port part 13 is different between the first and second portions of the second ejection port part 13. [0032] With regard to ink reserved in the first portion of the second ejection port part 13, the amount of ink reserved<br><br>
in a location relatively far away from the wall surface defining the second ejection port part 13 is relatively larger. For this reason, the ink reserved in the first portion of the second ejection port part 13 is less affected by resistance from the wall surface while the ink is flowing, and the fluidity of this ink is accordingly higher. By contrast, with regard to ink reserved in the second portion of the second ejection port part 13, the amount of ink reserved in a location relatively near the wall surface is relatively larger. For this reason, the ink reserved in the second portion of the second ejection port part 13 is more affected by resistance from the wall surface while the ink is moving, and the fluidity of this ink is accordingly lower. As a result, after ink is ejected, while the meniscus is moving toward the electrothermal transducing element 11, the amount of movement of the meniscus is different between the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 and the other side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. [0033] Having a higher fluidity, the ink reserved in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 has a meniscus moving toward the electrothermal transducing element 11 by an amount per unit time larger than the ink reserved in the other side of the ink supply direction. As a result, when the bubble and the atmosphere communicate with each other, ink reserved in the first portion of the second ejection port part 13 moves more than ink reserved in the second portion of the second ejection port part 13.<br><br>
[0034] At this time, the bubble generated by the drive of the electrothermal transducing element 11 grows asymmetrically because the ink passage inside the nozzle 5 is formed into the shape asymmetrical with respect to the axis of the electrothermal transducing element 11. Specifically, a part of the bubble located in the other side of the ink supply direction, grows relatively more easily, and is accordingly formed relatively larger than the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. As a result, while ink is in the process of being ejected, the moving meniscus and the part of the bubble communicate with each other at the location in the other side of the ink supply direction of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. [0035] In this respect, if the nozzle 6 had a shape in which the second ejection port part 13 is concentric with the electrothermal transducing element 11 in both the supply direction and in the orthogonal direction, a small bubble would remain in a space located in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11, Accordingly, the remaining bubble would adversely affect the durability of the electrothermal transducing element 11 by directing an impact against the electrothermal transducing element 11 when the bubble disappears.<br>
[0036] In the present embodiment, however, the second ejection port part 13 is formed to be eccentric to the electrothermal transducing element 11 in the supply direction. For  this  reason,  when  the meniscus moves  toward  the<br><br>
electrothermal transducing element 11, a part of the meniscus which gets closest to the bottom surface of the bubbling chamber 7 is situated in a location beyond an end portion of the bubble in the supply direction. As a result, the meniscus which moves more in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 crushes a part of the bubble located in ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. Accordingly, the part of the bubble is pushed out toward the other side of the ink supply direction. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 4, the bubble overall moves toward the other side of the ink supply direction, and thus is not split which would otherwise occur due.to the meniscus moving toward the electrothermal transducing element 11. Resultantly, no bubble remains in the space located in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11, and the part of the bubble which is originally located in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal Transducing element 11 merges into the remaining part of the bubble located in the other side of the ink supply direction of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. Eventually, a relatively large bubble is formed.<br>
[0037] The bubble thus formed communicates with the atmosphere at the location in the other side of the ink supply direction of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11. Thereby, gas that forms the bubble is released into the atmosphere. This makes it likely that no gas may be left<br><br>
behind in the ink reserved in the bubbling chamber 7. As shown in Fig. 4, this prevents the bubble from remaining in the space located in the ink-supplying-side of the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11, and the gas enclosed in the bubble formed in the ink reserved in the bubbling chamber 7 is released into the atmosphere by the communication of the bubble with the atmosphere. This release prevents the bubble from being left behind in the ink reserved in the bubbling chamber 7, and accordingly makes it possible to prevent an impact from being directed against the surface of the electrothermal transducing element 11. Prevention of the impact makes it possible to enhance the durability of the electrothermal transducing element 11, and resultantly makes it possible to enhance the durability of the printing head 1. Furthermore, it is possible to enhance the durability of the Inkjet printing apparatus 2 for which the printing head 1 is used.<br>

[0038] Next, a description will be provided for a printing head 1' of a second embodiment by use of Figs. 5A and 5B. Component parts which can be configured in the same manner as those of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals in Figs. 5A, 5B, and descriptions for those component parts will be omitted, and be provided for only component parts which are different from those of the first embodiment. [0039] Fig. 5A shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1' of the second embodiment viewed in the ejection<br><br>
direction. Fig. 5B shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1' of the second embodiment taken along the B-B line of Fig. 5A. The second ejection port part is shaped like an ellipse in each printing head 1' of the present embodiment and the printing head 1 of the first embodiment. However, the orientation of the long and short axes of the second ejection port part 13' in the printing head 1' is different from that of the second ejection port part 13 in the printing head 1. In -he case of the printing head 1 of the first embodiment, the second ejection port part 13 has the long axis extending in the supply direction and the short axis extending in the orthogonal direction. In the case of the printing head 1' of the second embodiment, the second ejection port part 13' has a long axis extending in the orthogonal direction and a short axis extending in the supply direction. In the present embodiment, as described above, the cross-section of the second ejection port part 13' in a direction orthogonal to the ejection direction is shaped with its projected diameter orthogonal to the supply direction is longer than its projected diameter in the supply direction on the plane on which the bottom surface of the bubbling chamber is located.<br>
[0040] As a result, the electrothermal transducing element 11' is shaped with ics length in the orthogonal direction is longer than its length in the supply direction. The second ejection port part 13' and the electrothermal transducing element 11' may be shaped as shown for the second embodiment.<br><br>
(Third Embadimem:)<br>
[0041] Next, descriptions will be provided for a printing head 1' ' of a third embodiment by use of Figs. 5A and 6B. Fig. 6A shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1' ' of the third embodiment viewed from the ejection direction. E"ig. 5B shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1' of the third embodiment, taken along the B-3 line of Fig. 6A. In Figs. 6A and €B, component parts which can be configured in the same manner as these of the first and second embodiments are denoted by the same reference numerals. Descriptions will be omitted for those component parts, and be provided for componen- parts cf the third embodiment which are different from those of the first and second embodiments.<br>
[0042] , In the case of the printing head 1 of the first embodimentr the center of the second ejection port part 13 is offset from the centers respectively of the first ejection port part 12 and the electrothermal transducing element 11. By contrast, in the case of the printing head of the present embodiment, the first ejection port part 12 and the second ejection port part 13' ' are formed in a way that their respective centers correspond with each other in the supply direction and in the orthogonal direction. In addition, the centers 02 of the first ejection port part 12 and the second ejection port oarr 13' ' thus corresponding with each other is offset from the center 01 of the electrothermal transducing element 11 in the sur-&gt;ply direction. Because the ejection port part 8 is thus formed, the meniscus is not formed one-sided and moves toward<br><br>
cne eiec-crotneriTiai cransaucing element 11 wnile keeping its<br>
shape symmetrical with respect to the centers respectively of<br>
the first ejection port part 12 and the second ejection port<br>
part 13', when a liquid droplet is ejected.<br>
[0043]    This movement prevents a liquid droplet from being<br>
affected by a force created by the shape cf the meniscus which<br>
would be otherwise asymmetrical.  As a result, the liquid<br>
droplet is ejected straight in the ejection direction.  This<br>
straight ejection makes the ejected droplet impact exactly in a    predetermined    position,     and    thus    the<br>
liquid-droplet-impacting precision of the printing head i' is kept high.<br>
[0044] A^ this time, a bubble is generated on the electrothermal transducing element 11. The bubble thus generated contacts and communicates with the meniscus moving<br>
toward the electrothermal transducing element 11. In this respect, because the centers respectively of the first ejection port part 12 and the second ejection port part 13' ' are offset fron the center of the electrothermal transducing element 11 in the  supply direction,  the meniscus  contacts,  and<br>
subsequently communicates with, the bubble in a way that the meniscus is offset from the center of the bubble in the supply d. rection. As a result, when the meniscus comes closer to the eiectrothermal transducing element 11 after its movement, a part of the meniscus closest to the bottom surface of the bubbling chamber 7 in a location beyond the center of the ejection port part 6 in the supply direction is situated in a<br><br>
loca-icn beyond an end portion of the bubble in the supply<br>
direction. Fig. 7 shows a cross-sectional view of the inside<br>
of the nozzle 6 through which a liquid droplet is about to be<br>
ejected. Because, shown in Fig. 7, the part of the meniscus<br>
closest to the bottom surface of the bubbling chamber 7 is<br>
situated in the location beyond the end portion of the bubble<br>
in the supply direction, the bubble is pushed in a direction<br>
apposite to the supply direction when the meniscus moves toward<br>
zhe electrothermal transducing element 11. This push prevents<br>
the bubble from being split, and thus prevents a split part of<br>
the bubble from being left behind in a part of the ejection port<br>
part S lying beyond the center of the electrotherm.al transducing<br>
element 11 in the supply direction.<br>
[0045] . Because a part of the bubble is prevented from being left behind inside the bubbling chan^ber 7, this makes it<br>
possible to prevent the surface of the electrothermal<br>
transducing element 11 from receiving an impact which would<br>
otherwise occur due to an abrupt pressure change when the bubble<br>
disappears.  This prevention makes it possible to enhance the<br>
durability of the electrothermal transducing element 11, and<br>
consequently to enhance the durability of the printing head 1' ' . Furthermore, this makes it possible to enhance the durability<br>
of the Inkjet printing apparatus 2 using the printing head 1' ' . [00463 In the case of the printing head 1', as described above, it is possible to prevent the bubble from remaining insia.;j the bubbling chamber 7, and thereby enhancing the durability of the electrothermal transducing elemant 11, as<br><br>
well as inhibiting the deterioration of the impacting precision<br>
of the liquid droplet:. (Fourth Embodiment)<br>
[0047]    Next, a description will be provided for a printing<br>
head 1' ' ' of a fourth embodiment by use of Figs. 8A and 8B. Fig, 8A shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1'' of<br>
the fourth embodiment viewed i.n  the ejection direction. Fig.<br>
3B shows a cross-sectional view of the printing head 1'-' of the fourth embodiment, ta.icen along the B-B line of Fig. 8A. In<br>
Figs. 8A, 8B, component parts which can be configured in the<br>
same manner as those of the first to third embodiments are<br>
denoted by rhe same reference numerals. "'Descriptions v.'ill be<br>
omitted for those component parts, and be provided f or corr&gt;ponent parts or tns rourtn emEcaiment which are different from those or tne first to third embodiments,<br>
[0048]    In the case of the printing head 1' of the third<br>
embodiment, the second ejection port part 13' is shaped like<br>
an ellipse which has a long axis extending in the supply<br>
direction. By contrast, the printing head 1' ' ' of the present<br>
-'mbcdiment is different from the printing head 1' ' of the third .-embodiment in that the second ejection port part 13 ' ' ' is shaped like an ellipse which has a long axis extending in the orthogonal<br>
-irection and a short axis extending in the supply direction. [0049] I.n addition, in the present embodiment, the ej ectrothermal transducing element 11 is formed with its length ia ti;e orthogonal direction longer than its length in the supply direc-.ion, in response to the second ejection port part 13''<br><br>
which is formed with its length in the orthogonal direction is longer than its length in the supply direction.  The second ejection port part 13'' and the electrothermal transducing element 11 may be formed in this manner. (Other Embodiments)<br>
[0050] It should be noted that the liquid_ejection head of the present invention can be installed in machines such as printers, copying machines, facsimile machines including a communications system, and word processors including a printer part, as well as industrial printing machines combined with various processing machines. Use of this type of the liquid ejection head makes it possible to print on various printing media including paper, thread, fiber, cloth, leather, metals, plastics, glass, wood, and ceramics. It should be noted that the term "printing" used in the description is defined as imparting not only meaning-carrying images such as characters and figures but also images which carry no meaning, such as patterns, to various printing media.<br>
[0051] In addition, the terms "ink" and "liquid" used in the description should be widely construed as being substances which go beyond their literal meanings. The terms "ink" and "liquid" are defined as being substances used to form images, designs, patterns and the like, and to process printing media, as well as to treat ink and printing media, through their application onto the printing media. In this respect, enhancing the fixing property of ink applied to printing media through its solidification or insolubilization, and enhancing<br>
23<br><br>
the printing quality and color development of the ink, as well as enhancing the image durability, is taken examples as a treating ink and printing media, for example. [0052] In the case of the foregoing embodiments, the cross-section of the second ejection port part in the direction orthogonal to the ejection direction is shaped in an ellipse. As shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, instead, the cross-section of the second ejection port part in the direction orthogonal to the ejection direction may be shaped like a circle instead. In this case, as shown in Fig. 9A, only the second ejection port part may be formed to be offset from the first ejection port part and the electrothermal transducing element in the supply direction. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 9B, the first and second ejection port parts may be formed to be offset from the electrothermal transducing element.<br>
