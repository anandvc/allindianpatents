Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel kinase inhibitors and modulator compounds useful for the treatment of various diseases. More particularly, the invention is concerned with such compounds, kinase/compound adducts, methods of treating diseases, and methods of syntliesis of the compounds. Preferrably, the compounds are useful for the modulation of kinase activity of Raf kinases and disease polymorphs thereof.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Several members of the protein kinase family have been clearly implicated in the patliogenesis of various proliferative diseases and thus represent important targets for treatment of these diseases. Some of the proliferative diseases relevant to this invention include cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and retinopathies. Important examples of kinases which have been shown to cause or contribute to the pathogensis of these diseases including, but not limited to. BRaf, CRaf, Abl, KDR(VEGF), EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3, cMET, FLT-3, PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, p38, cKIT, JAK2.<br>
A major signaling pathway downstream of cell surface growth factor receptor activation is the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway (Peyssonnaux, C. et al, Biol. Cell (2001) 93: 53-62, Cancers arise when mutations occur in one or more of the proteins involved in this signaling cascade. Cell proliferation and differentiation become dysregulated and cell survival mechanisms are activated which allow unregulated cancer cells to override protective programmed cell death surveillance. Mutations in die p21-Ras protein have been shown to be a major cause of dysregulation of this signaling pathway, leading to the development of human cancers. P21-Ras mutations have been identified in approximately 30% of human cancers (Bolton et al, Ann. Rep. Med. Cfiem. (1994) 29: 165-174).   Cancer-causing mutations in the P21-<br><br>
Ras fStein lead to a constituitively active signaling cascade, causing unregulated activation of the downstream components of the RAF-MEK-ERJC-MAP kinase pathway (Magnuson el al, Semin.Cancer Biol. (1994) 5: 247-253). The three RAF kinases which participate in this signaling cascade are known as ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (Peyssonnaux, C. et al, Biol Cell (2001) 93: 53-62; Avruch, J., Recent Prog. Norm. Res. (2001) 56: 127-155; Kolch, W., Biochem. J. (2000) 351: 289-305). These RAF kinase isoforms are all activated by Ras, and thus arc activated in cancers that result from mutated and upregulated p21-Ras protein activity. In addition to activation of this signaling cascade at the initial p2l-Ras protein level, mutations have also been found in BRAF kinase which results in activation of the cascade downstream from p21-Ras (Davies, H., et al, Nature (2002) 417: 949-954). A dominant single site mutation at position 600 in the BRAF kinase was shown to be particularly aggressive and linked to approximately 80% of the observed human malignant melanomas. This mutation substitutes the negatively charged amino acid glutamic acid for the normally occurring neutral amino acid valine. This single site mutation is sufficient to render the mutated BRAF kinase constituitively active, resulting in signaling pathway dysregulation and human cancer. Hence small molecule inhibitors of BRAF kinase are a rational approach to the treatment of human malignancy, whether the signaling mutation is at the level of the upstream p21-Ras protein or at the level of BRAF kinase.<br>
The majority of small molecule kinase inhibitors that have been reported have been shown to bind in one of three ways. Most of the reported inhibitors interact with the ATP binding domain of the active site and exert their effects by competing with ATP for occupancy. Other inhibitors have been shown to bind to a separate hydrophobic region of the protein known as the "DFG-in-conformation" pocket, and still others have been shown to bind to both the ATP domain and the "DFG-in-conformation" pocket. Examples specific to inhibitors of RAF kinases can be found in Lowinger et al, Current Pharmaceutical Design (2002) 8: 2269-2278; Dumas, J. et al, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery &amp; Development (2004) 7: 600-616; Dumas, J. et al WO 2003068223 Al (2003); Dumas, J., et al, WO 9932455 Al (1999), and Wan, P.T.C., et al, Ce//(2004) 116:855-867.<br>
Physiologically, kinases are regulated by a common activation/deactivation mechanism wherein a specific activation loop sequence of the kinase protein binds into a specific pocket on the same protein which   is   referred   to   as   the   switch   control   pocket   (Flynn,   D.   et   at   WO   2004 / 061084 for<br><br><br>
WO 2008/034008<br><br>
PCT/US2007/078408<br><br>
further details). Such binding occurs when specific amino acid residues of the activation loop are modified for example by phosphorylation, oxidation, or nitrosylation. The binding of the activation loop into the switch pocket results in a conformational change of the protein into its rcSwe fovm H\KA, M. sad Kuriyan, I. Ceil (109} 27S-2&amp;2.V<br>

Other preferred conditions for Scheme 1, step 4 include combining aldehyde 4, ester 5 and alumina-supported potassium fluoride in DMAc with stirring and optional sonication and/or optional heating (30-150°C) for a period of 30 min to 48 h. The group "P" in formula 5-8 represents a hydrogen atom or an optional amine protecting group, such as tert-butyl carbamate (Boc), benzyl carbamate (Cbz), acetamide or the like. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the moiety R3-N-P-X2 in formulae 5-8. might also represent an amino surrogate such as nitro or cyano that can be converted to an amino group or aminomethyl group in step 7 by reduction under suitable conditions.<br>
In Scheme 1, step 5, the thiomethyl moiety of 6 can be oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone to provide 1_, Preferred reagents for such transformations include peroxybenzoic acids, oxone, oxaziridines, or other oxidants that will be recognized as standard oxidants of sulfur atoms by those skilled in the art. In practice, mixtures of sulfoxides and sulfones can be used in step 6 without prior separation. In step 6, the sulfone or sulfoxide moiety of 7 can be converted to a Z6 moiety that is linked to the pyridopyrimidinone through a heteroatom to provide 8. by the contacting of 7 with moieties of Z6-H [for example NH(R4)i, HOR4 or HSR4] optionally in the presence of a base such as potassium ter/-butoxide, sodium hydride or the tike or, alternatively, in the presence of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. Preferred solvents for such transformations include dioxane, DMF, THF, alcoholic solvents or neat Z6-H at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 200 °C.

Non-commercially available pyrimidines 1 can be readily prepared from known intermediate 17 [See Seto, et al Biorg, Med. Client. Lett. 2005, 7J, 1485], (Scheme 3) Thus, lithiation of J_7 with LDA followed by CO? quench provides acid jji. Conversion of acid J_8 to ester 19 provides a scaffold to introduce Z6 groups of the invention. When the Z6 moiety is attached to the pyrimidine ring through a Z6~ nitrogen atom, a Z6 oxygen atom or a Z6 sulfur atom, compounds of formula 1 can be prepared by contacting the amine Z6-H, the alcohol Z6-H or the thiol Z6-H with compound 19. either neat (Z6-H as solvent) or in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMSO or an alcoholic solvent at temperatures ranging from -78 °C to 200 °C in the presence of suitable base such as triethylamine, potassium carbonate, or potassium tert-butoxide, When the Z6 moiety is attached to the pyrimidine through a Z6 carbon atom, preferred methods include contacting compound 19 with a species of formula Z6-M in the presence of a palladium<br><br>

As shown in Scheme 4, step 5, compounds of formula 32-34 can be converted to compounds of formula 35-37 by replacement of the chloride moiety of 32-34 with a Z6 moiety. There are several methods through which this can be accomplished, depending on the nature of the Z6. When the Z6 moiety is attached to the Ql-containing ring through a Z6 nitrogen atom, preferred methods include heating compounds of formula 32-34 with an excess of the amine Z6-H either neat or in a solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone, DMF, DMSO or an alcoholic solvent at temperatures ranging from room temp to 200 °C, For the case of aryl and heteroaryl amines Z6-H, additional preferred methods include the heating of compounds 32-34 with an excess of the amine Z6-H and an acid catalyst (for example, TsOH, HC1, HOAc or die like) in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMSO or an alcoholic solvent. Additional preferred methods for aryl and heteroaryl amines Z6-H include heating with compounds ^32-34 in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such as a palladium catalyst in a suitable solvent like 1,4-dioxane or DMF.

For example, Scheme 6 shows a preferred route to preparing pyridopyridines of fonnula 48 wherein Z6 is NHMe. In Scheme 6, step ], chloropyridine 32 is reacted with (4-methoxybenzyljm ethyl amine to provide 47. Step 1 may be performed in neat (4-methoxybenzyl}methylamine at temperatures between 150 °C and 200 °C.

B-Raf(V600E) Kinase Assay: The activity of B-Raf(V600E) kinase was determined by following the formation of ADP from the reaction through coupling with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system (e.g., Schindler, et al. Science (2000) 289, 1938-1942). In this assay, the oxidation of NADH (thus the decrease at Ajnm) was continuously monitored spectrophotometrically. The reaction mixture (100 ul) contained B-Raf(V600E) kinase (2.1 nM nominal concentration), unphosphoryteted, faV-}ength MEK1 (45 nM), MgC)2 (13 mM), pyruvate kinase (3.5 units), lactate dehydrogenase (5.5 units), phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mM), and NADH (0.28 mM), in 60 mM Tris buffer, containing 0.13% octyl-glucoside and 3.5 % DMSO concentration at pH 7.5. The test compounds were incubated with the reaction mixture at 30 °C for 2h or 4h. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP (0.2 mM, final concentration). The absorption at 340 nm was continuously monitored for 3h at 30 °C on a Polarstar Optima plate reader (BMG). The reaction rate was calculated using the 1.5h to 2.5h time frame. Percent inhibition was obtained by comparison of reaction rate with that of a control (i.e. with no test compound). IC5o values were calculated from a series of percent inhibition values determined at a range of inhibitor concentrations using software routines as implemented in the GraphPad Prism software package.<br>
