				<td>COMPOUND FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a compound. In particular the present invention provides compounds capable of inhibiting 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17ß- HSD). <br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Breast cancer is a devastating disease which remains to be a major cause of death for women in most Western countries. It is estimated to affect approximately 1 million women per year across the globe.' Britain has one of the highest mortality rate for breast cancer in the world with over 35,000 women diagnosed each year accounting for nearly one in five of all cancer cases. It is estimated that 1 in 10 women living to the age of 85 in Britain will develop breast cancer during the course of her life. Although modern methods of treatment as well as an earlier detection of the disease have greatly improved survival rates, breast cancer remains the leading cause of death for women aged between 35 54. 2 All women are at risk of breast cancer although a number of risk factors have been identified, most of them being related to women's hormonal and reproductive history as well as their family background of the disease. Women at higher risk are generally those with a strong family history of the disease, early onset of menarche, late onset of menopause or a first full-term pregnancy after the age of 30. 2 In the earliest stages of a breast cancer, surgery appears to be the treatment of choice. <br>
In most of the cases, breast conserving surgical techniques, such as local incision of lump (s) in the breast (s), are involved rather than mastectomy. To prevent any recurrence of the disease, radiotherapy is often prescribed, particularly if breast conserving techniques have been involved. 3 It is also used to reduce large tumours to an operable size so that conservational surgery can be carried out. 4 For advanced breast cancers, when the tumour has spread or recurred, the aim in the treatment is no longer to cure but to reach a palliative control. This is the case when metastases of the tumour have reached locations such as bones, skin, lymph, node or brain. The treatment varies depending on the hormonal status of the patient (whether it is a pre-or post-menopausal woman to be treated) and depending on the type of tumour. Certain tumours have indeed been proven to rely on estrogens for their growth and development, leading to what is called a Hormone Dependent Breast Cancer (Hl : BC, see l-1). Whil&amp;commat; non HDBC are treated with chemotherapy, where the aim is to <br><br><br> kill differentially tumour cells using a combination of cytotoxic agents, 5 HC : BG are expected to respond to endocrine therapy. <br>
The concept of hormone dependent tumours appeared in the early 1960s, when the model of estrogens action was first introduced. s In order for estrogens to regulate cell growth and function in humans, a specific protein, called the human Oestrogen Receptor (hER), must be present.'This protein, localised in the nucleus, interacts with estrogens resulting in the formation of a binding complex. This acts as a transcription factor by activating production of m-RNA from specific genes, one or more of which are probably essential for efficient tumour cell growth. <br>
Patients with a measurable level of receptor protein are classified as oestrogen-receptor- positive (ER+) with opposition to oestrogen-receptor-negative (ER-). About 50% of pre- menopausal women and 75% of post-menopausal women fall into the ER+ group8 where the development of breast cancers can be directly linked to the presence of estrogens. <br>
Endocrine therapy, where the use of drugs results in a deprivation of estrogenic stimulation to cells, has proven to be an effective approach to the treatment of HDBC. <br>
Originally, two classes of drugs, responding to different strategies, were developed : anti- oestrogens and aromatase inhibitors. <br>
Anti-oestrogens, as antagonists of the oestrogen receptor, have been one of the first treatment considered for HDBC. Their action rely on their ability to bind competitively to the specific receptor protein hER, thus preventing access of endogenous estrogens to their specific binding site. Consequently, the natural hormone is unable to maintain tumour growth. <br>
Of the anti-oestrogens commonly used in breast cancer therapy, tamoxifen (below) is the most widely used because of the very low toxicity profile of the molecule. Despite its non-steroidal skeleton, tamoxifen possesses a mixed agonist-antagonist activity that limits its therapeutic potential. 9 In addition, some form of drug resistance has been reported in patients after long-term tamoxifen treatment. 10 Novel pure anti-oestrogenic drugs, such as ICI 164384 (below), have since been discovered but the loss of potency compared with that of tamoxifen suggested the need to design more highly potent targets." Q. (CH3) 2 1. OH I i I gp i.'' rt' I Tamoxifen ICI 164384 For some years now, a new type of anti-oestrogen has emerged, combining oestrogen agonism on target tissues such as bone or liver and antagonism and/or minimal agonism in reproductive tissues such as breasts or uterus. 12 These compounds, designed as Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), are not only potentially effective in reducing a patient's risk of breast carcinoma but they have also been shown to increase bone mineral density and prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Raloxifen is the first of this class of compounds to be used clinically. 13 More SERMs are currently in clinical trials and these molecules might one day replace tamoxifen as the first line treatment for women with HDBC. <br>
The use of therapeutic agents that inhibit one or several enzyme of the steroid biosynthesis pathway represents another important strategy to control of the development of oestrogen-dependent tumours. The enzyme aromatase, which converts androgenic C19 steroids to estrogenic C18 steroids, has been the prime target for reducing oestrogen levels. This enzyme complex, which contains a cytochrome P450 haemoprotein, catalyses the aromatisation of the androgen A-ring with the subsequent loss of the C19 methyl group to yield estrogens. <br>
Aminoglutethimide (below) was the first aromatase inhibitor used for the treatment of breast cancer. It however showed a number of undesirable side effects given its wide spectrum of inhibitory effects on other P450-dependant enzymes, and attempts to improve on the original structure have led to a number of non-steroidal compounds entering clinical trials. S The last generation developed compounds such as letrozole, which combine high potency and high selectivity for the enzyme, and are also better tolerated. rr Et 5-"1 N') \ Et Ranz H NC CN AG Letrozole Structure of different types of aromatase inhibitors. Generation I : aminoglutethimide, AG; generation lil, letrozole. <br>
Traditionally, aromatase inhibitors are reserved as second line treatment for advanced HDBC patients whose diseases are no longer controlled by tamoxifen. However, because of the extreme good toxicity profile of some of the latest aromatase inhibitors, recent clinical trials have been conducted to assess their suitability as first line treatment for HDBC. <br>
Strong evidence has emerged over the past decade, both biochemically and clinically, that the sole inhibition of the enzyme aromatase cannot afford an effective reduction of estrogenic stimulation to HDBC, the reason being that other pathways are involved in oestrogen biosynthesis. The sulphate pathway is now considered to be the major route for breast tumour oestrogen synthesis since sulphate activity was found to provide 10 fold more oestrone than the aromatase activity. 16 In the sulphate pathway, estrogens are synthesised from the highly available precursor oestrone-sulphate, via two enzymes (scheme below) : oestrone sulphate (STS) which hydrolyses oestrone-sulphate into oestrone, and 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 (3-HSD) which reduces oestrone into oestradiol. These two enzymes represent the latest targets for oestrogen deprivation strategies.

Several potent inhibitors have been identified for oestrone sulphatase. They all share the common structural feature of an aromatic ring bearing a substituent that mimics the phenolic A-ring of the enzyme substrate, oestrone-sulphate. On the development of steroidal inhibitors,'a wide variety of chemical groups have been introduced at C3, of which the 3-0-sulfamate was found to be the most potent for the oestrone molecule. <br>
The resulting compound, estrone-3-O-sulfamate (below) led to the identification of the aryl-O-sulphamate structure as an active pharmacophore required for potent inhibition of STS. EMATE was shown to inhibit steroid sulphate activity in a time-and concentration-dependent manner17 and was active in vivo on oral administration. 18 It was however revealed to be highly estrogenic which raised the need to design STS inhibitors devoid of agonist activity on hER. <br>
To avoid the problems linked to an active steroid nucleus, non steroid-based inhibitors have been synthesised. Coumarin sulphate such as 4-methylcoumarin-7-0- sulfamate (COUMATE, below), where the active pharmacophore is conserved, have been among the first inhibitors of that type to be identified.'9 Although COUMATE is less potent than EMATE, it has the advantage of being non estrogenic. 20 Some tricyclic coumarin-based sulphamates have also been developed and turned out to be much more potent than COUMATE, while retaining its non estrogenic characteristic. 21 667COUMATE, which is some 3 times more potent than EMATE in vifro is now in pre- clinical development for clinical trials. 22 EMATE COUMATE 667COUMATE. <br>
Structures of the steroid sulphatase inhibitors EMATE, COUMATE and 667COUMATE. <br>
PCT/GB92/01587 teaches novel steroid sulphate inhibitors and pharmaceutical compositions containing them for use in the treatment of oestrone dependent tumours, especially breast cancer. These steroid sulphate inhibitors are sulphate esters, such as N, N-dimethyl oestrone-3-sulphamate and, preferably, oestrone-3-sulphamate (EMATE). It is known that EMATE is a potent E1-STS inhibitor as it displays more than 99% inhibition of E1-STS activity in intact MCF-7 cells at 0.1 mM. EMATE also inhibits the E1-STS enzyme in a time-and concentration-dependent manner, indicating that it acts as an active site-directed inactivator. Although EMATE was originally designed for the inhibition of E1-STS, it also inhibits dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-STS), which is an enzyme that is believed to have a pivotal role in regulating the biosynthesis of the oestrogenic steroid androstenediol. Also, there is now evidence to suggest that androstenediol may be of even greater importance as a promoter of breast tumour growth. EMATE is also active in vivo as almost complete inhibition of rat liver E1-STS (99%) and DHA-STS (99%) activities resulted when it is administered either orally or subcutaneously. In addition, EMATE has been shown to have a memory enhancing effect in rats. Studies in mice have suggested an association between DHA-STS activity and the regulation of part of the immune response. It is thought that this may also occur in humans. The bridging 0-atom of the sulphate moiety in EMATE is important for inhibitory activity. Thus, when the 3-0-atom is replaced by other heteroatoms as in oestrone-3-N-sulphamate and oestrone-3-S-sulphamate, these analogues are weaker non-time-dependent inactivators. <br>
Although optimal potency for inhibition of E1-STS may have been attained in EMATE, it is possible that oestrone may be released during sulphatase inhibition and that EMATE and its oestradiol congener may possess oestrogenic activity. <br>
17 (3-HSD, which catalyses the final step in estrogens and androgens biosynthesis, also appeared as a target for oestrogen deprivation strategies. This enzyme is responsible for the interconversion of the oxidised form (less active) and the reduced form (more active) of steroids. its activity directly supports the growth and development of oestrogen dependent tumours since it preferably reduces oestrone into estradiol25 and in a minor extend, via the conversion of the androgen DHEA into androstenediol (Adiol), which has recently been proven to have estrogenic properties and to be able to bind to the oestrogen receptor. <br>
17ß-HSD belongs to a family of isoenzymes, 11 of which have been so far identified and cloned. 27Each type has a selective substrate affinity and directional activity which means that selectivity of drug action has to be achieved. 17 (3-HSD type 1 is the isotype that catalyses the interconversion of oestrone and oestradiol. <br>
Unlike STS inhibitors, only few 17ß-HSD inhibitors have been reported. Most of the steroidal inhibitors for 17, B-HSD type 1 have in common a D-ring modified structure. <br>
Oestradiol derivatives which contain a side-chain with a good leaving group at the lea- position have been shown to be a potent class of inhibitors. In particular, 16a- (bromoalkyl)-estradiol28 where the side-chains exhibit high reactivity towards nucleophilic amino-acids residues in the active site of the enzyme were found to be promising irreversible inhibitors. Analogues containing short bromoalkyl moieties at position 16 exhibited the highest activity with 16a- (Bromopropyl)-oestradiol, followed by 16a- (Bromobutyl)-oestradiol, the most potent of the series (3 and 4). They, however, turned out to be pure agonists of the oestrogen receptor.

In an attempt to eliminate the intrinsic oestrogenicity of potent inhibitors and possibly at the same time engineer anti-oestrogenic properties into the molecule, several 16α- (broadly)-oestradiol derivatives bearing the C7a-alkylamide side chain of the known anti- oestrogen ICI 164384 were synthesised. 29 However, rather poor inhibition of 17p-HSD type 1 was obtained, with estrogenic and anti-oestrogenic properties not completely abolished or introduced respectively. <br>
In parallel, non-steroidal inhibitors of 17ß-HSD type 1 have been designed. Flavonoids, which are structurally similar to estrogens, are able to bind to the oestrogen receptor with estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activities. 30 Their action on aromatase activity is well documented and in recent studies, they were found to reduce the conversion of oestrone into oestradiol catalysed by 17B-HSD type 1. 31 Flavone derivatives, such as apigenin emerged from a SAR study as a promising compounds with some inhibitory activity on 17ß-HSD type 1 without being estrogenic at the inhibitory concentration. 32 Ahmed et al (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1999 Jan 27; 254 (3): 811-5) report on a structure-activity relationship study of steroidal and nonsteroidal inhibitors of STS. <br>
Steroid dehydrogenases (DH) such as oestradiol 17p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (E2HSD) have pivotal roles in regulating the. availability of ligands to interact with the oestrogen receptor. E2HSD Type I reduces oestrone (E1) to the biologically active oestrogen, oestradiol (E2), while E2HSD Type in inactivates E2 by catalysing its oxidation to E1. Thus the identification of compounds having DH inhibitory activity, in particular, inhibitors of E2HSD Type I, could be of therapeutic value in inhibiting the formation of E2. <br>
SUMMARY ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds which are capable of acting as effective 1 (3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17ß-HSD) inhibitors. The present invention identifies that the compounds of the present application are effective 17ß- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17P-HSD) inhibitors. <br>
Figures 1 shows some of the enzymes involved in the in situ synthesis of oestrone from oestrone sulphate, and oestradiol."STS"denotes Oestrone Sulphatase,"E2DH Type I" denotes Oestradiol 17p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type I or Oestradiol 17p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1,3, 5 and/or 7 and"E2DH Type II" denotes Oestradiol 17 (3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type in or Oestradiol 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2 and/or 8. <br>
As can be seen, two enzymes that are invoked in the peripheral synthesis of oestrogens are the enzyme Oestradiol 17p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and the enzyme oestrone sulphatase. <br>
In situ synthesis of oestrogen is thought to make an important contribution to the high levels of oestrogens in tumours and therefore specific inhibitors of oestrogen biosynthesis are of potential value for the treatment of endocrine-dependent tumours. <br>
Moreover, even though oestrogen formation in malignant breast and endometrial tissues via the sulphate pathway makes a major contribution to the high concentration of oestrogens, there are still other enzymatic pathways that contribute to in vivo synthesis of oestrogen. I Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new therapies for the treatment of these cancers. <br>
The present invention therefore seeks to overcome one or more of the problems associated with the prior art methods of treating breast and endometrial cancers. <br>
In one aspect, therefore, the present invention provides a use of a compound for the preparation of a medicament that can or affect, such as substantially inhibit, the steroid dehydrogenase pathway-which pathway converts oestrone to and from oestradiol. <br>
This aspect of the present invention is advantageous because by the administration of one type of compound it is possible to block the synthesis of oestradiol from oestrone. Hence, the present invention provides compounds that have considerable therapeutic advantages, particularly for treating breast and endometrial cancers. <br>
The compounds of the present invention may comprise other substituents. These other substituents may, for example, further increase the activity of the compounds of the present invention and/or increase stability (ex vivo and/or in vivo). <br>

Preferably the HSD is of Type 2 and/or 8. Preferably the HSD converts oestradiol (hydroxy) to oestrone (ketone). <br>
STEROID DEHYDROGENASE Steroid dehydrogenase or"DH"for short may be classified as consisting of two types- Type I and Type II. The two types enzyme, such as oestradiol 17 (3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (E2HSD), have pivotal roles in regulating the availability of ligands to interact with the oestrogen receptor. Type I reduces oestrone (E1) to the biologically active oestrogen, oestradiol (E2) while E2HSD Type in inactivates E2 by catalysing its oxidation to E1. <br>
DH INHIBITION It is believed that some disease conditions associated with DH activity are due to conversion of a nonactive, oestrone to an active, oestradiol. In disease conditions associated with DH activity, it would be desirable to inhibit DH activity. <br>
Here, the term"inhibit"includes reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of DH. <br>
DH INHIBITOR In accordance with the present invention, the compound of the present invention is capable of acting as an DH inhibitor. <br>
Here, the term"inhibitor"as used herein with respect to the compound of the present invention means a compound that can inhibit DH activity-such as reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of DH. The DH inhibitor may act as an antagonist. <br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit steroid dehydrogenase activity can be assessed using either T47D breast cancer cells in which E2HSD Type I activity is abundant or MDA-MB-231 cells for Type in inhibitor studies. In both cell lines formation of products is linear with respect to time and cell numbers. Details on a suitable Assay Protocol are presented in the Examples section. <br>
It is to be noted that the compound of the present invention may have other beneficial properties in addition to or in the alternative to its ability to inhibit DH activity. <br>
STEROID SULPHATASE In some aspects the compounds defined herein may also inhibit steroid sulphatase. <br>
Steroid sulphatase-which is sometimes referred to as steroid sulphate or steryl sulphate or"STS"for short-hydrolyses several sulphate steroids, such as oestrone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and cholesterol sulphate. STS has been allocated the enzyme number EC 3.1. 6.2. <br>
STS has been cloned and expressed. For example see Stein et al (J. Biol. Chem. <br>
264: 13865-13872 (1989) ) and Yen et al (Cell 49: 443-454 (1987)). <br>
STS is an enzyme that has been implicated in a number of disease conditions. <br>
By way of example, workers have found that a total deficiency in STS produces ichthyosis. According to some workers, STS deficiency is fairly prevalent in Japan. The same workers (Sakura et al, J Inherit Metab Dis 1997 Nov; 20 (6): 807-10) have also reported that allergic diseases-such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis-may be associated with a steroid sulphate deficiency. <br>
In addition to disease states being brought on through a total lack of STS activity, an increased level of STS activity may also bring about disease conditions. By way of example, and as indicated above, there is strong evidence to support a role of STS in breast cancer growth and metastasis. <br>
STS has also been implicated in other disease conditions. By way of example, Le Roy et al (Behav Genet 1999 Mar ; 29 (2) : 131-6) have determined that there may be a genetic correlation between steroid sulphatase concentration and initiation of attack behaviour in <br><br><br> mice. The authors cohclude that sulphatation of steroids may be the prime mover of a complex network, including genes shown to be implicated in aggression by mutagenesis. <br>
STS INHIBITION It is believed that some disease conditions associated with STS activity are due to conversion of a nonactive, sulphate oestrone to an active, nonsulphated oestrone. In disease conditions'associated with STS activity, it would be desirable to inhibit STS activity. <br>
Here, the term"inhibit"includes reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS. <br>
STS INHIBITOR In accordance with the present invention, the compound of the present invention is capable of acting as an STS inhibitor. <br>
Here, the term"inhibitor"as used herein with respect to the compound of the present invention means a compound that can inhibit STS activity-such as reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS. The STS inhibitor may act as an antagonist. <br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphate activity can be assessed using either intact MCF-7 breast cancer cells or placenta microsomes. In addition, an animal model may be used. Details on suitable Assay Protocols are presented in following sections. It is to be noted that other assays could be used to determine STS activity and thus STS inhibition. For example, reference may also be made to the teachings of WO- A-99/50453. <br>

ASSAY FOR DETERMINING STS ACTIVITY USING CANCER CELLS (PROTOCQL 1) Inhibition of Steroid Sulphatase Activity in MCF-7 cells Steroid sulphate activity is measured in vitro using intact MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. This hormone dependent cell line is widely used to study the control of human breast cancer cell growth. It possesses significant steroid sulphate activity (Maclndoe et al. Endocrinology, 123, 1281-1287 (1988) ; Purohit &amp; Reed, Int. J. Cancer, 50,901- 905 (1992)) and is available in the U. S.A. form the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and in the U.K. (e.g. from The Imperial Cancer Research Fund). <br>
Cells are maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) containing 20 mM HEPES, 5% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamin, non- essential amino acids and 0. 075% sodium bicarbonate. Up to 30 replicate 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks are seeded with approximately 1 x 105 cells/flask using the above medium. Cells are grown to 80% confluency and the medium is changed every third day. <br>
Intact monolayers'of MCF-7 cells in triplicate 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks are washed with Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS from ICN Flow, High Wycombe, U. K.) and incubated for 3-4 hours at 37°C with 5 pmol (7 x 105 dpm) [6,7-3H] oestrone-3-sulphate (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol from New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., U. S. A. ) in serum-free MEM (2.5 mi) together with oestrone-3-sulphamate (11 concentrations: 0; 1fM ; 0. 01pM ; 0. 1pM ; 1pM ; 0. 01nM ; 0. 1nM ; 1nM ; 0. 01mM ; 0. 1mM ; 1mM).

ASSAY FOR DETERMINING STS ACTIVITY USiNG PLACENTA MICROSOMES (PROTOCOL2) Inhibition of Steroid Sulphatase Activity in Placenta Microsomes Sulphatase-positive human placenta from normal term pregnancies are thoroughly minced with scissors and washed once with cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mM) then re-suspended in cold phosphate buffer (5 ml/g tissue). Homogenisation is accomplished with an Ultra-Turrax homogeniser, using three 10 second bursts separated by 2 minute cooling periods in ice. Nuclei and cell debris are removed by centrifuging (4°C) at 2000g for 30 minutes and portions (2 ml) of the supernatant are stored at 20°C. The protein concentration of the supernatants is determined by the method of Bradford (Anal. <br>
Biochem. , 72,248-254 (1976) ). <br>
Incubations (1 ml) are carried out using a protein concentration of 100 mg/ml, substrate concentration of 20 mM [6,7-3H] oestrone-3-sulphate (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol from New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass. , U.

BIOTECHNOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING STS ACTIVITY (PROTOCOL 5 The ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity can also be assessed using amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding STS, or active fragments, derivatives, homologues or variants thereof in, for example, high-through put screens. <br>
Any one or more of appropriate targets-such as an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence-may be used for identifying an agent capable of modulating STS in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The target employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of target activity or the formation of binding complexes between the target and the agent being tested may be measured. <br>
The assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through put screen. <br>
Techniques for drug screening may be based on the method described in Geysen, European Patent Application 84/03564, published on September 13, 1984. In summary, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesised on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with a suitable target or fragment thereof and washed. Bound entities are then detected-such as by appropriately adapting methods well known in the art. A purified target can also be coated directly onto plates for use in a drug screening techniques. <br>
Alternatively, non-neutralising antibodies can be used to capture the peptide and immobilise it on a solid support. <br>
This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a target specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a target. <br>
Another technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564. <br>
It is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and Iarge-scale screening of test compounds as wet) as in quantitative assays. <br>
In one preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a method of identifying agents that selectively modulate STS, which compounds have the formula (la). <br>
REPORTERS A wide variety of reporters may be used in the assay methods (as well as screens) of the present invention with preferred reporters providing conveniently detectable signals (e. g. by spectroscopy). By way of example, a reporter gene may encode an enzyme which catalyses a reaction which alters light absorption properties. <br>
Other protocols include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilising monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non- interfering epitopes may even be used. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton R et al (1990, Serological Methods, A Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St Paul MN) and Maddox DE et al (1983, J Exp Med 15 8: 121 1). <br>
Examples of reporter molecules include but are not limited to (p-ga) actosidase, invertase, green fluorescent protein, iuciferase, chloramphenicol, acetyltransferase, (- glucuronidase, exo-glucanase and glucoamylase. Alternatively, radiolabelled or fluorescent tag-labelled nucleotides can be incorporated into nascent transcripts which are then identified when bound to oligonucleotide probes. <br>
By way of further examples, a number of companies such as Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ), Promega (Madison, Wl), and US Biochemical Corp (Cleveland, OH) supply commercial kits and protocols for assay procedures. Suitable reporter molecules or labels include those radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include US-A-3817837 ; US-A-3850752 ; US-A-3939350; US-A-3996345; US-A-4277437; US-A-4275149 and US-A-4366241. <br>
HOST CELLS The term"host cell"-in relation to the present invention includes any cell that could comprise the target for the agent of the present invention. <br>
Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention provides host calls transformed or transfected with a oolynucleotide that is or expresses the target of the present invention. <br>
Preferably said polynucleotide is carried in a vector for the replication and expression of polynucleotides that are to be the target or are to express the target. The cells will be chosen to be compatible with the said vector and may for example be prokaryotic (for example bacterial), fungal, yeast or plant cells. <br>
The gram negative bacterium E. coli is widely used as a host for heterologous gene expression. However, large amounts of heterologous protein tend to accumulate inside the cell. Subsequent purification of the desired protein from the bulk of E. coli intracellular proteins can sometimes be difficult. <br>
In contrast to E. coli, bacteria from the genus Bacillus are very suitable as heterologous hosts because of their capability to secrete proteins into the culture medium. Other bacteria suitable as hosts are those from the genera Streptomyces and Pseudomonas. <br>
Depending on the nature of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention, and/or the desirability for further processing of the expressed protein, eukaryotic hosts such as yeasts or other fungi may be preferred. In general, yeast cells are preferred over fungal cells because they are easier to manipulate. However, some proteins are either poorly secreted from the yeast cell, or in some cases are not processed properly (e. g. hyperglycosylation in yeast). In these instances, a different fungal host organism should be selected. <br>
Examples of suitable expression hosts within the scope of the present invention are fungi such as Aspergillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0184438 and EP-A- 0284603) and Trichoderma species ; bacteria such as Bacillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0134048 and EP-A-0253455), Streptomyces species and Pseudomonas species ; and yeasts such as I<iuyveromyces species as those described in ep-a-0096430 and ep-a-0301670 saccharomyces species. by way of example typical expression hosts may be selected from aspergillus niger var. tubigenis awamori aculeatis nidulans orvzae trichoderma reesei bacillus subtilis licheniformis emyloliquefeciens kluyveromyces lact : is cerevisiae.></iuyveromyces>
The use of suitable host cells-such as yeast, fungal and plant host cells-may provide for post-translatioinal modification (e.g. myristoylation, glycosylation, truncation, lapidation and tyrosine, serine or threonine phosphorylation) as may be needed to confer optimal biological activity on recombinant expression products of the present invention. <br>
ORGANISM The term"organism"in relation to the present invention includes any organism that could comprise the target according to the present invention and/or products obtained therefrom. Examples of organisms may include a fungus, yeast or a plant. <br>
The term"transgenic organism"in relation to the present invention includes any organism that comprises the target according to the present invention and/or products obtained. <br>
TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS/HOST ORGANISMS As indicated earlier, the host organism can be a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic organism. <br>
Examples of suitable prokaryotic hosts include E coli and Bacillus subtilis. Teachings on the transformation of prokaryotic hosts is well documented in the art, for example see Sambrook et al (Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) and Ausubel et a/., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. <br>
If a prokaryotic host is used then the nucleotide sequence may need to be suitably modified before transformation-such as by removal of introns. <br>
In another embodiment the transgenic organism can be a yeast. In this regard, yeast have also been widely used as a vehicle for heterologous gene expression. The species Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a long history of industrial use, including its use for heterologous gene expression. Expression of heterologous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been reviewed by Goodey et al (1987, Yeast Biotechnology, D R Berry et al, eds, pp 401-429, Allen and Unwin, London) and by King et a/ (1989, Molecular and Cell Biology of Yeasts, E F Walton and G T Yarronton, eds, pp 107-133, Blackie, Glasgow). <br>
For several reasons Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited for heterologous gene expression. First, it is non-pathogenic to humans and it is incapable of producing certain endotoxins. Second, it has a long history of safe use following centuries of commercial exploitation for various purposes. This has led to wide public acceptability. Third, the extensive commercial use and research devoted to the organism has resulted in a wealth of knowledge about the genetics and physiology as well as large-scale fermentation characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <br>
A review of the principles of heterologous gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and secretion of gene products is given by E Hinchcliffe E Kenny (1993, "Yeast as a vehicle for the expression of heterologous genes", Yeasts, Vol 5, Anthony H Rose and J Stuart Harrison, eds, 2nd edition, Academic Press Ltd.). <br>
Several types of yeast vectors are available, including integrative vectors, which require recombination with the host genome for their maintenance, and autonomously replicating plasmid vectors. <br>
In order to prepare the transgenic Saccharomyces, expression constructs are prepared by inserting the nucleotide sequence into a construct designed for expression in yeast. <br>
Several types of constructs used for heterologous expression have been developed. <br>
The constructs contain a promoter active in yeast fused to the nucleotide sequence, usually a promoter of yeast origin, such as the GAL1 promoter, is used. Usually a signal sequence of yeast origin, such as the sequence encoding the SUC2 signal peptide, is used. A terminator active in yeast ends the expression system. <br>
For the transformation of yeast several transformation protocols have been developed. <br>
For example, a transgenic Saccharomyces according to the present invention can be prepared by following the teachings of Hinnen et al (1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 75, 1929); Beggs, J D (1978, Nature, London, 275, 104) ; and Ito, H et al (1983, J Bacteriology 153, 163-168). <br>
The transformed yeast cells are selected using various selective markers. Among the markers used for transformation are a number of auxotrophic markers such as LEU2, HIS4 and TRP1, and dominant antibiotic resistance markers such as aminoglycoside antibiotic markers, e. g. G418. <br>
Another host organism is a plant. The basic principle in the construction of genetically modified plants is to insert genetic information in the plant genome so as to obtain a stable maintenance of the inserted genetic material. Several techniques exist for inserting the genetic information, the two main principles being direct introduction of the genetic information and introduction of the genetic information by use of a vector system. A review of the general techniques may be found in articles by Potrykus (Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol [1991] 42 : 205-225) and Christou (Agro-Food-Industry Hi-Tech March/April 1994 17-27). Further teachings on plant transformation may be found in EP-A-0449375. <br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a method of transforming a host cell with a nucleotide sequence that is to be the target or is to express the target. Host cells transformed with the nucleotide sequence may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression of the encoded protein. The protein produced by a recombinant cell may be displayed on the surface of the cell. If desired, and as will be understood by those of skill in the art, expression vectors containing coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Other recombinant constructions may join the coding sequence to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins (Kroll DJ et al (1993) DNA Cell Biol 12: 441-53). <br>
VARIANTS/HOMOLOGUES/DERIVATIVES In addition to the specific amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences mentioned herein, the present invention also encompasses the use of variants, homologue and derivatives thereof. Here, the term"homology"can be equated with"identity". <br>
In the present context, an homologous sequence is taken to include an amino acid sequence which may be at least 75, 85 or 90% identical, preferably at least 95 or 98% identical. Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity (i. e. amino acid residues having similar chemical properties/functions), in the context of the present invention it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity. <br>
Homology comparisons can be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These commercially available computer programs can calculate % homology between two or more sequences. <br>
% homology may be'calculated over contiguous sequences, i. e. one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid in one sequence is directly compared with the corresponding amino acid in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is called an"ungapped"alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues. <br>
Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion will cause the following amino acid residues to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in % homology when a global alignment is performed. <br>
Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score. This is achieved by inserting"gaps"in the sequence alignment to try to maximise local homology. <br>
However, these more complex methods assign"gap penalties"to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible-reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences-will achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. "Affine gap costs"are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (see below) the default ap penalty for amino acid sequences is-12 for a gap and-4 for each extension. <br>
Calculation of maximum % horology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Besffit package (University of Wisconsin, U. S. A.; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12: 387). Examples of other software than can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid-Chapter 18), FASTA (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for off) and online searching (s&amp;commat;&amp;commat; Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. <br>
A further useful reference is that found in FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 May 15 ; 174 (2) : 247- 50 (and a published erratum appears in FEMS Microbio) Lett 1999 Aug 1 ; 177 (1) : 187-8). <br>
I Although the final % homology can be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pairwise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix-the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table if supplied (see user manual for further details). It is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62. <br>
Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate % homology, preferably % sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result. <br>
The sequences may also have deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acid residues which produce a silent change and result in a functionally equivalent substance. <br>
Deliberate amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues as long as the secondary binding activity of the substance is retained. For example, negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid ; positively charged amino acids include lysine and arginin ; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, alanine, asparagine, glutamin, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. <br>
Conservative substitutions may be made, for example according to the Table below. <br>
Amino acids in the same block in the second column and preferably in the same line in the third column may be substituted for each other: ALIPHATIC Non-polar G A P ILS Polar-uncharged C S T M N Q Polar-charged D E 19 Ft AROMATIC H F W Y l EXPRESSION VECTORS The nucleotide sequence for use as the target or for expressing the target can be incorporated into a recombinant repliable vector. The vector may be used to replicate and express the nucleotide sequence in and/or from a compatible host cell. Expression may be controlled using control sequences which include promoters/enhancers and other expression regulation signals. Prokaryotic promoters and promoters functional in eukaryotic cells may be used. Tissue specific or stimuli specific promoters may be used. <br>
Chimeric promoters may also be used comprising sequence elements from two or more different promoters described above. <br>
The protein produced by a host recombinant cell by expression of the nucleotide sequence may be secreted or may be contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. The coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the substance coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. <br>
FUSION PROTEINS The target amino acid sequence may be produced as a fusion protein, for example to aid in extraction and purification. Examples of fusion protein partners include glutathione-S- transferase (GST), 6xHis, GAL4 (DNA binding and/or transcriptional activation domains) and (-galaetosidase. It may also be convenient to include a proteolytic cleavage site between the fusion protein partner and the protein sequence of interest to allow removal of fusion protein sequences. Preferably the fusion protein will not hinder the activity of the target. <br>
The fusion protein may comprise an antigen or an antigenic determinant fused to the substance of the present invention. In this embodiment, the fusion protein may be d non-naturally occurring fusion protein comprising a substance which may act as an adjuvant in the sense of providing a generalised stimulation of the immune system.

THERAPY The compounds of the present invention may be used as therapeutic agents-i. e. in therapy applications. <br>
The term"therapy"includes curative effects, alleviation effects, and prophylactic effects. <br>
The therapy may be on humans or animals, preferably female animals. <br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS In one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound according to the present invention and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient (including combinations thereof). <br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and will typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Acceptabfe carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. <br>
1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and'standard pharmaceutical practice. <br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as-or in addition to-the carrier, <br><br><br> excipient or diluent any suitable binder (s), labricant (s), suspending agent (s), coating agent (s), solubilising agent (s). <br>

There may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes. <br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile. <br>
Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner. <br>

ADMINISTRATION Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The dosages below are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited. <br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered by direct injection. The composition may be formulated for parenteral, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous,- subcutaneous, intraocular or transdermal administration. Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0. 01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0. 1 to 10 m/kg, more preterablyfrom 0. 1 to 1 mg/kg body weight. <br>
By way of further example, the agents of the present invention may be administered in accordance with a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. <br>
The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing, therapy. <br>
Aside from the typical modes of delivery-indicated above-the term"administered" also includes delivery by techniques such as lipid mediated transfection, liposoms, immuholiposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial amphiphiles (CFAs) and combinations thereof.

Thus, for pharmaceutical administration, the STS inhibitors of the present invention can be formulated in any suitable manner utilising conventional pharmaceutical formulating techniques and pharmaceutical carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents etc. and usually for parenteral administration. Approximate effective dose rates may be in the range from 1 to 1000 mg/day, such as from 10 to 900 mg/day or even from 100 to 800 mg/day depending on the individual activities of the compounds in question and for a patient of average (70Kg) bodyweight. More usual dosage rates for the preferred and more active compounds will be in the range 200 to 800 mg/day, more preferably, 200 to 500 mg/day, most preferably from 200 to 250 mg/day. They may be given in single dose regimes, split dose regimes and/or in multiple dose regimes lasting over several days. For oral administration they may be formulated in tablets, capsules, solution or suspension containing from 100 to 500 mg of compound per unit dose. Alternatively and preferably the compounds will be formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable parenterally administrable carrier and providing single daily dosage rates in the range 200 to 800 mg, preferably 200 to 500, more preferably 200 to 250 mg. Such effective daily doses will, however, vary depending on inherent activity of the active ingredient and on the bodyweight of the patient, such variations being within the skill and judgement of the physician. <br>
CELL CYCLING The compounds of the present invention may be usedful in the method of treatment of a cell cycling disorder. <br>
As discussed in"Molecular Cell Biology"3rd, Ed. Lodish et al. pages 177-181 different eukaryotic cells can grow and divide at quite different rates. Yeast cells, for example, can divide every 120 min. , and the first divisions of fertilised eggs in the embryonic cells of sea urchins and insects take only 1530 min. because one large pre-existing cell is subdivided. However, most growing plant and animal cells take 10-20 hours to double in number, and some duplicate at a much slower rate. Many cells in adults, such as nerve cells and striated muscle cells, do not divide at all ; others, like the fibroblasts that assist in healing wounds, grow on demand but are otherwise quiescent. <br>
Still, every eukaryotic cell that divides must be ready to donate equal genetic material to two daughter cells. DNA synthesis in eukaryotes does not occur throughout the cell division cycle but is restricted to a part of it before cell division. <br>
The relationship between eukaryotic DNA synthesis and cell division has been thoroughly analysed in cultures of mammalian cells that were all capable of growth and division. In contrast to bacteria, it was found, eukaryotic cells spend only a part of their time in DNA synthesis, and it is completed hours before cell division (mitosis). Thus a gap of time occurs after DNA synthesis and before cell division ; another gap was found to occur after division and before the next round of DNA synthesis. This analysis led to the conclusion that the eukaryotic cell cycle consists of an M (mitotic) phase, a G, phase (the first gap), the S (DNA synthesis) phase, a G2 phase (the second gap), and back to M. The phases between mitoses (G1, S, and G2) are known collectively as the interphase. <br>
Many nondividing cells in tissues (for example, all quiescent fibroblasts) suspend the cycle after mitosis and just prior to DNA synthesis ; such"resting"cells are said to have exited from the cell cycle and to be in the Go state. <br>
It is possible to identify cells when they are in one of the three interphase stages of the cell cycle, by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to measure their relative DNA content: a cell that is in G1 (before DNA synthesis) has a defined amount x of DNA ; during S (DNA replication), it has between x and 2x; and when in G2 (or M), it has 2x of DNA. <br>
The stages of mitosis and cytokinesis in an animal cell are as follows (a) Interphase. The G2 stage of interphase immediately precedes the beginning of mitosis. Chromosomal DNA has been replicated and bound to protein during the S phase, but chromosomes are not yet seen as distinct structures. The nucleolus is the only nuclear substructure that is visible under light microscope. In a diploid cell before DNA replication there are two morphologic chromosomes of each type, and the cell is said to be 2n. In G2, after DNA replication, the cell is 4n. There are four copies of each chromosomal DNA. Since the sister chromosomes have not yet separated from each other, they are called sister chromatids. b) Early prophase. Centrioles, each with a newly formed daughter centriole, begin moving toward opposite poles of the cell ; the chromosomes can be seen as long threads. The nuclear membrane begins to disaggregate into small vesicles. <br>
(c) Middle and late prophase. Chromosome condensation is completed ; each visible chromosome structure is composed of two chromatids held together at their centromeres. Each chromatid contains one of the two newly replicated daughter DNA molecules. The microtubular spindle begins to radiate from the regions just adjacent to the centrioles, which are moving closer to their poles. Some spindle fibres reach from pole to pole ; most go to chromatids and attach at kinetochores. <br>
(d) Metaphase. The chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell, where they become aligned in the equatorial plane. The sister chromatids have not yet separated. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
<p>(e) Anaphase. The two sister chromatids separate into independent chromosomes. <br>
Each contains a centromere that is tinked by a spindfe fibre to one po) e, to which it moves. Thus one copy of each chromosome is donated to each daughter cell. <br>
Simultaneously, the cell elongates, as do the pole-to-pole spindles. Cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow starts to form. <br>
(f) Telophase. New membranes form around the daughter nuclei ; the chromosomes uncoil and become less distinct, the nucleolus becomes visible again, and the nuclear membrane forms around each daughter nucleus. Cytokinesis is nearly complete, and the Spindle disappears as the microtubules and other fibres depolymerise. <br>
Throughout mitosis the"daughter"centriole at each pole grows until it is full-length. At telophase. the duplication of each of the original centrioles is completed, and new daughter centrioles will be generated during the next interphase. <br>
(g) Interphase. Upon the completion of cytokinesis, the cell enters the G, phase of the cell cycle and proceeds again around the cycle. <br>
It will be appreciated that cell cycling is an extremely important cell process. Deviations from normal cell cycling can result in a number of medical disorders. Increased and/or unrestricted cell cycling may result in cancer. Reduced cell cycling may result in degenerative conditions. Use of the compound of the present invention may provide a means to treat such disorders and conditions. <br>
Thus, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for use in the treatment of cell cycling disorders such as cancers, including hormone dependent and hormone independent cancers. <br>
In addition, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for the treatment of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, sarcomas, melanomas, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer etc. and other solid tumours. <br>
For some applications, cell cycling is inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is prevented and/or arrested. In one aspect cell cycling may be inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested in the G2/M phase. In one aspect cell cycling may be irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is irreversibly prevented and/or arrested. <br>
By the term"irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested"it is meant after application of a compound of the present invention, on removal of the compound the effects of the compound, namely prevention and/or inhibition and/or arrest of cell cycling, are still observable. e. More particu) ar) y by the term"irreversibfy prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested"it is meant that when assayed in accordance with the cell cycling assay protocol presented herein, cells treated with a compound of interest show less growth after Stage 2 of the protocol I than control cells. Details on this protocol are presented below. <br>
Thus, the present'invention provides compounds which: cause inhibition of growth of oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) breast cancer cells in vitro by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling ; and/or cause regression of nitroso-methyl urea (NMU) -induced mammary tumours in intact animals (i. e. not ovariectomised), and/or prevent and/or inhibit and/or arrest cell cycling in cancer cells ; and/or act in vivo by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling and/or act as a cell cycling agonist. <br>
CELL CYCLING ASSAY (PROTOCOL 6) Procedure Stage 1 MCF-7 breast cancer cells are seeded into mufti-well culture plates at a density of 105 cells/well. Cells were allowed to attach and grown until about 30% confluent when they are treated as follows : Control-no treatment Compound of Interest (COI) 20FM Cells are grown for 6 days in growth medium containing the COI with changes of medium/COI every 3 days. At the end of this period cell numbers were counted using a Coulter cell counter. <br>
Stage 2 After treatment of cells for a 6-day period with the COI cells are re-seeded at a density of 104 cells/well. No further treatments are added. Cells are allowed to continue to grow for a further 6 days in the presence of growth medium. At the end of this period cell numbers are again counted. <br>
ASSAY FOR DETERMINING DH ACTIVITY USING CANCER CELLS (PROTOCOL 7) Conversion of oestrone to oestradiol (E1 o E2, E2DH Type I) and oestradiol to oestrone (E2 E1, E2DH Type II) was measured in intact cell monolayers of T47D and MDA- MB-231 breast cancer cells respectively. Cells were cultured in flasks until they were 80-90% confluent. 3H-E1 or 3H-E2 (6pmol, 90 Ci/mmol) were added to each flask in the absence (control) or presence of various test compounds (10FM) in 2. 5ml of medium. Substrate was also added to flasks without cells and incubated in parallel (blanks). <br>
After incubation with T47D cells for 30min or MDA cells for 3h at 37°C, 2ml of the medium was added to test tubes containing 14C-E2 or 14C-E1 (#5000 cpm) and 50ug E2 or E1 respectively. Steroids were extracted from the aqueous medium with diethyl ether (4ml). The ether phase was decanted into separate tubes after freezing the aqueous phase in solid carbon dioxide-methanol mixture. The ether was evaporated to dryness under a stream of air at 40°C. The residue was dissolved in a small volume of diethyl ether and applied to TLC plates containing a fluorescent indicator. E1 and E2 were separated by TLC using DCM-Ethyl acetate (4: 1 v/v). The position of the product from each incubation flask was marked on the TLC plate after visualisation under UV light. <br>
The marked regions were cut out and placed in scintillation vials containing methanol (0. 5ml) to elute the product. The amount of 3H-product formed and"C-El or"C-E2 recovered were calculated after scintillation spectrometry. The amount of product formed was corrected for procedural losses and for the number of cells in each flask. <br>
CANCER As indicated, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of a cell cycling disorder. A particular cell cycling disorder is cancer. <br>
Cancer remains a major cause of mortality in most Western countries. Cancer therapies developed so far have included blocking the action or synthesis of hormones to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent tumours. However, more aggressive chemotherapy is currently employed for the treatment of hormone-independent tumours. <br>
Hence, the development of a pharmaceutical for anti-cancer treatment of hormone dependent and/or hormone independent tumours, yet lacking some or all of the side- effects associated with chemotherapy, would represent a major therapeutic advance. <br>
It is known that oestrogens undergo a number of hydroxylation and conjugation reactions after their synthesis. Until recently it was thought that such reactions were part of a metabolic process that ultimately rendered oestrogens water soluble and enhanced their elimination from the body. It is now evident that some hydroxy metabolites (e. g. 2- hydroxy and 16alpha-hydroxy) and conjugates (e. g. oestrone sulphate, E1S) are important in determining some of the complex actions that oestrogens have in the body. <br>
Workers have investigated the formation of 2-and 16-hydroxylated oestrogens in relation to conditions that alter the risk of breast cancer. There is now evidence that factors which increase 2-hydroxylase activity are associated with a reduced cancer risk, while those increasing 16alpha-hydroxylation may enhance the risk of breast cancer. <br>
Further interest in the biological role of oestrogen metabolites has been stimulated by the growing body of evidence that 2-methoxyoestradiol is an endogenous metabolite with anti-mitotic properties. 2-MeOE2 is formed from 2-hydroxy oestradiol (2-OHE2) by catechol oestrogen methyl transferase, an enzyme that is widely distributed throughout the body. <br>
Workers have shown that in vivo 2-MeOE2 inhibits the growth of tumours arising from the subcutaneous injection of Meth A sarcoma, B16 melanoma or MDA-MB-435 oestrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cells. It also inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and in vitro angiogenesis. It was suggested that the ability of 2-MeOE2 to inhibit tumour growth in vivo may be due to its ability to inhibit tumour- induced angiogenesis rather than direct inhibition of the proliferation of tumour cells. <br>
The mechanism by which 2-MeOE2 exerts its potent anti-mitogenic and anti-angiogenic effects is still being elucidated. There is evidence that at high concentrations it can inhibit microtubule polymerisation and act as a weak inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin. Recently, however, at concentrations that block mitosis, tubulin filaments in cells were not found to be depolymerised but to have an identical morphology to that seen after taxon treatment. It is possible, therefore, that liies ta, a drug that is used for breast and ovarian breast cancer therapy, 2-MeOE2 acts by stabilising microtubule dynamics. <br>
While the identification of 2-MeOE2 as a new therapy for cancer represents an important advance, the bioavailability of orally administered oestrogens is poor. Furthermore, they can undergo extensive metabolism during their first pass through the liver. As part of a research programme to develop a steroid sulphate inhibitor for breast cancer therapy, oestrone-3-O-sulphamate (EMATE) was identified as a potent active site-directed inhibitor. Unexpectedly, EMATE proved to possess potent oestrogenic properties with its oral uterotrophic activity in rats being a 100-times higher than that of oestradiol. Its enhanced oestrogenicity is thought to result from its absorption by red blood cells (rbcs) which protects it from inactivation during its passage through the liver and which act as a reservoir for its slow release for a prolonged period of time. A number of A-ring modified analogues were synthesised and tested, including 2-methoxyoestrone-3-0-sulphamate. <br>
While this compound was equipotent with EMATE as a steroid sulphate inhibitor, it was devoid of oestrogenicity. <br>
We believe that the compound of the present invention provides a means for the treatment of cancers and, especially, breast cancer. <br>
In addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in the blocking the growth of cancers including leukaemias and solid tumours such as breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and pancreatic tumours. <br>
THERAPY CONCERNING OESTROGEN We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the control of oestrogen levels in the body-in particular in females. Thus, some of the compounds may be useful as providing a means of fertility control-such as an oral contraceptive tablet, pill, solution or lozenge. Alternatively, the compound could be in the form of an implant or as a patch. <br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal conditions associated with oestrogen. <br>
In addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal conditions in addition to those associated with oestrogen. Hence, the compound of the present invention may also be capable of affecting hormonal activity and may also be capable of affecting an immune response. <br>
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of neurodenerative diseases, and similar conditions. <br>
By way of example, it is believed that STS inhibitors may be useful in the enhancing the memory function of patients suffering from illnesses such as amnesia, head injuries, Alzheimer's disease, epileptic dementia, presenile dementia, post traumatic dementia, senile dementia, vascular dementia and post-stroke dementia or individuals otherwise seeking memory enhancement. <br>
TH1 We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in TH1 implications. <br>
By way of example, it is believed that the presence of STS inhibitors within the macrophage or other <br><br><br>
antigen presenting cells may lead to a decreased ability of sensitised T cells to mount a TH1 (high IL-2, IFNy low IL-4) response. The normal regulatory influence of other steroids such as glucocorticoids would therefore predominate. <br>
INFLAMATORY CONDITIONS We believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating inflammatory conditions-such as conditions associated with any one or more of: autoimmunity, including for example, rheumatoid arthritis, type I and 11 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, thyroiditis, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, skin disorders e. g. psoriasis and contact dermatitis ; graft versus host disease ; eczema ; asthma and organ rejection following transplantation. <br>
By way of exampie, it is believed that STS inhibitors may prevent the normai physiological effect of DHEA or related steroids on immune and/or inflammatory responses. <br>
The compounds of the present invention may be useful in the manufacture of a medicament for revealing an endogenous glucocorticoid-like effect. <br>
OTHER THERAPIE It is also to be understood that the compound/composition of the present invention may have other important medical implications. <br>

SULPHAMATE COMPOUND PREPARATION The sulphate compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an appropriate alcohol with a suitable chloride. By way of example, the sulphate compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an appropriate alcohol with a suitable sulfamoyl chloride, of the formula R9R'°NS02CI. <br>
Typical conditions for carrying out the reaction are as follows. <br>
Sodium hydride and a'sulfamoyl chloride are added to a stirred solution of the alcohol in anhydrous dimethyl formamide at 0°C.

During this time the starting material dissolved then another white precipitate formed. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature, acidified with glacial acetic acid and water was added to ensure that all product precipitated. The white powder was collected by filtration and washed with water, a small amount of ethanol, diethyl ether and hexane. LCMS showed two compounds with masses corresponding to the desired product (312) and the hydrazone derivative of estrone (285). Flash chromatography using 10% methanol in DCM to 100% methanol failed to separate these. Recrystallisation was attempted by suspending the solid in ethanol then slowly adding aqueous NaOH until the solid dissolved, followed by acidification to pH3 with glacial acetic acid. No precipitate formed initially therefore a small amount of water was added until a fine white powder precipitated. This was shown by LCMS and HPLC to be the desired product.

General procedure for amide coupling on resin-bound starting material : To the loaded resin (0.200 g) swollen in dry DCM (3 cm3) under N2 was added bromo- tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP, 0.260 g, 0. 5 mmol) and N- hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt, 0. 070 g, 0. 5 mmol) followed by DIPEA (0. 18 cm3, 1. 0 mmol). The mixture was shaken for 10 min before addition of amine (0.06 cm3) and shaking under N2 at d was continued for 72 h. The resin was collected in a fritted syringe and washed with DMF, DCM and MeOH (x3) and again with DCM (x3) before cleavage of the product using TFA/DCM (1/1). Purification by flash chromatography (Flashmaster II) using a gradient elution of DCM to 10% MeOH in DCM yielded the sulfamate in yields of 1-53% and HPLC purities of 88-98%. <br>

The remaining half was treated with 50% TFA in DCM over 20 min., TFA was evaporated using the Genevac and the products were purified using Flash Master-11 (DCM/MeOH, gradient elution, 5 or 10 g pre-packed columns) to generate the sulfamate library. The compounds generated exist as a mixture of diastereomers. <br>
General procedure for synthesis of phenol library. <br>
The resin bound sulfamate amides (0.200 g, 0. 86 mmol/g) were suspended in anhydrous THF (4 ml) under inert atmosphere (Radleys Green House Parallel Synthesiser was used to carry out these reactions), treated with piperazine (0.75 g, 8.7 mmol) and refluxed at 70 °C for approximately 70 h. The resins were filtered, the filtrates were collected in to tubes, concentrated using the Genevac. These compounds were pre-absorbed onto silica gel, purified using the Flash Master-11 (Ethyl acetate/Hexane gradient elution) to give pure products as colourless solids. These compounds exist as a mixture of diastereomers.

SECTION 6 General procedure for debenzylation of protected phenol intermediates using a Radleys GreenHouse synthesiser. <br>
Starting materials were dissolved/suspended in THF (1 cm3) and to each suspension was added ethanol (1cm3). Each suspension was degassed by bubbling nitrogen through for a few minutes before Pd/C (5% wt., catalytic) was added and each solution/suspension was degassed for a further few minutes. Hydrogen gas (balloon) was then passed over the reactions and they were stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 24h.'H NMR of one of the reactions at this stage showed that the debenzylation had not gone to completion therefore all were degassed again and more Pd added, followed by stirring under hydrogen for a further 21h. Each reaction was then filtered through celite and the celite washed with ethyl acetate and methanol. The solutions were concentrated in vacuo and the products purified by flash chromatography. <br>
