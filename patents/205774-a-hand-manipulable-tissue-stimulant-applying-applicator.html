"A HAND-BOANPULABLE, TISSUE STIMULANT<br>
/<br>
APPLYING APPLICATOR"<br>
40 J'S LLC, OF 110 Stanberiy Ridge, Ft. Thomas, KY  14075, United States of America,<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The  present   invention  relates  to   a  hand-manipulable,   tissue stimulant-applying applicator.<br><br><br>
Background of  the-Invetion<br>
Frerd of the-Invehtion <br>
us inventioa relates to arrangements for the stimulation of femal'e tissue and more particularly to topical application of specialized stimulatory medicaments for the lips or the clitoris of human females..<br>
Prior Art<br>
The unique properties of the clitoral sensitizing compounds encompasses the vasodilatation of clitoral blood vessels by the initial effect of menthol to facilitate and promote the absorption of L-arginihe when topically applied to the mucous membrane of the clitoris.  The L-arginine stimulates the nitric oxide synthase mediated production of nitric oxide to effect clitoral sensitivity, arousal, and erection by sustained vasodilatation.  Both of these actions are specific to the topical application of the compound to the mucous membrane of the clitoris and presume an inert, non-active base or vehicle. In the menmol/L-arginine compound, the menthol actually acts as a vehicle to enhance the absorption of L-arginine. •<br>
In the human female, decreased clitoral sensitivity and responsiveness are related to normal aging, relative or absolute estrogen and testosterone deficiency (either, as j.. consequence of medicines or aging), and by a host of vascular conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.  Multiple laboratory and clinical research endeavors have been directed toward male erectile dysfunction (ED), yielding not only an understanding of the erection physiology, but also medications to treat ED, such as Viagra™. Very little research has been initiated to understand or address female physiological sexual unresponsiveness.  However, since the penis and the clitoris are analogous anatomical structures, the basic cellular and physiological knowledge about male penile erections translates to functions of the :Iitoris.<br>
Female clitoral dysfunction is extremely difficult to document and quantify.  A number of modalities, such as Doppler blood flow, precise temperature rteasurements, and actual imaging measurements, have been employed to attempt to<br><br>
define clitoral responsiveness - all with results unsatisfactory for meaningful research.   Estimates that 15 million U.S. men suffer from erectile dysfunction have been reported in the literature.  A recent article in the February 10, 1999 issue of ~the journal of the American-Medical~Association suggests. that female erectile dysfunction occurs probably twice the" rate of male ED, therefore affecting 30 million U.S. women.<br>
In the female, anatomy, the clitoral artery is located in the middle of the clitoris, extending lengthwise from the base to the tip of the clitoris, and • supplies blood to the clitoris.   Two clitoral veins are located on either side of the clitoral artery, and normally drain the clitoris of the blood pumped into it from the artery.  As female sexual arousal initiates, either by direct stimulation of the clitoris or by the application of one of the recently developed female arousal creams, the vessels dilate and the valves of the clitoral veins located at the base of the clitoris close.   The venous blood fills two honeycomb-like chambers, the corpus cavernosa. The corpus cavernosa are normally empty of blood, but, like the clitoral artery and veins, they are positioned lengthwise from the base to the tip of the clitoris. Therefore, as the valves in the veins at the base of the clitoris close, the blood pumped into the clitoris artery distends the corpus cavernosa.  This causes the clitoris to enlarge two-to-three fold, and to become erect, rigid, and highly sensitive, just as the penis in the male.  In fact, the penis and the clitoris are the exact same structures.   Female clitoral enlargement and rigidity and male penile erection are both accomplished by the same action:  vasodilation of the vascular structures maximally distending the corpus cavernosa.<br>
Topical application of medications to different types of Integument (skin) to effect changes in sensation are based upon that type of integument.. There are two types of integument (skin):  keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, and non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, more commonly referred to. as mucous membrane.   The entire external surface of the body is covered with keratinized stratified squamous epithelium except the lips, mouth, anus, and the vagina/vulva in females.   If a lotion is applied to the keratinized squamous epithelium, it is absorbed only by the top layers of the skin.  Multiple transdermal medications are delivered through the keratinized skin, but the delivery system is<br><br>
very sophisticated.  Absorption of medications is much easier if they are delivered to mucous membranes, or non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, especially the lips, the vulva and vaginal mucosa.  Many vaginal creams and suppositories that dissolve to become creams with-the'moisture.and-heat of the -vagina have been.sold, for over fifty years.   All of the vaginal creams and suppositories are absorbed into full thickness of the non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that defines the vaginal mucosa.  Some of the vaginal creams are systenucally absorbed by the blood vessels in the basement membrane of the vaginal mucosa, while other medications are not systemically absorbed.  Systemic absorption refers to the distribution of the medication throughout all tissues of the body via the blood stream.   The vaginal/vulvar mucosa is a multiple layer of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelial cells rwenty-to-tbirty cells in thickness from the basement membrane to the outermost cells of the mucosa.<br>
The integument of the undercarriage of the clitoris is non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (mucous membrane), and topical medications are readily absorbed.  The clitoral hood that covers the dorsal aspect of the clitoris is partially keratinized, and allows partial absorption of topical medications.   The integument of the penis is keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  Absorption of the same medication topically applied to the penis and the clitoris concurrently will be much more readily absorbed by the clitoris because of the mucous membrane of the clitoris.<br>
Topical menthol is a particular tissue or clitoral sensitizing agent and may be applied to clitoral tissue and may have a number of effects.  The specific effects that menthol causes are dependent upon three variables:   the concentration of the menthol in the preparation, the vehicle and its evaporation properties, and most importantly, the type of tissue to which the menthol is applied.   If the menthol is in a non-evaporating vehicle and applied to keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (hairy skin), a low concentration is under 1%, a mid-range concentration, l%-5%, and a high concentration, between 5% and 10%.  If menthol in a non-evaporating vehicle is applied to non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (mucous, membrane), a low concentration is less than 0.5%, a mid-range concentration between 0.5% and 2%, and a high concentration between 2% and 5%.   Therefore, a<br><br>
1 % concentration of menthol in a non-evaporating vehicle applied to keratinized and non-keratinized epithelium would produce very different effects:   the keratinized epithelium would respond with a minimal effect, while the non-keratinized epitheliurn would respond with amarked-effect.- This isJbecause of .the.jrapid_ 5      absorption through .the non-keratinized epithelium, (mucous membrane) and the relatively poor absorption through the barrier-like keratinized epithelium (hairy skin).<br>
Menthol is highly lipid-soluble and readily absorbed by a mucous membrane.   A mid-range concentration of 0.5% to 2% of menthol topically applied 10     to mucous membrane causes almost immediate smooth muscle relaxation,<br>
hyperemia, and vasodilation of blood vessels by a direct response.   Menthol also causes the, immediate stimulation of both thermoreceptors and nociceptors.  The thermoreceptors, when stimulated, create a sensation of warmth and burning for this menthol concentration in mucous membrane (like the clitoris).   The nociceptors 15     initiate an axon reflex to release vasodilator peptides.  The vasodilator peptides<br>
cause an immediate vasodilation of blood vessels with resultant blood engorgement and transudate production.  The sera component of the blood that leaks out of the blood vessels to provide increased vaginal/vulvar lubrication is due to the nociceptor initiated vasodilation.  The onset of all of these mechanisms occurs within thirty 20     seconds of application of the menthol preparation, and these responses persist for fifteen-to-twenty minutes.  Therefore, the topical application of a 1% menthol., preparation, in a non-evaporating vehicle directly to the mucous membrane of the clitoris, causes the following physiological responses:   a. warmth, tingling, and even mild burning;  b. hyperemia;  c. direct smooth muscle relaxation;  d. indirect blood 25     engorgement via nociceptor-roediated vasodilation by peptide release; and  e. increased vulvar/vaginal lubrication.<br>
Topical L-arginine is a clitoral sensitizing agent, produced from intracellular nitric acid (NO), which is a potent vasodilator of smooth muscles, and has been identified and confirmed by a number of research studies to be pivotally 30     involved in penile/clitoral erections.  Nitric oxide is synthesized from the substrate L-arginine in a cellular reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS).  Two different types of NOS have been identified:   eNOS and nNOS.   The eNOS is<br><br>
contained with the smooth muscle.endothelial cells that line the vasculature of the penis/clitoris.  As the available L-arginine is concerted into NO by eNOS, the blood vessels and corpus cavernosa of the penis/clitoris dilate and fill with blood.  This engorgemenrof the"penis/clitorisis'the"mechanisrnforthe erection-and rigidity of the aroused penis/clitoris.   The nNOS is contained within the nerve cells of the penis/clitoris and converts L-arginine into NO to sensitize the penis/clitoris and cause the release of vasodilation peptide.  Burnett, et al. reported in "Immunohistocheinical Description of Nitric Oxide Synthase Isoforms in Human Clitoris", Journal of Urology, July 1997, 75-79, that the vascular and neuronal alteration of the penis/clitbris that create an erection are the direct effect of the ability of the cells to convert the available L-arginine into nitric oxide through nitric oxide synthase.<br>
Several urologic and gynecologic reports have identified a correlation between a decreased availability or activity of the NO,synthase system and normal aging, testosterone deficiency, and estrogen deficiency.   The studies confirm that an increase in the supply of the substrate L-arginine allows the attenuated but still functional NOS system to affect the nitric oxide medicated erection of the penis/clitoris. .Therefore, the topical application of L-arginine via the NOS system causes vasodilation of the penile/clitoral veinous .structures and concomitant , sensitivity.  The safety^of 1% of 2% menthol.topically applied to tissue such as the clitoris is a consideration.  Two different strengths of menthol may be commercialized, such as 1% and 2% concentrations in a non-evaporating water base.  The anticipated normal volume of such cream to be applied to the clitoris is 300 mg.   Therefore, the maximum amount of menthol delivered is 6 mg.   The Extra Pharmacopoeia, MartindaJe, 1989, reports menthol toxicity for humans at 28 mg./kg.   In a 50 kg individual, the toxic dose could be 1400 mg., but this is estimated to be extremely low by Eccles in his "Review:  Menthol and Other Cooling Compounds" in the 1994 Journal of Pharmacological Pharmacopedia, volume 46, pages 618-630.  A 6 mg. dose of menthol is well below the 1400 mg. dose calculated and gives a 100 plus fold margin of safety.<br>
The safety of L-arginine topically applied to tissue such as the clitoris is also a consideration.  Two different strengths, of L-arginine USP, 2% and 4%,<br><br>
may be marketed so as to sensitize the clitoris. . The anticipated normal volume of such cream to beapplied to the clitoris is 300 mg.   Therefore, a maximum of 12 mg. of L-arginine USP is available.   If all 12 mg. are systemically. absorbed, this is a "small fraction of what-has-been-reported.in the .gynecologic literature as safe. Fracchinette, et al., reported the intravenous infusion of 30 grams (30,000 milligrams) of L-arginine into 29 pregnant patients without adverse effects in the 1999 Journal of the. Society of Gynecologic Investigation, volume 6,202-207.<br>
botanical or<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to alternate preparations of menthol and<br>
related cooling compounds that comprises a class of single-source 0<br>
essential oilsjthat can be used individually or as a combination of several oils such<br>
as:   Peppermint oil; Commint oil; Eucalyptus oil; Citronella oil; Indian turpentine<br>
oil; Camphor oil and Cinnamon oil.	'	.<br>
In fact, all of the botanicals listed by Steinberg 'in "Frequency Use of Botanicals," in Cosmetics and Toiletries magazine, Volume 113, October, 1998, (incorporated herein by reference) are members of this class of single-source botanical or essential oils.  Potentially, any of these referenced oils could evoke the menthol-like effect on the mucous membrane to facilitate or promote the topical absorption of L-arginine.  In addition, known minor skin irritants can cause a profound reaction when topically applied to mucous membrane, such as redness, irritation, and reflex vasodilatation.   This irritant reaction associated with vasodilatation shares some similarities with the menthol effect, and could quite effectively substitute for the menthol in promoting L-arginine absorption and actions.   Salicylate and capsiatin are two of the commonly1 used minor skin irritants. Oil soluble vitamins (coenzymes) A, D, or E, could also potentiate absorption of menthol, L-arginine, minor skin irritants, or any of the menthol-related cooling compounds.  The oil soluble vitamins could be used to substitute for, or be used in addition to, any of the previously listed components in a topical clitoral sensitizing preparation.<br>
The invention may further comprise alternate preparations for the base or the vehicle.  Such biologically active agents (menthol or its substitutes) and L-arginine can be compounded in a non-biologically active base, or in a biologically<br><br>
active base that promotes absorption, a vehicle.  Any base or vehicle is intended to liquefy at body heat and in the presence of moisture present in mucous membrane when topically applied to mucous membrane tissue.  Campos and Eccleston is —Vitamin-A-Skin.Renefration Cosmetics and Toiletries magazine, volume 113,<br>
5      July, 1998, describe and quantify how different vehicles influence and promote the hairy skin (keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) absorption of Vitamin A. Mucous membranes absorb solutions more readily than hairy skin, but display linear absorption potentials relative to the vehicles studies by Campos and Eccleston.   An active vehicle may be engineered that synergistically functions to promote the 10     absorption and actions of menthol, menthol-related compounds, biologically derived oils, minor skin irritants, oil soluble vitamins, L-arginine, or any combination of these.<br>
There are solid/liquid state dynamics for the topical delivery of clitoral sensitizing compounds which cover any of the potential compounds for 15      topical application to sensitize tissues such as the clitoris because they can have<br>
different solid/liquid states at ambient and at body temperatures.  A solid compound, such as exemplified by the Chap Stick® Lip Balm, A. H. Robbins Company, of Richmond, Virginia, could be directly applied to the undercarriage of the clitoris, and liquefy at body temperature and in the moisture inherent in mucous membrane 20     tissue.  Liquefied compounds are readily absorbed, dependent on various other<br>
factors described.   A gel/cream or liquid compound could be directly applied to the clitoris for topical absorption.  Like the solid-state compound, the gel/cream must liquefy before absorption can be effected.  The dynamics of how rapidly a compound transforms from a solid state or gel/cream state to a liquid state could be 25     controlled to evoke an almost immediate effect, or a relatively delayed effect, before absorption of the compound.<br>
A crystalline related dissolution may be different from the temperature related dissolution of a solid or a gel/cream.   Small crystals of menthol, L-arginine, or any of the previously described components, may be suspended in a 30     base vehicle.   Their availability for absorption would depend on their dissolution from a crystalline state to a liquid state.  The crystalline effect may be designed to control the rate of absorption:   for instance, whether the compound were available<br><br>
for absorption immediately on application, or if a delayed, sustained absorption over<br>
a period of time were desired.   Both of these parameters could allow the discrete,<br>
private Application of the clitoral-sensitizing compound in anticipation of<br>
intercourse,- without- knowledge -of. the partner.	<br>
Because the clitoral-sensitizing compounds are also intended to function independently without the preferred intercourse-related physical, stimulation of the cljtoris, the menthpl/L-arginine compounds may. also be arranged to be available in various strength to address the needs of all women.   The menthol may be compounded in multiple strengths, ranging.from 0.1% to 5%, and any increment in between,   The  L -arginine may also be compounded in multiple strengths ranging from 1% to 10%.  The spectrum of different strengths may be compounded into a single delivery system, such as lip balm, or alternatively, in all of the potential delivery systems:  solid, gel/cream, and liquid.<br>
A single use or a multiple use delivery systems comprising clitoral-<br>
sensitizirig preparations may be individually packaged within a small rube or packet<br>
for singly use  Conversely, a multiple-dose reusable delivery system, like a tube of<br>
hand cream or toothpaste, or a stick of lip balm, may be packaged for personal use.<br>
The apparatus and methods to deliver a topical preparation to the lips<br>
l<br>
or the clioris may be comprised of a solid or semi-solid compound that may be directly applied to the undercarriage of the clitoris regardless of the use of a single or multiple-use delivery system.   The clitoral contact area of the solid or semi-solicj compound in one preferred embodiment will have a notch to increase the surface area and clitoral contact of the compound.  The notch is arranged with a height of 0.5 to. 2 centimeters, and a maximum width of 2 centimeters at the rim of the notch,  A properly designed concave notch will topically apply the compound to the 180 degree undercarriage of the clitoris.  With proper directions for use, the application surface will initially contact the vestibular tissue at the base of the clitoris, to spread the compound on the entire clitoris.<br>
A gel/cream or liquid compound would be applied to the tissue or chtons with the same motions, but would require a different type of application device.  The gel/cream or liquid could be applied by "roller balls" like those used to apply viscdus deodorants, by a sponge-type applicator, or by a brush type of system.<br><br>
Any of the delivery devices for gel/cream or liquids could.be designed to increase the surface area of the applicator tip and generally use the concave notch described for the solid'compounds.   The-gel/cream and liquid applicators would have either a singie-use~res"efvoir or a mult usereservoir.- All of the delivery-devices would have 5     a cap that would seal the device before the initial use, and protect the applicator tip from contamination before use.  Multi-use devices would have a reseaJing cap.<br>
The invention thus comprises a hand-manipulable, tissue or clitoral<br>
stimulant-applying applicator for use to apply a clitoral stimulating compound to the<br>
clitoral area of the human female, comprising:  a reservoir for containment of a<br>
10     clitoral stimulating compound; a clitoral stimulating compound in said reservoir; and<br>
a removable cover on the reservoir to expose the compound to permit said<br>
compound to be applied topically.  The cover may comprise a removable cap.  The<br>
reservoir may comprise a rube and said cover.  The compound may comprise a gel.<br>
The compound may comprise a cream.  The compound may comprise a fluid liquid.<br>
15      The compound may comprise a semi-solid.  The semi-solid compound may have a<br>
notch on its distalmost end to facilitate the application of the compound.  The<br>
applicator may include a brush thereon.  The applicator may include a sponge<br>
thereon.  The applicator may include a roller ball arrangement thereon.  The<br>
compound may be comprised of a mixture of menthol and L-arginine.  The<br>
20     compound may have components selected from the group consisting of:  Peppermint<br>
oil, Cornmint oil. Eucalyptus oil, Citronella oil, Indian.turpentine oil, Camphor oil<br>
and Cinnamon oils.  The compound may have components selected from the group<br>
consisting of:   Salicylate, capsiatin, and oil soluble vitamins (co-enzymes) of A, D,<br>
or E.<br>
25	The invention may also include a method of sensitizing the tissue or<br>
clitoris of a human female, comprising the steps of:  applying a compound of sensitizing agent to the tissue or clitoris; and selecting a component of said sensitizing agent from the group consisting of:  Peppermint oil, Cornmint oil, Eucalyptus oil, Citronella oil, Indian turpentine oil, Camphor oil, Cinnamon oils, 30     Salicylate, capsiatin, and oil soluble vitamins (co-enzymes) of A, D, or E.   The steps may include placing the sensitizing agent in a reservoir of an applicator; arranging a cover on the. applicator to protect the agent in the reservoir.  The<br><br>
applicator may include a brush.   The applicator may include a roller at one end thereof.  The applicator may include a sponge at one end thereof.  The sensitizing agent comprises a semi-solid stick having a "V" notch on a distal end thereof to<br>
facilitate application of  The ageht  to" the"ussuesuch-as-a-clitoriS;-	-	.   . .<br>
5	Further unique properties of a combination menthol/L-arginine topical<br>
clitoral sensitizing preparation provides the basis of the present~invenatiin	*<br>
Sequential application first by menthol'applied topically to the mucous membrane of the clitoris has an almost immediate response by affecting vasodilation and blood engorgement warmth (via the thermoreceptors).   The duration of menthol's action 10      on mucous membranes may be for fifteen-to-twenty minutes.   Subsequent topical application of L-arginine utilizes its topical or systemic effect, via the NOS synthase/NO system, to create corpus cavernosa engorgement, which has a delayed onset of action from between fifteen to twenty minutes.  By combining the two compounds, with simultaneous topical application of menthol and L-arginine, their 15      effect would be immediate and prolonged because of their two different, but related, methods of action.<br>
L-arginine absorption is promoted by the actions of menthol.  Eccles reports studies by Katayama (1972), Morimoto (1993) and Yamo (1991) where;the topical application of menthol, because of its local vasodilatative and lipidphilhc 20     properties, promotes the penetration of other topical drug preparation applied<br>
concurrently.withmenthol.   These studies found rapid absorption of indomethacin, cortisone, morphine hydrochloride, and methyl salicylate when applied topically in combination with menthol.  It is only rational that the absorption of L-arginine by the mucous membrane is hastened when applied in combination with menthol.  This 25      is a direct action of the lipidpbillic and vasodilation properties of menthol.   The<br>
action of menthol causes the L-arginine NOS/NO vasodilation to be effective within minutes of the topical application of the mehthol/L-arginine combination.<br>
A different effect is realized on the clitoris and the penis using the same menthol/L-arginine combination.  This is because the integument of the 30      clitoris is non-keratinized epithelium, a 1% menthol and 2% L-arginine preparation, topically applied, is immediately absorbed, and immediately active in sensitizing the clitoris.  The penis is relatively unaffected by the application of the same strength<br><br>
cream because the external epithelium is keratinized squamous epithelium.  The keratinized squamous epithelium, by nature of the keratin, acts as a barrier to the absorption of the preparation.   Therefore, the same preparation of 1% menthol and - -2%-LTarginme-combmatipn-sensitizes the clitories, without sensitizing the penis.<br>
The invention thus comprises a topical compound preparation of sensitizing cream for application to the non-keratinized epithelium of a female, comprising a preparation of L-arginine, and a preparation of menthol.  The preparation of L-arginine may have a concentration of 4% or less.   The preparation of menthol may have a concentration of 5% or less.   The preparation of L-arginine may in one embodiment have a concentration of 2% and the preparation of menthol may have a concentration of 1%.<br>
The compound preparation may in one embodiment be enclosed within a reservoir of an applicator.  The reservoir may have multiple chambers. The reservoir may have an arrangement of conduits from the reservoir to an outer clitoral-touching surface on the applicator.  The invention also includes a method of sensitizing the non-keratinized epithelium of a female, comprising the steps of: applying a preparation of menthol and L-arginine to the epithelium, arranging the preparation of L-arginine in a concentration of less than 4%; and arranging the preparation of menthol in a concentration of less than 5%.   The method may include the step of:  placing the preparations of menthol and L-arginine in an applicator reservoir for distribution onto the epithelium, and may include the step of applying the preparations to the epithelium in a sequential manner.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments Referring now to the invention and the drawings in detail, alternate preparations of menthol and related cooling compounds comprises a class of single-source of botanical or essential oils that can be used individually or as a 15      combination of several oils such as:  Peppermint oil; Commint oil; Eucalyptus oil; Citronella oil; Indian turpentine oil; Camphor oil and Cinnamon oils, as compounds of the present invention.  Any of these referenced oils could evoke the menthol-like effect on the mucous membrane to facilitate or promote the topical absorption of L-arginine.  Salicylate and capsiatin, two commonly used minor skin irritants and 20     oil soluble vitamins (co-enzymes) A, D, or E, could also potentiate absorption of menthol, L-arginine, minor skin irritants, or any of the menthol-related cooling compounds.  The oil soluble vitamins could be used to substitute for, or be used in addition to, any of the previously listed components in a topical tissue or clitoral sensitizing preparation.   Such solid/liquid state dynamics for the topical delivery of 25     tissue or clitoral sensitizing compounds which cover any of the potential compounds for topical application to sensitize the tissue of lips or the clitoris because they can have different solid/liquid states at ambient and at body temperatures.<br>
A gel/cream or liquid compound could be directly applied to the tissue or clitoris for topical absorption.   Like the solid-state compound, the 30     gel/cream must liquefy before absorption can be effected.  The dynamics of how rapidly a compound transforms from a solid state or gel/cream state to a liquid state could be controlled to evoke an almost immediate effect, or a relatively delayed<br><br>
eilect, before absorption of the compound.<br>
A crystalline related dissolution may be different from the temperature related dissolution of a solid or a gel/cream.   Small crystals of menthol, L-arginirie, any of the'previously-described components,- may be suspended in a. 5      base vehicle.   Their availability for absorption would depend on their dissolution from a crystalline state to a liquid state.   The crystalline effect may be designed to control the rate of absorption:  for instance, whether the compound were available for absorption immediately on application, or if a delayed, sustained absorption over a period of time were desired.  Both of these parameters could allow the discrete, 10      private application of the clitoral-sensitizing compound in anticipation of intercourse, Without knowledge of the partner.<br>
A single use or a multiple use delivery systems comprising a tissue or clitoral-sensitizing preparation 10 may be individually packaged within a small tube 12 or packet 14 for single use, as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 5.   The tube 12 may be 15     gripped by the thumb and first finger, and the compound preparation thereon applied as desired.<br>
The packet 14 shown in Figure 5 has a break-away seal 15 which permits the gel/cream or liquid 10 therein to be readily applied by merely squeezing the packet 14.   Conversely, a multiple-dose reusable delivery system, like a tube of 20      hand cream or toothpaste, or a stick of semi-solid compound, tissue such as lips or clitoral-sensitizing balm 16, may be packaged for personal use, as shown by the "lipstick-like" rotatively adjustable applicators 18 in Figures 3 and 4.  This adjustable applicator 18 has a cap 20 to cover the balm compound 16.<br>
The apparatus and methods to deliver a topical preparation to the 25      tissue such as hpS or clitoris may also ..be comprised of a solid or semi-solid<br>
compound thai may be directly applied to the lips of the mouth or the undercarriage of the clitoris regardless of the use of a single-or multiple-use delivery system.   The clitoral contact area of the solid or semi-solid compound in one preferred embodiment win have a notch "V" to increase the surface area and clitoral contact 30      of the compound 16, as shown in Figures I and 3.  The notch "V" is arranged with a height of 0.5 to 2 centimeters, and a maximum width of 2 centimeters at the rim of the notch "V".   A properly designed concave notch "V" will topically apply the<br><br>
compound 16 to the 180 degree undercarriage of the clitoris.  With proper directions for use, the application surface will initially contact the vestibular tissue al the base of the clitoris, to spread the. compound on the entire clitoris.  A.gel/cream or liquid compomid~30 of the present_invention" would be-applied to the clitoris with the same 5      motions, but would require a different type of application device.  The gciycream or liquid compound 30 maybe applied by "roller balls" 32 like those used to apply viscous deodorants, as shown in Figures 9 and 10, supported within a foraminous top 34, covered when not needed, by a cap 46.  The gel/cream or liquid compound 30 may also be applied by a sponge or brush 40 secured to a top 42 in a reservoir 10 . 44, as shown in Figures 6 and 7.  A cap 48, shown also in Figure 8 may include a removable seal 50, both of which are arranged to be removable to expose the sponge or brush 40 and openings 46 in the reservoir 44 to supply the fluid compound thereto.   Any of the delivery devices for gel/cream or liquids could be designed to increase the surface area of the applicator tip and generally use the 15     concave notch described for the solid compounds.  The gel/cream and liquid<br>
applicators would have either a single-use reservoir or a multi-use reservoir.  All of the delivery devices would have a cap "C" that would seal the device before the initial use, and protect the applicator tip from contamination before use.  Multi-use devices, such as shown in Figures 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 would have the resealing cap 48 20      for their protection.<br>
The present invention also utilizes the unique properties of a combination menthoI/L-arginine topical clitoral sensitizing preparation.   In one embodiment, a sequential application first by menthol applied topically to the mucous membrane of the clitoris has an almost immediate response by affecting 25      vasodilation and blood engorgement warmth (via the thermoreceptors).  The<br>
duration of menthol's action on mucous membranes may be for fifteen-to-twenty minutes.   Subsequent topical application of L-arginine utilizes its topical or systemic effect, via the NOS synthase/NO system, to create corpus cavernosa engorgement, which has a delayed onset of action from between fifteen to twenty minutes.  Such 30      a sequential delivery of multiple preparations may be accomplished by an applicator 110, as shown in Figure 10.  The applicator 110 may have a plurality of reservoirs 112 and 114,- each with their own conduits 116 and 118 between the reservoirs 112<br><br>
and 114 and a clitoral engaging surface 120.  Each preparation of menthol and L-arginine may have their own rate of distribution, to provide the sequential application to the treatment situs.<br>
                              Jn_a furtherembodiment,acornrnonjeservoir 122 may be arranged<br>
within the applicator 110.  By combining the two compounds within that common reservoir 122 as a simultaneous topical application of menthol and L-arginine together, their effect would be immediate and prolonged because of their two different, but related, methods of action.   Such a range of L-arginine of less than 4% concentration and a range of menthol of less than 5% concentration is preferred in an application, either with the distribution via an applicator 110, or by other<br>
 topical application.<br><br><br>
