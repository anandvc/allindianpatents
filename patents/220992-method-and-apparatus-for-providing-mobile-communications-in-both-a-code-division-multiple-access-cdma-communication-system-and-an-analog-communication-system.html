The present invention relates to communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for providing mobile communications in both a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system and an analog communication system.<br>
In the growing stages of the digital cellular market, a need for telephones that are capable for operation in both digital and analog environments is strongly felt. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems have demonstrated clear advantages over time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and other digital multiple access cellular communication systems. A detailed description of a preferred embodiment of a CDMA cellular communication system is present in U.S. Patent No. 5,103,459 entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM" and U.S. Patent No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS", the disclosures of both are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In addition, there is an anticipated period of time in which certain areas will continue to be served only by analog systems. For this reason, there is a need for cellular telephones that accommodate usage on both traditional analog and CDMA environments.<br><br>
The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for a custom system selection process, in other words system determination, in a multi-mode mobile handset. Though the present invention is described in an exemplary implementation of a dual mode CDMA / analog mobile<br><br>
5<br>
Station,, the disclosure teaches of a methpd that is easily extendiljle to<br>
accommodate a multi-mode mobile station environment such as<br>
CDMA/analog/TDWA.	|    "<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the priient invention, the subscriber<br>
station transitions to analog mode or CDMA mo4t based on the results of<br>
system determination processing. This system determination processing is<br>
performed by a microprocessor or micro-controller programmed jto petform<br>
the operations as described below. The microprocessor or micro-controller<br>
operates in conjunction with a memory element which store the user system<br>
preferences and system parameters based on previqus calls or call attempts.<br>
The memory element may be a part of the microprocessor or micro-conttoUer<br>
or it may be a separate memory element.	;<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for providing system selection criteria for a multi-mode mobile station. The present invention determines the next operating mode of the subscriber station in accordance with (1) a set of system determination rules, (2) a set of user preferences and (3) an exit reason from the system from ^yhich acquisition was last attempted. The present invention discloses a method and apparatus that conforms with Telecommxmications Industry Association (TLA) Interim Standard entitled "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard For Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular system<br>
TIA/EIA/IS95".	I<br>
j<br>
It is an object of the present invetitioh to provide a methodj and apparatus for selecting a system for acquisitioh in accordance with a ^et of user-defined preferences. By providmg systfem lelection m accordance With a predefined ordered set of user preferences, the operation of the subscjriber station is optimized for the user's personal needs. For example, costs to the user may be minimized (e.g. reduced roaming charges). In the present mvention, the user preferences are stored in a nonvolatile memory. The possible user preferences are flexible so that the uystems the subscriber stition attempts to acquire may be diverse or restricted.<br>
It is further an object of the present invention to provide fast acquisition for the user. The method of the pfisent mvention selects a system other than the user's preferred systHlli, if th0 preferred system cannot be acquired. If the system acquired is not thll pr^fiUTid system, then appa-atus of the present mvention will mtermittently enter Jihe system determmation mode to determme whether the preferred system can be acquired at that iime. The system mtermittently checks if the pi'fffei'r^jl tfystem is available based<br><br>
upon a.timer which is set if the subscriber station is not operating usirg the preferred system.<br>
In the preseQirtnvention, a CDMA chanitÂ«l table is maintainec that provides the CDMA charmel which is most likely to be able to pDvide service (i.e. primary or secondary CDMA channel). By maintaining a C DMA channel table, the present invention minimizes acquisition time in COMA acquisition attempts. The CDMA charmel table is reordered each time a CDMA channel different from the top entry in the table is acquired.<br>
The present invention maintains a system preferences table, v,rhic^<br>
specifies an ordered list of systems upon which acquisition will be attempted.<br>
The present invention generates an exit reason each time the subscriber<br>
station enters system determination. This exit reason is used to position a<br>
pointer in the system preferences table directing the subscribe];' station t3 the<br>
next system upon which to attempt acquisition. In addition, the systei|i<br>
determination processor uses information from the system preferences table<br>
to generate entry parameters in the acquisition of a system.	i<br>
It is yet another advantage to the present invention to reduce thejtime for re-acquisition. The system determination processor provides a setvice resimie function wherein the subscriber station attempts to acquire service in a form identical to the service provided prior to the termination of the previous call or service. A service resume function prevents the alctive hardware in the subscriber station from powerihg down, which results in net power and time savings from not having to JJOWfir up the hardware^ In addition, time savings is attained while in CDMA mode because a full re-acquisition is not required by taking advantage of existing timing information.<br>
It is also an advantage of the present system to provide a fast response to a user's request for service. The system determination processor maintains a pointer indicating the system where the service was last available. If an acquisition attempt is aborted, then acquisition is attempted on thei last system known to have service. This results in M lubstantial time savinj;s in acquisition.<br>
It is further an object of the present (|||'en|((:i|i| fio provide a method and apparatus for performing a CDMA to analog ||i|if*'^*Df^- The system ol the present invention is easily extendible to providing ah analog to CDMA hmd-off simply by addition of additional exit rfeaStHW. Moreover, the present invention is of a modular format that is eaBi|;|!' extlWtdiiile to me^t the growing service needs of users.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an apparatus for providing mobile communications in both a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system and an analog communication system, comprising: a system preferences memory area for storing system preferences: a CMDA channel memory area for storing a list of CDMA channels: a user preferences memory area for storing a list of user preferences: analog modulation and demodulation and processing means for transmitting and receiving information signals in accordance with an analog format wherein said analog format is determined in accordance with entry mode parameters; CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing means for transmitting and receiving said information signals in accordance with a CDMA format wherein said CDMA format is determined in accordance with said entry mode parameters; and system determination means for selecting said entry mode parameters and for selectively providing said transmission format to said analog modulation and demodulation and processing means and said CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing means in response to said system preferences,        said        user   preferences,    and    said    CDMA    channels.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for providing mobile communications in both a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system and an analog communication system, said method comprising the steps of: storing system preferences; storing a list of CDMA channels; storing a list of user preferences; communicating information signals in accordance with an analog format wherein said analog format is determined in accordance with entry mode parameters; communicating said information signals in accordance  with a CDMA format wherein  said CDMA format is<br><br>
determined in accordance with said entry mode parameters; and determining said entry mode parameters in accordance with a set of system determination rules, user preferences and an exit reason from a system in which acquisition was last attempted.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION C|t' T| || J^|iEFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to'FIG. 1, when multi-mode subscriber station MMSS 1 is in a system determination substate then the operatlohi ore conducted by system determination processor 8. In the system deferiTtlrifltion substate, system determination processor 8 selects the communk:ntion system for MMSS 1 to use. The exemplary embodiment of MMSS 1 is a dual mode mobile station capable of both analog transmission and reception and code division multiple access (CDMA) transmission and reception. System is defined here as the combination of the serving-system and operating mode. In the exemplary embodiment, possible operating modes include CDMA and analog, o<br>
System determination processor 8 provides acquisition parameters to analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 and CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 6. Which they use in preparing to acquire a communication system.<br>
System determination processor 8 also provides system information tO|<br>
transceiver 3. The system information specifies the frequency of the system<br>
selected to acquire. Transceiver 3 upconverts the modulated data from<br>
analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 and CDMA<br>
modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 6 in accordance ^ith<br>
this frequency information.	\     i<br>
Transceiver 3 also down converts signal received through antenna! 5 in accordance with the frequency information provided by system determination processor 8. The downconverted received signal irom trarisceiver 3 is selectively provided to analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 and CDMA modulation and demodulation!and processing circuitry 6 depending upon which is operational.<br><br><br><br>
I<br>
embodiment, within the online state, MMSS 1 can be in one of two r^odes: analog or digital. In the exemplary embodiment the digital mode is CD^IA.'<br>
In analog mflde, MMSS 1 is performing analog call processinjg. In analog mode operation user information is provided to analog modi^lation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 which modulates th^ user information in accordance with an analog format and provides the modulated data to transceiver 3. Transctiver 3 upconverts and amplifies the signal and broadcasts the signal through Af^tenna B,<br>
Data is received in analog operation by MMSS 1 by antenna 5 and provided to transceiver 3 where it is downdpnVtrted and amplified and provided to analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 where the signal is demodulated in accordance with an analog format and provided to the user of MMSS 1. The design and implementation of analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4 is well known in the art and described in detail in Mohili-XfilluUr Telecommunications Systems/ WilUam C.Y. Lee, McGraw Hill 1989.<br>
In digital mode, MMSS 1 is performing digital call processing using a CDMA modulation format. In digital pr CDMA mode operation user information is provided to CDMA m04t|il^(li(;JO l^nd demodulation and processing circuitry 4 which modulates t|lf) uiWf Information in accordance with an analog format and provides thÂ« ||io4ulÂ«ltÂ«d data to transceiver 3. Transceiver 3 upconverts and amplifies the sigflftl and broadcasts the signal through antenna 5.<br>
Data is received in CDMA mode oJJ^raflcJjri by MMSS 1 by antehna 5 and provided to transceiver 3 where it is tlttvyjncanVirted and amplified and provided to CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing circui^try 6, where the signal is demodulated in accordance with an analog format and provided to the user of MMSS 1. The design and implementation of CpMA modulation and demodulation and processing cil'cuitry 6 is describjed in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent Nps. 4,901,007 and 5,103,459.<br>
Note that when MMSS 1 is in the system determination |substiate it may be temporarily in neither analog mode nor CDMA mode. This ijS not considered a separate mode, but rather is considered a tremsition state.    |<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the first thing that syjstem determination processor 8 does after cofttpletidn of power-up is to retrieve the system preference parameters from nonvolatile (NV) memory eleanent 14. System determination processor 8 selects the preferred system for acquisition in accordance with the retrieved system preference parameters. Another circumstance under which system determination processor 8 will<br><br>
i<br>
retrieve the system preference parameters from nonvolatile mimor]<br>
element 14 is when the exit reason from analog mode or CDMA | mod*<br>
indicates that system^reference parameter! have changed.	|<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, system determination processor i retrieves one of the following preferred operational mode parameter^ fron nonvolatile memory element 14:<br>
a.	CDMA preferred;<br>
b.	CDMA only;<br>
c   analog preferred; or d. analog only.<br>
If MMSS 1 is to operate in a CDMA pfUfetted modej, then system determination processor 8 retrieves one of the following user preferences from system preferences table 12:<br>
a.	A system only<br>
b.	A system preferred<br>
c.	B system only<br>
d.	B system preferred<br>
e.	Home system identification (SID) only<br>
f.	Specific SID(s) to acquire only	!|<br>
I. I In   the   exemplary   embodiment,  nonvolatile   memory   element |14 is<br>
implemented using a programmable read only memory.   Typically, the A<br>
system uses a different carrier frequency than the B system.   When s|^stem<br>
determination processor 8 selects a system Wpon which to attempt acquisition<br>
it provides the carrier frequency informatioh to transceiver 3, which attempt<br>
acquisition in accordance with the carrier frequency information.	I.<br>
The system identification (SID) parameters, specify a group of cells for a<br>
selected serving system. The cell-sites of one serving system in a specified<br>
geographic area will have a different SID number than the cell-sitef of a<br>
different serving system in the same geographic area. The cell-sites ojf one<br>
serving system in a specified geographic area Will also have a differenf SID<br>
number than the cell-sites of the same serving system in a different<br>
geographic area.	f<br>
If the user of MMSS 1 wishes to reatfict the cell-sites that MMSS 1 is able to access, in order to reduce the incurred rOiNug charges, the Hom| SID option is used, which restricts service to a particular area.   If, on the bther<br><br><br><br>
inaication that service is currently aVailatilion an analog systeir|. An<br>
origination command is a command inljicatiltg that the user of MMsS 1 is<br>
initiating a call or service.	<br><br>
System determination processor 8 provides analog entry mode paramefers to analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4, Which includes an entry reason. Entry reasons include!<br>

2.	Resume analog operation in which H iflstm' acquisition attempt is conducted based upon a previous acqulajtioft iÂ»f the same system;<br>
3.	CDMA to analog hand-oi?f;<br>
4.	Origination entry in MMSS 1 attempts acqMitlon on a non preferred system in order to reduce the acquisition iltnÂ» (fOr example, MMSS 1 is attempting to acquire a CDMA system When U\ Originatijsn command is received, MMSS 1 will abort the attemjit to acquire the preferred CDMA system and perform acquisition upon the system upon which it has previously had service; and<br>
5.	Analog voice chaimel assignment from CDMA in which the CDMA base station directs MMSS 1 to an analog channel for continuing service. -<br>

The exemplary embodiment complies fully with the rules of the| industry standards ai\d provides optimized performance in a multi-n^ode environment.<br>
The discussion which follows is based on the existence in MMSS liof a preferred mode (analog preferred or CDMA preferred/ as opposed to analog only or CDMA only) and a preferred serving*lystem (A then B or B then A, as opposed to A only or B only). In the exemplary implementation, there exist two CDMA frequencies (primary and secondary) RS o|)posed to just one. jThe implementation operates with options for all conditions to illustrate the selection method performed by the apparatus of the present invention.<br>
The use of two options is designed to provide clear and simple illustration. It should be noted that the techniques employed for dual-mode are easily expanded to multi-mode operation. If MMSS 1 is configured to have only one mode, or one serving-system, or one CDMA frequency, then the appropriate system determination step is skipped. Similarly, if theire is more than two serving systems, then the decision criteria need only reflect the additional consideration of one more possible serving system. Listed below is a superset of all possibilities in a BysteOt of two possible modes, two possible serving systems and two possible C|tlM-('| ftilJUendes.<br>
System determination processor 8 dftferit^iijinei the mode and serving-system according to the following priorities, ltOJt\ Highest to lowest:<br>
1.	Preferred mode using the preferred serving System;<br>
2.	Non-preferred mode using the preferred |e^i(ig iygtem;     ,<br>
3.	Preferred mode usmg the non-preferred SlrVifis lyitem; anc<br>
4.	Non-preferred mode using the non-prefilted jiell*Vllig system-<br>
So, for example, if the preferred mode is CDMA and the preferred servmg<br>
system is B, then the priority is CDMA-p, an<llog cdma-a analog-a.></llog>
Every time control returns to system determination processor 8 for a reason<br>
that requires re-acquisition, system determination processor 8 starts with the<br>
system of the highest priority.	|        i<br>
In the case of CDMA acquisition, system determmation processor 8 directs initial acquisition on the primary channel first, followed by the secondary channel if acquisition on tlte primary channel fails. CDMA acquisition is performed by MMSS 1 aequirmg a pilot channel which is a signal broadcast by a base station which provides coarse timing synchronization mformation to MMSS 1. After aequirmg the pilot channel, MMSS   1   acquires   the   synchronization   channel   for   fine   timing<br><br>
synchronization and at this point MMSS 1 iai ready to conduct service on allocated voice data channels. Once acquisition succeed^, then the first channel acquired .jUprimary or secondary) iS thÂ« one maintained for all subsequent CDMA acquisitions until:<br>
1.	CDMA pilot acquisition fails;<br>
2.	MMSS 1 is reset (either via regular powetdown/powerup cycle or via soft<br>
reset after exit from offline state); or<br>
3.	The preferred system (A/B and/or CDMA/Analog) has changed.<br><br><br>
4.	NEXT.STATE- Current state (online or offline) and operating jcnc^de<br>
(CDMA or analog);	|     5.	LAST_SYSTEM:^ITH_SERVICE- Indicates lyutem (mode and serving<br>
system), if any, where service is currently available;	|<br>
6.	CDMAâACQ_CHANNEL- Current CDMA acquisition channil (primary<br>
or secondary) at the current table index location in the CDMA charmel<br>
table 10;<br>
7.	LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED- The system (i^ode and serving system)<br>
where the last acquisition attempt wai made; and<br>
8.	NEW_MODE_OR_SYS- Indicator for CDMA mode whether the mobile<br>
station was previously operating in a different mode or serving system<br>
(utilized for CDMA registration processihg)-<br>
In block 30, MMSS 1 is powered up thereby initializing the operation of system determiriation processor 8. Proceeding to block 32, system determination processor 8 gets the user system preferences from memory 14.1 In block 34, system determination 8 builds system preferences and CDMA channel tables and stores them into system preferertces table 12 and CDMA; channel table 10, respectively.<br><br><br>
The flow proceeds to block 46 in Which the variable LASTLSYSTEM.ENTERED is set to CURRBHt.SYSTEM.<br>
The flow procss to control block 48 whÂ«re NEXT.STA^E is test^ to determine if it is online CDMA. If NEXT3TATE is not online CDMAJ the flow proceeds to block 52. Control block SS test! if NEXT_STATE is orlline analog. If NEXT.STATE is not online analog, thth in block 58 system determination processor 8 tells the MMSS 1 to enter offline mode, thejn in block 60 MMSS 1 powers down.<br>
If in block 52, the NEXT_STATE vatiable is online analogy then the flow proceeds to block 54, which sets a flag to indicating to system determination processor 8 that the CDMA Capability Global Action Message (GAM) should be ignored, because acquisition is being attempted using the| preferred system. Proceeding to block 56, system determination processor 8 sets the analog entry reason to acquisition. The flow then proceeds to bloqk 70 and control is passed to analog modulation &amp;t\d demodulation and procesising circuitry 4. Upon exit from analog mode, Control is returned to system determination processor 8, accompanied by the analog exit parameters provided by analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4.<br>
Blocks 74-96 are control blocks which examine the exit reason provided by analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4. Block 74 tests if the analog exit reason is a normal exit. If it is determined that the control has returned to system determination processor 8, because of a normal exit, then the flow proceeds to block 130. In bloqk 130, system determination processor 8 checks if thÂ» reanon that analog mode was previously entered was due to a CDMA-to-anlog| hand-off.<br>
If the reason for operation in analog mode was not a hand-off from CDMA mode, then the flow proceeds to block 132. In block 132, the variable LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE is set to LAST^SYSTEM_ENTERED. Because this was a "Normal Exit" from analog mode system determination processor knows that MMSS 1 was able to sucessfully acquire service on the analog system specified by LAST.SYSTEM^RNTBKED. The flow then proceeds to control block 134 which tests if the variable CURRENT_SYSTEM is set to the preferred system. If the varlftblf CURRENT_SYSTEM is the preferred system, then system determination pfdi|890r 8 sets the analog entry reason to resume, meaiung the analog sy|||||n j||litl|lli Ihould be re-acqiiired, and control is again passed to the analog ii|0dulM|l0n and demodulation ^d processing circuitry 4 in block 70.<br>
If the variable CURRENT.SYSTEM ll not the preferred system or if analog mode was previously entered due tO a CPMAto-analog hand-off the<br><br>
flow proceeds to block 136 which sets the variable CURRENT_SYSTEM to the oitfy at the top of the system preferences tttblf 12/ SO that the next acquisition attempt will be made on the preferred sySt^ttt. The flow then proceeds to block 140, where the idle timer is disabled, since acquisition will be atteijnpted on the preferred system. Then in block 141, the Variable NEXT_STATE is set a value based on the value of the variable CUWIINT.STATE {i.e., online CDMA or online Armlog) and flow proceeÂ«lÂ« to Mmk |44.<br>
In block 144, system determination brof!|iaiOf 8 checks if the variable<br>
NEXT.STATE is online CDMA. If NEXT^STATE IS online CDMA, tHen in<br>
block 146 the CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL W set to the top entry in CDMA<br>
channel table 10, and in block 148 a flag \ii set llTicllcllting that operation was<br>
previously conducted on a different systehl (i.e. ar^ttlog). If in block 144, the<br>
variable NEXT_STATE is not online CDMA or following tl^e execution of<br>
block 148, flow returns to block 46 where the operation proceeds as previously<br>
described.	'	,<br>
Back in control block 74, if the analog exit reason is not normal exit,<br>
then the flow moves to block 76 which tests J| the analog exit reason is a<br>
failed acquisition. If the analog exit reason is failed acquisition, then the flow<br>
proceeds    to    block    180.     Block  180    tests    if   the!   vaijiable<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED   equals   LAST_SVSTEM_WITH_SEfiVICte.   If<br>
LAST.SYSTEM.ENTERED equals LAST,SYSTEM^WITH_SERVICE, then<br>
the flow moves to block 182. In block 18^^ LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE<br>
is set to indicate that no service is currently avaikble, because the variably<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE is equal to the analog system that was just<br>
exited and the exit reason indicated that the acquisition attempt failed. Jf the<br>
variable LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED does not equal the value of the variable<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE or after execution of block 182, thej flow<br>
proceeds to block 184, which tests if the reason analog mode was entered was<br>
due to a CDMA-to-analog hand-off.	|<br>
If analog mode was not entered as a result of a CDMA hand-off,| then<br>
I the   flow   proceeds   to   block   186.    In block 18 6,   the   variable<br>
CURRENT^SYSTEM is set to the next enfary In system preferences table 12. If<br>
the last entry in the system preferences table has been reached, then the<br>
variable CURRENT_SYSTEM is set to the first entry in system preferi'nces<br>
table 12.    The flow proceeds to contlfiJl bllftck 190 which tests i: the<br>
::URRENT_SYSTEM is the preferred system,   tl thÂ» CURRENT^SYSTI M is<br>
lot flie preferred system, then the flow proceeds to block 550.<br>
In block 550, the variable NEXT_STATE is set based upon the system<br>
:urrently selected for acquisition.     Then in block  552.  the variable<br><br>
LAST_^SYSTEM_ENTERED is set ft) the Value of the vajriable CUjyRENT.SYSTEM. The idle timer is enablf4 ih block 554, since thb neict acquisition attempliWvill be n\ade for a fton-preferred system. In control block 556, system determination processor 8 tests if the value of the variable NEXT.STATE is online CDMA. If the Variable NEXT.STATE is pnline CDMA, then system determination processor 8 sets the CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL to the top entry in the CDMA channel table 10. Then, in block 560, a flag is set indicating that operation was previously conducted on a different system. In block 562, the CDMA entry reason! is se| to acquisition and the flow proceeds to block 370, where CDMA mode i^ entered and control is passed to CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 6.<br>
Back in block 556 if NEXT_STATB il not Ohlihe CDMA, then the flow proceeds to block 564. In block 564, system delnrmihation processor 8 tests if there is a CDMA system in system prefere|tces tiblt 12 at a higher preference level than the CURRENT.SYSTEM. If there is Â« higher preference level than CURRENT_SYSTEM, then the flow proceeds to block 566 where a flag is set to indicate that the CDMA Capability GAM should be monitored. If in block 564 it is determined that there is not a CDMA system at a higher preference level than the analog system currently selectod for acquisition, then the flag is set to ignore the CDMA Capability GAM, Following the execution of both blocks 566 and 568, the flow proceeds to block $70 which sets the analog entry reason to acquisition. From block 570, thÂ« flow proceeds to block 70 where analog mode is entered and control is pAss^jil tO analog modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 4.<br>
Back in block 76, if the analog exit tfm\i\ WHs not acquisition failed,<br>
then the flow proceeds to control block 78 whicj^t teits if the analog exit reason<br>
is acquisition terminated. If the analog exit reHion if acquisition terminated,<br>
then the flow proceeds to control blppk flO. tn block 230, system<br>
determination processor 8 tests if the Vilj-taWi t.AlT_SYSTEM_ENTiRED<br>
equals the variable LAST^SYSTEM_WIT^,BBRVICE. I^ the variable<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED	equals	the   |     vari^le<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE, then the floW proceeds to block 232.| The<br>
variable LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICB ts Sit tO indicate] no service is<br>
available, because LAST^SYSTEM_WITH3EltVlCI is the analog s&gt;jstem<br>
that was just exited and the exit reason indicated that the analog system is not<br>
acceptable for acquisition so service is no longer available.	j<br>
If in block 230 LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED does not ^qual LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE or following the execution of block'232,<br><br>
the flow proceeds to block 234 where the variable CURRENT_SYSTEM is set<br>
to the next entry in system preferences tJibje lit II the last entry in system<br>
preferences table larflas been reached, thUH Cll|RlNT_SYSTEM is set to the<br>
top entry in system preferences table 12. Till* fltlW plOCeeds to block 236 which<br>
tests if the CURRENT.SYSTEM in thÂ» preferred system.^ If<br>
CURRENT_SYSTEM is not the preferred lystim^ then the flow proceeds to<br>
block 550 and the operation proceeds as delM3^bÂ«(l previously.	',<br>
If in block 236 the variable CUJliifeHT..,SyitEM is] the preferred system, then the flow proceeds to block I3l|| wll0t'Â» the idle timer is disabled, because the next acquisition attempt wiU attempt to acquir^ the preferred system. The flow proceeds to block 240, where the variable NEXT_STATE is set based on the value of the variable CURRENT3YSTEM.: Then in block 242, system determination processor 8 tests if HEXT.STATE is online CDMA. If NEXT_STATE is online CDMA, then the flow proceeds to block 244 which sets CDMA_ACQlCHANNEL to flie top entry in the CDMA channel table 10. Then in block 246, a flag is set to indicate that the system in whicn operation was being conducted has changed, since operation was previously being conducted in analog mode. If in block 242 NEXT.STATE is not online CDMA or following the execution of block 246, the flow proceeds to blOck 46 and the operation proceeds as described eatlier.<br>
Back in block 78 if the analog exit reason is not acquisition terminated, then the flow proceeds to block 80 which teste if the analog exit reason is CDMA Available. If the exit reason is CDMA available, then the | flow proceeds to block 280. In block 280, systÂ«rt\ determination processor ^ sets LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE equal to LAST_SYSTEM_ENTEREd It should be noted that the CDMA available exit reason indicates that service was successfully obtained on the analog system that was just exited.<br>
Proceeding to block 282, the variable CURRENT.SYSTEM is set to the<br>
top entry in system preferences table 12. In block 284, the idle tinier is<br>
disabled, and then in block 286 the variable NBXT_STATE is set based on<br>
CURRENT.SYSTEM. Proceeding to control block 288, system determination<br>
8 tests if NEXT.STATE is online CDMA. If NiXt JTATE is online CDMA,<br>
then the flow goes to block 290 which $m the CDMA_ACQ_CHA&gt;iNEL<br>
equal to the chaimel specified in the CDMA Capability GAM. Then in jjlock<br>
292, a flag is set to indicate that we were pti^viotlsly operating on a different<br>
system (i.e. analog).	s<br>
Back in block 80 if the analog exit reason is not CDMA availablfe the flow proceeds to block 82. In block 82, if the Inalog exit reason is idle tinwout, then  the  flow  proceeds  to  block  330,     Ih block 330, the variable<br><br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE is set t0 LASTJYSTEM.ENTERED. It should be noted that the idle timeout exit reason indicates service was successfully acquimid on the analog system just exited. In block 332 CURRENT_SYSTEM is set to the top entry in system preferences table 12. Then in block 334 the idle timer is disabled, since the next acquisition attempt will be on the preferred system. In block 336^ the variable NEXT_ST-^TE is set based upon CURRENT_SYSTEM (i.e. online CDMA or online Analcjg).<br>
In block 338, if NEXT.STATE is online CDMA, then the flow prcjceeds<br>
to block 340 where the CDMA_AC(X.CHANlsfBL is set to ^e top en^ in<br>
CDMA Charmel Table 10, and then in blocji 34^ a flag is set to indicate that the<br>
system in which operation was being cpn4t4cted has changed, because<br>
operation was previously being conducted it\ analog mode. If bdck in<br>
block 338 NEXT_STATE is not online CDMA or following the execution of<br>
block 342, the flow proceeds to block 46 and the operation proceeds as<br>
described earlier.	|<br>
If, back in block 82, the analog exit rfeason was not idle timeout] then<br>
the flow proceeds to control block 90. In block 90, system determination<br>
processor 8 tests if the analog exit reason i^ an origination command received.<br>
If the analog exit reason is an origination comtTtand received, then the flow<br>
proceeds to block 750. In block 7S0, CURRENT.SYSTEM and<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED	$t^	Nt	equal	to<br>
LAST^SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE.	U    ihatÂ»id    be    noted    that<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE indicatftÂ» thÂ« system where service is believed to be currently available. Then i^ b|ock 702, NEXT_STATE is set based on the value of CURRENT.SYSTEM.<br>
then the<br>
flow<br>
Then in block 754, if NEXT.STATK is |lÂ«litt# CDMA, proceeds to block 756. In block 756, th0 Ct3MA^ACQ_CHANNEL is set LAST^CHANNEL_WITH_SERVICE, the CdMA acquisition ihannel where service is available. It is possible this may not be equal to the prima: y or secondary CDMA acquisition channel for the designated CDMA syiterri. Then in block 758, a flag is set to indicate that the CDMA system to be acquired is different from the system whtfe the previous acquisition attempt was made. Next in block 760, the CDMA entry reason is set to prigihatioii and the flow proceeds to block 370, where CDMA mode is entered and conti ol is passed to CDMA modulation and demodulation and processing cir
 <br>
I| back in blcx:k 90, the analog exit reason is ftot origination command received, then the flow proceeds to control tJlock 92. If in control block $2 the analog exit reason iÂ§j,|Â»aging channel lost, th^n the flow proceeds to block 130 and the operation proceeds as described eafUer. If, in block 92, the analog exit reason is not paging channel lost, then the flow proceeds to block 94J If in block 94, the analog exit reason is preferred system changed, then thej floW proceeds to block 800. The preferred system exit reason indicates that th^ usei| has changed the system preferences and it is necessary to rebuild systeni preferences table 12 and reset the system determination parameters.       '<br>
In block 800, the variable LAST.SYSTBM^WITH.SERVICE is iet to indicate that no service is available. Proceeding to block 802, system determination processor 8 retrieves lyitem preferences from memory element 14. Proceeding to block 804, the CPMA^LOCK_STATUS is checked to determine if CDMA is locked. A CDMA lâ¬J*!|ced (Status indicates th^t the CDMA system is prohibiting MMSS 1 from accessing the CDMA system. If the CDMA status is locked, then the flow proceeds to block 806, which checks if the user preferences include an analog preference. If in block 806 the user preferences do not include analog then the flow proceeds to block 808 and MMSS 1 enters the offline state. If m block 906, the user preferences do mclude analog, then the mode preference in set to Analog Only. This allows the MMSS 1 to access the analog systems even though prohibited ifrom accessing the CDMA systems.<br>
In block 804, if the CDMA_.LCX:K_STATt lÂ» Indicates the system ^*s not<br>
locked or following the execution of block |i(p, ||tlll fltlW proceeds to bloclj: 812.<br>
In block 812, both the system preferences tf ble ii $t\d CDMA channel table 10<br>
are rebuilt. Proceeding to block 814, the Variable CURRENT.SYSTEM is set<br>
to the top entry in the system preferences table 12 so that the initial<br>
acquisition attempt will be on the preferrttlf syifetllli Pf the rebuilt table^. In<br>
block 816, the idle timer is disabled, since H0(|iiiKltlCHl WUI be at empted c^ the<br>
preferred system. In block 818, the variable NBXT^STATE is set based upon<br>
the value of CURRENT.SYSTEM. The flow proceeds to coijtrol block 820<br>
where if the NEXT.STATE is onlme CDMA, the flow proceeds to colntfol<br>
block822.	I<br>
In block 822 if LAST_SYSTEM_ENTiRED iÂ« hot CURRENT.SYSTEM, then the flow proceeds to block 824 where a flag is set to mdicate that the CDMA system to be acquired is different from the system where tne previous acquisition attempt was made. After the execution of block 8^4, orj if in block 822  LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED  is  ClIRRENT.SYSTEM^ or jf in<br><br>
block 820 if NEXT_STATE is not online CDMA&gt; then the flow proceejis to<br>
block 46 and the operation proceeds as previously described.	|        j<br>
Back in bl9cl^4 if the analog exit reason was not preferred syjstem changed, then the flow proceeds to block 96. If in block 96, the inalog exit reason is offline command received, then the floW proceeds to block 98 \yhere MMSS 1 enters the offline state. After thÂ© execution Of block 98 or if in block 96 the analog exit reason is not offline conin&gt;4nd received, then the flo\y proceeds to block 100 and MMSS 1 is powered down.<br>
If back in block 48 CURRENT_SYSTEM iÂ» onlihe CDMA, then thel flow proceeds to block 370 and control is pÂ«Â»se4 to CpMA modulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 6. When CDMA mbdulation and demodulation and processing circuitry 6 passes control back to systeEJi determination processor 8 in block 372, it provides exit parameters. In blocks I 374 through 420, svstem determination processor 8 examines the exit reason i and operates accordingly.<br>
Proceeding to block 374, if the CDMA exit reason is normal exit^i then<br>
the flow proceeds to block 450. In block 400, the CDMA channel table efttries<br>
are reordered so that CDMA_ACQ_CHl^NN|L i$ at the top of CDMA<br>
channel table 10. Then in block 452, systilh dlttrtftination processor 8 sets<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE to LAST_StBTKM_ENTERED, bec;ause<br>
the normal exit reason indicates that service we^jl successfully acquired on the<br>
CDMA    system    just    exited.	Proceeding    to    block    4 54,<br>
LAST_CHANNEL_WITH_SERVICE is set to CDMA.ACQ_CHANNELi<br>
Next, if in block 456 CURRENT_SYSTIM is the preferred system,! then the flow proceeds to block 464. In block 464, CDMA^ACQ-CHANNEL islused for re-acquisition of the current CDMA systtm. After execution of blocK 464 the flow proceeds to block 462, which sets tJie CDMA entry reason to resume and the flow proceeds to block 370 where opÂ«Mtion proceeds as descjribed earlier.<br>
If, in block 456, CURRENT.SYSTEM |S t0 ihÂ« preferred system,! then the flow proceeds to block 466 where ClJH|^:NtÂ«.iYSTEM is set to the top entry in system preferences table 12, whif!|t ia thÂ« system comprised c)f the preferred mode and the preferred serving iy^teltt. ThRn in block 468, th^ idle timer is disabled since the acquisition atttllibt i|| ^Jfllrtg tnade on the pref srred system. In block 470, the variable NptJtATB is se: based upon CURRENT_SYSTEM.<br>
The flow proceeds to control block 472/ where if NEXT_STATE is online CDMA, the flow proceeds to block 474. In bloclc 474, system determination processor 8 sets the CDMA^ACQ,CHANNEL to the top tentry<br><br>
of CDMA channel table 10 , which provides either the primary or secondary CDMA acquisition channel in the exemf&gt;lary embodiment. In block |476,ja flag is set to indicai#that the system to be used is different from the sjyste]|n used previously, because another CDMA serving system was previously being used. After the execution of block 4f 6 or If ir\ block 472 NEXT.SJTATE is not online CDMA, the flow proceeds to block 46 where the opejration proceeds as described earlier.<br>
If in block 374 the exit reason is not normal exit, then the flow pr0cee(|is<br>
to block 376. If in block 376 the CDMA exit reason is acquisition failed^ thed<br>
the flow proceeds to block 500. In control block 500, if the variable<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED equals LAST.^SYSTEM^WITH_SERVIC6 and<br>
CDMA_ACC2_CHAN is LAST_CHANÂ«WlTM.8ERVICE, then the flow<br>
proceeds to block 502. In block 502, LAdT.SYSTEM.WITH_SERVICE is set<br>
to indicate that no service is currently known to be available, bejcause<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE and CDMA^ACQ^CHANNEL correspond<br>
to the CDMA system and CDMA acquliitioH channel where acquisition<br>
failed. Following the execution of block 502 or if in block^ 50 0<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED	does	not	equal<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE or CDMA.ACQ^CHAN is not LAST_CHAN_WITH_SERVICE, then the flow proceeds to block 508.    j<br>
In block 508, system determination processor 8 determines jif an acquisition attempt has been made on both primary and secondary CpMA acquisition channels. If acquisition has hot betn attempted on 'both acquisition channels, then the flow proceeds to block 504 j and CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL is set to the next #cqtjl|itiÂ»i\ channel in the cbMA Channel table. Note that this implemÂ«(tlfttiiM1i nUows easy expansion to CDMA systems of any number of channel*. TJll^ lf|l0W proceeds to bloc^ 506 where the CDMA entry reason is set to icquisltion and then to block 370 where operation proceeds as previously deÂ«Clribei|.<br>
If in block 508, acquisition attempt* H^vi t'tfit made c^ both CDMA<br>

CURRENT.SYSTEM is not the preferred Uysttm^ the flow is directed to<br>
block 550 and operation proceeds as deiCribedl eftflier, otherwise the flow<br>
proceeds to block 514.	?<br>
In block 514, the idle timer is disabled, since the acquisition attompt will be on the preferred system, then in block 516 NEXT.STATE is set based<br><br>
upon CURRENT.SYSTEM (i.e. online CDMA or Online Analog). The flow then proceeds to block 518, where if NEXLSTATB i$ online GDMA the flow is directed to block MO where CDMA_AC(X.CHANNEL is set to tl^e top entry in CDMA channel table 10. Then in block 522 a flag indicating a sj'stem change is set, since previously attempted acquisition of the CDMA system was with another serving system. Following the execution of block 522 or if in block 518 NEXT.STATE is not online and CDMA, then the flow proceeds to block 46 where operation proceeds as previously ^escribed.<br>
If in block 376, the CDMA exit reason is hot acquisition failed, then the<br>
flow proceeds to block 378. If in block 3f |, the CDMA exit reason is idle<br>

table 10 is reordered so that the CDMA_ACQ^CHANNEL is a^ the top 0f the<br>
CDMA chaimel table 10, since the idle timeout exit reason indicates successf^<br>
acquisition using the CDMA system specified by LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED<br>
and     CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL.	Then     in     block     6 02,<br>
LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE is set to LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED.<br>
Then in block 604, LAST_CHANNEL^WITH^SERVICE is set to the<br>

Proceeding to block 608, the idle timer is disabled and in bloclj 610 NEXT.STATE is set based on CURRENT^SYSTEM. Next in control block 612, if the NEXT_STATE is online CDMA, then the flow procee|is to block 614 where the CDMA_ACQ_CHANNBL is set to the top entjy of CDMA chaimel table 10. Then in block 6J|Â», B flag Is set to indicate tjiat a different system was previously being use4 since CDMA modulation, and demodulation and processing circuitry 6 was Using the other serving system.

If the last entry in the system preferences table ha^ been reached, then set CURRENT_SYSTEM to the firit entry in system preferences table 12. Then m control block 658, if CUKRBNT_SYSTEM is ndt the preferred system, then the flow proceeds to Hock 550 and the operation proceeds as previously described.<br>
If CURRENT.SYSTEM is the preferred system, the flow proceeds to block 660 where the idle timer is disabled and then in to block 663 where NEXT_STATE is set in based upon CURRENT_.8YSTEM. Then in block 664, if NEXT_STATE is online CDMA, then tj^e ftoW proceeds to block 666 where the CDMA.ACQJCHANNEL is set to the entry at the top of the CDMA channel table 10. Next in block 668, a flag is set to indicate that the CDMA system to be acquired is different from the system where the previous acquisition attempt was made. Following ihe execution of block 668 or if in block 664 NEXT_STATE is not online CfcJMA* thett the flo^v proceeds to block 46 and the operation proceeds as described previously.<br>
If back in block 380, the CDMA exit reason was not acquisition terminated, then the flow proceeds to block 382. If In block 382 the CDMA exit reason is acquisition lost, then the flow proceeds to block 450 and operation proceeds as described previously, If in block 382 the CDMA exit reason is not acquisition lost, then the flow pifocteds tO block 410. In blocjc 410 if the CDMA exit reason is CDMA hand-ttff, then the flow proceeds to block 700.<br>
In block 700, CDMA channel table 10 is reordered such that the CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL is at the top of ike tnl^Je. Note that the CD^A to analog hand-off exit reason indicates that seryicji was successfully acquired on the CDMA system just exited. Then in block 7|0 2, LAST_SYSTEM_WITH_SERVICE is set to LAST_SYSTEM_ENTERED. Then in block 704, LAST.CHANNEL^WITH.SERVICE is se^ to CDMA_ACQ_CHANNEL. In block 706, system determmation proves! ;or 8 sets up the analog entry parameters with CDMA to analog hani-off parameters.<br>
In control block 708, if the CDMA Himd'0|f

origiiiation or page response hand-off the analog paging channel v^ill first be<br>
acquired and it is niSlf^'desirable to exit analog mode until the pen4ing c^ll is<br>
completed. This is done to prevent exit from analog mode because^ of ax\ idle<br>
timeout or receipt of a CDMA Capability GAM. For the other CDMA to<br>
analog hand-off types the mobile station Will proceed to directly acquire the<br>
analog voice channel where by default the idle timeout and CDMA (|5AM<br>
monitoring are disabled.	|<br>
Following the execution of block 712 oi* if in block 708 the CDMA Ijand-off is not origination or page response, thÂ« flow proceeds to block 714. In block 714 the analog entry reason is set to CDMA to analog han{d-off and then the flow proceeds to block 70 and operation proceeds as described previously.!<br>
If back in block 410 the CDMA exit reason io not CDMA hand-off then the flow proceeds to block 412. If in block 412 the CDMA exit reason is because a lock or unlock order was received, then the flow proceeds to block 720 where the CDMA lock status is updated, The flow then proceeds to|t&gt;lock 800 and the operation proceeds as previously described. If in block 412 the CDMA exit reason is not a lock or tmlock Ordef, the flow proceeds to block 414. In block 414, if the CDMA exit reason is befillUse of incompatible protocol revision then the flow proceeds to block 600 a^\d the operation proceeds as previously described.<br>
If in block 414 the CDMA exit reason is hot incompatible protocol, the flow proceeds to block 416. If in block 416 the CDMA exit reason (s an origination command was received, aborting the CDMA acquisition attempt in progress, then the flow proceeds to block ^lO nftd the operation proceejis as described previously. If in block 416 the CDMA exit reason is not origiiiation command received, the flow proceeds to block 418. W in block 418 the CIpMA exit reason is because the user changed the preferred system, then the jflow proceeds to block 800 and the operation proceeds |i| dieicribed earlier.       i<br>
If in block 418 the CDMA exit reaitm is |Utt preferred system change, then the flow proceeds to block 420. In bloiilk 4|tt I if ihe CDMA exit reasjon is offline command received, then the flow pr()ceeil9 to block 422. In block 422 the offline mode is entered.
