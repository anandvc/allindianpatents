				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to aminoplast-based crosslinking compositions and their<br>
method of preparation. In particular, the invention relates to aminoplast-based<br>
crosslinking compositions, which are prepared by reacting amino compounds with<br>
mono(alkylaldehydes) and/or poly(alkylaldehydes) and alcohol.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditional industrial coatings have for years been based in significant part on<br>
backbone resins having active hydrogen groups crosslinked with various derivatives of<br>
amino-1,3,5-triazines. Most notable armong the amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives are the<br>
aminoplasts such as the alkoxymethyl derivatives of melamine and guanamines which,<br>
while providing excellent results in a number of aspects, have the disadvantage of<br>
releasing formaldehyde as a volatile by-product under curing conditions and requiring<br>
relatively high temperatures to adequately crosslink the film.<br>
Despite the excellent film costing properties, which can be achieved with<br>
aminoplast crosslinked systems, the coatings industry is under great pressure to reduce<br>
the environmentally undesirable emission of formaldehyde. In addition, high temperature<br>
crosslinking systems require more energy to cure and/or crosslink slower resulting in less<br>
throughput. As a result, it has long been a desire of industry to find acceptable alternative<br>
crosslinkers and coatings systems, which emit no formaldehyde, or low amounts of<br>
formaldehyde, and cure at lower temperatures.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3, 806, 503 and 4,180,488 disclose the preparation of resins<br>
prepared by reacting melamine with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and an alcohol. However,<br>
neither patent discloses nor teaches reacting a non-melamine based amino compound<br>
with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and/or poly(alkylaldehyde).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,454,133 discloses the preparation of antimicrobial compounds<br>
prepared by reacting an amide or imide compound with poly(alkylaldehydes), e.g.,<br>
glutaraldehyde. However, the patent neither discloses nor teaches reacting an amino-<br>
based compound with mono(alkylaldehydes) and/or poly(alkylaldehydes) and alcohol to<br>
form a crosslinking composition.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the term "mono(alkylaldehyde)" is an aldehyde having the<br>
general formula: R2-CHO, where R2 is alkyl, halogenated alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, halogenated<br>
aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or an alkaryl, having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms or about 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms or about 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "poly(alkylaldehydel' is an aldehyde having the general formula:<br>
B-[-CHO]n, where B is a organic residue of a poly(alkylaldehyde) with n aldehyde groups<br>
and n is an integer of 2 to about 8. A non-limiting example of a poly(alkylaldehyde) is<br>
glutaraldehyde having the structure OHC-(CH2)3-CHO, where B is -(CH2)3- and n is<br>
equal to 2.<br>
The term "and/or" means either or both. For example, "A and/or B" means A or B,<br>
or both A and B.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl," as used herein, is a monovalent hydrocarbon group in<br>
which the valency is derived by extraction of a hydrogen from a carbon. Hydrocarbyl<br>
includes, for example, atiphatics (straight and branched chain), cycloaliphatics, aromatics<br>
and mixed character groups (e.g., aralkyl and alkaryl). Hydrocarbyl also includes groups<br>
with internal unsaturation and activated unsaturation. More specifically, hydrocarbyl<br>
includes, but is not timited to: alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl,<br>
and alkynyl, typically having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably having from 1 to<br>
about 12 carbon atoms or 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. A hydrocarbyl may contain one or<br>
more carbonyl groups (which is/are included in the carbon count) and/or a heteroatom or<br>
heteroatoms (such as at least one oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or silicon) in the chain or ring.<br>
In addition, a hydrocarbyl may have one or more of the hydrogens of the hydrocarbon<br>
group replaced by a functional group commonly found in organic molecules. The phrase<br><br>
international group commonly found organic molecules" means non-nyarocarbyl groups<br>
that are typically found in organic molecules including, but not limited to, halides, cyano<br>
groups, amino groups, thiol groups, carboxylate groups, hydroxyl groups, sulfonate<br>
groups, nitroso groups, nitro groups, and the like.<br>

and/or a poly(alkylaldehyde); and an alcohol; v/here said amino compound is selected<br>
from the group consisting of: linear or cyclic ureas, cyanuric acid, substituted cyanuric<br>
acids, linear or cyclic amides, glycolurils, hydantoins, linear or cyclic carbamates and<br>

Examples of poly(alkylaldehyde) which made be used in this invention include, but<br>
are not limited to glutaraldehyde; the reaction product of crotonaldehyde and polyhydrihc<br>
alcohols, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, sorbitol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>

aldehydes.<br><br>
Non-limiting examples of alcohols that may be used in this invention are methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the above reaction, the mo ar ratio of amino groups in all amino compounds,<br>
including guanamine and/or melamire, to mono(alkylaldehyde) is about 1.0.1 to about<br>
1:30, or about 1:0.25 to about 1:10 or about 1:0.5 to about 1:5. In this application "amino<br>
groups" include groups with primary and/or secondary amines, i.e., -NH2 and -NHR<br>
groups, respectively.<br>
In addition, the molar ratio of amino groups in the amino compounds to aldehyde<br>
groups in the poly(alkylaldehyde) is about 0.1:1 to about 50:1, or about 0.5:1 to about 25:1<br>
or about 1:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The molar ratio of aldehyde groups in the mono(alkylaldehyde) and<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) to alcohol is about 1:0.2 to about 1:50, or about 1:0.5 to about 1:5 or<br>
about 1:1 to about 1:3.<br>
If guanamine and/or melamine are used in the process, the molar ratio of the<br>
guanamine and/or melamine to the amino compound is about 50:1 to about 1: 50, or<br>
about 20:1 to about 1: 20 or is about 10:1 to about 1:10.<br>
It should be noted that the above reactant amounts are a general guide and the<br>
actual amount of the reactants will depend on the type of reactants and conditions used to<br>
produce the crosslinking composition. Typically, the reaction should be conducted to<br>
prevent gelation, which would have a deleterious effect on the crosslinking composition.<br>
For example, if the amino compounds contain a large number of amino groups, then a<br>
relative small amount of polyfunctional poly(alkylaldehydes) should be used in order to<br>
end-cap with amino groups to prevent an insoluble crosslinked gel from forming.<br>
Conversely, one can charge a large excess of poly(alkylaldehydes) to effectively end-cap<br>
with aldehydes in order to prevent gelation. In addition, higher reaction temperatures<br>
could also tend to lead to self-condensation and possibly gelation. One skilled in the at<br>
would be able to choose the proper reactant amounts and conditions to reduce or<br>
eliminate gel formation.<br>
The above process may be prepared in a one-step or multi-step process. In one<br>
embodiment of a multi-step process, the amino compounds are first reacted with the<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) and/or poly(alkylaldehyde) compounds (alkylolation reaction), and<br>
then the etherification step would occur by the reaction with an alcohol. In another<br>
embodiment of a multistep reaction, the amino compounds are first reacted with a<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) followed by an etherification step, then reacted with a<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) followed by another etherification step.<br><br>
The alkylolation reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a catalyst. An<br>
acid or base catalyst may be used.<br>
Non-limiting examples of acid catalysts are p-toluenesulfonic acid, sulfamic acid,<br>
glacial acetic acid, mono or polychlorinated acetic acids, mono or polyhalogenated acetic<br>
acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, napthylenesulfonic acid, alkyl phosphonic acids,<br>
phosphoric acid and formic acid.<br>
Non-limiting examples of base catalysts are inorganic basic salts such as the<br>
hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and<br>
magnesium, or the organic bases and basic salts such as amines and guanidine,<br>
quaternary-ammonium or phosphonium hydroxide and (bi-)carbonate salts.<br>
The etherification reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst. The same acid catalyst described above for the alkylolation reaction may also<br>
be used in the etherification reaction.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature horn about 0°C to about 125°C, or<br>
about 25°C to about 100°C or about 50oC to about 75°C for a time of about 0.5 hours to<br>
about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours or about 1 hour to about 12 hours.<br>
An important use of the compositions described herein is based on their ability to<br>
act as crosslinking agents in curable compositions, and especially those curable<br>
compositions which contain materials or polymers having active hydrogen groups. The<br>
crosslinkers of the present invention are capable of crosslinking active hydrogen<br>
containing materials or polymers.<br>
The active hydrogen-containing material of the curable compositions preferably<br>
contains at least one class of a reactive functionality such as hydroxy, carboxy, amino,<br>
amido, carbamato, mercapto, or a blocked functionality which is convertible to any of the<br>
preceding reactive functionalities. These active hydrogen-containing materials are those<br>
which are conventionally used in amino resin coatings, and in general are considered<br>
well-known to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.<br>
Suitable active hydrogen-containing materials include, for example, polyfunctional<br>
hydroxy group containing materials such as polyots, hydroxyfunctional acrylic resins<br>
having pendant or terminal hydroxy functionalities, hydroxyfunctional polyester resins<br>
having pendant or terminal hydroxy functionalities, hydroxyfunctional polyurethane<br>
prepolymers, products derived from the condensation of epoxy compounds with an amine<br>
and mixtures thereof. Acrylic and polyester resins are preferred. Examples of the<br>
polyfunctional hydroxy group containing materials include DURAMAC® 203-1385 alkyd<br>
resin (Eastman Chemical Co.); Beckosol® 12035 alkyd resin (Reichhold Chemical Co.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of Glycolur l-Urea Alkylaldehvde Resin<br>
Into a suitable flask was placed 1.5 grams of Na2C03 and 139 grams of water at<br>
room temperature. To the well-stirred solution was added 150 grams of a 50% aqueous<br>
glutaraldehyde solution. The temperature was reduced and maintained at approximately<br>
25°C by cooling in an ice bath whereby 72.5 grams of propionaldehyde and then 35.5<br>
grams of glycoluril was added with stirring. The temperature was then increased to<br>
approximately 35°C and held at that temperature until the solution became clear.<br>
Approximately 30 grams of urea was then added and the reaction was allowed to react fo.<br>
approximately 0.5 hours.<br>
After this time, 250 grams anhydrous MeOH with 2.5 grams of added 97% H2S04<br>
was added to the mixture with stirring, and the temperature was maintained at 25°C (ice<br>
bath) for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then neutralized with 50% NaOH to pH<br>
8 to 8.2. The reaction mixture was ther stripped under good vacuum at a temperature of<br>
about 40° to 50°C to remove all the MeOH and as much water as possible. After stripping,<br>
about 36 grams of propionaldehyde was added and the reaction mixture was warmed to a<br>
temperature of about 40°C.<br><br>
The reaction mixture was then subjected to a second alkylation with 250 grams<br>
anhydrous MeOH with 2.0 grams added H2S04 for approximately 1 hour at 25° to 30°C.<br>
After this period, the batch was neutralized with NaOH to pH 8 to 8.2 and then was<br>
stripped under good vacuum to remove the remaining methanol and water with at a<br>
temperature of about 55° to 60°C. The resin was then adjusted to approximately 60%<br>
solids with 50% by weight ethanol in toluene and filtered free of Na2S04 salts. The resin<br>
had a 13C NMR and IR spectrum, consistent with the expected composition and was<br>
found to contain 69.6% solids.<br>
Example 2. Coating Composition Containing Glycoluril-Urea Alkylaldehyde Resin<br>
A coatings formulation was prepared with the crosslinking resin of Example 1 by<br>
adding 3.0 grams of Dynotol® T-49emp alkyld backbone resin (85% solids in alcohol) to<br>
3.0 grams of the crosslinking resin of Example 1, 0.3 grams of CYCAT® 4040 catalyst<br>
(40.0% para-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in isopropyl alcohol) and 1.0 gram of<br>
acetone solvent. The formulation was applied as a thin film, approximately 2 mils thick,<br>
with a wire wound cator (#52) to iron phosphate treated cold roll steel panels. The panels<br>
were then allowed to cure at room temperature (23° to 25°C) for seven days. The films<br>
did not discolor and had greater than 100 double rubs methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) solvent<br>
resistance. A control panel without the crosslinking resin containing Dynotol T-49emp<br>
plus 0.3 grams of CYCAT 4040 catalyst and 1.0 gram of acetone solvent had less than 3<br>
MEK double rubs solvent resistance and were yellowed.<br>
Example 3. Preparation of Melamine-Urea Alkylaldehyde Resin<br>
To a suitable flask was charged 35 grams of water and 0.50 grams of K2C03. The<br>
resulting solution was warmed to 40°C and 30.0 grams of urea was charged and allowed<br>
to dissolve with good stirring. To this reaction mixture was charged 12.6 grams of<br>
melamine with good stirring. To this slurry was slowly added 40.6 grams of<br>
propionaldehyde keeping the temperature below 55°C to 57°C. After complete addition,<br>
the reaction mixture was refluxed for one hour and then 30.0 grams of 50%<br>
glutaraldehyde was added after cooling to room temperature. After stirring several hours<br>
at room temperature (22° to 25°C), the reaction mixture became homogenous and 135<br>
grams of anhydrous methanol was added and the pH adjusted to 4.3 with 5.5 grams of<br>
70% HN03. The batch was allowed to react at room temperature for about one hour and<br><br>
then the pH was adjusted to 8.1 with 5.5 grams of 50% NaOH. The batch was then<br>
stripped under good vacuum to remove the excess methanol and as much of the water as<br>
possible at a temperature of about 40° to 50°C. To this product was added another 30.0<br>
grams of 50% glutaraldehyde and two drops of 50% NaOH. The mixture was vacuum<br>
stripped until 12.2 grams more of water was removed. To the resulting reaction mixture<br>
was added a second 135 gram of anhydrous methanol with good stirring keeping the<br>
temperature at between 35° to 40°C. To the stirred solution was added 5.0 grams of 70%<br>
HN03 resulting in a pH of approximately 4.0. The reaction was allowed to continue at 35°<br>
to 40°C for 30 minutes and then the pH was adjusted with about 4.4 grams of 50% NaOH<br>
to pH 8.5. The batch was then stripped under good vacuum to remove the excess water<br>
and methanol to a terminating temperature of 50°C. A 1:1 wt/wt toluene-ethanol solvent<br>
was then added to reduce the solids content to 60 wt.%. The mixture was then filtered to<br>
obtain the crosslinking resin. The resin had a 13C NMR and IR spectrum, consistent with<br>
the expected composition and had found solid content of 57.1%.<br>
Example 4. Coating Composition Containing Melamine-Urea Alkylaldehvde Resin<br>
A coatings formulation was made by adding 3.0 grams of Dynotol T-49emp Alkyd<br>
Resin to 3.0 grams to the crosslinking resin of Example 3, 0.3 grams of CYCAT 4040 and<br>
1.5 grams of acetone solvent. A thin film (approximately 2 mils) was applied to iron-<br>
phosphate treated cold rolled steel panels and allowed to cure for seven days at room<br>
temperature (23° to 25°C). The films did not discolor and had greater than 180 MEK<br>
double rub solvent resistance. A control formulation with no crosslinker discolored and<br>
had no solvent resistance.<br>
Example 5. Preparation of Glycoluril Alkylaldehyde Resin<br>
To a suitable flask was charged 0.6 grams of Na2C03 and 10.0 grams of water.<br>
To this stirred solution at approximately 22°C was added 116 grams of propionaldehyde<br>
and 20.0 grams of water. To the we! -stirred reaction mixture was added 14.2 grams of<br>
glycoluril. The mixture was allowed to stir at about 25°C for 4.5 hours after which time<br>
virtually all the glycoluril had reacted and dissolved. To the stirred reaction mixture was<br>
added 20 grams of 50% aqueous glutaraldehyde and the mixture was allowed to stir at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours. After his time, excess propionaldehyde was removed from<br>
the batch by slight vacuum distillation with a terminal temperature of approximately 35°C.<br><br>
To the remainder or the batch was charged 100 grams of anhydrous MeOH containing 1.0<br>
gram of 97% H2S04 slowly, keeping the temperature between about 15° to 20°C with a<br>
cold water bath. After complete addition, the batch was warmed to 22° to 25°C and<br>
allowed to stir for one hour. The pH was then adjusted with 1.55 grams of 50% NaOH to<br>
pH 8.5 and stripped under good vacuum to remove nearly all excess MeOH and water at<br>
terminating temperature of 45°C. The reaction mixture was then subjected to a second<br>
alkylation with another 100 grams of methanol containing 1.33 grams of 97% H2S04. The<br>
batch was then allowed to stir for one hour after which 1.44 grams of 50% NaOH was<br>
added adjusting the pH to 8.5. The batch was then stripped free of excess MeOH and<br>
water under good vacuum with terminating temperature of about 50°C. The batch was<br>
then adjusted to approximately 50% solids with 1:1 (wt/wt) ethanol-toluene solvent mixture<br>
and filtered to obtain the crosslinking resin. The resulting resin a 13C NMR and IR<br>
spectrum, consistent with the expected composition and was found to be 47.4% solids.<br>
