				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
This invention relates to a mobile kitchen for preparing and dispensing various items of food, such as, sweet corn, fries and other edibles, and which can be moved about from place to place for dping business.<br>
This invention provides mobility for doing business in the said edibles from one location to another.<br>
It also provides means for carrying, among other things, a stove, utensils, water, disposable cups, plates, apart from provisions for preparing such edibles.<br>
This invention enables the aforementioned articles to be carried about without any damage while being mobile.<br>
This invention can be parked in stable condition while doing business and enables the said articles tp be used easily and effortlessly.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description.<br>
The mobile kitchen, Regarding to this invention, Comprises a box for containing cooking apparatus, the box being provided with a lid, the lid being extensible to provide a table top; a source of fuel for the cooking apparatus attached tp the box a wheeled stand provided for the box, said stand being detachably fixed to the box; a canopy structure with telescoping columns and a canopy for being raised or lowered oyer the box.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of this invention,<br>
A box 01 with lid 03 has a canopy 02 which sits on top of the box. The stand 04 is attached to the bottom of the box.<br>
The stand 04 has four legs 23. Each leg has a wheel 06. The four legs are connected by three tubular members 07.<br>
The canopy slEBWgp 02 has canopy structure 10 and two telescopic columns 11. enabling the canopy to be raised and lowered when necessary. The canopy shields the box against the sun. The box has a handle 12.<br>
Speakers 13 for playing music and lights 14 for illumination while doing business in the dark are attached to the canopy structure . Water cans 15 are placed against the box. The box provides for holding steamer 21 and fryer 22 compartments.<br>
The canopy has guides 16 on to the box 01. There is a handle 17 and lock 18 provided on the lid 03. Box 01 has guides 20 for stand P4. Box 01 provides space for gas stove J 9. Hook 24 is provided under the box on left as well as right side. Four cross pins 25 are provided for stand. Two cross pins 26 are provided for canopy structure. Two sets of stays 27 and guides 28 are provided for lid.<br><br>
The embodiment functions as a compact mobile kitchen. The items for sale are kept inside the box 01 and held securely to prevent falling off.<br>
The steamer and fryer compartments are kept in the recesses provided on top of the box. Also spaoe is provided for specific utensils for keeping spices and mixing steamed corn or fries. The steamer and fryer compartments are heated by portable gas stoves kept inside the box. Cups, plates, salable items are stowed in the box by opening the lid provided at rear of the box. These items are kept under lock which is fixed to the lid,<br>
For doing business, the stand is dropped from the bpx after releasing from the hooks provided on left and right side of the vehicle, The stand is held in dropped condition by fixing cross pins. All the four legs drop simultaneously as they are connected by three tubular members. Also the stand is stowed partially in the box by lifting up and engaging cross pins,<br>
The canopy structure is in closed condition sitting on the top of the box. For doing business, it will be moved up using the two telescopic columns. The canopy is kept at extended position using two cross pins. To lower the canopy on to the box, the cross pins are removed and the telescopic column is pushed into the bpx.<br>
When doing business, t|$ yjfndor extends the top area of #$ box which functions as table top by opening the lid and rotating it to horizontal condition to match the top surface of the box. It is kept in that condition by using two stays and two registers.<br><br>
t<br>
The sides of the box and canopy provide space for branding and<br>
advertisements.<br>
The embodiment functions as a mobile kitGhen which is compact and<br>
extendable for doing business.<br>
■ -■	' \* * ' .,<br>
The vendor fills the cans with water. He travels to different places by pushing the box on the wheeled stand and parks the same where there are potential customers, He conducts his business and moves to fresh locations or home after selling.<br>
Currently the mobile vending business is done using head loads, push carts and cycles, Such manner of doing business does not create good ambience aind convenience to customers and vendors. This does not provide an aesthetic feel to the customers in a visual and hygienic sense. Also, this way of selling does not provide means to exhibit brands of wares and identity of the manufacturer as in the present case when the canopy can be used for exhibiting branded products and the identity of manufacturers of such products. This invention provides an elegant solution where the seller need not invest and incijr costs involved in renting a shop.<br>
When the embodiment is closed, it is compact enough to be moved on the ground on the wheeled stand. When open, it becomes a stand alone kiosk.<br>
The embodiment has it's own brand identity and cannot be mistaken for some other device or equipment. This will provide very good recognition for the vendor who is operating in the field.<br><br>
As it is on the move, the embodiment is a good bill board for corporate advertising.<br>
The food grade stainless steel material used for the top of the box and lid provides hygienic surfaces for food and drinks.<br>
The embodiment can be easily operated, used and maintained by the seller. The canopy can be raised and lowered with minimum effort on telescoping columns. Also the stand can be lowered or stowed away easily.<br>
The seller can avail loan schemes/ micro loans with low monthly payments This will provide means for earning to the unemployed.<br>
It will be appreciated that this invention is not confined to the embodiment illustrated and described but that various other emodiments are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
