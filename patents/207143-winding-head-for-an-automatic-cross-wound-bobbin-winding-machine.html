DESCRIPTION	<br>
The invention relates to a winding head for a cross-wound bobbIN winDing machine,<br>
Winding heads of this kind are known in conjunction with automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machines, and are described in detail, for example, in the manual for the "Autoconer 238" from Messrs. W. Schlafhorst AG &amp; Co., printing date 06.89, on pages 01.2.7 and 01.6.6 f f. respectively.<br>
Even if these automatic cross-wound bobbin winding devices have proved their worth in practice many times over, and have been successfully in use for a considerable time, difficulties do sometimes still arise when unwound empty bobbin holders are ejected from the winding heads.<br>
In particular, with the known winding heads it cannot always be guaranteed that the empty bobbin holders ejected will be carried away in an orderly manner, i.e. oriented in the correct way onto the bobbin holder conveyor belt arranged in front of the winding heads.<br>
The object of the invention Is therefore to improve the known winding heads in such a way that the proper transfer will be guaranteed of unwound empty bobbin holders onto an empty bobbin holder conveyor belt arranged in front of the winding heads.<br>
This objective is achived according to achived according to the invention by a winding head head       <br><br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Other advantageous embodiment of the invention of the invention form the object of the <br>
The additional  holder guide device  in the area of at least one of the slip flaps, which is arranged so as to pivot, has the advantage that the empty bobbin holder which is ejected by the winding head ejector device, and which as a rule is fully unwound, is supported laterally on the bobbin holder guide device during the ejection process, and it can therefore be ensured that the empty bobbin holders will be carried out orientated correctly on the empty bobbin holder conveyor belt.<br>
This means that the bobbin holder guide device prevents the possibility of an empty bobbin holder remaining in the area of the opened slip flaps, which might therefore not only prevent the replacement of a new spinning cop, but might also interfere with the conveying of the empty bobbin holder on the empty bobbin holder conveyor.<br>
In addition to this, the empty bobbin holder guide device according to the invention also guarantees that the empty bobbin holders will be conducted back properly to the ring spinning machine, since the bobbin holder guide device will ensure that the holders maintain the same positional orientation during the return movement, so that no conveying bottlenecks occur in the area of the downstream ascending conveyor due to empty bobbin holders being wrongly oriented.<br>
For  preference,  the  bobbins-holder  guide  device  is<br>
formed,  as demonstrated by a deflection<br>
panel secured to a slip flap,or,<br>
  by an appropriately shaped guide bar.	<br>
Both the deflection panel and the guide bar perceptibly project beyond the slip flap concerned, in the direction<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
of the bobbin holder conveying device, and so provide reliable lateral guidance for the empty bobbin holders which are being ejected.<br>
In the case of conical bobbin holders, in this context a design form is to be preferred in which the bobbin holder guide device is arranged at the front slip flap in the conveying direction of the empty bobbin holder conveying device. An arrangement such as this guarantees that conical bobbin holders are always transferred to the downstream conveyor belt in such a way that they point with the small bobbin holder diameter in the conveying direction. A positional orientation such as this, which is maintained during the whole of the return conveying of the empty bobbin holders, has proved to be particularly advantageous for downstream conveying devices, in particular for ascending conveyors, which raise the bobbin holders onto a higher conveying level.<br>
Further  details  of  the  invention  are  provided<br>
hereinafter, on the basis of an embodiment explained in the accompanying drawings.<br>
These show:<br>
Fig. 1 A perspective view of an automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machine, of which the winding heads, equipped with circular batteries, feature the bobbin holder guide device according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 A side view of a winding head with a bobbin holder guide device arranged at a slip flap,<br>
Fig. 3 To a larger scale, the slip flaps of a winding head, with a bobbin holder guide device in the area of the slip flap located in front in the<br><br>
- 4 -conveying direction.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of an automatic cross-wound bobbin winding device 1, which, as is usual, features a large number of winding heads 2 arranged in a row next to one another. As is indicated, each of the winding heads 2 features a circular battery 3, for accommodating spinning cops 4.<br>
The spinning cops 4 mounted in the circular batteries 3 are transferred by means of a cop guide device, consisting of a cop shaft 16, pivotable slip flaps 5, and centering flaps 6, likewise mounted so as to be movable, into an unwinding position II of the individual winding head in each case, in which they are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 7.<br>
The unwound empty bobbin holders 8 are then removed via the opened slip flaps 5 into an empty bobbin holder conveying device 9. Connected to the bobbin conveying device 9, circulating in the conveying direction T, is a further conveying device, such as an ascending conveyor 10, which transfers the empty bobbin holders 8 onto a higher conveying plane. From there, the empty bobbin holders 8 are conveyed back to a ring spinning machine (not represented).<br>
During the whole of the return conveying movement, the empty bobbin holders 8 are orientated into position; i.e. the conical bobbin holders 8 are aligned on the conveying devices 9, 10 in such a way that they point in the conveying direction T- with their small bobbin diameter.<br>
As indicated in Figure 2, each of the inherently known winding heads 2 of the automatic cross-wound bobbin winder 1 is provided with a circular battery 3 for the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
deposition of spinning cops 4, a winding device	11 for<br>
winding cross-wound bobbins 7,  an electronic	thread<br>
cleaner 12, a splicing device 13, and a	thread<br>
tensioning device 30.<br>
The splicing device 13 is guided by means of a suction nozzle 14 and a gripper tube 15 to the thread ends which are to be connected. Because the structure and function of such winding heads are generally known, no further explanation need be provided.<br>
The spinning cops 4 accommodated in the circular batteries 3 are transferred by means of cop guide media, such as a cop shaft 16, the slip flaps 5, and the centering flaps 6, onto a cop arbour 17, which is capable of pivoting between a front cop acceptance and discharge position I and an unwinding position II. Also arranged in the area of the arbour 17 is an ejection device 27 capable of separate actuation.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the slip flaps 5 and the centering flaps 6 are connected by means of a bracket 18 to the winding head housing 19. This means that the slip flaps 5 are connected to the bracket 18 by means of pivot axles 20, and can be actuated by means of a linkage assembly 21. The centering flaps 6 are in each case connected by means of pivot axles 22 to the bracket 18, and are likewise capable of defined actuation by means of a lever arrangement 23.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3 in particular, a bobbin holder guide device 24 is arranged at one of the slip flaps 5, for preference at the slip flap 5' located in the front in the conveying direction T, the said bobbin holder guide element being designed either as a deflector panel 25 or as a guide bar 26.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Actuation of the slip flaps 5, the centering flaps 6, the cop arbour 17, and the ejector 27 is effected in this case by means of an inherently known device (not shown) referred to as an automatic cop changer.<br>
An automatic cop changer of this kind, which is provided, for example, with a curved disk arrangement subjected to the force of an electric motor, is described in relatively great detail in the manual referred to in the Preamble, "Autoconer 238", on pages 01.6.1 ff.<br>
The device according to the invention works in principle as follows:<br>
The winding head computer (not shown) of a winding head 2 initiated a cop change when the spinning cop 4 positioned on the cop arbour 17 has run out, or the thread beneath the measuring slot of the electronic thread cleaner 12 has been torn, and, as a result, the dynamic and static thread signal is no longer present. In the course of this cop change, the bobbin holder 8 is scraped off the arbour 17, a new spinning cop 4 is called up from the circular battery 3, and positioned in the unwinding position II.<br>
This means that, for a cop change, the winding head computer of the winding head 2 additionally switches on an automatic cop change device, in addition to an automatic thread connecting device.<br>
The automatic cop changing device pivots over a curved disk packet, which is subjected to force by a drive motor, to which a number of lever linkages are connected, among others also the linkage arrangement 21 for the slip flaps 5, 5', and the lever arrangement 23 for  the  centering  flaps  6,  the  cop  arbour  17  for<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
scraping off the empty bobbin holder 8, and for accepting a new spinning cop 4 into the ejection and fitting position I.<br>
During this pivoting motion, a tensioning lever integrated in the cop arbour 17 is released from the empty bobbin holder 8, and pivots into the arbour 17, with the result that the empty bobbin holder 8 is clamped on the arbour 17 in the position I, for ejection or fitting respectively, and the ejector 27 can scrape the empty bobbin holder 8 off the arbour 17 without any problem.<br>
in order to eject the empty bobbin holder 8, a curved disk raises the ejector 27 by means of a downstream lever linkage (not shown), in such a way that the empty bobbin holder 8 is scraped off the arbour 17, and is transferred through the opened slip flaps 5, 5' onto the bobbin holder conveyor device 9.<br>
The empty bobbin holder 8 is reliably conducted, during the ejection process, to the bobbin holder guide device 24 according to the invention, and, as a result, falls orientated into the correct position onto the bobbin holder conveying device 9; i.e., in the case of conical bobbin holders, the small bobbin holder diameter always points in the direction of conveying T.<br>
Once it has reached its highest point, the ejector 27 pivots back under the force of a tractive spring into its initial position. Once the ejector 27 has scraped the empty bobbin holder 8 off the arbour 17, and has again pivoted back into its initial position, the half-opened slip flaps 5 close into their original settings, as do the centering flaps 6, and form a hopper for a new spinning cop 4.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
While the slip flaps 5 are closing, the circular battery 3 is actuated to transfer a spinning cop 4 to the arbour<br>
17.<br>
The inherently-known circular battery 3 carries a spinning cop 4 in each of the compartments of one of its wings. The wing of the battery is mounted so as to be capable of rotation, and, when the spinning cop is changed, rotates in each case by one compartment further, in which situation a compartment is connected to a cop shaft 16. The new spinning cop 4 slides via the cop shaft 16, the closed slip flaps 5, and the positioned centering flaps 6, onto the arbour 17 positioned in the cop mounting position.<br>
Once the new spinning cop 4 has been fitted onto the arbour, the slip and centering flaps 4, 5, actuated by the curved disks, pivot back into their original position.<br>
In addition to this, the mounting arbour 17, with the new spinning cop 4, pivots into the winding position II.<br>
The thread referred to as the underthread or bottom thread, deriving from the spinning cop 4, is connected in the splicing device 12 with the thread referred to as the upper thread or face thread, which is recovered from the cross-wound bobbin 7, and a new winding process is started.<br>
Once the newly-inserted spinning cop 4 has been unwound, the cop change cycle described heretofore is repeated.<br><br>
