[Document Name] Specification [Title of the Invention] LIGHT [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a light that includes a light source, a lens, a reflector, and a hood which shields part of the light emitted from the light source. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
A vehicle is provided with a headlight, which illuminates ahead of the vehicle at night and the like. As shown in Fig. 17, a headlight 500 is basically formed of a light source 502, a lens 504, and a reflector 506. [0003]<br>
The headlight 500 is sometimes provided with a hood (also referred to as a shade) 508, which shields part of the light emitted from the light source, so as not to directly project ahead when the emitted light is strong, or in other similar cases (see, for example, patent document 1). [0004]<br>
The hood 508 is formed of a light shielding part 510, which is provided in front of the light source 502, and a supporting part 512, which supports the light shielding part 510. The supporting part 512 is in an elongated shape. One end of the supporting part 512 is connected to the light shielding part 510 while the other end thereof is connected to part of the reflector 506. [0005]<br><br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2000-90711<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0006]<br>
As shown in Fig. 17, the light shielding part 510 of the hood 508 is connected to part of the reflector 506 with the supporting part 512 therebetween. Incidentally, in the part where the supporting part 512 is connected to the reflector 506, an edge 512a of the supporting part 512 is slightly bent so as to fit to the reflecting surface of the reflector 506, and is fixed to the reflector 506.<br>
[0007]<br>
When the edge 512a is bent for the fixation as described above, a certain area of the reflecting surface of the reflector 506 is covered with the edge 512a thus fixed thereto. Accordingly, the surface of the area is wasted, and thereby the reflecting performance of the reflector 506 is deteriorated. Further, the portion on which the edge 512a is bent can be seen from the front side thereof. In addition, a process, such as welding or adhesive bonding, is necessary to fix the edge 512a to the reflector 506. Accordingly, the fixing of the edge 512a is complicated, and the edge 512a is basically non-detachable. [0008]<br>
The present invention is made in view of the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a light in which a reflecting surface can be used even more effectively by having a reduced area, for the fixation<br><br>
of a hood, on the surface of a reflector, and for which an exterior appearance can be enhanced. [Means for Solving the Problems] [0009]<br>
A light of the present invention includes a light source, a lens, a reflector, and a hood for shielding part of light emitted from the light source and has the following aspects. [0010]<br>
A first aspect; The hood includes a light shielding part provided in front of the light source, and a supporting part, which supports the light shielding part; and the supporting part is inserted into an opening portion provided to the reflector. [0011]<br>
As described above, the supporting part is inserted into the opening portion provided to the reflector, whereby the area of the surface to be wasted for attaching the hood is reduced. In this way, the reflection surface can -be used even more effectively, and, at the same time, the exterior performance can be enhanced. [0012]<br>
A second aspect: The supporting part is fixed to a portion other than a reflection surface of the reflector using a fixing member. With this fixing member, the support medium can be fixed even more securely without reducing the area of reflecting surface of the reflector. [0013]<br>
A third aspect: Wedge portions are provided to the supporting part and the opening portion, the wedge portions<br><br>
being for engaging the supporting part and the opening portion with each other, whereby preventing the supporting part and the opening portion from being separated from each other. With the wedge portions, the supporting part can be fixed easily only by inserting the supporting part into the opening portion. [0014]<br>
A forth aspect: Part of the supporting part is passed through the opening portion, and the protruding part of the supporting part is bent.  Thus, the supporting part can be easily and more securely fixed. [0015]<br>
A fifth aspect: The light includes a fixture and a rod like member that are for fixing the supporting part. A fixation opening is provided in the vicinity of the front edge of the supporting part. The fixture includes an attachment part being attached to part of the reflector, a receiving opening into which the front edge of the supporting part is inserted, and a vertical opening portion which is provided, at a position corresponding to the fixation opening, approximately perpendicularly to the extending direction of the receiving opening, and into which the rod-like member is inserted. The use of such a fixture enables easy and secure fixation of the supporting part. [0016]<br>
A sixth aspect: The reflector includes a main reflector having a concave portion, and a sub-reflector which is attached to the concave portion, and which forms a continuous reflection surface along with the main reflector. The hood includes a<br><br>
light shielding part provided in front of the light source, a supporting part which supports the light shielding part. One end of the supporting part is fixed to the concave portion, and the one end is covered with the sub-reflector. [0017]<br>
As described above, the supporting part is fixed in the convex portion, and the convex portion is covered with the sub-reflector. Accordingly, the reflection surface of the reflector is not substantially reduced, and, further, the exterior performance can be enhanced. [Effects of the Invention] [0018]<br>
According to the light of the present invention, the supporting part is inserted into the opening portion provided to the reflector, so that the surface to be wasted for attaching the hood can be reduced. Accordingly, the reflection surface can be used more effectively, and the exterior performance can be enhanced. [0019]<br>
In addition, according to the light of the present invention, the supporting part is fixed in the convex portion, and the convex portion is covered with the sub-reflector. Accordingly, the area of the reflection surface of the reflector is not substantially reduced, and, further, the exterior performance can be enhanced. [Best Mode for carrying out the Invention] [0020]<br><br>
An embodiment of the light of the present invention is described below with reference to the accompanying Figs. 1 to 16. A headlight (light) of the present invention is mounted on a motorcycle 10. First, a description will be given of the motorcycle 10. [0021]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the motorcycle 10 is a motor scooter, and includes, at the front end thereof, front fork 25 which rotatably supports the front wheel WF, and a head tube 27 which supports a handlebar 26 connected to the front fork 25 so that the handlebar 26 is steerable. The motorcycle 10 also includes a unit swing engine UE for supporting the rear wheel WR at the rear end, the unit swing engine US being supported in the middle part of the body frame F in a manner of being able to oscillate up and down. A fuel tank 28 and a radiator 29 that is disposed in the position posterior to the fuel tank 28 are mounted on the body frame F in the position anterior to the unit swing engine UE. To a back part of the body frame F, disposed is a tandem-type rider's seat 31 which includes a front seat 32 and a rear seat 33 . Further, a body cover 34 made of synthetic resin is attached to the body frame F, the body cover 34 covering the body frame F, a front part of the unit swing engine UE, the fuel tank 28, and the radiator 29. [0022]<br>
The unit swing engine UE is formed of a water-cooled engine E and a belt continuously-variable transmission M. The water-cooled engine E has the axis of the cylinder approximately horizontal, and the belt continuously-variable transmission M<br><br>
transmits an output of the engine E to the rear wheel WR after having the gear continuously changed with a transmission belt and a pulley. The continuously variable transmission M continuously changes the transmission gear ratio by driving, in response to the operation of an electric motor 42 for gear change, the movable pulley provided on the side of a crankshaft, [0023]<br>
A transmission case 43 of the continuously variable transmission M is provided successively to the left side of a crankcase 44 of the engine E so that the transmission case 43 extends from the engine E to the left side. A swing arm not shown is connected at the front end to the right side of the crankcase 44, and the rear wheel WR is rotatably supported between the rear end of the transmission case and the rear end of the swing arm. [0024]<br>
Further, a pair of left and right rear cushions 64 is connected at the upper ends to the rear end of the body frame F, and both of the rear cushions 64 are connected at the lower ends to the rear end of the transmission case 43 and the rear end of the swing arm. [0025]<br>
The motorcycle 10 is provided with a main stand 66 and a side stand 68 to keep the motorcycle 10 stand while parking. [0026]<br>
Under the rider's seat 31, a housing box 70 for housing goods is provided, and extends from the lower front end of the rider's seat 31 to the vicinity of an upper parts of the rear<br><br>
cushions 64.  The rider's seat 31 serves also as a lid for covering the upper surface of the housing box 70, and the interior space is exposed by lifting the rider' s seat 31 to the right side. [0027]<br>
A front cowl 7 6 of the body cover 34 includes a transparent windshield 78 in an upper part, and a pair of left and right rearview mirrors 80. An inner cover 82 includes a leg shield 84 covering front portions of the legs of a rider, and step holders 86. The step holders 86 are disposed to the positions adjacent to the rear part of a center cover 88 and attached so that a pillion steps 90 on which a passenger puts his/her feet can be housed or exposed. [0028]<br>
A front part of the body cover 34 forms the front cowl 76. The front cowl 76 is formed into a smooth curved surface being narrower toward the front edge, and entirely covers a middle portion of the handlebar, a meter unit 126, the head tube 27, and the lice provided in a front portion of the motorcycle 10. [0029]<br>
The front cowl 76 includes a center garnish 102, a side portion 104 extending to the left and right sides, and the windshield 78 provided to an upper part of the center garnish 102. The center garnish 102 and the windshield 7 8 are integrally and smoothly connected, so that wind created during riding easily flows from the center garnish 102 to the windshield 78.<br><br>
The center garnish 102 includes a headlight lOO of a first embodiment which is provided to the center front edge, a direction indicator lamps 110 provided on the left and right sides at slightly elevated positions, a wind introduction port 112 provided to the upper part of the headlight 100a, and a pair of small wind introduction ports 114 provided on the left and right sides at the front edge. As the method of fixing the headlight 100a, a method in which the headlight 100a is not interlocked with the handlebar 26 is applied. [0031]<br>
The method of fixing the headlight 100a is not limited to the one in which the headlight 100a is not interlocked with the handlebar 26, but may be one, as shown in Fig. 3, in which the headlight 100a is provided to a top cover 120 covering a front portion of the handlebar 26, and turns along with the steering of the handlebar 100a. Further, as shown 4, the headlight 100a may be entirely exposed. The headlight 100a may be replaced by one used for a four-wheeled vehicle or the like. [0032]<br>
Next,  the headlight  100a according to the  first embodiment  is described in detail.   In the  following description, an arrow Al indicates the forward direction, and an arrow A2 indicates the backward direction. [0033]<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the headlight 100a includes a bulb (a light source) 150, a dish-like reflector 150 which is provided around the bulb 150 and reflects light in the forward<br><br>
direction, a lens 15,4 which is provided to the front surface, and a case 156 which is provided to the reflector 152 and supports the bulb 150 and the lens 154. To the matching surface of the reflector 152 and the lens 154, a seal 157 is provided. In the headlight 100a, position lights 160 are provided on the left and right sides of the bulb 150. [0034]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the reflector 152 is fixed to the base part of the bulb 150 and part of the case 156.  The headlight 100a is fixed to the vehicle body with a screw 162, [0035]<br>
The  reflector  152  and  the  lens  154  form  a hermetically-sealed light chamber.  The bulb 150 is provided in the light chamber 158 and fixed at the rear portion to the case 156-[0036]<br>
The bulb 150 is turned on and off under an operation of a light switch not shown or of a predetermined controller. The bulb 150 only needs to be a luminous body having a sufficient amount of light, and may be a light emitting diode (LED), an electroluminescence (EL), or the like. [0037]<br>
Further, the headlight 100a includes a hood 17 0 which shields part of light emitted from the bulb 150. [0038]<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the hood 170 includes a light shielding part 172, which is provided in front of the bulb 150, and a supporting part 174, which supports the light shielding<br><br>
part 172. The light shielding part 172 has a substantially truncated cone shape including a tapered portion which is tapered in the forward direction. With this light shielding part 172, the light traveling toward the forward direction, which is part of light emitted from the bulb ISO, is shielded. [0039]<br>
In this way, with the hood 170, direct and excessively strong light emitted from the bulb 150 toward the forward direction is selectively shielded, and thereby, glare can be prevented. Accordingly, the light does not make a person illuminated with the light discomfort. Further, no direct exposure of the bulb 150 improves the external appearance. [0040]<br>
The supporting part 174 is formed of a thin plate, and the front end is connected to an upper part of the light shielding part 172 while the rear end is connected to the reflector 152. The supporting part 174 may be connected to other portion of the light shielding part 172 than the upper portion thereof (refer to Figs. 9 and 11). [0041]<br>
The supporting part 174 is formed in an elongated shape, and rarely shields light emitted from the bulb 150. [0042]<br>
As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the supporting part 174 is formed of a main portion 176 and a narrow portion 178, which is provided to the rear end. The narrow portion 178 is integrally provided to a back part of the main portion 176, and formed so that the narrow portion 178 is slightly narrower than the main portion<br><br>
17 6. In this manner, the width of the supporting part 174 varies in the middle, whereby a step is formed. Accordingly, when inserting the supporting part 174 into an opening portion 190 as described later, the amount of the supporting part 174 to be inserted to the opening portion 190 is simply and securely defined. [0043]<br>
The main portion 176 includes two gently bent portions to suitably maintain the position and direction of the light shielding part 172 relative to the position of an attachment part 180 for the reflector 152. [0044]<br>
The narrow portion 178 includes convex wedge portions (wedge portions) 182, which protrude to the left and right sides at a position slightly forward of the center part of the narrow portion 178, and concave portions 184, which are provided on the left and right sides at a position slightly backward of the center part of the narrow portion 178. The convex wedge portions 182 have a wedge-like shape so that the convex wedge portion 182 is wide in the front and becomes narrower toward the back. [0045]<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 and 8, the attachment part 180 is formed thicker than other portions in the reflector 152, and includes an opening portion 190 which is communicated from the reflection surface provided in the front to the surface at the rear end. The opening portion 190 is as thin as the thickness the supporting part 174, and is formed into a shape so that part<br><br>
of the main portion 176 and the narrow portion 178 can be inserted The opening portion 190 is set to be slightly thinner and narrower than the supporting part 174, and the supporting part 174 is pushed into the opening portion 190. In this way, the supporting part 174 is to be securely fixed, and at the same time a waterproof function and a dustproof function are provided The opening portion 190 is not necessarily passed through to the back, and when the opening portion 190 is not passed through, the waterproof function and the dustproof function are enhanced. [0046]<br>
In the narrow portion 178 the short rear end portion 186 of the narrow portion 178, which is in back of the convex portion 184, is passed through the opening portion 190, and the convex portions 184 are disposed to the rear end surface of the reflector 152. The rear end portion 186, which is passed through the opening portion 190 and protruded therefrom, is bent at substantially 90" (refer to Fig. 6) so as to contact with the rear end surface of the reflector 152. Accordingly, the supporting part 174 can be easily and securely fixed. The rear end portion 186 can be easily bent with the convex portions 184 . For the sake of easy understanding. Figs. 7 and 8 (and Fig. 10 to be described later) show a state before the rear end portion 186 is bent. [0047]<br>
Further, the opening portion 190 includes concave wedge portions 192, which are recessed on the left and right sides, at positions corresponding to the convex wedge portions 182.<br><br>
The shapes of the concave wedge portions 192 correspond to those of the convex wedge portions 182, and are each in a wedge shape having the front part being wide, which becomes narrower toward the end. Only by inserting (pressing) the supporting part 174 into the opening portion 190, the convex wedge portions 182 and the concave wedge portions 192 are made engaged with each other, which prevents the supporting part 174 from being pulled out. Accordingly, the supporting part 174 can be fixed easily. [0048]<br>
With the headlight 100a configured in this manner, the surface that is wasted for the fixation of the supporting part 174 in the conventional technique (refer to reference numeral 512a of Fig. 17) does not substantially exist since the supporting part 174 is inserted into the opening portion 190 provided to the reflector 152. Accordingly, the reflection surface of the reflector 152 can be used even more effectively. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, since there is no surface wasted for the fixation, the exterior performance can be enhanced. [0049]<br>
In addition, the fixing of the supporting part 174 is completed only by inserting the supporting part 174 into the opening portion 190 and then bending the rear end 186. Since a process, such as welding or adhesive bonding, is not necessary, the fixing is thus simple. It is natural that, depending on a design condition, welding, adhesive bonding, or the like may be performed on part of the supporting part 174. [0050]<br><br>
Subsequently, a headlight 100b according to a second embodiment is described with reference to Figs. 9 and 10. The same reference numerals are given to the parts which have similar configurations to those of the headlight 100a, and detailed descriptions for those parts are omitted* [0051]<br>
In comparison with the headlight 100a, the headlight 100b is different in the shapes of the lens 154 and the reflector 152. In addition, the head light 100b is different from the headlight 100a also in that the attachment part 180 is provided below, and in that the supporting part 174 is fixed by use of a tapping screw (a fixing member) 194. [0052]<br>
Accordingly, a small hole (a fixing hole) 196 is provided to the approximately center of a part of the supporting part 174, the part being to be inserted into the opening portion 190. A vertical hole 198 is provided to the attachment part 180 at a position corresponding to the small hole 196 so that the vertical aperture 198 is substantially perpendicular to a surface of the supporting part 174, The vertical hole 198 is opened to a lower surface. The tapping screw 194 is screwed into the vertical hole 198 and the small hole 196, whereby the supporting part 174 is fixed even more securely. Further, as can be made clear from Fig. 9, the supporting part 174 is fixed, by use of the tapping screw 194, on a portion other than the reflection surface of the reflector 152. Accordingly, the area of the refection surface of the reflector is not reduced.<br><br>
Further, the small hole 196 (and a small aperture 201 to be described later) may be a cutout or the like.  The tapping screw 194 may be other bar-like member which is pushed into or screwed into the small hole 196. [0054]<br>
Next, a headlight 100c according to a third embodiment is described with reference to Figs. 11 to 13. [0055]<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the headlight 100c is different from the headlight 100a in the shapes of the lens 154 and the reflector 152. The head light 100c is different also in that the attachment part 180 is provided below, and in that the supporting part 174 is fixed by use of a fixture 200 and a tapping screw 194. The fixture 200 is attached to the back of the attachment part 180. [0056]<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, a small hole (a fixing hole) 201 is provided to the approximately center of a part of the supporting part 174, the part being protruding from the opening portion 190. To this supporting part 174, a convex portion 184 (refer to Fig. 8) is not provided. [0057]<br>
As shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the fixture 200 has a box shape with the front side opened, and is provided with a mounting part 202 to be mounted on the attachment part 180, a receiving hole 204 into which a rear portion 186 of the supporting part 174 is inserted. A vertical hole 206 is also provided to the fixture 200 at the position corresponding to a small hole 186<br><br>
of the rear portion 186 inserted into the receiving hole 204 so that the vertical hole 206 is substantially perpendicular to a surface of the supporting part (i.e. substantially perpendicular to an extending direction of the receiving hole 204). The mounting part 202 is formed in a square hole shape in which the attachment part 180 can be inserted, and is provided with a guide rib 202a to the inside so that the attachment part 180 is correctly inserted. The mounting part 202 is set to be at the same height as the rear opening of the opening portion 190 and to have the same thickness and same width as the rear end of the opening portion 190. The vertical hole 206 is opened to a rear part of the lower surface of the fixture 200. The small hole 201 and the vertical hole 206 have the same shapes as the small hole 196 and the vertical hole 198, respectively. [0058]<br>
In the case of the headlight 100c, the supporting part 174 is pressed (inserted) into the aperture 190, and thereafter the fixture 200 is attached to the attachment part 180 from the behind. Thus, the rear end 186 is inserted into the receiving hole 204 of the fixture 200, and the small hole 201 and the vertical hole 206 are disposed to the positions where the small hole 201 and the vertical hole 206 can have the same axis. Next, a tapping screw 194 is screwed into the vertical hole 206, thereby the supporting part 174 is simply and securely fixed to the attachment part 180 and to the fixture 200. By use of the fixture 200, the waterproof function and the dustproof function are improved since the receiving hole 204 is not communicated with the back side of the fixture 200.<br><br>
Next, a headlight lOOd according to a forth embodiment is described with reference to Figs. 14 to 16. [0060]<br>
As shown in Figs. 14 to 16, the headlight lOOd is different from the headlight lOOa in that a concave portion 210 is formed in a part of the reflector 152, and in that a sub-reflector 212 is attached to the concave portion 210. To the sub-reflector 212, a wedge-shaped lever 212a is provided, which makes it possible for the reflector 152 to be fixed to the concave portion 210 securely with the lever 212a. The front surface of the sub-reflector 212 is a reflection surface, and forms a continuous and smooth reflection surface along with the reflector 152. Hence, in the case of the headlight lOOd, the reflector 152 works as a main reflector to the sub-reflector 212. [0061]<br>
In the back of the concave part 210, the attachment part 216 with a lateral hole 214 is provided.  The lateral hole 214 has a bottom, and thus has excellent waterproof and dustproof functions. [0062]<br>
A rear portion (one end portion) 218 of the support medium 174 is bent upward at an approximately right angle, and a small hole 220 is provided at a position facing the lateral hole 214. A tapping screw 194 is screwed into the small hole 220 and the lateral hole 214, so that the supporting part 174 is securely<br><br>
fixed. The supporting part 174 may be fixed by means of welding,<br>
adhesive boding, or the like.<br>
[0063]<br>
The sub-reflector 212 is attached from the front after fixing the rear portion 218 of the supporting part 174 with the tapping screw 194. Thus, the sub-reflector 212 forms a continuous reflection surface along with the reflector 152, and the concave portion 210 and the rear portion 218 are covered with the sub-reflector 212. [0064]<br>
In the above-described headlight lOOd, the supporting part 174 is fixed at the concave portion 210, and the concave portion is covered with the sub-reflector 212. Accordingly, the reflector 152 is supplemented by the sub-reflector 212, and hence the exterior performance is enhanced while not practically reducing the area of the reflection surface. Further, as shown in Fig. 16, the sub-reflector 212 is attached to the reflector 152 with little gap therebetween, and a reflection surface is continuously formed. Accordingly, the exterior performance can be further enhanced. [0065]<br>
The light of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and can take various configurations without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
