				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention  relates  to  a  tracking  system   for monitoring and controlling the position of mobile units.<br>
Positioning information in today's world is of paramount significance and the information can be used in many different ways. The positioning information finds application in defence,industrial and transport sectors for effective depolyment of mobile units. Various technologies are used for getting positioning information based on the user needs. Defence and surveying applications require highly accurate position (cm level) information for deployment and asset management. Industrial and transport application require accuracy (1-5 meters) for effective resource utilisation and control of mobile units for trouble and congestion free operations. The system that monitors and controls the position of mobile units is known as vehicle tracking systems.<br>
A tracking system is an integrated system for positioning and control of the mobile units from a central station. Such a system finds use in various fields like police, fire department, transport companies, airport and open cast mines. Various technologies are used to implement such system to meet the user needs. The technology used varies from simple voice based communication dependent on the operator and supervisor to state of the art satellite communication to compute the position correctly and send them automatically to the central station.<br>
Typically in mines, vehicles play a critical role in transport of ore from shovels to crushers. The monitoring and control of vehicles is critical for the effective and safe operation of the vehicles in the mines.<br>
According to the invention, a tracking system for monitoring and controlling the position of mobile units comprising a graphical work station, a network modem to provide interface between the work station and the vehicle and broad cast differential corrections, differential global positioning system, DGPS receiver to said corrections and network modem and nirdeshak mounted on the vehicle to compute position information, transmit position and command type messages to the host.<br>
Presently in open cast mines dumpers and shovels are the mobile<br>
equipments that determine the productivity of the mines. The dumpers<br>
transport the ore from the shovel to the crusher bay and the shovels	<br>
excavate   and  load  the  dumpers.   The  dumpers   are<br>
capable  transporting  heavy  loads  per  trips.   So  a<br>
marginal      increase     in number  of   trips  per     day     results     in<br>
higher  revenues  and faster return on  investment.   In<br>
order to achieve effective utilisation of the mobile equipments, the open cast mining industry utilizes<br>
various technologies to deploy the vehicles.<br>
It  is  known to have an  operator  dependent<br>
system which uses voice communication between the central station supervisor and the mobile vehicles to<br>
know  the  position and deploy them  effectively.   This<br>
system depends heavily on the vehicle operator to report<br>
position and the supervisor routes the vehicles the operater having a<br>
mental  picture of the situation of the  various  mobile<br>
equipment's. Another form of operator dependent system uses data communication in the form messages from the<br>
operator to know the position. With thiÂ» system, the operator informs the central station of his position by<br>
sending location/destination messages to the central station. The central station collects the location<br>
messages  periodically from mobile equipment's  and  the<br>
central system based on the various location and status of the vehicles depalys them effectively. The disadvantage of this system is that it is to depend on the report of the operator in respect of the positon and the status of the mobile equipments. Further, they vehicle position is known only from few critical places as operator has difficulties in sending position information at regular intervals of 10 seconds. Further, the vehicle deployment programs do not work very well when the<br>
expected time of arrival of dumpers is not dynamically updated. The ETA based on distance and the average speed work fine under normal condition but during cogestion times the fail to work.<br>
It is also known to have an operator independent system in order to overcome the problems associated with earier system, an-operator independent system based beacons was developed. The system used radio based beacons placed at strategic location to report the vehicle position in the form of beacon to the central station. As the vehicle cross the beacons,<br>
The system in the vehicle gets the ID and transmits the ID to the central station. The central identifies the vehicle position from the ID. The system reported the vehicle position without operator help but the system is not real time, as this would require large number of bacons. Such large number of beacons create maintenance problems and when the mining area is changed, the beacons need to be redeployed leading to time consuming installation.<br>
The problem associated with beacon-based technology was overcome with the advent of Global Positioning system (GPS) based satellites. The system depends on satellites in space to compute position and the information can be sent at 10 seconds intervals to the central station.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A tracking system based on differential Global positioning system, DGPS<br>
is proposed to overcome the difficulties experienced with present system<br>
and also meet future requirements. The vehicle tracking system is an<br>
integrated system for vehicle positioning and control movement from	<br>
central  control station.  The vehicle  tracking  system<br>
(VTS)   uses  Differential  Global  Positioning   System<br>
(DGPS), a derivative of GPS for position determination. Global   Positioning   System  (GPS)   is   a<br>
constellation of 24 satellites orbiting the earth at  an altitude  of  20200 KM.  The  satellites  orbits  ensure<br>
visibility  of  4-6 satellites at all  times.   The  GPS receivers,  mounted on a vehicle compute their  position<br>
based  on  navigation  messages received  from  the GPS satellite   constellation.    The  GPS   receivers   use<br>
triangulation  method  to compute 3D  position such  as latitude,  longitude  and altitude using  4  satellites.<br>
The  position accuracy using standalone GPS receiver  is 100  meters.   The  accuracy is very  much  improved  by<br>
Differential GPS received (DGPS) which eliminates  major sources  of error by applying  differential  corrections<br>
transmitted from a reference DGPS receiver.<br>
The  traditional vehicle  navigation  systems<br>
are based on acquiring vehicle position by using onboard or   externally   installed  devices   like   Odometers,<br>
compasses,  gyroscopes, radio frequency  receivers  etc.<br>
The  method that employs these tools for the purpose  of vehicle  positioning is called Dead  Reckoning  Methods.<br>
In  Deed Reckoning Method, heading and distance  sensors are  used to measure the displacement vectors which  are<br>
then used in a recursive manner to determine the current position of the vehicle, with a known starting position.<br>
However,  accuracy  of  the  Dead  Reckoning Method  of constantly  degrading  since error  in  all measurements<br>
accumulatively  affect the current position  estimation. But  with the advent of DGPS position  estimation.   But<br>
with  the  advent  of DGPS  position  determination  now becomes  more accurate than that provided by  any  other<br>
system. OBJECTS. OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention  is  to<br>
propose an tracking system for vehicle positioning and<br>
control for the mobile units from central station.   The requirement of the system is to ensure the mobile  units<br>
can be monitored and effectively controlled to  optimise the  available  resources  and maximise  the  return  on<br>
investment.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to<br>
propose   a   system  which   provide   the   positional<br>
information  in user friendly way and in real time mode for  mobile  units  operating in  harsh  environment  of mines.<br>
Yet  another object is to propose  a  central control system, which uses alarms to indicate  deviation<br>
from  assigned  routes followed by  the  mobile units,  also<br>
information about the presence of unauthorized mobile units<br>
the     restricted     areas,   the  arrival   of     mobile units     at     the<br>
destinations and about the break down of mobile units<br>
According to this invention there is provided<br>
a  vehicle tracking system comprising a  graphical  work station,  a network modem to provide inter face  between<br>
the  work  station   and  the  vehicle  and  broad  cast differential  corrections,  a  DBFS  receiver  to   said<br>
corrections  to network modem and nirdeshak  mounted  on the  vehicle  to compute position  information  transmit<br>
position and command type messages to the host.<br>
In   accordance  with  this   invention   the<br>
reference D6PS receivers is located at a known, surveyed location.   This  reference DBFS receiver  computes  its<br>
position  from the visible 4-6 satellites, compares  the computed position with the known position and sends  the<br>
corrections  to  the  mobile BPS  receivers  over  Radio network.   The  mobile  receivers  apply  the   received<br>
corrections to the navigation messages received from the satellites      and      compute      the       accurate<br>
position.   Thus  by using Differential  GPS  receivers, position  data accurate to 2â5 meters can  be  obtained.<br>
The  position  data obtained using DGPS  receivers  from mobile  users  is  transmitted to  the  central  control<br>
station over Radio network.  Characteristic of the Radio network  will depend on the geographic terrain  and  the<br>
frequency chosen.<br>
At the central control station, the position  data<br>
from  the  mobile users is presented  graphically on  a Geographical  Map.   The central computer  displays  the<br>
vehicles in different colours based on the vehicle type, vehicle  speed  and  the  vehicle  status  for  ease  of<br>
identification.  The central computer will have position information,  the  speed, the Expected Time  of  Arrival<br>
(ETA)  and the Route of all the vehicles.   The central computer  uses alarms/events to indicate deviation  from<br>
assigned   routes   followed  by   the   vehicles,   the presence/entry   of   unauthorized   vehicles   in   the<br>
restricted  area,  the landmarks  crossed  en route,  the arrival   of  vehicles  at  the  destinations  and   the<br>
breaksdown of vehicles.  Zoom, Pan and multiple windows feature of the Geographical Map or a particular area  of<br>
the map is built in the VTS of the central computer  for monitoring of large fleet and wide area that is  typical<br>
of  a  city.  The application software  in  the  central computer   uses   point  and  click   operations   and<br>
alarms/events  for ease of operation and provides  query based interface to geographical information systems  and<br>
other databases.  The application software also supports configurable  command type messages for  communication<br>
with mobile users.<br>
