TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR ORAL USE COMPRISING ACID LABILE SUBSTANCES<br>
LUPIN LIMITED<br>
159, C.S.T. Road, Kalina, Santacruz (East)<br>
Mumbai - 400 098, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
an Indian Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing acid labile<br>
pharmaceutically active substances for oral use, a process for the manufacture of such<br>
compositions and a method of providing a gastric acid secretion inhibitory effect to a<br>
subject in need thereof, when using them.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Substituted benzimidazoles are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. These compounds are susceptible to degradation and/or transformation in both acid and neutral media. The acidic decomposition of these acid labile compounds is due to an acid catalyzed reaction described by G. Rackur et al., in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985: 128(1). P477-484. Therefore, such labile drugs need to be formulated in a way to stabilize the compositions.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,853,230 and 4,786,505 describe enteric-coated pharmaceutical formulations of acid labile substances for oral use, where the cores contain acid labile drugs mixed with alkaline reacting substances. These are coated with a first separating layer, which rapidly disintegrates in gastric fluid, and a final enteric layer.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,706 claims an oral pharmaceutical preparation of omeprazole or an alkali salt of omeprazole and a process for producing such preparation. The design principle of the preparation is basically similar to the U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,505. This preparation is comprised of: 1) a nucleus of active drug and first basic organic compound; 2) a first coating on nucleus containing at least a layer of a basic water soluble excipient and a second basic organic compound; and 3) a second coating formed by an enteric coating. The major difference between U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,232,706 and 4,786,505 is the type of basic compound used; the former uses basic organic compound the later uses inorganic alkaline reaction compounds in core and in subcoating.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,899 relates to a) a core containing a pharmacologically effective amount of a pharmacologically effective, acid-unstable benzimidazole compound, b) a slightly water-soluble first coating layer, coated on the core, comprising a slightly water-soluble, film-forming material selected from the group consisting of ethyl cellulose and polyvinyl acetate and fine particles of a slightly water-soluble substance selected from the group consisting of magnesium oxide, silicic anhydride, calcium silicate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate and sucrose fatty acid esters suspended in the first layer, and c) a second coating layer, coated on the first layer, of an enteric polymer film.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,739 relates to a stable formulation of Omeprazole microgranules containing a neutral core of sugar and starch coated with an active layer of drug and mannitol powder mixture with the aid of a solution of a binding agent in water plus ethanol. An additional protective layer of mannitol and sugar syrup is then applied prior to the final gastroprotection coating.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,700 teaches a method for stabilizing an acid unstable benzimidazole derivative, by forming an inclusion complex of omeprazole with cyclodextrin.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,560 discloses spherical granules having a seed core coated with a binder and spraying powder containing lansoprazole as active drug, low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose and magnesium or calcium carbonate as alkaline agents. The powder-coated core is further coated with spraying powder of low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose and then with enteric coating agent.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,321 describes a pharmaceutical composition for coated tablets or granules, which is comprised of lansoprazole being in contact with at least one of the basic inorganic salts evenly. No protective and/or enteric coating is mentioned in the patent claims.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,132 is similar to the U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,321 but more specifically, describes an oral stabilized pharmaceutical composition for the inhibition of gastric acid<br><br>
secretion comprising of lansoprazole or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in.contact evenly with a basic inorganic salt stabilizing agent.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,903 discloses an orally administrable medicament in pellet or tablet form which is resistant to gastric juice, and in which each pellet or tablet consists of a core in which active compound or its physiologically-tolerated salt is in admixture with binder, filler and, optionally, a member selected from the group consisting of another tablet auxiliary and a basic physiologically-tolerated inorganic compound, an inert water-soluble intermediate layer surrounding the core and an outer layer which is resistant to gastric juice, wherein the active compound is pantoprazole, the binder is polyvinylpyrrolidone and/or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and, optionally, the filler is mannitol.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,726,927 discloses a new stable enteric coated pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration containing omeprazole or Lansoprazole, to a formulation essentially consisting of: a) the core formulation by dry mixing, without using an aqueous granulating solution, the acid unstable drug with the alkaline substance; b) quantitatively filling the core formulation into the hard gelatin capsule shell to give a filled hard gelatin capsules shell, wherein the gelatin capsule shell has an outer surface and an inner surface; and c) coating the outer surface of the filled hiird gelatin capsule shell with the enteric coating solution or dispersion.<br>
WO 85/03436 discloses a pharmaceutical prepiiration in which the core contains active drugs mixed with buffering compounds such as sodium dihydrogenphosphate, which maintains a constant pH. A coating material is used to provide a constant rate of diffusion of the pharmaceutical active. However, this formulation is not suitable for acid labile compounds where a rapid release in the small intestine is required. The direct application of an enteric coating onto the pharmaceutical active would adversely influence the storage stability of the acid labile compounds contained therein.<br>
WO 03/077829 discloses a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for oral use with desired dissolution profile and stability comprises steps of manufacturing a) core containing a pharmacologically effective E.cid labile compound, and/or its alkaline salts, optionally with alkaline reacting substance b) an inert sub-coating layer which is a<br><br>
first coating layer, coated on the core, comprising film forming material such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, dextran and optionally water insoluble particles such as magnesium oxide, sililic anhydride, calcium silicate, magnesium hydroxide magnesium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, calcium stearate and magnesium stearate c) second coat, termed as a seal coat, comprising of a mixture of polymers like hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, and ethyl cellulose over the sub-coat d) an enteric coating layer surrounding the said seal coat layer, wherein the seal coat layer isolates the core and the sub coat layer from the enteric coating layer.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,281 discloses a water soluble separating layer comprising a water soluble salt of an enteric coating polymer is formed in situ between an alkaline reacting core material containing a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole, and an enteric coating. The alkaline reacting core may be prepared in different ways, such as by preparation of granules or tablets including the active substance and the alkaline reacting compound(s) or by application of a layer including the active substance and the alkaline reacting compounds to preformed seeds.<br>
WO 94/02140 describes an enteric pharmaceutical composition comprising a core containing an anti-ulcer agent, such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, an undercoating of one or two layers and an enteric coating, wherein the core and/or the undercoating comprises aluminium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate coprecipitate optionally in mixture with a buffer, or a mixture of one of the following with a buffer: aluminium glycinate, an amino acid, an acid salt of an amino acid and an alkali salt of an amino acid, as a stabilizer, the buffers used being capable of controlling the pH of the mixtures to 8-9.<br>
US 5,626,875 describes a stable oral pharmaceutical formulation containing a benzimidazole compound, which is labile in acid medium, e.g. omeprazole and lansoprazole, which is obtained by coating inert cores with a first layer containing the benzimidazole compound, a water-soluble inert polymer such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or hydroxypropyl cellulose, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients having a non-alkaline reaction, such as talc, followed by coating with a second layer comprising an inert water-soluble polymer such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or<br><br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, talc and a pigment such as titanium dioxide, and finally with a third enteric layer comprising a polymer which is resistant to gastric juice, such as copolymerized methacrylic acid/methyl methacrylate, a plasticizer such as triethyl citrate or the like, and talc. The layers are applied using aqueous solutions or dispersions.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,739 discloses a dry mixture of omeprazole, mannitol, sodium lauryl sulfate and carboxy methyl starch which is applied to neutral cores of sugar and starch by means of a binder solution of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in a mixture of water and ethanol, each application being followed by a drying step. Also protective layers of mannitol applied using the same aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose binder solution as above, saccharose syrup and an enteric coating of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate are provided.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,942 describes an omeprazole formulation containing T1O2 for stabilization. The stated purpose is to obtain a stable pharmaceutical formulation having a core containing omeprazole and a single coating, only. The TiO2 is added to the omeprazole containing core and optionally also to the enteric coating. The formulation is obtained by application of an aqueous suspension containing TiO2 and various auxiliary agents, such as binders, sedimentation retarding agents and pH correcting substances, as well as a decreasing amount of omeprazole to an initial core, so that the mixture to be applied by the end contains practically no omeprazole. After drying an enteric coating is applied.<br>
The formulation used in the test for stability includes a substantive amount of the alkaline substance, disodium hydrogen phosphate, being known as a stabilizer to omeprazole, in addition to the TiO2.<br>
As illustrated by the above listing of prior art, many suggestions have been made regarding the preparation of formulations containing omeprazole and other acid labile benzimidazoles for oral administration.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide yet another composition for stabilization of acid labile compound, wherein the intermediate layer is insoluble to prevent ready<br><br>
access of moisture to the core and in addition contains an alkaline reacting compound to provide as a buffering layer between the acidic enteric coating and the alkaline core. Another object of the present invention is a method of providing a gastric acid secretion inhibitory amount of acid-labile substance to a subject in need thereof.<br>
