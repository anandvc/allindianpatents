METHOD FOR TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MULTIPLE<br>
RECEPTION LEVELS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to wireless communication, and more specifically, to a<br>
method for transitioning between multiple reception levels to minimize power<br>
consumption of a user equipment and to enhance quality of service in a wireless com-<br>
munication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Third generation partnership project (3GPP) mobile communication systems based<br>
on a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) radio access technique are<br>
widely deployed all over the world. High speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) that<br>
can be defined as a first evolutionary stage of WCDMA provides 3GPP with highly<br>
competitive radio access technique in the mid-term future. However, since re-<br>
quirements and expectations of users and service providers are continuously increased<br>
and developments of competing radio access techniques are continuously in progress,<br>
new technical evolutions in 3GPP are required to secure competitiveness in the future.<br>
Decrease of cost per bit, increase in service availability, flexible use of frequency<br>
bands, simple architecture and open interface, low power consumption of a user<br>
equipment and the like are suggested as requirements of next generation com-<br>
munication systems.<br>
[3]	Paging is an activity of a network calling one or more user equipments for a certain<br>
purpose. In addition to a basic function of enabling the network to search for a user<br>
equipment, paging also has a function of enabling the user equipment to be waken up<br>
from a sleep mode. The user equipment is in the sleep mode in normal times. The user<br>
equipment wakes up only when a paging channel is arrived from the network and<br>
performs an action requested by the network.<br>
[4]	In the sleep mode, the user equipment should periodically wake up and confirm<br>
whether the paging channel is arrived. Waking up of the user equipment at periodic<br>
intervals, not at all times, is called discontinuous reception (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
DRX).<br>
[5]	Unlike a base station, the user equipment operates using a battery. If the battery of<br>
the user equipment is not continuously recharged, the running time of the user<br>
equipment is limited. To increase the running time, the user equipment should be<br>
designed so as to minimize power consumption when the user equipment does not<br>
actually transmit or receive data.<br><br>
[6]	There are various methods to save power consumption. A first method that conforms<br>
to the design criteria established due to the limited capacity of the battery of the user<br>
equipment is to minimize the time spent for the user equipment to confirm whether any<br>
data has been arrived at the user equipment. The time spent for the user equipment to<br>
monitor a channel that notifies arrival of data to the user equipment, such as a paging<br>
channel, is minimized. A second method is to transfer user data to the user equipment<br>
with a minimum delay time when there is the user data to be transferred from the<br>
network to the user equipment. The longer the time is taken from the point when the<br>
user data is created by the network to the point when the user data actually arrives at<br>
the user equipment, the more the quality of service felt by the user is degraded. The<br>
user data arrived at the network should be transferred to the user equipment as soon as<br>
possible in order to minimize the delay time. However, in order to reduce the delay<br>
time, the time spent for the user equipment to observe a paging channel t, such as a<br>
paging channel, should be increased.<br>
[7]	Although the first and second methods described above are indispensable conditions<br>
for optimally operating the user equipment, they are conditions contradict to each<br>
other.<br>
[8]	There is a need for a method for simultaneously satisfying both of the two conditions<br>
in the user equipment and the network.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[9]	It is an object of the invention to provide a method for enabling a user equipment to<br>
transition between multiple reception levels through explicit signaling, thereby<br>
minimizing power consumption of the user equipment and preventing degradation in<br>
quality of service.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[10]	In one aspect, there is provided a method for enabling a user equipment (UE) to<br>
transition between a non-discontinuous reception (Non-DRX) level and at least one<br>
discontinuous reception (DRX) level. The UE in a DRX level wakes up periodically to<br>
monitor a scheduling channel. The method includes receiving a DRX indicator in a<br>
Non-DRX level with continuously monitoring the scheduling channel and transitioning<br>
from the Non-DRX level to a DRX level indicated by the DRX indicator.<br>
[11]	In another aspect, there is provided a method for enabling a user equipment (UE) to<br>
transition between a plurality of reception levels. The method includes receiving<br>
transition information in a first reception level and transitioning from the first reception<br>
level to a second reception level based on the transition information.<br>
[12]	In still another aspect, there is provided a method for enabling a user equipment (UE)<br><br>
to transition between a plurality of reception levels. The method includes detecting a<br>
transition condition and transitioning from a first reception level to a second reception<br>
level when the transition condition is detected. The DRX level period of the first<br>
reception level is different from that of the second reception level.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[13]	A user equipment can transition between multiple DRX levels by an explicit<br>
command/signaling. Power consumption of the user equipment incurred by waiting<br>
when the user equipment transmits and/or receives data is minimized, and quality of<br>
service can be optimized.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[26]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a wireless communication system. It can be a<br>
network structure of an evolved-universal mobile telecommunication system<br>
(E-UMTS). The E-UMTS can be referred to as a long term evolution (LTE) system.<br>
The wireless communication system is widely deployed to provide a variety of com-<br>
munication services, such as voices, packet data, and the like.<br><br>
[27]	Referring to FIG. 1, an evolved-UMTS terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN)<br>
includes a base station (BS) 20. A user equipment (UE) 10 can be fixed or mobile and<br>
can be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station (MS), a user<br>
terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a wireless device or the like. The BS 20<br>
generally is a fixed station that communicates with the UE 10 and can be referred to as<br>
another terminology, such as an evolved-NodeB (eNB), a base transceiver system<br>
(BTS), an access point or the like. One or more cells can exist within the scope of the<br>
BS 20. An interface for transmitting user traffics or control traffics can be used<br>
between BSs 20. Hereinafter, a downlink means a communication from the BS 20 to<br>
the UE 10, and an uplink means a communication from the UE 10 and the BS 20.<br>
[28]	The BS 20 provides termination points of the user plane and the control plane. The<br>
BSs 20 are connected to each other through an X2 interface, and adjacent base stations<br>
20 can have a network of a meshed structure where the X2 interface always exists.<br>
[29]	The BS 20 is connected an evolved packet core (EPC), further specifically, to an<br>
access gateway (aGW) 30, through an S1 interface. The aGW 30 provides a<br>
termination point of a session and mobility management function of the user<br>
equipment 10. Between the BS 20 and the aGW 30, a plurality of nodes can be<br>
connected to each other in a many-to-many relation through the S1 interface. The aGW<br>
30 can be divided into a part for processing user traffics and a part for processing<br>
control traffics. In this case, an aGW for processing traffics of a new user can<br>
communicate with an aGW for processing control traffics through a new interface. The<br>
aGW 30 is also referred to as a mobility management entity / user plane entity<br>
(MME/UPE).<br>
[30]	Layers of the radio interface protocol between the UE and the BS can be divided into<br>
L1 (a first layer), L2 (a second layer) and L3 (a third layer) based on the lower three<br>
layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well-known to com-<br>
munication systems. A physical layer corresponding to the first layer provides an in-<br>
formation transfer service using a physical channel. A radio resource control (RCC)<br>
layer placed in the third layer controls radio resources between the UE and the<br>
network. For this purpose, the RRC layer exchanges RRC messages between the UE<br>
and the network. The RRC layer can be distributed among network nodes, such as the<br>
BS 20, the aGW 30 and the like, or can be located only in the BS 20 or the aGW 30.<br>
[31]	The radio interface protocol includes the physical layer, a data link layer and a<br>
network layer in the horizontal plane. Or the radio interface protocol includes a user<br>
plane for transmitting data information and a control plane for transferring control<br>
signals in the vertical plane.<br>
[32]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the control plane of the radio interface protocol.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the user plane of the radio interface protocol. These<br><br>
show the structure of the radio interface protocol between a UE and a E-UTRAN based<br>
on the 3GPP radio access network specification.<br>
[33]	Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, a physical layer, i.e., a first layer, provides an information<br>
transfer service to upper layers using a physical channel. The physical layer is<br>
connected to a medium access control (MAC) layer, i.e., an upper layer, through a<br>
transport channel. Data are moved between the MAC layer and the physical layer<br>
through the transport channel. Between different physical layers, i.e., the physical layer<br>
of a transmitter and the physical layer of a receiver, data are moved through the<br>
physical channel.<br>
[34]	The MAC layer of a second layer provides a service to a radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer, i.e., an upper layer, through a logical channel. The RLC layer of the second layer<br>
supports reliable data transfer. The function of the RLC layer can be implemented as a<br>
functional block within the MAC layer and in this case, the RLC layer may not exist as<br>
shown in dotted line.<br>
[35]	A packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) of the second layer performs header<br>
compression function to reduce the size of an IP(Internet Protocol) packet header<br>
containing relatively large and unnecessary control information in order to efficiently<br>
transmit packets in a radio section of a narrow bandwidth when transmitting IP packets<br>
such as IPv4 or IPv6 packets.<br>
[36]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer of a third layer is defined only on the control<br>
plane. The RRC layer controls the logical channel, the transport channel and the<br>
physical channel in relation with configuration, reconfiguration and release of a radio<br>
bearer (RB). The RB means a service provided by the second layer to transfer data<br>
between the UE and the E-UTRAN. The RB means a logical path provided by the first<br>
and second layers of the radio protocol to transfer data between the UE and the E-<br>
UTRAN. Generally, setting an RB means a process of specifying characteristics of the<br>
radio protocol layers and channels needed for providing a specific service and setting<br>
specific parameters and operating methods of the radio protocol layers and channels.<br>
[37]	A downlink transport channel for transmitting data from the network to the UE<br>
includes a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting system information and a<br>
downlink-shared channel (DL-SCH) for transmitting user traffics or control messages.<br>
Traffics for multicast or broadcast service or control messages can be transmitted<br>
through the DL-SCH or a separate downlink-multicast channel (DL-MCH). An uplink<br>
transport channel for transmitting data from the UE to the network includes a random<br>
access channel (RACH) for transmitting initial control messages and an uplink-shared<br>
channel (UL-SCH) for transmitting other user traffics or control messages. A paging<br>
channel (PCH) for transferring paging information is also included in the uplink<br>
transport channel.<br><br>
[38]	FIG. 4 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[39]	Referring to FIG. 4, a UE has at least two discontinuous reception (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as DRX) levels. The DRX level defines a moment for the UE to confirm<br>
arrival of downlink data. The DRX level is a reception level for reducing power<br>
consumption of the UE. The DRX level defines a period for confirming arrival of<br>
downlink data, i.e., a DRX level period. The UE confirms arrival of downlink data at<br>
every DRX level period. A time point in the DRX level period at which the UE<br>
confirms arrival of downlink data is called as a paging occasion. The paging occasion<br>
can be repeated in every DRX level period.<br>
[40]	An interval at which radio resources are allocated to the UE is called as a<br>
transmission time interval (TTI), and the paging occasion can point a first TTI in the<br>
DRX level period.<br>
[41]	The DRX level period of each DRX level can be different from those of other DRX<br>
levels. There is a plurality of DRX levels having DRX level periods different from<br>
each other.<br>
[42]	Hereinafter, it is assumed that the UE has two DRX levels, i.e., a first DRX level and<br>
a second DRX level, and the DRX level period of the first DRX level is longer than the<br>
DRX level period of the second DRX level. However, the number of DRX levels is not<br>
limited to two, but can be three or more.<br>
[43]	The UE wakes up at the first subframe of the first DRX level and receives a<br>
scheduling channel. Here, the scheduling channel means a channel that indicates<br>
arrival of data to the UE or transmits a paging signal to the UE. The scheduling<br>
channel may be a paging indicator channel (PICH), a paging channel (PCH), an L1/L2<br>
control channel and the like.<br>
[44]	In FIG. 4, since the UE cannot find its information from the first subframe of the first<br>
DRX level, it enters into a sleep mode during the remaining DRX level period.<br>
[45]	Next, the UE wakes up at the first subframe of the first DRX level period and<br>
receives the scheduling channel. If the BS has a first data D1 to transmit, the BS<br>
informs the UE of the existence of the first data in line with the starting point of the<br>
first DRX level period through the scheduling channel. The UE recognizes that it has<br>
been scheduled and operates in a non-discontinuous reception (Non-DRX) level. The<br>
Non-DRX level may also be called as a continuous reception level. In the Non-DRX<br>
level, the UE continuously receives a channel directing to receive data or a channel<br>
informing arrival of data to be transferred to the UE. If the BS has the first data D1 to<br>
transmit, the BS informs the UE of the existence of the first data through the<br>
scheduling channel. The UE recognizes the scheduling channel, enters into the Non-<br>
DRX level, and receives the first data D1 as indicated by scheduling information.<br><br>
[46]	After completing transmission of the first data D1, the BS transmits a DRX indicator<br>
to the UE to inform that the UE does not need to continuously receive the scheduling<br>
channel any more.<br>
[47]	The DRX indicator directs the UE to transition to a new reception level. The DRX<br>
indicator becomes a transition condition for transitioning the UE to the new reception<br>
level. The new reception level can be a new DRX level or a new Non-DRX level. The<br>
BS can direct the UE to transition from the Non-DRX level to the first or second DRX<br>
level through the DRX indicator. In the example of FIG. 4, the DRX indicator directs<br>
the UE to transition to the second DRX level and the UE transitions from the Non-<br>
DRX level to the second DRX level as indicated by the DRX indicator. If the second<br>
DRX level is not set, the UE can transition to the first DRX level.<br>
[48]	While operating in the second DRX level, the UE wakes up at the first subframe of<br>
each second DRX level period and receives the scheduling channel. If the BS has a<br>
second data D2 to transmit, the BS informs the UE of the existence of the second data<br>
D2 in line with the second DRX level period through the scheduling channel. The UE<br>
recognizes the scheduling channel, enters into the Non-DRX level and receives the<br>
second data D2. Since the second DRX level period is shorter than the first DRX level<br>
period, the BS can transmit the second data D2 at further short intervals.<br>
[49]	If the UE cannot find its information from the scheduling channel during the<br>
remaining period of the second DRX level period, the UE does not receive the<br>
scheduling channel in the remaining period. The UE wakes up at the first subframe of<br>
each second DRX level period and receives the scheduling channel. If it cannot find its<br>
information from the first subframe of the second DRX level period, the UE does not<br>
receive the scheduling channel during the remaining period of the second DRX level<br>
period of the corresponding second DRX level.<br>
[50]	If a certain condition is satisfied while operating in the second DRX level, the UE<br>
can transition to the first DRX level again. Here, it is shown in the figure that as soon<br>
as the second period of the first DRX level period is over at the BS, i.e., the third<br>
period of the first DRX level period starts, the UE stops operating in the second DRX<br>
level and transitions to the first DRX level.<br>
[51]	At least two or more reception levels are defined between the network and the UE.<br>
The reception level means a reception state of the UE, which can be a Non-DRX level<br>
or a DRX level. When a transition condition is satisfied, the UE can transition between<br>
the reception levels.<br>
[52]	The reception levels are transitioned by an explicit command or an explicit signaling.<br>
[53]	One example of the transition condition for transitioning between the reception levels<br>
is that the UE receives a DRX indicator. The DRX indicator can direct the UE to<br>
transition to another DRX level. Also the DRX indicator can direct the UE to transition<br><br>
to the Non-DRX level. The DRX indicator can contain information indicating to which<br>
reception level the UE should transition among a plurality of reception levels. If the<br>
UE receives the DRX indicator on whether the UE should transition to a specific DRX<br>
level, the UE transitions to the DRX level directed by the DRX indicator.<br>
[54]	The DRX indicator can contain information indicating when the UE transitions to a<br>
new DRX level. The DRX indicator can contain a start time of the new DRX level. If<br>
the DRX indicator contains information indicating when the UE should transition to<br>
the new DRX level, the UE can transition to the new DRX level at the time directed by<br>
the information.<br>
[55]	The DRX indicator can be transmitted through the L1/L2 control channel. Al-<br>
ternatively, the DRX indicator can be transmitted through a MAC message and the<br>
DRX indicator can be contained in the MAC header. The DRX indicator contained in<br>
the MAC header can be contained in the MAC protocol data unit (PDU) in the form of<br>
control information. The DRX indicator can be transmitted through an RRC message.<br>
[56]	Another example of the transition condition is that the UE receives a setting value of<br>
a new reception level. The BS can inform the UE of the setting value when the<br>
network and the UE initially establish a call or reestablish the call. The setting value<br>
can be a value related to a DRX level period used in each DRX level. Alternatively, the<br>
setting value can be information indicating when a DRX level period begins in each<br>
DRX level. The setting value can be transferred through an RRC message.<br>
[57]	Still another example of the transition condition is that the UE does not receive data<br>
for a specific period of time, or the UE is not notified for a specific period of time with<br>
arrival of data that the UE should receive through a channel directing the UE to receive<br>
data or a channel informing existence of data to be transferred to the UE.<br>
[58]	Still another example of the transition condition is that the UE transmits data through<br>
an uplink channel. This is a case where the UE transmits a message for requesting<br>
radio resources to the uplink channel or transmits user data or a control message<br>
through the uplink channel.<br>
[59]	Still another example of the transition condition is starting of a new DRX level<br>
period of a DRX level that is different from the DRX level in which the UE is<br>
currently stays.<br>
[60]	Still another example of the transition condition is starting of a new DRX level<br>
period of another DRX level having a DRX level period that is longer than the DRX<br>
level period of the DRX level in which the UE is currently stays.<br>
[61]	If a transition condition is occurred and the UE transitions to a new DRX level, the<br>
new DRX level can be applied from a specific time. The specific time can be a time<br>
point at which a new period of the new DRX level starts. When the UE transitions to<br>
the new DRX level, the UE can maintain the currently used DRX level until the new<br><br>
period of the new DRX level is started.<br>
[62]	In each DRX level, the UE receives a scheduling channel which directs the UE to<br>
receive data or informs existence of data to be transferred to the UE at predetermined<br>
time periods. After receiving the scheduling channel, if the UE is notified with<br>
existence of data arrived at the UE or receives information on radio resources that the<br>
UE should receive, the UE can transition to a new reception level. For example, the UE<br>
can transition to the Non-DRX level. If the BS notifies the UE that there is no data<br>
arrived at the UE or the UE is not notified with information on radio resources that the<br>
UE should receive, the UE does not receive the scheduling channel until the next pre-<br>
determined time period based on the DRX setting value.<br>
[63]	In each DRX level, the BS can transmit a DRX indicator directing to receive data or<br>
commanding to prepare to receive data only at predetermined time periods through the<br>
scheduling channel. After receiving the DRX indicator, the UE can transition to a new<br>
reception level. For example, the network and the UE can transition to the Non-DRX<br>
level. If the BS notifies the UE that there is no data arrived at the UE or does not notify<br>
the UE of information on radio resources that the UE should receive, the BS may not<br>
transmit the DRX indicator until the next predetermined time period based on the DRX<br>
setting value.<br>
[64]	The predetermined time period can be a paging occasion. The paging occasion<br>
repeats in every DRX level period. The paging occasion is the first TTI of the DRX<br>
level period.<br>
[65]	Hereinafter, a plurality of reception levels and transitions therebetween is described<br>
with examples.<br>
[66]	A network and a UE can set three reception levels. The three reception levels include<br>
a Non-DRX level and two DRX levels (a first DRX level and a second DRX level).<br>
The network and the UE transition from the current reception level to the next<br>
reception level if a certain condition is satisfied. Then, they set a method of receiving a<br>
downlink channel based on the setting value set to each of the reception levels.<br>
[67]	In the Non-DRX level, the UE continuously receives a scheduling channel directing<br>
the UE to receive data or informing existence of data to be transferred to the UE. In the<br>
Non-DRX level, the UE continuously receives the scheduling channel at every time<br>
period.<br>
[68]	In the first DRX level, the UE receives the scheduling channel at every paging<br>
occasion based on the DRX setting value (DRX level period). If existence of data to be<br>
transferred to the UE is indicated or information on allocation of radio resources that<br>
the UE should receive is received in the paging occasion, the UE can transition to the<br>
Non-DRX level.<br>
[69]	In the second DRX level, the UE receives a scheduling channel directing the UE to<br><br>
receive data at every paging occasion based on the DRX setting value. If existence of<br>
data to be transferred to the UE is indicated or information on allocation of radio<br>
resources that the UE should receive is received in the paging occasion, the UE can<br>
transition to the Non-DRX level. Alternatively, the UE can transition from the second<br>
DRX level to the first DRX level.<br>
[70]	In the second DRX level, the UE receives a scheduling channel directing the UE to<br>
receive data at every paging occasion based on the DRX setting value. If existence of<br>
data to be transferred to the UE is indicated or information on allocation of radio<br>
resources that the UE should receive is received in the paging occasion, the UE can<br>
perform continuous reception only for a corresponding period of the second DRX<br>
level. During the whole corresponding period, the UE can receive the scheduling<br>
channel.<br>
[71]	One example of the transition condition for the UE to transition from the Non-DRX<br>
level to the second DRX level is that the UE receives a DRX indicator directing to<br>
transition to the second DRX level from the BS. Another example is that the UE does<br>
not receive data from the BS for a certain period of time or does not receive scheduling<br>
information. Still another example is that the UE receives a setting value for a new<br>
Non-DRX level. Still another example is that while the UE does not receive data for a<br>
certain period of time or information on data scheduling of the UE from the BS, the<br>
UE arrives at the first subframe of the second DRX level period.<br>
[72]	One example of the transition condition for the UE to transition from the second<br>
DRX level to the first DRX level is that the UE does not receive data from the BS for a<br>
certain period of time or does not receive scheduling information. Another example is<br>
that the UE does not receive data from the BS or does not receive information on data<br>
scheduling for the UE. Still another example is that the UE arrives at the first subframe<br>
of the first DRX level period. Still another example is that the UE receives a DRX<br>
indicator directing to transition to the first DRX level from the BS. Still another<br>
example is that the UE receives a setting value for a new Non-DRX level.<br>
[73]	If the UE has a plurality of reception levels, power consumption of the UE can be<br>
adjusted depending on the amount of user data transmitted to the UE. In an example of<br>
normally visiting a web page in Internet browsing, after downloading a web page, a<br>
user does not move to the next page while viewing the screen for quite some time.<br>
Data of the web page are transmitted to the user all together. However, some of the<br>
data, e.g., a few pictures configuring the web page, are delayed when being transmitted<br>
to the user depending on situation. In this situation, the UE operates in the Non-DRX<br>
level when the screen is transmitted at a time, transitions to the second DRX level in<br>
which some of the data can be delayed in the next stage, and finally, transitions to the<br>
first DRX level in which data transmission is almost needless while the user views the<br><br>
web page. If the number of DRX levels of the UE is large, power consumption of the<br>
UE can be reduced by differentiating DRX levels in accordance with the flow of the<br>
user data. Furthermore, degradation in quality of service felt by the user also can be<br>
minimized.<br>
[74]	FIG. 5 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A timer is used to transition between reception<br>
levels.<br>
[75]	Referring to FIG. 5, a UE is initially in a first DRX level. If a BS has a first data D1<br>
to transmit, the BS informs the UE of the existence of the first data in line with a first<br>
DRX level period through a scheduling channel. The UE recognizes the scheduling<br>
channel, enters into a Non-DRX level, and receives the first data Dl.<br>
[76]	After transmission of the first data D1 is completed, a transition timer starts. If the<br>
UE does not receive its information through the scheduling channel until the transition<br>
timer expires, the UE can transition to another reception level. Here, when the<br>
transition timer expires, the UE transitions from the Non-DRX level to a second DRX<br>
level. The duration of the transition timer can be stored in a memory, can be informed<br>
to the UE by the BS or can be assigned by the UE and informed to the BS.<br>
[77]	FIG. 6 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A plurality of timers is used for transitioning<br>
between reception levels.<br>
[78]	Referring to FIG. 6, a UE is initially in a first DRX level. If a BS has a first data D1<br>
to transmit, the BS informs the UE of the existence of the first data in line with a first<br>
DRX level period through a scheduling channel. The UE recognizes the scheduling<br>
channel, enters into the Non-DRX level and receives the first data D1.<br>
[79]	After transmission of the first data D1 is completed, a first transition timer starts. If<br>
the UE does not receive its information through the scheduling channel until the first<br>
transition timer expires, the UE can transition to another reception level. Here, when<br>
the first transition timer expires, the UE transitions from the Non-DRX level to a<br>
second DRX level.<br>
[80]	When the UE transitions to the second DRX level, a second transition timer starts. If<br>
the UE does not receive its information through the scheduling channel until the<br>
second transition timer expires, the UE can transition to another reception level. Here,<br>
if the second transition timer expires, the UE transitions from the second DRX level to<br>
the first DRX level.<br>
[81]	FIG. 7 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A predetermined number of DRX level periods<br>
are processed for transitioning between reception levels.<br>
[82]	Referring to FIG. 7, a UE is initially in a first DRX level. If a BS has a first data D1<br><br>
to transmit, the BS informs the UE of the existence of the first data in line with the first<br>
DRX level period through a scheduling channel. The UE recognizes the scheduling<br>
channel, enters into a Non-DRX level and receives the first data D1.<br>
[83]	After transmission of the first data Dl is completed, the UE transitions to a second<br>
DRX level. The transition can be performed by a DRX indicator or a timer. If the UE<br>
does not receive its scheduling information for a predetermined number of second<br>
DRX level periods, the UE transitions to the first DRX level. Here, the UE transitions<br>
to the first DRX level after three second DRX level periods are elapsed.<br>
[84]	The number of DRX level periods can be a value that is previously known both the<br>
BS and the UE or can be informed to the UE by the BS or vice versa.<br>
[85]	FIG. 8 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a first DRX level is not syn-<br>
chronized with a second DRX level.<br>
[86]	Referring to FIG. 8, if a UE does not receive its scheduling information for a pre-<br>
determined number of second DRX level periods, it transitions to a first DRX level.<br>
Here, the UE transitions to the first DRX level after three second DRX level periods<br>
are elapsed. At this point, the UE transitions to the first DRX level immediately after<br>
the predetermined number of the second DRX level periods is elapsed.<br>
[87]	FIG. 9 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a first DRX level is syn-<br>
chronized with a second DRX level.<br>
[88]	Referring to FIG. 9, although a UE does not receive its scheduling information for a<br>
predetermined number of second DRX level periods, it continues to be in a second<br>
DRX level until a first DRX level is synchronized. It is assumed that the number of the<br>
second DRX level periods is set to three, and if the first DRX level is not synchronized<br>
even after three second DRX level periods are elapsed, the second DRX level is<br>
continued until a new first DRX level period is started. At this point, the set number of<br>
the second DRX level periods means a minimum number of repetitions.<br>
[89]	FIG. 10 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[90]	Referring to FIG. 10, a starting point of a DRX level period is previously determined.<br>
Accordingly, although a UE receives a DRX indicator after transmission of first data<br>
D1 is completed, it does not immediately stop receiving a scheduling channel but the<br>
UE maintains the Non-DRX level until next second DRX level period is arrived.<br>
Thereafter, the UE transitions to a second DRX level in line with the start of a second<br>
DRX level period. Although a BS transmits a DRX indicator directing transition to the<br>
second DRX level after transmitting the first data Dl, the UE transitions form a Non-<br>
DRX level to the second DRX level at a time point when the next second DRX level<br><br>
period is started.<br>
[91]	Next, while operating in the second DRX level, if the UE receives its information in<br>
the first period of the second DRX level period through the scheduling channel, it<br>
transitions to the Non-DRX level again.<br>
[92]	The network and the UE can previously know the starting point and/or the interval of<br>
a DRX level period. Or the network can transmit information on the starting point and/<br>
or the interval to the UE. If the starting point and/or the interval of a DRX level are set,<br>
when the UE transitions from one reception level to another reception level, it can be<br>
known that when the UE transitions to another reception level and from when the UE<br>
receives the first subframe of the new reception level. If a condition for transitioning<br>
the UE from a reception level to a new reception level is satisfied, the UE does not im-<br>
mediately transition to the new reception level, but transitions in line with the starting<br>
point of the newly set reception level. That is, the UE does not transition to the new<br>
reception level at any time, but the new reception level begins to be applied only to a<br>
predetermined time period based on the starting point and the interval of each<br>
reception level.<br>
[93]	The UE having received second data D2 transitions form the Non-DRX level to the<br>
first DRX level when a new first DRX level period starts. While staying in a reception<br>
level, the UE can transition from the reception level to a new DRX level if a new<br>
starting point of a DRX level different from the current reception level is arrived. For<br>
example, while the UE operates in the second DRX level and a certain condition is<br>
satisfied, if a new starting point of the first DRX level is arrived, the UE transitions to<br>
the first DRX level. Here, the certain condition can be that the UE does not receive its<br>
scheduling information for a certain period of time in the current reception level.<br>
[94]	If the starting point of each DRX level is previously set, although the UE does not<br>
separately receive an indicator, such as a DRX indicator, and the settings of the UE<br>
and the BS do not match to each other, the affect of the mismatch can be minimized.<br>
Although the UE misses the DRX indicator in a reception level, the UE wastes battery<br>
power as much as the first DRX level period in maximum. Therefore, it is ad-<br>
vantageous for the UE and the BS to previously know the starting point of a DRX level<br>
period. For this purpose, when a certain condition is satisfied and the UE transitions to<br>
a new DRX level, the UE does not immediately transition to the new DRX level, but<br>
only needs to transition in line with the starting point of the new DRX level period.<br>
[95]	For example, an operation described below is also possible.<br>
[96]	1) A BS sets a first DRX level period and a second DRX level period of a UE.<br>
[97]	2) In a first subframe of the first DRX level period, the UE examines a L1/L2 control<br>
channel to confirm whether data has been arrived at the UE.<br>
[98]	3) If data has been arrived at the UE, the UE<br><br>
[99]	(1) receives the data based on scheduling information, and<br>
[100] (2) continuously monitors the L1/L2 control channel until a DRX indicator is<br>
received, and if the BS informs existence of data through the L1/L2 control channel,<br>
receives the data based on scheduling information.<br>
[101] (3) If a DRX indicator is received, the UE<br>
[102] (1) starts to operate in a second DRX level until the next first DRX level period is<br>
arrived, and<br>
[103] (2) receives the first subframe of each second DRX level period while operating in the<br>
second DRX and examines the L1/L2 control channel to confirm whether data has<br>
been arrived at the UE.<br>
[104] (3) If it is confirmed that data has been arrived at the UE, the UE<br>
[105] i) receives the data based on scheduling information, and<br>
[106] ii) receives the L1/L2 control channel until there is no more data for the UE to<br>
receive.<br>
[107] (4) If the UE confirms that it is not scheduled any more through the L1/L2 control<br>
channel, the UE enters into a sleep mode until the first subframe of either of the second<br>
DRX level period or the first DRX level period, which arrives first, is arrived.<br>
[108] 4) If any data has not been arrived at the UE in the first subframe of the first DRX<br>
level period, the UE operates in a sleep mode until the first subframe of the next first<br>
DRX level period is arrived.<br>
[109]<br>
[110] While operating in a DRX level, if it is directed to receive data or notified with<br>
existence of data to receive, through a scheduling channel or the like, a UE transitions<br>
to a Non-DRX level. Thereafter, if the UE receives a DRX indicator, it transitions to a<br>
new reception level, e.g., a new DRX level. The UE can update a currently used DRX<br>
setting value with a newly received DRX setting value.<br>
[111] A BS can additionally inform that when the new DRX setting value starts to be<br>
applied. When the UE receives the new DRX setting value, the new setting value is<br>
used from a time point directed by the BS.<br>
[112] A Non-DRX level is, in other words, the same as a DRX level period of zero. Ac-<br>
cordingly, if a new DRX level period value of the UE is set to zero, the UE can operate<br>
in the Non-DRX level until a new DRX level period value is set.<br>
[113] FIG. 11 is an example showing a method of receiving data according to still another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[114] Referring to FIG. 11, there is a plurality of operation modes in a UE depending on<br>
the number and operation of reception levels. In 'OPTION 1' mode, the UE has a DRX<br>
level and a Non-DRX level without a sleep mode. In 'OPTION 2' mode, the UE has a<br>
DRX level and a Non-DRX level with a sleep mode. In 'OPTION 3' mode, the UE has<br><br>
two DRX levels and a Non-DRX level. Three operation modes are described here, but<br>
there may be more than two or four operation modes.<br>
[115] In the 'OPTION 1' mode, the UE wakes up at the second period of the first DRX<br>
level period. At the first subframe of the second period of the first DRX level period,<br>
the UE confirms existence of its data through scheduling information and enters into<br>
the Non-DRX level. The UE receives data during the entire second period of the first<br>
DRX level period where it has waken up. If its data is not in the first subframe of the<br>
third period of the first DRX level period, the UE transitions to the DRX level again.<br>
[116] In the 'OPTION 2' mode, the UE wakes up at the second period of the first DRX<br>
level period. At the first subframe of the second period of the first DRX level period,<br>
the UE confirms existence of its data through scheduling information and enters into<br>
the continuous reception level. While continuously receiving data after waking up, if<br>
the UE is not scheduled any more, it immediately transitions to the sleep mode. If its<br>
data is in the first subframe of the third period of the first DRX level period, the UE<br>
continuously receives data again. If its data is not in the first subframe of the third<br>
period of the first DRX level period, the UE transitions to the DRX level again.<br>
[117] In the 'OPTION 3' mode, the UE wakes up at the second period of the first DRX<br>
level period. At the first subframe of the second period of the first DRX level period,<br>
the UE confirms existence of its data through scheduling information and enters into<br>
the continuous reception level. While continuously receiving data after waking up, if<br>
the UE is not scheduled any more, it automatically transitions to the second DRX level.<br>
Next, the UE receives the first subframe of every second DRX level period until the<br>
next first DRX level period starts. If the UE is scheduled in the first subframe of the<br>
second DRX level period, it wakes up and continuously receives data during the entire<br>
second DRX level period. If its data is not in the first subframe of the third period of<br>
the first DRX level period, the UE transitions to the first DRX level again.<br>
[118] Hereinafter, a DRX method related to uplink transmission is described.<br>
[119] Generally, when a UE transmits data or a control message to a BS, a response<br>
message is immediately transmitted from the BS. At this point, it is advantageous to<br>
use a DRX level having short DRX level period or a Non-DRX level.<br>
[120] If the UE transmits data or a control message to the BS, the UE changes a reception<br>
level that is being used. A new reception level can be the Non-DRX level or a new<br>
DRX level. When the UE transitions to a new reception level after performing uplink<br>
transmission, the new reception level is previously determined when a call is es-<br>
tablished or reestablished. For example, after performing uplink transmission in the<br>
first DRX level, the UE can transition to the second DRX level. Alternatively, after<br>
performing uplink transmission in the first DRX level, the UE can transition to the<br>
Non-DRX level.<br><br>
[121] When the UE requests to allocate radio resources, it can transition to the Non-DRX<br>
level. For example, if the UE uses an RACH, it transitions to the Non-DRX level after<br>
transmitting a preamble. If radio resources for transmitting data or a control messag is<br>
allocated to the UE through the scheduling channel as a response to the RACH, the UE<br>
can transition to a second DRX level.<br>
[122] FIG. 12 is an example showing a method of transmitting data according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[123] Referring to FIG. 12, a UE is initially in a first DRX level. The UE transmits data<br>
DU to a BS. After transmitting data D1 to the uplink while operating in the first DRX<br>
level, the UE transitions to a second DRX level. Alternatively, the UE can transition to<br>
a Non-DRX level, not to the second DRX level, depending on setting. The time point<br>
when the UE transmits data to the uplink can be the same as the time point when the<br>
UE transitions to the second DRX level, or the former can precede the latter, or the<br>
latter can precede the former.<br>
[124] After transitioning to the second DRX level, the UE searches for the first subframe of<br>
every second DRX levels and confirms whether its data is transmitted from the BS.<br>
After transitioning to the second DRX level, if the UE does not receive any data from<br>
the downlink for a certain period of time or does not receive any information, through<br>
the scheduling channel, the UE transitions to the first DRX level again. If the UE<br>
endlessly operates in the second DRX level after transitioning to the second DRX level<br>
after the uplink transmission, it can cause a bad effect on the power consumption of the<br>
UE. The certain period of time is counted using a timer after the UE performs<br>
transmission, or the certain period of time may mean the number of the second DRX<br>
level periods in which the UE stays after performing transmission. The certain period<br>
of time of the UE can be set through a call establishment or call reestablishment.<br>
[125] While operating in the second DRX level, the UE can transition to the first DRX<br>
level again at the starting point of the first DRX level period. Alternatively, a DRX<br>
indicator can be used.<br>
[126] The steps of a method described in connection with the embodiments disclosed<br>
