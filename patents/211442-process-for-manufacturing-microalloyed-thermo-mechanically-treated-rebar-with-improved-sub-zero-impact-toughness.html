				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing of high strength<br>
weldable microalloyed TMT rebar with improved sub-zero impact toughness. TMT<br>
rebars have wide applications in the construction sector such as general concrete<br>
reinforcement in buildings, bridges and various other concrete structures and<br>
especially high rise buildings.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) rebars are extra high strength reinforcing<br>
bars which eliminate any form of cold twisting. Conventionally TMT rebars are<br>
manufactured by processes where the steel rebars receive a short, intensive<br>
cooling as they pass through a cooling system preferably a water cooling system<br>
after the last rolling stand. This reduction in temperature converts the surface<br>
region of the steel bar to a hardened structure. This phase of intensive cooling is<br>
followed by further cooling in atmosphere so that the temperature between the<br>
core which remains hot and the cooled surface region (rim) is equalized and the<br>
rim later gets tempered by the heat from the core. The resulting structure is a<br>
tempered martensite/bainite zone at the rim periphery and a fine grain<br>
ferrite/pearlite structure in the core. Due to the improved properties of high<br>
strength, combined with toughness and ductility, microalloyed TMT rebars are<br>
preferred for construction purposes over mild steel plain and CTD rebars.<br>
Traditionally high strength carbon-manganese TMT rebars which are widely used<br>
have carbon and manganese in the levels of 0.20 to 0.25% and 1.0 to 1.5%<br>
respectively. The levels of carbon and manganese can be reduced improving<br>
weldability and sub-zero impact toughness keeping the strength intact by<br>
employing microalloying technique. Earlier, in microalloyed TMT rebars, the<br>
previous investigator used niobium between 0.02 to 0.06% or vanadium between<br>
0.07 to 0.15%.<br>
Sub-zero impact toughness is impact toughness below zero degree centigrade<br>
and steel bars having high sub-zero impact toughness are desirable in colder<br>
climatic regions. The known microalloyed TMT rebars possess the required sub-<br>
zero impact toughness for such purposes at reasonably higher percent of niobium<br>
or vanadium.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a microalloyed<br>
TMT rebar which has high sub-zero impact toughness as well as high yield stress,<br>
ultimate tensile strength and ductility at lower cost by the use of low niobium or by<br>
use of phosphorus.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a microalloyed TMT rebar<br>
which possesses low impact transition temperature.<br>
The applicants have now found that microalloyed TMT rebar having substantially<br>
higher sub-zero impact toughness is achieved by suitably selecting the levels of<br>
microalloying elements in the steel which are different from the previous<br>
investigators.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for manufacturing of high<br>
strength microalloyed TMT rebar with improved sub-zero impact toughness<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing steel billet having a composition of 0.05 to 0.1 wt% carbon, 0.3 to<br>
0.5 wt% manganese, 0.05 to 0.2 wt% silicon, upto 0.035 wt% sulfur and<br>
atleast 0.008 wt% of microalloying elements comprising niobium, and<br>
phosphorus wherein the level of phosphorus is in the range of 0.08 to 0.1%<br>
when niobium is not present or upto 0.04 wt% when niobium is present in<br>
the range of 0.005 to 0.015 wt%, the balance being iron;<br>
(ii) heating said steel billet at a temperature between 1200 to 1250°C;<br>
(iii) rolling heated billet to rebar;<br>
(iv) short intensive cooling the rolled rebar;<br>
(v) further cooling in atmosphere .<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention the sub-zero impact toughness of micro-alloyed<br>
TMT rebars has been improved by selecting the level of micro-alloying elements<br>
specially that of phosphorus and niobium in the initial steel compositions. For<br>
phosphorus based TMT rebars where niobium is not present, the preferred level<br>
of phosphorus is selected between 0.08 to 0.1 wt%.<br>
For niobium based TMT rebars the niobium is preferably 0.01 wt% while the<br>
phosphorus content is kept low i.e. up to 0.04wt%.<br>
Preferred levels of other elements in the initial steel composition is 0.08wt%<br>
carbon, 0.4% manganese, 0.1% silicon and up to 0.03% sulfur.<br>
The process for manufacture of the improved TMT rebar comprises preparing<br>
ingots having the above-mentioned steel composition. The ingots are cast<br>
according to conventional methods such as in twin-hearth furnace with tap<br>
temperature preferably at 1620±10°C and using ladles. The cast ingots are<br>
thereafter soaked in a soaking pit at temperatures between 1280 to 1300°C for<br>
around 4-5 hours. The soaked steel is then rolled into billets, which is fed into a<br>
reheating furnace. In the reheating furnace the billets are heated at a temperature<br>
preferably between 1200 and 1250°C for a period of around two hours. The<br>
reheated billets are rolled to TMT rebars finishing at temperature between 980 to<br>
1020°C and at a rolling speed of between 4 to 10 m/sec.<br>
The next and most essential step in the process for manufacturing TMT rebars is<br>
the short and intensive cooling of the steel. The cooling is preferably carried out in<br>
THERMEX water cooling system into which the steel is fed after the last rolling<br>
mill stand. The equalization temperature at cooling bed is maintained between<br>
500 to 700°C. The water in the cooling system is preferably maintained between<br>
15 to 22 kg/cm2. This is followed by a further cooling in atmosphere so that the<br>
temperature between the core and the rim layer is equalized and the rim layer<br>
gets tempered by the heat from the core. The steel is then available as TMT<br>
rebars for application in construction industry.<br>
The process of the present invention results in TMT rebars having low carbon<br>
bainitic steel structure in the rim and acicular ferrite steel structure in the core.<br>
Various metallurgical and mechanical tests were performed to evaluate the<br>
properties of the TMT rebars manufactured by the process of the present<br>
invention and they were found to possess yield stress of at least 415 Mpa,<br>
ultimate tensile strength of at least 485 Mpa, elongation of 18 to 20%. The rebars<br>
have excellent bend and rebend properties. The rebar also has excellent Charpy<br>
impact toughness and weldability due to low carbon equivalent of around 0.2%.<br>
The present invention will now be demonstrated with respect to the following non-<br>
limiting examples:<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example - 1: Process for manufacturing of phosphorus based TMT rebars with<br>
improved sub-zero impact toughness.<br>
Steel having composition of 0.08 wt% carbon, 0.4 wt% manganese, 0.1 wt%<br>
silicon, 0.01 wt% sulfur and 0.09 wt% phosphorus with balance iron was cast into<br>
ingots using a twin hearth furnace. The ingots were then soaked in a soaking pit<br>
at a temperature of 1280°C for five hours. The soaked ingots were then rolled into<br>
100 x 100 mm billets. The billets were reheated in reheating furnace at a<br>
temperature 1250°C for two hours. The reheated steel was finish rolled at a<br>
temperature of 1000°C and at rolling speed of 8 m/sec to 32mm diameter rebar.<br>
The rolled steel was then passed through THERMEX water cooling system after<br>
the last rolling mill stand. The equalization temperature is maintained at about<br>
600°C with water pressure of 20kg/cm2. After the phase of intensive cooling the<br>
steel is further cooled in atmosphere so that the temperature between the core<br>
and the rim layer is equalized and the rim layer is tempered by the heat from the<br>
core.<br>
Example - 2: Process for manufacturing of niobium based TMT rebars with<br>
improved sub-zero impact toughness.<br>
Steel having composition of 0.08 wt% carbon, 0.4 wt% manganese, 0.1 wt%<br>
silicon, 0.01 wt% sulfur and upto 0.04 wt% phosphorus, 0.01 wt% niobium with<br>
balance iron was cast into ingots using twin hearth furnace. The ingots were then<br>
soaked in a soaking pit at a temperature of 1280°C for five hours. The soaked<br>
ingots were then rolled into 100 x 100 mm billets. The billets were reheated in<br>
reheating furnace at a temperature 1250°C for two hours. The reheated billets<br>
were finish rolled at a temperature of 1000°C and at rolling speed of 8 m/sec to<br>
32mm diameter TMT rebar. The rolled steel was then passed through THERMEX<br>
water cooling system after the last rolling mill stand. The equalization temperature<br>
is maintained at about 600°C with water pressure of 20kg/cm2. After the phase of<br>
intensive cooling the steel is further cooled in atmosphere so that the temperature<br>
between the core and the rim layer is equalized and the rim layer is tempered by<br>
the heat from the core.<br>
Several metallurgical and mechanical tests were performed and it was found that<br>
the phosphorus and the niobium based steels have yield stress of 450 Mpa,<br>
ultimate tensile strength of 510 Mpa, elongation of 18 to 20%, bend property of 3.d<br>
and rebend property of 4.d. The Charpy impact toughness was found to be 100J<br>
for the phosphorus based TMT steel and 135J for niobium based TMT steel at<br>
room temperature compared to 60J for conventional TMT rebars. It was also<br>
found that the rebars possess impact transition temperature of -42°C for<br>
phosphorus based steel and below -60°C for the niobium based steel compared<br>
to -10°C for conventional TMT rebars.<br>
The rebars were also found to possess excellent weldability due to their low<br>
carbon equivalent of 0.2%.<br>
