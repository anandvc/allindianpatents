Toothed chain Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a toothed chain, composed of plates which are connected to one another by means of connecting elements and have connecting apertures, wherein two outer guide plates, following these at least two pivoting plates of tooth-like profile for force-transmitting engagement on a toothed sprocket, and between said outer guide plates and pivoting plates at least one connecting plate, are arranged on each connecting element, the guide plates and the at least one connecting plate being in interference fit, and the at least two pivoting plates being pivotably arranged on the connecting element.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Toothed chains of said type, often also referred to as inverted toothed chains, are known and are used primarily in vehicle construction, where they serve as control chains. A chain of said type is known, for example, from DE 689 18 842 T2 or the associated European patent document EP 0 384 076 Bl, and reference is also made to US 6,485,385 and US 4,906,224. The individual plates are connected by means of a connecting pin or bolt. Said plates have in each case two connecting apertures through which the connecting bolt extends. Arranged at the outer sides are two guide plates which are seated in interference fit, and therefore so as to be non-pivotable, in the region of the outer ends of the connecting bolt. Said guide plates are followed by at least two pivoting plates which are pivotably held on the connecting bolt by means of a correspondingly configured clearance fit. At<br><br>
least one connecting plate is in turn situated between said pivoting plates, wherein said connecting plate, like the outer guide plates, is likewise arranged in interference fit, and therefore so as to be non-pivotable, on the connecting bolt. The guide plates and the at least one connecting plate are situated - in a side view - one behind the other, while the pivoting plates are arranged offset with respect to said plate packet. The design of an inverted toothed chain of said type is known per se and need not be described in any more detail.<br>
In the installed state, the toothed chain interacts with at least two sprockets, over which the toothed chain is guided arid to which are assigned corresponding drive devices or other devices. A transmission of force takes place to or from a sprocket by means of said toothed chain. For this purpose, those flanks of the pivoting plates which face towards a sprocket are of tooth-like profile, that is to say corresponding engagement teeth are formed on said pivoting plates, which engagement teeth mesh with corresponding teeth of the respective sprocket. In such toothed chains as are known for example from DE 689 18 842 T2, force is transmitted exclusively via said tooth faces.<br>
With the design described in the introduction of the toothed chains in question, the force-transmitting face is relatively narrow in the region of the teeth because, as described, only the pivoting plates are toothed. The? transmission of force takes place entirely via said faces, and therefore the entire load is distributed only over said faces, resulting in considerable loads and load peaks. This is disadvantageous in terms of the wear to the toothed chain and the sprockets, and also adversely affects the elongation of the chain which occurs over time.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention is based on the problem of specifying a toothed chain which permits a better load distribution during the transmission of force to the sprocket.<br>
To solve said problem, it is provided in a toothed chain of the type according to the invention that the at least one connecting plate also has a tooth-like profiling which permits force-transmitting engagement on the sprocket.<br>
In the toothed chain according to the invention, not only the pivoting plates but also the at least one connecting plate are of tooth-like profile, that is to say the transmission of force takes place not only via the pivoting plates but also via the connecting plate. This has the result that the entire tooth face which interacts with the tooth face of the opposite tooth on the sprocket is considerably larger than in the case of the toothed chains of the prior art as mentioned in the introduction, that is to say the entire load applied is advantageously distributed over a larger area.<br>
As a result of the fact that, in the toothed chain according to the invention, both the guide plates and also the at least one connecting plate are seated with interference fit and therefore so as to be non-pivotable on the connecting bolt and only the pivoting plates are mounted so as to be pivotable, any bending of the connecting bolt, as occurs in the case of toothed chains in which the central connecting plate is likewise mounted so as to be pivotable, is considerably restricted. This advantageously counteracts any deformation during loaded operation. In conjunction with the additional advantage according to the invention of the optimized load distribution as a result of the larger-area tooth face or force<br><br>
transmission face, this provides overall a toothed chain which has a considerably improved service life and is subject to significantly lower plastic or elastic deformation during operation than previously known toothed chains.<br>
According to the invention, the tooth profiling of the connecting plate should be such that common engagement on the sprocket together with the tooth profiling of the pivoting plates is provided at least when said two profilings both engage completely in the chain teeth. On account of the offset arrangement of the pivoting plates and the connecting plate relative to one another and the fact that the pivoting plates are pivoted relative to the connecting plate as they run onto the sprocket, the design of the teeth of the connecting plates should be selected such that, while taking into consideration said behaviour or positional change of the pivoting plates relative to the connecting plate, the teeth on the plates come into common contact with the sprocket tooth at as early at time as possible, ideally as soon as they run on to the sprocket, in order to provide the maximum contact area for the entire time for which force is transmitted. The respective plates engage on the sprocket only with their outer tooth flanks, not with the tooth space profiles. On account of the offset arrangement of the pivoting plates relative to the connecting plate, as they run on to the sprocket, first the flanks of the pivoting plates and then the flank of the connecting plate come into contact with the sprocket, and when both the pivoting plates and the connecting plate have run on and are in contact with the sprocket, the load is distributed between both the pivoting plates and the connecting plate. The optimum load distribution is therefore produced at the moment when - with regard to one chain element - both the pivoting plates and the connecting plate have run on.<br><br>
One advantageous refinement of the invention provides that the connecting apertures of the guide plates and of the at least one connecting plate have the same pitch and a diameter which is such that an interference fit is provided in conjunction with the connecting element, that is to say the bolt or pin, while the connecting apertures of the at least two pivoting plates have a relatively small pitch and a relatively large diameter. The connecting apertures of the guide plates and of the at least one connecting plate are therefore aligned with one another, and an interference fit is produced. The pitch of the connecting apertures of the at least two pivoting plates is slightly smaller in comparison. As a result, although said pivoting plates are pivotably retained on the connecting bolt with a clearance fit, the edges of the respective aperture however bear at one side against the connecting bolt as a result of the smaller pitch and the slightly larger diameter. That is to say that the connecting bolt has a slight play relative to the inner wall of the connecting aperture, but contact is provided at one point as a result of the relatively small pitch. That is to say that when a load is applied, the connecting bolt is also supported against the pivoting plates, thus likewise counteracting any load-related deformation.<br>
The plates in question are often produced by stamping. Here, small production-related truncation edges are formed in the tooth region and in the region of the connecting apertures, which truncation edges slightly reduce the; size of the tooth diameter at the tooth ends and therefore the size of the contact faces of the tooth flanks against the sprocket and the contact faces of the pivoting plates against the connecting bolt. The more pivoting plates and connecting plates are used, the greater the truncation-related reduction in area,<br><br>
for which reason one advantageous refinement of the invention provides that the width of the pivoting plates and of the connecting plate is increased in comparison with known toothed chains, where the width of said pivoting plates and connecting plate substantially corresponds to the width of the guide plates, for example to at least 1.5 times, in particular at least 2 times the width of the guide plates. Multi-plate chains in which in each case two or more pivoting plate pairs and one or more connecting plate pairs are used are known in the prior art, for example from DE 689 18 842 T2 as described previously. Each of the pivoting plates has the described edge truncations which add up as a result of the pairwise arrangement. Because, according to the invention, relatively wide plates are now used, there is the possibility of a partial reduction, that is to say it is possible to produce a chain with approximately identical properties by means of the chain design according to the invention, with significantly fewer parts being used, specifically only two pivoting plates and one connecting plate and two guide plates in the simplest case. The width of the respective plate should be selected such that substantially similar contact areas to those in known multi-part chains are generated in the region of the flanks and apertures. It is also possible to produce an extremely stable, low-mass and more compact chain which can be assembled in less time than a chain in question from the prior art. This is because the use of a plurality of pivoting plates is no longer necessary like before as a result of the integration of the connecting plate in the transmission of force. This of course does not preclude the use of a plurality of pivoting plate pairs and connecting plate pairs if a very wide chain is required. The advantages which can be obtained according to the invention over a correspondingly wide chain from the prior art are, however, still provided.<br><br>
In order to as far as possible counteract the problem of truncation edges, it is expedient if the at least two pivoting plates and the at least one connecting plate, which according to one embodiment of the invention is also of a different width from each of the pivoting plates, are produced by fine stamping, so that the possible edge truncations can be reduced to a minimum. Other production techniques can however also be used as long as sufficiently precise production is possible.<br>

Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows an inverted toothed chain 1 according to the invention composed of lateral guide plates 2 at the<br><br>
outsides, which guide plates 2 are followed in the exemplary embodiment shown by two pivoting plates 3, between which is arranged in turn one connecting plate 4. As can be gathered from the sectioned illustration in figure 2, the guide plates 2 and the connecting plate 4 substantially overlap one another, while the pivoting plates are positioned offset with respect thereto. The plates themselves have corresponding connecting apertures through which a connecting element 5 in the form of a connecting bolt or connecting pin extends, which connecting element 5 is relatively thick in order to improve wear resistance and to avoid bending. While the pitch and the diameter of the respective connecting apertures of the guide plates 2 and of the connecting plate 4 are selected such that said guide plates 2 and connecting plate 4 are seated with interference fit on the connecting element 5, and are therefore not pivotable, the diameter of the connecting apertures of the pivoting plates is selected to be slightly larger, so that said pivoting plates are held on the connecting element 5 with a clearance fit. The pitch is selected to be slightly smaller, so that the aperture inner wall bears at one point against the connecting element 5, as is explained in the following.<br>
Figure 3 shows, in an enlarged illustration, a section from the chain 1 according to the invention having the previously described elements. It is possible to see that the two pivoting plates 3 and the connecting plate 4 are considerably wider than the guide plates 2, preferably twice as wide, in order to provide the largest possible tooth contact face, as will be described in the following. The pivoting plates and the connecting plate preferably have different thicknesses and outer contours, so that the parts can be easily distinguished during assembly.<br>
Said tooth profiling,  which permits  a  large  tooth<br><br>
contact face, is illustrated in detail in figures 4 to 6. While omitting the front-side guide plate, figure 5 shows the pivoting plate 3 on which two teeth 6 are provided, as is conventional in such toothed chains. The connecting plate 4 is also shown, on which are also formed two teeth 7, these being covered by the teeth 6 of the pivoting plates.<br>
This toothing design leads - see the end view in figure 4 - to corresponding tooth contact faces 8 being provided on the respective tooth outer flanks by means of the teeth 6, 7. On account of the offset arrangement of the pivoting plates 3 relative to the connecting plate 4, said tooth contact faces come into the contact with the sprocket one after the other as they run onto the sprocket, for which reason only the tooth contact face 8 of the tooth 7 of the connecting plate 4 is shown in the sectioned view in figure 4, while of the pivoting plates 3, which are shown in section, it is possible to see those tooth inner flanks which do not come in contact with the sprocket. Once both the pivoting plates and the connecting plate 4 have run on, both tooth flanks of the teeth 6 and also those of the teeth 7, that is to say therefore both the pivoting plates 3 and the connecting plate 4, mesh with and are in force-transmitting engagement with a tooth of the sprocket. This results in significantly improved load distribution as a result of said load distribution taking place over a larger area.<br>
Figure 6 shows the contact points of the respective tooth outer flanks of the teeth 6 and 7 of the pivoting plates 3 and of the connecting plate 4. The chain moves in the direction of the arrow P. The connecting plate 4 shown furthest forward in the movement direction bears with the front tooth outer flank 12a of its tooth 7 against the respective tooth flank of the adjacent tooth 13 of the sprocket 14, that is to say the tooth<br><br>
outer flank 12a forms the tooth contact face 8 as described with regard to figure 4. The tooth flank 12b situated on the other tooth is not in contact with the sprocket 14 and has slight play. The tooth space 15 between the two teeth 7 is also not in contact with the sprocket, nor are the inner flanks of the teeth 7. As is apparent, said inner flanks are at a distance from said sprocket, as indicated by the spacing a. The force-transmitting contact is provided only by means of the tooth outer flank 12a. In the opposite movement direction, the tooth outer flank 12b would be in contact with the sprocket, and the tooth outer flank 12a would have slight play.<br>
The following pivoting plate 3 is also correspondingly in contact with the adjacent tooth flank of the sprocket 13 only by means of the front tooth outer flank 16a, which forms the tooth contact face in this movement direction, of the tooth 6. The tooth space 17 between the teeth 6 and the tooth inner faces are also not in contact with the sprocket here, as indicated by the spacing b, and it is also the case here that the tooth outer flank 16b has slight play and does not engage on the sprocket 14. In the opposite movement direction, however, the tooth flank 16b would be in contact with the sprocket and the tooth flank 16a would run free.<br>
The shape or contour of the teeth 6, 7 should preferably be selected taking into consideration the relative movement of the pivoting plates 3 with respect to the connecting plate 4 as they run on, and also the running of said plates on the sprocket. It should be ensured that the maximum contact area is provided at least when the relative movement of the plates with respect to one another has ended after said plates have run onto the sprocket. Figures 4 to 6 are only diagrammatic illustrations which do not show the real<br><br>
tooth shape of the individual teeth in precise detail.<br>
It can also be seen from figure 4 that the production-related truncation edges 9 generated at the edges of the teeth 6, 7 only reduce the entire area to an insignificant degree as a result of the relatively wide design of the plates, therefore providing an optimized, large force-transmission area as a result of the toothing according to the invention both of the pivoting plates 3 and also of the connecting plate 4.<br>
It can also be gathered from figure 5 that the through bores 10 of the pivoting plates 3 have a smaller spacing than the through bores 11 of the connecting plate 4 and of the guide plates 2, which through bores 11 are of such a diameter that an interference fit with the connecting bolt is provided, are identical in pitch and are aligned with one another in the installed situation. The diameter of the through bores 10 is relatively large, as can be clearly seen from figure 4, so that a clearance fit is generated with respect to the connecting element 5. The pitch spacing is reduced overall by the distance d. This has the result that, after assembly, the connecting element 5 bears against opposite sides of the respective connecting apertures 10 of the pivoting plates 3, thus producing a single-sided clearance fit and single-sided contact. This has the result that the connecting bolt is supported not only by means of the interference fit of the guide plates and the connecting plate, but also by means of the pivoting plates 3 as a result of the smaller pitch spacing, thus counteracting elongation during operation.<br>
It is pointed out at this stage that, instead of the embodiment shown in figure 2 with two pivoting plates and one connecting plate, it is also possible to use corresponding plate pairs for wide chains.<br><br>
Alternatively, there is also the possibility of providing for example three pivoting plates and two connecting plates or corresponding pairs in alternation, it of course also being the case here that the connecting plates are designed with teeth. The production is preferably carried out overall by means of a fine stamping method, but is not restricted to this as long as it is ensured both that the truncation edges are as small as possible and also that the faces which bear against one another are machined as smoothly as possible so as to avoid friction losses. The design according to the invention can be selected for any pitch values.<br><br>
