				<td>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SUPPLY OF CURRENT AND STATIC CAPACITANCE TO COMPRESSOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to device and method for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor. Background of the Related Art<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram showing a related art device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a related art device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor is provided with a utility power supply 1, a first relay 2 for being turned on/off in response to a control signal from the compressor, a reactor 3 for absorbing a reactive power from the utility power supplied through the utility power supply 1 according to the turning on/off operation of the first relay 2, and providing the utility power to a main winding Cl of a compressor motor 'M', a second relay 4 for monitoring a voltage on the reactor 3, a first contact 4a connected parallel to the third reactor 3 for being opened or closed by the second relay 4, an operating'capacitor 5 connected in parallel to the third reactor 3, a starting capacitor 6 connected in parallel with the operating capacitor 5, a third relay 7 for monitoring a voltage at starting, a second contact 7a fitted to a fore end of the second relay 4 for being opened or closed by the third relay, and a third contact 7b fitted to a rear end of the starting capacitor.<br>
The operation of the foregoing related art device will be explained.<br>
Upon application of the control signal from the compressor, the first relay 2 is turned on, to supply a power to the main winding C1 of the compressor motor 'M' through the third reactor 3. In this instance, the third reactor 3 removes a reactive power from the power to the main winding. On the other hand, the utility power is supplied to a supplementary winding of the<br><br>
compressor motor 'M' through the parallel circuit of the operating capacitor 5 and the starting capacitor 6 as the third contact 7b is closed. Referring to a region 8 in FIG. 1, at an initial starting of the compressor, since the compressor motor 'M' is not rotated, a voltage to the third relay 7 is too low to put the third relay 7 into action. And, if the compressor motor 'M' becomes to rotate at a revolution higher than a preset value as the voltage on the third relay 7 rises according to the rotation of the compressor motor 'M1 tb*5 third relay 7 comes into action, to close the second contact 7a and to open the third contact 7b. Since the second relay 4 comes into action as the second contact 7a is closed, the first contact 4a is closed to turn off the third reactor 3 and to open the third contact 7b, to isolate the starting capacitor from the circuit. That is, at the moment of starting, the third reactor 3 becomes to be connected to the compressor motor 'M' in series to limit an excessive current, and the starting capacitor 6 provides a greater capacitance to the supplementary winding C2 to improve starting characteristics of the compressor.<br>
However, the related art device for controlling supply of power to a compressor has the following disadvantages.<br>
First, there have been frequent troubles in the region 8 at which a starting capacitance is controlled.<br>
Second, the mechanical system of the device for supplying power to the compressor costs high.<br>
Third, the starting control by the voltage rise following rotation of the compressor motor 'M' can not define a starting current accurately and has a poor starting characteristic.<br>
Fourth, the generation of excessive current in starting of the compressor actuates the circuit breaker, gives bad influences to peripheral device of the compressor, and has inconvenience in restoring the compressor to an original state.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF TUB INVENTION<br>

An object of the present invention is to provide device and method for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor, which can prevent flow of excessive current to a main winding of the compressor.<br>
Other object of the present invention is to provide device and method for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor, which can supply a stable voltage to the compressor regardless of variation of an external utility voltage.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide device and method for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor, which can prevent internal contacts suffer from damage caused by sharp current concentration during starting and operation of the compressor.<br>

FIG. 3 illustrates a diagram showing a device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a utility power supply 21, a first controlling part 22 for controlling overall operation of the compressor, and providing a driving signal for the compressor 25 according to a user's selection, a first switch 23 for being switched in response to the turn on/off signal for the compressor for supplying the utility power or cutting off the supplying of the utility power to the compressor, a second controlling part 24 for providing a phase control signal and a switching control signal varied with a state of the utility power supply, and different before and after the starting, a current controlling part 27 for changing an internal circuit system in response to the switching controlling signal and controlling a phase of the current of the utility power in response to the phase control signal for limiting the current in supplying the current to the main winding 26 of the compressor 25 during starting and releasing the limiting of the current after the starting, and a static<br><br>
capacitance controlling part 29 for varying an internal circuit in response to the switching control<br>
signal and supplying a starting static capacitance and operative static capacitance from a current<br>
of the utility power to the supplementary winding 28 of the compressor 25 during starting, and<br>
supplying only the operative static capacitance   to the supplementary winding 28 of the<br>
compressor 25 after the starting in response to the control signal. The current controlling part<br>
27 supplies current to the main winding 26 in a direction the current is increased gradually<br>
between an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to the phase control<br>
signal and the switching control signal. And, the current controlling part 27 includes a second<br>
switch 31 for switching over an output side of the first switch 23 and the main winding 26 in<br>
response to the switching control signal, or turned off, and a phase controlling part 30(a triac in<br>
this embodiment) connected in parallel to the second switch 31 between an input and an output<br>
of the second switch 31 for controlling a phase of the utility power supplied to the main winding<br>
26 depending on switching on/off of the second switch 31. The static capacitance controlling<br>
part 29 includes a third switch 32 for switching over the supplementary winding 28 and the<br>
output of the first switch 23 opposite to the second switch 31 in response to the switching control<br>
signal, and a static capacitance generating part 35 connected between the third switch 32 and the<br>
supplementary winding 28 for generating a required static capacitance to the supplementary<br>
winding 28 depending on switching on/off of the third switch 32. For stabilization, the second<br>
switch 31 and the third switch 32 have an overlap time period in which both the second switch<br>
31 and the third switch are in operation.<br>
In the meantime, in response to the switching control signal, the second switch 31 connects the output side of the first switch 23 and the main winding 26 through the phase controlling part 35 in starting of the compressor 25, and directly after the starting of the<br><br>
compressor 25. The third switch 32 is switched in response to the switching control signal, to change an internal circuit such that the static capacitance generating part 35 has a great static capacitance in starting and a limited static capacitance after the starting. As explained, the triac 30 as the phase controlling part receives the phase control signal of the second controlling part 24 as a gate voltage thereof for controlling a phase of the utility power. In general, the gate voltage is in a pulse form, and has a great duty ratio when a voltage of the utility power is lower than a reference value and a small duty ratio when the voltage is higher than the reference. As shown in FIG. 3, the static capacitance generating part 35 includes a starting capacitor 33 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 32 and the supplementary winding 28, and operating capacitor 34 connected between an input contact point of the third switch 32 and the supplementary winding 28 in parallel to the starting capacitor 33. That is, the starting capacitor 33 and the operating capacitor 34 are connected in parallel to each other during starting for providing a starting torque capacitance by switching of the third switch 32, but only the operating capacitor 34 is used after the starting.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a detailed circuit of the device shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the transformer 37 obtains at least one voltage of desired sizes from the utility power supply 10. A voltage sensing part 36 senses a size of the voltage of the provided utility power and provides to the second controlling part 24. A frequency sensing part 38 senses a frequency of the voltage of the external utility power by using the voltage provided from the transformer, and provides to the second controlling part 24. The second controlling part 24 generates different control signals depending on the size and frequency of the voltage of the external utility power sensed through the voltage sensing part 36 and the frequency sensing part 38, and provides to the current controlling part 27 and the static capacitance controlling part 29.<br><br>
Eventually, during the compressor 25 is started, the starting supplementary winding 28 has the starting static capacitance and the operating static capacitance from the current of the received utility power provided thereto, while the main winding 26 has the limited current of the utility power is provided thereto. However, even if the size of the voltage of the utility power is changed, the current to the main winding 26 is constant owing to the second controlling part 24 and the current controlling part 27. During the compressor 25 is started and operated, the starting supplementary winding 28 only has the operating capacitance provided thereto, and the main winding 26 has unlimited current of the utility power provided thereto. When there is a change of the size of the voltage of the utility power the same with a case of starting, the second controlling part 24 provides the control signal, i.e., the phase control signal, to the triac 30 in the current controlling part 27, for varying the current to the main winding 26 with the voltage of the utility power. In FIG. 4, unexplained reference symbols Rl - RIO denote resistors, Cl - C6 denote capacitors, D1 - D6 denote diodes, Zl - Z2 denotes Zener diodes, and PT denotes a photo transistor which provides a driving voltage to the gate of the triac.<br>
The operation of the first embodiment device tor controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 3-6. FIG. 5 A illustrates a timing diagram of signals provided to the triac, the second switch, and the third switch in FIG. 4, FIG. 5B shows a comparison table for fixing a triac conduction time period, and FIG. 5C shows a comparison table for fixing a conduction time period of the third switch in FIG. 3.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply 21 (a utility voltage), the transformer 37 provides internal voltages required for the control device from the utility voltage. Then, the second controlling part(a microcomputer) 24 in the control device is initialized, such<br><br>
that, as shown in FIG. 5, the voltage sensing part 36 provides a voltage divided by resistors Rl<br>
and R2 to the second controlling part 24 for a time period Tl. The frequency sensing part 38<br>
receives and senses a frequency of the utility voltage, and provides to the second controlling part.<br>
The second controlling part 24 receives the divided voltage and the frequency and determines<br>
a state of the utility voltage. Then, the second controlling part 24 generates a phase control signal<br>
and a switching control signal for providing to the current controlling part 27 and the static<br>
capacitance controlling part 29 according to the determined state of the utility voltage. A starting<br>
time is determined, in which the utility power is provided to the starting capacitor 33 of the static<br>
capacitance controlling part 29, and the switching control signal is generated, and provided to<br>
the second switch 31 and the third switch 32. According to the switching control signal, the third<br>
switch 32 is turned on and the second switch 31 is turned off. And, the second controlling part<br>
24 provides the phase control signal for controlling the phase of the utility voltage supplied to<br>
the main winding 26. With the phase control signal, the phase controlling part(or triac) 30 is<br>
driven, and the voltage or current provided to the main winding 26 is varied. As explained, the<br>
phase control signal is a rectangular signal provided to the gate of the triac 30, a duty ratio thereof<br>
is fixed based on a voltage provided from the voltage sensing part 36, and an output time point<br>
thereof is fixed based on the frequency value provided from the frequency sensing part 38. The<br>
supplementary winding 28 of the compressor 25 is required to be provided with a great static<br>
capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating capacitor 34 and<br>
the starting capacitor 33 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 32, to<br>
provide a large capacitance to the supplementary winding 28 during starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only a capacitance from the operating capacitor 24 is provided to the supplementary winding 28 as the third switch 32 is turned off(or<br><br>
opened) during operation of the compressor 25. As explained, the phase control signal and the<br>
switching control signal for the compressor 25 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage.<br>
That is, if the utility voltage is lower than preset overvoltages, turn on time periods of the triac<br>
30 and the third switch 32 are fixed longer, to make the compressor started at a lower voltage.<br>
And, if the utility voltage is higher than preset overvoltages, turn on time periods of the triac 30<br>
and the third switch 32 are fixed shorter, for preventing flow of an excessive current to the<br>
supplementary winding 26. In FIGS. 5B and 5C, Vs denotes an AC voltage of the utility power<br>
supply 21, Vdl - Vd4 denote DC overvoltages preset at the second controlling part 24, LI - L4<br>
denote turn on time periods of the triac 30, and Rl - R4 are turn on time periods of the third<br>
switch 32. The phase control signal is started to be supplied to the triac 30 in response to a<br>
frequency signal sensed through the frequency sensing part 38. That is, starting from a time point<br>
a signal form the frequency sensing part 38 rises from 'O'V to '5V, a timer(not shown) in the<br>
second controlling part 24 is driven, and the triac 30 comes into operation in response to the<br>
phase control signal of a rectangular form fixed according to the state of the utility voltage. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5A, as the phase control signal, a fixed voltage of a limited size is provided to the<br>
gate of the triac 30 such that a fixed current of a limited size flows to the main winding 26 for<br>
a first time period T-a 1, a gradually rising voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 30 such that<br>
an increasing current flows to the main winding 26 for an a second time period T-a2, and a<br>
voltage of a normal size is provided to the gate of the triac 30 such that a normal current flows<br>
to the main winding 26 after the second time period T-a2. As explained, if the third switch 32<br>
is turned on and the triac 30 comes into operation, to start the compressor 25, the third switch 32<br>
is turned off to leave open after the time T2, to cut off the static capacitance supplied to the<br>
supplementary winding 28 through the starting capacitor 33. Accordingly, during operation of<br><br>
the compressor 25, the operating static capacitance is supplied to the supplementary winding 28 only through the operating capacitor 34. When a time period T3-T2 is passed after the third switch 32 is turned off, the second switch 31 is turned on, to lead the current of the utility power to the main winding 26 through the turned on second switch 31 instead of the triac 30. In this instance, for stable operation of the control device, the triac 30 is kept turned on for a time period T4 - T2 even after the third switch 32 is turned off and the second switch 31 is turned on. After a time point T4, the current is provided to the main winding 26 only through the turned on second switch 31. Accordingly, the current of this time is not the limited size in the starting, but a normal size of the utility voltage. On the other hand, if the first switch 23 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving control signal from the first controlling part 22, as a main controlling part shown in FIG. 3, the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 25 no more, to stop operation of the compressor 25.<br>
As explained, the first embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
The starting time and a size of the phase control signal are controlled according to a state of the utility voltage. And, the triac is used for controlling the phase, and a gate driving signal for the triac has a value gradually increased from a fixed voltage of a limited size during the starting. Accordingly, flow of an excessive current to the main winding can be prevented during starting of the compressor, to permit a significant improvement of starting characteristics of the compressor. And, as unnecessary power cut off to the compressor is prevented, affects to the peripheral devices can be prevented.<br>

capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present<br>

As shown in FIG. 5A, the current controlling part 54 shown in FIG. 5A supplies a current to the main winding 52 in a direction the current is increased gradually from an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to the switching control signal. In FIG. 6, the current controlling part 54 includes a second switch 46 for switching over an output side of the first switch 42 and the main winding 52 in response to the switching control signal, and a triac 45 as a phase controlling part connected in parallel to the second switch 42 between an<br><br>
input contact point and an output contact point thereof for controlling a phase of the current supplied to the main winding 52 depending on the switching on/off of the second switch 46. The static capacitance controlling part 55 includes a third switch 47 for switching on/off between the supplementary winding 53 and the output contact point of the first switch 42 opposite to the second switch 46 in response to the switching control signal, a static capacitance generating part 56 connected between the third switch 49 and the supplementary winding 53 for providing a static capacitance to the supplementary winding 53 required for starting and operating depending on switching on/off of the third switch 47, and a negative temperature coefficient resister 50 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 47 and the static capacitance generating part 56 for preventing a momentary surge current caused by discharge of the static capacitance generating part 56 to the third switch 47. The second switch 46 and the third switch 47 have an overlap time period in which both the second switch 46 and the third switch 47 are in operation. The negative temperature coefficient resister 50 is provided between the third switch 47 and the starting capacitor 48 for preventing the momentary surge current to the third switch 47 caused by discharge between the starting capacitor 48 and the operating capacitor 49 at an initial starting, thereby preventing melting down of the third switch 47.<br>
In FIG. 6, in response to the switching control signal, the second switch 46 connects the output contact point of the first switch 42 and the main winding 52 through the triac 45 in starting, and the second switch 46 connects the output contact point of the first switch 42 and the main winding 52 directly after the starting. The third switch 47 is switched in response to the switching control signal, such that the static capacitance generating part 56 has a great static capacitance in starting and a limited static capacitance after the starting. As explained, the triac is used for controlling a phase of the utility voltage. As shown in FIG. 6, the static capacitance<br><br>
generating part 56 includes an operation capacitor 49 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 47 and the supplementary winding 53 for providing a fixed static capacitance to the supplementary winding 53 in and after starting, and a start supporting capacitor 48 connected between the negative temperature coefficient resister 50 and the supplementary winding 53 in series and with the operation capacitor 49 in parallel for providing a starting static capacitance for boosting a starting torque in starting.<br>
The operation of the second embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply(a utility voltage), the second controlling part(a microcomputer) 44 in the control device is initialized, and monitors a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a size and frequency. The second controlling part 44 determines the state of the utility voltage with reference to the sensed voltage and frequency. Then, the second controlling part 44 generates a phase control signal and a switching control signal for providing to the current controlling part 54 and the static capacitance controlling part 55 according to the determined state of the utility voltage. That is, a starting time at which the utility power is provided to the starting capacitor 48 of the static capacitance controlling part 55 is determined, and the switching control signal is generated, and provided to the second switch 46 and the third switch 47. According to the switching control signal, the third switch 47 is turned on and the second switch 46 is turned off. And, the second controlling part 44 provides the phase control signal for controlling the phase of the utility voltage supplied to the main winding 52 of the compressor 51. With the phase control signal, the phase controlling part(or triac) 45 is driven, and the voltage (or current) provided to the main winding 52 is varied. As explained, the phase<br><br>
control signal is a rectangular signal provided to the gate of the triac 45, a duty ratio thereof is fixed based on a state of a sensed utility voltage, and an output time point thereof is fixed based on the frequency of the sensed utility voltage. The supplementary winding 53 of the compressor 51 is required to be provided with a great static capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating capacitor 49 and the starting capacitor 48 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 47, to provide a large static capacitance to the supplementary winding 53 during starting. The large static capacitance is the starting static capacitance and the operation static capacitance for the utility voltage.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operating capacitor 49 is provided to the supplementary winding 53 as the third switch 47 is turned off(or opened) during operation of the compressor 51. As explained, the phase control signal and the switching control signal for the compressor 51 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage(size and frequency). That is, if the utility voltage is lower than preset overvoltages, turn on time periods of the triac 45 and the third switch 47 are fixed longer, to make the compressor started well even at a lower voltage. And, if the utility voltage is higher than preset overvoltages, turn on time periods of the triac 45 and the third switch 47 are fixed shorter, for preventing flow of an excessive current to the supplementary winding 52. In the meantime, during a few seconds before the triac 45 is turned on, charges both in the operation capacitor 49 and in the starting capacitor 48 are liable to flow to the supplementary winding 53 in a surge current. In this instance, at the moment the third switch 47 is turned on for using the starting capacitor 48, the surge current may occur owing to a momentary discharge. However, the negative temperature coefficient resister 50 provided between the starting capacitor 48 and the operation capacitor 49 can prevent the melt down of the third switch 47 caused by the surge<br><br>
current.   That is, the negative temperature coefficient resistor 50 is involved in a decreased<br>
resistance when it is heated up according to its characteristics. A changed resistance permits to<br>
prevent the third switch 47 from being broken by the surge current. In the meantime, the phase<br>
control signal is started to be supplied to the triac 45 in response to a sensed frequency signal.<br>
That is, starting from a time point the frequency signal rises from 'O'V to '5V, a timer in the<br>
second controlling part 44 comes into operation, and the triac 30 comes into operation using the<br>
phase control signal of a rectangular form fixed according to the state of the utility voltage as a<br>
driving signal. That is, as the phase control signal of the triac 45, a fixed voltage of a limited size<br>
is provided to the gate of the triac 45 such that a fixed current of a limited size flows to the main<br>
winding 52 during an initial period of starting, a gradually rising voltage is provided to the gate<br>
of the triac 45 such that a gradually increasing current flows to the main winding 52 during a<br>
middle period of starting, and a voltage of a normal size is provided to the gate of the triac 45<br>
such that a normal current of the utility voltage flows to the main winding 52 during a final<br>
period of starting. As explained, if the third switch 47 is turned on and the triac 45 comes into<br>
operation, to make the compressor 25 started, the third switch 47 is turned off to leave open after<br>
a preset time period, to cut off the current supplied to the supplementary winding 53 through the<br>
starting capacitor 48. Accordingly, during operation of the compressor 51, only the operating<br>
static capacitance is supplied to the supplementary winding 53 through the operating capacitor<br>
49. When a preset time period is passed after the third switch 47 is turned off, the second switch<br>
46	is turned on, to lead the current of the utility voltage to the main winding 52 through the<br>
turned on second switch 46 instead of the triac 45. In this instance, for stable operation of the<br>
control device, the triac 45 is kept turned on for a preset time period even after the third switch<br>
47	is turned off and the second switch 46 is turned on. After a preset time point, the current is<br><br>
provided to the main winding 52 only through the turned on second switch 46. Accordingly, the current of this time has not a limited size in the starting, but a normal size of the utility voltage. On the other hand, if the first switch 42 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving turn off signal from the first controlling part 41, as a main controlling part shown in FIG. 6, the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 51 no more, to stop operation of the compressor 51. As explained, the negative temperature coefficient resister 50 prevents the charge in the operation supporting capacitor 49 from surging into the third switch 47 when the charge is discharged toward the starting capacitor 48 at turning on the third switch 47.<br>
As explained, the second embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
The negative temperature coefficient resister is provided between the starting capacitor and the operation capacitor, which is involved in a decreased resistance when it is heated. Accordingly, in an initial starting, occurrence of the surge current between the starting capacitor and the operation supporting capacitor is prevented at the moment the triac is turned on, thereby preventing melt down of closely disposed contact points in the switches, or breakage of the starting capacitor.<br>

in supplying the current to the main winding 71 of the compressor 70 during starting and<br>
releasing the limiting of the current after the starting depending on an operation state of the<br>
second switch 65, and a static capacitance controlling part 67 having a first input terminal<br>
connected to an output contact point of the first switch 62, a second input terminal connected to<br>
a second output contact point of the second switch 65, and an output terminal connected to the<br>
supplementary winding 72 for supplying a starting static capacitance and operative static<br>
capacitance from a current of the utility power during starting, and only the operative static<br>
capacitance to the starting supplementary winding 72 after the starting depending on an operation<br>
state of the second switch 65. As shown in FIG. 7, the current controlling part 66 supplies a<br>
current to the main winding 71 in a direction the current is increased gradually between an<br>
interval from an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to the switching<br>
control signal. And, the current controlling part 66 includes a phase controlling part having an<br><br>
input terminal connected to an input contact point of the second switch 65 and an output terminal connected to the first output contact point of the second switch 65 in parallel so as to change an internal circuit thereof depending on an operation state of the second switch 65 for controlling a phase of the current of the utility voltage supplied to the main winding 71. The phase controlling part in this third embodiment is a triac. The static capacitance controlling part 67 includes a static capacitance generating part having the first input terminal connected to the input contact point of the second switch 65, the second input terminal connected to the second output contact point of the second switch 65, and the output terminal connected to the supplementary winding 72, so as to change an internal circuit thereof depending on an operation state of the second switch 65 for supplying an appropriate static capacitance to the supplementary winding 72. In this embodiment, the static capacitance generating part includes an operation capacitor 68 connected between the output contact point of the first switch 62 and the supplementary winding 72 for supplying a fixed size of operation static capacitance to the supplementary winding 72 in and after starting, and a starting capacitor 69 connected between the supplementary winding 72 and the second output contact point of the second switch 65 for providing a starting static capacitance to the supplementary winding 72 for boosting a starting torque in starting. The second switch 65 connects the input contact point to the second output contact point in response to the switching control signal in starting, and the input contact point of the first output contact point in response to the switching control signal after the starting.<br>
The operation of the third embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply(a utility voltage), the second controlling part(a microcomputer) 64 in the control device is initialized, and monitors a state of<br><br>
the utility voltage, i.e., a size and frequency. The second controlling part 64 determines the state<br>
of the utility voltage with reference to the sensed voltage and frequency.  Then, the second<br>
controlling part 64 generates a phase control signal and a switching control signal for providing<br>
to the triac 66, the first current controlling part, and the second switch 65 according to the<br>
determined state of the utility voltage.  That is, a starting time at which the utility power is<br>
provided to the starting capacitor 69 of the static capacitance generating part 67 is determined,<br>
and the switching control signal is generated, and provided to the second switch 65. According<br>
to the switching control signal, an input contact point of the second switch 65 is connected to the<br>
second output contact point for the static capacitance generating part 67.  And, the second<br>
controlling part 64 provides the phase control signal for controlling the phase of the utility<br>
voltage supplied to the main winding 71 of the compressor 70 motor. With the phase control<br>
signal, the triac 66, the phase controlling part, is driven, and the current provided to the main<br>
winding 71 is varied. As explained, the phase control signal is a rectangular signal provided to<br>
the gate of the triac 66, a duty ratio thereof is fixed based on a state of a sensed utility voltage,<br>
and an output time point thereof is fixed based on the frequency of the sensed utility voltage. The<br>
supplementary winding 72 of the compressor 70 is required to be provided with a great static<br>
capacitance for improving starting characteristics of the compressor 70.   Accordingly, the<br>
operating capacitor 68 and the starting capacitor 69 are connected in parallel by the operation of<br>
the second switch 65, to form a starting static capacitance and a operating static capacitance<br>
respectively, to provide a large static capacitance to the supplementary winding 72 during<br>
starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operating capacitor 68 is provided to the supplementary winding 72 as the input contact point of<br><br>
the second switch 65 is connected to the first output contact point during operation of the<br>
compressor 51 in response to the switching control signal from the second controlling part 64.<br>
As explained, the phase control signal and the switching control signal for the compressor 70 are<br>
dependent on the state of the external utility voltage(size and frequency). That is, if the utility<br>
voltage is lower than reference voltages, not only turn on time periods of the triac 66, but also a<br>
time period of contact between the input contact point of the second switch 65 and the second<br>
output contact point are fixed longer, to make the compressor 70 started well even at a lower<br>
voltage. And, if the utility voltage is higher than the reference voltages, not only turn on time<br>
periods of the triac 66, but also a contact time period between the input contact point of the<br>
second switch 65 and the first output contact point are fixed shorter, for preventing flow of an<br>
excessive current to the main winding 71. In the meantime, because the input contact point of<br>
the second switch 65 is in contact with the second output contact point of the static capacitance<br>
generating part 67 at an initial starting of the compressor 70, the current from the output contact<br>
point of the firsf switch 62 is divided to the starting capacitor 69 and the operation capacitor 68,<br>
to prevent the charge in the operation capacitor 68 from flowing toward the starting capacitor 69<br>
as a surge current, that in turn prevents melt down of the second switch 65. In the meantime, the<br>
phase control signal from the second controlling part 64 is started to be supplied to the triac 66<br>
in response to a sensed frequency signal. That is, starting from a time point the frequency signal<br>
rises from 'O'V to '5V, a timer in the second controlling part 64 comes into operation, and the<br>
triac 66 comes into operation by using the phase control signal of a rectangular form fixed<br>
according to the state of the utility voltage as a driving signal. That is, as the phase control signal<br>
of the triac 66, a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a fixed current of<br>
a first limited size flows to the main winding 71 during an initial period of starting, a gradually<br><br>
rising voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a current gradually increasing from a first size to a second size flows to the main winding 71 during a middle period of starting, and a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a current of a second size flows to the main winding 71 continuously during a final period of starting. In the meantime, if the input contact point of the second switch 65 is connected to the first contact point, the current of the utility voltage flows to the main winding 71 through the first output contact point of the second switch 65 instead of the triac 66. In this instance, for stable operation of the control device, the triac 66 is kept turned on for a preset time period even after the input contact point of the second switch 65 is shifted from the second output contact point to the first output contact point. After the preset time point is passed, the current is only provided to the main winding 71 through the turned on first output contact point of the second switch 65. Accordingly, the current of this time has not a limited size in the starting, but a normal size of the utility voltage. On the other hand, if the first switch 62 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving turn off signal from the first controlling part 61, as a main controlling part shown in FIG. 7, the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 70 no more, to stop operation of the compressor 70.<br>
As explained, the third embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
The division of a current to the starting capacitor and the operation capacitor owing to the second switch prevents flow of a surge current toward the second switch, thereby preventing melt down of the contact points of the second switch or breakage of the starting capacitor. And, the use of only one switch in comparison to the first and second embodiments permits the circuit to be simple.<br>
FOURTH EMBODIMENT<br><br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a diagram showing a device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to<br>
a compressor in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
a first controlling part 81 for controlling overall operation of the compressor 93, and providing<br>
a driving turn on/off signal for the compressor 93 according to a user's selection, a first switch<br>
82 for supplying the utility voltage received from a utility power supply 83 or cutting off the<br>
supplying of the utility power to the compressor 93 in response to the driving turn on/off signal,<br>
a temperature sensing part 85 for sensing an external temperature and providing the external<br>
temperature, a second controlling part 84 connected to an output contact point of the first switch<br>
82 for sensing a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a size and a frequency thereof, and providing a<br>
phase control signal according to the sensed voltage value, the frequency value, and the external<br>
temperature value, and a switching control signal different before and after the starting, a current<br>
controlling part 86 for limiting the current of the utility power in supplying the current to the<br>
main winding 94 of the compressor 93 during starting and releasing the limiting of the current<br>
after the starting in response to the switching control signal, and a static capacitance controlling<br>
part 87 for supplying a starting static capacitance and operative static capacitance from a current<br>
of the utility voltage to the supplementary winding 95 of the compressor 93 during starting, and<br>
supplying only the operative static capacitance to the supplementary winding 95 of the<br>
compressor 93 after the starting in response to the switching control signal. In FIG. 8, the current<br>
controlling part 86 supplies a current to the main winding 94 in a direction the current is<br>
increased gradually between an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to<br><br>
the switching control signal. And, the current controlling part 86 includes a second switch 89 for switching over an output contact point of the first switch 82 and the main winding 94 in response to the switching control signal, and a phase controlling part 88 connected in parallel to the second switch 89 between an input contact point and an output contact point of the second switch 89 for controlling a phase of the current supplied to the main winding 94 depending on switching of the second switch 89. The static capacitance controlling part 87 includes a third switch 91 for switching over the supplementary winding 95 and the output contact point of the first switch 82 opposite to the second switch 89 in response to the switching control signal, and a static capacitance generating part 96 connected between the third switch 91 and the supplementary winding 95 for providing a static capacitance to the supplementary winding 95 required for starting and a time after starting depending on a switching state of the third switch 91.<br>
In the meantime, in response to the switching control signal, the second switch 89 connects the output contact point of the first switch 82 and the main winding 94 through the phase controlling part 88 in starting, and connects the output contact point of the first switch 82 and the main winding 94 directly after the starting. The third switch 91 is switched in response to the switching control signal, such that the static capacitance generating part generates a starting static capacitance and an operation static capacitance of the current of the utility voltage in starting and only the operation static capacitance after the starting. As shown in FIG. 8, the phase controlling part 88 is a triac and will be called as the triac 88 hereafter. The static capacitance generating part 96 includes a starting capacitor 90 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 91 and the supplementary winding 95, and operation capacitor 92 connected between an input contact point of the third switch 91 and the supplementary winding 95 and in parallel to the starting capacitor 90.<br><br>
The operation of the fourth embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply 83(a utility voltage), the second<br>
controlling part(a microcomputer) 84 in the control device is initialized, and determines a state<br>
of the utility voltage, i.e., a voltage and a frequency thereof. And, the temperature sensing part<br>
85 senses an external temperature of the compressor 93, and provides to the second controlling<br>
part 84. Then, the second controlling part 84 generates a phase control signal and a switching<br>
control signal for providing to the current controlling part 86 and the static capacitance<br>
controlling part 87 according to the determined state of the utility voltage and the external<br>
temperature. A starting time is determined, at which the utility power is provided to the starting<br>
capacitor 90 of the static capacitance controlling part 87, and the switching control signal is<br>
generated, and provided to the second switch 89 and the third switch 91. According to the<br>
switching control signal, the third switch 91 is turned on and the second switch 89 is turned off.<br>
That is, the second switch 89 and the third switch 91 are operative oppositely in response to the<br>
switching control signal. And, for controlling the phase of the current of the utility voltage<br>
supplied to the main winding 94 of the compressor 93, the second controlling part 84 provides<br>
the phase control signal, which may vary with the temperature value received from the<br>
temperature sensing part 85.   That is, the second controlling part 84 compares the external<br>
temperature measured presently and a preset reference temperature, to find a season pertinent to<br>
the present external temperature and provide phase control signals consistent to the season. The<br>
phase control signal is provided to a gate of the triac 88 in forms of pulses. For example, in a<br>
case the external temperature is higher than Tl set as a reference temperature for summer, a pulse<br>
width of the phase control signal provided to the triac 88 is set to P3 of summer, in a case the<br><br>
external temperature is below T3 set as a reference temperature for winter, a pulse width of the phase control signal is set to PI of winter, and, if the external temperature is T2 between Tl and T3 set as a reference temperature for spring and fall, a pulse width of the phase control signal is set to P2 of spring and fall. For reference, in starting the compressor 93, the pulse width of the phase control signal is required to be large if the external temperature is low because the low external temperature leads a viscosity of the refrigerant poor to restrict a compressor motor substantially. Therefore, P1 has the largest pulse width, P2 has a next large pulse width, and P3 has the smallest pulse width. According to the phase control signal set with respective to a season, the triac 88 is driven, and a current provided to the main winding 94 is varied. As explained, the phase control signal is a rectangular signal provided to the gate of the triac 88, a duty ratio thereof is fixed, not only based on the external temperature, but also based on a size of the utility voltage sensed already, and an output time point thereof is fixed based on the frequency value of the utility voltage. The supplementary winding 95 of the compressor 93 is required to be 'provided with a great static capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating capacitor 92 and the starting capacitor 90 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 91, to provide the starting static capacitance and the operation static capacitance to the supplementary winding 95 during starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operating capacitor 92 is provided to the supplementary winding 95 as the third switch 91 is turned off(or opened) during operation of the compressor 95. As explained, the phase control signal and the switching control signal for the compressor 95 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage. That is, if the utility voltage is lower than reference voltages, turn on time periods of the triac 88 and the third switch 91 are set longer, to make the compressor 93 started well even<br><br>
at a lower voltage. Opposite to this, if the utility voltage is higher than the reference voltages,<br>
turn on time periods of the triac 88 and the third switch 91 are set shorter, for preventing flow of<br>
an excessive current to the main winding 94. For preventing flow of an excessive current to the<br>
main winding 94 in starting the compressor 93, as the phase control signal provided to the triac<br>
88, a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 88 such that a fixed current of a first limited<br>
size flows to the main winding 94 during an initial period of starting, a gradually rising voltage<br>
is provided to the gate of the triac 88 such that a current gradually increasing from a first size to<br>
a second size flows to the main winding 94 during a middle period of starting, and a fixed voltage<br>
is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a current of a second size flows to the main<br>
winding 94 continuously during a final period of starting. As explained, if the third switch 91<br>
is turned on and the triac 88 comes into operation, to start the compressor 93, the third switch 91<br>
is turned off to leave open, to cut off the static capacitance supplied to the supplementary winding<br>
95 through the starting capacitor 90. Accordingly, during operation of the compressor 93, the<br>
operating stati'c capacitance is supplied to the supplementary winding 95 only through the<br>
operating capacitor 92. When a preset time period is passed after the third switch 91 is turned<br>
off, the second switch 89 is turned on, to lead the current of the utility power to the main winding<br>
94 through the turned on second switch 89 instead of the triac 88. In this instance, for stable<br>
operation of the control device, the triac 88 is kept turned on for a preset time period even after<br>
the third switch 91 is turned off and the second switch 89 is turned on. Thereafter, the current<br>
is provided to the main winding 94 only through the turned on second switch 89. Accordingly,<br>
the current of this time is not limited like in the starting, but normal of the utility voltage. On the<br>
other hand, if the first switch 82 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving<br>
control signal from the first controlling part 81, as a main controlling part, the utility voltage is<br><br>
supplied to the compressor 93 no more, to stop operation of the compressor 93.<br>
As explained, the fourth embodiment device of the present invention can optimize starting of the compressor as the phase control signal provided to the triac is varied with seasons, appropriately.<br>

FIG. 9 illustrates a diagram showing a device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a first controlling part 101 for controlling overall operation of the compressor 114, and providing a driving turn on/off signal for the compressor 114 according to a user's selection, a first switch 102 for supplying the utility voltage received from a utility power supply 103 or cutting off the supplying of th'e utility power to the compressor 114 in response to the driving turn on/off signal, a second controlling part 104 connected to an output contact point of the first switch 102 for sensing a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a size and a frequency thereof, and providing a phase control signal and a switching control signal according to the sensed voltage value and the frequency value, and a display signal according to the current flowing to the main winding 115 of the compressor 114, a current controlling part 106 for changing an internal circuit in response to the switching control signal and the phase control signal, and limiting the current of the utility voltage in supplying the current to the main winding of the compressor 114 during starting and releasing the limiting of the current after the starting, a current detecting part 108 connected to an output side of the current controlling part 106 for detecting a current to the main winding 115<br><br>
of the compressor 1124 and providing to the second controlling part, a display part 105 for<br>
displaying the state of the current to the main winding in response to the display signal, and a<br>
static capacitance controlling part 107 having a function for preventing a surge current caused<br>
by an internal momentary discharge for supplying a starting static capacitance and operative<br>
static capacitance from a current of the utility voltage to the starting supplementary winding 116<br>
of the compressor 114 during starting, and supplying only the operative static capacitance to the<br>
starting supplementary winding 116 of the compressor 114 after the starting by changing an<br>
internal circuit in response to the switching control signal. In FIG. 9, the current detecting part<br>
108 may be a resistor connected between the current controlling part 106 and the main winding<br>
115, and the display part 105 may be an LED(Light Emitting Diode). Hereafter, the display part<br>
will be an LED 105. In FIG. 9, the LED 105 flashes if the current to the main winding 115<br>
detected in response to the display signal is greater than a preset first overcurrent, turns on if the<br>
current is smaller than the first overcurrent and greater than a preset second overcurrent(the first<br>
overcurrent &gt; the second overcurrent), turns off if the current is smaller than the second<br>
overcurrent. However, the display method may be replaced with another display method. In FIG.<br>
9, the current controlling part 106 supplies a current to the main winding 115 in a direction the<br>
current is increased gradually between an initial starting point to a starting completion point in<br>
response to the switching control signal and the phase control signal. And, the current controlling<br>
part 106 includes a second switch 110 for switching over an output contact point of the first<br>
switch 102 and the main winding 115 in response to the switching control signal, and a phase<br>
controlling part 109 connected in parallel to the second switch 110 between an input contact point<br>
and an output contact point of the second switch 110 for controlling a phase of the current<br>
supplied to the main winding 115 depending on switching of the second switch 110. The static<br><br>
capacitance controlling part 107 includes a third switch 111 for switching over the supplementary winding 95 and the output contact point of the first switch 102 opposite to the second switch 110 in response to the switching control signal, and a static capacitance generating part 117 connected between the third switch 111 and the supplementary winding 116 for providing a required static capacitance to the supplementary winding 116 depending on a switching state of the third switch 111. In the current controlling part 106, in response to the switching control signal, the second switch 110 connects the output contact point of the first switch 102 and the main winding 115 through the phase controlling part 109 in starting, and connects the output contact point of the first switch 102 and the main winding 115 directly after the starting without passing through the phase controlling part 109. The third switch 111 is switched in response to the switching control signal, such that the static capacitance generating part 117 generates a starting static capacitance and an operation static capacitance of the current of the utility voltage in starting and only the operation static capacitance after the starting. The phase controlling part 109 is a triac and will be called as the triac 109 hereafter. The static capacitance generating part 117 in the static capacitance controlling part 107 includes a starting capacitor 112 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 111 and the supplementary winding 116 for providing a starting static capacitance required for a starting torque to the supplementary winding 116 in starting, and operation capacitor 113 connected between the third switch 111 and the supplementary winding 116 in series and in parallel to the starting capacitor 112 for providing an operating static capacitance in starting and after the starting.<br>
The operation of the fifth embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply 103(a utility voltage), the second<br><br>
controlling part(a microcomputer) 104 in the control device is initialized, and determines a state<br>
of the utility voltage, i.e., a voltage and a frequency thereof. And, the current detecting part 108<br>
detects a current flowing to the main winding 115 of the compressor 114 presently, and provides<br>
to the second controlling part 104.  Then, the second controlling part 104 generates a phase<br>
control signal and a switching control signal for providing to the current controlling part 106 and<br>
the static capacitance controlling part 107 according to the determined state of the utility voltage<br>
and the current to the main winding. That is, a starting time is determined, at which the utility<br>
power is provided to the starting capacitor 112 of the static capacitance controlling part 107, and<br>
the switching control signal is generated, and provided to the second switch 110 and the third<br>
switch 111. According to the switching control signal, the third switch 111 is turned on and the<br>
second switch 110 is turned off.   That is, the second switch 110 and the third switch 111 are<br>
operative oppositely in response to the switching control signal. In this instance, the second<br>
switch 110 and the third switch 111 have an overlap time period in which the second switch 110<br>
and the third switch 111 are in operation on the same time. And, the second controlling part 104<br>
provides the display signal for informing a state of the present current to the main winding 115<br>
of the compressor 114. As explained, the display signal may vary with a current value flowing<br>
to the main winding 115, presently.  That is, the second controlling part 104 compares the<br>
measured present current value to the main winding 115 and a preset reference overcurrent, to<br>
find a state of the present current value and provide a phase control signal consistent to the state.<br>
For example, in a case the current to the main winding 115 is greater than the preset first<br>
overcurrent, the I.ED 105 is made to flash to give alarm to the user, if the detected current is<br>
lower than the preset first overcurrent and greater than a preset second overcurrent, the LED 105<br>
is turned on so that the user can make a service call, and in a case the detected current to the main<br><br>
winding 115 is lower than the preset second overcurrent, the second controlling part 104, assuming that it as a regular state, turns off the LED. This display method may be replaced with other method. As explained in other embodiments already, the phase control signal is a rectangular signal provided to the gate of the triac 109, a duty ratio thereof is fixed based on a size of the utility voltage sensed already, and an output time point of the pulse is fixed based on the frequency value of the utility voltage sensed already. The supplementary winding 116 of the compressor 114 is required to be provided with a great static capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating capacitor 113 and the starting capacitor 112 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 111, to provide the starting static capacitance and the operation static capacitance to the supplementary winding 116 during starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operation supporting capacitor 113 is provided to the supplementary winding 116 as the third switch 111 is turned off(or opened) during operation of the compressor 114. As explained, the phase control signal and the switching control signal for the compressor 114 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage. That is, if the utility voltage is lower than reference voltages, turn on time periods of the triac 109 and the third switch 111 are set longer, to make the compressor 114 started well even at a lower voltage. Opposite to this, if the utility voltage is higher than the reference voltages, turn on time periods of the triac 109 and the third switch 111 are set shorter, for preventing flow of an excessive current to the main winding 115. For preventing flow of an excessive current to the main winding 115 in starting the compressor 114, as the phase control signal provided to the triac 109, a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 109 such that a fixed current of a first limited size flows to the main winding 115 during an initial period of<br><br>
starting, a gradually rising voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 109 such that a current gradually increasing from a first size to a second size flows to the main winding 115 during a middle period of starting, and a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a current of a second size flows to the main winding 115 continuously during a final period of starting. As explained, if the third switch 111 is turned on and the triac 109 comes into operation, to start the compressor 114, the third switch 111 is turned off to leave open, to cut off the static capacitance supplied to the supplementary winding 116 through the starting capacitor 112. Accordingly, during operation of the compressor 114, the operating static capacitance is supplied to the supplementary winding 116 only through the operating capacitor 113. On the other hand, if the first switch 102 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving control signal from the first controlling part 114, as a main controlling part, the current of the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 114 no more, and operation of the compressor 114 is stopped.<br>
As explained, the fifth embodiment device of the present invention permits to sense a current to the main winding always, and as a state of the sensed state is displayed to outside of the control device, the user to sense an overcurrent to the main winding.<br>
SIXTH EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a diagram showing a device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a first controlling part 121 for controlling overall operation of the compressor 134, and<br><br>
providing a driving turn on/off signal for the compressor 134 according to a user's selection, a<br>

value, the frequency value and a current value to the main winding 135 of the compressor 134,<br>
a current controlling part 125 for changing an internal circuit in response to the switching control<br>
signal and the phase control signal, and limiting the current of the utility voltage in supplying the<br>
current to the main winding 135 of the compressor 134 during starting and releasing the limiting<br>
of the current after the starting, a current detecting part 128 connected to an output side of the<br>
current controlling part 125 for detecting a current to the main winding 135 of the compressor<br>
134 and providing to the second controlling part 124, and a static capacitance controlling part 126<br>
for supplying a starting static capacitance and operative static capacitance from a current of the<br>
utility voltage to the starting supplementary winding 136 of the compressor 134 during starting,<br>
and supplying only the operative static capacitance to the starting supplementary winding 136 of<br>
the compressor 134 after the starting by changing an internal circuit in response to the switching<br>
control signal. In FIG. 10, the current detecting part 128 may be a resistor connected between<br>
the current controlling part 125 and the main winding 135. In FIG. 10, the current controlling<br>
part 125 supplies a current to the main winding 135 in a direction the current is increased<br>
gradually between an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to the<br>
switching control signal and the phase control signal.  And, the current controlling part 125<br>
includes a second switch 130 having an input contact point connected to the first switch 122 and<br><br>
an output contact point connected to the main winding 135 for switching over an output contact<br>
point of the first switch 122 and the main winding 135 in response to the switching control signal,<br>
and a phase controlling part 129 having an input terminal connected to an input contact point of<br>
the second switch 130 and an output terminal connected to an input terminal of the current<br>
detecting part 128 for controlling the current supplied to the main winding 135 depending on<br>
switching of the second switch 130 and the phase control signal.   The static capacitance<br>
controlling part 126 includes a third switch 131 for switching over the supplementary winding<br>
136 and the output contact point of the first switch 122 opposite to the second switch 130 in<br>
response to the switching control signal, and a static capacitance generating part 127 connected<br>
between the third switch 131 and the supplementary winding 136 for providing a static<br>
capacitance to the supplementary winding 136 required for starting and a time period after<br>
starting depending on a switching state of the third switch 131. In response to the switching<br>
control signal, the second switch 130 connects the output contact point of the first switch 122 and<br>
the main winding 135 through the phase controlling part 129 in starting, and connects the output<br>
contact point of the first switch 122 and the main winding 135 directly after the starting without<br>
passing through the phase controlling part 129. The third switch 131 is switched in response to<br>
the switching control signal, such that the static capacitance generating part 127 generates a great<br>
starting static capacitance in starting and a limited static capacitance after the starting.   In the<br>
current controlling part 125, the phase controlling part 129 is a triac operative in response to the<br>
phase control signal from the second controlling part 124, and will be called as the triac 129<br>
hereafter. The triac 129 will be turned on for a longer time period in response to a varied phase<br>
control signal if the utility voltage is lower than a reference utility voltage, and turned on for a<br>
shorter time period in response to the varied phase control signal if the utility voltage is higher<br><br>
than the reference utility voltage(for example, 110V or 220V). The static capacitance generating part 127 includes a starting capacitor 132 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 131 and the supplementary winding 136 for providing a starting static capacitance required for a starting torque to the supplementary winding 136 in starting, and operation capacitor 133 connected between the third switch 131 and the supplementary winding 136 in series and in parallel to the starting capacitor 132 for providing an operating static capacitance in starting and after the starting.<br>
The operation of the sixth embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 10. Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply 123(a utility voltage), the second controlling part(a microcomputer) 124 in the control device is initialized, and determines a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a voltage and a frequency thereof. And, the current detecting part 128 detects a current flowing to the main winding 135 of the compressor 134 presently, and provides to the second controlling part 124. Then, the second controlling part 124 generates a phase control signal and a switching control signal for providing to the current controlling part 125 and the static capacitance controlling part 126 according to the determined state of the utility voltage and the current to the main winding. That is, a starting time is determined, at which the utility power is provided to the starting capacitor 132 of the static capacitance controlling part 126, and the switching control signal is generated, and provided to the second switch 130 and the third switch 131. According to the switching control signal, the third switch 131 is turned on and the second switch 130 is turned off. That is, the second switch 130 and the third switch 131 are operative oppositely in response to the switching control signal. And, the second controlling part 124 provides a starting voltage value at the main winding 135 by multiplying the present current<br><br>
value to the main winding 135 of the compressor 134 and a resistance of the current delecting<br>
part 128(hereafter called as a resistor 128). The phase control signal may vary with the measured<br>
current to the main winding 135 presently, i.e., the starting voltage value. That is, the second<br>
controlling part 124 compares the measured present starting voltage value to a preset overvalues,<br>
to find a state of the present current value to the main winding 135 and vary the phase control<br>
signal consistent to the state.  For example, in a case the current to the main winding 135 is<br>
greater than the preset first overcurrent, the second controlling part 124 informs the fact to the<br>
first controlling part 121 so that the first controlling part 121 knows that the compressor 134 is<br>
in a critical state. Then, the first controlling part 121 applies a driving turn off signal to the first<br>
switch 122, to turn off, to open the first switch 122. Accordingly, the utility voltage will be<br>
supplied to the compressor no more, and the compressor 134 stops the operation. In a case the<br>
detected current to the main winding 135 is lower than the preset first overcurrent and greater<br>
than the preset second overcurrent, assuming that an overcurrent flows to the main winding 135,<br>
the second controlling part 124 reduces a width of the phase control signal applied to the gate of<br>
the triac 129 in a form of pulse. And, in a case the detected current to the main winding 135 is<br>
lower than the preset second overcurrent, assuming that it as a regular state, the second<br>
controlling part 124 maintains an initial phase control value as it is and provides to the triac 129.<br>
This phase control signal varying method may be replaced with other method. As explained in<br>
other embodiments already, the phase control signal is a rectangular signal provided to the gate<br>
of the triac 129, a duty ratio thereof is fixed based on a size of the utility voltage sensed already,<br>
and an output time point of the pulse is fixed based on the frequency value of the utility voltage<br>
sensed already. The supplementary winding 136 of the compressor 134 is required to be provided<br>
with a great static capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating<br><br>
capacitor 133 and the starting capacitor 132 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 131, to provide the starting static capacitance and the operation static capacitance to the supplementary winding 136 during starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operation supporting capacitor 133 is provided to the supplementary winding 136 as the third switch 131 is turned off(or opened) during operation of the compressor 134. As explained, the phase control signal and the switching control signal for the compressor 134 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage in an initial stage of operation of the compressor 134. That is, if the utility voltage is lower than reference voltages, turn on time periods of the triac 129 and the third switch 131 are set longer, to make the compressor 134 started well even at a lower voltage. Opposite to this, if the utility voltage is higher than the reference voltages, turn on time periods of the triac 129 and the third switch 131 are set shorter, for preventing flow of an excessive current to the main winding 135. For preventing flow of an excessive current to the main winding 135 iri starting the compressor 134, as the phase control signal provided to the triac 129, a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 129 such that a fixed current of a first limited, fixed size flows to the main winding 135 during an initial period of starting, a gradually rising voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 129 such that a current gradually increasing from a first size to a second size flows to the main winding 135 during a middle period of starting, and a fixed voltage is provided to the gate of the triac 66 such that a current of a second size flows to the main winding 135 continuously during a final period of starting. As explained, if the third switch 131 is turned on and the triac 129 conies into operation, to start the compressor 134, the third switch 131 is turned off to leave open, to cut off the current supplied to the supplementary winding 136 through the starting capacitor 132. Accordingly, during operation of the compressor<br><br>
134 after starting, the current is supplied to the supplementary winding 136 only through the operating capacitor 133. On the other hand, if the first switch 122 is turned off to leave open in response to a compressor driving control signal from the first controlling part 121, as a main controlling part, the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 134 no more, to stop operation of the compressor 134.<br>
As explained, the sixth embodiment device of the present invention permits to adjust an excessive starting voltage by detecting the starting voltage supplied to the compressor through the current detecting part, and stopping operation of the compressor or changing the phase control signal if it is assumed that the detected starting voltage exceeds a regular size.<br>
SEVENTH EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a diagram showing a device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a seventh preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor in accordance with a seventh preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a first controlling part 141 for controlling overall operation of the compressor 153, and providing a driving turn on/off signal for the compressor 153 according to a user's selection, a first switch 142 for supplying the utility voltage received from a utility power supply 143 or cutting off the supplying of the utility power to the compressor 153 in response to the driving turn on/off signal, a second controlling part 144 connected to an output contact point of the first switch 142 for sensing a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a size and a frequency thereof, and providing a switching control signal according to the sensed voltage value, and the frequency value, a current controlling part 145 having a resistance reversely proportional to a temperature<br><br>
thereof for changing an internal circuit in response to the switching control signal suitable for<br>
starting and a time period after the starting to limit the current of the utility voltage in supplying<br>
the current to the main winding 154 of the compressor 153 in starting and releasing the limiting<br>
of the current after the starting, and a static capacitance controlling part 146 for supplying a<br>
starting static capacitance and operative static capacitance from a current of the utility voltage<br>
to the starting supplementary winding of the compressor during starting, and supplying only the<br>
operative static capacitance to the starting supplementary winding of the compressor after the<br>
starting by changing an internal circuit in response to the switching control signal. The current<br>
controlling part 145 supplies a current to the main winding 154 in a direction the current is<br>
increased gradually between an initial starting point to a starting completion point in response to<br>
the switching control signal and the phase control signal by using a resistance reversely<br>
proportional to a temperature. And, the current controlling part 145 includes a second switch 148<br>
having an input contact point connected to the first switch 142 and an output contact point<br>
connected to the main winding 154 for switching over an output contact point of the first switch<br>
142 and the main winding 154 in response to the switching control signal, and a negative<br>
temperature coefficient resister connected between an output contact point of the first switch 148<br>
and the main winding 154 in series and connected to the second switch 148 in parallel between<br>
them for limiting a current to the main winding 154 in starting. The static capacitance controlling<br>
part 146 includes a third switch 152 for switching over the supplementary winding 155 and the<br>
output contact point of the first switch 142 opposite to the second switch 148 in response to the<br>
switching control signal, and a static capacitance generating part 149 connected between the third<br>
switch 152 and the supplementary winding 155 for providing a static capacitance to the<br>
supplementary winding 155 required for starting and a time period after starting depending on<br><br>
a switching state of the third switch 152. In response to the switching control signal, the second<br>
switch 148 in the current controlling part 145 connects the output contact point of the first switch<br>
142 and the main winding 154 through the negative temperature coefficient resister 147 in<br>
starting, and connects the output contact point of the first switch 142 and the main winding 154<br>
directly after the starting without passing through the negative temperature coefficient resister<br>
147. The third switch 152 in the static capacitance controlling part 146 is switched in response<br>
to the switching control signal, such that the static capacitance generating part 149 generates a<br>
starting static capacitance and a operating static capacitance in starting and only the operating<br>
static capacitance after the starting by changing an internal circuit of the third switch 152. The<br>
static capacitance generating part 149 in the second current controlling part 146 includes a<br>
starting capacitor 150 connected between an output contact point of the third switch 152 and the<br>
supplementary winding 155 for providing a starting static capacitance required for a starting<br>
torque to the supplementary winding 155 in starting, and an operation capacitor 151 connected<br>
between the third switch 152 and the supplementary winding 155 in series and in parallel to the<br>
starting capacitor 150 for providing an operating static capacitance in starting and after the<br>
starting.<br>
The operation of the seventh embodiment device for controlling supply of current and static capacitance to a compressor of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
Upon reception of the voltage of the utility power supply 143(a utility voltage), the second controlling part(a microcomputer) 144 in the control device is initialized, and determines a state of the utility voltage, i.e., a voltage and a frequency thereof. Then, the second controlling part 144 generates a switching control signal for providing to the current controlling part 145 and the<br><br>
static capacitance controlling part 146 according to the determined state of the utility voltage. That is, a starting time is determined, at which the utility power is provided to the starting capacitor 150 of the static capacitance controlling part 146, and the switching control signal is generated, and provided to the second switch 148 and the third switch 152. According to the switching control signal, the third switch 152 is turned on and the second switch 148 is turned off. That is, the second switch 148 and the third switch 152 are operative oppositely in response to the switching control signal. The supplementary winding 155 of the compressor 153 is required to be provided with a great static capacitance for improving starting characteristics. Accordingly, the operating capacitor 151 and the starting capacitor 150 are connected in parallel by the operation of the third switch 152, to provide the starting static capacitance and the operation static capacitance to the supplementary winding 155 during starting.<br>
In the meantime, once the starting is completed, only the operation capacitance from the operation supporting capacitor 151 is provided to the supplementary winding 155 as the third switch 152 is'turned off(or opened) during operation of the compressor 153. As explained, the switching control signal for the compressor 153 are dependent on the state of the utility voltage in an initial stage of operation of the compressor 153. That is, if the utility voltage is lower than reference voltages, a turn on time period of the third switch 152 is set longer, to make the compressor 153 started well even at a lower voltage. Opposite to this, if the utility voltage is higher than the reference voltages, the turn on time period of the third switch 152 is set shorter, for preventing flow of an excessive current to the main winding 154. In an initial starting of the compressor 153, if the second switch 148 is turned off to leave open and the negative temperature coefficient resister 147 is provided with the utility voltage, the negative temperature coefficient resister 147 limits the utility voltage thereby preventing an overcurrent from flowing to the main<br><br>
winding 154 of the compressor 153. The negative temperature coefficient resister 147 has an<br>
adequate initial resistance that can prevent a starting current supplied to the main winding 154<br>
in the starting of the compressor not to exceed a preset reference starting current. That is, as<br>
shown in FIG. 12, since the negative temperature coefficient resister 147 has a characteristic that<br>
the higher the temperature thereof, the lower the resistance thereof, the negative temperature<br>
coefficient resister 147 limits the starting current to the main winding 154 of the compressor 153<br>
by means of the initial resistance. In continuation, as shown in FIG. 12, if a current for the utility<br>
voltage is supplied to the negative temperature coefficient resister 147, the negative temperature<br>
coefficient resister itself generates heat to reduce the initial resistance, sharply.  Then, upon<br>
completion of the starting after a while, the switching control signal turns on the second switch<br>
148, to cut off the circuit, such that the current of the utility voltage flows to the main winding<br>
154 through the second switch 148 in a regular size without passing through the negative<br>
temperature coefficient resister 147. As explained, if the third switch 152 is turned on and the<br>
negative temperature coefficient resister 147 comes into operation, to complete the starting of the<br>
compressor 153, the third switch 152 is turned off to leave open, to cut off the starting static<br>
capacitance supplied to the supplementary winding 155 through the starting capacitor 150.<br>

capacitance is supplied to the supplementary winding 155 only through the operating capacitor<br>
151.   On the other hand, if the first switch 142 is turned off to leave open in response to a<br>

owing to the user's selection, the utility voltage is supplied to the compressor 153 no more, to<br>
stop operation of the compressor 153.<br>
As explained, the seventh embodiment device of the present invention permits, not only<br><br>
lo enhance a starting effect, but also to prevent supply of excessive current to the main winding, by limiting a starting current supplied to the compressor in an initial starting by using a negative temperature coefficient resister which has a resistance reversely proportional to a temperature.

includes the step of cutting off supply of the current to stop driving of the<br>
compressor if the starting voltage value is greater than a preset first reference<br>
voltage, controlling a phase of the current to reduce a size of the current if the<br>
starting voltage is lower than the first reference voltage and greater than a preset<br>
second reference voltage, for reducing a size of the current, and maintaining the<br>
current value if the starting voltage value is lower than the second reference<br>
voltage value.<br>
66.A method as claimed in claim 54, wherein the size of the current to the main<br>
winding during starting is limited by a negative temperature coefficient resister.<br>
67. A method as claimed in claim 54, wherein the size of the current to the main<br>
winding during starting is limited by a triac.	<br></td>
