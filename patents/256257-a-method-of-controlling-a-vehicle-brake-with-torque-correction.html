In the process developed by me plastic containers containing anticoagulant solutions intended for intravenous infusions, such as ACD, CPD, CPDA- , CPDA-2, protective solutions for erythrocytes,, thrombocytes and other blood components, intravenous fluids, aqueous solutions for parenteral feeding and for peritoneal dialysis are held are sealed within an outer protective plastic cover, and then sterilized by autoclaving. Indian Patent application No.519/MAS/92 relates to a process of manufacture of an autoclavable plastic container (containing an aqueous solution) free from bacterial or fungal contamination of the outer surface thereof. Several such sealed plastic containers after subsequent processing if necessary as described in copending Indian Patent applications 520/MAS/92 and 608/MAS/92 are packed within an impervious protective outer cover. Several such packs are placed within strong outer boxes made of several layers of corrugaged cardboard or any other protective outer packaging before despatch to the market.<br>
In the process described above, developed by me, the water vapour from the anticoagulant solution within the inner container escapes from the container, comes out of<br><br>
the protective plastic cover and finally gets trapped within the impervious outer protective cover. Such a humid atmosphere is very congenial for the grwoth of micro organisms on the protective plastic cover and also the inner surface of the impervious outer protective cover.<br>
Contamination of the protective plastic cover could happen during any or all of the operations subsequent to the sterilisation of the bags by acute laving, such as removal from the autoclave, transportation, inspection, counting and placement within the impervious outer protective cover. Once contamination has occurred, the micro organisms can grow fast in the humid and warm atmosphere provided by the packaging system. Preventing the grwoth of micro organisms on the outer surface of the protective plastic cover and the inner surface of the impervious outer protective cover is a very serious problem during the manufacture of plastic containers within which aqueous solutions intended for intravenous infusions such as anticoagulants - ACD, CPD, CPDA-1, CPDA-2, protective solutions for erythrocytes, thrombocytes, other blood components, intravenous fluids, solutions for parenteral feeding, and solutions for peritoneal dialysis by the process developed by me.<br><br>
I have been sensed of this problem and have worked out serial approaches to eliminate the growth of micro organisms on the outside of protective outer covers. The techniques developed consist offs<br>
(a)	Denying essential elements needed for the  survival and growth of micro organisms.<br>
(b)	Destroying micro organisms by radiation.<br>
(c)	Destroying  micro organisms by the use of  chemical agents.<br>
This patent application relates to preventing the growth of micro organisms by denying them access to oxygen necessary for their sustenance by removing the air in contact with them and replacing it with nitrogen or carbon dioxide. In the developed process, plastic bags containing aqueous solutions which have been sealed within protective plastic covers and further processed as necessary are packed inside impervious protective outer covers. The outer covers are connected to a suction device to remove air and then nitrogen or carbon dioxide is introduced at the bottom of the container and allowed     to    fill    the    bag    and     overflow<br><br>
inured to remove any residual air still remaining in the bags. The procedure has to be conducted in such a manner that oxygen present in the air is effectively replaced by the nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The outer cover is then squeezed to bring it to a convenient size and then the open side is heat sealed immediately.<br>
The plastic protective cover enclosing each plastic container holding an anticoagulant or other aqueous solutions is usually made of polypropylene. Other polymers such as high density polethylene, high molecular weight high density polyesthylene, biaxial oriented polypropylene, polyester, nylon or multilayered films consisting of one or more of the above polymers could also be used, the essential requirement being that they should be sterilisable by autoclaving.<br>
The outermost impervious protective cover or container in which several plastic containers holding an anticoagulant or other aqueous solutions individually sealed within plastic: protective covers are placed, is made of one or more layers of plastics such as polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester    and    nylon,    in    which    at    least<br><br>
one of the layers is made of impervious plastics such as polyvinylidine chloride, polyvinylidine fluoride and or aluminium foil. It is sometimes desirable to have special quality paper as outermost layer since this enables multi-coloured printing to be done on it.<br>
A multi layered plastic film consisting of polyethylene of thickness 5-100 microns, aluminium foil 5-20 microns and polyester 5-30 microns and having an overall thickness of 60 to 150 microns and above has been found to be quite good. In place of bags made of the multilayered sheet described above, moulded containers made of multilayered films could be used in which at least one film should be made of polyvinylidine chloride or polyvinylidine fluoride or aluminium foil. An essential feature of the outermost protective cover is that it should not allow oxygen to pass through it.<br>
It should be ensured that, the annular space between the outermost impervious protective cover and the plastic protective cover within which the plastic bag containing the aqueous solution is held is free of oxygen. This is ensured by evacuating the air from the annular space by suction followed by displacement of any air still within it  by  introducing  an inert gas such  as  nitrogen  or<br><br>
carbon dioxide at the bottom of the chamber through a tube and allowing the inert gas to fill the chamber and overflow.<br>
The invented process thus consists a process for the manufacture of intravenous and other parenteral infusions in plastic containers free from contamination by micro organisms on the outer surface thereof and also on the outer surface of the plastic protective containers within which they are sealed, characterised in that any micro organisms present on the plastic protective covers are prevented from developing and multiplying by denying them access to life supporting protective plastic outer covers with an inert gas such as or carbon dioxide,<br>
It is desirable to ensure that any residual oxygen still remaining inside the impervious outer protective cover or which leaked into it from outside through defects in the outer cover is continuously removed. This can be done by keeping a seethe containing oxygen absorbing agent within the outer cover. The nature of the oxygen absorbing agent and its container and the process for making it is covered by a separate patent, application.<br><br><br>
