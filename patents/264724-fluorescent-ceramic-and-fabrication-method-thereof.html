Fluorescent ceramic and fabrication method thereof<br>
The present invention is directed to a fluorescent ceramic having the general formula Gd2O2S doped with M, whereby M represents at least one element selected from the group Ce, Pr, Eu, Tb, Yb, Dy, Sm and/or Ho.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for manufacturing a fluorescent ceramic using single-axis hot pressing.<br>
The invention still further relates to a detector for detecting ionizing radiation.<br>
The invention still further relates to a use of said detector for detecting ionizing radiation.<br>
Fluorescent members for detecting high-energy radiation contain a phosphor that can absorb the radiation and convert it into visible light. The luminescent emission thereby generated is electronically acquired and evaluated with the assistance of light sensitive systems such as photodiodes or photomultipliers. Such fluorescent members can be manufactured of single-crystal materials, for example, doped alkali halides. Non-single-crystal materials can be employed as powdered phosphor or in the form of ceramic members manufactured therefrom.<br>
It is a drawback of the known method (see e.g. US 5,518,659) that said powders with grain sizes from 10 nm to 100 nm are chemically unstable when stored in air leading to surface oxidation of the powder. The surface oxidation inevitably leads to a second undesirable phase in a volume of the resulting ceramics. The second phase disadvantageously contributes to scattering within the volume of the ceramics thus decreasing the light output. It must be noted that the surface oxidation occurs even during a short period of handling raw material in air, e.g. weighing it and loading the press-mold. In order to reduce oxysulfate to oxysulfide it is suggested in US 5,518,659 to use a reducing atmosphere in the course of hot pressing, with gas pressure in the furnace space up to 0.1 MPa, approximately atmospheric pressure. However, due to the<br><br>
presence of the atmospheric gas counter-pressure in pores of the polycrystalline brick, compacting is limited. Thus the pores cannot be closed completely so that optimal microstructure cannot be formed.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a scintillating ceramics with a still further improved light output and afterglow characteristics.<br>
The above-described objective can be achieved according to the present invention by a method for manufacture of a fluorescent ceramic material using a single-axis hot pressing, whereby said inventive method comprises the steps:<br>
a)	selecting a pigment powder of Gd2O2S doped with M, and M<br>
represents at least one element selected from the group of Eu,<br>
Tb, Yb, Dy, Sm, Ho, Ce and/or Pr, whereby the grain size of said<br>
powder used for hot-pressing is of 1 µm to 20 µm, and said hot-<br>
pressing is carried out at<br>
-	a temperature of 1000° C to 1400° C; and/or<br>
-	a pressure of 100 MPa to 300 MPa;<br>
b)	air annealing at a temperature of 700° C to 1200° C for a time<br>
period of 0.5 hours to 30 hours.<br>
The pigment powder of Gd2O2S can comprise an amount of M from 0.1 ppm to 1000 ppm (weight fraction).<br>
It is found out that relatively coarse-grained powders, which are chemically stable in air, can be successfully pressed to form a fluorescent crystal with improved characteristics.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention it can be preferred that the pressing mode is at<br>
a temperature of 1000° C to 1400° C, preferably of 1100° C to 1300° C, more preferably of 1150° C to 1250° C; and/or a pressure of 100 MPa to 300 MPa, preferably of 180 MPa to 280 MPa and more preferably of 200 MPa to 250 MPa. Preferably, the vacuum during the step of uni-axial pressing according to the present invention is  0.01 Pa.<br><br>
According to the present invention the vacuum can be adjusted in the range of &gt; 0.01 Pa and  0.01 Pa and  0.01 Pa and 
The fluorescent ceramic, after the step of single-axis hot-pressing under      vacuum, can be further treated by air annealing at a temperature of 700° C to 1200° C, preferably of 800° C to 1100° C, more preferably of 900° C to 1000° C; whereby said time period for air annealing treatment is 0.5 hours to 30 hours, preferably 1 hours to 20 hours, more preferably 2 hours to 10 hours and most preferably 2 hours to 4 hours.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that Gd2O22S material with      an average grain size in the range of 1 µm to 20 µm can be commonly purchased by manufactures of the fluorescent ceramics as a raw material and do not need to be broken up to finer particles of less than 100 nm. In an embodiment it is preferred that GdaO2S pigment powder used according to the present invention has an average grain size in the range of 2 µm to 10 µm and more preferably of 4 µm to 6 µm. Moreover, due to the method of the invention no specific powder production process is necessary, as conventionally available powders may be successfully used for manufacturing of luminescent ceramics.<br>
Following ceramics parameters have been achieved with the method according to the invention:<br>
an afterglow in the range of 1 x 10-6 to 8 x 10-6 at 500 ms; and/or a total transparency in the range of 0 to 50%, preferably 10% to 50%, still preferably 20-50% measured for a wavelength of 513 nm.<br>
The ceramics of the present invention can be advantageously used for manufacturing x-ray luminescent ceramics that serve as raw material in fabrication of medical computer tomographs (CT).<br>
It is found to be advantageous to introduce the vacuum annealing step for still further improving optical properties of resulting ceramics. During this step a further grain growth in the ceramics takes place which further improves transparency due to a decrease in porosity. Next to this, due to the grain growth an additional diffusion of a dopant atoms in the lattice of oxysulfide enables still further improving scintillating properties of the ceramics.<br><br>
Therefore, according to one embodiment of the method according to the present invention between step a) and step b) an additional step c) can be carried out, whereby step c) comprises annealing fluorescent ceramic under vacuum at a temperature of 1000° C to 1400° C for a period of time of 0.5 hours to 30 hours.<br>
Preferably, the annealing temperature is selected in the range of 1100° C to 1300° C, more preferably of 1200° C to 1250° C.<br>
The time period for vacuum annealing can be preferably set to 1 hours to 20 hours, more preferably to 2 hours to 10 hours and most preferably 3 hours to 5 hours.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the method according to the present invention for step a) an undoped Gd2O2S powder with a grain size between 1 µm and 20 µm is mixed with a composition comprising at least one element of the group of rare earth ions comprising Pr, Ce, Eu, Tb, Yb, Dy, Sm and/or Ho.<br>
This technical measure still further simplifies a process of ceramics manufacturing as a broad range of available materials can be used. For example, in case Pr or Ce are selected as envisaged dopants, an introduction of Pr or Ce ions can be carried out using aqueous solutions of corresponding salts: PrCh, PrBr3, Prl3, Pr(NO3)3, Pr2(SO4)3, CeCl3, CeBr3, Cel3, Ce(NO3)3, Ce2(SO4)3, etc. Alternatively, the introduction of dopant ions can be carried out during a mechanical mixture of powders of Gd2O2S with insoluble compositions comprising the dopant, like oxides, for example PrsOn, Pr2O3, Ce2O3, CQO2.<br>
Still alternatively Gd2O2S powder may be mechanically mixed with water insoluble salts of the dopant, like PrF3? Pr2S3, Pr2O2S, Pr2(CO3)3, Pr2(C2O4)3, CeF3, Ce2O2S, Ce2(CO3)3, Ce2(C2O4)3, an there like.<br>
This principle of a dopant introduction may be used for introduction of ions such as Tb, Eu and other rare earth elements. Additionally, ions of other elements not being rare earth ions may be introduced accordingly. Preferably, a suitable sintering aid is co-mixed prior to hot-pressing. Various sintering aids are per se known in the art.<br>
The invention further relates to ceramics being represented by a chemical formula of Gd2O2S doped with M, whereby M represents at least one element selected from the group Pr, Ce, Eu, Tb, Yb, Dy, Sm and/or Ho, whereby said fluorescent ceramic comprises a single phase in its volume.<br><br>
Due to the technical measure of the invention, namely an absence of foreign phases in the volume of resulting ceramics, its transparency value is increased.<br>
Further it has been found that the fluorescent ceramic of the present invention can have a significantly increased relative light yield or light output relative to ceramic fluorescent material that is available on the market. The difference is especially seen for a ceramic thickness of equal or more than 1.5 mm. The light output can be a factor of 2.3 higher than that of cadmium tung state crystals of the same thickness.<br>
The doped pigment powder of Gd2O2S can have a surface according to BET in the range of &gt; 0,01 m2/g and  0,05 m2/g and  0,1 m /g and 
The Gd2O2S can be doped by at least one element selected from the group of Ce Pr Eu, Tb, Yb, Dy, Sm and/or Ho. It is preferred that the Gd2O2S powder is doped by one element selected from the group of Ce, Pr, Eu, Tb, Yb5 Dy, Sm and Ho only. Most preferred is the use of an element of Ce or Pr.<br>
The content of Ce in the Gd2O2S powder in a weight fraction can be from 0.1 ppm to 100 ppm , preferably 5 ppm to 50 ppm and more preferably 10 ppm to 25 ppm and/or the content of Pr in the Gd2O2S powder can be from 100 ppm to 1000 ppm, preferably 300 ppm to 800 ppm and more preferably 500 ppm to 800 ppm.<br>
It has been found that the Gd2CO2S fluorescent ceramics of the present invention can have a significantly reduced afterglow in the range of 1 x 10-6 to 8 x 10-5 at 500 ms. The fluorescent ceramic of the present invention can preferably have an afterglow in the range of 1.0 x 10-6 to 6 x 10-5 at 500 ms, preferably of 1.0 x 10-6 to 5 x 10-5 at 500 ms and more preferred of 1.0 x 10-6 to 3.0 x 10-5 at 500 ms.<br>
Fluorescent ceramics according to the present invention are preferably subjected to an uni-axial hot pressing during the manufacture. At the step of uni-axial hot pressing the polycrystaUine brick is compacted preferably down to density values close to theoretical density of Pref 99.7% Ptheir. Due to the high densities, the fluorescent ceramics of the present invention can provide a good transparency in the optical range. It is therefore preferred that the fluorescent ceramic of the present invention has a density of &gt; 99.0 %, preferably of &gt; 99.5 % and more preferred &gt; 99.7 % and 
 <br>
Further it has been surprisingly found that the fluorescent ceramic of the present invention can have a significantly increased relative light yield or light output in the range of 0.74 to 1.00, preferably of 0.80 to 1.00 and more preferably of 0.84 to 1.00.<br>
The size of the crystallites of the fluorescent ceramic according to the present invention is preferably higher compared with the grain size of the starting powder of the M doped Gd2O2S grains. It is preferred that &gt; 50 %, preferably &gt; 70 % and more preferred &gt; 90 % of the M doped Gd2O2S crystallites of the fluorescent ceramic should have a crystallite size of 1 to 300 µm, preferably of 10 to 100 µm.<br>
The fluorescent ceramic according to the present invention can have a texture in the plane 001, which corresponds to a plane in a lattice oriented substantially perpendicular to a direction of a pressure applied during a process of uni-axial pressing.<br>
Thus, in general there are two alternatives to manufacture fluorescent ceramic material according to the present invention. The alternative I involves steps a) and b) whereas the alternative II comprises steps a), b) and c), whereby step c) is carried out between step a) and step b).<br>
The invention will further be illustrated by a specific embodiment of example 1 to 12 of the invention. Examples 1 to 12<br>
The initial raw material of examples 1 to 12 of table I with a grain size as given in table I are subjected to uniaxial hot pressure under vacuum of about 0.1-1 Pa. The pressing temperature is given in table I and the pressure is 200 MPa for examples 1 to 5, 7 to 10 and 12 and 250 MPa for examples 6 and 11 followed by air annealing, except for comparative example 1.<br>
The data for examples 1 to 12, relative light yield and afterglow in 10-6 at 500 ms is given in table I below.<br><br><br>
Examples 13 to 21<br>
The initial raw material according to examples 13 to 21 of table II with a grain size of 6µm to 9 µm are subjected to uniaxial hot pressure under vacuum at about 0.1 - IPa. The pressing temperature is given in table II and the pressure is 250 MPa for examples 13 and 14 and 200 MPa for examples 15 to 21. Examples 13, 15, 18 and 20 are treated by air annealing at conditions given in table II. Examples 14, 16, 17, 19 and 21 are treated by annealing under vacuum at 1 Pa and then treated by air annealing at conditions given in table II.<br><br>
The data for examples 13 to 21, relative light yield and afterglow in 10-6 at 500 ms, is given in table II below.<br><br>
In the process of vacuum annealing at 1200° C to 1300° C grain growth takes place in ceramics and a decline in its residual porosity occurs, which results in an increase of the ceramics transparency. The total transmission at 513 nm natural<br><br>
emission wavelength raises by about 5 % to 15 % over that of the sample prior to heat treatment. Compared to the ceramics air heat treatment only, ceramics of the present invention subjected to annealing in vacuum and afterwards in air have a higher light output in luminescence due to their higher transparency. The measurements of total transmission were carried out using a Hitachi 330 spectrometer adapted with integrating sphere of 60 mm diameter.<br>
Annealing in air leads to a significant rise in ceramics light output of about 3-fold and a substantial decline in afterglow of about 10-fold. After vacuum pressing and annealing in vacuum the stoichiometry of the Gd2O2S crystalline structure with respect to oxygen and sulfur is disturbed resulting in a rise of the concentration of detrimental electron traps in said ceramic. Considerable improvement in x-ray luminescence characteristics of ceramics after annealing in air is determined by the stochiometry of the crystalline structure of ceramics in order to obtain the optimum performance of the fluorescence ceramics of the present invention. Light output and afterglow was measured with a Hamamatsu PMT of National Instruments ADC, whereby the photomultiplier is shielded against direct irradiation by lead shield. The afterglow was measured with 120 kV / 100 mA, 80 cm FDD (18-20 mGy/s), 2 s pulse, whereby all afterglow values are given in ppm of stationary signal. The signal values (light output) were measured on 4 x 4 mm" pixels, silicone glued to a photodiode.<br>
The fluorescent ceramic according to the present invention can be used for example in<br>
a scintillator or fluorescent member for detecting ionizing radiation, preferably x-rays, gamma rays and electron beams; and/or<br>
an apparatus or device used in the medical field, preferably for a computer tomography (CT).<br>
Most preferred at least one fluorescent ceramic according to the present invention can be used for a detector or apparatus adapted for medical imaging.<br>
However, the fluorescent ceramic can be used for any detector known in the medical field. Such detectors are for example X-ray detector, CT-detector, Electronic Portal Imaging detector, and there like.<br><br>
