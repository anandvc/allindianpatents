				<td>Device at a card for textile fibers as cotton and similar things, is case of which in the coverlying opposite to the drum fitting an orifice for the induction of air in the direction of the drum fitting and at the leastan orifice for the discharge of the air with short fibres, trash and similar things away from the cylinder clothing are prevalent<br>
The cylinder of the card displays a high circumferential speed (more than 15 ra/sec) and leads at its surface much air along with it. Thereby there adjusts at the cylinder an underpressure in the peripheral area (between cover and drum fitting). The fibres are held on the one hand by the teeth of the drum fitting and are transported and on the other hand held by the earlier mentioned under pressure at the cylinder surface. The fibre structure is open upto the individual fibre.<br>
In case of a known device (EP 0 338 802) a first cover following the direction of rotation, a second cover in the form of a trimmed carding element, which is adjusted radially in the proximity of the drum fitting than the first cover, a third cover of at least 20 mm, which in the circumferential direction seen from the second cover is separated by a first split (gap) and is adjusted radially further from the cylinder clothing than the second cover, as well as a fourth cover is existent, which is separated in the circumferential direction seen from the third cover by a second split and also displays a separating edge, which is formed in such a manner, that it deflects from the drum fitting a part of air stream, which flows during the rotation of the drum under the third covering.<br>
1A<br><br>
The close adjustment of the second cover builds an air chamber, through which a pressure gradient immediately downstream of the second cover develops that means, in the sphere of the first gap. This pressure gradient is increased by the adjustment of the third cover, which is attached by the drum surface further as the second cover, in order to induct a fast supply air flow through the first gap. Above the first gap a lubricating device is provided, which is shaped in such a manner, that air is sucked in the first gap only gap only from the side of the card. At this device the supply air is compulsorily drawn in. The rotation air flow of the drum is checked strongly by the close adjustment of the second cover.<br>
The only sucked-in supply air flow is too weak, to detach short fibres, trash and similar things effectively from the long fibres and to lead-away from the fibre material. Besides that, it is disturbing, that the air sucked-in from the machine room contains dust and similar things, which is led-in in the fibre material.<br>
The invention has therefore taken the problem as the basis, to arrange a device of the nature mentioned in the introduction, which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which renders possible in a simple manner especially an increased detachment and discharge from the short fibres, trash and similar things from the fibre material and averts securedly the entry of the dust and similar things in the fibre material.<br>
The solution of this problem follows the distinguishing features of the patent claim number 1.<br>
2<br><br>
The detachment and discharge of the short fibres, trash and similar things from the fibre material prevalent on the drum is achieved in a simple manner by the measures in accordance with the invention. The compressed air stream is reflected by the cylinder surface and takes therefore the disturbing impurities along with outwards. The strength of the compressed air stream is adjustable, so that detachment and discharge take place optimally. A further advantages exists therein, that the compressed air stream is free from the disturbing impurities.<br>
Appropriately the orifice for the supply air, seen in the direction of rotation of the drum is introduced to the orifice for the exhaust air. Preferably by orifice for the supply air seen in the direction of rotation of the drum is subsequently stored. Advantageously at least at one orifice an exhaust nozzle is connected for the exhaust air. It is preferred that at least one orifice for the exhaust air a separating border (edge) is available against the direction of rotation of the drum.<br>
Effectively, the distance between the cover element and the surface of the drum is adjustable. Preferably, the orifice for exhaust air is throughout split (column)-shaped. The orifice from a multiple of blast nozzles exist with advantage.<br>
Preferably the orifice stretches itself for the supply air through the width of the drum. Effectively the supply air is directed to the drum under an angle. Preferably the supply air is directed under a right angle in respect of the tangent at the drum surface.<br>
3<br><br>
With advantage the supply air directed against the rotation of direction of the drum. Preferably the supply air is directed in the direction of rotation of the drum. Appropriately the supply air is diverted. Preferably there passes through the supply air through a nozzle or similar tilings. With advantage there passes through the supply air through the fibre materials. Preferably there passes through the supply air between neighbouring saw-teeth-wires. Expediently the supply air is reflected by the drum surface. Preferably there flows the supply air continuously. With advantage there amounts the strength of the supply air stream around 100 to 400 Pa. Preferably there amounts the width of the orifice for the supply air around 0.15 to 0.5 mm. Appropriately there amounts the volume flow for the supply air around 100 to 2503/h.<br>
The invention is explained in details with reference to the accompanying drawings below in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is Schematically a lateral view of a card with device in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 represents the device as per figure 1 in the detail;<br>
Fig. 3a, 3b represent entry, pass through and discharge of the air streams in respect of the cylinder fitting and<br>
Fig. 4 is another embodiment of the invention.<br>
4<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a card, for example, Truetzschler-Hochleistungskarde DK 903 (Truetzschler high capacity card), with feeder roller 1, feeding table, licker-in 3a, 3b, 3c, drain 4, receiver 5, stripper roller 6, crushing cylinder 2, 8 web guide element 9, web funnel 10, suction roller 11, 12 and erratic (shifting), cover 13 with slowly rotating cover bars 14. The direction of rotation of the roller of the card are indicated by a bent arrow head. At the exit of the card there exists a can coiler 16 with cans 15 for storing band. With A the direction of operation (fibre material flow direction), with 4a the clothing of the cylinder 4, with 4b the direction rotation of the drum 4 and with 17 the card sliver is indicated. Between the front cover guide pulley 14b and the receiver 5 the device 18 as per the invention is attached.<br>
As per figure 2 seen in the rotation of direction 4b of the cylinder a pressure chamber 19 and separating Knife 20 with a separating border prevalent one after another. The pressure chamber 19 displays one of the drum fittings 4a in lying opposite in a distance under bottom wall 19', in which a continuous orifice 21 stretching itself to the width of the cylinder 4 is existent. In the top wall 19" an orifice existent, to which a compressed air pipe is connected, which is connected to a compressed air source 23 (pls. see fig. 1). Between the wall 19', the compressed air chamber 19 and the separating border 20' of the separating knife 20 attached under an angle an orifice continuously stretching itself continuously through the width of the drum 4 is existent, which is a suction hood is connected.<br>
There flows a compressed air stream pl through the compressed air pipe 22, which enters in the inner room 19" of the compressed air chamber 19, in the inner room 19" builds the compressed air stream p/2 exits through the orifice<br>
5<br><br>
21 from the inner room 13" again. Through the orifice 21 there enters a compressed air stream p/6, which contains small fibres, trash, dust and similar things in the inner room of the suction chamber 25 and is sucked off from there through a (not represented) sucking-off device.<br>
According to figure 3a there enters the compressed air stream p/2 essentially vertically through the orifice 21 and appear at the cylinder 4a with the fibre material 26 to be processed (pls. See fig. 4). The compressed air stream p/2 penetrates through, according to figure no.3b, the fibre material 26 existent in the holes between the teeth 4' and rebound at least partly on the surface of the cylinder 4" (and on the top side of the dedendum, that means, the twist flanks, of the endless all steel cylinder) and also to the flank of teeth 4'. There the air stream p/2 is divided in such a manner, that a partial air stream, p/3 flows opposite to the direction of rotation 4b and a partial air stream p/4 in the direction of rotation 4b. The air stream p/2 is reflected in this manner. The partial air stream p/4 detaches small fibres, trash and similar things from the long fibres; the long with from the teeth 4' in the direction of rotation 4b, whereas the partial air stream p/4 enters with the small fibres, trash and similar things to the orifice 24 in the suction chamber 25. There the partial air stream p/3 and are diverted through the surface of the drum I" 4" and flow back under a transversal running angle.<br>
In this manner a cover element 19 is connected in series to the orifice 24 (separating point with which air stream p/2 is blown to the cylinder surface 4' through a narrow split (gap) 21.  Since the air stream p/2 enters through-the processed fibre material 26 and through the cylinder surface 4" lying thereunder is recoiled (recoil impulse) are transported outwards with the air<br>
6<br><br>
streams (the small fibres are transported outwards with the air stream, since these are not so well retained by the drum fitting 4a as long fibres. Thereby the subsequently switched orifice 24 (separating point) can optimally separate the small fibres.<br>
According to the figure no.4a separating element 27 is pre-supported to the separating knife 20 as opposed to the direction of rotation 4b, in which the feed for the compressed air stream is integrated. Seen in the direction of rotation 4b there are one after another a cylinder cover element 28, an orifice 29, the separating element 27, the orifice 24 and the separating knife 20 are attached. The drum cover element 28 is fixable in the direction of the arrow head, B,C parallel to the cylinder shell surface and with a fixing element for example bolt 30 with oblong hole. Thereby the width a of the orifice 29 can be adjusted. The bottom surface 27' of the separating element 27, which lies opposite to the tips of the cylinder 4a in a distance, the orifice 21 displays for the exit of the compressed air stream p/2. The distance of the bottom surface 27' to the tips of the drum fitting 4a is adjustable in the direction of the arrow head D, £. With b the width of the orifice 24 is designated, which is sufficient from the end of the bottom surface 27' upto the separating edge 20' existing at the downstream. Above the orifice 29 there exists a suction hood 31, which is sucked-off with the air stream p/5, loaded with the small fibres, trash and similar things.<br>
There comes to the effect of the whirling up also the effect of a throttling and of a stowing effect before the orifice 24 (separating point) especially through the separating point, that means the lighter small fibres are retained and whirled up and the long fibres are carried through by the drum fitting 4a.<br>
