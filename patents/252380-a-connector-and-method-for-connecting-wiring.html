This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference herein in its entirety, pending United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/473,913 (Attorney Docket No. 2003P07862US), filed 28 May 2003.<br><br>
Background<br>
United States Patent No. 5,599,211 (Kurahashi), which is incorporated herein by reference, allegedly recites a "fixed terminal hingably supports a movable terminal of a terminal device. A terminal screw passes through a hole in the fixed terminal to engage a threaded hole in the movable terminal. A captivating device prevents the terminal screw from being withdrawn from the fixed terminal. The terminal screw, when tightened, clamps an element to be connected between the fixed and movable terminals. The captivating device, when the terminal screw is loosened, urges the movable terminal away from fee fixed terminal to separate the two, thereby positively releasing the element connected therebetween." See Abstract<br><br>
United States Patent No. 4,090,762 (Hoffman), which is incorporated herein by reference, allegedly recites a "terminal connection which will accept electrical conductors of various sizes and provides oxide breaking, spring loading, and conductor confining and bundling features. A tab or finger on one of the terminal elements presses the conductor regardless of its size toward the other terminal element, and oxide breaking edges on one of the elements break oxide coatings on the conductor while the tab or finger both confines the conductor and forces it toward a mechanical operator such as a screw. Forcing the conductor toward the screw reduces offset loading and permits additional oxide breaking by scraping the conductor with the screw as the screw is rotated to tighten the terminal. In the case of a stranded conductor, the bundling obtained by forcing the conductor toward the screw assures good interstrand electrical contact, so that the electrical resistance at the connection is not significantly different from the resistance of a corresponding solid conductor. In several embodiments, the tab or finger provides the spring loading or spring follow required to maintain good electrical and mechanical characteristics of the connection. In some embodiments, a struck-out leg provides spring loading and the biting action for oxide breaking." See Abstract<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments comprise a system comprising: a connector for electrically coupling a plurality of wires to a printed circuit board of a programmable logic controller, a termination end of each of the plurality of wires stripped of insulation, said connector comprising: a housing defining a plurality of a co-planar plurality of openings; and a plurality of clamps, each of which is adapted to receive the stripped termination end of at least one of the plurality of wires via the corresponding opening; wherein said plurality of screw-actuated clamps are disposed in an alternating proximal-distal relationship with respect to said co-planar plurality of openings.<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view, FIG. 2 is a front view, and FIG. 3 is a top view, of an exemplary embodiment of a system 1000, which can be used as a connector 1100 for electrically coupling a plurality of wires 1200 to, for example, an information device, a network interface card, and/or a printed circuit board (PCB), such as a PCB of a programmable logic controller (PLC) and/or any other type of information device. Wires 1200 can convey input signals, output signals, control signals, power, and/or grounding. Wires 1200 can be any size, such as for example, from about 22 gage to about 14 gage.<br>
Connector 1100 can comprise a housing 1110 that defines any number of cages 1300. Each cage 1300 can define a cage opening 1320 at an entrance to a tapered channel 1340 that leads within cage 1300. All of the cage openings 1320 can be co-planar, that is, all of cage openings 1320 can be aligned with a front plane defined by housing 1110 and/or connector 1100, and/or a plane slightly recessed from that front plane. <br><br>
Disposed substantially within, and/or comprised by, each cage 1300 can be a wire damping device 1400. In certain exemplary embodiments, the wire clamping device can be implemented as a screw-actuated clamp, which can comprise a rotatable but non-linearly progressing screw head 1410 that is coupled to a rotatable but non-linearly progressing screw shaft (shown in FIG. 5). Screw-actuated clamp 1400 can also comprise a pair of damping jaws 1460,1470, at least one of which can be moved by die rotation of screw head 1410.<br><br>
One or more wires 1210,1220 can be coupled to connector 1100 via one or more screw-actuated clamps 1400, such as via a releasable clamping action of screw-actuated clamps 1400. For example, a bare end 1230 of wire 1210, such as an end of wire that has been stripped of insulation 1240, can be terminated by electrical contact within cage 1300, such as electrical contact with one or more jaws of screw-actuated clamp 1400. In certain embodiments, multiple wires can be terminated within a single clamp 1400. For example, a single clamp 1400 can be dimensioned to receive and/or terminate two 14 gage wires.<br>
An electrically conductive path can be formed from at least a portion of screw-actuated clamp 1400, such as clamping jaw 1470, to a corresponding pin 1500 coupled thereto. A. substantially longitudinally parallel set of pins 1500 can be inserted into holes located through the PCB and soldered to die PCB. Alternatively, pins 1500 can be inserted into a receiving socket mounted on the PCB, or can be integral to die socket and insertable into connector 1100, thereby non- destructively removably connecting connector 1100 and/or wires to die PCB. In either case, the connection of wired connector 1100 to PCB can form an electrically conductive path from the wires to the PCB. The portion of tins electrically conductive path that flows through connector 1100 can repeatedly and/or sustainably cany and/or accommodate up to approximately 300 volts and/or up to approximately 10 amps.<br><br>
As shown, screw heads 1410 can be arranged and/or disposed in an alternating proximal-distal relationship with respect to cage openings 1320 and/or a front surface. That is, a first, third, .. .etc., screw head can be disposed relatively closer to die front surface and/or front plane defined 
<br>
BIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken at section A-A of FIG. 2, and FIG. S is a cross-sectional view taken at section B-B of FIG. 3. As shown, a bare end 1230 of each of wires 1210 and 1220, each of which penetrates cage opening 1320 and resides within channel 1340 that leads within cage 1300.<br><br>
Screw-actuated clamp 1400 can comprise a screw head 1410, a screw-restraining collar 1420, an axially-restrained screw shaft 1430, a thread follower 1440, one or more sidewalls 1450, a movable clamping jaw 1460, a stationary clanging jaw 1470 opposingly disposed to movable clamping jaw 1460. Collar 1420 and/or a similar mechanism can substantially prevent and/or resist movement of screw head 1410 and/or screw shaft 1430 in a (Erection parallel to the longitudinal axis of screw shaft 1430 when screw head 1410 and/or screw shaft 1430 is rotated.<br><br>
Thread follower 1440 can be threaded to substantially match and/or mate with threads of screw shaft 1430. Thread follower 1440 can convert rotation of screw shaft 1430 of screw-actuated clamp 1400 to a linear, up-and-down and/or back-and-forth motion of sidewalls 1450.<br><br>
Coupled to sidewalls 1450 can be a movable clamping jaw 1460, which can track die movement of sidewalls 1450. Clamping jaw 1460 and/or clamping jaw 1470 can have a ridged and/or serrated surface to facilitate improved grasping of wire ends 1230.<br>
Screw head 1410, which can be roughly 3.8 millimeters in diameter, can repeatedly and/or sustainably transmit an applied torque of at least about 5 inch-pounds to and/or axially restrained screw shaft 1430, and via interaction with thread follower 1440, that torque can be converted to a force that can move sidewalls 1450, movable clamping jaw 1460, and/or wire ends 1230. "When clamped between movable clamping jaw 1460 and stationary clamping jaw 1470, wire ends 1230 can be electrically conductively coupled to pins 1500.<br><br>
By staggering the locations of screw heads 1410, cages 1300, and/or wire ends 1230, a desired separation distance and/or isolation between screw heads 1410, cages 1300, and/or wire ends 1230 can be maintained. For example, connector 1100 can provide for a pitch and/or center-to-	cento: distance between wire ends 1230, and/or between wire ends 1230 and screw heads 1410, of approximately 4 millimeters. With respect to screw heads 1410 and/or stationary clamping jaws 1470, a single row and/or layer of wires 1200 can be formed via use of connector 1100, thereby potentially facilitating a view of and/or access to connector 1100 and/or an installation, modification, and/or removal of connector 1100 from the PCB and/or one or more wire ends 1230 from connector 1100.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 6000 for electrically coupling one or more wires to a PCB. At activity 6100, a termination end of a wire can be stripped of insulation. At activity 6200, the bare termination end of one or more wires can be inserted through a cage opening and/or into a cage of a housing of a connector. At activity 6300, a screw-actuated clamps can be utilized to clamp the termination end of the one or more wires. At activity 6400, the connector can be coupled to the PCB. At activity 6500, one or more of the termination ends can be released from the corresponding clamp. At activity 6600, the connector can be de-coupled and/or released, perhaps nondestructively, from the PCB.<br><br>
FIG. 7 is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a known connector system that comprises a "double stack" of screw-actuated clamps. One row of clamps and associated cages is provided at a lower level, and a second row of clamps and associated cages is provided at an upper level. To couple the same number of wires to a PCB as can be coupled using system 1000 ~ of FIG. 2, the double-stack approach requires at least a "taller" and "deeper" connector, and potentially a wider connector as well, thus requiring a larger "footprint" on the PCB. Moreover, wires of the upper level can interfere with seeing and/or accessing screw heads of the lower level.<br><br>
