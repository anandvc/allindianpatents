The invention relates to a device for deflecting sections of strip, in particular metal strip, in a coiling plant, from a beginning guide channel to an end guide channel and vice-versa, comprising a driver with a pair of driver rollers and control elements arranged downstream of the direction of movement of the strip, comprising a switch that can be swivelled towards the beginning guide channel or the end guide channel, and a guide table which is swivel ably held below said switch, with said guide table being able to be positioned against the lower driver roller in the manner of a. wiper.<br>
An essential element of the function of such a deflection device in a coiling plant consists of the beginning of the strip, the so-called strip head, of a strip following the strip end of the preceding strip, being fed to a different coil than the preceding strip end. To this effect, two different strip guide channels are available to the sections of strip, namely a so-called "beginning guide channel" and a corresponding "end guide channel". Thus, during a change of strip, each strip has., to be deflected from a beginning guide channel to an end guide channel - and vice versa. In practical application this is required both for a multiple reeling plant and for a rotor-type or turret coiler.<br>
For sections of strip which follow at adequate spacing, there is sufficient time to carry out the required deflection without any problem because all the elements of the deflection device involved can be moved to the subsequent position before the following strip comes in.<br>
However, the smaller the spacing of subsequent sections of strip, the faster strip change has to take place. As a result of this, finally, time-critical positioning<br>
. processes arise which in extreme cases may cause damage and/or incorrect<br>
,  switching.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to state a deflection device in a coiling plant which, while avoiding time-critical positioning processes, safely prevents the above-mentioned difficulties and incorrect switching actions and ensures safe functioning during the deflection process even in cases where the distance between following sections of strip is extremely small.<br><br>
This object is met in a device for deflecting sections of strip, in particular metal strip, in a coiling plant of the type mentioned in the precharacterising part of claim 1, in that the top and the bottom of the switch are of convex shape and in that said switch is arranged at the outlet end of an associated strip transport roller-conveyor so as to be articulated in such a way that in the raised position said switch opens up the beginning guide channel, and in that the guide table is of concave shape which corresponds to the bottom of the switch, and in that an actuating mechanism each is associated with both the switch and the guide table, such actuating mechanism being e.g. a hydraulic unit. This makes it possible, even before the strip end has passed, to position the strip end such that the path to the end guide channel or to the beginning guide channel is open. This eliminates the danger of the strip tearing, or even more seriously, of pieces being torn off, due to said strip being guided past the sharp-edged point of the switch.<br>
This embodiment according to the invention makes possible unproblematic deflection of the sections of strip even if there is extremely little spacing between subsequent sections of strip.<br>
Further embodiments of the device are provided according to the characteristics of the subordinate claims.<br>
Below, the invention is shown in detail by means of drawings. The following are shown:<br>
Figure 1 the deflection device with beginning guide channel and end guide channel between parts of a roller conveyor and comprising a driver in an inclined plane y-y with the switch resting against the upper driver roller;<br>
Figure 2 the deflection device with the switch lowered and resting against the guide table at a driver position in the vertical plane x-x and with the strip moving through the beginning guide channel between the guide table and the switch;<br><br>
Figure 3 an incoming strip head which is guided to the end guide channel via the lowered switch;<br>
Figure 4 with the driver position and switch position unchanged, the strip is conveyed through the end guide channel;<br>
Figure 5 the switch in the upper position and the driver in the inclined plane y-y; the switch positions the outgoing strip end against the upper driver roller, in this way preparing the way for the following strip head in the end guide channel;<br>
Figure 6 the strip head of the following strip which is guided into the beginning guide channel;<br>
Figure 7 the guide surfaces of the switch and the guide table, which guide surfaces comprise glide rollers.<br>
Figures 1 to 7 show in detail the deflection device, according to the invention, for a rolling strip in a coiling plant, with the coiler not shown, which can be a multiple reeling plant or a rotor-type or turret-coiler.<br>
The beginning guide channel 1 and above it the end guide channel 2 are provided for separable guidance of the uncoiling strip 9 or 9'. According to Figure 2 the strip head 11 follows the strip end 10 which moves towards the driver 3 on the left-hand section 7 of the roller conveyor at relatively quick succession. For further conveyance, said strip head 11 is taken up and pulled through by the conveying gap between the driver rollers 4, 4'.<br>
In this arrangement, the driver rollers are drive ably held in each case either in a vertical plane x-x or in an inclined plane y-y, according to the following ■'description. When the strip 9, 9' passes the run-off side, said strip is guided into the beginning guide channel 1 or the end guide channel 2, depending on the position of the switch 5 and of the guide table 6. Positioning of these preferably takes place by means of hydraulic units 8, 8'. The letter B designates the direction of movement of the strip through the deflection device according to the invention.<br><br>
The top and the bottom of the switch 5 are of convex shape and are thus able in their raised position in the function of a wiper to snugly fit against the upper driver roller 4. Accordingly, the top of the guide table 6 is of concave shape so as to match the bottom of the switch 5 for the purpose of providing a positive fit, while the free end of said guide table 6 is likewise shaped for positive fit against the lower driver roller 4'. Thus the guide table 6 meets the requirement for an additional function as a wiper against the lower driver roller 4'.<br>
The free end of the switch 5 is in the shape of two convex sides meeting at a point. This makes it possible for said point to snugly fit against the concave back of the guide table 6 almost without a gap, as is shown for example in the Figures 2 to 4.<br>
By associating the section 7' of the strip transport roller-conveyor on the run-off side in relation to the driver roller pair 4, 4' downstream in the direction of movement B of the strip, jolt-free passage is afforded to the strip head 11 which passes while the switch 5 is in its lifted position. Finally, according to the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 7, the guide surfaces of both the switch 5 and the guide table 6 can comprise relatively small glide rollers 12, which in the guide channels 1 and 2 respectively leads to a reduction in friction and thus to a reduction in wear caused by friction.<br>
Deflection of sections of strip from a beginning guide channel or beginning conveyance path to an end guide channel or end conveyance path and vice versa takes place as follows:<br>
1.     The strip is deflected from the beginning guide channel 1 to the end guide channel 2;<br>
In the case of sections of strip which follow in close proximity, in the case of strip passage through the beginning guide channel 1, the switch 5 is kept in the upper position while the guide table 6 is kept in the lower position (Figure 1).<br>
Shortly before the strip end passes by, the guide table 6 is moved to an upper position. At maximum coil diameter, the strip 9 is then only placed<br><br>
onto the roller 1' at the end of the guide table 6 or said strip 9 slightly bends around said roller 1'.<br>
Before the strip end 10 moves through, the switch is switched in downward direction, thus pressing the strip 9 against the guide table 6, and in so doing opening up the way into the end guide channel 2 (Figure 2).<br>
The upper driver roller 4 is placed vertically above the lower roller 4'. In this way the strip head 11 of the following strip 9' can enter the end guide channel 2 while the strip end 10 of the preceding strip 9 is pulled through the guide gap between the switch 5 and the top of the guide table 6 (Figures 3 and 4).<br>
2. The strip is deflected from the end guide channel 2 to the beginning guide channel 1. To this effect, the upper driver roller 4 is pushed into the y-y plane so that the strip 9 is directed towards the beginning guide channel 1.<br>
The switch 5 is pushed from the bottom against the strip 9' and against the upper driver roller 4 so that the way into the beginning guide channel 1 is free, namely for the following strip head 11'. The guide table 6 is in its bottom position (Figure 5).<br>
The strip end 10 which runs into the end guide channel 2 is pulled through between the upper driver roller 4 and the end edge of the switch 5, while the strip head 11 of the following strip is directed to the beginning guide channel.<br>
The measures explained above eliminate the danger of the strip ripping, or of pieces being torn off, due to said strip being guided past the sharp-edged point of the switch 6.<br><br>
