THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC METHODS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel substituted 3-pyridyM-aryipyrroles and<br>
their therapeutic and prophylactic uses. Disorders treated and/or prevented<br>
using these compounds include inflammatory and AIDS-related disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
TNF-a and p38-Related Disorders<br>
Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a are produced via the activity of<br>
kinases. Such kinases include the Cytokine Suppressive Antiinflammatory<br>
Drug-Binding Protein (CSBP)/p38 kinase, a Mrtogen-Activated Protein (MAP)<br>
kinase family of serine-threonine protein kinases. inflammatory cytokines play<br>
an important role in a number of inflammatory disorders (1), neurodegenerative<br>
disorders (10), and AIDS-related disorders (11-14). Although the precise<br>
mechanism of kinases such as p38 is unknown, p38 has been implicated in<br>
both the production of TNF-a and the signaling responses associated with the<br>
TNF-a receptor (6).<br>
Arthritis is a prime example of an inflammatory disorder, and is thus the<br>
"inflammatory disorder focused on most in this section. Arthritis affects millions<br>
of people and can strike at any joint in the human body. Its symptoms range<br>
from mild pain and inflammation in affected joints, to severe and debilitating<br>
pain and inflammation. Although the disorder is associated mainly with aging<br>
adults, it is not restricted to adults.<br>
The most common rheumatoid arthritis therapy involves the use of<br>
nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) to alleviate symptoms.<br>
However, despite the widespread use of NSAID's. many individuals cannot<br>
tolerate the doses necessary to treat the disorder over a prolonged period of<br>
time. In addition, NSAID's merely treat the symptoms of disorder without<br>
affecting the underlying cause.<br>
Other drugs such as methotrexate, gold salts, D-penicillamine and<br>
prednisone are often used when patients fail to respond to NSAIO's. These<br>
drugs also have significant toxicities and their mechanism of action remains<br>
unknown. Monoclonal antibodies to TNF-a and receptor antagonists to<br>
interieukin 1ß (IL-1ß) have been shown to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid<br>
arthritis in small-scale human clinical trials (2).<br>
In addition to protein-based therapies, there are small molecule agents<br>
that inhibit the production of these cytokines and have demonstrated activity in<br>
animal rheumatoid arthritis models (3). Of these small molecule agents. SB<br>
203580 has proven effective in reducing the production of TNF-a and IL-1ß in<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocyte cell lines with IC80<br>
values of 50 to 100 nM (4).<br>
In addition to in vitro testing results, SB 203580 has been shown to<br>
inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines in rats and mice at IC50 values<br>
of 15 to 25 mg/kg (5). SB 203580 reduces the production of inflammatory<br>
cytokines by inhibiting the activity of CSBP/p38 kinase at an IC50 of 200 nM (6).<br>
Due to SB 203580's oral activity and potency in animal models, researchers<br>
have suggested that a compound with such an activity profile has potential as<br>
a viable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (5).<br>
Pyridyipyrroles and their analogs have also been prepared as cytokine<br>
inhibitors and glucagon antagonists (7), and specifically as inhibitors of IL-1ß.<br>
TNF-a and other cytokines. Arylpyrroles (8) and triaryipyrroles (9) have also<br>
been prepared as cytokine inhibitors.<br>
The role of CSBP/p38 has been implicated recently in various<br>
neurodegenerative and AIDS-related disorders. With regard to<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, p38 has been shown to have a role in<br>
determining whether a cell survives or undergoes neuronal programmed cell<br>
death or apoptosis (10,11).<br>
Also related to AIDS, the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus<br>
HHV8 has been shown to encode a G protein-coupled receptor that activates<br>
p38. It has been proposed that this activation contributes to tumorigenesis and<br>
angiogenesis leading to Kaposi's sarcoma (12).<br>
Associated with AIDS is the rapid activation of p38 induced by infection<br>
of a CCR5* human T cell line by SIV, suggesting that p38 may play a role in<br>
early viral infection (13). Additionally. p38 inhibitors have been shown to block<br>
HIV replication in vitro in a manner that may be TNF-a-independent (14).<br>
Absence of Clinically Effective Agents<br>
In general, arthritis — particularly rheumatoid arthritis — and the host of<br>
other inflammatory and AIDS-related disorders all take a severe toll on those<br>
afflicted. There is a tremendous need for small molecule agents to treat these<br>
disorders. To date, however, no such agents have ever been identified and<br>
shown to be clinically effective in humans.<br>

Experimental Details<br>
I. General Synthetic Schemes<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized<br>
in accordance with the general synthetic methods described below and<br>
illustrated in the following general schemes. The products of some schemes<br>
can be used as intermediates to produce more than one of the instant<br>
compounds. In those cases, the choice of intermediates to be used to produce<br>
subsequent compounds of the present invention is a matter of discretion that is<br>
well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.<br><br>
Scheme 1 can be used to produce the compounds of the invention<br>
where R1 is methyl. Compound 1a, such as a 1,2-disubstituted alkyne, can be<br>
used as the starting material for Scheme 1. 1,2-disubstituted alkynes can be<br>
prepared following known procedures. The substituents X and R3 of the<br>
compounds of the invention are determined by the substituents of Compound<br>
1a. Compound 1a is combined with trimethytamine-N-oxide and dissolved in a<br>
dry solvent, such as THF, and cooled to 0oC. A base, such as lithium<br>
diisopropyiamide, is added and the reaction is stirred at 0oC for 1 h to give<br>
Compound 1b as the product.<br><br>
Scheme 2 can be used to prepare compounds of the invention where R1<br>
is hydrogen. Compound 2a, of the type 1-[(1-isocyano-2-(3-rnethoxy-<br>
phenyl)ethenyl)sulfonyl]-4-methylbenzene can be used as the starting material<br>
for Scheme 2. Compound 2a can be prepared following known procedures.<br>
The substituent R3 of the compounds of the invention are generally determined<br>
by the substituents on the phenyl of the ethynyi group in Compound 2a; the X<br>
atom is determined by the heteroaromatic substituent of the acetate group in<br>
Compound 2b. Compound 2a is dissolved in a dry solvent, such as ethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether, and added dropwise to a mixture of Compound 2b, such<br>
as ethyl 4-pyridylacetate, and a base, such as potassium t-butoxide, in a dry<br>
solvent, such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, at OX. After the addition is<br>
complete, the reaction is warmed to 25°C and stirred for 3 h to give the<br>
intermediate Compound 2c. When R3 is methoxy, the intermediate Compound<br>
2c can be treated with a demethylating agent, such as BBr3, in an inert<br>
solvent such as CH2CL2, at -78°C to give Compound 2d.<br><br>
Scheme 3 can be used to produce the compounds of the invention<br>
where R1 is hydrogen and R2 is substituted or unsubstituted. Compound 3a, a<br>
diaryl substituted a,ß-unsaturated ester, can be used as the starting material<br>
for Scheme 3. Compounds of this type can be prepared following known<br>
procedures. Compound 3b can be the other starting material, a substituted<br>
tosylmethyi isocyanide (tosMIC) derivative that can be prepared following<br>
known procedures.<br>
For example, Compound 3a can be ethyl 4-fluoro-a-[(4-<br>
pyridyl)methylene)benzeneacetic acid and Compound 3b can be 1-(4-<br>
tolylsurfonyl)-1-(3-phenylpropyl)methyl isocyanide. Compound 3a and<br>
Compound 3b are dissolved in dry solvent, such as ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether, and added dropwise to a -40oC mixture of a base, such as potassium t-<br>
butoxide, in a dry solvent, such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Stirring at -<br>
40°C is continued for 1 hour before allowing the temperature to rise to -20°C.<br>
Accordingly, the resulting Compound 3c is 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-3-(4-pyridyl)pyrrole (Compound 27).<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, Compound 2c and Compound 3c can be used<br>
as intermediates to form other compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
Scheme 4 can be used to produce the compounds of the invention<br>
where R1 is substituted. Intermediate Compound 2c or Compound 3c is added<br>
portionwise to a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent, such as<br>
dimethylformamide, at 0°C. After the addition is complete, the reaction is<br>
stirred at 0°C an additional 15 minutes followed by portionwise addition of an<br>
alkylating agent, such as 4-(2-chloroethyl)morpholine hydrochloride. The<br>
reaction is heated to 60°C for 16 hours before the temperature is allowed to<br>
cool to 25°C to produce Compound 4a.<br><br>
Scheme 5 can be used to produce the compounds of the invention<br>
where R1 is substituted. When R1 is 4-nitrophenyi, the intermediate<br>
Compound 4a can be reduced using a catalyst, such as palladium on carbon in<br>
a solvent, such as ethyl acetate, to give Compound 5a. The amine Compound<br>
5a can be treated with an acytating agent, such as acetic anhydride, in a<br>
solvent, such as water, to give the product Compound 5b.<br><br>
Scheme 6 can be used to produce the compounds of the invention<br>
where R2 is an alkyl chain containing heteroatoms. Intermediate Compound 3c<br>
is exposed to reducing conditions using a catalyst, such as palladium on<br>
carbon in a solvent, such as ethanol, to which a catalytic amount of acid, such<br>
as concentrated hydrochloric acid, is added to give Compound 6a. The alcohol<br>
Compound 6a can be treated with an sulfonating agent, such as mesyl<br>
chloride, and a base, such as triethylamine, in a solvent, such as CH2CI2, to<br>
give the intermediate Compound 6b. Compound 6b can then be heated with a<br>
nucleophile, such as morpholine, in a solvent, such as CH2CI2, to give<br>
Compound 6c.<br>
II. Specific Compound Syntheses<br>
Specific compounds which are representative of this invention can be<br>
prepared as per the following examples. No attempt has been made to<br>
optimize the yields obtained in these reactions. Based on the following,<br>
however, one skilled in the art would know how to increase yields through<br>
routine variations in reaction times, temperatures, solvents and/or reagents.<br>
The products of certain syntheses can be used as intermediates to<br>
produce more than one of the instant compounds. In those cases, the choice<br>
of intermediates to be used to produce compounds of the present invention is a<br>
matter of discretion that is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art<br><br>

III. Biological Assays and Activity<br>
A. p38 Inhibition In-Vitro Enzyme Assay<br>
A solution (38 µL) of purified recombinant p38 (6xHis-p38 expressed in<br>
E.coli). myelin basic protein substrate (determined empirically), and a buffer of<br>
pH 7.5 (Hepes:25 mM, MgCl2:10 mM, MnCl2:10 mM) were added to 92 wells of<br>
a 96-well round bottom polypropylene plate. The amount of enzyme was<br>
determined empirically based on the linear range of the assay and the<br>
acceptable signal to noise ratio. The remaining wells were used for control<br>
("CTRL") and background ("BKG"). The CTRL was prepared with the enzyme,<br>
substrate buffer and 2% DMSO, and the BKG was prepared with substrate<br>
buffer and 2% DMSO.<br>
A solution (12 µL) of the test compound in DMSO was added to the<br>
testing wells. Compounds were diluted to 125 µM in 10% DMSO/H2O and<br>
assayed at 25 µM where the final DMSO concentration was 2%. The ATP/33P-<br>
ATP solution (10 µL containing 50 µM unlabeled ATP and 1 µCi 33P-ATP) was<br>
added to all wells and the completed plates were mixed and incubated at 30°C<br>
for 30 min. Ice-cold 50 % TCA/10 mM sodium phosphate (60 yL) was added<br>
to each well and the plates were kept on ice for 15 min. The contents of each<br>
well were transferred to the wells of a 96-well filterptate (Millipore, MultiScreen-<br>
DP) and the filterplate was placed on a vacuum manifold fitted with a waste<br>
collection tray. The wells were washed five times with 10% TCA/10 mM<br>
sodium phosphate (200 µL) under vacuum. MicroScint-20 scintillant was<br>
added, and the plates were sealed using Topseal-S sheets and counted in a<br>
Packard TopCount scintillation counter using a 33P liquid program with color<br>
quench correction, where the output is in color quench-corrected cpm. The %<br>
inhibition of each test compound as shown in Table 2 was calculated by the<br>
following formula: % inhibition = {1- (sample -BKGy(CTRL-BKG)] x 100.<br><br><br>
Although compounds were initially tested at 20 µM. when warranted, the<br>
compounds were also tested at 4-fold increments above and below that<br>
concentration. In addition, the IC50 was calculated for some compounds using<br>
the Oeltagraph 4-parameter curve-fitting program.<br>
B. In-Vitro Whole Cell Assay for TNF-a Inhibition<br>
Freshly obtained venous blood was anticoagulated with heparin, diluted<br>
with an equal volume of phosphate buffered saline ("PBS") and placed in a<br>
sterile tube or other container. Aliquots (30 mL) of this mixture were<br>
transferred to centrifuge tubes which were underlaid with Ficoll-Hypaque (15<br>
mL). The prepared tubes were centrifuged at 400 x g, without braking, for 30<br>
min at room temperature. Approximately 1/2 to 2/3 of the platelet layer above<br>
the mononuclear cell band was removed with a pipette. The majority of the<br>
mononuclear cell layer was carefully removed using a pipette and these<br>
PBMC's were diluted with PBS and spun at 600 x g for 15 min. The resulting<br>
PBMC's were washed with another portion of PBS and spun at 400 x g for 10<br>
min at room temperature. The recovered pellets were diluted in low endotoxin<br>
RPMI /1% FCS culture medium, and gave a cell concentration of 0.5-2.0 X 106<br>
PMBC/ mL. A small volume of the suspension was removed for counting on a<br>
hemocytometer and the remaining preparation was centrifuged at 200 x g for<br>
15 min at room temperature. The recovered pelleted PMBCs were<br>
resuspended in RPMI /1% FCS to a concentration of 1.67 x 106/mL.<br>
To run the assay, the PBMC suspension (180 µL) was transferred to<br>
duplicate wells of a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plate and incubated for 1 h at<br>
37°C. A solution of test compound (10 µL: prepared at 20 x the desired final<br>
concentration) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 1 h at<br>
37°C. A solution (10 nL) of LPS in RPMI /1 % FCS (200 ng/mL) was added<br>
and the wells were incubated overnight at 37oC. The supemate (100 µL) was<br>
removed from each well and diluted with RPMI /1% FCS (400 µL). The<br>
samples were analyzed for TNF-a using a commercial ELISA kit (Genzyme).<br>
Select compounds of the invention are listed in Table 3. The<br>
compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit TNF-a production. The IC50,<br>
nM results are listed for the indicated compounds.<br><br>
C. In Vivo Rodent Assay for Inhibitipn of TNF-a Production<br>
The ability of the instant compounds to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-a<br>
production was demonstrated in the following in vivo rodent assays. Mice<br>
(BALB / cJ females, Jackson Laboratories) or rats (Lewis males, Charles River)<br>
were fasted for 30 min prior to oral dosing with 5-10 mL/kg of test compound at<br>
5-50 mg/kg. Thirty minutes after dosing, the animals were injected<br>
intraperitoneally with LPS at 1 mg/kg and returned to their cages for 1 h.<br>
Animals were anesthetized by CO2, exsanguinated by cardiac puncture and<br>
whole blood collected (0.1 - 0.7 mL). The blood was allowed to dot and serum<br>
was transferred to a centrifuge tube. This sample was centrifuged, and serum<br>
was collected, aliquoted and frozen at -80X. Samples were tested by<br>
commercial ELISA's for TNF-a (Endogen for mouse TNF-a and Biosource for<br>
rat TNF-a). The in vivo test results for select compounds of the invention are<br>
listed in Table 4. The compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit TNF-a<br>
production in mice and the data are listed as % inhibition at 25 mg/kg.<br>
The in vivo test results for select compounds of the invention are listed<br>
in Table 5. The compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit TNF-a<br>
production in mice and the data are listed as % inhibition at 10 mg/kg.<br>
