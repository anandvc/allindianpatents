Methods, optical recording apparatus using such methods and optical recording medium for use by the methods and the apparatus<br>
The invention relates to a method for setting an optimum value of a write parameter for use in an optical recording apparatus for writing information on an optical recording medium by means of a radiation beam, the method comprising a first step of writing a series of test patterns on the recording medium, each pattern being written with a 5     different value of a write power level (P) of the radiation beam, a second step of reading the patterns so as to form corresponding read signal portions, and a third step of deriving a value of a read parameter from each read signal portion. The invention also relates to a method for setting an optimum value of the write power level of the radiation beam.<br>
The invention also relates to an optical recording apparatus for recording<br>
10     information on an optical recording medium, comprising a radiation source for emitting a radiation beam having a controllable value of a write power level for recording information on the recording medium a control unit for recording a series of test patterns, each pattern being recorded with a different value of the write power level, a read unit for reading the patterns and forming corresponding read signal portions, and first means for deriving a value<br>
15     of a read parameter from each read signal portion.<br>
The invention also relates to an optical recording medium for recording information by irradiating the recording medium by means of a radiation beam, the recording medium comprising an area containing control information indicative of a recording process whereby information can be recorded on said recording medium, the control information<br>
20     comprising values of recording parameters for the recording process.<br>
A method and apparatus according to the first paragraph are known from the European patent application No. EP 0 737 962. The apparatus uses a method which includes the following steps for setting the optimum write power (Popt) of the radiation beam. First the 25     apparatus records a series of test patterns on the recording medium, each pattern with<br>
increasing write power (P). Next, it derives the modulation (M) of each pattern from the read signal corresponding to the pattern. It calculates the derivative of the modulation (M) as a function of the write power (P) and normalizes the derivative by multiplying it by the write power (P) over the modulation (M). The intersection of the normalized derivative (y) with a<br><br>
preset value (ptarget) determines a target write power level (Ptarget). Finally, the target write power (Ptarget) is multiplied by a parameter (p) so as to obtain a write power level (Popt) suitable for recording on the recording medium. The value of the parameter (p) is read from the recording medium itself. The test patterns are recorded on the recording medium by<br>
5     applying write power (P) values in a range around a given value (Pjnd) which is also read from the recording medium itself.<br>
In an optical recording apparatus it is important to record information on optical recording media with the correct power of the laser beam. A media manufacturer cannot give this correct power in an absolute way (for example, pre-recorded on the disc)<br>
10     because of environment and apparatus -to- apparatus deviations for every recording medium and recording apparatus combination. The known method for setting the optimum write power (Popt) takes the different characteristics of the recording media into account by measuring the modulation (M) of the test patterns written on the recording media. Furthermore, this method is independent of the specific recording apparatus. The method is<br>
15     designed for providing a proper setting of the write power for each combination of recording apparatus and recording medium.<br>
However, it is a disadvantage of the known method that it is not always possible to determine an accurate and unambiguous value for the target write power level (Ptarget) and, therefore, for the optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P). This is-<br>
20     because of the measurement noise introduced during the measurement of the values for the modulation (M) of each pattern. This measurement noise increases with decreasing write power (P) of the test patterns. It appears that even when the measured modulation values are averaged so as to reduce the measurement noise, sometimes a sort of plateau occurs in the y-curve, thus preventing the determination of an unambiguous value for the target write power<br>
25       level (Ptarget).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method according to the opening paragraph which determines an accurate and unambiguous optimum value for a write parameter wherefrom an optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P) can be 30     derived.<br>
This object is achieved when the method set forth in the preamble is characterized in that the method also comprises a fourth step of curve-fitting a function defining a relation between the read parameter and the write power level (P) to the values of<br><br>
the read parameter and of the write power level (P), and a fifth step of setting an optimum value of the write parameter in dependence on a property of the curve-fitted function.<br>
It is observed that in the known method the noise in the measurement of the read parameter is significantly amplified by the differentiation step necessary to obtain the<br>
5     normalized derivative (y). In the method according to the invention this differentiation step is omitted and a function is curve-fitted directly to the values of the read parameter versus the values of the write power level. This curve-fitting may be done by any fitting algorithm such as, for example, the well-known least-squares algorithm. An optimum value of the write parameter is obtained from this curve-fitted function.<br>
10	Generally speaking, any function of arbitrary shape that defines a relation<br>
between the read parameter and the write power level (P) can be used. However, it should be noted that a straight line can be very easily and accurately curve-fitted. Therefore, arranging the values of the read parameter and of the write power level (P) in such a way that a straight line could be curve-fitted is advantageous and should be preferred.<br>
15	In a version of the method according to the invention the read parameter is a<br>
modulation (M) of the amplitude of a read signal derived from information recorded on the recording medium. This modulation (M) is computed from the following expression<br>
M= ((IH-IL)/IH)-100, where IR is the highest level of the amplitude and II is the lowest level of the amplitude in the<br>
20     read signal derived from reading information recorded on the information carrier comprising longer marks such as, for example, marks having a length of 14 times the channel bit length when Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation Plus (EFM+) coding is employed.<br>
A preferred version of the method according to the invention is characterized in that the curve-fitted function is of the form<br>
25	P-M = a-(P-(3),<br>
wherein a and p have values resulting from the curve-fitting, and in that the optimum value of the write parameter is set to be substantially equal to the value of p.<br>
When the values of the modulation (M) times the write power level (P) are plotted versus the write power level (P), a function represented by a substantially straight line<br>
30     can be curve-fitted. Physically this straight line is limited by the lowest write power and the highest write power used when writing the series of test patterns. It is an advantage of this version of the method according to the invention that a straight line can be very easily and accurately curve-fitted by way of known fitting algorithms.<br><br>
The curve-fitted straight line is described by its properties a and p\ The<br>
optimum value of the write parameter is set to be substantially equal to the value of (3, i.e. the<br>
value for the power level (P) for which the extrapolated straight line crosses the P-axis. It is a<br>
further advantage of this version of the method according to the invention that each straight 5     line has just a single crossing with each of the axes. Therefore, the optimum value of the<br>
write parameter can unambiguously be determined because there is only a single crossing of<br>
the curve-fitted straight line with the P-axis.<br>
A version of the method according to invention is characterized in that the<br>
curve-fitting of the straight line in the fourth step is carried out in a predetermined fit range of 10     write power levels. Because the curve fitted straight line is a first order approximation of the<br>
relation between the read parameter and the write power level, the curve-fit should be carried<br>
out in an appropriate fit range of write power levels.<br>
Such an appropriate fit range is, for example, a range of write power levels<br>
around an indicative power level (Pj„d) recorded on the recording medium as control 15     information indicative of the recording process, for example, a range between CDfPind, and<br>
o&gt;2-Pind where coi and ©2 are predetermined values. An especially advantageous fit range is<br>
found to be a range of write power levels between 0.85-Pjnd and 1.15-Pjnd.<br>
A preferred method according to the invention is characterized in that the<br>
method also comprises a step of curve-fitting a provisional straight line, and in that the 20     predetermined fit range of write power levels is in-between Pfn-©i and Pf,r©2, where Pflt is a<br>
value derived from the provisional curve-fitted straight line. ©1 and ©2 rnay have any value.<br>
However, an especially advantageous fit range is found to be a range of write power levels<br>
in-between 0.85-Pfit and 1.15-Pfif	';<br>
It is noted that the provisional curve-fitted straight line itself can be obtained<br>
25     by curve-fitting it in a fit-range of power levels around a second value of Pflt that is derived from a second provisional curve-fitted straight line. In this way an iteration procedure can be created yielding an optimum fit range of power levels. Such an iteration procedure can start, for example, with a value of Pflt equal to the indicative power level (Pj„d) recorded on the recording medium as control information indicative of the recording process. The iteration<br>
30     procedure can stop, for example, after a predetermined number of iteration steps or,<br>
alternatively, when Pflt changes less then a predetermined value between two consecutive iteration steps. It is also to be noted that when an iteration procedure is used, Pflt can be derived from the provisional straight line curve-fitted in the previous iteration step only.<br><br>
Alternatively, Pfu can be derived from the provisional straight line curve-fitted in the previous iteration step in combination with at least one provisional straight lines curve-fitted in earlier iteration steps.<br>
A further method according to the invention is characterized in that the<br>
5     method also comprises a step of curve-fitting at least a second straight line in at least a<br>
second predetermined fit range of write power levels, and in that in the fifth step the optimum value of the write parameter is set in dependence on a property of each of the curve-fitted straight lines. The optimum value of the write parameter may, for example, be set to the mean value of the optimum values resulting from each individual curve-fitted straight line.<br>
10     Alternatively, a weighted mean value can be used or a value resulting from an interpolation procedure between the optimum values resulting from each individual curve-fitted straight line. Such an interpolation procedure may be either linear or non-linear. When two straight lines are used, the first fit range of write power levels can, for example, be set to a range around the indicative power level (Pjnd) minus a fixed value while the second fit range is set<br>
15     to a range around the indicative power level (Pj„d) plus the fixed value. The fixed value may be selected, for example, from a range of between 0.25 mW and 1.0 mW.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method according to the opening paragraph which determines an accurate and unambiguous optimum value (Popt) 20     of the write power level (P) of the radiation beam. The optimum value (Popt) of the write<br>
power level (P) is defined as the write power (P) for which the lowest jitter of the read signal from information recorded on the recording medium is obtained.<br>
This object is achieved when the method set forth in the preamble, the 25     radiation beam having a write power level, is characterized in that the curve-fitted function is of the form<br>
P-M = a-(P-p), wherein a and p have values resulting from the curve-fitting, the optimum value of the write parameter is set to be substantially equal to the value of (3, and the optimal value (Popt) of the 30     write power level (P) of the radiation beam is set to be equal to the optimum value of the write parameter times a multiplication constant (K).<br>
After the optimum value of the write parameter has been determined, i.e. set to be substantially equal to the value of p, an optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P) of the radiation beam is obtained by multiplying the optimum value of the write parameter by<br><br>
a multiplication constant (K). Thus an optimal value (Popt) of the write power level (P) is found from<br>
Popt = K-P<br>
The value of the multiplication constant (K) depends on properties of the 5     recording medium on which information is to be recorded. It should be noted that the value for the multiplication constant (K) can be derived from the values for the parameter (p) and for the preset value (ytarget) of the known method by the formula<br>
K=p-(1 + 1/Vtarget).<br>
A version of the method according to the invention is characterized in that the<br>
10     multiplication constant (K) is read from an area on the recording medium containing control information indicative of a recording process whereby information can be recorded on said recording medium.<br>
Because the value of the multiplication constant (K) depends solely on properties of the recording medium, it can be determined by the manufacturer and pre-<br>
15     recorded on the recording medium during manufacture. Alternatively, the value of the multiplication constant (K) can be determined by the user and recorded on the recording medium for later use. According to the method the value of the multiplication constant (K) is than read from the recording medium when an optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P) has to be set for recording information on that recording medium.<br>
20<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a apparatus according to the opening paragraph which determines an accurate and unambiguous optimum value for a write parameter wherefrom an optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P) can be derived.<br>
25<br>
This object is achieved when the apparatus set forth in the preamble is characterized in that the apparatus further comprises second means for curve-fitting a function defining a relation between the read parameter and the write power level (P) to the values of the read parameter and of the write power level (P), and third means for setting an<br>
3 0     optimum value of a write parameter in dependence on a property of the curve-fitted function. An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the second means are arranged for curve-fitting a function represented by a substantially straight line to the values of the read parameter and of the write power level (P).<br><br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in<br>
that the read parameter is a modulation (M) of the amplitude of a read signal derived from<br>
information recorded on the recording medium, and in that the curve-fitted function is of the<br>
form	j<br>
5	P-M = a-(P-p),	■    •<br>
wherein a and p have values resulting from the curve-fitting. In a preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, the optimum value of the write parameter is subsequently set to be substantially equal to the value of p.<br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in<br>
10     that the second means (101) for curve-fitting a function are arranged for setting a predetermined fit range of power levels. The predetermined fit range may be set in dependence on a value (Pj„d) indicative of the fit range read from an area on the recording medium comprising control information indicative of the recording process, for example, a range of between GOpPjnd and cc^-Pind where ©i and ©2 are predetermined values. An especially<br>
15     advantageous fit range is found to be a range of write power levels between 0.85-Pjnd and<br>
1.15-Pind.<br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the apparatus comprises fourth means for curve-fitting a provisional straight line to the values of the read parameter and of the write power level (?) arid fifth means for setting a<br>
20      value Pfit in dependence on a property of the curve-fitted provisional straight line, and in that the second means (101) are arranged for setting the predetermined fit range of power levels between Pflt times coi and Pflt times ©2 where cc»i and ©2 are predetermined values. It is to be noted that the provisional curve-fitted straight line itsehScan be obtained from curve-fitting it in a fit range of power levels around a second value of Pf,t derived from a second provisional<br>
25     curve-fitted straight line. In this way an iteration procedure can be created which results in an optimum fit range of power levels. It is also to be noted that the second means for curve-fitting the straight line and the fourth means for curve-fitting the provisional straight line may be separate devices or, alternatively, may be combined into a single device.<br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in<br>
30     that the apparatus comprises fourth means for curve-fitting a second straight line in a second predetermined fit range of power levels, and in that the third means (102) are arranged for setting an optimum value of the write parameter in dependence on a property of each of the curve-fitted straight lines. Again, the second means for curve-fitting the straight line and the<br><br>
fourth means for curve-fitting the second straight line may be separate devices or, alternatively, may be combined into a single device.<br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the apparatus comprises setting means for setting an optimum value (Popt) of the write 5     power level (P) in dependence on the optimum value of the write parameter.<br>
An embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention wherein the read unit is operative to read a value of a multiplication constant (K) from an area on the recording medium containing control information indicative of a recording process whereby information can be recorded on said recording medium is characterized in that the setting 10     means are arranged for setting an optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P) by multiplying the optimum value of a write parameter by the multiplication constant (K).<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an optical recording<br>
medium for use by the method and the optical recording apparatus of the present invention.<br>
15<br>
This object is achieved when the optical recording medium set forth in of the<br>
. preamble is characterized in that the control information comprises a value of a multiplication constant (K).<br>
Because the value of the multiplication constant (K), used by the method and 20     the apparatus for setting the optimum value (Popt) of the write power level (P), depends solely on properties of the recording medium, it can be determined by the manufacturer and prerecorded on the recording medium during manufacture.<br>
It should be noted that an optical recording medium is known from the International patent application No. WO 98/25266. However, the control information 25     contained on this known recording medium comprises a preset value (y target) which, in the known method and apparatus for setting an optimum value for a write parameter, is compared with the values of the normalized derivative (y) of the modulation (M) versus the write power (P). The optical recording medium according to the present invention comprises a multiplication constant (K) which is used to obtain an optimum value (Popt) of the write 30     power level (P) by multiplying this multiplication constant (K) by the optimum value of a write parameter. Furthermore, this optimum value of a write parameter is derived without using a derivative of the modulation (M) versus the write power (P).<br>
This object is also achieved when the optical recording medium of the preamble is characterized in that the control information comprises a value indicative of the<br><br>
fit range (Pjnd). Pind can be determined by the manufacturer and pre-recorded on the recording medium during manufacture. For determining Pj„d, media manufacturers have to find the optimum value (PREF) of the write power level (P) for their recording medium in a reference recording apparatus and under standardized conditions. Now Pj„d can be derived, for 5     example, from PREF from either of the formulas<br><br>
The objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the 10     following more specific descriptions of examples of embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings where:<br>

Figure 1 shows an optical recording apparatus and an optical recording medium 1 according to the invention. The recording medium 1 has a transparent substrate 2 and a recording layer 3 arranged on it. The recording layer 3 comprises a material suitable for recording information by means of a radiation beam 5. The recording material may be of, for 3 0     example, the magneto-optical type, the phase-change type, the dye type or any other suitable material. Information may be recorded in the form of optically detectable regions, also called marks, on the recording layer 3. The apparatus comprises a radiation source 4, for example a semiconductor laser, for emitting a radiation beam 5. The radiation beam is converged on the recording layer 3 via a beam splitter 6, an objective lens 7 and the substrate 2. The recording<br><br>
medium may alternatively be air-incident, the radiation beam then being directly incident on recording layer 3 without passing through a substrate. Radiation reflected from the medium 1 is converged by the objective lens 7 and, after passing through the beam splitter 6, falls on a detection system 8 which converts the incident radiation in the electric detector signals. The<br>
5     detector signals are applied to a circuit 9. The circuit 9 derives several signals from the detector signals, such as a read signal SR representing the information being read from the recording medium 1. The radiation source 4, the beam splitter 6, the objective lens 7, the detection system 8 and circuit 9 together form a read unit 90.<br>
The read signal from the circuit 9 is processed in a first processor 10 in order<br>
10     to derive signals representing a read parameter from the read signal. The derived signals are fed to a second processor 101 and subsequently to a third processor 102 which processors process a series of values of the read parameter and derive therefrom a value for a write power control signal necessary for controlling the laser power level.<br>
The write power control signal is applied to a control unit 12. An information<br>
15     signal 13, representing the information to be recorded on the recording medium 1, is also fed to the control unit 12. The output of the control unit 12 is connected to the radiation source 4. A mark on the recording layer 3 can be recorded by a single radiation pulse, the power of which is determined by the optimum write power level (Popt) as determined by the processor 102. Alternatively, a mark can also be recorded by a series of radiation pulses of equal or<br>
20     different length and one or more power levels determined by the write power signal. A processor is understood to mean any means suitable for performing calculations, for example a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, a hard-wired analog circuit or a field programmable circuit. Moreover, the first processor 10, the second processor 101 and third the processor 102 may be separate devices or, alternatively, may be combined<br>
25     into a single device executing all three processes.<br>
Before recording information on the medium 1 the apparatus sets its write power (P) to the optimum value (Popt) by performing a method according to the invention. This method is schematically depicted in the flow-chart shown in figure 4.<br>
In a first step 41 the apparatus writes a series of test patterns on the medium 1.<br>
30     The test patterns should be selected so as to give a desired read signal. If the read parameter to be derived from the read signal is the modulation (M) of a read signal portion pertaining to a test pattern, the test pattern should comprise marks sufficiently long to achieve a maximum modulation of the read signal portion. When the information is coded according to the so-called Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM), the test patterns preferably comprise the long<br><br>
II1 marks of the modulation scheme. When the information is coded according to the Eight-to-Fourteen Plus Modulation (EFM+), the test patterns should comprise the long 114 marks of this modulation scheme. Each test pattern is recorded with a different write power level (P). The range of powers can be selected on the basis of an indicative power level (Pjnd) recorded 5     as control information on the recording medium. Subsequent test patterns may be recorded with a step-wise increased write power level (?) under the control of the control unit 12. The test patterns may be written anywhere on the recording medium. They can alternatively be written in specially provided test areas on the recording medium.<br>
In a second step 42 the recorded test patterns are read by the read unit 90 so as<br>
10     to form a read signal SR. Figure 2 shows the read signal portions 18 and 19 obtained from two test patterns written at two different write power levels. The patterns shown comprise a short mark, a long mark and a short mark, as denoted by the signal parts 15,16 and 17, respectively, in both the read signal portion 18 and the read signal portion 19. An actual pattern may comprise a few hundred marks of different or equal length.<br>
15	In a third step the 43 processor 10 derives from the read signal SR a read<br>
parameter for each read signal portion. A possible read parameter is the ratio of the lowest level of the amplitude of a read signal portion (for read the signal portion 18 indicated by 'a' in Figure 2) to the maximum level of the amplitude of the same read signal portion (indicated by 'b'). A preferred read parameter is the modulation (M), being the ratio of the maximum<br>
20     peak-to-peak value of a read signal, indicated by 'c', to the maximum amplitude 'b' of the read signal portion.<br>
In a fourth step 44 the processor 101 forms a series of value pairs for the modulation (M) of a pattern times the write power (P) and the write power (P) with which that pattern has been written. The write powers can be taken from the value of the write<br>
25     power control signal during the recording of the test patterns or, alternatively, from a measurement of the radiation power.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically the result of the processed read signal obtained from the test patterns; each dot 21 represents a pair of values for the modulation (M) times the write power (P) and the write power (P) of a test pattern. The processor 101 fits a straight<br>
30     line 22 through the measured modulation values (M) times the write power (P), i.e. M-P. The fitted straight line is represented in Figure 3 by a solid line 22. The fitting may be done by the well known least-squares fitting algorithm. The straight line 22 is curve-fitted to the dots 21 in a predetermined fit range 28 of write power levels. In this example the fit range is centered around a value Pjnd indicative of the fit range read from an area on the recording medium. The<br><br>
fitted straight line 22 may be extrapolated. The extrapolated straight line is represented in Figure 3 by a dashed line 24.<br>
In a fifth step 45 the processor 102 determines an analytic expression describing the fitted straight line. This expression is of the form 5 <br>
where the parameters a and p have values resulting from the curve-fitting. The value for the write parameter (5 determined by the curve fitting is now used by the processor 102 to set the optimum value (Popt) for the write power (P). This is done by multiplying this value for the write parameter (3 by a value of a multiplication constant (K). SO, the optimum value (Popt) for 10     the write power (P) is found from <br>
The multiplication constant (K) depends on properties of the recording medium 1 and may be pre-recorded in a control area 32 of the recording medium 1. If so, the multiplication constant (K) is read from the recording medium 1 by the read unit 90.<br>
15	It should be mentioned that the value for the write parameter p determined by<br>
the curve fitting corresponds to the value of the write power (P) for which the extrapolated straight line 24 crosses the P-axis 26. This value of the write power (P), and hence of the write parameter p, is denoted by jeference number 25 in Figure 3.<br>
An example of a procedure for setting the predetermined fit range 28 of write<br>
20     power levels in an iterative manner is schematically depicted in the flow-chart shown in figure 6. In a step 60, a value Pjnti indicative of the fit range is read from an area on the recording medium 1. In step 611 an initial fit range is set from 0.85 • Pind to 1.15 • PM. In a next step 621, a first provisional straight line is curve-fitted to the dots 21 in the initial fit range. From this first provisional straight line a first fit value Pflt&gt;i is derived in step 631. In a<br>
25     next sequence of the iteration procedure the fit range is set in step 612 from 0.85 • Pfltji to<br>
1.15 • Pf,t_i. In step 622 again a provisional straight line is curve-fitted to the dots 21 and from this second provisional straight line a second fit value Pfit,2 is derived in step 632. Now, in step 44, a straight line 22 is curve fitted to the dots 21 in a predetermined fit range 28 set from 0.85 • P^ to 1.15-Pfitf.<br>
3 0	Each fit value Pf,t, N is derived from the N-th provisional curve-fitted straight<br>
line. A suitable value Pf^N is found from<br><br>
where (3N corresponds to the value of the write power (P) for which the extrapolated N-th provisional straight line crosses the P-axis 26. Moreover, the fit value Pfit, N may be derived not only from the N-th provisional straight line, but also from fit values in earlier steps of the iteration procedure, i.e., 5 <br>
In the above example the iteration procedure consists of three iteration steps. It is to be noted, 10     however that any other number of iteration steps may be used. Moreover, besides using a fixed number of iteration steps, the iteration procedure may, alternatively, continue until a stop criterion is reached. Such a stop criterion is, for example, that Pflt changes less than a predetermined value between two consecutive iteration steps.<br>
Figure 7 shows schematically a flow-chart of a second version of the method 15     according to the invention. Instead of curve fitting a single straight line in the fourth step 44 of the method, two straight lines are curve-fitted. In step 441 a first straight line is curve fitted in a first predetermined fit range and in step 442 a second straight line is curve fitted in a second predetermined fit range. The first fit range is centered around P;nd-0.5mW while the second fit range is centered around Pind+0.5mW. Alternatively, other ranges may be used. 20     The first curve-fitted straight line is described by the expression P-M = ar(P-Pi), while the second curve-fitted straight line is described by the expression P-M = CC2-(P-P2)-In the fifth step 45 of the method, the optimum value (Popt) for the write power is dependent on both Pi and 02- For example, Poptmay be derived from the mean value of pi and P2, i.e.,<br><br>
25     Alternatively, Popt may be derived from a linear interpolation between p 1 and P2 while taking account the respective fit ranges.<br>
Figure 5 a shows an embodiment of recording medium 1 provided with a track 30. The track may have a circular or spiral shape and in the form of, for example, an embossed groove or ridge. The area of the recording medium is divided in an information<br>
30     recording area 31 for recording user information and a control area 32 for storing information relevant for writing, reading and erasing information on the recording medium and in general not intended for recording user information. The control area 32 is marked by a dashed track in figure 5. The information recording area 31 is of a type which is subject to change as<br><br>
regards an optically detectable property when exposed to radiation beyond a specific write power level. Information on the recording medium is represented by patterns of marks.<br>
Information is recorded in a track 30 in the information recording area 31 by a recording process in which each mark is formed by one ore more recording pulses of constant<br>
5     or varying write power in dependence, for example, the length of the marks to be recorded. The recording parameters for this recording process are stored in the control area 32 in the form of patterns of marks 34 representing the control information indicative of the recording process. Figure 5b shows a strongly enlarged portion 33 of the track 30 comprising an example of a pattern of marks 34 in which the control information is encoded.<br>
10	The value of the multiplication constant K and the value indicative of the fit<br>
range PjnC| are stored as patterns of marks representing control information in the control area 32 of the recording medium 1. When the control area 32 is embossed, the manufacturer of the medium must pre-record the values for K and Pjnd during manufacture. Alternatively, the user can record the value for K on the recording medium during, for example, initialization of the<br>
15     recording medium.<br>
Alternatively, a recording medium provided with control information in a different manner may be used. Such an alternative recording medium is, for example a recording medium having the control information indicative of the recording process encoded in a periodic modulation of an embossed groove (known as a wobble). Now the<br>
20     values for the multiplication constant K and for the value indicative of the fit range Pjnd are coded in an auxiliary signal which is used, for example, to frequency-modulate the wobble. A description of such a recording medium may be found in EP 0 397 238.<br>
It should be noted that the above mentioned versions and embodiments illustrate rather than limit de invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design<br>
25     alternatives without departing from the scope of the appended claims. For example, the<br>
invention has been explained by on the basis of embodiment using the read signal modulation (M) as read parameter and a disc shaped recording medium. However, it will be clear to a person skilled in the art that alternative other read parameters and other shapes of the recording medium can be employed. The jitter of the read signal can, for example,<br>
30     alternatively be used as a read parameter. Moreover, in any reference sign placed between parentheses in the claims shall not be construed as limiting the claim. The word "comprise" and its conjugations do not exclude the presence of steps or elements other than those listed in the claims.<br><br><br><br>
