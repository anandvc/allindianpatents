A  PROCESS  FOR  PURIFICATION  OF  A  BACTERIAL  CYTOLYSIN<br>
PURIFICATION PRQCCOS-<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of bacterial cytolysin purification and particularly<br>
to a method of purification of pneumotysin. Pneumolysin is a protein from Streptoco_ccus<br>
pneumoniae with good antigenic properties which is suitable a vaccine component against<br>
S. pneumoniae infection or otitis media. The method of the invention describes an unusual<br>
and advantageous step of purifying pneumolysin in a single chromatographic step by<br>
binding it to a hydrophoblc interaction column In the presence of detergent and high salt.<br>
.— -.. .	■<br>
The process advantageously makes use of the property of bacterial cytolysins of having a <br>
high affinity for aromatic compounds resembling cholesterol, particularly when in an<br>
aggregated condition and hence will be generally applicable for the purification of<br>
members of this family of toxins.<br>
Thiol activated cytolysins form a prominent group of bacterial toxins of which steptolysin O<br>
is the prototype (Billington et al FEMS Microbiol. Lett. (2000) ,1S2; 197-205). These<br>
toxins are lytic for eukaryotic cells by the formation of pores in the cell membrane.<br>
Oxidising agents adversely affect their cytolytic activity whereas reducing agents can<br>
restore activity. Members of this group show 30-60% similarity in primary amino acid<br>
sequence and contain an almost invariant undecapeptide sequence near the C-terminus.<br>
Cholesterol is the major target cell receptor for these toxins. The ^cytolysins bind to<br>
cholesterol containing membranes and oligomerise to form transmembrane pores up to<br>
30nm in dFameter and composed of 40-80 monomer subunits. The binding of membrane<br>
cholesterol induces a conformational change in the toxin monomer driving the subsequent<br>
events of oligimerisation, membrane insertion and pore formation.<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the causative agent of several human diseases including<br>
pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Sometimes these diseases<br>
can lead to fatalities despite the availability of antibiotics. The emergence of antibiotic<br>
resistant strains of S. pneumoniae has aggravated the problems caused by this pathogen.<br>
In this context, it is important for effective vaccines against S. pneumoniae to be<br>
developed.<br>
Polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines containing purified capsular polysaccharides have<br>
been available for several years. Their application is limited by poor immunogenicity<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
particularly in high-risk groups including infants, the elderly and those with sickle-cell<br>
anaemia, multiple myeloma, cirrhosis or alcoholism. They also provide serotype specific<br>
protection and only 23 out of 90 known serotypes are covered by existing formulations.<br>
This will give protection against 90% of serotypes found in the US population but against<br>
only approximately 70% of serotypes found in Asian populations. Recently a conjugated<br>
seven-valent vaccine has become available, which similarly has problems protecting<br>
against all pneumococcal strains.<br>
Pneumolysin (Ply) is a 53kDa thiol-activated cytolysin found in all strains of S.<br>
pneumoniae, which is released on autolysis and contributes to the pathogenesis of S.<br>
pneumonias. It is highly conserved with only a few amino add substitutions occurring<br>
between the Ply proteins of different serotypes. Pneumolysin's high degree of<br>
conservation and its immunogenicity make it a potential candidate as a vaccine<br>
component. However, wild-type Ply is unsuitable for incorporation into vaccines for use in<br>
humans because of its toxicity. Ply causes damage to cell membranes by interacting with<br>
membrane-bound cholesterol and oligomerising to form pores in the membrane. A<br>
conserved cysteine-containing motif found near the C-terminus has been implicated in the<br>
lytic activity. Mutations of Ply have been suggested to lower this toxicity (WO90/06951,<br>
WO99/03884).<br>
A two step method for the purification of pneumolysin has been described by Lock et al<br>
(Microbial Pathogenesis (1996) 21; 71-83). Recombinant pneumolysin is purified from an<br>
E. coli culture using a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The<br>
method involves the steps of preparing an extract and passing it down a DEAE-<br>
Sepharose column followed by a Sephacryl S200-HR column. This method could be used<br>
to purify recombinant or native pneumolysin.<br>
Kuo et al describe a method of purifying recombinant GST-pneumolysIn fusion protein<br>
(Infection and Immunity (1995) 63; 2706-2713). The fusion protein is expressed in an E.<br>
 coli culture and a cell lysate is loaded onto a glutathione agarose gel. The fusion protein is<br>
eluted with glutathione and thrombin can be used to cleave the fusion protein. The<br>
proteins were passed over a glutathione-agarose column again to remove GST. The<br>
affinity purified pneumolysin was further purified using a hydroxylapatite column.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
Mitchell et al (BBA (1989) 1007; 67-72) describe a method of purifying pneumolysin using<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Under the conditions that they use (250mM<br>
salt), the pneumolysin failed to bind tightly to the column although its progress was<br>
retarded and the pneumolysin eluted as a broad peak. Additional steps of determining<br>
which fractions contained pure pneumolysin, concentrating the positive fractions,<br>
reloading onto the column and eluting with a small volume of water were needed to<br>
overcome the problem of the pneumolysin not binding tightly to the column material.<br>
There remains a continuing need for improved vaccines against S. pneumoniae. The<br>
incorporation of a Ply component has promise although the toxicity of the protein remains<br>
a problem. The development of a rapid and effective procedure for the bulk purification of<br>
pneumolysin is also required. Methods described previously involve the use of multiple<br>
purification steps with intervening assay and concentration steps. The present invention<br>
provides a more efficient purification method which advantageously uses a single<br>
chromatography step, which is capable of being used to purify large batches of<br>
pneumolysin.<br>

Processes<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
The process of the invention is a method for purifying a bacterial cytolysin such as<br>
pneumoiysin. A cytolysin, for instance pneumolysin, is purified using only a single column   <br>
chromatography step without requiring reloading onto the column. The protein is bound in  <br>
an aggregated form to a hydrophobic interaction column In the presence of detergent and    <br>
salt. Few proteins bind to the column under these conditions allowing purification of a<br>
cytolysin in a single step.<br>
For the purposes of the invention a soluble aggregate of a cytolysin, preferably<br>
pneumolysin is an aggregated form of the cytolysin that remains in the supernatant after<br>
centrifugation at 30,000g for 20 minutes. The soluble aggregate is retained on<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography material, preferably phenyl-Sepharose, in the<br>
presence of high salt, preferably 1M. Optionally, the soluble aggregate is colloidal.<br>
The cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin is bound to the column as a soluble aggregate. It is<br>
unusual to load aggregates onto a column for various reasons including filters or columns<br>
clogging and loss of material. However, by using a detergent that reduces the size of the<br>
aggregates to form a soluble aggregate, it is found that these aggregates bind tightly to<br>
the column under detergent conditions but may be eluted at a purity of at least 50%, 60%,<br>
70%, 80%, preferably 90%, 95%, more preferably 97%, 98% or 99% as assessed by<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis without adversely affecting the column filters. The process preferably<br>
gives a yield of at least 100, 200, 500, 7Q0, more preferably 1000, 1500, 1700 or 19Q0mg<br>
of cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin per litre of fermentation. Preferably at least 1%, 2%,<br>
5%, 7%, 9% or 10% of the protein from the fermentation culture is recovered as purified<br>
cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin.<br>
The process exploits the ability of cytolysins such as pneumolysin to bind to cholesterol<br>
and other aromatic compounds. This binding is particularly tight when the cytolysin is<br>
aggregated, allowing the cytolysin to bind in the presence of detergent. The process can<br>
be extended to other members of the cytolysin family since all members share the ability<br>
to bind to aromatic compounds and form pores. In fact the method could be used to purify<br>
other families of protein that bind to cholesterol or other aromatic compounds and/or form<br>
pores, preferably both.<br>

WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
Accordingly, in a first embodiment, a process for bacterial cytolysin purification is provided<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	growing a culture of celts expressing bacterial cytolysin;<br>
b)	preparing an extract from the culture containing bacterial cytolysin;<br>
c)	binding soluble aggregated bacterial cytolysin contained in the extract in the<br>
presence of detergent (preferably aliphatic detergent) to a hydrophobtc interaction<br>
chromatography material under high salt (preferably 0.5-2M salt) conditions;<br>
d)	eluting bacterial cytolysin in the presence of detergent (preferably aliphatic<br>
detergent) under low salt (preferably 0-0.2M salt) conditions.<br>
In a second embodiment a process for bacteria! cytolysin purification is provided<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	growing a culture of cells expressing bacterial cytolysin;<br>
b)	preparing an extract from the culture containing bacterial cytolysin;<br><br>
c)	binding   bacterial  cytolysin  contained  in  the  extract to  hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography material in the presence of a solution containing 0.5-2M salt and 0.1%-<br>
5% detergent;<br>
d)	eluting bacterial cytolysin using a low salt (preferably 0-0.2M salt) solution containing<br>
0.1-5% detergent.<br>
In either of the above embodiments, the process of the invention preferably comprises the<br>
further steps of;<br>
e)	removing detergent from the bacterial cytolysin<br>
f)	solubilising the bacterial cytolysin by addition of a denaturant;<br>
g)	removing the denaturant from the bacterial cytolysin.<br>
The process of the invention can be advantageously used to purify pneumococcal<br>
pneumolysin. Other cytolysins that can be purified by the method of the invention include<br>
pyolysin from A. pyogenes, cereolysin from S. cereus, thuringiolysin O from B.<br>
 thuringiensis, laterosporolysin from 8. latersporus, bifermentolysin from C. bifermentans,<br>
botukinolysin from C. botulinum, chauveolysin from C. chauvoel, histolyticolysin from C.<br>
histolyticum, oedematolysin from C. novyi type A, perfringolysin O from C. perfringens,<br>
septicolysin O from C. septicum, sordellilysin from C. sordellii, tetanoiysin from C. tetani,<br>
ivanolysin O from L ivanovi, listeriolysin O from L monocytogenes, seeligerilysin O from<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/CP2004/002641<br>
L seeligeri, alveolysin from P. alvei, streptolysin 0 from S. pyogenes, S. canis or S.<br>
equisimilis, intermedilysin from S. intermedius, suilysln from S. suls or pneumolysin from<br>
S. pneumoniae which may be of wild type or may be a genetically modified toxins with<br>
lower levels of toxlcity such as PdA and PdB described above.<br>
By pneumolysin or Ply it is meant: native pneumolysin from pneumococcus or<br>
recombinant pneumolysin, wild-type pneumolysin or mutants of pneumolysin (e.g. those<br>
described in WO90/06951 and WO99/03884). Optionally, pneumolysin can also mean any<br>
fragment of pneumolysin or any variant of pneumolysin which shares at least 70, 80, 90 or<br>
95% amino acid sequence identity with a wild-type pneumolysin sequence, which still<br>
retains the ability to be purified by the methods of the invention, as easily determined by a<br>
skilled person.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the same detergent is present in steps b) and<br>
c), b) and d), c) and d), more preferably in steps b), c) and d), preferably at a<br>
concentration of 0.1%-5% (w/v). For the purposes of the invention, an aliphatic detergent<br>
is defined as a substantially aliphatic detergent with insufficient aromatic character to<br>
prevent binding of cytolysin to the column in step c). Preferably, the detergent will have<br>
one or less aromatic rings, most preferably it has no aromatic rings. During step b), it is<br>
advantageous for the detergent to break up larger aggregates of cytolysin into smaller<br>
aggregates which make a soluble aggregate. During steps c) and d) , the detergent<br>
advantageously retains the soluble aggregated state of the cytolysin, allowing it to bind to<br>
the column in high salt conditions with high affinity.<br>
 The cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin is expressed in a culture of bacterial cells,<br>
preferably S. pneumonias, E. coli or alternatively in yeast cells, insect cells, mammalian<br>
cells or any other expression system suitable for its expression. In expression systems<br>
that produce high yields of pneumolysin, the pneumolysin often becomes aggregated of<br>
its own accord and the process of the invention is ideal for its purification. Preferably<br>
 pneumolysin is expressed at high yields so that it makes up more than 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 or 10%<br>
of total protein in the expression system. Preferably the pneumolysin is in aggregated<br>
form and hence mostly devoid of haemolytic activity. For example, expression in E.coli in<br>
a fermentor under a phage X promoter or other promoters that allow high expression are<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
Preferably, the cytolysin is extracted from the expression system as an aggregate.<br>
Alternatively, a lower yield expression system may provide soluble cytolysin. In this case,<br>
the extract containing cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin is adjusted to a pH below 7.5<br>
which allows the cytolysin to aggregate over a period of at least 8 hours, preferably at<br>
least 24 hours.<br>
The preparation of an extract in step b) preferably involves one or more steps of<br>
mechanically breaking the cells and/or treating the cells with detergent. If made with a<br>
high yield method, the pneumolysin remains in the form of aggregates but the aggregates<br>
should be small enough so that they remain in the supernatant after centrifugation of the<br>
sample under conditions necessary for pelleting insoluble cellular debris. Preferably the<br>
detergent used in the invention is an aliphatic detergent which does not contain aromatic<br>
rings, preferably an ionic detergent, more preferably a cationic or anionic detergent and<br>
most preferably, the detergent is sodium lauroly sarcosinate. Preferred detergents are<br>
able to solubilise pneumolysin whilst leaving it in the form of small aggregates that bind to<br>
the hydrophoblc interaction column without causing blockage of filters attached to the<br>
column. Preferred detergents are able to reduce the size of pneumolysin aggregates,<br>
allowing the pneumolysin aggregates to be sufficiently small so that they remain in the<br>
supernatant after centrifugation of the sample at 30,000g for 20 minutes. Such soluble<br>
aggregates are puriflable as such on the hydrophobic interaction column. The detergent is<br>
present at a concentration of between 0.1% and 5%, preferably 0.5% and 3% (w/v),<br>
preferably between 0.75% and 2%, more preferably around 1%. Preferably, the detergent<br>
is dialysable.<br>
Following mechanical and/or detergent disruption of the culture in step b), the process of<br>
the invention includes centrifugation of the cell material and collecting the supernatant as<br>
the extract to be loaded onto the chromatography material during step c). Pneumolysin is<br>
preferably present in the supernatant as a soluble aggregate.<br>
The process of the invention uses hydrophobic interaction chromatography to purify<br>
pneumolysin in a single step. The column material used in step c) preferably contains<br>
aromatic groups, preferably phenyl groups and more preferably is phenyl-sepharose.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
The solution used in step c) and/or step d) during loading and elution of the column<br>
comprises an ionic detergent preferably a cationic or anionic detergent, preferably a<br>
detergent which Is soluble at salt concentrations above 0.5M, most preferably the<br>
detergent is sodium lauroly sarcosinate. The detergent used is one which will reduce the<br>
size of cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin, aggregates, allowing the cytolysin to be present<br>
in the sample as a soluble aggregate so that it will bind to the hydrophobic interaction<br>
column material without being irreversibly stuck on the column. The detergent is present<br>
at a concentration of preferably between 0.1% and 5%, preferably 0.5% and 3% (w/v),<br>
more preferably between 0.75% and 2%, most preferably around 1%.<br>
The solution used in step c) and/or d) contains a salt, preferably a salt selected from the<br>
group consisting of sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium<br>
sulphate, magnesium sulphate, ammonium sulphate, sodium phosphate, magnesium<br>
phosphate, ammonium phosphate and is preferably buffered at pH 6-^, preferably around<br>
pH 7. Any buffer capable of maintaining the pH between pH 5 and 9 may be used.<br>
The solution used to bind pneumolysin to the column in the process of the invention<br>
contains a high salt concentration, preferably 0.6 - 2M, more preferably around 1M. The<br>
salt concentration is chosen such that pneumolysin is in a soluble aggregated form and is<br>
capable of binding to the hydrophobic chromatography material.<br>
Optionally, step c) can contain an extra step of washing the column in intermediate salt<br>
conditions of around 0.5M salt or a salt concentration capable of removing any poorly<br>
binding impurities.<br>
The process of the invention uses a decreasing salt gradient to elute pneumolysin from<br>
the column. Preferably the low salt solution used to make the salt gradient in step d)<br>
contains between 0 - 0.1M salt, more preferably 0-40mM salt. Alternatively, step wise<br>
elution may be used with the low salt buffer used in step d) containing between 0 - 0.2M<br>
     salt, more preferably 0-40mM salt.<br>
Optional steps may be added to the process of the invention if it is preferred to denature<br>
the pneumolysin and subsequently refold it by removal of the denaturant. These optional<br>
steps ensure that pure cytoiysin, preferably pneumolysin, with a native structure is<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
obtained. The first optional step e) involves the removal of detergent by diafiltration,<br>
dialysis or dilution. This step preferably involves diafiltration/dialysis against a buffer of pH<br>
8-10, preferably around 9, more preferably the buffer is one able to buffer at alkaline pH<br>
values, most preferably the buffer is DEA. The solution is preferably of low ionic strength,<br>
preferably 10-50mM, most preferably around 25 mM. Diafiltration or dialysis is preferably<br>
carried out at 4°C but is alternatively carried out at room temperature.<br>
In a second optional step, cytolysin, preferably pneumoiysin is denatured and solubilised<br>
by addition of a denaturant. Preferably the denaturant used in step f) is guanidine<br>
hydrochloride, more preferably 5-8M guanidine hydrochloride, most preferably around 6M<br>
guanidine hydrochloride. The pneumoiysin is incubated with guanidine hydrochloride for at<br>
least 10 minutes, preferably for at least 1 hour, more preferably for about one hour.<br>
The cytolysin, preferably pneumoiysin is preferably then contacted with 5-9M urea,<br>
preferably around 8M urea during step f). This is achieved by diafiltration or dialysis of the<br>
cytolysin, preferably pneumoiysin against urea. Preferably, the same buffer and pH are<br>
maintained during the exchange of denaturant. Preferably, a reducing agent (DTT, 2-<br>
mercaptoethanol or glutathione is added during the exchange of denaturant.<br>
Preferably step f) involves contacting cytolysin, preferably pneumoiysin with 5-8M<br>
guanidine hydrochloride followed by exchanging the guanidine hydrochloride fot_5-9M<br>
urea.<br>
In order to prevent inappropriate disulphide bonds forming while the cytolysin, preferably<br>
pneumoiysin is denatured, it is advantageous to ensure that a reducing agent is present<br>
during at least part of steps f) and g). A preferred reducing agent is 0.1-10mM DTT,<br>
preferably around 1mM DTT. Alternatively glutathione or 2-mercaptoethanol is used.<br>
Preferred concentration of glutathione are 1-50 mM, more preferably 10-30mM.<br>
Optional step g) involves removal of the denaturant in order to refold cytolysin, preferably<br>
pneumoiysin, preferably by diafiltration or dialysis against a low salt buffer of'pH 6-11,<br>
preferably around pH 9. Preferably cytolysin, preferably pneumoiysin concentration is<br>
maintained at at least 1G0ug/ml, preferably between 100 ug/ml and 1000ug/ml, more<br>
preferably at around 500ug/ml. Optionally, diafiltration or dialysis Is against a buffer<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
containing propylene glycol at between 10 and 30%, preferably at around 15%. Preferably<br>
a reducing agent as described above is maintained during step g). Diafiltration or dialysis<br>
is preferably carried out at 4°C but is alternatively carried out at room temperature.<br>
A further optional step h) involves the removal of the reducing agent after cytolysin,<br>
preferably pneumolysin has refolded. This is preferably achieved by diafiltration or dialysis<br>
against a low salt buffer of pH 6-11, preferably around pH 9. Optionally, diafiltration or<br>
dialysis is against a buffer containing propylene glycol at between 10 and 30%, preferably<br>
at around 15%. Diafiltration or dialysis is preferably carried out at 4°C but is alternatively<br>
carried out at room temperature.<br>
In preferred methods of the invention, the cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin is refolded so<br>
that Its haemolytic activity is restored to above 25%, 50%, 75% most preferably to above<br>
90% of that of the properly folded protein. For the purposes of the invention, 'folded'<br>
protein is a protein having the tertiary structure of the protein made by a non-denaturing<br>
process. In the case of wild type pneumolysin, the expected haemotytic activity of refolded<br>
pneumolysin would be 500,000-1,000,000 haemolytic units/mg pneumolysin. In the case<br>
of point mutated pneumolysin with a lower haemolytic activity, the haemolytic activity of<br>
the refolded pneumolysin would be correspondingly lower.<br>
Detoxification of a toxin<br>
The cytolysin purified by the method of the invention, preferably pneumolysin may be<br>
subjected to a further optional step of detoxification by chemical treatment. This additional<br>
step is particularly advantageous if the cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin is to be<br>
administered to an animal or a human. Wild type pneumolysin is highly toxic. Several<br>
mutated pneumolysin proteins have been isolated that have reduced toxicity, yet these<br>
still retain residual toxicity that may be problematic when the pneumolysin is administered<br>
internally (WO99/03884, WO90/06951). Alternatively it can be detoxified by conjugation to<br>
polysaccharides (WO96/05859).<br>
The process of the invention may detoxify either wild type or mutated cytolysin, for<br>
example pneumolysin by chemical treatment. Preferred embodiments use a crosslinking<br>
agent, more preferably containing one or more chemicals selected from the group<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT7EP2004/002641<br>
consisting of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and a cross-linking reagent containing an N-<br>
hydroxysuccinomido ester and/or a maleimlde group (e.g. GMBS).<br>
The detoxification processes themselves are an aspect of the invention and can be used<br>
to detoxify bacterial toxins, preferably pneumolysin prepared by other methods.<br>
In one embodiment, the detoxification method of the invention describes the detoxification<br>
of a bacterial toxin comprising treating the toxin with a chemical compound, preferably a<br>
crosstinking reagent that is reactive, preferably preferentially reactive, most preferably<br>
specifically reactive with amine groups, more preferably primary amine groups.<br>
For the purposes of this application, a cross linking reagent is defined as a compound with<br>
at least two reactive groups, at least one of which is capable of reacting with at least one<br>
group on the bacterial toxin. A further reactive group Is able to react with either a group on<br>
the bacterial toxin or a separate compound (for instance an amino acid, peptide,<br>
polypeptide, sugar or polysaccharide).<br>
Preferably, the chemical compound or the crosslinking reagent is reactive, more<br>
preferably preferentially reactive, most preferably specifically reactive with amine and<br>
sulfhydryl groups. Preferably, the chemical compound reacts with a primary amine group<br>
of lysine, more preferably, the crosslinking reagent reacts with a primary amine group of<br>
lysine and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine. This method is particularly advantageous<br>
where pneumolysin is detoxified since modification of both cysteine and lysine residues<br>
leads to a synergistic decrease in the level of hemolysis compared to the residual<br>
     hemolysis activity where the cross-linking reagent reacts with only lysine or cysteine.<br>
Thus an alternative embodiment provides a method of detoxifying bacterial toxins<br>
comprising modifying a cysteine residue (optionally near the C-terminus of the toxin)<br>
involved in the toxic activity of the toxin (preferably the lytic activity) comprising treating<br>
 the toxin with a cross-linking reagent (preferably a heterobifunctional cross-linking<br>
reagent) that cross-links the sulfhydryi groups with another amino acid of the toxin,<br>
preferably more than 2, 5,10, 15, 20, 30. 40 amino acids away from the cysteine in the<br>
primary structure. Preferably the other amino acid contains a primary amine group and<br>
more preferably the amino acid is lysine.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
In some embodiments, over 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% of the toxin retains a<br>
molecular weight within 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%, more<br>
preferably between 1-50%, most preferably between 5-10% of its original molecular<br>
weight after the treatment as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Preferably the toxin acquires a<br>
slightly higher molecular weight following the detoxification treatment due to several ami no<br>
acid residues becoming modified by covalently binding to the chemical compound.<br>
However the method of the invention preferably does not involve extensive conjugation of<br>
the toxin, either by covalently binding it to other toxin molecules so that a toxin with a<br>
multimeric quaternary structure is formed, or by covalently binding the toxin to other large<br>
proteins, polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides. Most preferably the methods, proteins<br>
or products disclosed in WO96/05859 are not covered by this invention.<br>
The methods of the invention may be used to detoxify bacterial toxins. Preferred toxins<br>
include the thiol-activated cytolysins pyolysin from A. pyogenes, cereoiysin from B.<br>
census, thuringiolysin O from B. thuringiensis, laterosporolysin from B. latersporus,<br>
bifermentolysin from C. bifermentans, botukinolysin from C. botulinum, chauveoiysin from<br>
C. chauvoet, histolyticolysin from C. histolyticum, oedematolysin from C. novyi type A,<br>
perfringolysin O from C, perfringens, septicolysin O from C. septicum, sordellilysin from C.<br>
sordellii, tetanolysin from C. tetani, ivanolysin O from L ivanovi, listeriolysin O from L<br>
monocytogenes, seeligerilysin O from L seeligeht alveolysin from P. alvei, streptolysin O<br>
from S. pyogenes, S. canis or S. equisimilis, intermedilysin from S. intermedius, suilysin<br>
from S. suis or pneumolysin from S. pneumoniae which may be of wild type or may be a<br>
genetically modified toxins with lower levels of toxicity such as PdA and PdB described<br>
above (WO90/06951, WO99/03884).<br>
The method may also be used to detoxify the Neisserial toxins FrpA, FrpC (WO92/01460),<br>
FrpB (Microbiology 142; 3269-3274, (1996); J. Bacteriol. 181; 2895-2901 (1999)) NM-<br>
ADPRT (13th International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference 2002 Masignani et al p135).<br>
 FrpA and FrpC contain a region which is conserved between these two proteins and a<br>
preferred fragment of the toxins would be a polypeptide containing this conserved<br>
fragment, preferably comprising amino acids 227-1004 of the sequence of FrpA/C.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
The method of the invention may also be used to detoxify Bordetella toxins including<br>
adenylate cyclase (CyaA) (Glaser (1988) Mol. Microbiol. 2; 19-30), dermonecrotic toxin<br>
(Livey (1984) J. Med, Microbiol. 17; 91-103) and pertussis toxin (PT) (Munoz et al (1981)<br>
Infect Immun 33; 820-826). The method of the invention is also useful for detoxifying<br>
tetanus toxin (TT) and diphtheria toxin (DT) and toxin from S. aureus and S. epidermidis<br>
including autolysin and haemdysin (WO01/98499, WO02/59148).<br>
Methods of the invention lead to a reduction of the amount of toxicity and/or haemolytic<br>
activity of the toxin of at least 90%, preferably 95%, 96%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9% or<br>
99.99%. (Haemolytic activity is measured using the method of Example 3 and toxicity may<br>
be measured by the method of Example 5.) Native pneumolysin has a haemolytic activity<br>
of 500,000 - 1,000,000 units per mg of pneumoiysin. Some point-mutated variants of<br>
pneumolysin have reduced toxicity and haemolytic activity. Detoxification of a variant<br>
pneumolysin may not be able to achieve as large a percentage decrease in haemolytic<br>
activity due to the lower starting point form which haemolytic activity is reduced, however<br>
it is envisioned that the majority of the remaining haemolytic activity is removed by the.<br>
methods of the invention.<br>
The detoxification step of the method of the invention preferably provides a cross-linking<br>
reaction which is substantially non-reversible. Reversibility is assessed by monitoring the<br>
level of haemolytic activity of the detoxified toxin directly after detoxification and after<br>
incubating at a temperature above 25 °C, preferably above 30 °C, more preferably above<br>
35 °C, most preferably above 37 °C for at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. A substantially<br>
non-reversible reaction results in substantially non-reversible detoxification and is defined<br>
as a reaction where the level of haemolytic activity rises by less than 100%, 50%, 40%,<br>
30%, 20% 10% after incubation at an elevated temperature as described above. Many<br>
methods of detoxification, for instance by using formaldehyde treatment, result in<br>
detoxification that is not stable but increases in toxicity over time.<br>
 In a preferred detoxification step of the method of the invention over 50%, 60%, 70%,<br>
80%, 90%, 95%, or 98% of the toxin retains a monomeric quaternary structure after the<br>
cross-linking reaction. Many cross-linking reagents form intermolecular crosslinks (for<br>
example formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde). This can effect the immunological properties<br>
of the toxin since some epitopes will be hidden within the aggregate. Methods of the<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT7EP2004/002641<br>
invention preferably involve simply modifying amino acid residues, preferably sulfhydryl<br>
and/or primary amine groups of amino acids and/or the formation of mainly intramolecular<br>
crosslinks. The resultant monomeric quaternary structure allows epitopes to remain<br>
exposed on the surface of the toxin.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the detoxification step, the cross-linking reagent is<br>
heterobifunctional. Preferred crosslinking reagents contain an N-hydroxysucdnlmide<br>
ester group that reacts preferentially, more preferably specifically, with primary amine<br>
groups. Preferably the cross-linking reagent contains a maleimide group that reacts<br>
preferentially, more preferably specifically, with sulfhydryl groups. At a pH around 7, a<br>
maleimide group reacts 1000 fold faster with sulfhydryl groups than it does with amines.<br>
Preferably, the cross-linking reagent contains both an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester group<br>
and a maleimide group. The crosslinking agent is preferably not cleavable using a<br>
reducing agent since this leads to less effective detoxification.<br>
The distance between the reactive groups of the cross-linking reagent is able to effect the<br>
efficiency of detoxification. Preferably, the distance between the groups of the crosslinking<br>
reagent that are reactive with amine and sulfhydryl groups is between 1.5 and 20<br>
Angstroms, more preferably between 5 and 15 Angstroms and most preferably around 10<br>
Angstroms in the method of the invention. Preferably, amino acid residues on the bacterial<br>
toxin are modified by addition of a group that is over 5, 7,10, 12, 15,18, 20, 50,100, 500<br>
Angstroms long. Preferably, the modifying group is between 5 and 100 Angstroms, more<br>
preferably between 10 and 20 Angstroms In size.<br>
The detoxification step of the method of the invention allows sufficient residues to be<br>
modified so that steric interference and/or conformational changes inhibit the function of<br>
the bacterial toxin. Preferably at least 5, 7,10,12,14,15, 20 or 25 amino acid residues of<br>
the bacterial toxin are modified. Where unreacted maleimide groups are present on the<br>
cross-linking reagent, an Ellman reaction can be used to estimate (indirectly) the number<br>
 of crossllnker molecules attached to each molecule of toxin (Ellman 1959 Arch. Biochem.<br>
Biophys. 82; 70).<br>
Preferred crossiinking reagents are SMPT, Surfo-LC-SMPT, Sulfo-KMUS, LC-SMCC,<br>
KMUA, Sulfo-LC-SPDP, LC-SPDP, SMPB, Sulfo-SMPB, SMPH, Sulfo-SMCC, SMCC,<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
SIAB, Sulfo-SiAB, GMBS (N-(y-maleimidobutyrylo)cy)succinirnide ester), Sulfo-GMBS,<br>
MBS, Sulfo-MBS, Sulfo-EMCS, EMCA, EMCS, BMPS, SPDP, SBAP, BMPA, AMAS,<br>
SATP and SIA (Pierce).<br>
In a preferred method of the invention the toxin is treated with the chemical compound or<br>
crosslinking reagent under pH conditions of between 5.0 and 9.0, preferably 6.5 to 8.0,<br>
most preferably 7.0 to 7.8. In treatments where the reaction of a maleimide group to a<br>
sulfhydryl group is encouraged, the preferred pH of the reaction is 6.0 and 8.0, more<br>
preferably 6.5 and 7.5. The preferred concentration of salts during the reaction is between<br>
100mM and 1M, more preferably 150mM and 500mM, most preferably between 200mM<br>
and 300mM. However, the inventors have found that it is sometimes preferable to perform<br>
the reaction at low salt concentration where no sodium chloride or other salt is added.<br>
Where the reaction is performed at a pH of between 7.6 and 7.8, the reaction can<br>
optionally be carried out without the addition of salt. Similarly, the use of higher ratios of<br>
GMBS to toxin can be performed without the addition of salt at pH values between 7.0 and<br>
8.0.<br>
Preferably a 50-500, more preferably 130-350 or 350- 900, most preferably around 250<br>
fold molar excess of the chemical compound or crosslinking reagent to each toxin is used.<br>
Pneumococcal pneumolysin contains 31 lysine residues. Therefore a 248 fold molar<br>
excess of chemical compound or cross-linking reagent over pneumolysin is equivalent to<br>
an 8 fold molar excess of chemical compound or cross-linking reagent to each lysine<br>
residue. Preferably a 2-20, more preferably a 4-15 or 15-30, most preferably around 8 fold<br>
molar ratio of chemical compound or cross-linking reagent to lysine residues is used in<br>
methods of the Invention.<br>
The treatment with crosslinking reagent proceeds for at least 15 minutes, preferably for at<br>
least 30 minutes, most preferably for around one hour at between 4°C and 40 °C,<br>
preferably between 15 °C and 25 °C, most preferably at room temperature. The method of<br>
the invention may further comprise a quenching step using a compound containing a<br>
sulfhydryl group, preferably the quenching compound has a molecular weight of over 50,<br>
100 or 120, more preferably the quenching reagent is an amino add such as cysteine.<br>
Alternatively the groups may be reacted with a peptide or polysaccharide moiety capable<br>
of reacting with maleimide, for instance a peptide containing a cysteine residue. This is<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCTYEP2004/002641<br>
particularly appropriate where unreacted maleimide group are present prior to the<br>
quenching step.<br>
The detoxification step is suitable for use on bacterial toxins as described above.<br>
Preferably the bacterial toxin is from Streptococcus pneumonias, most preferably the toxin<br>
is pneumolysin. The pneumolysln is a native or recombinant protein or a protein that has<br>
been genetically engineered to reduce its toxicity (as described above). Fusion proteins of<br>
toxins, preferably pneumolysin or fragments of toxins, preferably pneumolysin may be<br>
detoxified using the method of the invention.<br>
Thus in a preferred embodiment, a toxin (such as pneumolysin) is detoxified with a cross-<br>
linking reagent which is preferably heterobifunctional having groups that are reactive with<br>
lysine and cysteine residues and is of a certain size, most preferably having the reactive<br>
groups spaced 10-20 Angstroms apart such that either or preferably both or the following<br>
occurs:<br>
a)	between 5 and 30, preferably around 12-14 amino acid residues of the toxin are<br>
modified by a cross-linker molecule covalently binding preferably to a tysine or<br>
arginine residue (preferably, as measured indirectly by an Ellman reaction), the other<br>
end having been quenched (preferably with cysteine) and/or,<br>
b)	a cysteine sidechain involved in the toxic activity of the toxin (preferably towards the<br>
C~terminus of the toxin) is cross-linked to another sidechain of the toxin (preferably to<br>
a lysine or arginine residue) which is preferably separated by more than 2, 5, 10, 20,<br>
30 or 40 amino acids from the cysteine residue in the primary sequence of the toxin.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a toxin (preferably pneumolysin) is detoxified with a<br>
monofunctional chemical compound which preferably reacts with amino acids containing a<br>
primary amine group, more preferably lysine, and is of a certain size, most preferably 10-<br>
100 Angstroms such that the toxin is covered with between 5 and 30, more preferably<br>
around 14 chemical compound bound to amino acid residues.<br>
Polvsaccharide conjugates<br>
A problem associated with the polysaccharide approach to vaccination, is the fact that<br>
polysaccharides per se are poor immunogens.  To overcome this, polysaccharides may<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
be conjugated to protein carriers, which provide bystander T-cell help. The process of the<br>
invention may advantageously contain a further step of conjugating the cytolysin,<br>
preferably pneumolysin to a bacterial polysaccharide, for instance a lipo-oligosaccharide<br>
or preferably a capsular polysaccharide.<br>
A preferred conjugate of the invention comprises cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin<br>
obtained by the method of the invention conjugated to capsular polysaccharides derived<br>
from Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigens<br>
are preferably selected from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 1QA 11A, 12F, 14,<br>
15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F (most preferably from serotypes 1, 3, 4,<br>
5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14,18C, 19F and 23F), or mixtures of two or more of said conjugates (4, 7,<br>
9,11,13or23).<br>
Cytotysin, preferably pneumolysin, purified by the process of the invention is also<br>
preferably conjugated to capsular polysaccharides from other strains of bacteria. Such<br>
polysaccharides can be isolated from, for example, H. influenzae, H. influenzae type B<br>
(Hib), N. meningitidis groups A, C, W, Y, Streptococci other than S. pneumoniae (e.g.,<br>
Group B Streptococcus, S. pyogen&amp;s, etc.), Staphylococcus (e.g., S. aureus, S.<br>
epidermidis), E. coli, Enterococcus (e.g., E. faecalis and £. faecium) ,etc. Preferably the<br>
polysaccharides are from H. influenzae type B (Hib), and/or N. meningitidis groups A, C,<br>
W135, and/or Y.<br>
The polysaccharide may be linked to cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin, by any known<br>
method (for example, by Likhite, U.S. Patent 4,372,945 and by Armor etal., U.S. Patent<br>
 4,474,757). Preferably, CDAP conjugation is carried out (WO 95/08348). To enhance<br>
immunogenicity, the polysaccharides may be adjuvanted and/or lyophilised. The<br>
polysaccharides of the invention may be full size or sized post purification to smaller<br>
polysaccharides or oligosaccharides.<br>
     The process of the invention preferably comprises a further step of formulating cytolysin,<br>
preferably pneumolysin into a vaccine.<br>
Proteins and immunogenic compositions<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is cytoiysin, preferably pneumolysin, purified by the<br>
method of the invention. This includes a pneumolysin-bacterial capsular poiysaccharide<br>
conjugate made by the process of the invention.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is an immunogenic composition comprising<br>
cytoiysin, preferably pneumolysin or pneumolysin- bacterial capsular poiysaccharide<br>
obtained by the process of the invention (as described above).<br>
The immunogenic composition of the invention preferably further comprises one or more<br>
members of the pneumococcal choline binding protein family, preferably choline binding<br>
protein A or an immunogenic fragment thereof and/or one or more members of the poly<br>
histidine triad family (including fusion proteins thereof), preferably PhtA, PhtB, PhtD or<br>
PhtE or an immunogenic fragment thereof.<br>
Concerning the Choline Binding Protein family (CbpX), members of this family were<br>
originally identified as pneumococcal proteins that could be purified by chollne-affinity<br>
chromatography.     All  of the choline-binding  proteins are  non-covalently  bound  to<br>
phosphorylcholine   moieties   of   ceil   wall   teichoic   acid   and   membrane-associated<br>
lipoteichoic acid. Structurally, they have several regions in common over the entire family,<br>
although the exact nature of the proteins (amino acid sequence, length, etc.) can vary. In<br>
general, choline binding proteins comprise an N terminal region (IM), conserved repeat<br>
regions (R1 and/or R2), a proiine rich region (P) and a conserved choline binding region<br>
(C), made up of multiple repeats, that comprises approximately one half of the protein. As<br>
used in this application, the term "Choline Binding Protein family (CbpX)" is selected from<br>
the group consisting of Choline Binding Proteins as identified in WO97/41151, PbcA,<br>
SpsA, PspC, CbpA, CbpD, and CbpG.   CbpA is disclosed in WO97/41151.   CbpD and<br>
CbpG are disclosed in WO00/29434.    PspC is disclosed in WO97/09994.    PbcA is<br>
disclosed In WO98/21337.SpsA is a Choiine binding protein disclosed in WO 98/39450.<br>
Preferably the Choline Binding Proteins are selected from the group consisting of CbpA,<br>
PbcA, SpsA and PspC.<br>
Another preferred embodiment is CbpX truncates wherein "CbpX" is defined above and<br>
"truncates" refers to CbpX proteins tacking 50% or more of the Choline binding region (C).<br>
Preferably such proteins lack the entire choline binding region. More preferably, the such<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
protein truncates lack (i) the chollne binding region and (ii) a portion of the N-terminal half<br>
of the protein as well, yet retain at least one repeat region (R1 or R2). More preferably<br>
still, the truncate has 2 repeat regions (R1 and R2), more preferably the truncate retains<br>
the praline rich region (P). Examples of such preferred embodiments are NR1XR2 and<br>
R1xR2 as illustrated in WO99/51266 or WO99/51188 and NR1XR2P, however, other<br>
choline binding proteins lacking a similar choline binding region are also contemplated<br>
within the scope of this invention.<br>
The LytX family is membrane associated proteins associated with cell lysis. The N-<br>
terminal domain comprises choline binding domain(s), however the LytX family does not<br>
have all the features found in the CbpA family noted above and thus the LytX family is<br>
considered distinct from the CbpX family, in contrast with the CbpX family, the C-terminal<br>
domain contains the catalytic domain of the LytX protein family. The family comprises<br>
LytA, B and C. With regards to the LytX family, LytA is disclosed In Ronda et al., Eur J<br>
Biochem, 164:621-624 (1987). LytB is disclosed in WO 98/18930, and is also referred to<br>
as Sp46. LytC is also disclosed in WO 98/18930, and is also referred to as Sp91. A<br>
preferred member of that family is LytC.<br>
Another preferred embodiment are LytX truncates wherein TytX" is defined above and<br>
"truncates" refers to LytX proteins lacking 50% or more of the Choline binding region.<br>
Preferably such proteins lack the entire choline binding region. An example of such<br>
truncates can be found in the Examples section of this invention.<br>
Yet another preferred embodiment of this invention are CbpX truncate-LytX truncate<br>

WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
The Pht (Poly Histidine Triad) family comprises proteins PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, and PhtE. The<br>
family is characterised by a lipidation sequence, two domains separated by a protine-rich<br>
region and several histidine triads, possibly involved in metal or nucleoside binding or<br>
enzymatic activity, (3-5) coiled-coil regions, a conserved N-terminus and a heterogeneous<br>
C terminus. It is present in all strains of pneumococci tested. Homologous proteins have<br>
also been found in other Streptococci and Meisseria. Preferred members of the family<br>
comprise PhtA, PhtB and PhtD. More preferably, it comprises PhtA or PhtD. It is<br>
understood, however, that the terms Pht A, B, D, and E refer to proteins having<br>
sequences disclosed in the citations below as well as naturalfy-occurring (and man-made)<br>
variants thereof that have a sequence homology that is at least 90% identical to the<br>
referenced proteins. Preferably it Is at least 95% identical and most preferably it is 97%<br>
identical.<br>
The imunogeni composition of the invention may incorporate fusion proteins of histidine<br>
triad proteins. Preferred fusion proteins contain i) PhtD or a fragment thereof linked to<br>
PhtE or a fragment thereof or ii) PhtB or a fragment thereof linked to PhtE or a fragment<br>
thereof.<br>
With regards to the PhtX proteins, PhtA is disclosed in WO 98/18930, and is also referred<br>
to Sp36. As noted above, it is a protein from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type<br>
II signal motif of LXXC.<br>
PhtD is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to SpO36D. As noted above, it<br>
also is a protein from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type II LXXC signal motif.<br>
PhtB is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to SpO36B. Another member of<br>
the PhtB family is the C3-Degrading Polypeptide, as disclosed in WO 00/17370. This<br>
protein also is from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type II LXXC signal motif. A<br>
preferred immunologically functional equivalent is the protein Sp42 disclosed in WO<br>
98/18930. A PhtB truncate (approximately 79kD) is disclosed in WO99/15675 which is<br>
also considered a member of the PhtX family.<br>
PhtE is disclosed in WOOO/30299 and is referred to as BVH-3.<br>
In order to generate an immunogenic composition of the invention, capable of eliciting an<br>
immune response against more than one pathogen involved in otitis media, it is<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2D04/0O2641<br>
advantageous for immunogenic compositions of the invention to further comprise an<br>
antigen from one or more (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ) of S. pneumoniae, non-typable Haemophilus<br>
influenzae, Nloraxella catarrhalis, RSV, paralnfluenza virus and /or influenza virus.<br>
The present invention also contemplates combination vaccines which provide protection<br>
against a range of different pathogens.   Many Paediatric vaccines are now given as a<br>
combination vaccine so as to reduce the number of injections a child has to receive. Thus<br>
for Paediatric vaccines other antigens from other pathogens may be formulated with the<br>
vaccines of the invention.  For example the vaccines of the invention can be formulated<br>
with (or administered separately but at the same time) the well known 'trivalent'<br>
combination vaccine comprising Diphtheria toxoid (DT), tetanus toxoid (TT), and pertussis<br>
components [typically detoxified Pertussis toxoid (PT) and filamentous haemagglutinin<br>
(FHA) with optional pertactin (PRN) and/or agglutinin 1+2], for example the marketed<br>
vaccine INFANRIX-DTPa™ (SmithKlineBeecham Bioiogicals) which contains DT, TT, PT,<br>
FHA and PRN antigens, or with a whole cell pertussis component for example as<br>
marketed by SmithKlineBeecham Bioiogicals s.a., as Tritanrix™.  The combined vaccine<br>
may also comprise other antigen, such as Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Polio virus<br>
antigens (for instance inactivated trivalent polio virus - IPV), Moraxella catarrhalis outer<br>
membrane proteins, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae proteins, N.meningitidis B<br>
outer membrane proteins.<br>

Other combinations contemplated are the cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin of the<br>
invention in combination with viral antigens, for example, from influenza (attenuated, split,<br>
or subunit [e.g., surface glycoproteins neuraminidase (NA) and haemagglutinin (HA). See,<br>
e.g., Chaloupka I. et al, Eur. Journal Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1996, 15:121-127], RSV<br>

supra). Varicella (e.g., attenuated, glycoproteins I-V, etc.), and any (or all) component(s)<br>
of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella).<br>
Vaccines<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is a vaccine comprising cytolysin, preferably<br>
pneumolysin or a pneumolysin-bacterial capsular polysaccharide conjugate, obtained by<br>
the process of the invention and a pharmaceuticaily acceptable excipient and optionally<br>
an adjuvant.<br>
A vaccine of the invention may comprise the immunogenic compositions of the invention<br>
described above and a pharmaceuticaily acceptable excipient.<br>
Vaccines of the invention are capable of generating a protective immune response against<br>
S. pneumoniae infection and/or otitis media.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention includes a method of making a vaccine by taking a<br>
cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin, made by the process of the invention and formulating it<br>
as a vaccine with a pharmaceuticaily acceptable excipient and optionally with one or more<br>
     of the further antigens described above.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention includes method of treatment or prevention of<br>
bacterial infection, preferably Streptococcus pneumoniae infection or otitis media<br>
comprising administration of the vaccine or immunogenic composition of the invention.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is the use of the cytolysin, preferably pneumolysin<br>
and/or pneumolysin - bacterial capsular polysaccharide conjugate, either of which is<br>
obtained by a process of the invention, in the preparation of a vaccine for the treatment or<br>
prevention of bacterial infection, preferably Streptococcus pneumoniae infection or otitis<br>
media.<br>
The vaccines of the present invention are preferably adjuvanted. Suitable adjuvants<br>
include an aluminium salt such as aluminium hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminium<br>
phosphate, but may also be a salt of calcium, magnesium, iron or zinc, or may be an<br>
insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine, or acylated sugars, cationically or anionically<br>
derivatised polysaccharides, or polyphosphazenes.<br>
It is preferred that the adjuvant be selected to be a preferential inducer of a TH1 type of<br>
response. Such high levels of Th1-type cytokines tend to favour the induction of cell<br>
mediated immune responses to a given antigen, whilst high levels of Th2-type cytokines<br>
tend to favour the induction of humoral immune responses to the antigen.<br>
It is Important to remember that the distinction of Th1 and Th2-type immune response is<br>
not absolute.  In reality an individual will support an immune response which is described<br>
as being predominantly Th1 or predominantly Th2.   However, it is often convenient to<br>
consider the families of cytokines in terms of that described in murine CD4 +ve T cell<br>
clones by Mosmann and Coffman (Mosmann, T.R. and Coffman, R.L. (1989) TH1 and<br>
TH2 cells: different patterns of lymphokine secretion lead to different functional properties.<br>
Annual Review of Immunology, 7, p145-173).   Traditionally, Th1-type responses are<br>
associated with the production of the INF^y and IL-2 cytokines by T-iymphocytes.  Other<br>
cytokines often directly associated with the induction of Th1-type immune responses are<br>
not produced by T-cells, such as 1L-12.  In contrast, Th2-type responses are associated<br>
with the secretion of II-4, IL-5, lL-6, IL-10.   Suitable adjuvant systems which promote a<br>
predominantly Th1 response include: Monophosphoryl lipid A or a derivative thereof,<br>
particularly 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL) (for its preparation see GB<br>
2220211 A); and a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-acylated<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A, together with either an aluminium salt (for instance aluminium<br>
phosphate or aluminium hydroxide) or an oil-in-water emulsion. In such combinations,<br>
antigen and 3D-MPL are contained in the same particulate structures, allowing for more<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
efficient delivery of antigenic and immunostimulatory signals. Studies have shown that 3D-<br>
MPL is able to further enhance the immunogenicity of an alum-adsorbed antigen [Thoelen<br>
eta/.Vaccine(1998) 16:708-14; EP689454-B1].<br>
An enhanced system involves the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin<br>
derivative, particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO<br>
94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol<br>
as disclosed in WO 96/33739.<br>
A particularly potent adjuvant formulation Involving QS21, 3D-MPL and tocopherol In an<br>
oil in water emulsion Is described in WO 95/17210, and is a preferred formulation.<br>
Preferably the vaccine additionally comprises a saponin, more preferably QS21. The<br>
formulation may also comprise an oil in water emulsion and tocopherol (WO 95/17210).<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing a vaccine formulation<br>
comprising mixing a cytolysin of the present invention together with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient, such as 3D-MPL<br>
Unmethylated CpG containing oligonucleotides (WO 96/02555) are also preferential<br>
inducers of a TH1 response and are suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a vaccine as herein described<br>
for use in medicine. In one embodiment there is a method of preventing or ameliorating<br>
 pneumonia In an elderly human (over 55 years old) comprising administering a safe and<br>
effective amount of a vaccine of the invention, and optionally a Th1 adjuvant, to said<br>
elderly patient.<br>
In a further embodiment there is provided a method of preventing or ameliorating otitis<br>
 media in Infants (up to 24 months) or toddlers (typically 24 months to 5 years), comprising<br>
administering a safe and effective amount of a vaccine comprising a cytolysin, preferably<br>
pneumolysin of the invention, optionally with one or more of the further antigens described<br>
above and optionally a Th1 adjuvant, to said Infant or toddler.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP20O4/0O2641<br>
The vaccine preparations of the present invention may be used to protect or treat a<br>
mammal (preferably a human patient) susceptible to infection, by means of administering<br>
said vaccine via systemic or mucosal route. These administrations may include injection<br>
via the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal or subcutaneous routes; or via mucosal<br>
administration   to   the   oral/alimentary,   respiratory,   genitourinary   tracts.   Intranasal<br>
administration of vaccines for the treatment of pneumonia or otitis media is preferred (as<br>
nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci can  be more effectively prevented, thus<br>
attenuating infection at its earliest stage). Although the vaccine of the invention may be<br>
administered as a single dose, components thereof may also be co-administered together<br>
at the same time or at different times (for instance if polysaccharides are present in a<br>
vaccine these could be administered separately at the same time or 1-2 weeks after the<br>
administration of the bacterial protein combination for optimal coordination of the Immune<br>
responses with respect to each other). In addition to a single route of administration, 2<br>
different routes of administration may be used.   For example, viral antigens may be<br>
administered   ID   (intradermal),  whilst  bacterial   proteins  may  be  administered   IM<br>
(intramuscular) or IN  (intranasal).     If polysaccharides  are present,  they may  be<br>
administered IM (or ID) and bacterial proteins may be administered IN (or ID). In addition,<br>
the vaccines of the invention may be administered IM for priming doses and IN for booster<br>
doses.<br>
The amount of conjugate antigen in each vaccine dose is selected as an amount which<br>
induces an immunoprotective response without significant, adverse side effects in typical<br>
vaccines. Such amount will vary depending upon which specific immunogen is employed<br>
and how it is presented. The content of protein antigens in the vaccine will typically be in<br>
the range 1-100|ig, preferably 5-50ng, most typically In the range 5 - 25ug. If<br>
polysaccharides are included, generally it is expected that each dose will comprise<br>
0.1-100 \ig of polysaccharide, preferably 0.1-50 \ig, more preferably 0.1-10 fig, of which 1<br>
to 5 ^g is the most preferable range.<br>
Optimal amounts of components for a particular vaccine can be ascertained by standard<br>
studies involving observation of appropriate immune responses in subjects.. Following an<br>
initial vaccination, subjects may receive one or several booster immunisations adequately<br>
spaced. Typically a vaccine will comprise antigen (proteins), an adjuvant, and excipients<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable earner.<br>

Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design (The subunit and adjuvant<br>
approach" (eds Powell M.F. &amp; Newman M.J.) (1995) Plenum Press New York).<br>
Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, US Patent 4,235,877.<br>
Although the vaccines of the present invention may be administered by any route,<br>
administration of the described vaccines into the skin (ID) forms one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Human skin comprises an outer "homy" cuticle, called the stratum<br>
comeum, which overlays the epidermis. Underneath this epidermis is a layer called the<br>
dermis, which in turn overlays the subcutaneous tissue. Researchers have shown that<br>
injection of a vaccine into the skin, and in particular the dermis, stimulates an immune<br>
response, which may also be associated with a number of additional advantages.<br>
intradermal vaccination with the vaccines described herein forms a preferred feature of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The conventional technique of intradermal injection, the "mantoux procedure", comprises<br>
steps of cleaning the skin, and then stretching with one hand, and with the bevel of a<br>
narrow gauge needle (26-31 gauge) facing upwards the needle is inserted at an angle of<br>
between 10-15°. Once the bevel of the needle is inserted, the barrel of the needle is<br>
lowered and further advanced whilst providing a slight pressure to elevate it under the<br>
skin. The liquid is then injected very slowly thereby forming a bieb or bump on the skin<br>
surface, followed by slow withdrawal of the needle.<br>
More recently, devices that are specifically designed to administer liquid agents into or<br>
across the skin have been described, for example the devices described in WO 99/34850<br>
and EP 1092444, also the jet injection devices described for example in WO 01/13977;<br>
US 5,480,381, US 5,599,302, US 5.334,144, US 5,993,412, US 5,649,912, US 5,569,189,<br>
US 5,704,911, US 5,383,851, US 5,893,397, US 5,466,220, US 5,339,163, US 5,312,335,<br>
US 5,503,627, US 5,064,413, US 5,520, 639, US 4,596,556, US 4,790,824, US<br>
4,941,880, US 4,940,460, WO 97/37705 and WO 97/13537. Alternative methods of<br>
intradermal administration of the vaccine preparations may include conventional syringes<br>
and needles, or devices designed for ballistic delivery of solid vaccines (WO 99/27961), or<br>
transdermal patches (WO 97/48440; WO 98/28037); or applied to the surface of the skin<br>
(transdermal or transcutaneous delivery WO 98/20734; WO 98/28037).<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT7EP2004/002641<br>
When the vaccines of the present invention are to be administered to the skin, or more<br>
specifically into the dermis, the vaccine is in a low liquid volume, particularly a volume of<br>
between about 0.05 ml and 0.2 ml.<br>
The content of antigens in the skin or intradermal vaccines of the present invention may<br>
be similar to conventional doses as found in intramuscular vaccines. Accordingly, the<br>
protein antigens present in the intradermal vaccines may in the range 1-IOOp.g, preferably<br>
5-50(ag, Likewise, if present, the amount of polysaccharide conjugate antigen in each<br>
vaccine dose is generally expected to comprise 0.1-100 (ig of polysaccharide, preferably<br>
0.1-50 pg, preferably 0.1-10 jjg, and may be between 1 and 5 ug. However, it is a feature<br>
of skin or intradermal vaccines that the formulations may be "low dose". Accordingly the<br>
protein antigens in "low dose" vaccines are preferably present in as little as 0.1 to 10|ig,<br>
preferably 0.1 to 5 ng per dose; and if present the polysaccharide conjugate antigens may<br>
be present in the range of 0.01-i^g, and preferably between 0.01  to 0.5 ng of<br>
polysaccharide per dose.<br>
As used herein, the term "intradermal delivery" means delivery of the vaccine to the region<br>
of the dermis in the skin. However, the vaccine will not necessarily be located exclusively<br>
in the dermis. The dermis is the layer in the skin located between about 1.0 and about 2.0<br>
mm from the surface in human skin, but there is a certain amount of variation between<br>
individuals and in different parts of the body. In general, it can be expected to reach the<br>
dermis by going 1.5 mm below the surface of the skin. The dermis is located between the<br>
stratum corneum and the epidermis at the surface and the subcutaneous layer below.<br>
Depending on the mode of delivery, the vaccine may ultimately be located solely or<br>
primarily within the dermis, or it may ultimately be distributed within the epidermis and the<br>
dermis.<br>
The immunogenic compositions and vaccines of the invention can be evaluated in various<br>
animal models or with human sera. As an illustration, the following animal models can be<br>
used to evaluate pneumococcal infection. C3H/HeJ Mice (6 to 3 week old) can be<br>
immunised s.c. with 15 jxg protein adjuvanted with 50 jd CFA, followed 3-4 weeks later by<br>
boosting with 15 ^ig protein with IFA. For demonstrating passive and active protection<br>
from systemic infection, mice can be administered intraperitoneally with immune sera or<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP20O4/002641<br>
proteins prior to challenge by Intraperitoneal injection with 15 to 90 LD50 pneumococd on<br>
week 8-10. Additionally, proteins can be tested in a mouse nasopharynx colonization<br>
model by (Wu et al Microbiai Pathogenesis 1997; 23:127-137).<br>
In addition to mice, infant rats are susceptible to colonisation and infection by S.<br>
pneumoniae. In passive protective studies, administration of mouse immune sera (100 ul<br>
i.p. or 10 ul i.n.) can be done prior to challenge with intranasal administration of'<br>
S.pneumonia (10 ul) in 2-5 day old infant rat pups. Colonisation can be determined by<br>
plating nasal washes (20-40 ul instilled, 10 ul withdrawn).<br>
Favourable interactions between the protein (or protein and polysaccharide) components<br>
of the combination vaccine may be demonstrated by administering a dose of each protein<br>
(or protein and polysaccharide) in the vaccine which would be sub-protective in a<br>
monovalent vaccine. Increased protective efficacy of the combination vaccine compared<br>
to monovalent vaccines can be attributed to a favourable interaction between the<br>
components.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the accompanying examples. The examples are carried out<br>
using standard techniques, which are well known and routine to those of skill in the art,<br>
except where otherwise described in detail. The examples are meant to illustrate, but not<br>
limit the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 Purification of Dneumolvsin<br>
After 18 hours induction of the E. coli culture by increasing the temperature to 39.5 °C, the<br>
E.coli were pelletted by centrifugation at 17,000g for 1 hour. The pellet was resuspended<br>
in 25mM diethanolamine pH9.0 and the E. cofi were mechanically broken using one pass<br>
 at 500 PSI in a Rannie apparatus. 1% Sodium lauroly sarcosinate (SLS) was added to the<br>
broken E.coli and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before<br>
centrifugation at 30,000g for 20 minutes so that cellular debris was pelleted. The<br>
supernatant was diluted 2.5 fold to end up in 20mM phosphate pH 7.0 containing 1M NaCI<br>
and 1% SLS and was then loaded onto a phenyt-sepharose HP column equilibrated in the<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
same buffer (20mM phosphate pH 7.0 containing 1M NaC! and 1% SLS = equilibration<br>
buffer). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of equilibration buffer followed by<br>
2 column volumes of 20mM phosphate buffer pH7.0 containing 0.5M NaCI and 1% SLS.<br>
Pneumolysin was eluted from the column by applying a low salt buffer containing 20mM<br>
phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 1% SLS. Fractions containing pneumolysin were<br>
identified using SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and the buffer was exchanged to 25mM<br>
diethanolamine pH 9.0 using diafiltration.<br>
The pneumolysin was solubilised by denaturation by adding solid guanidine hydrochloride<br>
up to 6M final concentration and incubating for one hour. It was then diafiitered against<br>
8M urea in 25mM diethanolamine pH9.0 containing 1mM DTT. Pneumolysin was refolded<br>
by diafiltration against 20mM borate buffer pH9.0 containing 1mM DTT. After renaturation,<br>
DTT was removed by diafiltration against 20mM borate buffer pH 9.0.<br>
The purity of the pneumolysin achieved was analysed by running on an SDS-PAGE and<br>
staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. A separate gel was analysed by Western blotting<br>
using an antibody against E. coli to detect the level of E.coli proteins remaining in the<br>
purified pneumolysin preparation. The biological activity of the purified pneumolysin was<br>
assessed using an in vitro haemolysis assay.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in figure 1, the method described above was able to produce a highly efficient<br>
purification of pneumolysin after a single chromatography step. The Coomassie blue<br>
stained gel in panel A shows that elution of the column with a low salt buffer containing<br>
no added sodium chloride was able to elute a 53kDa band corresponding to pneumolysin<br>
from the column in a highly purified form. The much fainter band of approximately 45kDa<br>
is also thought to be pneumolysin since this second band binds to anti-pneumolysin<br>
antibodies (results not show) and also fails to bind to the anti E. coli antibodies as shown<br>
in panel B. The Western blot of panel B is a highly sensitive method of detecting any<br>
contaminating proteins that remain in the purified pneumolysin. This method was able to<br>
detect very few contaminants and those present were at a low level that was below the<br>
detection level of Coomassie staining. The pneumolysin is therefore purified to a level of<br>
98-100% purity.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
The yield of the purification method is also good with a typical run giving around 1900 mg<br>
of pneumolysin per litre of fermentation. Approximately 10% of the protein from the<br>
fermentation culture was recovered as purified pneumolysin.<br>
The activity of the pneumolysin in a haemolysis assay was assessed after the<br>
pneumolysin had been treated with guanidinium hydrochoride/urea and had been refolded<br>
by removal of the denaturant. Haemolytic activity was detected in dilutions of the purified<br>
pneumotysin down to concentrations of 1.3 ng/ml showing that haemolytic activity had<br>
been re-established. This corresponds to between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Haemoiytic<br>
units per mg of wild-type pneumolysin.<br>
Example 2 - Detoxification of S. pneumoniae oneumolvsin using GMBS<br>
Purified pneumolysin was detoxified by modification of sulfhydryl and primary amine<br>
groups using the NHS ester-maleimide crosslinking reagent GMBS (N-(y-<br>
maleimidobutyry!oxy)succinimide ester). Pneumolysin at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml,<br>
was dialysed against 50mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The GMBS was initially dissolved in<br>
DMSO and was added to pneumolysin in at a 248-fold molar excess of GMBS. Treatment<br>
continued for one hour at room temperature. Excess GMBS and by-products were<br>
removed by dialysis against 100mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8. Further maleimide groups<br>
were quenched by reacting with 0.6mg/m! cysteine for two hours at room temperature. In<br>
order to remove excess cysteine, the sample was dialysed against 2mM sodium<br>
phosphate pH7.15.<br>
Example 3 - Characterization of detoxified pneumolvsin<br>
Haeroolvtic activity<br>
A hemolytic assay was used to assess the remaining toxicity of detoxified pneumolysin.<br>
Serial 2-fold dilutions of-pneumolysin were incubated with sheep red blood cells. After<br>
centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to immunoplates and released<br>
haemoglobin was measured using optical density reading at 405 nm. Results were<br>
expressed as ng/ml pneumolysin corresponding to the mid-point of the OD curve. The<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
assay was repeated after incubating the detoxified pneumolysin at 37 °C for 7 days to<br>
monitor the reversibility of detoxification.<br>
As shown in table 1, treatment with GMBS was able to substantially reduce the haemolytic<br>
activity of PLY with up to a 3,000 fold reduction in haemolytic activity being achieved.<br>
Higher molar ratios of GMBS/lysine were able to produce better removal of haemolytic<br>
activity with ratios of 4/1 and 5/1 being optimal in this experiment. This treatment was<br>
estimated to result In modification of about 14 lysine residues. Where fewer lysine<br>
residues were modified, the reduction in haemolytic activity was less.<br>
ELISA<br>
The antigenicity of the detoxified pneumolysin was assessed by ELISA. The ELiSA plates<br>
were coated with a guinea pig anti-pneumolysin antibody. Samples containing dilutions of<br>
pneumolysin were incubated in the plates for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing,<br>
the bound pneumolysin was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against<br>
pneumolysin, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing the plates, a substrate<br>
reaction was used to assess the amount of pneumolysin bound to each well.<br>
As shown in table 1, treatment with GMBS led to some loss of antigenicity as assessed by<br>
ELISA. However ELISA readings of approximately 66% of that given by untreated PLY<br>
could be achieved showing that many antibodies could still recognize the modified<br>
pneumolysin.<br>
SDS-PAGE-ana lysis<br>
The detoxified pneumolysin proteins were run on an SDS-PAGE (Novex 4-20%<br>
polyacrylamide gel Invitrogen) and Coomassie brilliant blue was used to visualize the<br>
proteins. As shown on figure 2, treatment with GMBS led to a slight increase in the<br>
molecular weight of PLY from 53kDa to approximately 56kDa. This increase is due to the<br>
modification of multiple amino acid residues with GMBS. A small percentage of PLY is<br>
converted to -multimeric forms as seen by the appearance of faint bands of molecular<br>
weight of approximately 110kDa and 170kDa, however, most of the PLY remains in an<br>
essentially monomeric form. Incubation of the PLY at 37°C for 7 days did not results in<br>
any substantial change in the appearance of the PLY on an SDS-PAGE showing that the<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2004/081515<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/002641<br><br>
modified PLY is not subject to degradation or subsequent covalently-linked multimer<br>
formation.<br>

Examole 4 Reactoaenicitv evaluation of detoxified pneumotvsin in rats<br>
Groups of three OFA rats were immunised once by intramuscular (tibialis) inoculation with<br>
saline, the adjuvant QS21 (US5.057.540), pneumolysin, adjuvanted pneumolysln,<br>
formaldehyde detoxified pneumolysin, adjuvanted formaldehyde detoxified pneumolysin,<br>
GMBS detoxified pneumolysin, adjuvanted GMBS detoxified pneumolysin, NHS-acetate<br>
detoxified pneumolysin or adjuvanted NHS-acetate detoxified pneumolysin. Three days<br>
after immunisation, all the rats were killed and the tibialis were prepared for histological<br>
examination. The tibialis were fixed in formalin and cut into 2mm slices which were<br>
dehydrated and paraffin embedded. 7um sections were cut and stained using the<br>
Trichrome Masson method, before being examined microscopically.<br>
Reactogenicity was evaluated using four criteria; degeneration/necrosis, endomyslal<br>
inflammation, haemorrhage and aponeurosis inflammation. For each histological criterion,<br>
a score was attributed to each muscle of each group and a mean lesion score was then<br>
calculation for each group. A score of 0 = normal, 1 = minimal, 2 = slight, 3 = moderate, 4<br>
= marked and 5 = severe.<br>
The histology of sections was examined. The mean scores for degeneration/necrosis,<br>
endomysial inflammation, haemorrhage and aponeurosis inflammation are shown in Table<br>
2.<br>

A comparison of histological scores for unadjuvanted native and detoxified pneumolysin<br>
shows that GMBS is a particularly effective cross-linking reagent to use for the<br>
detoxification of pneumolysin, producing a large decrease in degeneration/necrosis,<br>
endomysial inflammation, haemorrhage and aponeurosis inflammation.<br>
The addition of adjuvant (50ug aluminium phosphate and 5ug MPL) to the inoculations<br>
increases the amount of reactogenicity as a side effect of stimulating the immune system.<br>
Detoxification of pneumolysin with GMBS allowed the level of degeneration/necrosis to be<br>
reduced to that produced by the adjuvant alone which was lower than the level produced<br>
by inoculation with native pneumolysin. GMBS detoxified pneumolysin produced a level of<br>
haemorrhage lower than that produced by native pneumolysin. Levels of endomysial<br>
inflammation were elevated by the adjuvant and this level was still present in the presence<br>
of adjuvanted native or GMBS detoxified pneumolysin. Aponeurosis inflammation was<br>
however reduced from the level produced by adjuvant alone by native or GMBS detoxified<br>
pneumolysin, with the level of aponeurosis being slightly lower where the pneumolysin<br>
had been treated with GMBS.<br>
Example 5 - Evaluation of toxicity of GMBS treated pneumolvsin in mice<br>
Groups of 20 OF1 mice were challenged intranasally with either native pneumolysin or<br>
GMBS-treated pneumolysin and the mice were monitored for the following 9 days.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, challenge with 2ug of native pneumolysin led very quickly to the<br>
death of all the mice in that group. The pneumolysin produced lesions throughout the<br>
respiratory system which led to respiratory difficulties and death. In contrast, the GMBS<br>
treated pneumolysin had substantially reduced toxicity with all of the mice inoculated with<br>
2ug, 5ug or 10ug of the GMBS treated pneumolysin surviving the challenge.<br>
Example 6 - protection studies using detoxified pneumolvsin<br>
Groups of 20 OF1 mice were immunised 3 times intramuscularly, on days 0, 14 and 28<br>
with 5ug of pneumolysin and 50ug aluminium phosphate and 5ug MPL as adjuvant.<br>
Control mice were immunised with adjuvant alone. The pneumolysin was either untreated<br>
or detoxified using the GMBS treatment described above.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2004/081515	PCT/EP2004/002641<br>
On day 42, the mice were given an intranasal, lethal challenge with 2ug of native<br>
pneumolysin. The survival of the mice over the following 9 days was monitored.<br>
Results<br>
The lethal challenge model led to 90% mortality in control mice (Figure 4). Immunisation<br>
with GMBS detoxified pneumolysin produced very good protection with only 5% of mice<br>
dying during the following 9 days. This was comparable to protection given after<br>
inoculation with native pneumolysin, following which 10% of mice died.<br>
Example 7 Evaluation of detoxified pneumotvsin in combination with PhtO in a mouse<br>
lethal challenge model<br>
Groups of 20 OF1 mice were immunised intramuscularly with a) adjuvant alone or b) 1ug<br>
PhtD and adjuvant or c) tug PhtD and 5ug GMBS detoxified pneumolysin and adjuvant.<br>
The adjuvant used was composed of 50ug aluminium phosphate and 5ug MPL and<br>
immunisations took place on day 0 and day 14. The mice were challenged with an<br>
intranasal lethal dose of 5.105 CFU of serotype 2 S. pneumoniae strain D39 and survival<br>
was monitored over the next 10 days.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in Figure 5, challenge with strain D39 led to 75% lethality after 10 days in<br>
control mice. Immunisation with PhtD alone did not provide significant protection with 70%<br>
of mice in this group dying after 10 days (p=0.29). Immunisation with PhtD together with<br>
GMBS detoxified pneumolysin gave significantly better protection with lethality being<br>
reduced to 50% (p=0.04).<br>
Example 8 Detoxification of pneimolvsin using formaldehyde<br>
 A stock of purified pneumolysin at a concentration of approximately 0.4mg/ml was in<br>
25mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 wa treated with 50mM L-lysine and 0.1%<br>
formaldehyde (w/v) for 21 days at 4p°C.<br>
