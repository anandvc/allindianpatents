				<td>A METHOD AND A FACILITY FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING,<br>
AND FILLING A FLUID DISPENSER DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a<br>
facility for manufacturing, assembling, and filling a<br>
fluid dispenser device.<br>
Fluid dispenser devices are well known from the<br>
state of the art. In particular in the field of<br>
Pharmaceuticals, it can be essential to guarantee<br>
absolute sterility for the fluid, i.e. the medication, to<br>
be dispensed. For this purpose, it is known that filters<br>
can be provided for air venting, and that actions of the<br>
bactericide type can be applied to the fluid being<br>
delivered, in particular at the dispensing orifice of the<br>
device. However, an essential condition is also to<br>
guarantee absolute sterility at the time of filling of<br>
the device.<br>
Machines exist that enable a reservoir to be made,<br>
to be filled, and then to be closed, all of that being<br>
performed in a sterile controlled atmosphere. That type<br>
of machine, generally referred to as a Blow Fill Seal<br>
(BFS) machine is, for example, used for packaging<br>
physiological serum. Unfortunately, such BFS machines<br>
are not adapted to fixing a dispensing member, such as a<br>
pump or a valve, to the reservoir before or after<br>
filling.<br>
It is also known that a reservoir, such as a<br>
syringe, can be pre-filled, and that the syringe can then<br>
be assembled into a dispenser device, the inside of the<br>
syringe being put into communication with the dispensing<br>
member at the time the device is used, and in particular<br>
by the stopper of the syringe being pierced. In which<br>
case, firstly drawbacks exist that are inherent to<br>
piercing an elastomer stopper, and secondly, since the<br>
pre-filled syringe is not assembled continuously in the<br>
controlled atmosphere, the sterility of the device, and<br>
in particular of the piercing needle is not guaranteed.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method and a facility for manufacturing, assembling, and<br>
filling a fluid dispensing device that does not reproduce<br>
the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method and a facility for manufacturing,<br>
assembling, and filling a fluid dispenser device that<br>
guarantees absolute sterility for the fluid contained<br>
inside the device, without any risk of contamination<br>
during any step of the process.<br>
The present invention thus provides a facility for<br>
manufacturing, assembling, and filling a fluid dispenser<br>
device comprising a fluid reservoir and a dispensing<br>
member, such as a pump or a valve, said facility being<br>
characterized in that it comprises a manufacturing unit<br>
for manufacturing a reservoir, a filling unit for filling<br>
said reservoir, and a fixing unit for fixing said<br>
dispensing member to said reservoir, said units operating<br>
continuously in a controlled atmosphere.<br>
Advantageously, the manufacturing unit is a unit for<br>
molding, overmolding, blowing, folding, sealing, and/or<br>
thermoforming.<br>
Advantageously, the filling unit co-operates with<br>
the reservoir, with the dispensing member or with a<br>
filling element secured to said reservoir, and/or with<br>
said dispensing member.<br>
Advantageously, the fixing unit for fixing the<br>
dispensing member is a snap-fastening, crimping, screwfastening,<br>
sealing, or overmolding unit.<br>
Advantageously, the facility further comprises a<br>
dispensing member assembly unit operating continuously in<br>
said controlled atmosphere with the other units.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of<br>
making a fluid dispenser device comprising a reservoir<br>
and a dispensing member, such as a pump or a valve, said<br>
method being characterized in that it comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
a) providing a manufacturing unit for<br>
manufacturing a reservoir, a filling unit for<br>
filling said reservoir, and a fixing unit for<br>
fixing said dispensing member to said<br>
reservoir;<br>
b) organizing said units and causing them to cooperate<br>
in a manner such that they operate<br>
continuously in a controlled atmosphere.<br>
Advantageously, the units are organized in a manner<br>
such that the manufacturing unit makes the reservoir,<br>
then the filling unit fills it, and then the fixing unit<br>
fixes the dispensing member to the filled reservoir, all<br>
of this being performed in a controlled atmosphere.<br>
In a variant, the units are organized in a manner<br>
such that the manufacturing unit makes the reservoir,<br>
then the fixing unit fixes the dispensing member to the<br>
empty reservoir, then the filling unit fills the<br>
reservoir.<br>
Advantageously, the units are organized such that<br>
the manufacturing unit makes the reservoir, then the<br>
fixing unit pre-assembles the dispensing member to the<br>
reservoir, then the filling unit fills the reservoir, and<br>
then the fixing unit definitively fixes the dispensing<br>
member to the reservoir.<br>
Advantageously, the filling unit co-operates with<br>
the dispensing member to fill the reservoir through said<br>
dispensing member.<br>
Advantageously, the filling unit co-operates<br>
directly with the reservoir in order to fill it.<br>
In a variant, said filling unit co-operates with an<br>
intermediate element secured to the reservoir and/or to<br>
the dispensing member.<br>
Advantageously, said intermediate element is a<br>
flexible sleeve fixed in leaktight manner firstly to the<br>
reservoir and secondly to the dispensing member, and<br>
provided with a filling opening, said conical sleeve<br>
being manufactured and fixed to the reservoir by the<br>
manufacturing unit for manufacturing the reservoir, being<br>
fixed to the fixing member by the fixing unit while the<br>
dispensing member is being pre-assembled to the<br>
reservoir, and being deformed towards the inside of the<br>
reservoir by the fixing unit while the dispensing member<br>
is being definitively fixed to said reservoir.<br>
In another implementation, the method further<br>
comprises a step of providing a dispensing member<br>
assembly unit that operates continuously in said<br>
controlled atmosphere with the other units.<br>
Advantageously, the units are organized in a manner<br>
such that the dispensing member assembly unit makes the<br>
dispensing member, then the reservoir manufacturing unit<br>
makes a reservoir, then the fixing unit fixes said<br>
reservoir to said dispensing member, and then the filling<br>
unit fills said reservoir.<br>
Advantageously, the reservoir manufacturing unit and<br>
the fixing unit co-operate to manufacture the reservoir<br>
on the assembled dispensing member in particular by<br>
overmolding.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention appear more clearly from the following detailed<br>
description of a particular implementation given by way<br>
of non-limiting example and with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing the steps in<br>
the process of manufacturing the reservoir, in a<br>
particular implementation of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view of the fluid<br>
dispenser device with the dispensing member pre-assembled<br>
to the reservoir, prior to filling;<br>
Figure 3 is a view similar to the Figure 2 view;<br>
Figure 4 is a view of the preceding device, during<br>
the filling process;<br>
Figure 5 is a view of the preceding device during<br>
the process of definitively fixing the dispensing member<br>
to the reservoir; and<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic view of the device as<br>
assembled and ready to use.<br>
The figures show a particular implementation of the<br>
invention. In this implementation, a facility is<br>
provided for manufacturing, assembling, and filling a<br>
fluid dispenser device which comprises a fluid reservoir<br>
10 to which a dispensing member 20 such as a pump is<br>
assembled.<br>
In the invention, the facility comprises a unit for<br>
manufacturing a reservoir 10, a unit for filling said<br>
reservoir 10, and a unit for fixing said pump 20 to said<br>
reservoir 10, said units operating continuously in a<br>
controlled atmosphere, and in particular under sterile<br>
conditions. Thus, the facility of the present invention<br>
makes it possible to perform all of the steps in the<br>
process of manufacturing, filling, and assembling the<br>
fluid dispenser device in the same controlled atmosphere<br>
without any interruption, thereby guaranteeing absolute<br>
sterility for the finished product.<br>
As shown in the figures, which show a particular<br>
implementation, the reservoir 10 is advantageously formed<br>
of a rigid shell which is fixed to a conical and flexible<br>
filling element 30 that incorporates a filling<br>
opening 31.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows the process of<br>
manufacturing said filling element 30. Starting from a<br>
sheet, and in particular a sheet of aluminum, the<br>
reservoir manufacturing unit firstly folds said sheet of<br>
aluminum, and then contact points are bonded together to<br>
form a deformable conical sleeve, incorporating at least<br>
one filling opening 31. The sleeve 30 is then assembled<br>
onto the reservoir 10, which in this example is<br>
advantageously a rigid reservoir, also by means of the<br>
reservoir manufacturing unit.<br>
Advantageously, the dispenser member 20, which, in<br>
this example, is a pump, is then pre-assembled onto said<br>
filling element 30 by the unit for fixing the dispensing<br>
member to the reservoir. Figure 2 shows the preassembled<br>
position, in which the filling element 30<br>
connects the reservoir 10 to said dispensing member 20.<br>
Preferably, the filling element (in this example the<br>
conical sleeve 30) is fixed to the reservoir in leaktight<br>
manner, and similarly the dispensing member (in this<br>
example the pump 20) is pre-assembled to the conical<br>
sleeve 30 also in leaktight manner. The device in this<br>
pre-assembled position can also be seen in Figure 3.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the filling unit is then<br>
applied to the pre-assembled device. In the example<br>
shown in Figure 4, said filling unit comprises an outer<br>
sleeve 51 which is applied in leaktight manner to the<br>
reservoir 10, and an inner sleeve 52 which is applied in<br>
leaktight manner to the dispensing member 20, which is<br>
held in the pre-assembled position by means of a support<br>
element 53 advantageously provided between the pump 20<br>
and the reservoir 10. The filling unit then fills the<br>
reservoir 10 by injecting the fluid P between the sleeves<br>
51 and 52, it then being possible for said fluid to<br>
penetrate into the reservoir through a filling orifice 31<br>
provided in the conical sleeve 30. Simultaneously, the<br>
air A initially contained in the reservoir 10 can be<br>
released by exiting also via an orifice 31 in the sleeve<br>
30 and by then being removed to the atmosphere by flowing<br>
between the two sleeves of the filling unit. The<br>
flexible conical filling element 30 may thus be provided<br>
with one or more filling orifices.<br>
Once the device has been filled, a fixing unit for<br>
fixing the dispensing member 20 to the reservoir 10 then<br>
applies an axial force F to the dispensing member 20 so<br>
as to fix it to the reservoir 10. For this purpose, the<br>
support element 53 for supporting the filling unit is<br>
removed, and the force F may, for example, be applied to<br>
the pump 20 by the inner sleeve 52 of said filling unit,<br>
as shown in Figure 5. The pump 20 is then moved towards<br>
the reservoir 10 so as to be fastened to the neck by any<br>
suitable means, e.g. snap-fastening, crimping, sealing,<br>
etc. The conical sleeve 30 is deformed towards the<br>
inside of the reservoir 10 during this process of fixing<br>
the pump 20, as can be seen clearly in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 shows the device as filled, assembled, and<br>
ready to use, which device may advantageously be packaged<br>
in a sterile bag so that, when the user wishes to use the<br>
device, said user is certain that there has been no<br>
interruption in the controlled atmosphere throughout the<br>
entire process of manufacturing, filling, and assembling<br>
the device.<br>
Naturally, the above-described manufacturing,<br>
assembling, and filling method and facility constitute<br>
merely an advantageous implementation of the invention.<br>
Numerous variants may be imagined for implementing the<br>
invention. In particular, the reservoir may be of any<br>
type, and is not necessarily constituted by a rigid<br>
shell. For example, the reservoir may be a flexible<br>
pouch, in particular made of aluminum, a blister pack, a<br>
thermoformed shell, a blown reservoir, in particular<br>
blown in a BFS machine, or any other reservoir that can<br>
be used in fluid dispenser devices. Similarly, the<br>
presence of the filling element 30 is not necessary, it<br>
being possible for the filling unit to co-operate either<br>
directly with the dispensing member 20 so as to fill the<br>
reservoir therethrough, or directly with a filling<br>
orifice provided in the reservoir 10, e.g. through the<br>
bottom of said reservoir. In addition, the chronological<br>
order of the steps in the manufacturing, assembling, and<br>
filling method is not necessarily as described in the<br>
example given with reference to the figures. Thus, the<br>
filling unit may fill the reservoir before the dispensing<br>
member is assembled or pre-assembled thereto. Similarly,<br>
the dispensing member may be fully assembled to the empty<br>
reservoir, and then the device may be filled, either<br>
directly through an orifice provided in the reservoir, or<br>
through the dispensing member as mentioned above.<br>
Another variant is to provide a dispensing member<br>
assembly unit which also operates continuously in a<br>
controlled atmosphere, with the other above-described<br>
units. Such a dispensing member assembly unit may then<br>
make the dispensing member, (the pump in this example),<br>
and then the reservoir may be fixed to said pump by the<br>
fixing unit before the device is filled by the filling<br>
unit. In this variant, the unit for manufacturing the<br>
reservoir, and the unit for fixing the dispensing member<br>
to the reservoir may co-operate so as to cause the<br>
reservoir to be fixed directly, e.g. by overmolding, to<br>
the pump assembled by the dispensing member assembly<br>
unit.<br>
The essential characteristic of the present<br>
invention is for all of the processes of manufacturing,<br>
assembling, and filling a fluid dispenser device, in<br>
particular for dispensing a pharmaceutical, to be<br>
performed in a controlled atmosphere, and in particular<br>
under sterile conditions. The order of the steps, the<br>
configurations of the various units, and the particular<br>
shapes of the component portions of the device are not<br>
limiting, and the person skilled in the art may make<br>
various modifications to the method and facility<br>
described with reference to the figures, without going<br>
beyond the ambit of the present invention, as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br>
