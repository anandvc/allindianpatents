				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in generai relates to Remote Operated Devices (e.g. TVs, Music Systems etc.). Particularly this invention relates to operating the electronic devices using a remote in case of power failures. More particularly this invention relates to a method and system for programming devices by remote control without power supply.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the existing technology when power goes off, electronic systems are inoperable using Remote. This means that, if power goes off when the user is watching TV, he/she needs to go and access the main switch points of the system and switch it off, as all electronic systems restart when power comes back, if main switch of the system is left ON.<br>
One of the mechanisms that can be used to avoid such scenario is to have full power backup using UPS. In this case, electronic systems get connected to UPS power supply when main power supply is not available and thus will be in operating mode.<br>
There are following limitations to the existing art:<br>
1.	Most electronic systems restarts when power comes back on after power failure, so one needs to, for example, put off the TV Switch to switch off the system. It will be easier to operate if the system can be turned off using remote even there is no main power supply.<br>
2.	The current equipment does not allow the user to program/command them. This will annoy the person who is watching TV in the night, for example, want to set their TV to switch on at 6.00AM and power goes off. It is difficult to the said person to wait till the power comes back and set the TV to switch on at 6.00AM.<br>
3. UPS will help in case of power failures, but not all people can afford the cost of full power backup for the electronic systems in use. The cost of UPS is high and all people may not be able to afford to have UPS. And the UPS system itself may fail.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
By this invention, remote controller can be used to program devices even during power failures and without power backup. The method and system disclosed will help in issuing the commands to the System using the remote controller, involving conventional rechargeable battery and addition circuitry. When power goes off, standby circuitry and interface circuitry takes power from rechargeable battery. Standby circuitry disconnects the main circuitry and interfaces with remote interface for storing the user commands issued via remote in nonvolatile memory and transferring the same to main circuitry when power comes back.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method and system for programming devices by remote control without power supply comprising an additional/standby circuitry, Non-volatile memory and a rechargeable battery, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	Addition circuitry disconnecting the Main Power Supply<br>
b.	Collecting the user commands and storing them in the permanent storage<br>
c.	Providing the stored commands to the Main circuitry when main power supply is available.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to method and system for programming devices by remote control without power supply wherein an additional/standby circuitry is active only when main power supply is not available.<br>

Accordingly the present invention relates to method and system for programming devices by remote control without power supply wherein a permanent storage (Non-volatile) memory is used to store the commands when main power supply is not available.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system for programming devices by remote control without power supply comprising:<br>
(a)	a rechargeable battery which is charged with main power supply when available and which provides the power to a standby circuitry and an interface circuitry on the absence of main power supply;<br>
(b)	an interface Circuitry which disconnects standby circuitry and connects remote interface to main circuitry when main power supply is available and further connects standby circuitry and remote interface when the Main power supply is not available;<br>
(c)	a standby circuitry which disconnects the main power supply when there is no main power; and<br>
(d) a non-volatile memory which retains the user commands even when the rechargeable battery is exhausted.<br>
The standby circuitry drives the LCD / LED display for using the remote to program the system when the said system is loaded with a display unit. The standby circuitry stores all user commands in the Flash / Non-volatile Memory. The standby circuitry retrieves the commands from non-volatile memory and transfers to the main circuitry when power comes up. The standby circuitry and interface circuitry takes power from rechargeable battery. Ail other circuits other than standby circuitry and interface circuitry inside the system get power from device's power supply circuit and the main circuitry activates / controls the system as a whole where the remote interface is embedded in the device which mainly interacts with REMOTE and passes the user commands to main circuitry.<br>
Accordingly, this invention also explains a method for programming devices by remote control without power supply comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing the power to a standby circuitry and an interface circuitry on the absence of main power supply by a rechargeable battery which is charged with main power supply when available;<br>

The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from ensuing the detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 depicts proposed system architecture for operating remote operated consumer products when there is a power failure and where no UPS is available.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail. <br>
Standby circuitry and interface circuitry takes power from rechargeable battery. Interface circuitry is one which connects remote interface with standby (when power goes off) or Main circuitry (when main power supply is available). When power goes off, interface circuitry disconnects remote interface from main circuitry and connects it with Standby circuitry. From then on, standby circuitry interacts with remote interface just like main circuitry. It Drives the LCD/LED Display for human interaction while using the remote to program the System and stores all user commands in the Flash/Non-volatile Memory. Thus, the user commands are retained even when the rechargeable battery is exhausted.<br>
When power comes back, standby circuitry retrieves the commands from Non¬volatile Memory and transfers to the Main Circuitry, interface circuitry disconnects remote interface from standby circuitry and connects it with Main Circuitry, hence allowing system to operate in normal mode.<br>
The components mentioned the diagram can be realized using a single microprocessor chip.<br>
Main components involved in this invention are,<br>
1.	Rechargeable Battery<br>
•	Charged with main power supply when available.<br>
•	Provides the power to Standby Circuitry and Interface Circuitry (Remote and Main Circuitry) on the absence of main power supply.<br>
2.	Interface Circuitry<br>
•	Arbitrator among Remote Interface, Main Circuitry and Standby Circuitry<br>
•	Disconnects Standby Circuitry and Connects Remote Interface to Main Circuitry when Main Power Supply is available<br>
•	Connects Standby Circuitry and Remote Interface when the Main Power Supply is not available<br>
3.	Standby Circuitry<br>
•	Disconnects the Main Power supply when there is no main power.<br>
•	Drives the LCD/LED Display for using the remote to program the System in case the system has got the display unit. The point to be noted here is the, this circuitry can not bring the system to operative mode. It can just make the system's interface for remote commands to be active.<br>
•	Stores all user commands in the Flash/Non-volatile Memory<br>
•	Retrieves the commands from Non-volatile Memory and transfers to the Main Circuitry when power comes up.<br>
4. Non-Volatile Memory o Retains the user commands even the rechargeable battery is exhausted o Memory of 1 MB capacity will be more than sufficient.<br>
Figure 1 describes about the internal circuitry of a typical electronic system. ( For example let us consider TV system). System will be having power supply circuitry which powers up the device, using main power supply in home.<br>
All other circuits inside the system get power from device's power supply circuit. Main circuitry is the one which activates / controls the system as a whole. Remote interface is embedded in the device which mainly interacts with REMOTE and passes the user commands to main circuitry.<br>
By this invention, Standby circuitry, NV memory, Interface Circuitry and Rechargeable batteries have to be added with existing circuits. Former 2 units /circuits will be idle as long as main circuitry is getting power from main power supply. When main power supply is unavailable, main circuitry loses its full control wherein interface circuitry connects standby with system's remote interface and thus makes it operable using REMOTE.<br>
From then on, when the user programs the device using REMOTE, the commands are received using remote interface (which is powered using rechargeable battery) and sent to standby circuitry, which then passes those commands to Non volatile memory.<br>
When power comes back, standby circuitry reads the stored commands from non volatile memory and sends to main circuitry which is active. Main circuitry process those user commands and programs the device accordingly. After transferring user commands to main circuitry, standby goes back to idle state.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another.<br>
This invention is however, susceptible to modifications and alternate constructions from that disclosed above which are fully equivalent. Consequently, it is not the intention to limit this invention to the particular embodiment disclosed. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications and alternate constructions coming within the spirit and scope of the invention as generally expressed by the following claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of the invention.<br>
