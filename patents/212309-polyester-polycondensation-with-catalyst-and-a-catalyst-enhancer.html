"POLYESTER POLYCONDENSATION WITH CATALYST AND A CATALYST<br>
ENHANCER"	'<br><br><br><br>
ATOFINA CHEMICALS, INC., a corporation organised under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania of   2000 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br>
	19103-3222, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
  GRANTED<br>
 16 JAN 2002<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to polyester polycondensation with catalyst and a catalyst enhancer.<br>
Reference to Related Application<br>
[0001]	This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application<br>
Serial Number 09/747,115, filed December 22, 2000, which claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/175,006, filed January 7, 2000, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to synergistic combinations of titanium containing<br>
. catalysts and catalyst enhancers of carboxylic acid or oxalic acid or their Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and ammonium salts that are useful for manufacturing polyesters. The synergistic combination of the titanium containing catalysts with a catalyst enhancer such as an oxalic acid, an oxalic acid salt or a carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid salt provides fast reactions with improved properties such as reduced acetaldehyde content and good color properties for the resulting polyester at substantially reduced catalyst levels.<br>
Description of tbe Prior Art<br>
[0003]	Polycondensation reactions that produce polyesters require an extremely long<br>
period of time that is significantly reduced by a suitable catalyst. Various types of catalysts<br>
are used to shorten the reaction time. For example, antimony trioxide, antimony triacetate<br>
and antimony trisglycoxide are generally used as polycondensation catalysts.<br>
[0004]	Titanyl   oxalate   compounds   have  been   suggested  as   catalysts   for<br>
polycondensation reactions to produce polyesters. However, titanyl oxalate catalysts when used as polycondensation catalysts for polyesters have caused color problems in the resulting polyester.<br>
[0005]	Polyesters   are   obtained   by   esterification,   ester   interchange   or<br>
polycondensation of dibasic acids such as terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid or esters<br>
2<br><br>
thereof, functional derivatives of acid chlorides and glycols such as ethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol or oxides thereof and functional derivatives of carbonic acid derivatives. In this case, a single polyester is obtained when one dibasic acid component and glycol component are used. Mixed copolyesters can be obtained when at least two or more types of dibasic acid component and glycol component are mixed, esterified or subjected to ester interchange and then subjected to polycondensation. When a single polyester or two or more initial polycondensates of a mixed copolyester are subjected to polycondensation, an ordered polyester is obtained. In this invention, the term polyester is a general designation for these three types.<br>
[0006]	Prior literature has disclosed titanyl oxalate compounds for use as<br>
polycondensation catalysts for polyesters. The titanyl oxalate compounds disclosed include potassium titanyl oxalate, ammonium titanyl oxalate, lithium titanyl oxalate, sodium titanyl oxalate, calcium titanyl oxalate, strontium titanyl oxalate, barium titanyl oxalate, zinc titanyl oxalate and lead titanyl titanate. However, based upon the examples in such literature references, only potassium and ammonium titanyl oxalate have actually been used to catalyze the polyester forming reaction. See for example Japanese Patent Publication 42-13030, published on 25, July, 1967. European Patent application EP 0699700 A2 published 3/6/1996 assigned to Hoechst and entitled "Process for production of Thermostable, Color-neutral, Antimony-Free Polyester and Products Manufactured From It" discloses the use as polycondensation catalyst, however only potassium titanyl oxalate and titanium isopropylate were used for such a catalyst, and, while improved color and antimony free polyester are disclosed, cobalt or optical brighteners were also employed. Other patents have disclosed potassium titanyl oxalate as a polycondensation catalyst for making polyester such as U.S. Patent 4,245,086, inventor Keiichi Uno et al., Japanese Patent JP 06128464, Inventor Ishida, M. et al. U. S. Patent 3,951,886, entitled "Process of Producing Polyester Resin" of Hideo, M. et al, at column 3, line 59 to column 4, line 10, contains a disclosure of titanyl oxalate catalysts for polyesters including a listing of many types of titanyl oxalate catalyst. However, only potassium titanyl oxalate and ammonium titanyl oxalate were used in the examples and lithium titanyl oxalate was not even listed among their preferred titanyl oxalate catalysts.<br>
3<br><br>
[0007]	Titanium based catalysts have shown very high polycondensation activity,<br>
however; the resulted polyesters are yellowish color which will limit their applications. Therefore, prior art activity has been directed towards the development of modified titanium catalysts. Titanium compounds are not a good sole catalyst. Ti requires a cocatalysts or modifiers/promoters to form composite catalyst. Titanium compounds in the general formula of Ti(OR)4, Ti(III)Ti(IV)yO(3+4y)/2, RO[Ti(OR)20]nR have been widely claimed by others. Cocatalysts or modifiers/promoters, such as antimony compounds, tin compounds, zirconium compounds, silicon compounds, cobalt compound, aluminum compounds, alkali metal compounds, rare earth metal compounds, magnesium compounds, germanium compounds, zinc compounds, lanthanide series compounds, phosphorus compounds, halides, sulfur containing compounds, ammonia hydroxide, and amines, have been claimed together with Ti compounds.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[00024]	The production of polyester by polycondensation of polyester forming<br>
reactants is well known to those skilled in the polyester art. A conventional catalyst for the<br>

at least 0.1 part based upon the weight of titanium. Preferred is from about 1 part to about 40 parts per million of catalyst based on the weight titanium in the catalyst and the weight of the of polyester forming reactants.<br>
[00038]	When used in combination with an enhancer, a catalytically effective amount<br>
of an antimony containing catalyst should be added to the polyester forming reactants. Preferred is from about 1 part to about 240 parts per million of catalyst based on the weight antimony in the catalyst and the weight of the of polyester forming reactants. For.enhancing an antimony containing catalyst, an effective amount for of an enhancer for the catalytic activity of an antimony containing catalyst is at least about 0.1 part of enhancer per part of antimony containing catalyst based the weight of antimony in said antimony containing catalyst. Preferred is from about 0.1 part to about 80 parts enhancer per part of catalyst based upon the total weight of titanium in the catalyst.<br>
[00039]	The preferred amount of a antimony or germanium containing catalyst for<br>
use in combination with the enhanced titanium oxalate or titanium containing catalyst<br>
described above is from about 0.1 parts to about 80 parts based upon the weight of titanium.<br>
Preferred is from 1 to 40 parts of antimony or germanium containing catalyst.<br>
[00040]	The catalyst and enhancer mixtures of the present invention are used to make<br>
polyester typically by first dissolving them in a solvent that is compatible with polyester<br>
forming reactants, or preferable in one of the reactants itself, such as ethylene glycol.<br>
[00041]	The synergistic performance of the catalyst enhancer in combination with<br>
one or more catalysts for a polycondensation reaction for the production of PET resin is shown by the following examples.<br>
11<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a catalyst composition comprising a titanyl oxalate of the formula XmTiO(C204)2(H20)n, where each X is independently selected from the group consisting of: H, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr , Ba, and ammonium m=l or 2 and from 0.1 to 100 parts of a catalyst enhancer per part of catalyst comprising oxalic or carboxylic acid containing 1 to 26 carbon atoms or their corresponding Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba or ammonium salt.<br>
Examples<br>
[00042]	In a polyester polycondensation reaction,  acetaldehyde (AA) is an<br>
12<br>
undesirable polymerization by-product. Polymerization rate is measured as rate at which intrinsic viscosity (IV) increases during reaction. Intrinsic viscosity change is an indication of the degree of polymerization that has occurred during the reaction.<br><br><br>
Examples 1-20 and  A-G<br>
[00043]	Catalyst evaluation was performed with a 3/16 stainless steel, 2 L reactor,<br>
fitted with a ball valve at the bottom of the reactor. The vessel was equipped with 3 inlet ports, one outlet port, one thermowell port and one pressure transducer port, and was vertically stirred by an electric motor with amperage monitoring. The laboratory experimental were all conducted on a 4.0 mole scale, using as polyester forming reactants, BHET and a normal bottle resin autoclave recipe. The experimental catalysts were added at the time of BHET charging.<br>
[00044]	Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) and catalyst were added to the<br>
reactor and the contents blanketed with nitrogen. The mixtures were heated under reduced<br>
pressure with constant stirring. The ethylene glycol (EG) produced during the<br>
polymerization was removed and trapped. The polymerization was at 280°C , under the<br>
vacuum of typically around 1 torr. The reaction was terminated when the stirrer torque<br>
reached a level, indicated by amperage to the stirrer motor, typical for apolymer of TV -0.6.<br>
The molten state polymer under nitrogen (containing less than 2 ppm of oxygen) blanket<br>
was discharged from the bottom ball valve and quenched into a bucket filled with cold<br>
water. 1/4" diameter and 1/16" thick pellets (for color measurement) were made by filling<br>
the molten polymer in a press molder and chilled immediately in cold water.<br>
[00045]	The solution intrinsic viscosity (IV) was measured by following the ASTM<br>
D 4603 method. Acetaldehyde (AA) was measured at 150°C using gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a headspace analyzer. The brightness (L ) and yellowness (b ) were determined by the Hunter Lab's instrument and method.<br>
[00046]	Twenty-seven examples were performed using the above procedure and<br>
various catalysts and catalyst enhancer amounts.<br>
[00047]	Example A catalyst - 180 ppm potassium oxalate - reaction time =124<br>
mins.<br>
[00048]	Example B catalyst -   2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate -<br>
reaction time = 118 mins.<br>
[00049]	Example C catalyst - 6 ppm titanium potassium titanyl oxalate - reaction<br>
time = 71 mins.<br><br>
[00050]	Example D catalyst - 25 ppm antimony from antimony (HI) oxide - reaction<br>
time =122 mins.<br>
[00051]	Example 1 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm potassium oxalate - reaction time =111 mins.<br>
[00052]	Example 2 catalyst - 90 ppm potassium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from<br>
antimony (III) oxide - reaction time =120 mins.<br>
[00053]	Example 3 catalyst -180 ppm potassium oxalate + 50 ppm antimony from<br>
antimony (HI) oxide - reaction time = 130 mins.<br>
[00054]	Example 4 catalyst - 90 ppm potassium oxalate +100 ppm antimony from<br>
antimony (HI) oxide - reaction time =112 mins.<br>
[00055]	Example 5 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm potassium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from antimony (DI) oxide - reaction time = 105<br>
mins.<br>
[00056]	Example E catalyst - 240 ppm antimony from antimony (DI) oxide - reaction<br>
time = 90 mins.<br>
[00057]	Example F catalyst - 240 ppm antimony from antimony (IH) oxide - reaction<br>
time = 100 mins.<br>
[00058]	Example 6 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm potassium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from antimony (III) oxide - reaction time = 73<br>
mins.<br>
[00059]	Example 7 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm ammonium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from antimony (III) oxide - reaction time = 78<br>
mins.<br>
[00060]	Example 8 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from ammonium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm potassium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from antimony (IH) oxide - reaction time = 79<br>
mins.<br>
[00061]	Example 9 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from ammonium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm ammonium oxalate + 25 ppm antimony from antimony III) oxide - reaction time = 77<br>
mins.<br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
[00073]	Example 20 catalyst - 2 ppm titanium from potassium titanyl oxalate + 90<br>
ppm potassium oxalate +7 ppm germanium from germanium oxide - reaction time =123 minutes.<br>
Example Kesnlts and Dismission<br><br>
[00074]	In comparing examples A, B, C and 1, 180 ppm potassium oxalate alone<br>
produced a polymer with a IV of 0.252 after 124 minutes. Using example B as a baseline, to a polymer with a similar IV, 118 minutes were needed for 2 ppm titanium in potassium titanyl oxalate while only 71 minutes were needed for 6 ppm titanium as shown in example<br>
16<br><br>
C. The addition of potassium oxalate to potassium titanyl oxalate enhanced the rate of<br>
polymerization as can be seen in example 1.<br>
[00075]	In comparing examples A, D, 2, 3,4 E and F, 180 ppm potassium oxalate<br>
alone produced a polymer with an IV of 0.252 after 124 minutes, 25 ppm of antimony in<br>
antimony oxide produced a polymer with an IV of 0.230 after 122 minutes. It is shown in<br>
examples 2, 3, and 4 that the addition of potassium oxalate to antimony enhanced the<br>
polymerization rate, reduced the amount of acetaldehyde, and also increased the brightness<br>
as compared to examples E and F.<br>
[00076]	In comparing examples B and 5, using the combination of potassium titanyl<br>
oxalate, potassium oxalate, and antimony oxide, the polymerization rate was faster, the<br>
acetaldehyde concentration was lower, the resulting polymer was more brighter and less<br>
yellow.<br>
[00077]	In comparing examples 5, E and F, the three component catalyst produced<br>
more brighter and less yellow polymer than antimony oxide. It is conceivable that the rate<br>
for three components  can be further enhanced and the amount of acetaldehyde in the<br>
resulting polymer can be further reduced by adjusting the composition of the three<br>
components.<br>
[00078]	In comparing examples 6 to 9, replacing potassium with ammonium in three<br>
components catalyst reduced the polymerization rate slightly. The resulting polymer by<br>
ammonium containing catalyst was slightly more yellow.<br>
[00079]	In comparing examples 5, 6, 10 to 14, different ligands such as oxalate,<br>
acetate, benzoate, bis 2,2,6,6,-tetramethy-3,5-heptanedionate, i-propoxidate, acetylacetonate<br>
have been used. The catalysts containing these ligands polymerized BHET in a comparable<br>
rate with oxalate containing catalyst. However, the polymers using catalyst containing<br>
ligands rather than oxalate were less bright and more yellow.   Therefore, the oxalate<br>
embodiment of the present invention is preferred over the ligand containing embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
[00080]	In comparing examples 5,15 to 18, although catalysts containing H, Li, Na,<br>
K, and Ca can polymerize BHET in a similar rate, Li containing catalyst produced the least<br>
amount of acetaldehyde in the resulting polymer and are therefore preferred.<br>
