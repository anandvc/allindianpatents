				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a sliding part<br>
for a hermetic compressor, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing a<br>
sliding part for a hermetic compressor that is capable of improving an abrasion<br>
resistance of a sliding part and capable of shortening a manufacturing process.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a general hermetic compressor.<br>
In general, the hermetic compressor includes a hermetic case 6 in which a<br>
suction pipe 2 into which fluid is sucked from an external source and a discharge<br>
pipe 4 for discharging compressed fluid are connected, a drive unit 8 being<br>
disposed at a lower portion of the case 6 and generating a rotational force, and a<br>
compressing unit 10 being disposed at an upper portion of the case 6 and<br>
compressing the fluid according to the rotational force generated by the drive unit<br>
8.<br>
The drive unit 8 includes a stator 12 being disposed fixed at the inner<br>
circumference of the case 6, to which power is applied from an external source, a<br>
rotor 14 being disposed at an inner circumference of the stator 12 with a certain<br>
distance and rotated by electromagnetic interacting with the stator 12 when power<br>
is applied to the stator 12, and a crank shaft 18 being fixed at the rotor 14 and<br>
rotated accordingly and supported at a frame 16 fixed at the case 6.<br>
The compression unit 10 includes a connecting rod 20 being connected to<br>
the upper end of the crank shaft 18 and making a reciprocating and linear<br>
movement according to a rotational movement of the crank shaft 18, a cylinder 22<br>
being disposed fixed at an upper side of the frame 16 and having a space to which<br>
a fluid is provided, a piston 24 being connected to the connecting rod 20 for a<br>
linear movement together with the connecting rod 20, and slidably disposed inside<br>
the cylinder to compress fluid introduced into the cylinder, and a valve assembly<br>
26 being mounted at one side of the cylinder 22 to supply fluid into the cylinder 22<br>
and discharging a coolant compressed by the piston 24.<br>
When such a hermetic compressor is driven for a fluid compression<br>
operation, friction is created between the crank shaft 18 and the frame 16, friction<br>
is created between the piston 24 and the inner wall of the cylinder 22, and friction<br>
is also created between the connecting rod 20 and the crank shaft 18<br>
Thus, the surface of sliding parts where friction is generated is to be<br>
surface-processed to increase lubrication and abrasion resistance.<br>
A method for manufacturing a sliding part of a conventional art will now be<br>
described by taking an example of the piston 24.<br>
The piston is manufactured by using a sintering and casting method for a<br>
mass production.<br>
First, a method for manufacturing the piston 24 by sintering will now be<br>
described with reference to Figure 2.<br>
A material of ferrite group is pressed to form an exterior and subjected to<br>
sintering at a high temperature to obtain a compact organization and increase an<br>
adhesiveness between organizations (step S100).<br>
After the sintering process, a steam treatment is carried out to maintain air<br>
tightness according to closure of pores formed in the organizations of the sintered<br>
product and increase corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance (step S200).<br>
After the steam treatment, a roughing process is performed to process a<br>
shape of an inner and outer diameter (step S300).<br>
After the roughing process, in order to improve a surface roughness of the<br>
sintered product, a sand blasting process is performed (step S400).<br>
After the sand blasting process, in order to improve lubrication and<br>
abrasion resistance on a plastic deformation processed surface, a manganese<br>
phosphate coating treatment, a kind of lubricating treatment, is performed to form<br>
a coated layer 102 (step S500).<br>
After the manganese phosphate coating process, molybdenum disulfide<br>
treatment serving as a lubricant is carried to form a coated layer 104 at the surface<br>
of the piston (step S600).<br>
According to a piston manufacturing method by a casting is that molten<br>
metal having a dissolved ferrite-group material is poured in a molding box to<br>
process a shape of a piston and then the same process as that of the piston<br>
manufacturing method by sintering as described above is performed to finally<br>
manufacture a piston.<br>
The manganese phosphate coating process is a kind of phosphate coating<br>
process and performed for the purpose of a base of a paint, improvement of<br>
abrasion resistance, lubrication of plastic deformation process and electric<br>
insulation, for which phosphate solution of various metals is used suitable to the<br>
purpose.<br>
For the molybdenum desulfide treatment process, a method is used in<br>
which the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is made to be powders or coated on a surface<br>
of the metal by mixing it with grease or oil.<br>
After the piston manufacturing process of the conventional art is<br>
completed, as shown in Figure 3, dual soft-coated layers 102 and 104 are formed<br>
at the surface of the piston by the manganese phosphate and molybdenum<br>
disulfide.<br>
However, the coated layers 102 and 104 of the piston 24, the soft-coated<br>
layer, have a problem that as a predetermined time elapses, a gap (L) is<br>
generated due to a friction according to sliding with the cylinder. 22, into which a<br>
coolant is leaked.<br>
In addition, the conventional method for manufacturing a sliding part for a<br>
hermetic compressor has a problem that since the dual surface treatment process<br>
that the manganese phosphate treatment process and the molybdenum disulfide<br>
treatment process are subsequently performed is carried out, its production cost is<br>
increased, and especially, in case of the molybdenum disulfide surface processing,<br>
its unit cost is so high that its production cost is inevitably increased.<br>
Moreover, because of the dual process performing the manganese<br>
phosphate treatment and the molybdenum disulfide treatment are subsequently<br>
performed, the thickness is increased due to the respective surface processing,<br>
causing exceeding the tolerance and the size deficiency occurs.<br>
That is, When the thickness is increased in the surface treatment process<br>
of the piston, it is difficult to assembly the piston into the cylinder, and the fluid may<br>
be leaked due to the irregular surface of the piston in working.<br>
Furthermore, due to the performing of the dual surface treatment of the<br>
piston, the size is changed when the piston and a piston pin are assembled,<br>
considerably degrading a combination rate, and it is difficult to compute a design<br>
size corresponding to the fact that the piston pin is released from the piston.<br>
In addition, since the surface treatment process of the sliding part is dually<br>
performed, resultantly, the process is complicated, the manufacturing process<br>
duration is increased, and a defective generation rate is increased<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
There may be a plurality of embodiments of the method for manufacturing<br>
a slide part for a hermetic compressor in accordance with the present invention, of<br>
which a preferred embodiment will now be described.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a hermetic compressor of the present invention<br>
includes a hermetic case 6 having a suction tube 2 and a discharge tube 4<br>
attached at one side thereof, a drive unit 8 being inserted at a lower portion of the<br>
case 6 and generating a rotational force, a compression unit 10 being disposed at<br>
an upper side of the case 6, compressing fluid sucked into the suction tube 2<br>
according to the rotational force generated by the drive unit 8 and discharging it to<br>
the discharge tube 4, and a crank shaft 18 generating a driving force generated by<br>
the drive unit 8 to the compression unit 10.<br>
The compression unit 10 includes a connecting rod 20 being connected at<br>
an upper end of the crank shaft 18 and making a reciprocal and linear movement<br>
according to a rotational movement of the crank shaft 18, a cylinder 22 a cylinder<br>
22 being disposed fixed at an upper side of the frame 16 supported by the case 6<br>
and having a space to which a fluid is provided, a piston 24 being connected to the<br>
connecting rod 20 for a linear movement together with the connecting rod 20, and<br>
slidably disposed inside the cylinder to compress fluid introduced into the cylinder,<br>
and a valve assembly 26 being mounted at one side of the cylinder 22 to supply<br>
fluid into the cylinder 22 and discharging a coolant compressed by the piston 24.<br>
As for the sliding part of the hermetic compressor, friction is generated<br>
between the inner wall of the cylinder 22 and the outer circumferential surface of<br>
the piston 24 where the cylinder 22 and the piston 24 are slid, between the inner<br>
wall of the frame 16 and the outer circumferential surface of the crank shaft 18<br>
where the crank shaft 18 is rotatably supported, and at the connecting portion of<br>
the crank shaft 18 and the connecting rod 20.<br>
Such a sliding part are subjected to a surface treatment to increase the<br>
strength and abrasion resistance on the surface thereof. In the present invention,<br>
a surface treating method of the piston, one of sliding parts will now be described.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart of a process for fabricating a sliding part for a<br>
hermetic compressor in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, a powder material of ferrite group is pressurized to form an exterior<br>
of a piston 4, and is sintered at a high temperature to increase its tight coupling in<br>
organization and better its compactness (step S10).<br>
Besides the sintering method for use to form the exterior of the piston 24,<br>
a method for heating and combining powder of ferrite group may be applied and<br>
an alloy obtained by mixing a metal component other than the ferrite group<br>
component can be used as a powder material.<br>
After the sintering is finished, the air pores formed in the organization of the<br>
sintered product are closed and a steam treatment is first performed to maintain air<br>
tightness of the organization and increase a corrosion resistance and an abrasion<br>
resistance (step S20).<br>
The sintered product which has been first steamed is conveyed into a<br>
steam furnace. Steam heated to a temperature higher than a predetermined level<br>
is sprayed to the sintered product, which is conveyed inside the steam furnace, to<br>
close the air pores. That is, spraying steam of high temperature to the sintered<br>
product help oxidize the sintered product and close the air pores, bettering the<br>
airtightness of the sintered product.<br>
The temperature of the sprayed stream is about 500°C~600°C.<br>
When the steam treatment of the sintered product is completed, a<br>
roughing process is performed to form an inner diameter and an outer diameter of<br>
the piston (step S30).<br>
The roughing process is to make a form of an inner and outer diameter<br>
such as the hole of the piston 24 into which a piston pin is to be inserted and an<br>
inner diameter into which the connecting rod 20 is inserted. The roughing process<br>
is performed by using a CNC or an automatic shelf.<br>
After the roughing process is completely performed on the piston, a sand<br>
blasting process is performed to improve a roughness (step S40).<br>
The roughing process-completed piston 24 has a rough surface, so that<br>
when the piston is slid on the inner wall of the cylinder 22, a friction is generated or<br>
airtightness is degraded. In order to solve this problem, the sand blasting process<br>
is performed to super-finish the surface of the piston.<br>
After the sand blasting process is completed, a second steam treatment is<br>
performed to form an oxide coated layer at the surface of the piston 24.<br>
The second steam treatment is performed in a manner that the sand-<br>
blasting-completed piston22 is injected into the steam furnace and passes a<br>
plurality of sections of the steam furnace where steam of above a predetermined<br>
temperature is sprayed so that Fe3O4 hard coated layer is formed at the surface<br>
of the piston 24 to thereby improve the abrasion resistance and corrosion<br>
resistance. At this time, the temperature of the steam is about 500°C~600° like in<br>
the first steam treatment.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart of a process for fabricating a sliding part for a<br>
hermetic compressor in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A method for fabricating a sliding part for a hermetic compressor in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention will now be<br>
described by a method for fabricating the piston 24 by casting.<br>
First, molten metal of ferrite group is poured in a molding box with a<br>
certain form to make a cast in a piston form (step S10).<br>
After the cast is completely manufactured, a roughing process is<br>
performed to form the configuration of an inner diameter and an outer diameter of<br>
the piston 24 (step S20).<br>
After the roughing process is completed, a sand blasting process is<br>
performed to improve a roughness at the surface of the piston 24 (step S30).<br>
After the sand blasting process is completed, a steam treatment is<br>
performing on the surface of the piston 24 to form an oxide coated layer (step<br>
S40).<br>
The steam treatment is performed to form a coated layer on the surface of<br>
the piston 24 for which the sand blasting process has been completed. In the<br>
steam treatment, the piston 24 is injected into the steam furnace and a high<br>
temperature steam of above 400°C is sprayed thereto, so that the oxide coated<br>
layer of Fe3O4 is formed on the surface of the piston 24.<br>
Besides, the piston manufacturing method, other sliding parts such as the<br>
crankshaft and the connecting rod are manufactured in the same manner.<br>
According to a test result, those sliding parts manufactured in accordance<br>
with the embodiment of the present invention exhibit excellent reliability as well as<br>
abrasion resistance and energy consumption efficiency compared to those<br>
manufactured by the existing method.<br>
The test result of the sliding parts of the present invention will now be<br>
described.<br>
Figure 6 is a partial sectional view showing a piston of a hermetic<br>
compressor manufactured according to the manufacturing process in accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A hard coated layer 25 is formed at the surface of the piston manufactured<br>
according to the present invention, so that an abrasion amount according to<br>
friction with respect to the inner wall of the cylinder is very small. Thus, as the<br>
piston is maintained in a closely adhered to the inner side of the cylinder thanks to<br>
the oil film, coolant leakage is minimized.<br>
That is, the abrasion amount due to the friction of the sliding part<br>
manufactured according to the manufacturing method of the present invention is<br>
smaller than the abrasion amount due to friction of the sliding part manufactured<br>
according to the conventional manufacturing method, leakage prevention effect of<br>
the former is remarkably better than the latter.<br>
Figure 7 is a graph showing a comparison of a refrigeration capacity of the<br>
hermetic compressor in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention and that of the conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, there is about 5 Kcal/Hr difference between a<br>
refrigeration capacity (P) of the compressor adopting the sliding part manufactured<br>
by the manufacturing method according to the present invention and that of the<br>
compressor adopting the sliding part manufactured by the conventional<br>
manufacturing method.<br>
Figure 8 is a graph showing a comparison of an electric consumption<br>
amount of the hermetic compressor in accordance with the preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention and that of the conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, there is about 1.5W difference in its input value<br>
between an electricity consumption amount (P) of the compressor adopting the<br>
sliding part manufactured by the manufacturing method according to the present<br>
invention and an electricity consumption amount (Q) of the compressor adopting<br>
the sliding part manufactured by the conventional manufacturing method.<br>
Figure 9 is a graph showing a comparison of an energy consumption<br>
efficiency of the hermetic compressor in accordance with the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention and that of the conventional art.<br>
The energy consumption efficiency is expressed by EER, indicating an<br>
input power-to-refrigeration capacity as a numerical value.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, there is about 0.06EER difference between the<br>
energy consumption efficiency (P) of the present invention and the energy<br>
consumption efficiency (Q) of the conventional art.<br>
That is, increase in the energy consumption efficiency of the present<br>
invention signifies the airtightness and reliability according to the improvement of<br>
the abrasion resistance of the piston.<br>
Figure 10 is a graph showing a comparison of a performance change rage<br>
by oil viscosity of the hermetic compressor in accordance with the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention and that of the conventional art, in which the<br>
horizontal side indicates numerical values by oil viscosity and the vertical side<br>
indicates the energy consumption efficiency.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the compressor adopting the sliding part of the<br>
present invention attains a reliability even when the oil viscosity is in the range of 8<br>
to 10. Thus, since oil with a low viscosity can be adopted for use, the energy<br>
consumption efficiency can be increased as much.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of the conventional art, if oil viscosity is low, since<br>
its reliability is not ensured, a product with viscosity of about 15 is to be used, and<br>
accordingly, its energy consumption efficiency (Q) is degraded as much.<br>
As so far described, the method for manufacturing a sliding part for a<br>
hermetic compressor has many advantages.<br>
That is, for example, first, since the abrasion resistance and corrosion<br>
resistance of the sliding part is increased, the energy consumption efficiency is<br>
improved and the performance of the compressor can be enhanced.<br>
Secondly, since the manufacturing process is shortened, the production<br>
cost can be reduced and the manufacturing time can be reduced.<br>
Thirdly, since the thickness change of the sliding part is minimized, the<br>
defective rate of the part size can be reduced and its quality can be improved.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>

be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims,<br>
and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds<br>
of the claims, or equivalence of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to<br>
be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A method for manufacturing a sliding part for a hermetic<br>
compressor comprising the steps of:<br>
sintering a powder material of a ferrite group and forming a shape of a<br>
sliding part;<br>
performing a first steam treatment to close air pores formed in the<br>
organization of the sliding part after the sintering is finished;<br>
performing a roughing process to form an inner diameter and an outer<br>
diameter of the sliding part after the first steam treatment of the sliding part is<br>
finished;<br>
performing a sand blasting process to improve a surface roughness of<br>
the sliding part after the roughing process is finished; and<br>
performing a second steam treatment to form an oxide coated layer at<br>
the surface of the sliding part after the sand blasting process is finished.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing<br>
a first steam treatment comprises:<br>
conveying the sintering-finished sliding part into a steam furnace; and<br>
spraying steam which has been heated to a certain temperature to the<br>
conveyed sliding part to close the air pores of the sintered product.<br>
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing<br>
a second steam treatment comprises:<br>
conveying the sand blasting-finished sliding part into a steam furnace;<br>
and<br>
spraying steam which has been heated to a certain temperature to the<br>
surface of the conveyed sliding part to form an oxide coated layer on the<br>
surface of the sliding part.<br>
4. The method as claimed in claim 1 to 3, wherein the temperature of<br>
the steam sprayed to the sliding part is about 500°C -600 °C.<br>
5. A method of manufacturing a sliding part for a hermetic<br>
compressorcomprising the steps of:<br>
pouring a molten metal of a ferrite group in a molding box to create a<br>
cast in a certain form;<br>
performing a roughing process to form a shape of an inner diameter and<br>
an outer diameter of a cast product after the cast product is completely<br>
manufactured;<br>
performing a sand blasting process to improve a surface roughness of a<br>
sliding part after the roughing process is finished; and<br>
performing a steam treatment to form an oxide coated layer at the<br>
surface of the sliding part after the roughing process is finished.<br>
6. A method for manufacturing a sliding part for a hermetic<br>
compressor, substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to<br>
Figures 4-6 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Disclosed is a method for manufacturing a sliding part for a hermetic<br>
compressor. The method comprises steps of sintering a powder material of a<br>
ferrite group and forming a shape of a sliding part (S10); performing a first<br>
steam treatment to close air pores formed in the organization of the sliding part<br>
after the sintering is finished (S20); performing a roughing process to form an<br>
inner diameter and an outer diameter of the sliding part after the first steam<br>
treatment (S30); performing a sand blasting process to improve a surface<br>
roughness of the sliding part after the roughing process (S40); and performing a<br>
second steam treatment to form an oxide coated layer at the surface of the<br>
sliding part after the sand blasting process (S50). The sliding part manufactured<br>
by the method can improve the energy consumption efficiency and the<br>
performance of the compressor.</td>
