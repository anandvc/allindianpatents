MTCC  5199  AND  A  METHOD  OF PRODUCING LACTIC ACID;<br>
THE GODAVARI SUGAR MILLS<br>
LIMITED,	A	COMPANY<br>
INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT 1956 WHOSE ADDRESS IS FAZALBHOY BLDG., 45/47, MAHATMA GANDHI ROAD, FORT MUMBAI - 400 001 MAHARASHTRA, INDIA<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The   present  invention   relates  to  a   method   of  producing   lactic   acid   using<br>
Lactobacillus delbureckii.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Lactic acid has long been used as a food additive and in various chemical and<br>
pharmaceutical applications.<br>
The production of lactic acid is commonly carried out by fermentation of a strain of the bacterial genus Lactobacillus, and more particularly, for example, by the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii or Lactobacillus acidophilus.<br>
US Patent 5,416,020 describes a Lactobacillus delbrueckii sub-species bulgaricus ATCC 55163, a strain of Lactobacillus delbureckii subspecies bulgaricus that can produce essentially stereoisometrically pure L- (+) lactic acid and a process for producing essentially stereoisometrically pure L- (+) lactic acid using the strain discloses. A method for producing a mutant strain of Lactobacillus that produces essentially stereoisometrically pure L- (+) lactic acid is also disclosed.<br>
US Patent 5503750 describes a substantial continuous membrane separation process in which the known benefits of cell-recycle fermenter are unexpectedly enhanced because pH is controlled from 4.0 to 5.5 with a nitrogen-containing base. The ammonium lactate formed is not precipitated allowing continuous removal of lactic acid so as to maintain a concentration of lactic acid about 12% by weight in the broth. When combined with recycle of UF retnetate, operating this cell-recycle fermentor allows the build up of a cell population in the range from above 5 x 10 9<br><br>
CFU/ml to 5 x 10 CFU/ml whicn population is much denser than one which can be produced with the specified pH control in a batch fermenter, after self-termination of the fermentation. This super-dense population of cells, in turn not only accelerates production of lactic acid but also minimizes contamination by foreign cells. UF retentate is recycled to produce a specified high fluid velocity when the effluent stream is flowed over UF membranes used in the UF modules. The high fluid velocity at relatively low pressure produces a scrubbing action over the membrane surfaces which are therefore not fouled over long periods of operation. In a batch fermentation with pH control, when the fermentation self-terminated the total lactic acid present is abotu10% by weight measured by HPLC) though free lactic acid is always 
A publication in Journal of Food Sci., Vol 68, No.4, 2003 entitled "Optimization of lactic acid production by Lactobacillus delbrueckii through response surface methodology" by S.J. Tellez-Luis, A.B. Moldes, J.L. Alonso, M. Vazquez. The article describes the optimization through response surface methodology of a low-cost medium based on corn steep liquor (CSL) for lactic acid production by Lactobacillus delbrueckii NRRL B 445. The effect of fermentation time was also considered. A maximum lactic acid concentration (93.4 g/l) was predicted using 15 g of CSL/L and 6g of yeast extract/L at a fermentation time of 80.1 hours. However, the maximum productivity (3.5 g/L/H) was predicted by using 15g of CSL/L, 6 g of yeast extract/L and 8.9 of peptone /L after 24 hours. The publication also suggests that from an economical perspective, better results obtained using 15g CSL/L alone and 24 hours achieving maximum economical productivity of 229.7 g of lactic acid per hour and considerable savings in nutrient.<br><br>
Therefore, it is known that generally, large amounts of lactic acid can be produced by large-scale industrial bacterially-conducted fermentation processes, particularly using carbohydrates, such as dextrose, as the feed stock, along with suitable mineral and amino acid based nutrients. Typically, such productions occur at broth temperatures of at least 45° C, usually around 48° C.<br>
However, in lactic acid fermentation the end-product inhibition by the lactic acid can be a major problem to efficient fermentation. Bacterial strains generally employed in lactate fermentations may be inhibited by low pH in addition to lactate concentration. To overcome this problem, industrial lactate fermentation processes are typically run at a higher pH, at least about 5.0 and often at or above 6.0. This results in the production of a lactate product, which is essentially present in the form of a salt. However, high concentrations of certain salts, e.g., sodium cations, may have an inhibitory effect on fermentation and may influence the efficiency of the fermentation.<br>
The further problems associated with respect to lactic acid production include, downstream isolation and production involving the isolated lactic acid or lactic acid derived product and the yield of the end product.<br>

According to broadest aspect of the invention, a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199 is provided. Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199, a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii is isolated from soil and was deposited at IMTECH. Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199 is a Gram Positive, facultative anaerobe, which<br><br>
is non-motile and non-spore forming, rod shaped.   The cell size is about 0.5-0.8 x<br>
2.0-9.0 mm.<br>
Lactobacillus   delbrueckii   MTCC   5199   is   acid   tolerant   and   possess   strictly<br>
fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major metabolic end product L lactic<br>
acid.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention a process for preparing Lactic acid using Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199 is provided. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the process of preparing lactic acid using Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199 includes the steps where oxygen is purged into the fermenter containing the media to maintain dissolved oxygen content of about 0.55 ppm to about 5.00 ppm.

Characteristic of Lactobacillus delbureckii MTCC 5199<br>
The   micro-organism Lactobacillus delbureckii MTCC 5199     works in both   the<br>
conditions i.e. in aerobic and in anaerobic condition. According to an aspect of the<br>
present invention, cultivation of micro-organism is done in anaerobic condition and<br>
during the   production stage   of the fermentation   media   sterile air is saturated<br>
before inoculation of culture which maintains aerobic condition.<br>

and  when  temperature  reaches  between    60-65  degree C, nutrient media    is<br>
added and aeration is done for 1 hr to maintain   the dissolved oxygen level<br>
from 0.1 to 2ppm.   The   12   hr  old   culture is transferred  to   100 ml   media   and<br>

anaerobic condition in fermenter. The 12 hr old culture is transferred to  100 ml<br>
media and   fermented for 45-60 hours to produce lactic acid.<br>
The rate   of   fermentation is   faster   in    previously   aerated   fermenter   than<br>
anaerobic fermenter. The productivity of lactic acid without aeration is 0.5 gm/lit/hour<br>
and after aeration the productivity is 2gm / L / hour.<br><br>
The Lactobacillus delbrueckii MTCC 5199 grown was transferred to the fermenter. Preferably, the initial sugar concentration in the fermenter was maintained to at about 8 to 12 % w/v. The inoculum volume was about 8 to 12 % of fermenter volume. The pH of the broth was maintained in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 by addition of a base known to a person skilled in the art. Preferably, the base may be ammonium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and the like. The temperature of the fermenter was maintained to about 45 to 55 degree C, preferably at 52 degree C. After 55 hours of conversion, the pH of the fermented broth is adjusted to about 7 to 9, preferably 8.5. The biomass is removed by conventional centrifugation technique. The salt of lactic acid was recovered from the fermenter by methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
