				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to All-IP Wireless Networks. Further, this invention proposes a method to assist in sharing the Network Resources of one operator when other operator's (within the same coverage area) Network resources are exhausted. More particularly, this invention encompasses a method for sharing network resources between two network operators.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Related art does not exist in All-IP Networks. In All-IP networks, IP protocol will be used end-to-end. All information (voice, video and data) will be transmitted over IP protocol whereas the current wireless networks use circuit switching for voice and IP for data.<br>
In current wireless networks the IP is not used end-to-end. Some operators use IP in their core networks. In these wireless networks, the network resources are shared in the form of roaming where the original service provider does not have the presence. For this purpose the service provider (operator) will establish pre-relationship with another operator where the former operator does not have presence.<br>
In All IP networks, if the operator has exhausted all of its resources then it cannot provide services to its subscribers. This operator cannot utilize the<br><br>
resources of another operator in the same region to provide the services to its subscriber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an All-IP network, the mobile network element will be IP enabled. IP network handles the Mobility Management using different techniques. The primary objective of this invention is to invent a method for sharing the network resources of another operator when one operator exhausts its resources. This method treats the change of the operator as mobility issue and allows a user to communicate using another operator's resource.<br>
The invention satisfies the following criteria:<br>
•	Operator will be able to provide the service to its subscriber when it exhausts its resources, using the resources of another operator with whom it has arrangement to the effect.<br>
•	Implementation of this method requires minimal change at the operators end.<br>
•	This method is interoperable with existing standards and is simple and easily deployable.<br>
This invention helps in sharing operator network resources with another operator within the same coverage area. If a user is trying to make a call when his/her operator network is unable to handle the calls (Network Overloaded), the call will be diverted through another operator with whom the former operator has an<br><br>
arrangement to the effect. The user will be provided with the configuration information using which he/she will be connected to the other operator. The problem of sharing bandwidth is raised to Mobility Problem and subsequently Mobile IP techniques will be used to communicate with other CNs using original address/number.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of sharing of the network resource between the operators operating in same area using the mobility management techniques, comprising the steps of:<br>
attheARI:<br>
(a)	on overload and unable to handle condition the user call sending the Rl message to the AR2;<br>
(b)	creating of new address for the user to use at AR2;<br>
(c)	on reception of RIACK sending a Router Advertisement for Redirect message to user (MN); and<br>
(d)	transferring the buffered packets to the user via AR2 on reception of Notify packet from MN/AR2;<br>
at the MN:<br>
(i)       processing of RAR message and make L2 association with the AR2;<br>
(ii)      sending FNA message to the AR2 with the address send by the AR1 in RAR message; and<br>
(iii)      sending the Notify message to AR1 on successful authentication with<br><br>
AR2; at the AR2:<br>
(A)	on reception of Rl, finding the uniqueness of the address mentioned in the Rl message and if the address is not unique find new unique address;<br>
(B)	sending the RIACK message to the AR1 with the unique address that a user can use in the AR2 network;<br>
(C)	processing of FNA message from the user and authenticate the user;<br>
(D)	sending   the   acknowledgement   to   the   user   (MN)   on   successful authentication; and<br>
(E)	sending the Notify message to AR1.<br>
When the service provider gets exhausted with its resources, service provider's Router AR1 diverts the subscriber to another service provider's Router AR2. The user on reception of RAR message does L2 association with AR2 where AR2 authenticates the user and sends the acknowledgement to the user for starting the communication.<br>
After sending the acknowledgement to the user for starting the communication, the user updates HA and CNs with new care of address to achieve route optimization. When AR1 wants to transfer the call to AR2, then AR1 computes the address for user to be used at the AR2 network and sends Rl message to the AR2 with the new address and the security parameters. AR2 checks the uniqueness of the address and if the address is not unique it gets new unique<br><br>
address for the user and sends the RIACK message to AR1. After receiving the RIACK, AR1 updates the user with details of new router and address to be used at new operator.<br>
After updating the user, AR1 starts buffering packets for the MN and AR1 forwards packets to the MN when MN/AR2 send the notify message. Handling the request of user and diverting call to another operator involves a user MN trying to connect/make a call through the AR1 and AR1 determining that the call cannot be handled. AR1 sends a Router Advertisement for Redirect RAR with the Configuration information required at AR2 to MN and the MN on reception of RAR determines that it has to MOVE to another access router AR2 where it configures a new IPv6 address and Security association and Sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement to connect to AR2. MN sends FNA to AR2 and on reception of FNA, AR2 challenges MN request either at L2 association or L3 connectivity using PANA.<br>
After authentication, AR2 grants the connectivity by sending Fast NA Acknowledgement and MN starts communication after receiving the ACK where MN uses MIPv6 to inform the HA and CNs about it new location. Transferring of the call to another operator with the user's detail involves a user MN trying to connect/make a call through the AR1 and determining that the call cannot be handled. AR1 creates new address for the user MN at AR2 and sends Redirect Initiate message with the probable address that is used at AR2 where AR2 sends Rl Ack after confirming the uniqueness of the new address. If the address proposed by AR1 is not unique in new link it sends another new address that can<br><br>
be used. AR1 sends a Router Advertisement for Redirect (RAR) with the Configuration information required at AR2 to MN and the address which is used in another operators network and AR1 buffers the packets for the User MN.<br>
The MN on reception of RAR determines that it has to MOVE to another access router AR2 and it configures a new IPv6 address and Security association and Sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement to connect to AR2. After an authentication AR2 grants the connectivity by sending Fast NA Acknowledgement and MN starts communication after receiving the ACK. MN/AR2 sends Notify to AR1 to forward the packets to MN through AR2 and AR1 transfers all the buffered packets to Mobile Node.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from ensuing the detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Figure 1 shows an All IP network deployment scenario for two service providers. Figure 2 shows an operation of a method at service provider's Router AR1 when it has exhausted its resources and it diverts the subscriber to another service provider's Router AR2. Figure 3 shows an operation of when AR1 transfers the call to the AR2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
In this invention, we propose a method for Sharing Network Resources between two Network Operators. Figure 1 depicts an example deployment scenario for this method. Sharing of the resource of another service provider is treated as an issue of mobility and handled appropriately.<br>
Both the Service Providers make agreement to share the network either mutual sharing or one operator (SP A) sharing the other operator (SP B) resources. SP A configures his network with the configuration information (Prefix to be used at AR2, Security related information etc.)<br>
Figure 1 shows an All IP network deployment scenario for two service providers.<br><br>
Both the service providers cover same geographical area. SP (Service Provider) A and B are the two operators and mobile node is a subscriber of SP A, whose resources are exhausted. Subscriber can be diverted to the SP B as mobility and the resources of SP B will be used by the subscriber of SP A.<br>
Figure 2 shows an operation of a method at service provider's Router AR1 when he is exhausted with the resources and it diverts subscriber to another service provider's Router AR2. The user on reception of RAR message does L2 association with AR2. AR2 authenticate the user and the send the acknowledgement to the user for starting the communication. The user then updates it HA and CNs with new care of address to achieve route optimization.<br>
Figure 3 shows an operation of when AR1 to transfer the call to the AR2. AR1 compute the address for user to be used at the AR2 network and sends Rl message to the AR2 with the new address and the security parameters. AR2 will check the uniqueness of the address, if the address is not unique it tries to get new unique address for the user and send the RIACK message to AR1. After receiving the RIACK, AR1 will update the user with details of new router and address to be used at new operator. AR1 starts buffering packets for the MN and when MN/AR2 send the notify message AR1 forwards packet to the MN.<br>
The following is the step-by-step operation of handling the request of user and diverting call to another operator: (Refer to Figure.2)<br><br>
1.	A user (MN) tries to connect/make a call through the AR1.<br>
2.	AR1 determines that it cannot handle the call.<br>
3.	AR1 sends a Router Advertisement for Redirect (RAR) with the Configuration information required at AR2 to MN.<br>
4.	The MN on reception of RAR determines that it has to MOVE to another access router AR2 it configures a new IPv6 address and Security association and Sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement to connect to AR2.<br>
5.	MN sends FNA to AR2.<br>
6.	On reception of FNA, AR2 challenges MN request either at L2 association or L3 connectivity (using PANA). Contact either SP B's AAA Server (if configured manually) or Contacts SP A's AAA Server<br>
7.	After authentication AR2 grants the connectivity by sending Fast NA Acknowledgement.<br>
8.	MN can start communication after receiving the ACK.<br>
9.	MN uses MIPv6 to inform the HA and CNs about it new location (IPv6 Address).<br>
The following is the step-by-step operation of the invention to transfer the call to another operator with the user's detail: (Refer to Figure.3)<br>
1.	When a user (MN) try to connect/make a call through the AR1.<br>
2.	Determines that it cannot handle the call.<br>
3.	AR1 creates new address for the user (MN) at AR2 and sends Redirect Initiate message with the probable address that will be used at AR2.<br>
4.	AR2 sends Rl Ack after confirming the uniqueness of the new address. If the address proposed by AR1 is not unique in new link it sends another<br><br>
new address that can be used.<br>
5.	AR1 sends a Router Advertisement for Redirect (RAR) with the Configuration information required at AR2 to MN and the address which can be used in the another operators network.<br>
6.	AR1 starts buffering the packets for the User (Mobile Node).<br>
7.	The MN on reception of RAR determines that it has to MOVE to another access router AR2 it configures a new IPv6 address and Security association and Sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement to connect to AR2.<br>
8.	After authentication AR2 grants the connectivity by sending Fast NA Acknowledgement.<br>
9.	MN can start communication after receiving the ACK.<br>
10.MN/AR2 sends Notify to AR1 to forward the packets to MN through AR2. 11. AR1 transfer all the buffered packets to Mobile Node.<br>
Effects / Advantages of the Invention<br>
a.	Operator is able to provide the service to his subscribers using the<br>
resources of another operator with whom he has business agreement,<br>
when it exhausts with its resources.<br>
b.	This method helps one operator handle more number of subscribers in<br>
particular area for shorter time using another operator's resources.<br>
c.	This method does not violate the existing standards.<br>
d.	This method is very easy to implement and requires very minimal<br>
implementation changes to existing equipments.<br><br>
