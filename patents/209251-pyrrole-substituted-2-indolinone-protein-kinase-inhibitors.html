				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates	 certain 3-pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone compounds<br>
which modulate the activity	of protein kinases ("PKs"). The compounds of this<br>
invention   are   therefore   useful   in   treating   disorders   related   to   abnormal<br>
PK activity. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods of<br>
treating diseases utilizing pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of preparing them are also disclosed.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The following is offered as background information only and is not admitted to be prior art to the present invention.<br>
PKs are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. The consequences of this seemingly simple activity are staggering ; cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i. e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore, abnormal<br>
PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer).<br>
The   PKs   can   be   conveniently  broken  down   into  two   classes,<br>
the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the serine-threonine kinases (STKs).<br>
One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors. Growth factor receptors are cell-surface proteins.  When bound by a growth factor ligand, growth factor receptors are converted to an active form which interacts with proteins on the inner surface of a cell membrane. This leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor and other proteins and to the formation inside the cell of complexes with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that, in turn, effect numerous cellular responses such as cell division (proliferation), cell differentiation, cell growth, expression of metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment, etc.  For a more complete discussion, see Schlessinger and Ullrich, Neuron, 9:303-391 (1992) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases ("RTKs").  They comprise a large family of -transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activity.  At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct subfamilies of RTKs have been identified.' An example of these is the subfamily designated the "HER" RTKs, which include EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. These RTKs consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins.<br>
Another RTK subfamily consists of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor related receptor (IRR).  IR and IGF-1R interact with insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II to form a heterotetramer of two entirely extracellular glycosylated a subunits and two P subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyrosine kinase domain.<br>
A third RTK subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor ("PDGFR") group, which includes PDGFRα, PDGFRp, CSFIR, c-kit and c-fms.  These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable numbers of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences.<br>
Another group which, because of its similarity to the PDGFR subfamily, is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase ("flk") receptor subfamily. . This group is believed to be made up of kinase insert domain-receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/FLK-1, VEGF-R2), flk-lR, flk-4 and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-1).<br>
A further member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the fibroblast growth factor ("FGF") receptor subgroup.  This group consists of four receptors, FGFR1-4, and seven ligands, FGF1-7. While not yet well defined, it appears that the receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences.<br>
Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF") receptor subgroup.  VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity in vivo. In particular, VEGF is presently thought to play an essential role is vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.<br>
A more complete listing of the known RTK subfamilies is described in Plowman et al., DN&amp;P, 7(6):334-339 (1994) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br>
In addition to the RTKs, there also exists a family of entirely intracellular PTKs called "non-receptor tyrosine kinases" or "cellular tyrosine kinases."  This latter<br>
designation, abbreviated "CTK," will be used herein.  CTKs do not contain extracellular and transmembrane domains.  At present, over 24 CTKs in 11 subfamilies (Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, Zap70, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak and Ack) have been identified.<br>
The Src subfamily appear so far to be the largest group of CTKs and includes Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk.  For a more detailed discussion of CTKs, see Bolen, Oncogene, 8:2025-2031 (1993), which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br>
The serine/threonine kinases, STKs, like the CTKs, are predominantly intracellular although there are a few receptor kinases of the STK type.  STKs are the most common of the cytosolic kinases; i.e., kinases that perform their function in that part of the cytoplasm other than the cytoplasmic organelles and cytoskelton.  The cytosol is the region within the cell  where much of the cell's intermediary metabolic and biosynthetic activity occurs; e.g., it is in the cytosol that proteins are synthesized on ribosomes.<br>
RTKs, CTKs and STKs have all been implicated in a host of pathogenic conditions including, significantly, cancer.  Other pathogenic conditions which have been associated with PTKs include, without limitation, psoriasis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, angiogenesis, restenosis, ocular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders, immunological disorders such as autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis and a variety of renal disorders.<br>
With regard to cancer, two of the major hypotheses advanced to explain the excessive cellular proliferation that drives tumor development relate to functions known to be PK regulated.  That is, it has been suggested that malignant cell growth results from a breakdown in the mechanisms that control cell division and/or differentiation.  It has been shown that the protein products of a number of proto-oncogenes are involved in the signal transduction  pathways that regulate<br>
cell growth and differentiation.  These protein products of proto-oncogenes include the extracellular growth factors, transmembrane growth factor PTK receptors (RTKs), cytoplasmic PTKs (CTKs) and cytosolic STKs, discussed above.<br>
In view of the apparent link between PK-related cellular activities and wide variety of human disorders, it is no surprise that a great deal of effort is being expended in an attempt to identify ways to modulate PK activity.  Some of this effort has involved biomimetic approaches using large molecules patterned on those involved in the actual cellular processes (e.g., mutant ligands (U.S. App. No. 4,966,849); soluble receptors and antibodies (App. No. WO 94/10202, Kendall and Thomas,. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci., 90:10705-09 (1994), Kim, et al., Nature, 362:841-844 (1993)); RNA ligands (Jelinek, et al., Biochemistry, 33:10450-.56) ; Takano, et al., Mol. Bio. Cell 4:358A (1993); Kinsella, et al., Exp. Cell Res. 199:56-62 (1992); Wright, et al., J. Cellular Phys., 152:448-57) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (WO 94/03427; WO 92/21660; WO 91/15495; WO 94/14808; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992; Mariani, et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 35:2268 (1994)). •<br>
In addition to the above, attempts have been made to identify small molecules which act as PK inhibitors.  For example, bis- monocylic, bicyclic and heterocyclic aryl compounds (PCT WO 92/20642), vinyleneazaindole derivatives (PCT WO 94/14808) and l-cyclopropyl-4-pyridylquinolones (U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992) have been described as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Styryl compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,999), styryl-substituted pyridyl compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,606), quinazoline derivatives (EP App. No.O 566 266 Al),<br>
selenaindoles and selenides (PCT WO 94/03427), tricyclic<br>
polyhydroxylic compounds (PCT WO 92/21660) and<br>
benzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT WO 91/15495) have all been described as PTK inhibitors useful in the treatment of cancer.<br>

The terms "2-indolinone","indolin-2-one" and "2-oxindole" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a molecule having the chemical structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The term "pyrrole" refers to a molecule having the chemical structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The term "pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone" and "3-pyrrolidenyl-2-indolinone" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a chemical compound having the general structure shown in Formula (I).<br>
Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers".   Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers".  When a compound has an •asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible.  An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively).  A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof.  A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".<br>
The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)- stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof.  For example, if the R6 substituent in a compound of formula (I) is 2-hydroxyethyl, then the carbon to which the<br>
hydroxy group is attached is an asymmetric center and therefore the compound of Formula (I) can exist as an (R)- or (S)-stereoisomer.  Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof.  The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992).<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism and structural isomerism.  For example, the compounds described herein may adopt an E or a Z configuration about the double bond connecting the 2-indolinone moiety to the pyrrole moiety or they may be a mixture of E and Z. This invention encompasses any tautomeric or structural isomeric form and mixtures thereof which possess the ability to modulate RTK, CTK and/or STK activity and is not limited to any one tautomeric or structural isomeric form.<br>
A "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a mixture of one or more of the compounds described herein, or physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components, such as physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.  The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.<br>
The compound of Formula (I) may also act as a prodrug. A "prodrug" refers to an agent which is converted into the parent drug in vivo.  Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug.  They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate<br>
transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial.<br>
A further example of a prodrug might be a short polypeptide, for example, without limitation, a 2 - 10 amino acid polypeptide, bonded through a terminal amino group to a carboxy group of a compound of this invention wherein the polypeptide is hydrolyzed or metabolized in vivo to release the active molecule. The prodrugs of a compound of Formula (I) are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Additionally, it is contemplated that a compound of Formula (I) would be metabolized by enzymes in the body of the organism such as human being to generate a metabolite that can modulate the activity of the protein kinases.  Such metabolites are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As used herein, a "physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier or diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound.<br>
An "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of a compound.  Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which retain, the biological effectiveness and properties of the parent compound. Such salts include:<br>
(i)  acid addition salt which is obtained by reaction of the free base of the parent compound with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and perhcloric acid and the<br>
like, or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, (D) or (L) malic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid and the like, preferably hydrochloric acid or (L)-malic acid such as the L-malate salt of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid(2-diethylaminoethyl) amide; or<br>
(2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-rriethylglucamine, and the like.<br>
"PK" refers to receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RTKs), non-receptor or "cellular" tyrosine kinase (CTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs).<br>
"Method" refers to manners, means, techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including, but not limited to, those manners, means, techniques and procedures either known to, or readily developed from known manners, means, techniques and procedures by, practitioners of the chemical, pharmaceutical, biological, biochemical and medical arts.<br>
"Modulation" or "modulating" refers to the alteration of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.  In particular, modulating refers to the activation of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, preferably the activation or inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, depending on the concentration of the compound or salt to which the RTK, CTK or STK is exposed or, more preferably, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.<br>
"Catalytic activity" refers to the rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine under the influence, direct or indirect, of RTKs and/or CTKs or the phosphorylation of serine and threonine under the influence, direct or indirect, of STKs.<br>
"Contacting" refers to bringing a compound of this invention<br>
  and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PK, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such "contacting" can be accomplished "in vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PK of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment.  In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC50 of the compound, defined below, can be determined before use of the compounds in vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted.  For cells outside the organism, multiple methods exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to get the PKs in contact with the compounds including, but not limited to, direct cell microinjection and numerous transmembrane carrier techniques.<br>
"In vitro" refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium.<br>
"In vivo" refers to procedures performed within a living organism such as, without limitation, a mouse, rat or rabbit.<br>
"PK related disorder," "PK driven disorder," and "abnormal PK activity" all refer to a condition characterized by inappropriate, i.e., under or, more commonly, over, PK catalytic activity, where the particular PK can be an RTK, a CTK or an STK.  Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PK expression in cells which normally do not express PKs, (2) increased PK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PK refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PK or production of a level of PK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases).  Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PK activity decreases.<br>
"Treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms.  With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced. "Organism" refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell.  A living organism can be as simple as, for example, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated.  In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has the effect of:<br>
(1)	reducing the size of the tumor;.<br>
(2)	inhibiting (that is, slowing to some<br>
extent,preferably stopping) tumor metastasis;<br>
(3)	inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some<br>
extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and/or,<br>
(4)	relieving to some extent (or, preferably,<br>
eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with<br>
the cancer.<br>
"Monitoring" means observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PK. The observed or detected effect can be a change in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PK or a change in the interaction of a PK with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-<br>
known in the art.<br>
The above-referenced effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.<br>
"Cell phenotype" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use.  Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techniques well-known in the art.<br>
"Natural binding partner" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PK in a cell.  Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PK-mediated signal transduction process.  A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PK can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PK to mediate signal transduction.<br>

Utility<br>
The PKs whose catalytic activity is modulated by the compounds of this invention include protein tyrosine kinases  , of which there are two types, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cellular tyrosine kinases (CTKs), and serine-threonine kinases (STKs).  RTK mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity<br><br>
and phosphorylation.  Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response (e.g., cell division, metabolic effects on the extracellular microenvironment, etc.).  See, Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron 9:303-391.<br>
It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation sites on growth factor receptors function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Fantl et al., 1992, Cell 69:413-423, Songyang et al., 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:2777-2785), Songyang et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778, and Koch et al., 1991, Science 252:668-678. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with RTKs have been identified. They may .be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates that have a catalytic domain, and (2) substrates which lack such domain but which serve as adapters and associate with catalytically active molecules. Songyang et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778.  The specificity of the interactions between receptors and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains, and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their substrate phosphorylation profiles.  Songyang et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778.  These observations suggest that the function of each RTK is determined not only by its pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor.  Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors.<br>
STKs, being primarily cytosolic, affect the internal biochemistry of the cell, often as a down-line response to a PTK event.  STKs have been implicated in the signaling process which initiates DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis leading to cell proliferation.<br>
Thus, PK signal transduction results in, among other responses, cell proliferation, differentiation, growth and metabolism.  Abnormal cell proliferation may result in a wide array of disorders and diseases, including the development of neoplasia such as carcinoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma and hemangioma, disorders such as leukemia, psoriasis, arteriosclerosis, arthritis and diabetic retinopathy and other disorders related to uncontrolled angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis.<br>
A precise understanding of the mechanism by which the compounds of this invention inhibit PKs is not required in order to practice the present invention.  However, while not hereby being bound to any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that the compounds interact with the amino acids in the catalytic region of PKs.  PKs typically possess a bi-lobate structure wherein ATP appears to bind in the cleft between the two lobes in a region where the amino acids are conserved among PKs.  Inhibitors of PKs are believed to bind by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and ionic interactions in the same general region where the aforesaid ATP binds to the PKs.  More specifically, it is thought that the 2-indolinone component of the compounds of this invention binds in the general space normally occupied by the adenine ring of ATP.  Specificity of a particular molecule for a particular PK may then arise as the result of additional interactions between the various substituents on the 2-indolinone core and the amino acid domains specific to particular PKs.  Thus, different indolinone substituents may contribute to preferential binding to particular PKs.  The ability to select compounds active at different ATP (or other nucleotide) binding sites makes the compounds of this<br>
invention useful for targeting any protein with such a site. The compounds disclosed herein thus have utility in in vitro assays for such proteins as well as exhibiting in vivo therapeutic effects through interaction with such proteins.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of the present invention provide a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors, including but not limited to carcinomas, sarcomas including Kaposi's sarcoma, erythroblastoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, melanoma and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non-solid tumor cancers such as leukemia are also contemplated by this invention.  Indications may include, but are not limited to brain cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, gastric cancers, pancreas cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers.<br>
Further examples, without limitation, of the types of disorders related to inappropriate PK activity that the compounds described herein may be useful in preventing, treating and studying, are cell proliferative disorders, fibrotic disorders and metabolic disorders.<br>
Cell proliferative disorders, which may be prevented, treated or further studied by the present invention include cancer, blood vessel proliferative disorders and mesangial cell proliferative disorders.<br>
Blood vessel proliferative disorders refer to disorders related to abnormal vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation) and angiogenesis (spreading of blood vessels). While vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, corpus luteum formation, wound healing and organ regeneration, they also play a pivotal role in cancer development where they result in the formation of new capillaries needed to keep a tumor alive.  Other examples of blood vessel proliferation disorders include arthritis, where new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage, and ocular diseases, like diabetic retinopathy, where new capillaries in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed and cause blindness.<br>
Two structurally related RTKs have been identified to bind VEGF with high affinity: the fms-like tyrosine 1 (fit-1) receptor (Shibuya et al., 1990, Oncogene,5;519-524; De Vries et al., 1992, Science, 255:989-991) and the KDR/FLK-1 receptor, also known as VEGF-R2.  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported to be an endothelial cell specific mitogen with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity. Ferrara &amp; Henzel, 1989, Biochein. Biophys. Res. Comm., 161:851-858; Vaisman et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265:19461-19566. Information set forth in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 08/193,829, 08/038,596 and 07/975,750, strongly suggest that VEGF is not only responsible for endothelial cell proliferation, but also is the prime regulator of normal and pathological angiogenesis. See generally, Klagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993, Current Biology, 3(10)699-702; Houck, et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267:26031-26037.<br>
Normal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of physiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, organ regeneration and female reproductive processes such as follicle development in the corpus luteum during ovulation and placental growth after pregnancy. Folkman &amp; Shing, 1992, J. Biological Chem., 267(16):10931-34. Uncontrolled vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis has been associated with diseases such as diabetes as well as with malignant solid tumors that rely on vascularization for growth. Klagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993", Current Biology, 3(10):699-702; Folkham, 1991, J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,<br>
82:4-6; Weidner, et al., 1991, New Engl. J. Med., 324:1-5.<br><br>
The surmised role of VEGF in endothelial cell proliferation and migration during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis indicates an important role for the KDR/FLK-1 receptor in these processes.

University Press, Leuven) and arthritis, as well as malignant tumor growth may result from uncontrolled angiogenesis. See e.g., Folkman, 1971, N. Enql. J. Med., 285:1182-1186. The receptors to which VEGF specifically binds are an important and powerful therapeutic target for the regulation and modulation of vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis and a va-riety of severe diseases which involve abnormal cellular growth caused by such processes. Plowman, et al. 1994, DN&amp;P, 7(6):334-339. More particularly, the KDR/FLK-1 receptor's highly specific role in neovascularization make it a choice target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer and other diseases which involve the uncontrolled formation of blood vessels.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides compounds capable of regulating and/or modulating tyrosine kinase signal transduction including KDR/FLK-1 receptor signal transduction in order to inhibit or promote angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis, that is, compounds that inhibit, prevent, or interfere with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-1 when activated by ligands such as VEGF. Although it is believed that the compounds of the present invention act on a receptor or other component along the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway, they may also act directly on the tumor cells that result from uncontrolled angiogenesis.<br>
Although the nomenclature of the human and murine counterparts of the generic "flk-I" receptor differ, they are, in many respects, interchangeable. The murine receptor, Flk-1, and its human counterpart, KDR, share a sequence homology of 93.4% within the intracellular domain. Likewise, murine FLK-I binds human VEGF with the same affinity as mouse VEGF, and accordingly, is activated by the ligand derived from either species. Millauer et al., 1993, Cell, 72:835-846; Quinn et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7533-7537. FLK-1 also associates with and subsequently tyrosine phosphorylates human RTK substrates (e.g., PLC-y or p85) when co-expressed in 293 cells (human embryonal kidney fibroblasts).<br>
Models which rely upon the FLK-1 receptor therefore are directly applicable to understanding the KDR receptor. For example, use of the murine FLK-1 receptor in methods which identify compounds that regulate the murine signal transduction pathway are directly applicable to the identification of compounds which may be used to regulate the human signal transduction pathway, that is, which regulate activity related to the KDR receptor. Thus, chemical compounds identified as inhibitors of KDR/FLK-1 in vitro, can be confirmed in suitable in vivo models. Both in vivo mouse and rat animal models have been demonstrated to be of excellent value for the examination of the clinical potential of agents acting on the KDR/FLK-1 induced signal transduction pathway.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides compounds that regulate, modulate and/or inhibit vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis by affecting the enzymatic activity of the KDR/FLK-1 receptor and interfering with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-1. Thus the present invention provides a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors including, but not limited to, glioblastoma, melanoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and ovarian, lung, mammary, prostate, pancreatic, colon and epidermoid carcinoma. In addition, data suggests the administration of compounds which inhibit the KDR/Flk-1 mediated signal transduction pathway may also be used in the treatment" of hemangioma, restenois and diabetic retinopathy.<br>
Furthermore, this invention relates to the inhibition of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis by other receptor-mediated pathways, including the pathway comprising the flt-1 receptor.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules which leads to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic<br>
signalling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response, e.g., cell division and metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment. See, Schlessinger and Ullrich,<br>
1992,	Neuron, 9:1-20.<br>
The close homology of the intracellular regions of KDR/FLK-1 with that of the PDGF-0 receptor (50.3% homology) and/or the related flt-1 receptor indicates the induction of overlapping signal transduction pathways. For example, for the PDGF-p receptor, members of the src family (Twamley et al.,<br>
1993,	Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7696-7700),<br>
phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (Hu et al., 1992, Mol. Cell.<br>
Biol., 12:981-990), phospholipase cry (Kashishian &amp; Cooper,<br>
1993,	Mol. Cell. Biol., 4:49-51), ras-GTPase-activating<br>
protein, (Kashishian et al., 1992, EMBO J., 11:1373-1382),<br>
PTP-ID/syp (Kazlauskas et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA, 10 90:6939-6943), Grb2 (Arvidsson et al., 1994, Mol.<br>
Cell. Biol., 14:6715-6726), and the adapter molecules She and<br>
Nek (Nishimura et al., 1993, Mol. Cell. Biol., 13:6889-6896),<br>
have been shown to bind to regions involving different<br>
autophosphorylation sites. See generally, Claesson-Welsh,<br>
1994,	Prog. Growth Factor Res., 5:37-54. Thus, it is likely<br>
that signal transduction pathways activated by KDR/FLK-1<br>
include the ras pathway (Rozakis et al., 1992, Nature,<br>
360:689-692), the PI-3'-kinase, the src-mediated and the plcy-<br>
mediated pathways. Each of these pathways may play a critical<br>
role in the angiogenic and/or vasculogenic effect of KDR/FLK-1<br>
in endothelial cells. Consequently, a still further aspect of<br>
this invention relates to the use of the organic compounds<br>
described herein to modulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis<br>
as such processes are controlled by these pathways.<br>
Conversely, disorders related to the shrinkage, contraction or closing of blood vessels, such as restenosis, are also implicated and may be treated or prevented by the methods of this invention.<br>
Fibrotic disorders refer to the abnormal formation of extracellular matrices.  Examples of fibrotic disorders<br>
include hepatic cirrhosis and mesangial cell proliferative disorders.  Hepatic cirrhosis is characterized by the increase in extracellular matrix constituents resulting in the formation of a hepatic scar. An increased extracellular matrix resulting in a hepatic scar can also be caused by a viral infection such as hepatitis.  Lipocytes appear to play a major role in hepatic cirrhosis.  Other fibrotic disorders implicated include atherosclerosis.<br>
Mesangial cell proliferative disorders refer to disorders brought about by abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells. Mesangial proliferative disorders include various human renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and malignant nephrosclerosis as well as such disorders as thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies. The RTK PDGFR has been implicated in the maintenance of mesangial cell proliferation.  Floege et al., 1993, Kidney International 43;47S-54S.<br>
Many cancers are cell proliferative disorders and, as noted previously, PKs have been associated with cell proliferative disorders.  Thus, it is not surprising that PKs such as, 'for example, members of the RTK family have been associated with the development of cancer.  Some of these receptors, like EGFR (Tuzi et al., 1991, Br. J. Cancer 63:227-233, Torp et al., 1992, APMI5 100:713-719) HER2/neu (Slamon et al., 1989, Science 244:707-712) and PDGF-R (Kumabe et al., 1992, Oncogene, 7:627-633) are over-expressed in many tumors and/or persistently activated by autocrine loops.  In fact, in the most common and severe cancers these receptor over-expressions (Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., 1992, £._<br>
Neurol. Sci., 111:119-133, Dickson et al., 1992, Cancer<br>
.      '	!<br>
Treatment Res. 61:249-273, Korc et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest.<br>
90:1352-1360) and autocrine loops (Lee and Donoghue, 1992, J,_ Cell. Biol., 118:1057-1070, Korc et al., supra, Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., supra) have been demonstrated.  For example, EGFR has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer,<br>
lung cancer and bladder cancer.  HER2 has been associated with breast, ovarian, gastric, lung, pancreas and bladder cancer. PDGFR has been associated with glioblastoma and melanoma as well as lung, ovarian and prostate cancer.  The RTK c-met has also been associated with malignant tumor formation.  For example, c-met has been associated with, among other cancers, colorectal, thyroid, pancreatic, gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphomas. Additionally c-met has been linked to leukemia.  Over-expression of the c-met gene has also been detected in patients with Hodgkins disease and Burkitts disease.<br>
IGF-IR, in addition to being implicated in nutritional support and in type-II diabetes, has also been associated with several types of cancers.  For example, IGF-I has been implicated as an autocrine growth stimulator for several tumor types, e.g. human breast cancer carcinoma cells (Arteaga et al., 1989, J Clin. Invest. 84:1418-1423) and small lung tumor cells (Macauley et al., 1990, Cancer Res., 50:2511-2517).  In addition, IGF-I, while integrally involved in the normal growth and differentiation of the nervous system, also appears to be an autocrine stimulator of human gliomas.  Sandberg-Nordqvist et al., 1993, Cancer Res. 53:2475-2478.  The importance of IGF-IR and its ligands in cell proliferation is further supported by the fact that many cell types in culture (fibroblasts, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, T-lymphocytes, myeloid cells, chondrocytes and osteoblasts (the stem cells of the bone marrow)) are stimulated to grow by IGF-I.  Goldring and Goldring, 1991, Eukaryotic Gene Expression,1:301-326. Baserga and Coppola suggest that IGF-IR plays a central role in the mechanism of transformation and, as such, could be a preferred target for therapeutic interventions for a broad spectrum of human malignancies.  Baserga, 1995, Cancer Res., 55:249-252,  Baserga, 1994, Cell 79:927-930,  Coppola et al., 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol., 14:4588-4595.<br>
STKs have been implicated in many types of cancer including, notably, breast cancer (Cance, et al.. Int. J.<br>
Cancer, 54:571-77 (1993)).<br>
The association between abnormal PK activity and disease is not restricted to cancer.  For example, RTKs have been associated with diseases such as psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, endometriosis, angiogenesis, atheromatous plaque development, Alzheimer's disease, restenosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, epidermal hyperproliferation, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related macular degeneration and hemangiomas.  For example, EGFR has been indicated in corneal and dermal wound healing. Defects in Insulin-R and IGF-1R are indicated in type-II diabetes mellitus. A more complete correlation between specific RTKs and their therapeutic indications is set forth in Plowman et al., 1994, DN&amp;P 7:334-339.<br>
As noted previously, not only RTKs but CTKs including, but not limited to, src, abl, fps, yes, fyn, lyn, Ick, blk, hck, fgr and yrk (reviewed by Bolen et al., 1992, FASEB J., 6:3403-3409) are involved in the proliferative and metabolic signal transduction pathway and thus could be expected, and have been shown, to be involved in many PTK-mediated disorders to which the present invention is directed.  For example, mutated src (v-src) has been shown to be an oncoprotein (pp60v-src) in chicken. Moreover, its cellular homolog, the proto-oncogene pp60c-src transmits oncogenic signals of many receptors.  Over-expression of EGFR or HER2/neu in tumors leads to the constitutive activation of pp60c-src, which is characteristic of malignant cells but absent in normal cells.  On the other hand, mice deficient in the expression of c-src exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype, indicating a key participation of c-src in osteoclast function and a possible involvement in related disorders.<br>
Similarly, Zap70 has been implicated in T-cell signaling which may relate to autoimmune disorders.<br>
STKs have been associated with inflamation, autoimmune disease, immunoresponses, and hyperproliferation disorders such as restenosis, fibrosis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
PKs have also been implicated in embryo implantation. Thus, the compounds of this invention may provide an effective method of preventing such embryo implantation and thereby be useful as birth control agents. Additional disorders which may be treated or prevented using the compounds of this invention are immunological disorders such as autoimmune disease, AIDS and cardiovasular disorders such as atherosclerosis.<br>
Finally, both RTKs and CTKs are currently suspected as being involved in hyperimmune disorders.<br>
Examples of the effect of a number of exemplary compounds of this invention on several PTKs are shown in Table 2 below. The compounds and data presented are not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Administration and Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
A compound of the present invention or a<br>
phearmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered as such to a human patient or can be administered in pharmaceutical compositions in which the foregoing materials are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s) .  Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmacological Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA., latest edition.<br>
As used herein, "administer" or "administration" refers to the delivery of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or of a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of this invention to an organism for the purpose of prevention or treatment of a PK-related disorder.<br>
Suitable routes of administration may include, without limitation, oral, rectal, transmucosal or intestinal administration or intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intravitreal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular<br>
injections.  The preferred routes of administration are oral<br>
and parenteral.<br>
Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local<br>
rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the<br>
compound directly into a solid tumor, often in a depot or<br>
sustained release formulation.<br>
Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted<br>
drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with<br>
tumor-specific antibody.  The liposomes will be targeted to<br>
and taken up selectively by the tumor.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may<br>
be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or<br>
lyophilizing processes.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.  Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer.  For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation.  Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art.  Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, lozenges, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient.  Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be<br>
made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding other suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.  Useful excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol, cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch and potato starch and other materials such as gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl- cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl- pyrrolidone (PVP).  If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid. A salt such as sodium alginate may also be used.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings.  For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures.  Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as -well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol.  The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with a filler such as lactose, a binder such as starch, and/or a lubricant such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers.  In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols.  Stabilizers may be added in these formulations, also.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which may also be used include hard gelatin capsules.  As a non-limiting example, the active compound capsule oral drug product formulation may be<br>
as 50 and 200 mg dose strengths (formulation codes J-011248-AA-00 and J-011248-AA-01, respectively).  The two dose strengths are made from the same granules by filling into different size hard gelatin capsules, size 3 for the 50 mg capsule and size 0 for the 200 mg capsule.  The composition of the formulation may be, for example, as indicated in Table 2.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The capsules may be packaged into brown glass or plastic bottles to protect the active compound from light.  The containers containing the active compound capsule formulation must be stored at 'controlled room temperature (15-30°C).<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetra- fluoroethane or carbon dioxide.  In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be controlled by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.  Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin for use in an inhaler or<br>
insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.  The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating materials such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of a water soluble form, such as, without limitation, a salt, of the active compound. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a lipophilic vehicle.  Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes.  Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran.  Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers and/or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal • compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g.,. conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the fomulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations.  Such . long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection.  A compound of this invention may be<br><br>
formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for instance, in an emulsion with a pharamcologically acceptable oil), with ion exchange resins, or as a sparingly soluble derivative such as, without limitation, a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
A non-limiting example of a pharmaceutical carrier for the hydrophobic compounds of the invention is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer and an aqueous phase such as the VPD co-solvent system.  VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol.  The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:D5W) consists of VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution.  This Co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of such a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics.  Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of Polysorbate 80, the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied, other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed.  Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs.  In addtion, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although often at the cost of greater toxicity.<br>
Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art.  Sustained-release<br>
capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days.  Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients.  Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Many of the PK modulating compounds of the invention may be provided as physiologically acceptable salts wherein the claimed compound may form the negatively or the positively charged species.  Examples of salts in which the compound forms the positively charged moiety include, without limitation, quaternary ammonium (defined elsewhere herein) , salts such as the hydrochloride, sulfate, carbonate, lactate, tartrate, malate, maleate, succinate wherein the nitrogen atom of the quaternary ammonium group is a nitrogen of the selected compound of this invention which has reacted with the appropriate acid. Salts in which a compound of this invention forms the negatively charged species include, without limitation, the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid group in the compound with an appropriate base (e.g. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2)/ etc.).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose, e.g., the modulation of PK activity or the treatment or prevention of a PK-related disorder.<br>
More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or<br>
ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.<br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br>
For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays.  Then, the dosage can be formulated for use in animal models so as to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the PK activity).  Such information can then be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the IC50 and the LD50 (both of which are discussed elsewhere herein) for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.  The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition.  (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.1).<br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active species which are sufficient to maintain the kinase modulating effects. These plasma levels are referred to as minimal effective concentrations (MECs).  The MEC will vary for each compound out can be estimated from in vitro data, e.g., the concentration necessary to achieve 50-90% inhibition of a kiinase may be ascertained using the assays described herein.<br>
Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.<br>
Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compounds should be administered using a regimen that maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%.<br>
At present, the therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of Formula (I) may range from approximately 25 mg/m2 to 1500 mg/m2 per day; preferably about 3 mg/m2/day. Even more preferably 50mg/qm qd till 400 mg/qd.<br>
In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration and other procedures known in the art may be employed to determine the correct dosage amount and interval.<br>
The amount of a composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br>
The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient.  The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack.  The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of Pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or of human or veterinary administration.  Such notice, for example, may be of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert.  Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier<br>
may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.  Suitable conditions indicated on the label may include treatment of a tumor, inhibition of angiogenesis, treatment of fibrosis, diabetes, and the like.<br>
It is also an aspect of this invention that a compound described herein, or its salt or prodrug, might be combined with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of the diseases and disorders discussed above.  For instance, a compound, salt or prodrug of this invention might be combined with alkylating agents such as fluorouracil (5-FU) alone or in further combination with leukovorin; or other alkylating agents such as, without limitation, other pyrimidine analogs such as UFT, capecitabine, gemcitabine and cytarabine, the alkyl sulfonates, e.g., busulfan (used in the treatment of chronic granulocytic leukemia), improsulfan and piposulfan; aziridines, e.g., benzodepa, carboquone, meturedepa and uredepa; ethyleneimines and methylmelamines, e.g., altretamine, triethylenemelamine, triethylenephosphoramide, triethylenethiophosphoramide and trimethylolmelamine; and the nitrogen mustards, e.g., chlorambucil (used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary macroglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), cyclophosphamide (used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, Wilm's tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma), estramustine, ifosfamide, novembrichin, prednimustine and uracil mustard (used in the treatment of primary thrombocytosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and ovarian cancer); and triazines, e.g., dacarbazine (used in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma).<br>
A compound, salt or prodrug of this invention can also be used in combination with other antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agents such as, without limitation, folic acid analogs, e.g. methotrexate (used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, choriocarcinoma, mycosis fungiodes breast cancer, head and neck cancer and osteogenic sarcoma) and pteropterin;<br>

General Synthetic Procedure.<br>
The following general methodology may be employed to prepare the compounds of this invention:<br>
The appropriately substituted 2-oxindole (1 equiv.), the appropriately substituted aldehyde (1.2 equiv) and a base (0.1 equiv.) are mixed in a solvent (1-2 ml/mmol 2-oxindole) and the mixture is then heated for from about 2 to about 12 hours.  After cooling, the precipitate that forms is filtered, washed with cold ethanol or ether and vacuum dried to give the solid product.  If no precipitate forms, the reaction mixture is concentrated and the residue is triturated with dichloromethane/ether, the resulting solid is collected by filtration and then dried.  The product may optionally be further purified by chromatography.<br>
The base may be an organic or an inorganic base.  If an organic base is used, preferably it is a nitrogen base. Examples of organic nitrogen bases include, but are not limited to, diisopropylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, aniline, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.1]undec-7-ene, pyrrolidine and piperidine.<br>
Examples of inorganic bases are, without limitation, ammonia, alkali metal or alkaline earth hydroxides, phosphates, carbonates, bicarbonates, bisulfates and amides.  The alkali metals include, lithium, sodium and potassium while the alkaline earths include calcium, magnesium and barium.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, when-the solvent is a protic solvent, such as water or alcohol, the base is an alkali metal or an alkaline earth inorganic base, preferably, a alkali metal or an alkaline earth hydroxide.<br>
It will be clear to those skilled in |the art, based both on known general principles of organic synthesis and on the disclosures herein which base would be most appropriate for the reaction contemplated.<br>
The solvent in which the reaction is carried out may be a protic or an aprotic solvent, preferably it is a protic solvent. A "protic solvent" is a solvent which has hydrogen atom(s)<br>
covalently bonded to oxygen or nitrogen atoms which renders the hydrogen atoms appreciably acidic and thus capable of being "shared" with a solute through hydrogen bonding.  Examples of protic solvents include, without limitation, water and alcohols.<br>
An "aprotic solvent" may be polar or non-polar but, in either case, does not contain acidic hydrogens and therefore is not capable of hydrogen bonding with solutes. Examples, without limitation, of non-polar aprotic solvents, are pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride. Examples of polar aprotic solvents are chloroform, tetrahydro-furan, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the solvent is a protic solvent, preferably water or an alcohol such as ethanol.<br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures greater than room temperature.  The temperature is generally from about 30° C to about 150° C, preferably about 80°C to about 100° C, most preferable about 75° C to about 85° C, which is about the boiling point of ethanol.  By "about" is meant that the temperature range is preferably within 10 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature, more preferably within 5 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature and, most preferably, within 2 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature.  Thus, for example, by "about 75° C" is meant 75° C ± 10° C, preferably 75° C ± 5° C and most preferably, 75° C ± 2° C.<br>
2-Oxindoles and aldehydes, may be readily synthesized using techniques well known in the chemical arts. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other synthetic pathways for forming the compounds of the invention are available and that the following is offered by way of example and not limitation.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
The following assays are employed to find those compounds demonstrating the optimal degree of the desired activity. A.   Assay Procedures.<br>
The following assays may be used to determine the level of activity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention on one or more of the PKs.  Similar assays can be designed along the same lines for any PK using techniques well known in the art.<br>
Several of the assays described herein are performed in an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Sandwich Assay) format (Voller, et al., 1980, "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,"<br>
Manual of Clinical Immunology, 2d ed., Rose and Friedman, Am. Soc. Of Microbiology, Washington, D.C., pp. 359-371). The general procedure is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added.  The cells are lysed and the lysate is transferred to the wells of an ELISA plate previously coated with a specific antibody recognizing the substrate of the enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Non-substrate components of the cell lysate are washed away and the amount of phosphorylation on the substrate is detected with an antibody specifically recognizing phosphotyrosine compared with control cells that were not contacted with a test compound.<br>
The presently preferred protocols for conducting the ELISA experiments for specific PKs is provided below. However, adaptation of these protocols for determining <br>
activity of compounds against other RTKs, as well as for CTKs and STKs, is well within the scope of knowledge of those skilled in the art.  Other assays described herein measure the amount of DNA made in response to activation of a test kinase, which is a general measure of a proliferative response.  The general procedure for this assay is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinas.e, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if .the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. After incubation at least overnight, a DNA labeling reagent such as 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or H3-thymidine is added. The amount of labeled DNA is detected with either an anti-BrdU antibody or by measuring radioactivity and is compared to control cells not contacted with a test compound. GST-FLK-1 BIOASSAY<br>

ml assay medium/15 cm2 of tissue culture flask.  Assay medium<br>
consists of F12K medium (Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 21127-014)<br>
and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine, serum.  Count the cells<br>
with a Coulter Counter® (Coulter Electronics, Inc.) and add<br>
assay medium to the cells to obtain a concentration of 0.8-1.0<br>
x 10s cells/ml.<br>
3.	Add cells to 96-well flat-bottom plates at 100<br>
µL/well or 0.8-1.0 x 105 cells/well, incubate -24h at 37°C, 5%<br>
C02.<br>
DAY 1<br>
1.   Make up two-fold test compound titrations in separate 96-well plates, generally 50 µM on down to 0 µM.  Use the same assay medium as mentioned in day 0, step 2 above. Titrations are made by adding 90 µL/well of test compound at 200 nM (4X the final well concentration) to the top well of a particular plate column.  Since the stock test compound is usually 20 mM in DMSO, the 200 µM drug concentration contains 2% DMSO.<br>
A diluent made up to 2% DMSO in assay medium (F12K +0.5%<br>
titrations in order to dilute the test compound but keep the DMSO concentration constant.  Add this diluent to the remaining wells in the column at 60 ul/well.  Take 60 ul from the 120 ul of 200 µM test compound dilution in the top well of the column and mix with the 60 ul in the second well of the column.  Take 60 ul from this well and mix with the 60 µl in the third well of the column, and so on until two-fold titrations are completed.  When the next-to-the-last well is mixed, take 60 ul of the 120 ul in this well and discard it. Leave the last well with 60 ul of DMSO/media diluent as a non-test compound-containing control.  Make 9 columns of titrated test compound, enough for triplicate wells each for: (1) VEGF (obtained from Pepro Tech Inc., catalogue no. 100-200, (2) endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) (also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, or aFGF) (obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica, catalogue no. 1439 600), or, (3) human PDGF B/B (1276-956, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and assay media control.  ECGF comes as a preparation with sodium heparin.<br>
2.	Transfer 50 ul/well of the test compound dilutions<br>
to the 96-well assay plates containing the 0.8-l.OxlO4<br>
cells/100 µL/well of the HUV-EC-C cells from day 0 and<br>
incubate -2 h at 37° C, 5% C02.<br>
3.	In triplicate, add 50 ul/well of 80 µg/ml VEGF, 20<br>
ng/ml ECGF, or media control to each test compound condition.<br>
As with the test compounds, the growth factor concentrations are 4X the desired final concentration.  Use the assay media from day 0 step 2 to make the concentrations of growth factors.  Incubate approximately 24 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. Each well will have 50 ul test compound dilution, 50 ul growth factor or media, and 100 ul cells, which calculates to 200 ul/well total.  Thus the 4X concentrations of test compound and growth factors become IX once everything has been added to the wells.<br>
DAY 2<br>
1.   Add 3H-thymidine (Amersham, catalogue no. TRK-686) at 1 µCi/well (10 µl/well of 100 µCi/ml solution made up in RPMI media + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) and incubate -24 h at 37°C, 5% C02.  RPMI is obtained from Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 11875-051. DAY 3<br>

IN VIVO ANIMAL MODELS<br>
XENOGRAFT ANIMAL MODELS<br>
The ability of human tumors to grow as xenografts in athymic mice (e.g., Balb/c, nu/nu) provides a useful in vivo model for studying the biological response to therapies for human tumors.  Since the first successful xenotransplantation of human tumors into athymic mice, (Rygaard and Povlsen, 1969, Acta Pathol. Microbial. Scand. 77:758-760), many different human tumor cell lines (e.g., mammary, lung, genitourinary, gastro-intestinal, -head and neck, glioblastoma, bone, and malignant melanomas) have been transplanted and successfully grown in nude mice. The following assays may be used to determine the level of activity, specificity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention.  Three general types of assays are useful for evaluating compounds: cellular/catalytic, cellular/biological and in vivo.  The object of the cellular/catalytic assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the ability of a TK to phosphorylate tyrosines on a known substrate in a cell.  The object of the cellular/biological assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the biological response stimulated by a TK in a cell.  The object of the in vivo assays is to determine the effect of a compound in an animal model of a particular disorder such as cancer.<br>
Suitable cell lines for subcutaneous xenograft experiments include C6 cells (glioma, ATCC # CCL 107), A375 cells (melanoma, ATCC # CRL 1619), A431 cells (epidermoid<br>
carcinoma, ATCC # CRL 1555), Calu 6 cells (lung, ATCC # HTB 56), PC3 cells {prostate, ATCC # CRL 1435), SKOV3TP5 cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts genetically engineered to overexpress EGFR, PDGFR, IGF-1R or any other test kinase. The following protocol can be used to perform xenograft experiments:<br>
Female athymic mice (BALB/c, nu/nu) are obtained from Simonsen Laboratories (Gilroy, CA). All animals are maintained under clean-room conditions in Micro-isolator cages with Alpha-dri bedding.  They receive sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum.<br>
Cell lines are grown in appropriate medium (for example, MEM, DMEM, Ham's F10, or Ham's F12 plus 5% - 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine (GLN)). All cell culture media, glutamine, and fetal bovine serum are purchased from Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) unless otherwise specified.  All cells are grown in a humid atmosphere of '90-95% air and 5-10% C02 at 37°C.  All cell lines are routinely subcultured twice a week and are negative for mycoplasma as determined by the Mycotect method (Gibco).<br>
Cells are harvested at or near confluency with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and pelleted at 450 x g for 10 min.  Pellets are resuspended in sterile PBS or media (without FBS) to a particular concentration and the cells are implanted into the hindflank of the mice (8 - 10 mice per group, 2 - 10 x 10s cells/animal) .  Tumor growth is measured over 3 to -6 weeks using venier calipers.  Tumor volumes are calculated as a product of length x width x height unless otherwise indicated. P values are calculated using the Students t-test.  Test compounds in 50 - 100 µL excipient (DMSO, or VPD:D5W) can be delivered by IP injection at different concentrations generally starting at day one after implantation. TUMOR INVASION MODEL<br>
The following tumor invasion model has been developed and may be used for the evaluation of therapeutic value and efficacy of the compounds identified to selectively inhibit KDR/FLK-1 receptor.<br>
Procedure<br>
8 week old nude mice (female) (Simonsen Inc.) are used as experimental animals.  Implantation of tumor cells can be performed in a laminar flow hood.  For anesthesia, Xylazine/Ketamine Cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg Xylazine) are administered intraperitoneally.  A midline incision is done to expose the abdominal cavity (approximately 1.5 cm in length) to inject 107 tumor cells in a volume of 100 µl medium.  The cells are injected either into the duodenal lobe of the pancreas or under the serosa of the colon.  The peritoneum and muscles are closed with a 6-0 silk continuous suture and the skin is closed by using wound clips.  Animals are observed daily. Analysis<br>
After 2-6 weeks, depending on gross observations of the animals, the mice are sacrificed, and the local tumor metastases to various organs (lung, liver, brain, stomach, spleen, heart, muscle) are excised and analyzed (measurement of tumor size, grade of invasion, immunochemistry, in situ hybridization determination, etc.). C-KIT ASSAY<br>
This assay .is used to detect the level of c-kit tyrosine phosphorylation.<br>
M07E (human acute myeloid leukemia) cells were serum starved overnight in 0.1% serum. Cells were pre-treated with the compound (concurrent with serum starvation), prior to ligand stimulation.  Cells were stimulated with 250 ng/ml rh-SCF for 15 minutes. Following stimulation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-c-kit antibody. Phosphotyrosine and protein levels were determined by Western blotting. MTT PROLIFERATION ASSAY<br>
M07E cells were serum starved and pre-treated with compound as described for the phosphorylation experiments. Cells were plated @ 4X105 cells/well in a 96 well dish, in 100 µL RPMI + 10% serum. rh-SCF (100 ng/mL) was added and<br>
the plate was incubated for 48 hours.  After 48 hours, 10 µL of 5 mg/ml MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was added and allowed to incubate for 4 hours.  Acid isopropanol (100 µl of 0.04N HC1 in isopropanol) was added and the optical density was measured at a wavelength of 550 nm. APOPTOSIS ASSAY<br>
M07E cells were incubated +./- SCF and +/- compound in 10% FBS with rh-GM-CSF(lOng/mL) and rh-IL-3 (lOng/mL). Samples were assayed at 24 and 48 hours. To measure activated caspase-3, samples were washed with PBS and permeabilized with ice-cold 70% ethanol. The cells were then stained with PE-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-active caspase-3 and analyzed by FACS. To measure cleaved PARP, samples were lysed and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-PARP antibody. Additional assays<br>
Additional assays which may be used to evaluate the compounds of this invention include, without limitation, a bio-flk-1 assay, an EGF receptor-HER2 chimeric receptor assay in whole cells, a bio-src assay, a bio-lck assay and an assay measuring the phosphorylation function of raf.  The protocols for each of these assays may be found in U. S. Application Ser. No. 09/099,842, which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, herein. Measurement of Cell Toxicity<br>
Therapeutic compounds should be more potent in inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinase activity than in exerting a cytotoxic effect.  A measure of the effectiveness and cell toxicity of a compound can be obtained by determining the therapeutic index, i.e., IC50/LD50. IC50, the dose required to achieve 50% inhibition, can be measured using standard techniques such as those described herein. LD50, the dosage which results in 50% toxicity, can also be measured by standard techniques as well (Mossman, 1983, J._ Immunol. Methods, 65:55-63), by measuring the amount of LDH released (Korzeniewski and Callewaert, 1983, J. Immunol. Methods,<br>
64:313, Decker and Lohmann-Matthes, 1988, J. Immunol. Methods, 115:61), or by measuring the lethal dose in animal models. Compounds with a large therapeutic index are preferred. The therapeutic index should be greater than 2, preferably at leas 10, more preferably at least 50.<br>
B.  Example of Cellular Assay Results Using 5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl) -2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl) amide.<br>
To confirm the potency of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-. dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl) -2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) detected in biochemical assays(vide infra), -the ability of said compound to inhibit ligand-dependent RTK phosphorylation was evaluated in cell-based assays using NIH-3T3 mouse cells engineered to overexpress Flk-1 or human PDGFRp.  5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited VEGF-dependent Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with an IC50 value of approximately 0..03 µM. .This value is similar to the 0.009 µM KI value determined for inhibition of Flk-1 by 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) determined in biochemical assays.  This indicates that 5- (5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) readily penetrates into cells.  Consistent with the biochemical data (vide infra) indicating that 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl) -2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) had comparable activity against Flk-1 and PDGFRP, it was also found that it inhibited PDGF-dependent. receptor phosphorylation in cells with an IC50 value of approximately 0.03 µM.  The ability of 5- (5-fluoro-2-oxo-l, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-<br>
diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) to inhibit c-Kit, a closely related RTK that binds stem cell factor (SCF), was determined using M07E cells that express this receptor.  In these cells, 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid. (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited SCF-dependent c-kit phosphorylation with an IC50 value of 0.01-0.1 µM.  This compound also inhibited SCF-stimulated c-kit phosphorylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AMD blasts isolated from the peripheral blood of patients.<br>
In addition to testing the ability of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) to inhibit ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation in cells, its effect on ligand-dependent proliferative response of cells was also examined in vitro (see Table 4).  In these studies, cells quiesced by overnight serum starvation were induced to undergo DNA synthesis upon addition of the appropriate mitogenic ligand.  As shown in Table 4, 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited the PDGF-induced proliferation of NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing PDGFRP or PDGFRcc with IC50 values 0.031 and 0.069 µM, respectively, and the SCF-induced proliferation of M07E cells with an IC50 value of 0.007 µM.<br>
TABLE 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 4, there is a general agreement between the biochemical and cellular activities of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) supporting the conclusion that this compound crosses cellular membranes.  Further, it can be concluded that the cellular responses are a result of the activity of compound 80 against the indicated target.  In contrast, when tested in the presence of complete, growth medium in vitro, substantially higher concentrations of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl) amide (Compound 80) (&gt;10 µM) were required to inhibit the growth of a variety of human tumor cells (see Table 5).  This indicates that the compound did not directly inhibit the growth of these cells at concentrations required to inhibit ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation.<br>
TABLE 5<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Briefly, the results shown in Table 5 were obtained by incubating cells for 48 hr in complete growth medium in the presence of serial dilutions 5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide.  At the end of the growth period, the relative number of cells was determined.  IC50 values were calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibited the growth of cells by 50% relative to untreated cells.  LD50 values were calculated as the concentration of compound that caused a 50% reduction in the number of cells relative to those at the start of the experiment.<br>
A more relevant cell-based assay in which to evaluate the anti-angiogenic potential of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) is the in vitro mitogenesis assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model system for the endothelial cell proliferation critical to the angiogenic process.  In this assay, a mitogenic response, measured as an increase in DNA synthesis, is induced in serum-starved HUVECs upon addition of VEGF or FGF.  In these cells, 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited the VEGF- and FGF-induced mitogenic response in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 0.004 µM and 0.7 µM, respectively, when compound was present throughout the 48-hr<br>
assay.<br>
Briefly, the aforementioned results were obtained using Serum-starved HUVECs that were incubated with mitogenic concentrations of VEGF (100 ng/ml) or FGF (30 ng/ml) in the presence of serial dilutions of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80} for 24 hrs.  The mitogenic response during the following 24 hrs. in the presence of ligand and inhibitor was quantitated by measurement of DNA synthesis based on incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into cellular DNA.<br>
In separate experiments, compound 80 inhibited the VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 (p42/44MAP kinase), an early downstream target of Flk-1/KDR, in a dose-dependent manner.  The inhibitory activity of compound 80 was also shown to be long-lasting in this system; inhibiting VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 for as long as 48 hours after removal of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) from the medium following a short (2 hr) exposure to micromolar concentrations of the compound.<br>
VEGF has been recognized to be an important survival factor for endothelial cells.  Since 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibits the VEGF-dependent mitogenic response of HUVECs, the effect of the compound on HUVEC survival was investigated.  In these experiments, cleavage of the caspase 3 substrate poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerase (PARP) was used as a readout for apoptosis.  HUVECs cultured in serum-free conditions for 24 hours exhibited substantial levels of PARP cleavage, as detected by the accumulation of the 23 kDa PARP cleavage fragment.  This was largely prevented by the addition of VEGF to the cell medium, indicating that VEGF acts as a survival factor in this assay. 5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-<br>
ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) has been shown to inhibit KDR signaling.  Accordingly, 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl) -2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited VEGF-mediated HUVEC survival in a dose-dependent manner.  Thus, these data indicate that compound 80 induced apoptosis in endothelial cells in culture in the presence of VEGF. C.  In vivo Efficacy Studies<br>
i.   Efficacy Against Established Tumor Xenografts The in vivo efficacy of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl) -2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) was studied in subcutaneous (SC) xenograft models using human tumor cells implanted into the hindflank region of athymic mice.  Following implantation, tumors were allowed to become established to a size of 100-550 mm3 prior to starting oral treatment with the compound.<br>
Daily oral administration of compound 80 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of A431 tumor growth when treatment was initiated after tumors had grown to a size of 400 mm3. Statistically significant (P 
 <br>
end of treatment.  In the two animals in which the tumors regrew to a large size (2000-3000 mm3), the tumors regressed in response to a second round of treatment with compound 80. Importantly, in all efficacy experiments, 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) at 80 mg/kg/day has been well tolerated, even when dosed continuously for more than 100 days.<br>
TABLE 6<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Briefly, the results shown in Table 6 were obtained using A431 cells (0.5 x 106 cells/mouse) which were implanted SC into the hindflank region of athymic mice.  Daily oral administration of 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) in a Cremophore-based vehicle or vehicle control began when- tumors reached the indicated average volume.  Tumors were measured using vernier calipers and tumor volume was calculated as the product of length x width x height.  P-values were calculated by comparing the size of the tumors for animals that were treated with compound 80 (n=8) to those of animals that were treated with a vehicle (n=16) on the last day of the experiment, using the two-tailed Student's t-test.<br>
The efficacy compound 80 against established human tumors of different origins was determined using Colo205 (colon carcinoma), SF763T (glioma), and NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung carcinoma) xenografts (see Table 7).  These experiments were conducted using 5-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) administered orally at 80 mg/kg/day; a dose that was effective and well tolerated.<br><br>
TABLE 7<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the abbvementioned experiments, compound 80 was administered once daily at 80 mg/kg in a Cremophor-based vehicle once tumors reached the indicated size. Percent inhibition compared to the vehicle-treated control group was calculated at termination of the experiments. P-values were calculated by comparing tumor sizes of the animals that had been treated with the compound to tumor sizes of those animals that had been treated with the vehicle, using the two-tailed Student's t-test.<br>
Although 5- (5-fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide (Compound 80) inhibited the growth of all the tumor types shown in Table 7, there was a difference1 in the response of the different xenograft models. Specifically, the growth of NCI-H460 and SF763T tumors was arrested or greatly slowed whereas the Colo205 tumors, like A431 tumors, regressed when treated with 5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-1, 2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2, 4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide.<br>
In order to determine the molecular basis for the difference in response between xenograft models, the SF763T tumors were studied.  Therefore, SF763T tumors, which were less responsive to treatment with 5-(5-Fluoro-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidenemethyl)-2,4-dimethyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-diethylamino-ethyl)amide, have been evaluated at the molecular level using immunohistological techniques to determine the effect of treatment with the<br>
compound.  These studies were initially conducted in this tumor type because SF763T tumors are highly vascularized with  microvessels that strongly express the endothelial cell marker CD31 and are hence well suited for studies of tumor microvessel density (MVD).  Immunohistological evaluation of SF763T tumors indicated that tumors from treated animals had reduced MVD relative to vehicle-treated controls, consistent with an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action for compound 80; MVD was 24.2 ± 4.1 in animals treated with compound 80, compared to 39.3 ± 5.7 for those that were treated with just the vehicle.  As anticipated from the associated tumor growth arrest, a pronounced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation was evident in tumors that were treated with compound 80. These tumors had half the mitotic index of those in vehicle-treated tumors (data not shown.  The effect compound 80 on MVD and tumor cell proliferation indicates that the compound has profound anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects, even under conditions in which tumors do not regress. .<br>
The ability of compound 80 to inhibit PDGFR phosphorylation and subsequent signaling in vivo was also evaluated in the SF763T tumors, which express high levels of PDGFRß.  Treatment of the SF763T tumors with compound 80 strongly inhibited PDGFRP tyrosine phosphorylation in established SF763T tumors.  Compound 80 also reduced the levels of phosphorylated (activated) phospholipase C gamma (PLC-y), an immediate downstream indicator of PDGFR activation. These data demonstrate that oral administration of compound 80 causes a direct effect on target (PDGFR) activity in tumors in vivo.<br>
Based on the demonstration that the ability of compound 80 to inhibit VEGF-dependent signaling in HUVECs in vitro was long-lasting (vide supra), the efficacy of the compound was evaluated when the compound was administered infrequently in the Colo205 tumor model.  As shown in Table 8, 80 mg/kg (91% inhibition) and 40 mg/kg (84% inhibition) were efficacious when administered daily, but not when administered twice<br>
weekly.  In contrast, a higher dose of compound 80 (160 mg/kg) did inhibit (52% inhibition) the growth of established Colo205 tumors when administered twice weekly, suggesting that this compound can demonstrate efficacy when administered infrequently at a higher dose.  It should be noted that dosing regimens may be determined by those with ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.<br>
TABLE 8<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Briefly, the results shown in Table 8 were obtained using Colo205 cells (0.5 x 10s cells/mouse) that had been implanted SC into the hindflank region of athymic mice. Oral administration of compound 80 according to the indicated schedule began when tumors reached 400 mm3.  Tumors were measured using vernier calipers and tumor volume was calculated as the product of length x width x height.  P-values were calculated by comparing the size of the tumors for animals that were treated with compound 80 to those of animals that were treated with a vehicle on the last day of the experiment, using the two-tailed Student's t-test.<br>
ii.  Efficacy of Compound 80 in a Model of Disseminated Disease<br>
In addition to supporting the sustained growth of solid primary tumors, angiogenesis is also an essential component supporting the development of disseminated disease due to metastasis from the primary tumor.  The effect of compound 80 on the development of disseminated disease was examined in the B16-Fl mouse melanoma lung colonization model.  In this model, B16-F1 cells inoculated intravenously via the tail vein of athymic mice<br>
Colonize the lungs and form tumors.  As shown in Table 8, oral administration of compound 80 at 80 mg/kg/day effectively reduced the burden of B16-F1 cells in the lung as evaluated by measurements of total lung weight. These data suggest that compound 80 can inhibit disseminated disease in vivo.<br>
TABLE 9<br><br>

Briefly, the results shown in Table 9 were obtained using athymic mice that had been inoculated with B16-F1 tumor cells. (5xl05 cells/mouse) via the tail vein. Mice were treated daily with orally administered compound 80 at 80 mg/kg/day (n=10) or vehicle (n=18) for 24 days after tumor cell inoculation.  At the end of the treatment period, the mice were sacrificed and their lungs removed and weighed.  Percent inhibition was calculated by comparing the lung weight of those animals that had been treated with compound 80, with the lung weight of the animals that had only been treated with vehicle.  P-values were determined using the two-tailed Student's t-test. D.   Examples of Biological Activity.<br>
Examples of the in vitro potency of compounds of this invention are shown in Table 2.<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
In studies to investigate the pharmacpkinetic characteristics of the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention it has been demonstrated that oral administration of a single dose of said compounds resulted in high oral bioavailability in mice.  The good-oral bioavailability and linear pharmacokinetics indicate that the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present have favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the split-kinase domain RTKs FLK-1/KDR and PDGFR, which are involved in angiogenesis, and the RTK c-kit, a receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), that is involved in certain hematologic cancers. At higher concentrations, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention also inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR-1, a third RTK involved in angiogenesis.  Consistent with their biochemical activity, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention inhibit the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of target RTKs and the in vitro mitogenic response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with VEGF or FGF, of PDGFR-expressing NIH-3T3 cells stimulated with PDGF, and of MOVE acute myeloid leukemia cells stimulated with SCF .  In contrast, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention do not directly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in complete growth medium except at concentrations 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than those required to inhibit the ligand-dependent mitogenic responses.  In mouse xenograft studies, the compounds of the prefered embodiments of the present invention inhibited the growth of established human tumors of various origins in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations that were well tolerated even upon extended (&gt;100 days) dosing.  At 80 mg/kg/day, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention induced regression of large established A431 and Colo205 tumors, and caused substantial growth inhibition or stasis of SF763T and NCI-H460 tumors.  In mice bearing SF763T tumors, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention caused reductions in microvessel density, phosphorylation of PDGFR in the tumors, and mitotic index in the tumor cells.  At this dose, the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention also inhibited lung colonization by B16-F1 tumor cells in a model of tumor metastasis.  Regimen studies<br>
demonstrated that the compounds of the preferred embodiments   of the present invention are most efficacious when<br>
administered daily.  Direct evidence of the anti-angiogenic activity of the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention was detected in SF763T tumors in which microvessel density was reduced.  Direct evidence that the compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention inhibit PDGFR phosphorylation and signaling in vivo was also obtained in SF763T tumors.<br>
Taken together, these data support the notion that orally administered compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are anti-angiogenic agents for the treatment of cancers, including solid tumors and hematological malignancies in which angiogenesis and/or signaling through c-kit are important in the disease pathology.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds, methods and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are effective in modulating PK activity and therefore are expected to be effective as therapeutic agents against RTK, CTK-, and STK-related disorders.<br>
