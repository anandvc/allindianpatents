				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A method and apparatus for controlling various functional elements in a digital telephone system using state determination from an echo canceller. An echo canceller is used to evaluate which one of five talk states two speakers are engaged in during a telephone conversation. This state determination information is used to control a tone detector function, a noise suppressor function, an adaptive equalizer function, a transmission mute function, and a vocoder encoder function within a vocoder. During the talk state where the far-end speaker is active and the near-end speaker is inactive, the echo canceller provides a signal which disables background noise estimates from being performed in the noise suppressor and the vocoder encoder. The same signal is used to disable the tone detector and to enable the transmission mute function during this talk state.</td>

The present invention relates to a clamping jaw and, more particularly, to a clamping jaw of the kind comprising two separate jaw members and a common elongate support member for said jaw members, located behind them, the jaw members and the support member being provided with co-operating engagement means, permitting the jaw members to be placed at a selectable stepwise variable distance from each other in the longitudinal direction of the support member and with selectable ends thereof facing each other, each jaw member being provided with two resilient holding means which project in mutually opposite lateral directions from the jaw member and which are arranged to be received each in one of two opposite longitudinal grooves, formed each in one of two parallel longitudinal flanges of the support member, in order hereby to hold the jaw member releasably connected to the support member in a selected position in which the engagement means of the jaw member are in engagement with the engagement means of the support member.<br>
A clamping jaw of said kind is previously known through WO 93/25821. This known clamping jaw is intended to be used in a device which is adapted to be mounted on a profile member or to serve as a mounting for such a member and wherein the clamping jaw may be brought into contact under pressure against the profile member by means of two transversally extending clamping bolts, placed each on one side of said member. As a consequence of the fact that the jaw members may be placed at a selectable distance from each other and with selectable ends thereof facing each other, the clamping jaw may easily be adjusted to fit different profile members of considerably varying shape and size.<br>
However, a distadvantage of the above-mentioned known clamping jaw is that the type of resilient holding<br><br>
means utilized in said jaw is comparatively expensive due to the fact that it is made as a prefabricated unit, comprising a cylindrical casing which contains a steel ball and a helical spring, located behind said bal1, and which, at its outer end, is provided with special inwardly bent edge flanges, preventing the ball from projecting more than a short limited distance from the casing at said end thereof. For the above reasons, the manufacturing costs for the resilient holding means constitute an unacceptably large portion of the total manufacturing costs for the known clamping jaw.<br>
The present invention has for its purpose to provide an improved clamping jaw of the kind initially specified, where the costs for the resilient holding means are substantially lower than in the case of the above-mentioned known device.<br>
The clamping jaw, according to the invention proposed for said purpose, is primarily characterized in that said holding means are formed by portions of resilient metal wire elements, fitted on to the jaw members, which portions are insertable into said grooves in the flanges of the support member.<br>
By utilizing portions of resilient metal wire elements, fitted on to the jaw members, as the required holding means for the jaw members, it is possible to reduce the costs for said means to an amount which is neglectable in comparison to the manufacturing costs for the other portions of the clamping jaw.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the two holding means of each jaw member may be formed by a single resilient metal wire element fitted on   to the jaw member. This metal wire element may preferably have a generally yoke-like shape and comprise an approximately straight web portion which extends<br><br>
in the transversal direction of the jaw member and rests in a groove in the jaw member, extending in said direction, and two legs which extend in mutually slightly diverging directions from the web portion at opposite sides of the jaw member and which include generally arcuately bent laterally projecting portions, located near the free ends of said legs and forming said holding means, and inwardly bent end portions which extend into recesses in the jaw member, serving to receive said end portions therein.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above-mentioned known clamping jaw is that it is not possible effectively to prevent an unintenitonal release of the jaw members from the support member. However, in the clamping jaw according to the invention, such an unintentional separation of the jaw members from the support member may easily be prevented. To this end, the clamping jaw according to the invention may also comprise blocking means which are insertable between the portions of the resilient metal wire elements, insertable into said grooves in the support member, and portions of the lateral surfaces of the jaw members, located behind said portions and by means of which, upon an insertion of said portions of the resilient metal wire elements into said grooves in the support member, said portions may be releasably locked in positions in which they extend into said grooves. The two blocking means of each jaw member may then preferably be formed by two approximately parallei legs of a further metal wire element having a generally yoke-like shape.<br>
Below the invention is further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure 1 shows an exploded perspective view of a clamping jaw according to an embodiment of the invention, selected by way of example,<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a portion of the clamping jaw according to Figure 1, showing one of two jaw members of the clamping jaw mounted at a support member common to both jaw members,<br>
Figure 3 shows an end view of said clamping jaw in section taken along line III-III in Figure 4, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a side elevation, partly in section, of said clamping jaw.<br>
The clamping jaw shown in the drawings comprises two jaw members 11 and a common elongate support member 12 for said jaw members. As indicated in dash-dotted lines in Figure 4, jaw members 11 may be brought into contact under pressure against a profile member 13 by means of supporting member 12 and two transversally extending clamping bolts 14 located each on one side of said profile member. At its side opposite to the illustrated clamping jaw, profile member 13 may rest against a further clamping jaw or another counter support to which the two clamping bolts 14 are anchored at the ends thereof not shown in the drawings.<br>
At their rear sides 11A, by means of which they are intended to rest against support member 12, jaw members 11 are provided with transversally extending teeth 15 and intermediate tooth gaps 16, while, at its front side 12A, support member 12 is provided with two rows of transversally extending teeth 17 and intermediate tooth gaps 18. Teeth 15 and 17 form co-operating engagement means of jaw members 11 and support member 12 which may be brought into engagement with each other in order to make it possible to place jaw members 11 at a selectable stepwise variable distance from each other in the longitudinal direction of the support member and with selectable ends 19 and 20 thereof facing each other. Support member 12 has two longitudinally extending flanges 21 which are located at opposite sides of its<br><br>
supporting surface for jaw members 11, where teeth 17 are provided, and which project in a forward direction from said surface. At the sides thereof facing each other, said flanges are provided each with one longitudinally extending groove 22. These grooves 22 serve to receive resilient holding means fitted on to jaw members 11 and adapted to be inserted into said grooves. By means of said holding means, the jaw members may be held releasably connected to support member 12 in selected positions in which teeth 15 of jaw members 11 are in engagement with teeth 17 of supporting member 12.<br>
In order to produce said holding means, each jaw member 11 is provided with a resilient metal wire element 23 having a generally yoke-like shape and comprising an approximately straight web portion 24, which rests in a transversally extending groove 25 in the jaw member, and two legs 26, which extend in mutually slightly diverging directions from web portion 24 at opposite sides of the jaw member and which include generally arcuately bent laterally projecting portions 27, located near the free ends of said legs and adapted to form resilient holding means which may be inserted each into one of the two grooves 22. Moreover, legs 26 also include inwardly bent end portions 28 which extend into a transversally extending groove 29 in jaw member 11, provided at the rear side of said member, and which serve to keep metal wire element 23 fitted on to the jaw member.<br>
When mounting a jaw member 11 to the support member 12, portions 27 of element 2 3 are brought into resilient contact with the walls of grooves 22. In order then to prevent an unintentional separation of jaw member 11 from support member 12 as a consequence of any ruff handling of the clamping jaw, separate blocking means are provided which can be inserted between<br><br>
portions 27 of element 23 and the adjacent lateral surfaces of the jaw member in order to lock said portions in positions in which they extend into grooves 22. In the illustrated embodiment, the two blocking means of each jaw member are formed by two approximately parallel legs 30 of a further metal wire element 31 having a generally yoke-like shape.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the embodiment above described and shown in the drawings. Instead, many other embodiments are feasible within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. For instance , it could be mentioned that the two resilient holding means of each jaw member may be formed by two separate resilient metal wire elements instead of a single such element.<br><br><br><br>
