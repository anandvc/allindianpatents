Technical Field<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a saddle-riding type vehicle<br>

[0004] Patent Document 1.	JP-A-08-067285<br>
Patent Document 2:	JP~A-05-330474<br>
Patent Document 3:	JP-A-03-330475<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention 15 to solve<br>
[0005] Incidentally, in such a saddle-riding type vehicle, it<br>
is desired to reduce weight of a body frame or reduce width<br>
of the vehicle while maintaining strength of the body frame.<br>
For improvement of convenience in getting on and off the vehicle,<br>
it is also desired to keep a portion ahead of a seat low.<br>
[0006] However, in the conventional saddle-riding type vehicle,<br>
the engine is supported by the pair of left and right main frames<br>
and brackets in an upper part and a rear part of a crankcase<br>
of the engine. Consequently, the main frames and the brackets<br>
are required to have rigidity that is large to some extent.<br>
Therefore, in order to secure rigidity of the main frames and<br>
the brackets, it is necessary to increase thickness of the main<br>
frames and the brackets. However, when thickness of the main<br>
frames and the like is increased, it is difficult to reduce<br>
weight of the body frame<br>
[0007] In the conventional saddle-ridinq type vehicle, both.<br>
the engine and the rear swing arms ate held between the pair<br>
of left and right brackets. Consequently, an interval between<br>
2<br><br>
the left and the right brackets is increased and the main frame<br>
sticks out in the Left to right direction. Therefore, it is<br>
difficult to reduce width of the vehicle (a reduction in width<br>
in a vehicle Width direction).<br>
[0008] Thus, it is an object of the invention to realize a<br>
reduction in weight of a body frame while maintaining strength<br>
of the body frame in a saddle-riding type vehicle. It is<br>
another object of the invention to realize a reduction in width<br>
of the vehicle while maintaining strength of the body frame.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to keep a portion<br>
ahead of a seat of the vehicle low.<br>
Means for salving the Problems<br>
[0009] A saddle-riding type vehicle according to the invention<br>
includes: a head pipe that supports a steering shaft to<br>
rotationally move freely: a body frame including a main frame<br>
that is connected to the bead pipe and extends obliquely-<br>
downward to the rear and a pair of left and right sub-frames<br>
that are connected to the main frame and extend obliquely<br>
downward to the rear; and a motor supported by the main frame<br>
and the respective sub-frames in a suspended state.<br>
[0010] According to the saddle-riding type vehicle, the motor<br>
is supported by the main frame and both the sub-frames, whereby<br>
the motor is arranged to be laid over the main frame and both<br>
the left and the right sub-frames- As a result, since the main<br>
frame and the sub-frames are reinforced by the motor, it is<br>
3<br><br>
possible to keep strength of the main frame itself or the<br>
sub-frames themselves low because of reinforcement by the motor.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to resalize a seduction in a size or<br>
a reduction in weight of the body frame while maintaining<br>
strength of the body frame.<br>
[0011] It is preferable that a connecting portion of the main<br>
frame ancl the sub-frames is located ahead of a portion<br>
supporting the motor in the main frame.<br>
[0012] Consequently, a portion between a front end portion of<br>
the main frame and a portion supporting the motor 15 reinforced<br>
by the sub-frames. Thus, strength of the main frame is improved.<br>
Note that a necessary strength distribution of the main frame<br>
differs for each vehicle. However, it is possible to make a<br>
strength distribution of the main frame suitable or optimum<br>
by adjusting a connecting position of the sub-frames to the<br>
main frame appropriately.<br>
[0013] It is preferable that the head pipe is connected to a<br>
front end side of the main frame and a cross sectional area<br>
of the main frame changes along a longitudinal direction of<br>
the main frame such that the front end side is larger than a<br>
rear end side.<br>
[0014] Note that the change in the cross sectional area of the<br>
main frame may be continuous or stepwise along the longitudinal<br>
direction of the main frame. A form of the change in the cross<br>
sectional area is not specifically lumited.<br>
4<br><br>
[0015] Consequently, the main frame is formed relatively thick<br>
on the front end side connected to the head pipe. Thus, it<br>
is possible to secure larger strength of the main frame against<br>
bending moment. On the other hand, since the rear end of the<br>
main frame is formed relatively thin, when a body cover on a<br>
front side of the seat is arranged above the rear end of the<br>
main frame, it is possible to keep the body cover low.<br>
[0016] It is preferable that the main frame supports the motor<br>
at the rear end of the main frame.<br>
[0017] Consequently, it is possible to reduce length of the<br>
main frame.<br>
[0018] It is possible that the sub-frames are bent convexly<br>
downward and support the motor at least in one place near bent<br>
portions.<br>
[0019] Consequently, the motor functions as a reinforcing<br>
member to increase strength of the bent portions of the<br>
sub-frames. Since the strength of the sub-frames increases.<br>
it is possible to realize a reduction in a size or a reduction<br>
in weight of the sub-frames. Since it is possible to reduce<br>
a size of the sub-frames, it is possible to keep the body cover<br>
on the front side of the seat low.<br>
[0020] It is preferable that the sub-frames are bent convexly<br>
downward and support the motor at least in one place further<br>
on a rear side than the bent portions.<br>
[0021] Consequently, the motor functions as a reinforcing<br>
5<br><br>
member and strength in portions further on the rear side of<br>
the bent portions in the sub-frames increases. Since the<br>
strength of the sub-frames increases, it is possible to realise<br>
a reduction in size and a reduction in weight of the sub-frames .<br>
Since it is possible to reduce a size of the sub-frames, it<br>
is possible to keep the body covet on the front side of the<br>
seat low.<br>
[0022] It is preferable that the saddle-riding type vehicle<br>
includes: a rear wheel; and rear arms that support the rear<br>
wheel and extend substantially in a front to rear direction,<br>
the sub-crams iS beat convexly downward, and both a part of<br>
the motor and the rear arms are supported at the rear ends of<br>
the sub-frames.<br>
[0023] Consequently, since a part of the motor 15 supported<br>
together with the rear arms, it is possible to simplify a<br>
supporting structure for the motor and the rear arms. Since<br>
the motor and the rear anus are supported together, in using<br>
brackets for support, it is possible to reduce a size of the<br>
brackets compared with a case in which the motor and the rear<br>
arms are supported separately. Since it is possible to reduce<br>
a size of the brackets in this way, it is possible to increase<br>
strength of the entire body frame.<br>
[0024] It is preferable that the sub-frames are bent convexly<br>
downward and the saddle-riding type vehicle further includes<br>
rear side frames that are connected to a portion further on<br>
6<br><br>
the rear side than the bent portions of the sub-frames and<br>
extand obliquely upward to the rear.<br>
[0025] Consequently, the rear side portions of the sub-frames<br>
are reinforced by the reer side frames, it is possible to<br>
reduce a size of the sub-frames because the sub-frames are<br>
rein forced. Thus, it is possible to keep the body cover on<br>
the front side of the seat low.<br>
[0026] The. saddle-riding type vehicle may include plural rear<br>
side frames that are connected to the rear ends of the<br>
sub-frames, respectively, to extend obliquely upward to the<br>
rear and are connected to one another.<br>
[0027] Consequently, the rear side portions of the sub-frames<br>
are reinforced by the plural rear side frames connected to one<br>
another. Thus, strength of the sub-frames increases.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to realise a reduction in a size or<br>
a, reduction in weight of the sub--frames. It is possible to<br>
keep the body cover on the front side of the seat low through<br>
the reduction in a size of the sub-frames.<br>
[0028] It is preferable that the sub-frames support the motor<br>
at least in one place tvear connecting portions to which the<br>
rear side frames are connected.<br>
[0025] Consequently, a part of the motor is supported by<br>
portions reinforced by the rear side frames in the sub-frames.<br>
Thus, it is possible to realize a reduction in a size or a<br>
reduction in weight of the sub-frames themselvee. Since it<br>
7<br><br>
is possible to reduce a size of the sub-frames, it is possible<br>
to keep the body cover on the front side of the seat low.<br>
[0030] it is preferable that the motor consists of an internal<br>
combustion engine having a crankcase and a cylinder that<br>
extends forward or obliquely upward to the front from the<br>
crankfcase, the cylinder is supported by the main frame, and<br>
the crankcase is supported by the sub-frames.<br>
[0031] Consequently, since the cylinder located on the front<br>
side of the motor is supported by the main frame and the<br>
crankcase located on the rear side of the motor is supported<br>
by the sub-frames, the motor is supported by the main frame<br>
and the sub-frames in a well-balanced state. Thus, it is<br>
possible to form the main frame and the sub-frames in<br>
appropriate lengths and form the main frame relatively short.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to realize a reduction in a size and<br>
a reduction in weight of the body frame while securing strength<br>
of the body frame.<br>
[0032] It is preferable that the cylinder extends obliquely<br>
upward to the front from the crankcase such that an axis of<br>
the cylinder extends obliquely in an upward direction, the<br>
sub-frames are bent convexly downward, and front side portions<br>
further on the front side than the bent portions in the<br>
sub-frames extend substantially parallel to the axis of the<br>
cylinder,<br>
[0033] Consequently, since the front side portions of the<br><br>
sub-frames extend along the cylinder of the internal combustion<br>
engine, it is possible to arrange the front side portions of<br>
the sub-frames in positions near the cylinder Thus, it is<br>
possible to reduce height of the sub-frames and keep the body<br>
cover covering the sub-frames low.<br>
[0034] It is preferable that the cylinder extends obliquely<br>
upward to the front from the crankcase such that the axis of<br>
the cylinder extends obliquely in the upward direction, the<br>
sub-frames are bent convexly downward, and the bent portions<br>
of the sub-frames are located above a boundary portion of the<br>
cylinder and the crankcase in the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0035] Consequently, since the sub-frames are arranged along<br>
the cylinder and the crankcase of the internal combustion<br>
engine, in setting the sub-frames and the internal combustion<br>
engine, efficient use of a space as realized. Since it is<br>
possible to arrange the sub-frames in positions near the<br>
combustion engine, it is possible to keep the body cover<br>
covering the sub-frames low,<br>
[0036] Another saddle-riding type vehicle according to the<br>
invention includes: a head pipe that supports a steering shaft<br>
to rotationally move freely; a body frame including a main frame<br>
that is connected to the head pipe and extends obliquely<br>
downward to the rear and a pair of left and right sub-frames<br>
that are connected to the main frame and extend obliquely<br>
downward to the rear; and a motor supported in positions of<br>
9<br><br>
[0040] still another saddle-riding type vehicle according to<br>
the invention is a saddle-riding type vehicle including; a head<br>
pipe that supports a steering shaft to rotationally move<br>
freely; a body frame that extends obliquely downward to the<br>
rear from the head pipe; and a motor sup-ported by the body frame<br>
in a suspended state. The body frame includes at least a pair<br>
of left and right side frames and the paddle-riding type vehicle<br>
includes' a real wheel; rear arms that support the rear wheel<br>
and extend substantially in a front to rear direction; left<br>
and right brackets fixed to the left and the right side frames,<br>
respectively; and a pivot shaft that pierces through both the<br>
brackets, both the rear arms, and the motor and attaches both<br>
the rear arms and the Motor to both the brackets in a state<br>
in which the left and the right brackets are interposed between<br>
the Left and the right rear arms and the motor, respectively.<br>
[0041] According to the saddle-riding type vehicle, the<br>
buckets fixed to the left and the right frames are interposed<br>
between the motor and the left and the right rear arms,<br>
respectively. Thus, it is possible to reduce an interval<br>
between the left and the right brackets compared with a case<br>
in which the brackets are provided on an outer side of the motor<br>
and the rear arms. Therefore, it is possible to reduce<br>
intervals on the left and the right of the side frames and<br>
realise a reduction in width of the vehicle.<br>
[0042] The body frame may include a main frame that is connected<br>
11<br><br>
to the head pipe and extends obliquely downward to the rear<br>
and a pair of left and right sub-frames that are connected to<br>
the main frame and extend obliquely downward to the rear. The<br>
side frames may consist of the sub-frames.<br>
[0043] Consequently, the motor functions as a reinforcing<br>
member to increase strength of the sub-frames. Thus, it as<br>
possible to realize a reduction in a size or a reduction in<br>
weight of the frames.<br>
[0044] It is preferable that a part of the motor is supported<br>
by the main frame.<br>
[0045] Consequently, since the motor functions as the<br>
reinforcing member, strength of the main frame is increased.<br>
Thus, it is possible to realise, a further reduction in a size<br>
or reduction in weight of the body frame.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0046] As described above, according to the invention, since<br>
the motor is supported by the main frame and the left and the<br>
right sub-frames, it is possible to use the motor as the<br>
reinforcing member. Thus, it is possible to realize a<br>
reduction in a size and a reduction in weight of the body frame<br>
while maintaining strength of the body frame.<br>
[0047] If the motor is supported in positions of two places<br>
in the front and the rear of the left and the right sub-fraines,<br>
it is possible to reinforce the the places in the front and<br>
the rear of the sub-frames with the motor and realize a<br>
12<br><br>
reduction in a size and a reduction in weight while maintaining<br>
strength of the body frame<br>
[0048] If left and the right brackets fixed to a pair of left<br>
and right side frames, respectively, are interposed between<br>
the motor and the left and the right rear arms, respectively,<br>
and then the motor and the left and the right rear arms are-<br>
attached to the brackets together, it is possible to reduce<br>
an interval between the left and the right side frames and<br>
realize a reduction in width of the vehicle.<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
[0051] An embodiment of the invention will be hereinafter<br>
explained on the basis of the drawings<br>
[0052] As shown in Fig. 1, a saddle-riding type vehicle<br>
according to the embodiment 15 a motorcycle 10 of a so-called<br>
Underbone type. The motorcycle 10 includes a body frame 11<br>
forming a skeleton and an engine 12 supported by the body frame<br>
11 in a suspended state.<br>
[0053] A head pipe 15 is provided at a front end of the body<br>
frame 11. A not-shown steering shaft is inserted into the head<br>
pipe is to rotate freely. A not-shown front fork is provided<br>
on a lower side of the steering shaft. A front wheel 18 is<br>
supported by the body frame 11 to be capable of moving<br>
rotationally via the front fork and the like.<br>
[0054} One main frame 19 is fixed to the head pipe 15. The<br>
main frame 19 extends obliquely downward to the rear from the<br>
head pipe 15. In order to secure sufficient strength, the main<br>
frame 19 is formed relatively thick and a section of the main<br>
frame 19 is formed in a hollow rectangular shape. In this<br>
embodiment, the main, frame 19 is constituted by assembling a<br>
14<br><br>
pair of left and right beam-shaped members . Specifically, the<br>
main frame 13 includes a pair of left and right beam-shaped<br>
members that extend obliquely downward to the rear and are bent<br>
90 degrees at both top and bottom ends. The main frame 15 is<br>
constituted by joining bent portions of the left and the right<br>
beam-shaped members in a left to right direction. However,<br>
it goes without spying that a method of forming the hollow main<br>
frame 19 is not limited at all and other forming methods may<br>
be used.<br>
[0055] A cross-sectional area of the main frame 19 is different<br>
at a front end 19c and at a rear end 13b connected to the head<br>
pipe 15. The cross-sectional area of the main frame 19 is<br>
larger at the front end 19c than the rear end 19b and changes<br>
along a longitudinal direction of the main frame 19. Note that<br>
the cross-sectional area of the main frame 19 may chahge<br>
continuously along the longitudinal direction of the main frame<br>
19 or may change stepwise.<br>
[0056] A gusset 27 is fixed to a lower side of a front half<br>
portion of the main frame 19. The gusset 27 is arranged to<br>
be laid over between the main frame 19 and the head pipe 15.<br>
[0057] A bracket 22 is fixed to a lower side of the rear end<br>
19b of the main frame 19 A cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is<br>
attached to the bracket 22 via a bolt and a nut. In other words,<br>
the cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is supported by the main frame<br>
19 via the bracket 22.<br>
15<br><br>
[0058] The engine 12 is a water-cooled engine. The engine 12<br>
includes the cylinder 12a and a crankcase 12b. The cylinder<br>
12a extends obliquely upward to the front from the crankcase<br>
12b. The cylinder 12a includes a cylinder block, and a cylinder<br>
head attached to an upper side of the cylinder bloc}:. The<br>
cylinder 12a is supported in a posture with an axial direction<br>
of the cylinder l2a and a longitudinal direction of the main<br>
frame 19 substantially parallel to each other.<br>
[0059] A carburetor 13 is disposed behind the cylinder 12a.<br>
The carburetor 13 is arranged near a lower side of the rear<br>
end 19b of the main frame 19, that is, on an extension line<br>
to the rear of the main frame 19. An air cleaner 21 that<br>
purifies the outside air and supplies the outside air to the<br>
carnuretor 13 is disposed on a rear side of the carburetor 13.<br>
The air cleaner 21 is arranged in a position near the carburetor<br>
13, that is, a position adjacent to the carburetor 13. The<br>
air cleaner 21 assumes substantially a rectangular<br>
parallelepiped shape. As shown in Fig. l, the air cleaner 21<br>
is arranged obliquely such that an upper end side thereof is<br>
positioned further in the front of the vehicle than a lower<br>
end side thereof.<br>
[0060] A battery 34 is arranged behind and above the air cleaner<br>
21. The battery 34 is located on a lower side of a seat 36<br>
to be maintained by opening the seat 36.<br>
[0061] In this way, since the air cleaner 21 is arranged near<br>
16<br><br>
the rear of the carburetor 13, an air intake passage is made<br>
linear and simplified. Thus, it is possible to improve<br>
performance of the engine 12, The air cleaner 21 and the<br>
battery 34 are relatively large components. When the air<br>
cleaner 21 and the battery 34 are arranged in a vehicle width<br>
direction, a vehicle width tends to be large. However, in the<br>
motorcycle 10, since the air cleaner 21 and the battery 34 are<br>
arranged in a front to rear direction of the vehicle, it is<br>
possible to control the vehicle width and reduce width of the<br>
vehicle. Moreover, since the air cleaner 21 is arranged in<br>
a tilted posture, it is possible to effectively use a space<br>
on a lower side of the battery 34 as a part of a space for setting<br>
the air cleaner 21. Therefore, it is possible to control length<br>
in the front to rear direction of the vehicle and height of<br>
the vehicle while securing a capacity of the air cleaner 21.<br>
[0062] A fuel tank 35 13 disposed behind the battery 34 and<br>
below the seat 36.<br>
[0063] A radiator 24 that cools cooling water supplied to the<br>
engine 12 is arranged above the cylinder 12a of the engine 12<br>
and below the main frame 19. A not-shown bracket 13 provided<br>
in the gusset 27. The radiator 24 is supported by the body<br>
frame 11 via the bracket.<br>
[0064] Incidentally, in the vehicle of the underbone type, that<br>
is, a vehicle in which the main frame 19 inclines obliquely<br>
downward at a relatively steep angle, there 15 a problem<br>
17<br><br>
described below concerning a space for setting the radiator<br>
24. In the vehicle of the underbone type, when it is attempted<br>
to arrange the radiator 24 below the main frame 13 and above<br>
the cylinder head, a space for setting the radiator 24 is<br>
relatively limited. Thus, in the motorcycle 10, a lower edge<br>
27a of the gusset 27 is bent to be recessed upward. In other<br>
words, the lower edge 27a of the gusset 27 is bent to escape<br>
upward. Consequently, the space for setting the radiator 24<br>
increases to prevent contact of the gusset 27 and the radiator<br>
24. In other words, since the lower edge 27a of the gusset<br>
27 is bent upward, the gusset 27 and the radiator 24 are less<br>
likely to interfere with each other. It is possible to<br>
efficiently arrange the gusset 27 in a limited space. Since<br>
this makes it possible to arrange the gusset 27 with a suitable<br>
size in a suitable position., it is possible to improve strength<br>
of the main frame 19.<br>
[0065] As shown in Fig- 2, sub-frames 20 are fixed to both side<br>
portions 19a on the left and the right of the main frame 19.<br>
Specifically, a pair of sub-frames 20 are provided on the left<br>
and the right and front ends 20a of the respective sub-frames<br>
20 are fixed near the center in the Longitudinal direction of<br>
the main frame 19. Most parts of the sub-frames 20 assume a<br>
round pape shape. A section of the sub-frames 20 is formed<br>
smaller than a section of the main frame 19, A shape of the<br>
front ends 20a of the sub-frames 20 is changed from the pipe<br><br>
shape to the planar shape toward a front side thereof Portions<br>
of the planar shape are joined to the side portion 19a of the<br>
main frame 19 by welding or the like in. a, state in which the<br>
portions are in surface contact with the side portion 19a.<br>
[0066] The sub-frames 20 have a bent structure. Specifically,<br>
as shown in Fig. 1, substantially the center in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the sub-frames 20 is bent to be projected downward.<br>
Bent portions 20b are located above a boundary portion of the<br>
crankcase 12b and the cylinder 12a of the engine 12. Front<br>
side portions 20c further on the front side than the bent<br>
portions 20b extend substantially parallel to an axial<br>
direction of the cylinder 12a of the engine 12 Rear side<br>
portions 20d farther on a real side than the bent portions 20b<br>
are inclined more gently than the front side portions 20c.<br>
[0067] Brackets 23 are fixed to rear side portions 20d (portions<br>
near the rear of the bent portions 20b) of the sub-frames 20.<br>
The crankcase 12b of the engine 12 is attached to the brackets<br>
23 via a bolt and a nut.<br>
[0068] The rear side portions 20d of the sub-frames 20 extend<br>
to the rear of the engine 12. Brackets 28 are fixed to rear<br>
ends 20e of the rear side portions 20d of the sub-frames 20.<br>
Both the crankcase 12b of the engine 12 and rear arms 26 are<br>
supported by the brackets 28.<br>
[0069] Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, the brackets 28 made<br>
of metal extending downward, respectively, are fixed to the<br>
19<br><br>
rear ends 20e of the pair of left and right sub-frames 20. A<br>
pivot shaft 25 is suspended between the brackets 28. As shown<br>
in Fig 3, a bolt head 29a is provided at one end of the pivot<br>
shaft 29 and a male thread portion 29b is formed at the other<br>
end. The male thread portion 29b is screwed in a nut 30. The<br>
crankcase 12b of the engine 12 and front end cylindrical<br>
portions 26a of the rear arms 2 6 are supportea by the pivot<br>
shaft 29 supported by the brackets 28.<br>
[0070] Specifically, as showm in Fig. 3, on the left side of<br>
the engine 12, the front end cylindrical portion 26a of the<br>
rear arm 2 6 on the left side is arranged between the bolt head<br>
29a of the pivot shaft 29 and the bracket 28, The front end<br>
cylindrical portion 26a is supported by the pivot shaft 29 via<br>
a bush 38 with internal and external cylinders and is capable<br>
of rotationally moving around the pivot shaft 29 within a<br>
predetermined angle range. The bush 38 with internal and<br>
external cylinders includes an inner cylinder 38a and an outer<br>
cylinder 38c made of iron and an intermediate cylinder 38b made<br>
of rubber interposed between the inner cylinder 3Ba and the<br>
outer cylinder 38c. The pivot shaft 29 is inserted into the<br>
inner cylinder 38a and the outer cylinder 38c is pressed into<br>
the front end cylindrical portion 26a of the rear arm 26.<br>
Consequently, when the front end cylindrical portion 26a of<br>
the rear arm. 26 rotationally moves around the pivot shaft 29,<br>
the intermediate cylinder 38b made of rubber of the bush 38<br>
20<br><br>
with internal and external cylinders is elastic ally deformed<br>
to allow rotational movement of the rear arm 26 and regulate<br>
rotational movement of the rear arm 26 exceeding a<br>
predetermined range.<br>
[0071] The front end cylindrical portion 26a is also provided<br>
in the rear arm 26 on the right side of the engine 12. The<br>
front end cylindrical portion 2 6a is arranged between the<br>
bracket 28 on the right side and a washer 33 on the nut 30 side.<br>
The front end cylindrical portion 26a of the rear arm 26 on<br>
the right side is also supported to rotationally move freely<br>
by the pivot shaft 29 via the bush 38 with internal and external<br>
cylinders and rotationally moves in the predetermined angle<br>
range.<br>
[0072] Moreover, the crankcase 12b of the engine 12 is held<br>
between the pair of left and right brackets 28, 23. A<br>
through-hole 12c extending to the left and the right is formed<br>
in the crankcase 12b and the pivot shaft 29 is inserted through<br>
the through-hole 12c. With such a constitution, the crankcase<br>
12b is supported by the pivot shaft 29.<br>
[0073] The crankcase 12b of the engine 12, the left and the<br>
right brackets 28, and the left and the right inner cylinders<br>
38a are integrally combined by screwing the male thread portion<br>
29b of the pivot shaft 29 in the nut 30. The inner cylinder<br>
38a on. the right side is held between the bracket 28 on the<br>
right side and the mit 30 portion (accurately, the washer 33).<br>
21<br><br>
[0060] In this way, in the motorcycle 10, the engine 12 is fixed<br>
to be laid over between the main frame 19 and the sub-fraides<br>
20. Thus, the engine 12 also functions as a reinforcing member<br>
for the body frame 11. Therefore, it is possible to realize<br>
a redaction in a size and a reduction rn weight of the body<br>
frame 11 while maintaining strength of the vehicle.<br>
[0081] As shown in Fig, 4, according to the motorcycle 10, it<br>
is possible to form the sub-frames 20 in a thin round pipe shape.<br>
Thus, it is possible to keep a center tunnel portion 37a of<br>
the leg shield 31 in front of the seat 36 low. In other wortis,<br>
as indicated by an alternate long and two short dashes line<br>
In Fig 4, when the sub-frames 20 ate formed of relatively thick<br>
square pipes in order to increase strength, since positions<br>
of upper surfaces of the square pipes are elevated, a position<br>
of the leg shield 37 is also elevated as indicated by an<br>
alternate long and two short dashes line in the figure, on<br>
the other hand, in. the motorcycle 10, since the sub-frames 20<br>
are formed of a round pipe and thickness of the sub-frames 20<br>
is reduced, it is possible to reduce height of the leg shield<br>
37.<br>
[0082] According to the motorcycle 10, connhecting positions<br>
of the sub-frames 20 and the main frame 19, that is, positions<br>
of the front ends 20a of the sub-frames 20 are ahead of a<br>
supporting portion of the engine 12 in the main frame 19, that<br>
is, a position of the bracket 22. in this way, since the front<br>
24<br><br>
ends 20a of the sub-frames 20 are connected ahead of the<br>
supporting portion of the engine. 12 (aportion where the bucket<br>
22 is disposed) in the main frame 19, a portion between the<br>
front end 19c of the main frame 19 and the supporting portion<br>
is reinforced by the sub-frames 20. Thus, it is possible to<br>
increase strength of the main frame 19, It is possible to<br>
effectively increase strength of the main frame 19 by<br>
contriving a connecting position of the sub-frames 20 according<br>
to a necessary strength distribution of the main frame 19.<br>
[0083] The main frame 19 is formed thicker at the front end<br>
19c than the rear end 19b. Thus, on the front end. 19c side<br>
connected to the head pipe 15, it is possible to secure strength<br>
against bending moment sufficiently. On the other hand, it<br>
is possible to form the rear end 19b side thin. Since it is<br>
possible to form the rear end 19b side thin in this way, it<br>
is possible to keep the center tunnel portion. 37a of the leg<br>
shield 37 low.<br>
[0084] The cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is supported by the<br>
main frame 19 having large strength. Thus, it is possible to<br>
reduce length of the main frame 19 compared with a case in which<br>
the cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is supported by the sub-frames<br>
20. Therefore, it is possible to realize a reduction in weight<br>
of the body frame 11 while securing necessary strength,<br>
[0065] The cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is supported by, in<br>
particular, a portion near the rear end of the main frasae 19,<br>
25<br><br>
that is, the rear end 19b. Thus, it is possible to reduce length<br>
of the main frame 19 and realize a further reduction in weight<br>
of the body frame 11.<br>
[0086] The front side, portions 20c of the sub-frames 20 extend<br>
substantially in parallel to the axial direction of the<br>
cylinder 12a of the engine 12. Thus, it is possible to<br>
effectively bring the front side portions 20c of the sub-frames<br>
20 close to the cylinder 12a. As a result, it is possible to<br>
reduce height of the sub-frames 20 Therefore, it is possible<br>
to keep the center tunnel portion 37a of the leg shield 37 low.<br>
[0087] The cylinder 12a of the engine 12 extends obliquely<br>
upward from the crankcase 12b. The engine 12 is formed in a<br>
shape binding upward as a whole. The bent portions 20b of the<br>
sub-frames 20 are located above the boundary portion of the<br>
cylinder 12a of the engine 12 and the crankcase 12. Thus, the<br>
sub-frames 20 are arranged along the bent shape of the engine<br>
12. Therefore, since it is possible to arrange the sub-frames<br>
20 in positions near the engine 12, it is possible to keep the<br>
center tunnel portion 37a of the leg shield 37 lower.<br>
[0088] According to the motorcycle 10, middle portions of the<br>
sub-frames 20 are bent to be recessed downward. The engine<br>
12 is supported near the bent portions 20b of the sub-frames<br>
20. Thus, it is possible to reinforce strength in the bent<br>
portions 20b of the sub-frames 20 with the engine 12. Moreover,<br>
it is possible to keep the center tunnel portion 37a of the<br>
26<br><br>
leg shield 37 lower.<br>
[0089] According to the motorcycle 10, the seat rails 31<br>
extending obliquely upward to the rear is fixed to the rear<br>
side portions 20d further on the rear side than the bent<br>
portions 20b of the sub-frames 20. Consequently, the<br>
sub-frames 20 are reinforced. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
reduce a diameter of the sub-frames 20 while securing strength<br>
of the entire body frame 11 and keep the center tunnel portion<br>
37a of the leg shield 37 lower.<br>
[0090] According to the motorcycle 10, the portions further<br>
on the rear side than the bent portions 20b of the sub-frames<br>
20 extend to the rear of the engine 12. Both the engine 12<br>
and the rear arms 26 ate supported by the rear ends 20e of the<br>
sub-frames 20 via the brackets 28. Consequently, it is<br>
possible to simplify a supporting structure for the engine 12<br>
and the like and reduce a size of the brackets 28.<br>
[0091] The front ends 31a arid 32a of the seat rails 31 and the<br>
back stays 32 extending obliquely upward to the rear are fixed<br>
to the rear ends 20e of the sub-frames 20. The seat rails 31<br>
and the back stays 32 are connected to each other on the rear<br>
end sides thereof. Consequently, it is possible to reduce a<br>
diameter of the sub-frames 20 while securing strength of the<br>
body frame 11 and keep the center tunnel portion 37a of the<br>
leg snield 37 lower.<br>
[0032] The engine 12 as supported by portions near the<br>
27<br><br>
connecting portions of the seat rails 31 and the back stays<br>
32 in the sub-frames 20. Consequently, since the engine 12<br>
is supported by portions having high strength in the sub-frames<br>
20, it is possible to reduce thickness of the sub-frames 20<br>
while securing strength of the body frame 11.<br>
[0093] The engine 12 is supported by the main frame 19 via the<br>
bracket 22 and supported by portions of two places separated<br>
to the front and the rear of the respective sub-frames 20 via<br>
the brackets 23 and the brackets 28. Thus, the engine 12 is<br>
supported by the main frame 19 and the sub-frames 20 in a<br>
well-balanced stata. The function of the engine 12 as a<br>
reinforcing member is improved to make it possible to obtain<br>
larger strength compared with a case in which the engine 12<br>
is supported by one portion of the sub-frames 20.<br>
[0094] The pair of sub-frames 20 are provided on the left and<br>
the right, respectively. The pair of brackets 26 provided in<br>
the left and the right sub-frames 20 are interposed between<br>
the rear arms 26 supporting the rear wheel 25 and the engine<br>
12 (see Fig. 3) Thus, it is possible to control an increase<br>
in an interval between the left and the right sub-frames 20<br>
and reduce a width of the vehicle while mainataining strength<br>
of the body frame 11.<br>
[0095] Incidentally, when it is assumed that the brackets 28<br>
are disposed on an outer side of the rear arms 26 and the inner<br>
cylinders 38a of the bush 38 with internal and external<br>
28<br><br>
cylinders are directly in contact with the crankcass 12lp of<br>
the engine 12, it is likely that the inner cylinders 38a made<br>
of iron cut into the crankcase 12b made of aluminum because<br>
of tightening of the nut 30 at the time of assembly. In that<br>
case, in order to prevent the inner cylinders 38a from cutting<br>
into the crankcase 12b, it is necessary to dispose washers<br>
between the inner cylinders 38a and the crarikcase 12b. However,<br>
in the motorcycle 10, the tabular brackets 23 made of iron are<br>
interposed between the inner cylinders 39a made of iron and<br>
the crankcase 12b made of aluminum. Thus, when the nut 30 is<br>
tightened, the inner cylinders 38a never cut into the crankease<br>
12b side, Therefora, since it is unnecessary to provide<br>
washers, it is possible to redues the numbar of components ,<br>
[0096] Note that, in the motorcycle 10 according to the<br>
embodiment, the pair of sub-frames 20 formed symmetrically are<br>
provided as the pair of left and right sub-frames. However,<br>
the pair of Left end right sub-frames only have to he provided<br>
on the left and the right of the vehicle and do not always have<br>
to be formed symmetrically.<br>
[0097] The motorcycle 10 according to the embodment includes<br>
the engine 12, which serves as an internal combustion engine,<br>
as the "motor". However, it goes without saying that the motor<br>
is not limited to the engine 12 and may be other motors such<br>
as an electric motor. The saddle-riding type vehicle<br>
according to the invention is not limited to the motorcycle<br>
29<br><br>
10.<br>
