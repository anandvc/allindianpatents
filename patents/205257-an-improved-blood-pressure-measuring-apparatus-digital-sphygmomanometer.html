'AN IMPROVED BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURING APPARATUS ( DIGITAL SPHYGMOMANOMETER)"<br>
                                                                    BHATE UMESH MADHAV,<br>

 PUNE-411 030, Maharashtra State, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention ORIGINAL              and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
2 0 DEC 2004	GRANTED<br>
916/MUM/2003<br>

According to the existing practice, mercurial i.e. manometer type blood pressure measuring apparatus is the most reliable, accurate form of pressure measurement. However, it requires professional skill, experience, proper stethoscope placement and calm atmosphere for careful detection and analysis of very feeble korotkoff noise to measure systolic / diastolic pressure of humanbeing from the sound pattern. Another type of apparatus known as an electronic blood pressure monitor working on principle of oscillometry method having embedded programmed software which uses algorithm to detect systolic / diastolic pressure. But this monitor also adopts the principle of calibration similar to mercurial blood pressure apparatus. All these apparatus have their merits in their construction, usage and convenience.<br>
After taking into consideration several difficulties, inconvenience and drawbacks encountered during taking human blood pressure with above said existing blood pressure instruments necessity was felt to device a mercurial blood pressure apparatus in integration with electronic circuitry for measurement and analysis of blood pressure with digital readout. Because the medical professionals are inclined to depend and rely on actual reading seen on a calibrated scale besides the mercury column.<br>
Present invention relates to an improved blood pressure measuring apparatus (Digital Sphygmomanometer) in which the entire process of inflation, deflation and analysis is controlled automatically by the smart electronic circuitry with cuff pressurization level set logically. The built-in mercury column which is functioning simultaneously, provides facility for conventional verification of blood pressure if need arises. Thus, the invention integrates the sophistication of electronic blood pressure measuring system (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring function) with the reliability of time tested mercury manometer.<br><br><br>
Object of the present invention is that the digital display should be in a position to give direct reading of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels as well as confirm the same simultaneously by visually looking at the mercurial manometer type blood pressure apparatus.<br>
Another object of this unique integration is to accomplish frequent and also periodic blood pressure measurements more efficiently than in the conventional manner. The unique integration of conventional mercury manometer working as basic reference standard device along with electronic circuitry which has a built-in micro-controller with embedded programmed software which will analyze the variations in the pulse amplitude of the mercury column and display the processed results (reliable readings of blood pressure levels) along with pulse rate on a digital readout also constitutes the significant novel feature in the present invention, thus it is possible to co-relate the digital systolic / diastolic simultaneously with conventional Hg (mercury) manometer on board the same equipment,combining the advantages of both the principles.<br>
According to this invention, therefore, an improved blood pressure measuring apparatus (Digital Sphygmomanometer) consists of a standard conventional mercurial blood pressure manometer mounted on a box prepared out of metal, plastic or such other material, and to which is connected a specially designed cuff assembly (air bag) which is provided to connect to the entire system of the apparatus so that cuff pressure variations are converted into an electrical signal; an automatic pumping system called as air pressure generating device which is incorporated for delivering or building smooth air pressure simultaneously to the mercury manometer, cuff assembly and to the pressure sensing device of this apparatus; an air pressure releasing valve in line which commands the constant release of air flow irrespective of the pressurization level when the blood pressure is being taken; air discharge valve which is normally closed is activated for releasing remaining air pressure within the system after<br><br><br>
detecting-both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, an electronic pressure sensing device for conveying variations in the pulse amplitude of mercury column to the electronic circuitry and where the above mentioned pressure related parts are interlinked with each other with the help of pneumatic pressure lines and the said electronic circuitry consists of a micro-controller based electronic circuit, a digital display to show the absolute pressure corresponding to the pressure shown on the conventional mercury column during the blood pressure measuring procedure and to finally indicate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as per analysis carried out by the aforesaid micro-controller, and there is provided a regulated power source for supplying correct supply of power through power lines to various active devices as mentioned above except for the air bag, since this air bag does not require electronic power for its operation; an electrical signal generated by pressure sensing device is connected to micro-controller based electronic circuit and digital display by a signal line.<br>
The said apparatus is having a cuff assembly consists of a cloth bag with velcro catch arrangement and a metallic ring because of which the cuff assembly gets wrapped around the arm with requisite tightness.<br>
The present invention of an improved blood pressure measuring apparatus (Digital Sphygmomanometer) has been described with the help of a schematic drawing accompanying this specification wherein salient features have been shown by suitable numerals and referred to appropriately in the following description:-<br>
Drawing comprises 1 figure.<br>
In this figure, the mercurial manometer (1), in the apparatus, is mounted on a box prepared out of metal, plastic or such other material, for measuring pressure equivalent to 300mm of Hg. is connected within the whole system. It is a well-calibrated scale besides the mercury column, widely accepted everywhere, which works on basic principle of physics. The specially designed cuff assembly (air bag) (2) is provided to connect to the entire enclosed system so that the cuff pressure variations are converted into an electrical signal.   Automatic pumping<br><br><br>
system called 'air pressure generating device' (3) is incorporated to deliver or build smooth air pressure simultaneously to the mercury manometer^ cuff assembly and to the pressure sensing device (6) of this apparatus. There is provided an air pressure releasing valve in line (4) which assists the constant airflow irrespective of the pressurization level when the system is in the measurement mode, when the power is on. Air discharge valve (normally closed valve) (5) is activated to release the remaining air pressure within the system after detecting both the blood pressure points (systolic and diastolic). Electronic pressure sensing device (6) conveys the oscillations in the pulse amplitude of the mercury column to the further electronic circuitry. The above mentioned parts are interlinked with each other with the help of pneumatic pressure lines (10). Micro¬controller based electronic circuit (7) is the key component with embedded software for instrumentation and analysis of cuff pressure variations. Digital display (8) is provided for showing absolute pressure during the measurement procedure and finally to show the results in a digital readout. This apparatus works on a regulated power source (9) which gives correct supply to the respective active devices and associated electronic circuitry by power line (11). A signal line (12) connects micro-controller based electronic circuit and digital display to the pressure sensing device.<br>
In yet another version, present invention provides electronically sensing the blood pressure in association with a dial gauge blood pressure apparatus to make the instrument still more compact, but this will offer a sort of variation in the above mentioned model.<br><br><br>
