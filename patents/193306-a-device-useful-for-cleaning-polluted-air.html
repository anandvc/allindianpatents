				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device useful for cleaning polluted<br>
air.  The device of the present Invention is particularly useful<br>
for removal of suspended particulate matter,  carbon mono-oxide<br>
(CO),  carbon d1-oxide (CO ),  nitrogen oxide (NO ),  sulpher di-<br>
2	2<br>
oxide (SO ) and aldehydes etc.  from the polluted air at traffic<br>
2 junctions,  discharge points of Industries and thermal power<br>
plants and underground workings like mines,  tunnels,  caverns,<br>
shafts etc.<br>
There has been an enormous Increase in vehicular traffic in India<br>
during the last decade with the number of vehicles exceeding 12<br>
millions,  most of which are not environment - friendly.  The air<br>
quality in a majority of the Indian cities 1s threatened due to<br>
high vehicular density and  Increasing  industrialisation.   In<br>
Delhi alone, the number of vehicles Increased from 12 thousand 1n<br>
1951 to 2.2 millions in 1993 with 2 lacs being added every    year.<br>
These vehicles are emitting 872 tons of pollutants everyday.<br>
Thermal power plants add 149 tons of SPM and 900 tons of sulphur<br>
diaoxide (SO ) everyday.  With 50 thousand Industrial  units<br>
2 adding to the pollution problems caused by the vehicular traffic<br>
and the thermal power plants,  the air pollution has reached a<br>
chaotic level with the Delhi administration advising Delhites to<br>
wear gas masks.  The level of pollution in other large Industrial<br>
cities Is approaching the pollution level of Delhi.<br>
It 1s known that air pollution 1s a serious health hazard. Most air pollutants have a direct effect on the respiratory and card1o-vascular system.  Nitrogen oxide affects the respiratory<br>
system and brain besides causing headaches and irritation of eyes, nose and throat. Lead affects bone-marrow, impairs liver and kidney function, causes neurological damage and mental retardation of children. Premature abortions have also been reported from conjested Industrial areaa^, Even the historical monuments like the Taj Mahal at Agra are, reported to be getting affected from air pollution.<br>
In view of the above scenario there 1s a need for :<br>
(i)  Large capacity pollution absorbers to be Installed at :-<br>
-	factories,<br>
-	thermal power plants, refineries etc. traffic Islands,<br>
(H) Small devices fitted to 4 wheelers and 2 wheelers. (111) Moderately sized portable devices to be used 1n underground excavations like mines, tunnels, caverns, shafts etc.<br>
Extensive use of such devices can,  therefore,  contribute significantly towards reducing the atmospheric pollution to acceptable levels.  Pollution control devices already 1n use are briefly described below : (1)  Vehiculer Traffic Pollution<br>
Vehiculer Traffic Pollution Control measures have been attempted by use of lead-free petrol or catalytic converters 1n automobiles. These attempts have achelved partial success in some of the deveioDed countries and have just started in a limited way  Inilndia in metropolitan<br>
cities only.   Besides  increasing the cost of	vehicles,<br>
these measures require an extensive network of	lead-free<br>
petrol  outlets  in the country - both in cities	and the<br>
highways for any meaningful impact.<br>
(ii) Coal Mines - Coal dust arresters and masks are in existence. But the results have not been satisfactory as drillers find it inconvenient and time consuming. Water sprinklers and Hydro Jet Cutting are other alternatives which have found very limited application due to techno-economic reasons.<br>
(111) Thermal Power Plants and Factories - SPM separators are used to precipitate SPM from smoke exhaust of thermal power plants. Similar arrangements are in vogue in factories. These require elaborate maintenance. Further, these cannot cope with gaseous pollutants.<br>
All the above measures have not found ready acceptability due to their inefficiency and practical difficulties as described above. The proposed device eliminates a majorities of these limitations.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a device useful for cleaning polluted air which obviates the drawbacks of the hIterto known devices.<br>
Another major objective of the present Invention is to provide a device for the extraction of SPM (Suspended Particulate Matter)<br>
oil, grease and other gaseous pollutants from traffic junctions, thermal power plants, factories, as well as in underground activities by a single compact unit instead of using several units at one place, each required for a definite pollutant.<br>
The schematic diagram of the embodiment of the * . device of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification. The various parts as listed below with typical dimentions and capacities should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention. These dimensions are given just as an example from a small device fabricated by the inventor to study the process.<br>
i)   Two Exhaust fans fitted in a drums for sucking in polluted<br>
air to be cleaned ii)  Drums 200  ltr.,  5 nos.  (Nos.  2,4,6,8,10,20)  shown  in<br>
Fig.1. iii)  Second forcing fan in another last drum(20)  to maintain<br>
flow of air through 5 drums used for cleaning the air.<br>
iv)  Stands - 1 no.<br>
v)   (a) Duct &amp; Socket-18 nos. Socket with<br>
9 nos. 3" dia L-shaped pipes, item 3, Fig. 1<br>
(b)	Duct &amp; Socket-18 nos. Socket with<br>
9 nos. 3" dia L-shaped pipes, Item 5, Fig. 1<br>
(c)	Duct &amp; Socket-18 nos. Socket with<br>
9 nos.. 3" dia C-shaped pipes, item 7, Fig. 1<br>
 (d)Duct &amp; Socket -18 nos. Socket with<br>
9 nos, 3" dia L-shaped pipes,<br>
item 9, Fig.l (e) Duct &amp; Socket -18 nos. Socket with<br>
9 nos, 3" dia C-shaped pipes,<br>
item 19, Fig.l (vi)     Inlets for Liquid - 2" dia pipes (Nos. 11,13,14,15)<br>
shown in Fig.l (vii) Outlets for Liquid - 2" dia pipes (Nos. 12,16,17,18) Shown in Fig.l<br>
Ducts &amp; Sockets are to carry the polluted air sucked by fan for the purpose of cleaning.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device useful for cleaning polluted air, which comprises a suction fan(l) and exhaust fan (21) being fitted on one end of a drum (2) and (20) having a plurality of ducts(3) fitted on its other end, other ends of the said ducts(3) extending to the bottom of a closed tank/drum(4) , the said tank/drum (4) has an inlet (11) and outlet (12) for filling and draining of absorbent solution such as herein described, the said tank/drum(4) being provided with a plurality of air outlet ducts(5) above the level of absorbent solution , the other end of the said ducts(5) extending to the bottom of another closed tank/drum (6), the said tank/drum (6) being provided with a plurality of air outlet ducts(7) above the level of absorbent solution, the said ducts and tank/drum combinations (3,4,5,6&amp;7) being repeated (7,8,14,17 &amp; 9,10,15,18,19,20).<br>
The tanks/drums absorb the suspended particulate matter, oil, grease etc. in water tank (4) and CO, CO2, S02 etc. are<br>
absorbed in the solutions provided in purifier tanks (6, 8 &amp; 10 etc.). The air discharged from outlet (19) of tank (10) is thus free from SPM, CO, CO , NO , SO aldehydes etc. This clean air<br>
2    2    2 is sucked through drum(20) to facilitate the movement of the air<br>
through the battery of drums (4,6,8,10,20) etc.<br>
The following are given by way of Illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention .<br>
I	-  Traffic pollution mainly consists of SPM,  lead,<br>
CO, hydro carbons, NOx, aldehydes. Lead 1s being taking care of by the use of lead-free petrol. The other impurities like SPM, aldehydes, CO, NOx can be extracted by this invention.<br>
II	-  Thermal  power plants mainly discharge CO,  CO2,<br>
 SPM,  NOx,  SO2 etc.  The Invention purifies the<br>
air of all these impurities.<br>
III	-  Coal mine pollutants are mainly methane, CO, H2S,<br>
SPM, NOx from explosives which are all) except<br>
methane and H2S,removed.  <br>
The main advantages of the device of the present invention<br>
are :<br>
1.  Reducing  atmospheric pollution  in  large cities  by<br>
installing the device at traffic Islands where emission<br>
of pollutants 1s the highest.<br>
2.	Reducing industrial pollution from factories, refineries etc by installing the proposed device at discharge points.<br>
3.	Reducing polluting emissions from thermal power plants.<br>
4.	Reducing dust pollution in mines, cement plants etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim<br>
