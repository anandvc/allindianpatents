SYSTEM FOR PROTECTION ZONE SELECTION IN<br>
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED RELAYS IN AN ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to protection zone<br>
selection systems for microprocessor-based bus protection relays,<br>
and more specifically concerns protection zone selection systems<br>
using graph/matrix theory.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In power system networks, a busline (also referred to<br>
as a busbar) provides a connection capability for various<br>
electrical circuits, including electrical generation,<br>
transmission and load circuits. If a fault occurs on a<br>
particular bus, the circuit or circuits which supply the fault<br>
current to the busline must trip their associated circuit<br>
breakers to isolate the fault from the other circuits connected<br>
to the busline. A bus fault may result in significant loss of<br>
service and, hence, busline arrangements are typically designed<br>
to minimize the number of circuits which must be opened in the<br>
event of a fault on the bus.<br>
For various reasons, including improvements in energy<br>
availability and improved flexibility in busline system<br>
operations, busline arrangements have become more complex, with<br>
more circuits and individual busses involved in a given<br>
arrangement than previously. Such complexity requires in turn<br>
more sophisticated busline protection arrangements involving<br>
selection of protection zones for the bus in accordance with the<br>
particular configuration of the busline. It is important that<br>
the protection zone selection system operate such that the<br>
protection zones correlate appropriately with the busline<br>
arrangement so that the protective relay for the bus operates<br>
only for a protection zone fault.<br><br>
In the past, both electromechanical and analog<br>
electronic relays have been vised for bus protection in electric<br>
power systems. Most uses of such relays for bus protection were<br>
and still are for relatively simple bus arrangements. With the<br>
more sophisticated, multiple bus arrangements, electromechanical<br>
relay approaches are particularly complicated, unreliable and<br>
expensive.<br>
Analog electronic bus relays, on the other hand have<br>
been more widely used than electromechanical relays to protect<br>
the more complex bus arrangements. Various approaches have been<br>
used invplving analog electronic bus relays.<br>
One apprpach uses directional comparison with a<br>
current differential scheme. In operation, the relay switches<br>
current direction signals for directional comparison and switches<br>
current transformer (CT) secondary current signals for the<br>
differential approach. However, the CT secondary current<br>
switching approach for protection zone selection may result in a<br>
hazard by virtue of an open CT secondary circuit.<br>
In another analog approach, electronic relay approach<br>
a medium impedance differential bus relay has been developed<br>
which avoids the hazards of the first approach. Switching occurs<br>
on the secondary of ratio matching CTs, eliminating an open<br>
circuit in the main CT secondary. This arrangement still<br>
requires switching trip circuits, however, even though it does<br>
eliminate CT switching.<br>
In still another approach, auxiliary relays are used<br>
to represent the various disconnect switches in the bus<br>
arrangement. Modular relays are designed to replicate the<br>
station bus components. The replica framework can then be<br>
arranged in different configurations to provide varied possible<br>
protection zone schemes for evaluation relative to different bus<br>
arrangements. However, the design and implementation of replica<br>
devices is considered to be a major drawback.<br>
In the present application, a new approach for<br>
protection zone selection is disclosed using graph/matrix theory<br>
with microprocessor-based bus relays. This new approach<br>
eliminates the disadvantages associated with the various known<br><br>
approaches described above and is applicable to any bus<br>
arrangement in power system stations.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a system for<br>
protection zone selection for a power system bus, comprising:<br>
means for receiving information concerning a bus arrangement in a<br>
power system, including the number of busses in the arrangement,<br>
and graph-based information concerning the arrangement, including<br>
the identification of vertex and edge portions of the bus<br>
arrangement, wherein said edges include disconnect circuit<br>
breakers and current, transformer (CT) branches and said branches<br>
include the busses and convergence points between disconnect<br>
branches and circuit breaker-CT branches; means for receiving the<br>
operational status of the disconnect branches and the circuit<br>
breakers, said operational status defining a selected operational<br>
configuration of the bus arrangement; a processor for<br>
establishing an incidence graph arrangement indicative of said<br>
vertexes and edges of the various vertexes, and for altering the<br>
established graph matrix based on an actual operation status of<br>
the disconnect switches and the current breakers; and means for<br>
selecting a series of protection zones covering the busses in the<br>
bus arrangement from the graph arrangement.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Bus arrangements at a power system station will<br>
typically include one or more individual busses, as well as<br>
circuit breakers, current transformers (CTs), disconnect switches<br>
and the incoming and outgoing power lines. Each of these<br>
components are typically included in what are referred to<br>
"circuit branches", which extend between selected circuit<br>
elements such as busses and other convergence points. Examples<br>
of circuit breakers include a breaker branch, a CT branch, a<br>
breaker-CT branch and a disconnect branch. A circuit breaker<br>
branch is a connection which contains a circuit breaker capable<br>
of interrupting load and fault currents. A CT branch is a<br>
connection which comprises a current transformer. The protective<br>
relay obtains digital input and current signals from the CT. A<br>
breaker-CT branch is a connection which represents a combination<br>
of a circuit breaker and a current transformer (CT). A<br><br>
disconnect branch could be a connection with a disconnect switch<br>
or a breaker branch without a CT, or other element which permits<br>
the station configuration to be changed when no load current is<br>
present. Disconnect switches are typically used, for example, to<br>
isolate parts of the bus system for maintenance and to change the<br>
connections between multiple busses.<br>
For instance, relative to system configuration, a<br>
disconnect switch can be used, when closed, to effectively<br>
combine two busses into one or, when open, to maintain two busses<br>
separate. Further, where multiple busses are involved, a<br>
breaker/CT branch can serve as a "tie-breaker" to connect two<br>
busses.<br>
A single zone of protection for a particular bus<br>
arrangement may cover a single bus or multiple busses<br>
interconnected through disconnect switches. A complex bus<br>
arrangement will typically involve several zones of protection,<br>
which will vary depending upon the particular bus arrangement<br>
configuration, which in turn will vary depending upon the pattern<br>
of open and closed disconnect switches. Bus relays must be<br>
capable of handling the various protection zone possibilities as<br>
the configuration of a particular station bus changes.<br>
The present invention uses graph/matrix theory in<br>
order to represent a power system bus arrangement in such a way<br>
that the protection zones for the bus can be readily changed to<br>
accommodate a change of configuration of the bus arrangement. In<br>
graph theory, a first plurality of locations in the bus<br>
arrangement are referred to as vertices (V1, V2, V3. . . Vn),<br>
while a second plurality of connecting elements are called edges<br>
(E1, E2. . . En) . The edges connect or link the vertices. The<br>
basic application of graph theory, specifically, the use of<br>
vertices and edges to represent a particular power system<br>
arrangement can be seen initially in Figures 1-3 and in the<br>
following explanation.<br>
Figure 1 shows a particular bus arrangement,<br>
specifically what is referred to as a sectionalized double bus<br>
arrangement with a bus tie, with a plurality of circuit breakers<br>
connected to the busses. The four busses in Figure 1 are<br><br>
indicated at 12, 14, 16 and 18. A central unit 20 portion of the<br>
protective relay for the bus communicates with seven bay units<br>
22-28 which are installed at seven breaker-CT branches,<br>
referenced at 30-36. The bay units acquire current and digital<br>
input information. The bay units send the acquired information<br>
to the central unit 20, which processes the information, makes<br>
the protection zone selection, runs the differential protection<br>
algorithms and then sends back trip instructions, if necessary,<br>
to the bay units. The bay units provide trip outputs for the<br>
circuit breakers in the associated breaker-CT branches.<br>
In the bus arrangement of Figure 1, three of the<br>
breaker-CT branches are used as bus ties to connect two busses.<br>
Breaker-CT branch 30 connects busses 12 and 16; breaker CT-branch<br>
33 connects busses 12 and 14; while breaker CT-branch 36 connects<br>
busses 14 and 18. The remaining four breaker-CT branches, i.e.<br>
31, 32, 34 and 35, terminate at the busses; breaker-CT branch 30<br>
connects to the busses 12, 16 through disconnect switches<br>
(branches) 40, 41; branch 31 connects to busses 12 and 16 through<br>
disconnect switches 43, 44; branch 32 connects to busses 12 and<br>
16 through disconnect switches 46, 47; branch 33 connects to<br>
busses 12 and 14 through disconnect switches 49, 50; branch 34<br>
connects to busses 14 and 18 through disconnect switches 52 and<br>
53; branch 35 connects to busses 14 and 18 through disconnect<br>
switches 55 and 56; and branch 36 connects to busses 14 and 18<br>
through disconnect switches 58 and 59.<br>
It should be emphasized that the particular bus<br>
arrangement shown in Figure 1 is to illustrate the use of graph<br>
theory in protection zone selection. It is, however, only one<br>
bus arrangement out of many possible. Graph theory as explained<br>
relative to Figure 1 can be used for basically any bus<br>
arrangement.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first step in the use of graph theory<br>
relative to protection zone selection for a bus. Figure 2<br>
identifies certain points as vertices. In particular, each<br>
vertex represents a bus, a branch convergence point or branch<br>
termination point. In the bus arrangement of Figure 1, each of<br>
the busses 12, 14, 16 and 18 represents a single vertex. The<br><br>
convergence points between disconnect branches and breaker-CT<br>
branches are also vertices, as are branch termination points. In<br>
the embodiment shown, these vertices are indicated at 66-73, with<br>
vertices 66-69 being convergent points between breaker-CT<br>
branches and disconnect branches, while vertices 70-73 are at<br>
termination points in the bus arrangement. The identification of<br>
the vertices is clear and straightforward relative to Figure 1,<br>
following the definition of a vertex outlined above. The same<br>
vertex identification approach is valid for virtually any bus<br>
arrangement.<br>
The next step in applying graph theory to the system<br>
of Figure 1 is the identification of edges which represent the<br>
various branches of the system, extending between the vertices.<br>
This is shown in Figure 3. Again, the various possible branches<br>
are breaker branches, CT branches, breaker-CT branches and<br>
disconnect branches. In Figure 3, branches 74, 75, 76, 77, 78,<br>
91 and 92 are breaker-CT branches; branches 82-85, 87-90 and 93<br>
are all disconnect branches. Figure 3 shows the bus arrangement<br>
of Figure 1 converted into a graphic representation comprising<br>
vertices and edges in accordance with the definitions thereof<br>
provided above.<br>
Each of the individual edges which connect the<br>
vertices have a reference direction, which can be selected either<br>
arbitrarily or assigned according to the CT polarity for the CT<br>
branches. In the present case, a negative sign indicates an edge<br>
extending away from the vertex, while no sign indicates an edge<br>
extending toward the vertex.<br>
The operational status of the disconnect branches,<br>
i.e. either opened or closed, defines the particular bus<br>
configuration for which the protection zone configuration is<br>
determined. At different points in time, the bus configuration<br>
will change, depending upon the particular status of the various<br>
disconnect switches, which are controlled by the system operator.<br>
As mentioned above, the bus system configuration changes when, as<br>
one example, certain portions of the bus arrangement are<br>
temporarily isolated for maintenance. Selected disconnect<br>
switches are opened to produce the desired isolation. Other bus<br><br>
configurations result because of a different arrangement of the<br>
individual buslines as they are either connected together or<br>
maintained separated. Other system operational considerations<br>
will produce other bus configurations produced by different<br>
patterns of disconnect switch closures, as controlled by the<br>
system operator.<br>
Particular examples of various configurations of the<br>
bus arrangement of Figure 1, with their corresponding effect upon<br>
the resulting graph representation, relative to the initial<br>
representation shown in Figure 3, and the resulting protection<br>
zone configuration, are discussed below. It should be noted that<br>
the arrangement of figure 1 does not include separate breaker<br>
branches or separate CT branches. Accordingly, no edges in<br>
Figure 3 represents those two particular possible branch types.<br>
However, it should be understood that other bus arrangements<br>
could include such branches. Appropriate edges would be used to<br>
represent the breaker branches and the CT branches.<br>
The following describes graph operations as they are<br>
used to produce protection zone selection for a various<br>
configurations of the particular bus arrangement of Figure 1. In<br>
a graph approach (Figure 3) which represents the bus arrangement<br>
of Figure 1, the various edges are classified either as switching<br>
edges or weighted edges. Switching edges basically are the<br>
disconnect branches, while weighted edges are the breaker CT<br>
branches. Further; the various vertices are categorized as either<br>
bus vertices, i.e. those vertices which identify actual busses,<br>
and all other vertices, which are indicated to be non-bus<br>
vertices. Graph operations in the present system are performed<br>
only on switching edges and bus vertices.<br>
Figure 4 shows the actual graphical equivalent of the<br>
bus arrangement of Figures 1 and 3, using the definition of<br>
vertices and edges as defined above. The first graph operation<br>
performed in order to determine an appropriate protection zone<br>
arrangement for the bus arrangement of Figure 1 is on the<br>
switching edges. If a particular disconnect in a switching edge<br>
is opened by the operation, the corresponding graph operation is<br>
the removal of that particular edge, i.e. that edge is removed<br><br>
from the graph representation. Various selected switches are<br>
opened by the system operator for selected system operations,<br>
resulting in a selected bus configuration.<br>
Figure 5 shows the basic graph of Figure 4, with<br>
switching edges 82, 85, 87, 90 and 93 open, i.e. removed from the<br>
graph of Figure 3. This is by way of one example; the actual<br>
switching edges to be removed from a basic graph depends upon the<br>
decisions of the system operator to achieve a particular bus<br>
configuration.<br>
A second graph operation involves the switching edges<br>
(the disconnect branches) which are closed (i.e. normal<br>
operation). When a switching edge is closed, that edge<br>
"contracts", under graph theory, resulting in the merging of the<br>
two vertices at the respective ends of the edge, so as to produce<br>
a new single, combined vertex. A new "combined" vertex replaces<br>
the two original vertices. All of the edges which were incident<br>
at the original two vertices are now incident at the new,<br>
combined vertex. As an example, Figure 6 shows a modified Figure<br>
5 graph where original switching edges 83, 84, 88 and 89 (Figure<br>
4) are closed. Hence, in accordance with the above-described<br>
graph operations, vertices 62 and 66 (Figure 5) can be combined,<br>
as can vertices 64 and 67, vertices 63 and 68, and vertices 65<br>
and 69. Figure 6 shows the graphical result of the selected<br>
edges being closed and the appropriate vertices merged. As can<br>
be seen, Figure 6 is a significant simplification of the original<br>
graph representation of Figure 3, for the bus arrangement of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
With respect to the determination of protection zones,<br>
if a particular bus vertex is not connected to any other bus<br>
vertices via switching edges, then that bus vertex will be<br>
selected as being within a single protection zone. That single<br>
zone covers all the set of edges incident on that bus vertex. If<br>
two bus vertices are end points of a particular edge which<br>
represents a closed disconnect branch, then a new incident set of<br>
edges on the combined vertex includes all of the edges which were<br>
incident initially on the two vertices; however, it does not<br>
include those which are originally incident on both vertices.<br><br>
In Figure 5, the two vertices 62, 66 define a single<br>
protection zone incorporating all of the incident edges thereon.<br>
The same is true for vertices 64 and 67, vertices 63 and 68, and<br>
vertices 65 and 69. From Figure 6, vertices 62 and 66 form a<br>
combined vertex 100, vertices 64 and 67 form a combined vertex<br>
102, vertices 63 and 68 form a combined vertex 104, and vertices<br>
65 and 69 form a combined vertex 106. Zone 1 protection thus<br>
includes vertex 100 with incident switching edges 74, 75 and -92<br>
(note reference direction is negative for the edge extending away<br>
from the vertex); Zone 2 is the combined vertex 104, with<br>
incident switching edges 92, 77 and 91; Zone 3 is combined vertex<br>
102, with switching edges -74 and 76; while Zone 4 is combined<br>
vertex 106, with incident edges -91 and 78.<br>
An example involving a further graph operation on<br>
Figure 6 includes the closing of another switching edge, i.e.<br>
edge 93 (see Figure 4), which was previously open. All other<br>
switches have the same configuration. The graph result is shown<br>
in Figure 7. In Figure 7 switching edge 93 (Figure 4) contracts,<br>
merging combined bus vertices 102 and 106 of Figure 6 into a new<br>
bus vertex 110. The protection zone selection then changes to<br>
accommodate the new bus configuration. Zone 1 covers vertex 100<br>
with incident edges 74, 75 and -92; Zone 2 covers vertex 104 with<br>
incident edges 77, 91 and 92; and Zone 3 covers vertex 110, with<br>
incident edges -74, 76, 78 and -91. Since previous bus vertices<br>
102 and 106 have been further combined into new bus vertex 110,<br>
only three zones of protection are necessary (all the bus<br>
vertices have been covered) and Zone 4 is thus zero.<br>
A further example involves an evolution of the<br>
arrangement of Figure 7 by closing another edge 82 (see Figure<br>
4) . The closing of edge 82 (previously open) will result in<br>
combined vertices 100 and 110 contracting into a single new<br>
vertex 112. In this arrangement, shown in Figure 8, with only<br>
two vertices left, there are only two zones of protection. Zone<br>
1, covering bus vertex 112, has the following incident edges:<br>
75, 76, 78, -91 and -92, while Zone 2, covering vertex 104, has<br>
incident edges of 77, 91, and 92.<br><br>
Thus, several examples have been given of how graph<br>
theory results in the selection of zones of protection for<br>
various bus system configurations.<br>
The following explanation is directed toward the use<br>
of graph theory to develop a corresponding matrix which can be<br>
used by a microprocessor to automatically select the zones of<br>
protection. A graph with several vertices and edges, such as<br>
Figure 4, can be converted into a matrix having the same number<br>
of rows as vertices, and the same number of columns as edges.<br>
The combination of the rows and the columns forms an incidence<br>
matrix. . The resulting incidence matrix is in fact the<br>
coefficient matrix of Kirchhoff's current equations in electric<br>
power networks. The matrix is thus of significant interest<br>
relative to bus differential protection in microprocessor based<br>
relays, because the relay can establish the zones of protection<br>
and then perform its differential current comparisons to detect<br>
faults in the selected zones.<br>
In a matrix, each row of a matrix represents a vertex<br>
in the system and the incident set of edges corresponding to that<br>
vertex. In a matrix, if a switching edge is open, the column<br>
positions corresponding to that particular edge (for all the<br>
vertices on which it is incident) are zero, while if the<br>
switching edge is closed, the column positions are in effect<br>
first set to one and then a contracting operation is performed<br>
(similar to the operations shown in Figures 5-8. In matrix<br>
operations, the rows representing the two end point vertices for<br>
the closed edge are combined, with the originating vertex row<br>
being deleted. In this way, the matrix is simplified (the rows<br>
are reduced) in the same way that the graph representation is<br>
simplified.<br>
Figure 9 shows the basic concept of the matrix prior<br>
to any graphing operations (similar to the graph of Figure 4 for<br>
graphical representation). The rows represent the twelve<br>
vertices of Figure 2, (only these are actually shown) while the<br>
columns represent the 16 possible edges. In Figure 9, the<br>
incident edges for each vertex are represented by the numerals of<br><br>
the edges of Figure 3. All the other positions in the matrix are<br>
set to zero.<br>
Now, again, using the same configuration of Figures 5<br>
and 6, the matrix position of switching edges 82, 85, 87, 90 and<br>
93 are set to be open (those positions are set to zero), while<br>
switching edges 83, 84, 88 and 89 are closed. Contracting<br>
operations are performed for the closed edges for the matrix,<br>
leading to the matrix of Figure 10, which has 4 vertices<br>
remaining. Vertex row 100 in the new matrix are original vertex<br>
rows 62 and 66; Vertex row 104 represents the combining of<br>
original vertex rows 63 and 68; vertex row 102 represents the<br>
combining of original vertex rows 64 and 67; while vertex row 106<br>
represents the combining of original vertex rows 65 and 69.<br>
Since, as indicated above, zones of protection cover<br>
only bus vertices, the selected Zones 1-4 cover, respectively,<br>
combined vertex 100 and weighted edges 74, 75 and -92 (Zone 1) ;<br>
combined vertex 104 and weighted edges 77, 91 and 92 (Zone 2);<br>
vertex 102 and weighted incident edges -74 and 76 (Zone 3) ; and<br>
combined vertex 106 and weighted incident edges 78 and -91 (Zone<br>
4). Since, as explained above, incident edges on the bus<br>
vertices are only weighted edges 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 91 and 92,<br>
the switching edges 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90 and 93 are all<br>
zeros in the matrix.<br>
In another matrix example (Figure 11), similar to the<br>
example shown in Figure 8 for the graph approach, switching edges<br>
82 and 93 are closed, which results in two more rows being<br>
contracted, leaving two new combined vertices 112 and 104<br>
remaining, similar to that for Figure 8. The closing of the<br>
switches will change the bus arrangement and the configuration of<br>
the matrix, as shown in Figure 11. The zones of protection will<br>
change accordingly, with incident edges for Zone 1 being 75, 76,<br>
78, -91 and -92 and Zone 2 being 77, 91 and 92. Matrix<br>
arrangements, i.e. Figures 9, 10, and 11, can be processed<br>
automatically in the relay to produce zones of protection. Thus,<br>
the advantage of the matrix approach of Figures 9-11 which is<br>
basically equivalent to the traditional graphical representation<br><br>
of Figures 6-8, is that it is appropriate for use with<br>
microprocessor-based relays.<br>
Implementation of graph-based zone selection is useful<br>
in microprocessor-based relays as follows: Microprocessor-based<br>
bus relay have common protection functions: bus protection,<br>
breaker failure protection and protection zone selection. Zone<br>
selection is a basic function in both bus and breaker failure<br>
protection schemes. As indicated above, accurate protection zone<br>
selection ensures that the protective relay operates according to<br>
Kirchhoff's current law in choosing input currents for<br>
differential protection. Zone selection also determines the<br>
particular circuit breakers to trip in the event of a bus fault<br>
or an associated breaker failure. Graph-type operation is a tool<br>
which can be used for step-by-step, graphical-type hand<br>
manipulation of the bus arrangement and provides a comprehendible<br>
picture of the power system station and its operation. Matrix-<br>
type operation, using the same graphing principles, is suitable<br>
for microprocessor-based operation and processing.<br>
The following describes the use of matrix-type<br>
operation to implement protection zone selection. Figure 12 is a<br>
block diagram showing the basic processing steps for matrix-type<br>
graph processing. In a first step, referred to at 120, the<br>
incidence vector information for all vertices is provided. All<br>
edges incident at each of the vertices are entered, with the<br>
actual status of the disconnect switches and circuit breakers<br>
being represented. In the incidence matrix, which is established<br>
before any specific bus configuration is implemented, if the<br>
direction of the edge is away from the associated vertex, then a<br>
negative sign appears before the edge position in the matrix. If<br>
the edge is toward the vertex then no sign appears.<br>
In block 122, the information for all of the edges,<br>
i.e. the status of the disconnect switches (open or closed) is<br>
provided to the processor. In the protective relay, logic<br>
equations express the condition of each edge. If all the<br>
switching devices in an edge are closed, the edge is considered<br>
by the logic equation as being closed. On the other hand, if any<br><br>
one switching device in an edge is open, the edge is considered<br>
by the logic equation as being open.<br>
After the matrix has been constructed and the edges<br>
defined, then it is first determined whether any switching<br>
operations are to be performed on the matrix, as indicated by<br>
block 124. If the matrix is to have a different configuration,<br>
because of a change in the status of one or more of selected<br>
disconnect switches, due to the decision of the system operator,<br>
then the logic equation for each corresponding edge will be<br>
carried out, as indicated by block 126.<br>
In block 128, the actual graph operations are<br>
performed, corresponding to the open edges and closed edges<br>
defined by the logic equations. Vertices are contracted where<br>
the edges have been closed. The bay units for each protection<br>
zone are then selected (block 130), followed by the application<br>
of any zone supervision logic. The resulting selected protection<br>
zones are then provided as an output to the relay for use in its<br>
current differential fault analysis.<br>
The selected protection zones each include a bus or<br>
busses, depending on the graph operations performed, as well as<br>
associated bay units. The relay processor runs the matrix<br>
algorithm every time the system operator changes the<br>
configuration of the bus arrangement.<br>
The protection zone selection system of the present<br>
invention also includes logic equations for supervision of the<br>
selection process. The logic equations provide threshold<br>
requirements and flexibility for the selection process. Zone<br>
supervision is useful for complicated bus arrangements because it<br>
provides supervision of zone selection without using switch<br>
status information but using other digital input relay<br>
information. For each zone, there is a corresponding threshold<br>
or logic control equation. The relay will check the output of<br>
each logic control equation for each zone selection. If the<br>
output of the logic circuit is one, there is no supervision to<br>
the corresponding zone, while if the logic output equals zero,<br>
the relay will block the associated zone. An example of a logic<br>
control equation for zone supervision is Zs (zone supervision) =<br><br>
27ABC, where 27 ABC represents a phase A, B or C undervoltage<br>
condition.<br>
The present invention also includes the use of "check<br>
zones" for additional protection zone supervision. Check zone<br>
supervision does not depend on disconnect switch status<br>
information. The check zone supervision is a list of the active<br>
bay units. In the case of the arrangement of Figure 1, the<br>
selected active bay units after the interconnects have been<br>
entered (Figure 3) are bay units 23, 24, 26, and 27, which<br>
correspond to edges 31, 33, 34 and 35. The check zone element<br>
responds to faults in all of the zones but cannot determine the<br>
specific zone of protection in which the fault occurs.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the output of the bus zone<br>
differential element, in the protective relay, is combined with<br>
the output of the check zone differential element through an AND<br>
gate. If the output of both of the elements are high, indicating<br>
a fault determination from the bus zone protection (using the<br>
selected zones produced by the system herein and the check zone<br>
differential elements), then an output is asserted which results<br>
in tripping of the circuit breaker for a particular zone. The<br>
overall system flow is shown in Figure 13. The status of the<br>
circuit breakers and the disconnect switches in the bus<br>
arrangement (block 140) is provided in the zone selection<br>
processing circuit 142 and the zone supervision processor 144.<br>
The zone selection processor 142 also receives bus arrangement<br>
information (block 146). The zone selection processor determines<br>
vertices and edges, establishes a matrix, completes graph<br>
operations and establishes zones of protection (block 148) . Zone<br>
supervision circuit 144 is responsive to breaker and disconnect<br>
switch status information (block 140) and other bus inputs (block<br>
150) to accomplish the zone supervision through logic equations<br>
(153) and zone supervision (155) functions.<br>
The bus arrangement information is used to determine<br>
the bay unit arrangement (block 152) and the check zones (block<br>
154) , the output of which is applied to an AND gate 156 along<br>
with the output of the protective zone determination to produce a<br>
"trip" output, if necessary, of the differential relay.<br><br>
The following is one specific example of the use of<br>
the zone selection system of the present invention to provide<br>
differential protection for a bus arrangement. As discussed<br>
above, Figure 4 is a graphical representation of the bus<br>
arrangement of Figure 1. The setting format for the incident<br>
edges on the various vertices is shown in the table of Figure 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 1-3, each of the edges has. specific switch<br>
elements (one or more) in its branch. For instance, edge 74,<br>
which is a tie breaker connecting busses 12 and 16, includes two<br>
disconnects 40 and 41 and a circuit breaker-CT 30. Edge 75,<br>
which extends between vertices 66 and 70 includes a breaker-CT<br>
branch 31. The information of Figure 1 concerning the<br>
composition of each of the edges is entered into the processor.<br>
With this information entered, various operational<br>
configurations, involving different switch status arrangements,<br>
can be processed.<br>
In an example for the graph of Figures 5 and 6, Figure 14<br>
shows the basic setting for the incidence vectors of Figure 4.<br>
Edges 93, 82, 85, 87, and 90 are opened by disconnect switches,<br>
with all the circuit breakers being closed. The result, in<br>
graph form, is shown in Figures 5 and 6. Four zones of<br>
protection are created relative to bay units. The first zone<br>
for vertex 100, with incidence edges 75, 74 and -92, thus<br>
includes associated bay units 22, 23 and -25 (breaker-CT<br>
branches 30, 31 and 33); the second zone (vertex 104, edges 92,<br>
91 and 77) includes bay units 26, 25, and 28 (breaker-CT braches<br>
34, 33 and 36); the third zone (vertex 102, edges 76, -74,<br>
includes bay units -22 and 24 (breaker-CT branches 30 and 32) ;<br>
and the fourth zone (vertex 106, edges 78 -91 includes bay units<br>
27 and -28 (breaker-CT breakers 35 and 36).<br>
Hence, the zones of protection for Figure 14 and the<br>
differential relay are characterized in terms of bay units<br>
associated with breaker-CT branches. Each of the bay units is<br>
responsive to faults detected in its zone. The check zone bay<br>
units for this example are 23, 24, 26 and 27. The check zones<br>
provide a supervision for the protection zone selection, as<br>
discussed above.<br><br>
In another example, switches 47, 52, 56 and 51 in<br>
Figure 1 are all opened by the system operator, in order to<br>
transfer branch 31 from bus 12 to bus 16. The busses 12 and 16<br>
are solidly linked by switches 43 and 44 during the transfer<br>
period. Using graph operations, the resulting zone selection is<br>
as follows: Zone 1 covers bay units 23, 24 and -25; Zone 2<br>
covers bay units 25, 26 and 28; and Zone 4 covers bay units 27<br>
and -28. In this case, two busses 12 and 16 are covered by Zone<br>
2, so there is no Zone 3. During the transfer period, breaker<br>
bay unit 22 is not included in the two-bus protection zone.<br>
The check zone differential elements for this example<br>
are the same as for. the previous example, since the basic bus<br>
arrangement is the same, even though the switch configuration is<br>
different. Other specific switch configurations for other system<br>
conditions, involving other combinations of disconnect switches<br>
being open/closed, will result in other protection zone selection<br>
results.<br>
Figure 15 is a diagram of a second particular bus<br>
arrangement, involving a double bus/single breaker arrangement,<br>
with a bypass line switch. This arrangement provides greater<br>
flexibility for power system operations than the arrangement of<br>
Figure 1. Either bus in the system of Figure 15 provides service<br>
to any line. Further, the busses can operate together or<br>
independently; one bus in addition can act as a transfer bus if a<br>
line breaker is out of service.<br>
Figure 16 is a graph representation for the bus<br>
arrangement of Figure 15, including six vertices 180-185 and<br>
seven edges, 190-196, shown with reference direction for each<br>
edge. Vertices 180 and 181 represent the two busses 188, 190.<br>
Vertices 182 and 183 are the convergence points between the<br>
disconnect branches and breaker CT branches. Vertices 184 and<br>
185 are termination points for two of the breaker CT branches 200<br>
and 202. Edges 190 through 192 represent the breaker CT branches<br>
200, 202 and 204, while edges 193 through 196 represent<br>
disconnect branches associated with vertices 180, 181, 182 and<br>
183. There are three bay units, 220, 222 and 224, associated,<br><br>
respectively, with breaker-CT branches 200, 202 and 204, and a<br>
central unit 230.<br>
In operation, information is entered into the<br>
processor concerning each of the vertices and each of the edges,<br>
with their associated switches. When one or more switches are<br>
opened to produce a particular system configuration, zones of<br>
protection are automatically selected, using bay units<br>
designations. Check zone supervision is added if necessary. In<br>
one specific operational example, all circuit breakers are<br>
closed, and disconnect switches 210, 212, 213 and 214 (Figure 15)<br>
are open, with the remaining disconnect switches being closed.<br>
This means that using the logic equation defining the condition<br>
of the edges, edges 194, 190 and 195 and 191 will be open. Zone<br>
1 will protect bus 190, using bay units 220 and -224, while Zone<br>
2 will cover bus 188 using bay units 222 and 224.<br>
Hence, a new system for representing complex bus<br>
arrangements has been disclosed which makes possible automatic<br>
processing for protection zone selection. Each of the protection<br>
zones has associated therewith bay units which in combination<br>
with a central unit produce the differential current<br>
determination for each zone of protection. The zone<br>
determination can, if desired, be supervised by traditional zone<br>
differential elements so as to provide a reliable output for<br>
tripping action. .<br>
Although a preferred embodiment has been disclosed for<br>
purposes of illustration, it should be understood that various<br>
changes, modifications and substitutions can be made without<br>
departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined by<br>
the claims which follow:<br><br>
