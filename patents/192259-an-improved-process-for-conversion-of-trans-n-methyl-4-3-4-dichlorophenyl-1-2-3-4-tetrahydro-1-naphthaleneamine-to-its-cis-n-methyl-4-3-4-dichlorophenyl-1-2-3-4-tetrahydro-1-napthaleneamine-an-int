				<td>An Improved Process for Conversion of trans-N-methyl-4- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthaleneamine to its cis- N-methyl-4- (3,4-diclilorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine (An intermediate of Sertraline hydrochloride)<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for converting trans isomer of N-methyl-4- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthaleneamine to corresponding cis isomeric product. The cis isomer serves as a valuable intermediate in the production of cis (lS)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphlhaIcncaminc hydrochloride (Scrtraline hydrochloride), which is a potent anti-depressant agent. Background of Invention<br>
US Pat. No. 5,082,970 describes a process for converting trans isomer of N-methyl-4(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthalenamine (in absence or presence of up to an equal part by weight of cis isomer) to the related cis isomeric product. The conversion is conducted in the presence of a basic equilibrium agent as an alkali metal alkoxide in an inert polar solvent.<br>
The synthetic procedure as disclosed is aforementioned US Pat No. 5,082,970, for conversion of trans-N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthalen-eamine to desired cis-N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthalene-amine involves the use of expensive and water incompatible alkali metal alkoxide, as potassium tertiary butoxide. The reaction is conducted in solvent, like tetrahydrofuran, which is not well suited for commercial scale up. Distillation of tetrahydrofuran at industrial scale, may lead as hazards as explosion.<br><br>
The patent also embodies elaborate workup process. For instance, upon completion of reaction, tetrahydrofuran is distilled under reduced pressure and the residue obtained is dissolved in halogenated solvent. This is accompanied by water washing and drying of organic layer. Redistillation of organic layer is again followed by redissolution of oil in tetrahydrofuran. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas is then passed after which cis isomer precipitates out as a crystalline hydrochloride salt.<br>
The multistep workup coupled with use of expensive reagents and solvents like potassium tertiary butoxide and tetrahydrofuran together with an additional step for generation of hydrogen chloride gas makes the process hazardous, expensive and less commercially viable. Summary of invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is now provided a new, simple and improved process for conversion of trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine to corresponding cis isomeric product.<br>
This conversion of trans isomer to cis isomer is affected in an aromatic non-polar solvent containing lower metal alkoxide and tertiary butanol.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention the conversion of trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphtheleneamine to cis isomer is achieved in the presence of alkali metal hydroxide and tertiary butanol in aromatic non-polar organic solvent.<br>
The present invention describes the preferable usage of cheap and commercially available alkali metal hydroxide over lower metal alkoxide, which is described in US Pat. 5, 082, 970. The present invention also incorporates use of inexpensive non-polar solvents like toluene and xylene, which are recovered and reused making the process inexpensive and environment<br><br>
friendly. Moreover this invention discloses usage of concentrated hydrochloric acid, over<br>
anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas (usage of which described in US Pat. No. 5,082,97) during<br>
workup.<br>
As Sertraline hydrochloride is a useful anti-depressant agent it is very important to have a cost<br>
effective, commercially viable and environment friendly process for its preparation.<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to utilize unwanted trans isomer co<br>
produced during synthesis of Sertraline hydrochloride, convert it into valuable, cis isomer by<br>
cost effective, industrially scaleable and environment friendly process.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention, describes a new and improved process for converting trans<br>
isomer   of   N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphthaleneamine   or   its<br>
hydrochloride salt to the corresponding is isomeric product which comprises:<br>
a.	contacting trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyI)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1 -<br>
naphthaleneamine or its hydrochloride salt in alkali metal hydroxide selected from<br>
potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in tertiary butanol and aromatic non-polar<br>
solvent, selected from toluene or xylene;<br>
b.	heating the reaction solution to reflux at a temperature ranging from 80 tol 10°C for a<br>
period of 15 to 60 hours till the reaction is substantially complete;<br>

d.	subsequently stirring the reaction mass for 30 minutes at 30-35°C after which the<br>
organic layer is separated from biphasic system, water washed and cooled to 5-15°C;<br><br>
e. acidifying the organic layer obtained in step (d) with conc, hydrochloric acid to precipitate the desired cis isomer as hydrochloride salt, together with trans isomeric impurity;<br>
f    stirring the precipitated salt for 30 minutes at 20°C accompanied by filtration;<br>
g. stirring the wet cake in alcohol at reflux temperature for a period of 1 to 5 hours and then cooling to 0-5°C and maintaining for 30 minutes at the same temperature;<br>
h.   filtering the suspension and washing with/without chilled alcohol rendering desired cis isomer. According to another embodiment of the present invention the conversion of trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-naphlhalcneamine or its hydrochloride salt to the corresponding cis isomeric product comprises:<br>
a.	contacting trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-<br>
naphthaleneamine or its hydrochloride salt with an alkali metal alkoxide selected from<br>
sodium butoxide or potassium tertiary butoxide, in presence of tertiary butanol and<br>
aromatic non-polar solvent selected from toluene or xylene,<br>
b.	refluxing the reaction solution at a temperature ranging from 80 to 110 °C for a period<br>
of 15 to 60 hours until the desired conversion is substantially complete,<br>
c.	cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature and further cooling to 0 to 10°C<br>
followed by dilution with water,<br>
d.	separating the organic layer from the resultant biphasic system, and distilling the<br>
solvent to half of the volume under reduced pressure, washing with water and cooling<br>
to 5-10°C,<br><br>
e.   acidifying the suspension obtained in step (d) with hydrochloric acid to precipitate the<br>
desired, cis isomer as hydrochloride salt containing trans isomer as impurity, f   purifying the obtained isomer by recrystallisation in alcohol which comprises, i.    dissolving the isomer in alcohol the amount of isomer to alcohol being  1:5-30<br>
times, ii.  heating the suspension to reflux at 60-65°C, iii. subsequently subjecting the solution to carbon treatment accompanied by filtration. The<br>
filtrate on evaporation to half of its volume followed by cooling to 5-10°C, iv.   subjecting the resultant suspension to filtration and washing with without methanol<br>
where after pure cis isomer isolated while the corresponding trans isomer remains in<br>
solution.<br>
The present invention, hence, provides a simple, novel process for conversion of trans isomeric N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthaleneamine or its hydrochloride salt to the corresponding cis isomeric product, which involves:<br>
i.	replacement   of  water   incompatible   metal   alkoxide   with   cheap,   safe   and<br>
commercially available, alkali hydroxide<br>
ii.	substitution of hazardous tetrahydrofuran with inexpensive aromatic non polar<br>
solvent which is recovered and reused iii.       replacing anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas with cheap and commercially available<br>
hydrochloric acid and iv.        Overall providing a simple work-up procedure.<br><br>
Keeping in view, the above mentioned facts, the present invcntion hence, delivers a simple, improved cost effective, industrially scaleable and environment friendly process for converting trans isomer of N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro naphthaleneamine to corresponding cis isomeric product.<br>
It is noteworthy to mention the trans isomeric N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro naphthaleneamine is obtained as per procedure described in US 4, 536, 518.<br>
