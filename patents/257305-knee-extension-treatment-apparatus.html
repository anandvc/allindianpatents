KNEE EXTENSION TREATMENT APPARATUS<br>
REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
The present application is the International Application of a continuation-<br>
in-part patent application of United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/237,812, filed September 9,2002, entitled "Knee Extension Therapy<br>
Apparatus", which is now pending and which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to treatment devices that are used<br>
to assist with and facilitate the healing and recovery of a patient-user. Such<br>
treatment devices may be used before or after surgery or in lieu of surgery. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to a knee extension treatment apparatus<br>
that assists the patient-user with exercising and stretching before and/or following â€¢<br>
knee surgery. In other instances, the treatment apparatus according to the present<br>
invention may be used in lieu of surgery.<br>
It is important that patients recovering from knee surgery initiate knee<br>
exercise/ stretching treatment promptly after surgery to maintain knee joint<br>
flexibility and shorten the period for recovery. Patient compliance with a<br>
predetermined physical treatment protocol is key to early patient recovery with<br>
optimal joint flexibility and function. In certain situations, benefits are derived by<br>
following a knee treatment protocol before surgery. In other situations, a knee<br>
treatment protocol may be used in lieu of surgery. While there have been many<br>
devices developed to provide knee extension and exercise treatment, each has its<br>
complexities or difficulties of use that have tended to reduce patient compliance<br>
with therapeutic or treatment protocols designed for early and effective recovery.<br>
The present invention provides a knee extension treatment apparatus that<br>
can be easily transported for patient home use, and one that can be used by the<br>
postoperative or post-trauma patient with minimal instruction and without<br>
assistance of attending medical practitioners, family members or friends.<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
2<br>
Similarly, the treatment apparatus may be used before or in lieu of surgery. The<br>
present invention provides a simple, effective, user adaptable knee extension<br>
treatment apparatus. The apparatus is configured to allow the patient-user to lie in<br>
a comfortable recumbent position during each treatment session. The apparatus<br>
provides an easy-to-use force translation system for efficient and effective delivery<br>
of knee straightening forces to areas on the top of the patient's leg. One earlier<br>
knee extension treatment apparatus is disclosed in the patent application of<br>
Callanan et al., U .S. Serial No. 10/237,812, filed September 9, 2002, now<br>
pending. The Callanan et al. patent application is expressly incorporated by<br>
reference herein for its entire disclosure.<br>
The Callanan et al. invention provides a knee extension treatment apparatus<br>
for use by a patient in a recumbent position. The patient's hip corresponding to the<br>
leg requiring treatment rests on the surface of a base component of the apparatus.<br>
The leg requiring extension treatment is elevated to a level above the surface upon<br>
which the patient user is resting and is held in position by a height adjustable<br>
elevated ankle support. The apparatus is preferably designed to be collapsible into<br>
an easily transported unit so that it can be used by the patient at home. The<br>
apparatus includes a base having a patient user proximal surface for supporting the<br>
patient user's hip and a user distal portion. The apparatus also includes an ankle<br>
support member, preferably one of adjustable height mounted on a user distal<br>
portion of the base. The apparatus also includes a pulley system for translating a<br>
force applied toward the user proximal end of the base and having a major vector<br>
component parallel to the surface of the base to a force having a major vector<br>
component substantially orthogonal to the base. The pulley system is designed to<br>
maintain the tension in the system resulting from the patient applied force. In one<br>
embodiment the pulley system enables the applied force to be translated into a<br>
mechanically advantaged force having a major component substantially orthogonal<br>
to the base. The apparatus also includes a force transmitting element for engaging<br>
both knee proximal and knee distal portions of the patient's<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
3<br>
elevated leg. The force transmitting element has at least one user engageable/<br>
disengageable connector for attaching the element to the pulley system for<br>
applying the translated based-orthogonal force to areas on the upper surface of the<br>
patient's elevated leg proximal and distal of the elevated knee which applied forces<br>
tend to straighten the leg and extend the knee joint.<br>
While the earlier Callanan et al. invention is described in the application of<br>
U.S. Serial No. 10/237,812 as being collapsible into a "compact, easily transported<br>
unit", there is some degree of complexity in view of the various pulleys, cables,<br>
and the ankle support that all have to be disassembled and then reassembled in<br>
order to achieve the concept of being collapsible. The present inventors<br>
envisioned that improvements could be made to the Callanan et al. structure if the<br>
complexity could be reduced and if the new design could be made easier in terms<br>
of collapsibility, transporting, storage, and/or set up. Changing to lighter weight<br>
materials would add to the convenience of this device so long as the overall<br>
structure could be designed with sufficient strength and durability while still using<br>
these lighter weight materials, such as tubular metal framing or molded plastic. A<br>
further improvement envisioned by the present inventors is to make the collapsed<br>
size smaller, thereby making both transport and storage of the apparatus easier.<br>
Further, it was envisioned by the present inventors that the pulley mechanism of<br>
Callanan et al. could be simplified while retaining the ratchet tightening feature<br>
that is under the control of the user by means of a pull cable connected to<br>
tightening straps placed over the leg on opposite sides of the knee.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A knee extension treatment apparatus for applying a downward force to an<br>
upper surface of a user's leg while the leg is supported by the knee extension<br>
treatment apparatus, for facilitating the straightening of the leg when bent at the<br>
knee, according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises a base<br>
frame assembly, an ankle support connected to the base frame assembly, first and<br>
second strap assemblies secured to the base frame assembly, each strap assembly<br>
being secured at one end and constructed and arranged to lay over the upper<br>
surface of the user's leg, a corresponding opposite end of each strap assembly<br>
being movable by the user whereby pulling each corresponding opposite end<br>
creates a corresponding downward force on the upper surface of the user's leg.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide an improved knee<br>
extension treatment apparatus.<br>
Related objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent<br>
from the following description.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the<br>
invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the<br>
drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will<br>
nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is<br>
thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated<br>
device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as<br>
illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in<br>
the art to which the invention relates.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is illustrated a knee extension treatment<br>
apparatus 20 that is constructed and arranged according to the present invention.<br>
In the FIG. 1 illustration, the treatment apparatus 20 is opened or unfolded into<br>
what would be considered its ready-for-use condition. In this condition, it is ready<br>
for use by the individual that may either be a patient recovering from knee surgery,<br>
or a would-be patient contemplating knee surgery, or any other individual where<br>
some type of treatment for the knee has been recommended or suggested. The<br>
patient or would-be patient is the user of apparatus 20 and thus the terms "patient"<br>
and "user" or even "patient-user" can be used interchangeably.<br>
The exploded view of FIG. 2 may be preferred in terms of explaining and<br>
describing a majority of the component parts that are required for treatment<br>
apparatus 20 and the cooperating assembly of those component parts. Once there<br>
is a thorough understanding of each component part of treatment apparatus 20 and<br>
how those parts are assembled to one another, it will be easy to understand what<br>
occurs when changing from the FIG. 1 orientation or arrangement into the folded<br>
orientation of FIG. 4 and then back to the FIG. 1 extended or opened arrangement.<br>
With continued reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, it should be noted that the leg<br>
slipcover 28 and seat cushion 29 of FIG. 1 are omitted from the FIG. 2 illustration,<br>
simply for drawing clarity and to preclude other parts from being hidden from<br>
view. Treatment apparatus 20 includes a frame assembly 21, ankle support 22,<br>
first strap assembly 23, second strap assembly 24, cable system 25, and manually-<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
7<br>
adjusted ratcheted pulley 26 with a torque lever 27. Leg slipcover 28 is secured to<br>
frame assembly 21 and seat cushion 29 is secured to seat 32.<br>
The frame assembly 21 includes a left-side tubular rail 30, a right-side<br>
tubular rail 31, seat 32, and T-section 33. The T-section 33 fits between the distal<br>
ends 30a and 31a of the left-side and right-side rails 30 and 31, respectively. The<br>
lower tube 34 of seat 32 extends between proximal ends 30b and 31b of the tubular<br>
rails 30 and 31, respectively.<br>
Hollow tube 37 extends between rail 30 and rail 31 and functions as a brace<br>
for added strength and rigidity to frame assembly 21. A second brace is provided<br>
by hollow tube 38. Rod 39 is threaded at each end and is of a length sufficient to<br>
extend through tube 38 and at one end beyond the outer surface of rail 30 and at<br>
the other (opposite) end beyond the outer surface of rail 31. Each threaded end<br>
receives a flat washer 40a and an acorn hex nut 40b for securely tightening the rod<br>
39 and tube 38 assembly to and into the two tubular rails 30 and 31.<br>
Rod 41 is threaded at each end and is similar in construction and purpose to<br>
rod 39, except the rod 41 is longer than rod 39 and extends through tube 37. Hat<br>
washers 40a and acorn hex nuts 40b are used for securely tightening this rod and<br>
tube assembly to the two tubular rails 30 and 31. Rod 42 is threaded at each end<br>
and is constructed and arranged to extend through lower tube 34 and beyond the<br>
outer surfaces of each tubular rail 30 and 31. Flat washers 40a and acorn nuts 40b<br>
are used for securing the seat 32 to the tubular rails 30 and 31. Shouldered<br>
bushings 43 are used to facilitate the folding forward of the seat 32 relative to the<br>
remainder of the apparatus as will be described hereinafter.<br>
The first strap assembly 23 is constructed and arranged similar to an<br>
automobile seat belt, including a primary strap portion 45 and a securing buckle<br>
46. Buckle 46 is secured to tubular rail 30 by means of the flexible belt length 47<br>
that includes a clearance hole 48 for receipt of rod 39. Strap portion 45 includes a<br>
belt length 49 that is threaded through tongue member 50. Belt length 49 provides<br>
for strap extension if added or increased length is needed. Attached end 52<br>
includes a D-ring 53 and belt length 45 is sewn to itself after threading through D-<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
8<br>
ring 53. Cable 54 is used to securely connect to first strap assembly 23 using D-<br>
ring 53. The tip 55 of tongue member 50 is constructed and arranged to be<br>
inserted into buckle 46 by way of slot 56. The receipt of tip 55 by buckle 46<br>
creates a secure connection that is easily releasable by manually lifting up on<br>
release lever 57.<br>
The second strap assembly 24 has a construction that is virtually identical<br>
to first strap assembly 23, including the primary strap portion 45a and a securing<br>
buckle 46a. The reference numeral suffix of "a" is being used to designate like<br>
component parts of second strap assembly 24 that correspond to first strap<br>
assembly 23. Some of these primary component parts include belt length 49a,<br>
tongue member 50a, and D-ring 53a. Cable 61 is used to securely connect to<br>
second strap assembly 24 using D-ring 53a. Cables 54 and 61 are each wound<br>
around a cooperating roller 62 that is positioned inside of the hollow tubular rail<br>
31. Rod 39 extends through the outer wall of rail 31 and then through roller 62.<br>
Rod 41 extends through the outer wall of rail 31 at an adjustable location closer to<br>
seat 32 and then through its corresponding roller 62. This location is made<br>
adjustable by providing four sets of spaced apart (through) clearance holes 63, four<br>
sets on each side of apparatus 20, defined as through-holes by rails 30 and 31.<br>
Cables 54 and 61 are securely joined to main cable 64 that extends out of<br>
proximal end 31b of rail 31 such that pulling on main cable 64, as if to pull it out<br>
of end 31b, causes cable 54 and 61 to concurrently and uniformly pull on D-rings<br>
53 and 53a, respectively. The connection of cables 54 and 61 to main cable 64 is<br>
performed in a way so as to equalize or balance the pulling force so that the<br>
tensioning of the first and second strap assemblies 23 and 24 is substantially equal<br>
in response to the single pulling force on main cable 64. End cap 65 closes<br>
proximal end 30b of rail 30 while end cap 66 is shaped with a central opening for<br>
clearance with cable 64.<br>
The proximal end 64a of cable 64 is arranged with a tongue member 68 for<br>
receipt by buckle 70 that is received by the ratcheted pulley 26 via pulley strap 69.<br>
The connection of tongue member 68 to cable 64 is facilitated by creating a loop<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
9<br>
71 in the end 64a of cable 64 for connection to tongue member 68. The pulley<br>
strap 69 is secured to the pulley 26 such that, as knob 72 is turned, the strap is<br>
wound up (i.e., shortened). As the strap is wound up, the tension pulling on the<br>
first and second strap assemblies 23 and 24 tightens these assemblies and, as will<br>
be described, creates downward forces, one proximal to the knee and the other<br>
distal to the knee. This arrangement of the two strap assemblies 23 and 24 relative<br>
to the leg of the user is illustrated in FIG. 3. Similar to what has been described as<br>
part of the parent application, that application being incorporated by reference<br>
herein, the substantially horizontal force pulling on cable 64 in a direction that is<br>
substantially parallel to the frame assembly and seat, in the FIG. 1 orientation, is<br>
translated into downward forces, one downward force being proximal to the knee<br>
and the other being distal to the knee. Both forces are directed toward the frame<br>
assembly and are substantially normal to the frame.<br>
When utilizing apparatus 20 for knee treatment, it is assumed that the leg of<br>
the user will be bent at the knee as the user rests in a recumbent position on seat 32<br>
with the ankle supported in an elevated position by ankle support 22. The<br>
treatment process includes applying a knee-proximal downward force and a knee-<br>
distal downward force against the upper surface of the leg in an attempt to<br>
straighten the leg by taking out the bend at the knee. This process involves<br>
stretching of the muscles that affect the knee joint and requires being able to apply<br>
enough force for the required stretching and then maintaining that force level<br>
during the stretching process. This procedure also requires that as the leg begins to<br>
straighten, any slack that might be available in terms of the cable/strap<br>
arrangement can be taken up (i.e., tightened), such that the overall length of that<br>
cable/strap arrangement is shortened by winding up some portion of strap 69 onto<br>
the ratcheted pulley 26.<br>
As the cable/strap network is tightened, there is a need to maintain the<br>
force level so as to continue the stretching process. The ratcheted pulley 26<br>
performs this desired (unidirectional) function, a capability inherent in its<br>
construction and inherent from the definition of "ratcheted". The finite<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
10<br>
adjustments that are available depend on the ratchet tooth size and spacing. What<br>
occurs is that, as the slack in the cable/strap arrangement is coiled onto the<br>
ratcheted pulley, the ratcheted arrangement allows the pulley to notch into the next<br>
tooth location and the unidirectional construction for the ratcheted pulley holds<br>
that position. A simple release latch is all that is required to release the ratcheted<br>
pulley, allowing the pulley to freely rotate in either direction. The use of the<br>
ratcheted pulley allows the user to maintain the desired force level by using a<br>
simple mechanical device and enables the user to readily increase the force level,<br>
as required, by simply winding up any cable/strap slack onto pulley 26.<br>
As the forces on the leg need to be increased, as part of the treatment of the<br>
knee and the overall treatment procedure, there will be the need to shorten strap 69<br>
by the continued turning of knob 72. If the necessary or desired torque on knob 72<br>
is not able to be easily effected manually, the available removable torque lever 27<br>
can be fitted over knob 72 and used for its mechanical advantage. The increased<br>
moment arm makes it easier to turn knob 72 when a higher force level on the leg is<br>
desired. The outer peripheral surface of knob 72 is contoured with an alternating<br>
series of raised ribs and recesses. The interior of the cylindrical hub 27a of lever<br>
27 is compatibly contoured with a reverse series of raised ribs and recesses. In this<br>
way, the hub 27a fits securely over knob 72 so as to increase the moment arm for<br>
easier turning of the ratcheted pulley 26. The lever 27 is removed from the knob<br>
for transport and/or storage of apparatus 20.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, leg slipcover 28 includes a fabric or nylon<br>
webbing panel 77 that includes three width-wise securing straps 78a-78c that are<br>
sewn to panel 77 at the three spaced-apart locations as illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
Additionally, there are four end strap lengths 78d-78g also sewn to panel 77, two<br>
strap lengths at each end. Each strap 78a-78c includes a free end strap length at<br>
each end and a VELCROÂ® combination that is used to secure each free end strap<br>
length to itself. Each strap length 78d-78g also includes a VELCROÂ® combination<br>
such that each strap length can be wound around a portion of frame assembly 21,<br>
as illustrated, and then secured to itself. Strap lengths 78d and 78e are each<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
11<br>
wrapped around lower tube 34 so as to help secure the leg slipcover 28 to frame<br>
assembly 21. Strap length 78f is wrapped around the tubular joint where T-section<br>
33 inserts into distal end 30a. Strap length 78g is wrapped around the tubular joint<br>
where T-section 33 inserts into distal end 31a.<br>
Seat cushion 29 is constructed and arranged into two connected pad<br>
portions 29a and 29b. Pad portion 29a is connected to seat frame 80 by the use of<br>
six strap lengths 79a-79f. Each of these strap lengths includes a VELCOÂ®<br>
combination such that each strap length 79a-79f can be wound around seat frame<br>
80 and secured to itself.<br>
Portion 29b is joined to portion 29a by flexible web 81. Depending on the<br>
desired seat cushion thickness for a particular user, portion 29b can be flipped over<br>
onto portion 29a for added thickness, or left as illustrated in FIG. 1 for less seat<br>
cushion thickness.<br>
The structural configuration of treatment apparatus 20 includes a number of<br>
adjustments that are included in order to try and customize, at least to some extent,<br>
the treatment apparatus 20 to "fit" the end user who will be, for example, an<br>
â€¢ individual trying to work with the knee in order to avoid knee surgery or an<br>
individual providing treatment to the leg/knee following a surgical procedure, or<br>
perhaps building up the knee prior to contemplated surgery.<br>
The first two adjustments relate to ankle support 22 and its orientation<br>
relative to the remainder of treatment apparatus 20. Included as cooperative<br>
component parts for these two adjustments are T-section 33, distal ends 30a and<br>
31a, and push pins 84 (handled). T-section 33 includes first and second reduced<br>
diameter portions 33a and 33b that insert into distal ends 30a and 31a, respectively.<br>
The first reduced diameter portion 33a includes a receiving hole 85 for one push<br>
pin 84. Distal end 30a includes a plurality of clearance holes 86 allowing T-<br>
section 33 to be rotated relative to the distal ends in order to change the angle of<br>
incline or tilt of the vertical axis 87 (see line 87) extending lengthwise through<br>
ankle support 22. When push pin 84 is removed, the ankle support 22 is<br>
collapsible by pivoting downwardly toward seat 32 for transport and/or storage.<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
12<br>
The spacing and the number of holes 86 determines the number of different<br>
settings and the amount or extent of incline in terms of the orientation of axis line<br>
87. It will be noted that the location and number of holes 86 can be either<br>
clockwise or counterclockwise from vertical such that the ankle support 22 can be<br>
tilted off of true vertical toward the seat or tilted off of true vertical away from the<br>
seat. In terms of use of the ankle support 22 and its adjustment, once hole 85 is<br>
aligned with the selected one of the plurality of holes 86 for the desired angle of<br>
incline, push pin 84, which includes a handle-like head, is inserted through hole 86<br>
and into hole 85 in order to fix the relationship between T-section 33 and the left-<br>
side and right-side tubular rails 30 and 31, respectively. In order to change the<br>
angle of incline, which of course could include a true vertical orientation, the user<br>
simply pulls out the push pin 84, selects another hole 86, and then aligns hole 85<br>
with the selected hole 86, and reinserts the push pin 84.<br>
The second adjustment involves the height of ankle support 22 relative to<br>
the remainder of the frame 21 and importantly relative to the surface of seat 32 that<br>
is supporting the user. Ankle support 22 includes a reduced diameter portion 22a<br>
that inserts into tubular sleeve 89 of T-section 33. Portion 22a includes a plurality<br>
of clearance holes 90 and sleeve 89 includes a cooperating clearance hole 91. Push<br>
pin 84 is used to pin together portion 22a and sleeve 89 once the ankle support 22<br>
is set at the desired height. The number and spacing of holes 90 determines the<br>
number of different height settings that are possible for ankle support 22. The<br>
different height settings are directed to the location of support surface 92 of ankle<br>
support 22 relative to frame assembly 21 and ultimately relative to the support<br>
surface 93 of seat 32. While support surface 93 is selected in FIG. 2 as the upper<br>
surface of support plate 96, the support surface 93 becomes the upper surface of<br>
cushion 29 if the cushion is used. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the desire is to try and<br>
position the ankle support surface 92 at a location or height above that surface<br>
where the user is "seated" (i.e., in a recumbent position) so as to take into<br>
consideration the anatomy of the user and the appropriate elevation of the leg for<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
13<br>
the selected treatment procedure. This particular adjustment enables the user of<br>
treatment apparatus 20 to configure that apparatus to better fit his or her anatomy.<br>
Another point of adjustment is provided by the left-side and right-side<br>
tubular rails 30 and 31, respectively, relative to the location of second strap<br>
assembly 24. This in turn determines where the primary strap portion 45a will be<br>
positioned relative to the leg of the user, and more specifically where it will be<br>
positioned relative to the knee of the user.<br>
Each tubular rail 30 and 31 includes a series of four spaced-apart clearance<br>
holes 63 that are aligned so as to receive threaded rod 41 that is inserted through<br>
hollow tube 37. As previously described, the second strap assembly 24 is<br>
assembled to frame assembly 21 by this rod and sleeve combination, including<br>
wing nuts 40b. Accordingly, the selection of a particular clearance hole in each<br>
tubular rail 30, 31 determines where the primary strap portion 45a will be located<br>
relative to seat 32, ankle support 22, and the first strap assembly 23.<br>
A further point of adjustment is provided by the point of connection of the<br>
ratcheted pulley 26 relative to the support plate 96 that cooperates with frame 80 to<br>
form seat 32, without pad portions 29a and 29b. Plate 96 includes a series of four<br>
spaced-apart clearance holes 97 for the attachment of mounting plate 98. Bolts 99<br>
and wing nuts 100 complete the assembly. Mounting plate 98 includes a shoulder<br>
bolt 101 for the attachment of the ratcheted pulley (and buckle) assembly 26.<br>
Depending on the size of the user, and the positioning of the user's torso and right<br>
arm relative to the ratcheted pulley 26 location, there are three different positions<br>
that are available for the attachment of mounting plate 98 onto plate 96. More<br>
adjustment positions can be made available by increasing the number of clearance<br>
holes 97.<br>
A further feature of the present invention that is enabled by its specific<br>
construction is the ability to fold the seat 32 forwardly and downwardly in the<br>
direction of the tubular rails 30 and 31, see FIG. 4. A related feature is the ability<br>
to fold the ankle support 22 and T-section 33 rearwardly and downwardly in the<br>
direction of the tubular rails 30 and 31, also illustrated in FIG. 4.<br><br>
WO 2006/118781	PCT/US2006/014487<br>
14<br>
Folding of the seat 32 is enabled by the rod 42 and lower tube 34 assembly<br>
and the use of bushings 43. Since the seat is intended to be placed flat on the<br>
support surface used for treatment apparatus 20, this point of connection by way of<br>
rod 42 does not have to be fixed or secured in terms of pivoting or hinging, but<br>
rather should be hinged or pivotable for the forward folding of the seat.<br>
Once treatment apparatus 20 is placed into the folded condition of FIG. 4,<br>
the first and second strap assemblies 23 and 24, respectively, are used to secure the<br>
seat in the illustrated folded condition. The ankle support 22 and T-section 33 are<br>
actually folded rearwardly first so that the seat 32, once folded, can be used to<br>
secure and actually clamp down onto the ankle support 22, as is illustrated in FIG.<br>
4. When the two strap assemblies 23 and 24 are buckled around the back of the<br>
folded seat, treatment apparatus 20 is configured into a transport and/or storage<br>
arrangement. The lightweight and portable nature of treatment apparatus 20<br>
creates a uniquely attractive treatment apparatus as compared to those larger, more<br>
bulky and cumbersome designs that do not have any aspect of portability. For the<br>
present invention, lightweight materials have been used in terms of the nylon<br>
webbing and straps, hollow tubular frame members, and a minimum of component<br>
parts all provide to the lightweight and portable nature of treatment apparatus 20.<br>
The simple construction and ease of assembly and disassembly of the various<br>
component parts also enables any required repairs to be made easily by the user<br>
without having to discard perfectly good component parts because they are welded<br>
together or fixed in some fashion that they must be discarded with the damaged<br>
part.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the<br>
drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and<br>
not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment<br>
has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come<br>
within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.<br><br>
