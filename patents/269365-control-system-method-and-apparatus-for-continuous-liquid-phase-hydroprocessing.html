				<td>CONTROL SYSTEM METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTINUOUS LIQUID<br>
PHASE HYDROPROCESSING<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process, apparatus, and method of control for a hydroprocessing process where the reactants are held predominately in the liquid state and it is no longer necessary to circulate hydrogen throughout the catalyst. Relevant prior art may be found in U.S. Class 208, subclasses 58,59, 60,79, 209, and 213. Additional relevant art maybe found in U.S. Class 137, subclasses 171,202, and 392, as well as other classes and subclasses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a continuous liquid phase hydroprocessing process, apparatus and process control systems, wherein the need to circulate hydrogen gas through the catalyst is eliminated. This is accomplished by mixing and/or flashing the hydrogen and the oil to be treated hi the presence of a solvent or diluent in which the hydrogen solubility is high relative to the oil feed. The present invention is also directed to hydro-cracking, hydroisomerization and hydrodemetalization.<br>
hi hydroprocessing, which includes hydrotreating, hydrofinishing, hydrorefining and hydrocracking, a catalyst is used for reacting hydrogen with a petroleum fraction, distillates, resids, or other chemicals, for the purpose of saturating or removing sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, metals or other contaminants, or for molecular weight reduction (cracking). Catalysts having special surface properties are required in order to provide the necessary activity to accomplish the desired reaction(s).<br>
In conventional hydroprocessing it is necessary to transfer hydrogen from a vapor phase into the liquid phase where it will be available to react with a petroleum molecule at the surface of the catalyst. This is accomplished by circulating very large volumes of hydrogen gas and the oil through a catalyst bed. The oil and the hydrogen flow through the bed and the hydrogen is absorbed into a thin film of oil that is distributed over the catalyst. Because the amount of hydrogen required can be large, 1000 to 5000 SCF/bbl of liquid, the reactors are very large and can operate at severe conditions, from a few hundred psi to as much as 5000 psi, and temperatures from around 400°F-900°F.<br>
The temperature inside the reactor is difficult to control in conventional systems. The temperature of the oil and hydrogen feed in the reactor can be controlled; however, once the<br><br>
feed is inside the reactor, there no adjustments to the system that can raise or lower the temperature of the oil/hydrogen mixture. Any changes in the reactor temperature must be accomplished through an outside source. As a result, conventional systems often inject cold hydrogen into the reactor if it becomes too hot. This method of cooling a reactor is expensive and is a potential safety risk.<br>
While controlling the temperature of the reactor is often a difficult task in conventional systems, controlling the pressure of the hydroprocessing system is a much easier task. Pressure control systems are used to monitor the pressure of the system, release pressure through a valve if the pressure becomes too great, and to increase the pressure of the system if the pressure becomes too low. A pressure control system cannot be used to control the pressure on a single hydroprocessing reactor; however, this is of no serious consequence and instead pressure is maintained on the entire system, not on individual reactors.<br>
One of the biggest problems with hydroprocessing is catalyst coking. Coking occurs when hydrocarbon molecules become too hot in an environment where the amount of hydrogen available is insufficient. The molecule cracks to the point that it forms coke, a carbonaceous residue. Cracking can take place on the surface of the catalyst, leading to coke formation and deactivation of the catalyst.<br>
A conventional system for processing is shown in U.S. Patent Number 4,698,147, issued to McConaghy, Jr. on October 6, 1987, which discloses a SHORT RESIDENCE TIME HYDROGEN DONOR DILUENT CRACKING PROCESS. McConaghy '147 mixes the input flow with a donor diluent to supply the hydrogen for the cracking process. After the cracking process, the mixture is separated into product and spent diluent, and the spent diluent is regenerated by partial hydrogenation and returned to the input flow for the cracking step. Note that McConaghy '147 substantially changes the chemical nature of the donor diluent during the process in order to release the hydrogen necessary for cracking. Also, the McConaghy '147 process is limited by upper temperature restraints due to coil coking, and increased light gas production, which sets an economically imposed limit on the maximum cracking temperature of the process.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,857,168, issued to Kubo et al. on August 15,1989, discloses a METHOD FOR HYDROCRACKING HEAVY FRACTION OIL. Kubo '168 uses both a donor diluent and hydrogen gas to supply the hydrogen for the catalyst enhanced cracking process. Kubo '168 discloses that a proper supply of heavy fraction oil, donor solvent, hydrogen gas, and catalyst will limit the formation of coke on the catalyst, and the coke formation may be substantially or completely eliminated. Kubo '168 requires a cracking<br><br>
reactor with catalyst and a separate hydrogenating reactor with catalyst. Kubo '168 also relies on the breakdown of the donor diluent for supply hydrogen in the reaction process.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,164,074, issued to Houghton on November 17,1992, shows a HYDRODESULFURIZATION PRESSURE CONTROL apparatus for controlling pressure in a combination hydrodesulfurization and reforming process wherein the pressure of a hydrogen-rich gas source from the reforming process is adjusted by coordinately manipulating a vent control valve for the reforming process in a manner that insures maximum utilization of available hydrogen for desulfurization before any of the hydrogen from the reforming process is vented through its own vent valve.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,761,513, issued to Steacy on August 2, 1988, shows a TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR AROMATIC ALKYLATION PROCESS. The temperature control is a quench system that uses a methylating agent as a quench medium that is introduced between sequential reaction zones in a reactor. The proportion of vapor phase and liquid phase methanol is adjusted to control the enthalpy of the methylating agent and provide temperature reduction by the vaporization of the liquid component of the methylating agent.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a process has been developed wherein the need to circulate hydrogen gas through the catalyst is eliminated. This is accomplished by mixing and/or flashing the hydrogen and the oil to be treated in the presence of a solvent or diluent in which the hydrogen solubility is "high" relative to the oil feed, in a constant pressure environment, so that the hydrogen is in solution.<br>
The type and amount of diluent added, as well as the reactor conditions can be set so that all of the hydrogen required in the hydroprocessing reactions is available in solution. The oil/diluent/hydrogen solution can then be fed to a reactor, such as a plug flow or tubular reactor, packed with catalyst where the oil and hydrogen react.  No additional hydrogen is required, therefore, the hydrogen recirculation is avoided and the trickle bed operation of the reactor is avoided. Therefore, the large trickle bed reactors can be replaced by much smaller reactors (see FIGS. 1, 2 and 3). The continuous liquid phase reactors provide more control over the reactor temperature, virtually eliminate catalyst coldng, reduce light end hydrocarbon production and can make the system safer.<br>

together with the feedstock and a diluent, such as recycled hydrocracked product, isomerized product, or recycled demetaled product, so as to place hydrogen in solution, and then the mixture is passed over a catalyst.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
We have developed a process where the need to circulate hydrogen gas or have a separate hydrogen phase through the catalyst is eliminated.  This is accomplished by mixing and/or flashing the hydrogen and the oil to be treated in the presence of a solvent or diluent having a relatively high solubility for hydrogen, in a constant pressure environment, so that the hydrogen hi is solution. Excess hydrogen is mixed and/or flashed into the oil/diluent solution so that the maximum capacity of the oil/diluent solution for hydrogen is utilized. Hydrogen in excess of the amount soluble in the oil/diluent solution remains in the vapor phase.<br>
The type and amount of diluent added, as well as the reactor conditions, can be set so that all of the hydrogen required in the hydroprocessing reaction is available in solution. The oil/diluent/hydrogen solution can then be fed to a plug flow, tubular or other reactor packed with catalyst where the oil and hydrogen react. No additional hydrogen is required, therefore, hydrogen recirculation is avoided and the trickle bed operation of the reactor is avoided (see FIGS. 1,2 and 3). Hence, the large trickle bed reactors can be replaced by much smaller or simpler reactors (see FIG. 18).<br>
In addition to using much smaller or simpler reactors, the use of a hydrogen recycle compressor is avoided. Because all of the hydrogen required for the reaction may be available in solution ahead of the reactor, there is no need to circulate hydrogen gas within the reactor and no need for the recycle compressor. Elimination of the recycle compressor and the use of, for example plug flow or tubular reactors, greatly reduces the capital cost of the hydrotreating process.<br>
The reactors in the present invention may be altered in design and in number to accommodate the specifications required of the product, given a specific feed. To achieve the desired product specifications from a particularly contaminated feed may necessitate the addition of an additional reactor. Even in the case where multiple reactors are required, the<br><br>
reactors of the present invention are preferred to conventional reactors because their smaller size and more simple design still results in a reduction of capital cost when compared to conventional systems. In addition to utilizing multiple reactors, it is also possible to house multiple catalyst beds within a single reactor housing. The creation of multiple-bed reactors (see FIG. 19) further lowers capital cost by utilizing a single reactor vessel to house multiple catalyst beds. The catalyst beds may contain the same catalyst type, or they may contain different catalyst types to more efficiently accomplish the product specification goal.<br>
Most of the reactions that take place in hydroprocessing are highly exothermic, and as a result, a great deal of heat is generated in the reactor. The temperature of the reactor can be controlled by using a recycle stream. A controlled volume of reactor effluent can be recycled back to the front of the reactor, using a reheater as necessary, and blended with fresh feed and hydrogen. The recycle stream absorbs heat created by the reaction of the feed and hydrogen on the catalyst and reduces the temperature rise through the reactor. The reactor temperature can be controlled by controlling the fresh feed temperature, using a preheater as necessary, and the amount of recycle. In addition, because the recycle stream contains molecules that have already reacted, it also serves as an inert diluent. The present invention provides further control of the temperature of the reactor through the use of a continuous liquid phase reactor, as opposed to the conventional trickle bed reactors where only a thin film of liquid is distributed over the catalyst. The advantage of a continuous liquid phase reactor is that liquids, in general, have higher heat capacities than gases. The greater the heat capacity of a given molecule, the greater ability that molecule has for absorbing heat from its surroundings while undergoing a minimal increase in temperature itself. A continuous liquid phase reactor acts as a heat sink, absorbing excess heat from the reactor to equalize the temperature throughout. With the introduction of the continuous liquid phase reactor, the process becomes much closer to being isothermal, reducing a typical 40°F-60°F (22°C-33°C) temperature difference between the reactor inlet and reactor outlet to approximately a 10°F (5.5°C) temperature difference. In addition to reducing the temperature difference between the reactor inlet and reactor outlet temperatures, the continuous liquid phase reactor also serves to greatly reduce the problem of hot spots developing within the catalyst bed.<br>
Using the present invention for hydroprocessing, coking can be nearly eliminated because there is always enough hydrogen available in solution to avoid coking when cracking reactions take place. This can lead to much longer catalyst life and reduced operating and maintenance costs.<br><br>
Another problem found in hydroprocessing is the production of light end hydrocarbon gases. These molecules, predominately methane, are an undesirable  which, in great enough quantities, must be recovered, at additional cost. These light ends increase in quantity as the temperature of the reaction goes up. The problem of light end production is further compounded by the tendency for a reactor to develop hot spots, areas where the temperature increases significantly above the set temperature for the reactor. To combat this occurrence, conventional hydroprocessing systems employ the use of quench boxes which are placed throughout the reactor. The quench boxes serve to inject cold hydrogen into the reactor to reduce the temperature inside the reactor. Not only is hydrogen an expensive choice for cooling the reactor, it can pose a safety hazard. The design of the quench boxes and the method of controlling how they introduce hydrogen into the reactor are vital, because an error could cause the loss of control of the entire system. A runaway reaction could be started, possibly creating an explosion. Using the present invention for hydroprocessing, cracking is greatly reduced, often by a 10-fold reduction, through the use of a continuous liquid phase reactor working also as a heat sink to create a reactor environment that is close to isothermal. This near isothermal environment eliminates the need for cold hydrogen quench boxes, reduces the capital cost of hydrogen required for the process and increases the safety of the system.<br>
With the introduction of a continuous liquid phase reactor, there is a need to be able to control the temperature of the liquid in the reactor and thus, the heat sink which allows the system to remain close to isothermal. By controlling the amount of recycle fluid and the temperature of the fresh feed, it is possible to control the temperature of the liquid in the reactor, and maintain the heat sink, without the need for hydrogen quench boxes.<br>
Another issue that arises with the introduction of a continuous liquid phase reactor is the need for a process for controlling the quantity of that liquid. This is accomplished by one of two ways. First, the quantity of liquid in the reactor can be controlled by maintaining the liquid in the reactor to a specified level (See FIGS. 6, 8,10,12,14 and 16). In this process, there is a specified liquid level range within the reactor which must be maintained. If the level of the liquid rises too high, the amount of hydrogen in the oil/diluent/hydrogen mixture going into reactor will be increased to lower the liquid level. If the level of the liquid drops too low, the amount of hydrogen in the oil/diluent/hydrogen mixture going into the reactor will be decreased to allow more liquid to enter the reactor. In the second control process, the quantity of liquid in the reactor can. be controlled by maintaining the pressure of the gases inside the reactor (See FIGS. 7, 9,11,13,15 and 17). The excess hydrogen and light end<br><br>
hydrocarbon gases inside the reactor are held to a specified pressure. If the pressure of those gases becomes too great, the amount of hydrogen in the oil/diluent/hydrogen mixture introduced into the reactor will be decreased to achieve optimal pressure. If the pressure drops too low, the amount of hydrogen in the oil/diluent/hydrogen mixture will be increased. In a hydroprocessing system where multiple reactors or multiple bed reactors are used, the quantity of liquid in the reactors or, in the case of a multiple bed reactor, surrounding the catalyst beds, can be controlled by the exclusive utilization of either multiple liquid level controls or multiple vapor pressure controls of the gases in the upper portion of the reactor, or the two control methods may be combined, in various combinations, within the same system.<br>
The present invention also differs from conventional technology in that excess gas can be vented directly from the reactor. In conventional hydrotreating, the venting of gases directly from the reactor is not possible because hydrogen gas must be circulated through the reactor. If gas were to be vented directly from conventional reactors, a great deal of hydrogen would be lost or used inefficiently. Because the present invention utilizes a continuous liquid phase reactor, it is not necessary to circulate hydrogen through the reactor, and therefore, the only gases inside the reactor are excess hydrogen and light end hydrocarbon gases. Venting excess gas directly from the reactor allows more efficient control of the system by minimizing the time needed for the system to adjust after changes are made to the vent gas flow rate or the addition of hydrogen to or subtraction of hydrogen from the system.<br>

Fresh feed stock 202 is combined with a first diluent 204 at a first combination area 206 to form first diluent-feed 208. First diluent-feed 208 is then combined with a second diluent 210 at second combination area 212 to form second diluent-feed 214. Second diluent-feed 214 is then pumped by diluent-feed charge pump 216 to third combination area 218.<br>

Second diluent-feed 214 and compressed hydrogen 224 are combined at third combination area 218 to form hydrogen-diluent-feed mixture 226. The hydrogen-diluent-feed mixture 226 then flows through feed-product exchanger 228 which warms the mixture 226, by use of the third separator exhaust 230, to form the first exchanger flow 232. First exchanger flow 232 and first recycle flow 234 are combined at fourth combination area 236 to form first recycle feed 238.<br><br>
The first recycle feed 238 then flows through first feed-product exchanger 240 which warms the mixture 238, by use of the exchanged first rectifier exchanged exhaust 242, to form the second exchanger flow 244. Second exchanger flow 244 and second recycle flow 246 are combined at fifth combination area 248 to form second recycle feed 250.<br>
The second recycle feed 250 is then mixed in feed-recycle mixer 252 to form feed-recycle mixture 254. Feed-recycle mixture 254 then flows into reactor inlet separator 256.<br>
Feed-recycle mixture 254 is separated in reactor inlet separator 256 to form reactor inlet separator waste gases 258 and inlet separated mixture 260. The reactor inlet separator waste gases 258 are flared or otherwise removed from the present system 200.<br>

As first catalyst bed product/hydrogen 3482 reacts, second catalyst bed hydrogen gas and light end hydrocarbon gases 3505 may come out of solution and accumulate at the top of second catalyst bed 3520. Second catalyst bed gases 3505 are removed through second reactor orifice 3507. The rate at which second catalyst bed gases 3505 are removed from through second reactor orifice 3507 is controlled by second vent valve 3530.<br>
The pressure of excess second catalyst bed hydrogen and light end hydrocarbon gases, 3505, are monitored at second pressure controller 3510 which is above second catalyst bed 3520. If the pressure of second catalyst bed gases 3505 rises above the desired gas pressure, second pressure controller 3510 will signal to second hydrogen valve 3490 to decrease the amount of hydrogen to second mixer 3480. If the pressure of second catalyst bed gases 3505 drops below the desired gas pressure, second pressure controller 3510 will signal to second hydrogen valve 3490 to increase the amount of hydrogen into second mixer 3480.<br><br>
Reacted product 3506 exits reactor 3440 through reactor outlet 3444.

Generally, Fischer-Tropsch refers to the production of paraffins from carbon monoxide and hydrogen (CO and H2 or synthesis gas). Synthesis gas contains CO2, CO, Ha and is produced from various sources, primarily coal or natural gas. The synthesis gas is then reacted over specific catalysts to produce specific products.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is the production of hydrocarbons, almost exclusively paraffins, from CO and Ha over a supported metal catalyst. The classic Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is iron; however other metal catalysts are also used.<br>
Synthesis gas can and is used to produce other chemicals as well, primarily alcohols, although these are not Fischer-Tropsch reactions. The technology of the present invention can be used for any catalytic process where one or more components must be transferred from the gas phase to the liquid phase for reaction on the catalyst surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>

EXAMPLE 20<br>
The process as recited in at least one of the examples above, wherein in addition to hydrogen, carbon monoxide (CO) is mixed with the hydrogen and the mixture is contacted with a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst for the synthesis of hydrocarbon chemicals.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
The process as recited in at least one of the examples above, wherein the quantity of the liquid feed/diluent/hydrogen mixture inside the reactor is controlled by the level of the liquid feed/diluent/hydrogen mixture and reacted liquid feed/diluent/hydrogen mixture in the reactor.<br>
The level of the liquids in the reactor is held above the top of the catalyst bed in the reactor and monitored by a level controller. As the level of the liqxiids in the reactor rises or falls, the amount of hydrogen added to the feed/diluent mixture is adjusted to lower or raise, respectively, the level of the liquids in the reactor.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
The process as recited in at least one of the examples above, wherein the quantity of the liquid feed/diluent/hydrogen mixture inside the reactor is controlled by the pressure of the excess hydrogen gas and light end hydrocarbon gases at the top of the reactor.<br>
The pressure of the gases at the top of the reactor is held to a specified pressure appropriate for the particular application, with respect to the feed and the desired product specifications. As the pressure of the gases at the top of the reactor increases or decreases, the amount of hydrogen added to the feed/diluent mixture is adjusted to decrease or increase, respectively, the pressure of the gases at the top of the reactor.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an improved hydroprocessing, hydrotreating, hydrofmishing, hydrorefming, and/or hydrocracking process provides for the removal of impurities from lube oils and waxes at a relatively low pressure and with a minimum amount of catalyst by reducing or eliminating the need to force hydrogen into solution by pressure in the reactor vessel and by increasing the solubility for hydrogen by adding a diluent or a solvent or choice of diluent or solvent. For example, a diluent for a<br><br>
heavy cut is diesel fuel and a diluent for a light cut is pentane. Moreover, while using pentane as a diluent, one can achieve high solubility. Further, using the process of the present invention, one can achieve more than a stoichiometric requirement of hydrogen in solution. Also, by utilizing the process of the present invention, one can reduce cost of the pressure vessel and can use catalyst in small tubes in the reactor and thereby reduce cost. Further, by utilizing the process of the present invention, one may be able to eliminate the need for a hydrogen recycle compressor.<br>
Although the process of the present invention can be utilized in conventional equipment for hydroprocessing, hydrotreatiug, hydrofinishing, hydrorefining and/or hydrocracking, one can achieve the same or a better result using lower cost equipment, reactors, hydrogen compressors, and the like by being able to run the process at a lower pressure, and/or recycling solvent, diluent, hydrogen, or at least a portion of the previously hydroprocessed stock or feed.<br>

Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
