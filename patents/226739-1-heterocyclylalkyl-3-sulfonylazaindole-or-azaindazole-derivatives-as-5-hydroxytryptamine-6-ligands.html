1-HETER0CYCLYLALKYL-3-SULFONYLAZAINDOLE OR -AZAINDAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAM1NE-6 LIGANDS<br><br><br>
This invention relates to 1-heterocyc!ylalkyl-3-sulfonyIazaindole or -azaindazole derivatives useful as 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 ligands, to processes for their preparation, methods of treatment using them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine)(5-HT) receptors play a critical role in many physiological and behavioural functions in humans and animals. These functions are mediated through various 5-HT receptors distributed throughout the body. There are now approximately fifteen different human 5-HT receptor subtypes that have been cloned, many with well-defined roles in humans. One of the most recently identified 5-HT receptor subtypes is the 5-HT6 receptor, first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W. Molecular Pharmacology 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R. Journal of Neurochemistry 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Trarffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L; Diaz, L; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C. Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human. In situ hybridization studies of the 5-HT6 receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M. Neuroscience 1995, 64,1105-1111).<br>
There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT6 ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far.<br>
One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT6 receptor function is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's.<br>

WO 2004/009600<br><br>
PCT/US2003/022506<br><br>
The high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex suggest a rote for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C; Martres, M.-P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M.C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E1 Mestikawy, S. Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT6 receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supported the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J. British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126(7), 1537-1542).   Studies have found that a known 5-HT6 selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and cognition strongly suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in cognition (Dawson, L A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130(1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT6 antagonist found some positive effects (Rogers, p. C; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neurosdence, Abstracts 2000, 26, 680).<br>
A related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT6 ligands is the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in both children and adults. Because 5-HT6 antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and because ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M. Journal of Neurosdence 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT6 antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.<br>
Early studies examining the affinity of various CNSM ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P. Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology 2000, 40, 319-334).<br>
Further, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate 5-HT6 modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.;<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2004/009600<br><br>
PCT/US2003/022506<br><br>
Routledge, C; Upton, N. British Journal of Pharmacology 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement 131P and Routledge, C; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M. British Journal of Pharmacology 2000, 130(7), 1606-1612).<br>
Taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT6 receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g., anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke and head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances of abuse.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds which are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the compounds provided may also be used to further study and elucidate the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
These and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent by the detailed description set forth hereinbelow.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 (5-HT6) receptor is one of the most recent receptors to be identified by molecular cloning. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting said receptor. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see C. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that 1-heterocyclylalkyl-3-sulfonylazaindole and -azaindazole derivatives of formula I demonstrate 5-HT6 affinity. Advantageously, said azaindole and azaindazole derivatives may be used as<br>

Comparative Evaluation of 5-HT6 Binding Affinity of Test Compounds<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is evaluated in the following manner. Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6 receptors are harvested and centrifuged at low speed (1,000 x g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCI (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate Is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCI buffer and recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCI buffer and the tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 pi volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method<br>

PCTYUS2O03/O22506<br><br>
described in Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 193:265 (1951). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at -70° C until used in subsequent binding experiments.<br>
Binding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 //I. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 //I of incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCI buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCI2 and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 p\ of [3H]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, KQ of the [3H]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with increasing concentrations of [3H]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of 100.0 //I of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0 juM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 //I volume. The reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well unititter with a Packard Filtermate(r) 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard TopCount(r) equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.0//I Microscint(r)-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and counted in a PackardTopCount(r) with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%.<br>
Specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0/JM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism(r) yielded both the IC50 and the Rvalues of test compounds with 95% confidence limits. A linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IC50 value is determined and the Ki value is determined based upon the following equation:<br>
K, =IC50/(1 +L/KD)<br>
where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and Ko is the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.<br>
