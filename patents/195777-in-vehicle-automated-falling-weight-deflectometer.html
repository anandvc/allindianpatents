4<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, the said movement of the movable cylinder and the movement of the geophone assembly are achieved by hydraulic means.<br>
In accordance with a more preferred aspect of the present invention the in-<br>
vehicle automated falling weight deflectometer comprises:<br>
a support structure installed with respect to the vehicle floor having two vertical<br>
members supporting a horizontal member;<br>
a piston means secured to said horizontal member and extending into a movable<br>
cylinder, said cylinder having an oil inlet at the top and an oil outlet at the bottom<br>

The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the system as per the accompanying figures wherein -<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of a known conventional system of<br>
deflectometer.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the working principle of a deflectometer.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates schematically the falling weight deflectometer system in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the mounting of the geophone system of the invention in<br>
vehicle.<br>
Figure 5 shows vehicle mounted FWD system.<br>
Figure 6 is a circuit diagram of the load ceil instrumentation amplifier.<br>
Figure 7 is an integration circuit for the geophone;<br>
Figure 8 an illustration of the data acquisition system.<br>
Reference is first invited to Fig. 1 which illustrates a schematic diagram of a conventional deflection measurement system. Exact drawing and dimensions are not known. As illustrated in said figure a loading plate (3) is provided with a rubber disc at the bottom. The hydraulic cylinders (1 and 2) lower the entire assembly on the road pavement and the wheel of the trolley get lifted up so that the loading plate (3) is partially loaded. The part (5) is lowered till part (11) gets engaged to (5). The mass (10) is lifted by hydraulic cylinder (4) until the limiting switch on the top. When (5) is released by a hydraulic signal, the mass (10) falls on the rubber pad of specific hardness.<br><br>
6<br>
Reference is invited to Fig. 2 which schematically illustrates the working principle of falling load deflectometer. As represented in said figure failing weight deflectometers (FWDs) are systems for performing non-destructive testing of pavement and other foundation structures. The system develops forces from the acceleration caused by the arrest of a falling weight and these forces are transmitted onto the surface of a structure causing it to deflect much as it would due to the weight of a passing wheel load. The deformation of the structure is referred to as a "deflection basin" and the FWD uses a series of user positioned sensors to automatically determine the amplitude and shape of this deflected basin. The deflection response, when related to the applied loading, can provide information about the strength and condition of the various elements of the test structure. There are several back calculation programs available that can be used to evaluate pavement and foundation structures from the data produced by the FWD.<br>
Reference is now invited to Fig. 3 which illustrates the falling weight<br>
deflectometer in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in said Fig.<br>
3, the system of the invention having a frame of steel joists (SJ) which supports<br>
the entire assembly. A piston (P) is firmly fixed at right angled to the horizontal<br>
steel joist. Cylinder (C) is movable and when oil is pumped in through the upper<br>
inlet (UI) of the cylinder, the cylinder with rubber pad (RP), load cell (LC)<br>
	geophone (GP), loading plate (LP) with rubber sole (RS) presses against the<br>
	road surface. The rear wheels of the vehicle are slightly lifted up. Geophone<br>
assembly which is touching the lower part of the floor of the vehicle is lowered down by another hydraulic cylinder to rest on the road with geophone pressed against the road surface due to the weight of the frame. The catch is pulled back hydraulically and the mass falls on the synthetic rubber pad of shore hardness 35. The impact generated is measured by the load cell and it is found that the impact duration (the pulse width of the impulse) is about 25 milliseconds as required for a pavement.<br>
The load cell consists of four number of 350 ohm resistance strain gauge with gauge factor of two. The signal from the load cell is amplified by an instrumentation amplifier IC 524 of analog Devices before the signal goes to the<br><br>
7<br>
computer. The geophones have a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz and displacement of amplitude ± 1.25 mm. Both load cells and the geophones are required to be calibrated before use and frequent calibration (once in six months) is necessary. Signals from the geophones are integrated by an electronic circuits before they are recorded in the computer, A data acquisition card PCL-208 is fitted in the computer. The card can accomplish 100 KHz sampling rate in DMA mode the input to the card can be Bipolar, the maximum range being ± 10 V.<br>
Any known functional software can be used for data acquisition, There is provision of external pulse trigger. Seven data, six from the geophone and one from load cell are acquired at a rate of 2000Hz per channel (14000 Hz rate for all the signals).<br>
Fig. 5 shows a general view of the van/vehicle mounted with the deflection measuring system in accordance with the present invention. As also illustrated in said figure, the vehicle floor supports the frame structure holding the movable cylinder with the deflection measuring unit. The load is also supported by the said frame structure which can preferably be a steel joist. Therebetween the vertical columns of the steel Joist, the vehicle floor is cut out to favour movement of the deflection measuring unit especially the geophone member therethrough to touch the ground. The vehicle also accommodates the required electronic circuitry and the composition for data generation based on signals received from the load cell and the geophone.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the circuit for the instrumentation amplifier. Integration circuit for the geophone is given in Fig. 7, Organisation of the data acquisition system with LVDT is shown in Fig. 8. LVDT is used for calibration of geophones. Typical calibration factors for geophone and reproducibility of test data are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br>

Power for running the hydraulic pump can be derived from battery also using a DC motor.<br>
Advantageously, on the above system of the invention the same cylinder and piston combination lifts the load as well as presses the pavement. The entire system is inside a van which gives protection against rain to all components. The geophone frame also is foldable type so that during transportation no part is protruding out side the vehicle to avoid accidents.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system of deflection measurement in accordance with the invention to achieve the following advantages/benefits:<br>
i) it is in-vehicle mounted, hence no additional vehicle is required for transportation.<br><br>
ii) Power for running the hydraulic pump is derived from the vehicle engine itself where as in others, the power is derived from battery which are to be charged continuously because of heavy drain of current.<br>
iii) A single hydraulic cylinder is used to raise the weight as well as lowering the loading plate whereas it appears that two hydraulic cylinders are used for lowering and raising the loading plate and another hydraulic cylinder is used for raising the weights.<br>
iv) Geophone frame is foldable so that the entire frame is inside the vehicle and there is no protrusion outside the vehicle during long travel to testing places.<br>
v) Cost is low (total cost of fabrication in a 2nd hand Matador van was about Rs. 8.50 lakhs including a computer, data acquisition cards, geophones and electrical circuits whereas imported ones cost about Rs. 90 lakhs or higher without computer and towing vehicles)<br>
vi) Repair and maintenance will be easy because of local know-how.<br><br>
