DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
 <br>
[0016] Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, an exemplary engine<br>
assembly 10 is schematically illustrated. The engine assembly 10 may include<br>
an engine 12 including a. plurality of cylinders 14 having pistons 16 disposed<br>
therein and a crankshaft 17. The crankshaft 17 may be rotatably supported by<br>
an engine structure and may be rotationally driven by the pistons 16. The engine<br>
12 may further include an intake valve 18, an exhaust valve 20, intake and<br>
exhaust valve lift mechanisms 22, 24 for each cylinder 14, as well as a camshaft<br>
26, a cam phaser assembly 28, and a drive belt 29 (such as a chain drive) that<br>
rotatably couples the crankshaft 17 to the cam phaser assembly 28.<br>
[0017] The intake valve lift mechanisms 22 may each include a<br>
pushrod 30 and a rocker' arm 32. The exhaust valve lift mechanisms 24 may<br>
each include a pushrod 30 and a rocker arm 32 as well. The camshaft 26 may<br>
be supported by an engine structure such as an engine block. The pushrods 30<br>
may be engaged with the camshaft 26 to actuate the rocker arms 32 and open<br>
the intake and exhaust vaivSs 18, 20. While the engine assembly 10 is illustrated<br>
as a pushrod engine assembly, it is understood that the present disclosure may<br>
be applicable to a variety of other engine configurations as well, such as<br>
overhead cam engines, where the camshaft 26 is supported by a cylinder head.<br>
[0018] With reference to Figures 3 and 4, the camshaft 26 may form a<br>
concentric camshaft assembly and may include first and second shafts 34, 36, a<br>
first set of lobe members 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, and a second set of lobe<br>
members 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. The second shaft 36 may be rotatably<br>
disposed within the first shaft 34. The first set of lobe members 38, 39, 40, 41,<br>
 <br>
42, 43, 44, 46 may be fixed for rotation with the first shaft 34 and the second set<br>
of lobe members 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 may be fixed for rotation with the<br>
second shaft 36. In the present example, the first set of lobe members 38, 39,<br>
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46 may form an intake lobe set and the second set of lobe<br>
members 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 may form an exhaust lobe set. However,<br>
it is understood that alternate arrangements may be provided where the first set<br>
of lobe members 38,39,40, 41, 42, 43, 44; 46 may form an exhaust lobe set and<br>
the second set of lobe member 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 may form ah<br>
intake lobe set.	<br>
[0019] With reference to Figures 3 and 5, the cam phaser assembly 28<br>
may include a drive plate assembly 56, a cavity plate 58, and a driven plate<br>
assembly 60. The drive plate assembly 56 may be rotatably supported on the<br>
engine structure and may include a drive plate 62, a drive hub 64, and a series of<br>
vanes 66. The drive hub 64 may be integrally formed on the drive plate 62 and<br>
may include a series of teeth 67. The drive hub 64 may be driven by the<br>
crankshaft through engagement with the belt 29 (seen in Figure 2). The vanes<br>
66 may be fixed for rotation with the drive plate 62. While the drive plate<br>
assembly 56 includes three vanes 66 in the present example, it is understood<br>
that more or fewer vanes may be used.<br>
[0020] The cavity plate 58 may be located axially between the drive<br>
plate assembly 56 and the driven plate assembly 60. With additional reference<br>
to Figures 6 and 7, the cavity plate 58 may include a body 68 that defines a first<br>
set of chambers 70 and a second set of chambers 72. Each of the first<br>
 <br>
chambers 70 may be equally spaced from one another and may have a first<br>
angular span (Ø1) and each of the second chambers 72 may be equally spaced<br>
and may have a second angular span (Ø2). The first angular span (Ø1) may be<br>
significantly greater than the second angular span (Ø2). More specifically, the first<br>
angular span (Ø1) may be at least twice the second angular span (Ø2). The first<br>
angular span (Ø1) may be between 20 and 30 degrees and the second angular<br>
span (02) may be between 5 and 15 degrees. In the present example, the first<br>
angular span (Ø1) may be approximately three times the second angular span <br>
(02). The number of first chambers 70 may correspond to the number of second<br>
chambers 72. The first chambers 70 may be located between adjacent ones of<br>
the second chambers 72.<br>
[0021] The driven plate assembly 60 may include a driven plate 74 and<br>
a series of vanes 76. The varies 76 are shown exploded from the driven plate 74<br>
in Figure 5. When assembled, the vanes 76 may be fixed for rotation with the<br>
driven plate 74. While the driven plate assembly 60 includes three vanes 76 in<br>
the present example, it is understood that more or fewer vanes may be used.<br>
The vanes 66 may extend axially into the first chambers 70 and the vanes 76<br>
may extend axially into the second chambers 72.<br>
[0022] The first shaft 34 may be fixed for rotation with the cavity plate<br>
58 and the second shaft 36 may be fixed for rotation with the driven plate<br>
assembly 60. Therefore, when the first set of lobe members 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,<br>
43, 44, 46 form an intake lobe set and the second set of lobe members 48, 49,<br>
50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 form an exhaust lobe set, the intake lobe set may be fixed<br>
 <br>
for rotation with the cavity plate 58 and the exhaust lobe set may be fixed for<br>
rotation with the driven plate assembly 60. Alternatively, the first shaft 34 may be<br>
fixed for rotation with the driven plate assembly 60 and the second shaft 36 may<br>
be fixed for rotation with the cavity plate 58.<br>
[0023] During operation, pressurized fluid, such as engine oil, may be<br>
supplied to the first and second chambers 70, 72 to provide a hydraulic<br>
engagement between the vanes 66, 76 and the cavity plate 58. The hydraulic<br>
engagement may transfer rotation of the drive plate assembly 56 to the cavity<br>
plate 58 and to the driven plate assembly 60 to drive rotation of the camshaft 26.<br>
More specifically, the drive plate assembly 56 may drive rotation of the cavity<br>
plate 58 and the cavity plate 58 may drive rotation of the driven plate assembly<br>
60. Thus, the drive plate assembly 56 may indirectly drive rotation of the driven<br>
plate assembly 60. <br>
[0024] Based on the pressurized fluid supplied to the first and second<br>
chambers 70, 72, the cavity plate 58 and the driven plate assembly 60 may each<br>
be rotated relative to the drive plate assembly 56. More specifically, the cavity<br>
plate 58 may be rotated relative to the drive plate assembly 56 based on the<br>
pressurized fluid within the first chambers 70 being applied to the vanes 66. The<br>
driven plate assembly 60 may rotate with the cavity plate 58. Alternatively, the<br>
cavity plate 58 and the driven plate assembly 60 may be rotated relative to one<br>
another. The driven plate assembly 60 may be rotated relative to the cavity plate<br>
58 based on the pressurized fluid within the second chambers 72 being applied<br>
to the vanes 76.<br>
 <br>
[0025] Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the cam phaser assembly 28 in first<br>
and second orientations. Figure 6 generally illustrates each of the cavity plate 58<br>
and the driven plate assembly 60 in a fully advanced position with the arrow<br>
representing a rotational direction of the cavity plate 58 and the driven plate<br>
assembly 60 relative to Figure 7. Figure 7 generally illustrates each of the cavity<br>
plate 58 and the driven plate assembly 60 in a fully retarded position with the<br>
arrow representing a rotational direction of displacement of the cavity plate 58<br>
and the driven plate assembly 60 relative to Figure 6. Figures 6 and 7 generally<br>
illustrate a maximum angular displacement for the cavity plate 58 relative to the<br>
drive plate assembly 56 and a maximum angular displacement for the driven<br>
plate assembly 60 relative to the drive plate assembly 56. The maximum angular<br>
displacement for the cavity plate 58 relative to the drive plate assembly 56 may<br>
be approximately equal to the first angular span (Ø1) and the maximum angular<br>
displacement for the driven plate assembly 60 relative to the drive plate<br>
assembly 56 may be approximately equal to the sum of the first and second<br>
angular spans (Ø1+ Ø2). The maximum angular displacement for the driven plate<br>
assembly 60 relative to the cavity plate 58 may be approximately equal to the<br>
second angular span (82).<br>
[0026] Therefore, since the first and second shafts 34, 36 may be fixed<br>
for rotation with the cavity plate 58 and the driven plate assembly 60, each of the<br>
first and second shafts 34, 36 may be rotatable relative to the drive plate<br>
assembly 56. Additionally, due to the engagement between the driven plate<br>
assembly 60 and the cavity plate 58, rotation of the cavity plate 58 relative to the<br>
 <br>
drive plate assembly 56 may result in rotation of the driven plate assembly 60<br>
relative to the drive plate assembly 56. In the arrangement where the exhaust<br>
cam lobe set is fixed for rotation with the driven plate assembly 60 and the intake<br>
lobe set is fixed for rotation with the cavity plate 58, the exhaust cam lobe set<br>
may be rotatable relative to the drive plate assembly 56 and the cavity plate 58 to<br>
the same degree as the driven plate assembly 60. The intake cam lobe set may<br>
be rotatable relative to the driver plate assembly 56 to the same degree as the<br>
cavity plate 58.<br>
 <br>
