				<td>Description NOVEL CRYSTALS OF FLUOROBENZAMIDE DERIVATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel crystals of (-)-A/-{2-[(/^-3-(6,7Hmethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)piperidino]ethyl}-4-fluorobenzamide monophosphate (hereinafter, referred to as "compound A") and to a process for preparing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
The compound A has been known to have an inhibitory action for If current and shows a strong and specific activity selectively lowering a heart beat and decreasing oxygen consumption of heart muscle whereby it is useful as a preventive and/or treating agent for diseases of circulatory system such as ischemic heart diseases (e.g., angina pectoris and myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, etc. (Patent Document 1).<br>
In Example 49 of the document, the compound A is specifically disclosed and is mentioned that its crystal has a melting point of 197 to 199°C. However, there is neither disclosure nor suggestion that the compound A has crystal polymorphism.<br>
In the meanwhile, in a compound where crystal polymorphism is present, various properties thereof differ depending upon crystal form and, therefore, even the same compound may sometimes show entirely different function and effect.   Particularly in Pharmaceuticals, when a compound having<br><br>
different function and effect is used with a presumption that it has the same efficacy, there is a possibility that function and effect which are different from expected ones are noted whereby unexpected accident is resulted. Accordingly, there is a demand to provide a compound of the same quality<br>
which is able to expect predetermined function and effect at all times. Therefore, when a compound in which crystal polymorphism is present is used as a pharmaceutical, it is necessary that a certain single crystal of the compound is always provided in order to ensure the uniform quality and certain function and effect which are demanded for Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Under such circumstances, in view of providing the active ingredient for Pharmaceuticals, there has been a brisk demand for crystals of the compound A by which uniform quality and certain function and effect are able to be ensured and a stable supply in an industrial production is possible and for a process for preparing the same.<br>
[Patent Document 1 ]   WO 00/75133<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have carried out intensive studies for providing the crystals of the compound A and have unexpectedly found that, due to the difference in precise preparation condition, the resulting crystal varies or, in other words, crystal polymorphism is present in the compound A.<br>
It has been also found that, among the above, crystal having a X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1 (hereinafter, the crystal will be referred to as "a-type crystal") has particularly good hygroscopicity and, therefore, it is advantageous in view of handling of the active ingredient and of<br><br>
making into pharmaceutical preparations and further that it is excellent in terms of stable supply in view of industrial production.<br>
The presence of crystal having a X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 2 which is different from the a-type crystal of the compound A (hereinafter, the crystal will be referred to as "(3-type crystal") has been found as well.<br>
Thus, the present invention has been achieved on the basis of such findings and, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided crystal of the compound A which is characterized in having main peaks near 19.36, 6.23, 4.73 and 3.81 A of lattice spacing in a X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained by the use of Cu-Ka radiation; crystal of the compound A which is characterized in that lattice spacing and relative intensity are preferably those as shown in Table 1 in a X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained by the use of Cu-Ka radiation; and crystal of the compound A which is characterized in that, in a DSC curve, the temperature of endothermic peak is near 206 to 207°C.<br>
(<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided crystal of the compound A which is characterized in having main peaks near 18.40, 6.52, 5.22, 4.38 and 4.09 A of lattice spacing in a X-ray powder<br><br>
diffraction pattern obtained by the use of Cu-Ka radiation; crystal of the compound A which is characterized in that lattice spacing and relative intensity are preferably those as shown in Table 2 in a X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained by the use of Cu-Ka radiation; and crystal of the compound A which is characterized in that, in a DSC curve, the temperature of endothermic peak is near176to177°C.<br>
 (Table Remove)<br><br>
Incidentally, in the recognition of identity of crystal, crystal lattice spacing and pattern in general are important in X-ray powder diffraction pattern in view of the data and relative intensity is more or less variable depending upon direction of crystal growth, size of particle and measuring condition whereby a strict understanding therefor should not be done.   Further, although the present invention relates to pure a-type crystal and pure p-type crystal of compound A, a mixture which is able to be understood to be substantially identical with those a-type crystal and (3-type crystal is also covered by the present invention.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated in detail as hereunder.<br>
In the data obtained from various kinds of spectra, there may be some errors depending upon direction of crystal growth, size of particle and measuring condition.   Therefore, in the present specification, the term "near"<br><br>
used in the value of lattice spacing in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern means an approximate lattice spacing value, preferably means that it may be within 1.0 A before and after the value and, more preferably, means that it may be within 0.3 A before and after the value.   In addition, the term "near" used in the value for the temperature of endothermic peak in a DSC curve means an approximate endothermic peak value, preferably means that it may be within 2°C before and after the value and, more preferably, means that it may be within 1 °C before and after the value.<br>
The a-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention is able to be manufactured in such a manner that, when the corresponding free substance is made into a salt using phosphoric acid, it is carried out at the temperature of about 30°C in an ethanol (EtOH) solvent or in an EtOH solvent to which a few amount of water is added.<br>
The (3-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention is able to be manufactured in such a manner that, when the corresponding free substance is made into a salt using phosphoric acid, it is carried out by cooling at about 5°C in an EtOH solvent or in an EtOH solvent to which a few amount of water is added.<br>
The a-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention is also able to be manufactured in such a manner that the resulting crystal is recrystallized in an EtOH solvent or in an EtOH solvent to which water is added. In conducting the recrystallization, it is possible to conduct by inoculation of seed crystal and, in order to prevent a rapid progress of crystallization, the temperature for inoculation is preferably room temperature or higher, more preferably 30°C or higher or, particularly preferably, 50°C or higher.<br><br>
The a-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention is also able to be manufactured in such a manner that a mixture of a-type crystal and (3-type crystal or p-type crystal is suspended in an EtOH solvent or in an EtOH solvent to which water is added and stirred at about 40°C.<br>
Hygroscopicity of the two kinds of hovel crystals of the compound A according to the present invention are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the a-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention is superior to the (3-type crystal in terms of hygroscopicity and, therefore, it is advantageous in view of handling of active ingredient and of manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations.   When the a-type crystal of the compound A is manufactured as a single crystal form by the above-mentioned manufacturing method, it is possible to ensure a certain quality demanded as Pharmaceuticals.    Incidentally, the a-type crystal and the p-type crystal of the compound A of the present invention are morphologically pure.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by way of the following Referential Examples and Examples, although the present invention is not limited to those Examples.<br>
Incidentally, TGA-DSC thermal analysis was conducted as follows. <tga-dsc thermal analysis><br>
A sample (5 mg) was filled in a sample container, a heating furnace was heated according to a certain heating rate (10°C/minute) and changes in calorie (DSC) and changes in thermogravity (TGA) were continuously measured and recorded.   Incidentally, handling of the apparatus including data processing<br><br>
was conducted in accordance with the methods and procedures instructed by each of the apparatuses (Instrument used: DSC 2910 and Hi-Res TGA2950).<br>
