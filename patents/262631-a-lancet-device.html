THE PRESENT INVENTION RELATES TO A LANCET DEVICE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Application No. 60/569,424 filed<br>
May 7, 2004, U.S. Application No. 60/631,846 filed November 30, 2004, U.S. Application<br>
No. 60/631,795 filed November 30,2004, and U.S. Application No. 60/669,276 filed April 7,<br>
2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to medical puncturing devices, commonly<br>
referred to as lancets, which are used to take blood samples from patients and, more<br>
specifically, to a lancet device that is designed for ease of use with activation achieved during<br>
contact of the device in normal use.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0003] Lancet devices are used in the medical field for puncturing the skin of a patient to<br>
obtain a capillary blood sample from the patient. Certain diseases, such as diabetes, require<br>
that the patient's blood be tested on a regular basis to monitor, for example, the patient's<br>
blood sugar levels. Additionally, test kits, such as cholesterol test kits, often require a blood<br>
sample for analysis. The blood collection procedure usually involves pricking a finger or<br>
other suitable body part in order to obtain the blood sample. Typically, the amount of blood<br>
needed for such tests is relatively small and a small puncture wound or incision normally<br>
provides a sufficient amount of blood for these tests.<br>
[0004] Various lancet devices are commercially available to hospitals, clinics, doctors'<br>
offices, and the like, as well as to individual consumers. Such devices typically include a<br>
sharp-pointed member such as a needle, or a sharp-edged member such as a blade, that is<br>
used to make a quick puncture wound or incision in the patient's skin in order to provide a<br>
small outflow of blood. It is often physiologically and psychologically difficult for many<br>
people to prick their own finger with a hand-held needle or blade. As a result, lancet devices<br>
have evolved into automatic devices that puncture or cut the skin of the patient upon the<br>
actuation of a triggering mechanism. In some devices, the needle or blade is kept in a<br>
standby position until it is triggered by the user, who may be a medical professional in charge<br>
of drawing blood from the patient, or the patient himself or herself. Upon triggering, the<br>
needle or blade punctures or cuts the skin of the patient, for example on the finger. Often, a<br><br>
spring is incorporated into the device to provide the "automatic" force necessary to puncture<br>
or cut the skin of the patient.<br>
[0005] It is of the utmost importance in the medical field that such medical puncturing<br>
devices or lancets are in a sterile condition before use. Today, generally without exception,<br>
medical puncturing devices or lancets are manufactured and packaged in a sterilized<br>
condition before they are distributed to medical professionals and members of the public who<br>
have a need for such devices. The sterile packaging maintains the sterility of the device,<br>
ensuring that the surrounding environment does not contaminate it until use. In addition, it is<br>
also of increasing importance that the user or another person does not come into contact with<br>
the needle or blade after use of the device. With the concern over blood-borne diseases,<br>
medical professionals are required to take great care with medical devices that come into<br>
contact with the blood of patients. Thus, an important aspect of lancet design involves<br>
preventing the needle or blade of the device from wounding the user or another person after<br>
the blood sample is drawn from the patient. Once used, the needle or blade should be<br>
shielded to prevent the needle or blade from wounding the user or another person handling<br>
the device. Moreover, the lancet device should be disposable to eliminate the chances of<br>
disease transmission due to the needle or blade being used on more than one person. In this<br>
regard, the lancet device should ideally be designed for one firing, and have safety features to<br>
prevent reuse.<br>
[0006] Advances have been made in recent years to increase safety in operating and<br>
handling used lancet devices. For example, lancet devices are currently available which are<br>
single shot devices that feature automatic ejection and retraction of the puncturing or cutting<br>
element from and into the device. Examples of such medical puncturing devices are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,432,120; 6,248,120; 5,755,733; and 5,540,709.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,432,120 to Teo discloses a lancet device that includes a lancet<br>
holder which contains a spring-loaded lancet structure. The spring-loaded lancet structure<br>
includes a single spring that effects the ejection and retraction of a lancet needle upon the<br>
triggering of the structure. U.S. Patent No. 6,248,120 to Wyszogrodzki discloses a lancet<br>
device comprised of a housing, a shielding portion, a piston with a puncturing tip, and drive<br>
and return springs that eject and retract the piston, respectively, upon the breakage of internal<br>
wing elements in the housing. U.S. Patent No. 5,755,733 to Morita discloses a lancet device<br>
that includes a combined holder and lancet structure. The lancet structure includes a lancet<br>
member with a puncturing tip and a compressible spring member that causes the lancet<br>
member to puncture the skin of a patient upon actuation of a pair of actuating arms.<br><br>
[0008] U.S. Patent No. 5,540,709 to Ramel discloses a lancet device that includes a<br>
housing enclosing a slidable trigger, "which is used to trigger a compressed spring that powers<br>
a piercing lancet member to pierce the skin of a patient. The housing includes a pair of<br>
internal fingers that engage and hold the body of the lancet member, which are then released .<br>
of engagement with the lancet member body by axial force applied by the user to the slidable<br>
trigger. Other medical puncturing devices or lancets known in the art are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,869,249 and 4,817,603. The devices disclosed in these references include a cap<br>
that is used to protect a needle or to keep the needle sterile.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] In view of the foregoing, a need generally exists in the medical field for a medical<br>
puncturing device that is easy for a user to manipulate and use while ensuring sterility before<br>
use and safe and secure disposal after use. Additionally, a need exists in the medical field for<br>
a simple, reliable, self-activating, and disposable medical puncturing device for use in<br>
collecting blood samples.<br>
[0010] A lancet device in an embodiment of the invention generally includes a housing and<br>
a lancet structure having a puncturing element, with the lancet structure disposed within the<br>
housing and adapted for movement between a retaining or pre-actuated position wherein the<br>
puncturing element is retained within the housing, and a puncturing position wherein the<br>
puncturing element extends through a forward end of the housing. The lancet device further<br>
includes a drive spring for biasing the lancet structure toward the puncturing position. The<br>
drive spring may be disposed between a rearward end of the housing and the lancet structure,<br>
and may be a separate structure or may be integrally formed with one or both of the housing<br>
and/or the lancet structure. The lancet device further includes a lever element pivotal about a<br>
fulcrum providing interference engagement with the lancet structure and retaining the lancet<br>
structure in the retracted position against the bias of the drive spring. The lever element may<br>
include a retaining hub including a pivotal lever in interference engagement with the lancet<br>
structure and pivotal about a fulcrum of the retaining hub. Movement of the housing and the<br>
retaining hub with respect to each other, such as axial or longitudinal movement, causes the<br>
lever to pivot about a fulcrum, thereby releasing the lever from interference engagement with<br>
the lancet structure and, typically, moving the lancet structure toward the rearward end of the<br>
housing to at least partially compress the drive spring. With the lancet structure released<br>
from the lever, the drive spring drives the lancet structure through the housing toward the<br>
puncturing position.<br><br>
[0011] The lever may include a shoulder in interference engagement with the lancet<br>
structure and a contact surface for engagement with an internal contact within the housing.<br>
The housing may include an internal contact therein for pivoting of the lever, which may be<br>
an integrally formed cam surface for cooperating engagement with the contact surface of the<br>
lever. The lever may be a class 1 type lever, with a pivoting point or fulcrum between the<br>
load element and the force element, such as a see-saw type of lever. Desirably, the lever is a<br>
wedge pivotally hinged to the retaining hub forming a pivot hinge defining the fulcrum for<br>
cooperative pivoting of the shoulder and the contact surface about the hinge or fulcrum.<br>
Moreover, the retaining hub may include an annular rim, with the lever pivotally hinged to<br>
the annular rim.<br>
[0012] In a further embodiment of the invention, a lancet device includes a housing and a<br>
lancet structure adapted for axial or longitudinal movement through the housing between a<br>
pre-actuated position with a puncturing element of the lancet structure retained within the<br>
housing and a puncturing position with the puncturing element extending through a forward<br>
end of the housing. A drive spring biases the lancet structure toward the puncturing position,<br>
and a retaining hub retains the lancet structure in the pre-actuated position against the bias of<br>
the drive spring. The retaining hub includes a lever pivotal about a fulcrum, with the lever in<br>
interference engagement with the lancet structure. An actuator is adapted to pivot the lever<br>
about the fulcrum to release the lever from interference engagement with the lancet structure,<br>
thereby permitting the drive spring to drive the lancet structure to the puncturing position.<br>
[0013] The actuator may include an actuator element extending through and into the<br>
housing, such as a push button element extending through a rearward end of the housing<br>
which is axially movable with respect to the housing to cause the actuator element to pivot<br>
the lever about the fulcrum. Alternatively, the actuator may include an internal contact<br>
within the housing such as an internal contact integrally formed within the housing, such that<br>
axial movement of the housing toward the retaining hub causes the internal contact within the<br>
housing to pivot the lever about the fulcrum.<br>
[0014] Desirably, the lancet device further includes a shield extending through the forward<br>
end of the housing and axially or longitudinally movable with respect to the housing, with the<br>
retaining hub adjacent the rearward end of the shield. The lancet structure may be retained<br>
by the retaining hub at the rearward end of the shield. In this manner, relative axial or<br>
longitudinal movement of the rearward end of the shield and the rearward end of the housing<br>
toward each other causes the internal contact within the housing to pivot the lever of the<br>
retaining hub, thereby actuating the device by releasing the interference engagement between<br><br>
the lever and the lancet structure. Desirably, the lancet structure and the shield include<br>
corresponding guiding surfaces for guiding the lancet structure axially or longitudinally<br>
through the shield.<br>
[0015] In a further embodiment, a lancet device includes a housing having a rearward end<br>
and a forward end having an opening extending therethrough, and a shield movable through<br>
the opening of the forward end of the housing, such as axially or longitudinally, with the<br>
shield including a lever element, such as a retaining hub adjacent a rearward end thereof,<br>
including a pivotal lever. A lancet structure with a puncturing element is disposed within the<br>
housing. The lancet structure is in interference engagement with the lever of the retaining hub<br>
at the rearward end of the shield, and is adapted for axial or longitudinal movement between<br>
a retaining or pre-actuated position with the puncturing element disposed within the housing,<br>
and a puncturing position with the puncturing element extending through a forward end of the<br>
shield. A drive spring is disposed between the housing and the lancet structure for biasing<br>
the lancet structure against the lever of the retaining hub, with the interference engagement<br>
between the lever and the lancet structure maintaining the lancet structure in the retaining or<br>
pre-actuated position. Axial or longitudinal movement of the shield toward the rearward end<br>
of the housing causes an internal contact within the housing to engage the lever of the<br>
retaining hub, thereby causing pivotal movement of the lever to release the interference<br>
engagement between the lever and the lancet structure. The drive spring may thereafter drive<br>
the lancet structure axially or longitudinally through the shield toward the puncturing<br>
position.<br>
[0016] The retaining hub desirably includes an annular rim, which may be separate from<br>
and retained within the rearward end of the shield, with at least one lever pivotally supported<br>
on the annular rim. More desirably, a pair of levers are pivotally supported on opposing sides<br>
of the annular rim. The lever may further include a shoulder for interference engagement<br>
with the lancet structure, as well as a contact surface for engagement with the internal contact<br>
of the housing to cause the lever to pivot, thereby releasing the lancet structure from<br>
interference engagement with the shoulder. For example, the internal contact of the housing<br>
may include an integrally formed cam surface for cooperating engagement with the contact<br>
surface of the lever. The lever may be in the form of a wedge pivotally hinged to the<br>
retaining hub forming a pivot hinge for cooperative pivoting of the shoulder and the contact<br>
surface.<br>
[0017] The lancet device may further include a retraction spring for retracting the lancet<br>
structure within the shield after the drive spring drives the lancet structure axially through the<br><br>
shield toward the puncturing position. For example, the retraction spring may be a<br>
compression spring positioned within the forward end of the shield for compression between<br>
the lancet structure and the forward end of the shield. The biasing force of the compression<br>
spring between the forward end of the shield and the lancet structure should exceed the<br>
biasing force of the drive spring between the rearward end of the housing and the lancet<br>
structure after the drive spring drives the lancet device to the puncturing position. In this<br>
manner, the retraction spring may retract the lancet structure within the shield and/or the<br>
housing, thereby mamtaining the puncturing element therein. The shield and housing may<br>
further include locking structure extending therebetween for maintaining the shield in fixed<br>
relation to the housing after the drive spring drives the lancet structure through the shield<br>
toward the puncturing position.<br>
[0018] In yet a further embodiment, an improved lancet device includes a housing and a<br>
lancet axially or longitudinally movable within the housing and retained within the housing<br>
against a bias of a drive spring which biases the lancet toward a puncturing position in which<br>
a puTicturing element extends through a forward end of the housing. The improved lancet<br>
device includes a retaining hub, such as an annular structure, having at least one lever in<br>
interference engagement with the lancet for retaining the lancet within the housing against the<br>
bias of the drive spring, with the lever being pivotal about a fulcrum. Pivoting of the lever<br>
about the fulcrum releases the lancet from interference engagement with the lever to permit<br>
the drive spring to drive the lancet axially or longitudinally toward the puncturing position.<br>
The lever and fulcrum may be provided on one side of a plane dissecting the retaining hub at<br>
a cross section to an axis defined by the lancet.<br>
[0019] In one variation of this embodiment, axial or longitudinal movement of the housing<br>
and the retaining hub with respect to each other causes an internal contact within the housing<br>
to pivot the lever about the fulcrum. This may be accomplished through a shield extending<br>
through a forward end of the housing and axially or longitudinally moveable with respect to<br>
the housing, with the retaining hub adjacent a rearward end of the shield. At least a portion<br>
of the lancet is axially or longitudinally moveable through the shield and the retaining hub<br>
upon release of the lancet from interference engagement with the lever. In a further variation,<br>
an actuator having an actuation element extends through and into the housing, desirably<br>
through the rearward end of the housing. Movement of the actuation element with respect to<br>
the housing causes the actuation element to pivot the lever about the fulcrum. In yet a further<br>
variation, the retaining hub may be unitary with the shield, and may be an annular structure.<br><br>
[0020] A further embodiment provides an improved method of retaining a lancet structure<br>
in a pre-actuated position within a housing against the bias of a drive spring by providing a<br>
retaining hub in the form of an annular rim including a lever in interference engagement with<br>
the lancet structure. The lever is pivotal about a fulcrum, such that pivoting of the lever<br>
about the fulcrum releases the interference engagement between the lever and the lancet<br>
structure, permitting the drive spring to drive the lancet structure toward a puncturing<br>
position with a puncturing element extending through a forward end of the housing.<br>
[0021] Yet a further embodiment provides a method of actuating a lancet device. The<br>
method includes providing a lancet device comprising a housing, a lancet structure disposed<br>
v&gt;dthin the housing and including a puncturing element retained within the housing, a drive<br>
spring biased against the lancet structure, such as between a rearward end of the housing and<br>
the lancet structure, and a retaining hub retaining the lancet structure within the housing<br>
against the bias of the drive spring through a pivotal lever in interference engagement with<br>
the lancet structure. To actuate the device, the lever is contacted with an actuator to pivot the<br>
lever, thereby sequentially causing the lancet structure to move toward the rearward end of<br>
the housing to compress the drive spring and releasing the interference engagement between<br>
the lever and the lancet structure. This release causes the drive spring to drive the lancet<br>
structure axially toward a puncturing position wherein the puncturing element extends<br>
through a forward end of the housing. Other embodiments where the drive spring is<br>
constrained from further compression are also contemplated. For example, the drive spring<br>
may reach its solid height and not permit further compression while still allowing movement<br>
of the retaining hub with respect to the housing as well as release of interference engagement<br>
between the lever and the lancet structure.<br>
[0022] The actuator desirably includes an internal contact within the housing, with the<br>
contacting step involving axially or longitudinally displacing the housing and the retaining<br>
hub toward each other to cause the internal contact of the housing to pivot the lever.<br>
Moreover, the lancet device may further include a shield extending through the forward end<br>
of the housing and axially movable with respect to the housing, with the retaining hub<br>
adjacent the rearward end of the shield for retaining the lancet structure within the housing<br>
against the bias of the drive spring. In such an embodiment, the method further includes a<br>
displacement step involving axially or longitudinally displacing the rearward end of the<br>
shield and the rearward end of the housing relative to each other to cause the contacting step.<br>
For example, the displacement step may involve applying external pressure between a<br>
forward end of the shield and the rearward end of the housing. Also, the lever may include a<br><br>
shoulder in interference engagement with the lancet structure and a contact surface for<br>
engagement with the internal contact of the housing. In this manner, the contacting step<br>
involves engaging the internal contact of the housing with the contact surface of the lever to<br>
pivot the lever.<br>
[0023] Further, the retaining hub may include an annular rim. with the lever pivotally<br>
hinged to the annular rim such that the shoulder extends radially inward of the annular rim<br>
and the contact surface is at an external perimeter of the annular rim. In this manner, the<br>
contacting step involves engaging the internal contact of the housing with the contact surface<br>
of the lever at an external perimeter of the annular rim, thereby pivoting the lever by tipping<br>
the contact surface and the shoulder to release the lancet structure through the annular rim.<br>
and through the shield.<br>
[0024] The method may involve a further step of retracting the puncturing element within<br>
' the housing after the puncturing element reaches the puncturing position. In particular, the<br>
lancet device may further include a compression spring positioned within the forward end of<br>
the shield. The retraction step involves compressing the compression spring between the<br>
lancet structure and the forward end of the shield through the bias of the drive spring and<br>
thereafter relaxing the compression spring. In an embodiment of the invention, the biasing<br>
force of the compression spring between the forward end of the shield and the lancet structure<br>
in a relaxed state exceeds the biasing force of the drive spring between the rearward end of<br>
the housing and the lancet structure after the drive spring drives the lancet device to the<br>
puncturing position. Accordingly, the puncturing element is retracted within the shield,<br>
thereby mamtaining the lancet structure within the housing.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0067] For purposes of the description hereinafter, the words "upper", "lower", "right",<br>
"left", "vertical", "horizontal", "top", "bottom", "lateral", "longitudinal", "axial", and like<br>
terms, if-used, shall relate to the invention, as it is oriented in the drawing figures.<br>
Additionally, the term "distal" shall refer to the portion of the device closest the puncture end<br><br>
and the term "proximal" shall refer to the portion of the device opposite the distal portion. It<br>
is to be understood that the invention may assume many alternative variations and<br>
embodiments except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood<br>
that the specific devices and embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings and<br>
described herein are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0068] Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a lancet device 10 according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention is generally shown. The lancet device 10 generally includes a housing 12, a shield<br>
14 movably associated with the housing 12, and a lancet structure 70 disposed therein. As<br>
will be discussed in greater detail herein, the shield 14 is coaxially and movably associated<br>
with the housing 12, and is partially disposed within the housing 12, extending partially<br>
outward from the housing 12, with the lancet structure 70 contained within and axially or<br>
longitudinally movable through the shield 14.<br>
[0069] The housing 12 defines an elongated body, and is desirably formed with a main<br>
body 20 defining a distal or forward end portion 22, and a rear cap 24 defining a proximal or<br>
rearward end portion 26. The interior portion of housing 12 is generally open defining<br>
internal cavity 28, which internal cavity 28 is closed at the rearward end through rear cap 24 •<br>
and includes an opening 30 through the forward end portion 22, through which the shield 14<br>
extends, as will be discussed in further detail herein. Main body 20 and rear cap 24 may be<br>
integrally formed. Alternatively, main body 20 and rear cap 24 are separate elements which<br>
are affixed to each other to form housing 12, which aids in assembly of lancet device 10.<br>
FIGS. 4A-4E and 5A-5E depict the main body 20 and rear cap 24, respectively, in an<br>
example of such an embodiment. Main body 20 and rear cap 24 may be affixed together<br>
through an appropriate adhesive, or may include inter-engaging structure providing a<br>
mechanical attachment therebetween, such as a frictional fit or a snap fit construction. For<br>
example, main body 20 may include an annular rim 31 defining an annular groove 32, and<br>
rear cap 24 may include an annular protrusion 33 having an annular lip 34 at mating surfaces<br>
thereof. When main body 20 and rear cap 24 are mated, annular protrusion 33 extends wthin<br>
the rear open end of main body 20, with annular lip 34 snap fitting over the annular rim 31<br>
and into the annular groove 32 of main body 20. It should be recognized that the<br>
arrangement of such elements is merely exemplary and may be reversed, and it is<br>
contemplated that other mter-fitting engaging structure may be used to fit the main body 20<br>
with the rear cap 24. In an alternate embodiment, main body 20 and rear cap 24 may be an<br>
integrally formed structure, and may therefore be molded together as one component.<br><br>
[0070] As shown in FIG. 1 IB, the generally elongated housing 12, defined by main body<br>
20 and rear cap 24, has opposed sides 35, 36, which may each include a surface for<br>
accommodating a user's fingers, such as finger grip indentations 37, 38. While two opposed<br>
finger grip indentations 37,38 are provided on the housing 12, it will be appreciated that only<br>
one finger grip indentation 37 formed in the housing body 20 may be provided in accordance<br>
with the present invention. The finger grip indentations 37 may be formed as concave<br>
depressions or recesses on the outer surface of the housing 12. Additionally, the rearward<br>
end 26 of housing 12, such as the top surface of rear cap 24, may also include a surface for<br>
accommodating a user's finger, such as rear finger grip indentation 39, which may also be<br>
formed as a concave depression or recess. The side finger grip indentations 37, 38 and the<br>
rear finger grip indentation 39 provide ergonomically shaped surfaces that substantially<br>
conform to a user's fingertips to aid the user in manipulating the lancet device 10 and using<br>
the lancet device 10 in a blood letting, drawing, or collection procedure, and may provide<br>
multiple finger grip positions for the user. The side finger grip indentations 37, 38 may be<br>
represented as contours formed by a hyperbola as shown in FIG. 11B. The hyperbola, for<br>
example, may include two asymptotes that intersect at a location substantially coplanar with a<br>
plane of symmetry defining the main housing. Additionally, rear cap 24 may include a<br>
contour formed by a hyperbola, as shown in FIG. 1 IB. The housing 12 may further include<br>
structure to generally improve the grip between the housing 12 and the user's fingertips, such<br>
as a plurality of longitudinal ribs 40 and troughs 41 extending along the housing 12 and<br>
integrally formed with the housing 12, which may provide a visual and tactile cue to the user<br>
to instruct the user where to place his or her fingertips. The housing 12 may further include<br>
at least one and optionally two or more peripheral indentations 42 disposed at the forward<br>
end 22. In one particular embodiment, the lancet device may be constructed in accordance<br>
with the features disclosed in Application No. 60/631,795 filed November 30, 2004, and<br>
entitled "Lancet Device" naming Bradley Wilkinson as inventor, the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
[0071] As noted above, the shield 14 extends outward from the opening 30 through the<br>
forward end of the housing 12. As shown in FIGS. 6A-6F, the shield 14 is a generally<br>
cylindrical hollow structure defining a shield body SO extending between a forward end 52<br>
and a rearward end 54, and defining an internal cavity 56 extending therethrough. The<br>
forward end 52 of the shield body 50 defines a forward end wall 58 including a forward<br>
opening 60 therethrough, through which the puncturing element extends when the lancet<br>
device 10 is actuated by the user, as will be discussed in more detail herein. The forward end<br><br>
wall 58 generally defines a small contact area about the distal opening 60 for contacting the<br>
intended area on the user's body which is to be punctured by the puncturing element. The<br>
reduced contact area may be made smaller (i.e., reduced in area) by providing a plurality of<br>
peripheral indentations 62 that are formed in the shield 14. The peripheral indentations 62<br>
may also provide a target indicia to visually aid the user in aiming the lancet device 10<br>
generally, and aiming the puncturing element of the lancet in particular, as will be discussed<br>
in greater detail. The peripheral indentations 62 generally resemble the peripheral<br>
indentations 42 provided on the housing 12. The peripheral indentations 42 are positioned<br>
around the perimeter of the shield 14 and may be equally spaced about the shield 14. The<br>
peripheral indentations 42 enable the user to easily visually locate the approximate discharge<br>
point of the puncturing element, thereby improving the aiming characteristics of the lancet<br>
device 10 and ensuring optimal blood flow during a skin puncturing operation.<br>
[0072] As noted, the shield 14 is axially or longitudinally movable within the housing 12.<br>
The shield 14 and housing 12 may therefore include corresponding guiding surfaces for<br>
guiding the shield 14 through the housing 12. For example, shield body 50 may include a<br>
pair of longitudinal protrusions 63 extending along an outer surface thereof, forming guide<br>
channel 64 therebetween. Housing 12 may include corresponding structure such as a guide<br>
tab 44 within the main body 20 thereof for fitting within guide channel 64. Desirably, shield<br>
body 50 includes a pair of guide channels 64 extending longitudinally along opposing sides<br>
thereof, and housing 12 includes a pair of guide tabs 44 on opposing inner surfaces of main<br>
body 20 corresponding to each of the guide channels 64. It is contemplated that the<br>
arrangement of the guide tabs and channels may be reversed, and other guiding surfaces may<br>
also be used. The guide tabs 44 and guide channels 64 ensure that the shield body 50 is<br>
properly aligned within housing 12, and provide for sliding axial movement of the shield<br>
body 50 within the housing 12, and desirably prevent or resist rotational movement.<br>
Additionally, shield body 50 may include a ledge 66 at the rearward end thereof, for<br>
interference engagement with the top surface of guide tab 44 within main body 20 of housing<br>
12. Alternatively or in addition thereto, shield body 50 may include a forward shoulder 69<br>
toward the forward end thereof, and main body 20 of housing 12 may include a forward rim<br>
surface 48, providing interference engagement therebetween. Such interferingly engaging<br>
structure prevents shield body 50 from axially sliding completely out of housing 12 through<br>
opening 30.<br>
[0073] The housing 12 and the shield 14 may further include locking structure extending<br>
therebetween, for maintaining the shield 14 in fixed relation to the housing 12 after<br><br>
activation. For example, shield body 50 may include structure at the rearward end 54 for<br>
frictional engagement, or for inter-fitting engagement, with the main body 20 or rear cap 24.<br>
For example, shield body 50 may include locking fingers 59 extending at the rearward end 54<br>
thereof, for inter-fitting engagement with locking recesses 29 within the interior surface of<br>
rear cap 24.<br>
[0074] Lancet device 10 further includes a lancet structure 70 disposed within the housing<br>
12, and extending through shield 14. As shown in FIGS. 7A-7F, lancet structure 70 includes a<br>
puncturing element, shown in the form of lancet 72 defining a puncturing end 74 at the<br>
forward end thereof. Lancet structure 70 is adapted for axial or longitudinal movement<br>
through the internal cavity 56 of the shield body 50 between an initial armed position with the<br>
puncturing end 74 maintained within the shield body 50 to a puncturing position in which the<br>
puncturing end 74 extends beyond the forward opening 60 of shield body 50, as will be<br>
discussed further herein in terms of use of the lancet device 10.<br>
[0075] Puncturing end 74 is adapted for puncturing the skin of a patient, and may define a<br>
pointed end, a blade edge, and the like. Puncturing end 74 may include a preferred alignment<br>
orientation, such as with a pointed end of a blade aligned in a specific orientation. In such an<br>
embodiment, shield body 50 and/or main body 20 of housing may include target indicia<br>
corresponding to the alignment orientation of the puncturing end 74. Indentations 62 of the<br>
shield body 50 and/or indentations 42 of the main body 20 may function as such an alignment<br>
orientation.<br>
[0076] Lancet structure 70 further includes a carrier element 76 supporting lancet 72 at the<br>
rearward end thereof. The carrier element 76 and shield body 50 may include corresponding<br>
guiding surfaces for guiding the lancet structure 70 therethrough. For example, carrier<br>
element 76 may include a guide tab 78 on an external surface thereof, with the shield body 50<br>
including a corresponding guide channel 80 extending longitudinally along an inner surface<br>
thereof for accommodating guide tab 78 slidably therein. Desirably, carrier element 76<br>
includes a pair of guide tabs 78 on opposing lateral sides thereof, and shield body 50 includes<br>
a corresponding pair of guide channels 80 extending along opposing inner surfaces thereof<br>
corresponding to each of the guide tabs 78. It is contemplated that the arrangement of the<br>
guide tabs and channels may be reversed, and other guiding surfaces may also be used. The<br>
guide tabs 78 and guide channels 80 ensure that the lancet structure 70 is properly aligned<br>
within shield body 50, and provide for sliding axial movement of the lancet structure 70<br>
within the shield body 50 and may prevent or resist rotational movement. A bottom surface<br>
81 of the guide tabs 78 provides an abutment surface for abutting against a bottom surface of<br><br>
guide channels 80 to prevent the lancet structure 70 from axial movement entirely out of<br>
t<br>
shield body 50 through forward opening 60.<br>
[0077] As shown in FIG. 10, retaining hub 90 is further provided, shown at the rearward<br>
end 54 of the shield body 50. Retaining hub 90 is desirably provided as a separate structure<br>
disposed or retained within the rearward end of shield body 50. For example, shield body 50<br>
may include structure for accommodating retaining hub 90, such as recess 68 extending<br>
within an upper surface of rearward end 54. In this manner, retaining hub 90 rests within<br>
recess 68. In other embodiments, shield body 50 may include a surface for supporting and<br>
positioning retaining hub 90 to assist in assembly. Still in other embodiments of the<br>
invention, functional elements of the retaining hub 90 may be molded or formed directly onto<br>
the shield body 50.<br>
[0078] Retaining hub 90 defines a lever structure for retaining the lancet structure 70 in an<br>
initial armed position retracted within housing 12. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 8A-8D,<br>
retaining hub 90 includes a pivotal lever element 92, including a shoulder 94 and a contact<br>
surface 96 on the upper surface thereof, with a pivot hinge 98 on the lower surface thereof<br>
between the shoulder 94 and the contact surface 96. As an example, lever element 92 defines<br>
a class 1 lever, in which the fulcrum or pivot point is positioned between the force and the<br>
load, as in a seesaw. For example, the upper surface of lever element 92 includes the<br>
shoulder 94 opposite the contact surface 96, with pivot hinge 98 providing a fulcrum between<br>
the shoulder 94 and the contact surface 96. In this manner, the load, represented by the lancet<br>
structure 70 resting on the shoulder 94, is separated from the force, which is applied at the<br>
contact surface 96 as will be described in more detail herein, with the fulcrum of pivot hinge<br>
98 located between the force and the load.<br>
[0079] As depieted in FIGS. 8A-8D, lever element 92 may be provided, in one<br>
embodiment, as a pivotal generally wedge-shaped structure, with the bottom point of the<br>
wedge acting as the fulcrum at pivot hinge 98 for pivotal movement of the lever. The<br>
retaining hub 90 may include an annular rim 100, with at least one lever element 92<br>
supported on and pivotally hinged to the annular rim 100 through the pivot hinge 98.<br>
Retaining hub 90 typically includes a pair of lever elements 92 pivotally hinged to the upper<br>
surface of the annular rim 100 at opposing sides thereof. Annular rim 100 is depicted herein<br>
as a generally rectangular ring-like structure with curved corner connections, extending<br>
circumferentially or perimetrically to define an interior opening. The term "annular" as used<br>
herein is intended to encompass any ring-like or band-like structure, whether circular, curved,<br>
or polygonal, including curved or angular corner connections. It is also contemplated that<br><br>
other annular yet incomplete rings or band-like structures may be used, such, as a structure<br>
similar to a slotted or slip-on washer, which has a discontinuous annular structure.<br>
[0080] Retaining hub 90 and lancet structure 70 are in interference engagement with each<br>
other, such that retaining hub 90 retains the lancet structure 70 in an initial armed position<br>
retracted within housing 12. For example, carrier element 76 may include a finger 82<br>
extending laterally therefrom, including a support surface 83 on a bottom surface of the<br>
finger 82. Support surface 83 of finger 82 rests on shoulder 94 of lever element 92, thereby<br>
providing interference engagement between the lancet structure 70 and the retaining hub 90.<br>
[0081] Moreover, contact surface 96 of lever element 92 is adapted for contacting<br>
engagement with structure within housing 12. For example, rear cap 24 of housing 12 may<br>
include structure extending therein, such as internal contact 46 integrally formed and<br>
extending on at least one, and desirably on two opposing inner sidewalls thereof. Each<br>
internal contact 46 includes an engagement surface 47 for contacting engagement with<br>
contact surface 96 of lever element 92, forming a cam surface. In one embodiment, contact<br>
surface 96 includes a generally rod-shaped portion 97, and the internal surface of rear cap 24<br>
includes a pair of internal contacts 46 extending adjacent each other on the inner wall surface,<br>
and on each opposing side of the inner wall surface. In this manner, the pair of internal<br>
contacts 46 engages opposing ends of the rod shaped portion 97 of contact surface 96,<br>
thereby providing a continual cam-like contact surface around the perimeter of the rod shaped<br>
portion 97 during pivotal movement of lever element 92. In an alternate embodiment shown<br>
in FIG. 8E, contact surface 96 may include angular surfaces 197 forming a chamfered portion<br>
as opposed to the generally rod-shaped portion discussed above. Such a chamfered portion<br>
formed by angular surfaces 197 is particularly useful in molding operations for forming of the<br>
retaining hub 90 in conventional injection molding procedures. With such an embodiment,<br>
the pair of internal contacts 46 within rear cap 24 engages opposing ends of the chamfered<br>
portion formed by the angular surfaces 197 of contact surface 96, providing for a cam-like<br>
contact surface as noted above.<br>
[0082] Moreover, lever element 92 is typically positioned on one side of a plane, shown in<br>
FIG. 8D at plane Y, dissecting the annular rim 100 at a cross section to the general<br>
longitudinal axis A which generally defines the lancet device 10 and the direction of travel of<br>
lancet structure 70. In this manner, the fulcrum, such as that defined through pivot hinge 98,<br>
represents a low area moment of inertia above the plane Y, such as at the top surface of<br>
annular rim 100, to cause plastic deformation of lever element 92, and namely pivot hinge 98,<br><br>
K	7<br>
as the lever element 92 pivots outwardly. Such plastic deformation may be permanent, such<br>
that after the lever elements pivot, they maintain their shape and position.<br>
[0083] Movement of the lancet structure 70 through the lancet device 10 is achieved<br>
through a biasing force provided through a drive spring 102. Drive spring 102 is adapted to<br>
exert a biasing force against lancet structure 70 to drive lancet structure 70 through the device<br>
toward the puncturing position, and may be disposed between the rearward end of the<br>
housing 12 and the lancet structure 70. Drive spring 102 may be a separate element<br>
contained between the rearward end of housing 12 and the lancet structure 70, or may be<br>
integrally formed with one or both of housing 12 and/or lancet structure 70. Rear cap 24 may<br>
include structure for alignment of and/or for mamtaining drive spring 102 in the proper<br>
orientation. For example rear cap 24 may include an alignment nub 104 for accommodating<br>
the drive spring 102. The lancet structure 70 may also include a surface or structure for<br>
accommodating an opposing end of the drive spring 102, such as a rear nub 86 extending<br>
from the carrier element 76 of lancet structure 70. Drive spring 102 extends between<br>
alignment nub 104 of rear cap 24 and rear nub 86 of carrier element 76. When the lancet<br>
structure 70 is in an armed position, the drive spring 102 exerts a force against the lancet<br>
structure, such as between the rearward end of housing 12 and the lancet structure 70, biasing<br>
the lancet structure 70 toward the puncturing position. The shield body 50 and lever element<br>
92 may include inter-engaging structure to prevent lever element 92 from pivoting in a<br>
reverse direction about pivot hinge 98, regardless of the biasing force applied against lancet<br>
structure 70 and shoulder 94 through drive spring 102. For example, bottom angled surfaces<br>
99 formed from the wedge-shaped lever element 92 may engage and abut corresponding<br>
angled nibs 55 on the rearward end 54 of shield body 50. Such inter-engaging surfaces<br>
prevent any applied force from drive spring 102 from pivoting the lever element 92 about<br>
pivot hinge 98 in a reverse direction, that is in a direction such that shoulder 94 pivots<br>
downwardly into interior cavity 56 of shield body 50. Optionally or in addition thereto, the<br>
plastic deformation of pivot hinge 98 as discussed above may be permanent, thereby<br>
preventing lever element 92 from automatically pivoting in a reverse direction to enable the<br>
lancet structure 70 to be re-set in a pre-actuation state resting on shoulder 94 after actuation.<br>
[0084] A retraction spring 110 may further be provided at the forward end of the lancet<br>
device 10, for retracting the lancet structure 70 within the shield body 50 after the lancet<br>
structure 70 is axially moved to the puncturing position. Retraction spring 110 typically<br>
extends between a forward surface 88 of the carrier element 76 of lancet structure 70 and an<br><br>
inner surface within the forward end wall 58 of the shield body 50. Retraction spring 110 is<br>
typically a compression spring, capable of storing energy when in a compressed state.<br>
[0085] Lancet device 10 may further include a protective cover 120 for protectively<br>
covering the lancet device 10 prior to use thereof. The protective cover 120 may include a<br>
tab member 122 associated with the forward end of the lancet device 10, which maintains<br>
sterility of the forward end wall 58 of shield body 50. Referring to FIGS. 9A-9F, tab member<br>
122 may include a forward tab portion 124 and a depending skirt 126. The depending skirt<br>
126 is adapted to cooperate with the forward end 52 of the shield body 50, generally<br>
encompassing or enclosing the forward end 52. The depending skirt 126 also contacts the<br>
forward end 22 of the main body 20 of the housing 12. In this manner, the tab member 122<br>
encloses forward opening 30 of main body 20 and forward opening 60 of shield body 50.<br>
Moreover, such arrangement maintains the respective forward ends of main body 20 and<br>
shield body 50 in fixed relation with respect to each other, thereby preventing movement<br>
therebetween which could cause premature activation of the lancet device 10.<br>
[0086] A portion of the protective cover 120 may extend within the shield body 50 to<br>
encompass at least a portion of the puncturing element. For example, as shown in FIG. 11D,<br>
a post portion 130 extends through forward opening 60 of shield body 50 and into internal<br>
cavity 56 thereof, protectively surrounding and encompassing at least a portion of the<br>
puncturing element, namely lancet 72. The post portion 130 and tab member 122 may be<br>
separate elements which are affixed or otherwise maintained together. For example, tab<br>
member 122 may include an inner opening for accommodating post portion 130<br>
therethrough. Referring generally to FIGS. 7A-7E, post portion 130 may be formed<br>
integrally with carrier element 76 of lancet structure 70, completely encompassing lancet 72,<br>
thereby mamtaining sterility thereof prior to use. Post portion 130 and carrier element 76<br>
may include a notched portion 132 at a juncture therebetween, providing a fraction point for<br>
removing post portion 130 and exposing lancet 72. Alternatively, the post portion 130 may<br>
be secured directly to the lancet 72 by methods customary in the medical field, such as with a<br>
releasable medical grade adhesive.<br>
[0087] In one embodiment, the rear cap 24 and the housing body 20 are separate structures<br>
which are mated, with the housing body 20 forming a forward portion of the housing 12 and<br>
the rear cap 24 forming a substantial rear portion of the housing 12. More particularly, the<br>
rear cap 24 may constitute a significant portion of the housing 12, such as approximately half<br>
of the housing 12, mating with the housing body 20 at a location dividing housing 12<br>
approximately in half when measured by the complete longitudinal length of the housing and<br><br>
rear cap together. Such an arrangement provides for simplified assembly of the lancet device<br>
10, in that the internal components including shield 14, lancet structure 70, and the retaining<br>
and engaging elements including retaining hub 90, drive spring 102 and optionally retraction<br>
spring 110, may be inserted within the housing body 20 from the rearward end thereof,<br>
requiring little clearance provided by the small size of housing body 20 for insertion.<br>
Additionally, after inserted as such, such internal elements may be easily seen due to the low<br>
clearance provided by the relative small size housing body 20 with respect to the overall<br>
housing 12, thereby permitting easy visual assurance of proper alignment. Moreover, the rear<br>
cap 24 may then be fitted to housing body 20 at a location adjacent the internal functional<br>
components, such as at a location substantially peripheral to the retaining hub 90 vrithin the<br>
housing 12. Also, the housing body 20 and the rear cap 24 may mate at a substantial<br>
midpoint of the total length of the housing 12, with each substantially defining a half portion<br>
of the housing 12. In this manner, the mating of the housing body 20 and the rear cap 24<br>
substantially intersects or bisects the finger grip indentations 37,38.<br>
[0088] The respective elements of the lancet device of the present invention are all<br>
typically formed of molded plastic material, such as a medical grade plastic material. The<br>
lancet 72 may be constructed of any suitable material adapted for puncturing the skin, and is<br>
typically a surgical grade metal such as stainless steel.<br>
[0089] Use of the lancet device 10 will now be described with general reference to FIGS.<br>
1-18, and particular reference to FIG. 1 ID and FIGS. 12-18. Prior to use, lancet device 10 is<br>
provided as shown in FIGS. 1 and 1 ID, with protective cover 120 covering shield 14 at the<br>
forward end thereof. Lancet device 10, and in particular lancet structure 70, is in an initial<br>
pre-actuation state, with finger 82 of carrier element 76 abutting or resting upon shoulder 94<br>
of the lever element 92 in interference engagement therewith. In this manner, lever element<br>
92 of the retaining hub 90 maintains lancet structure 70 in this pre-actuation position within<br>
housing 12, and in particular with puncturing end 74 maintained retracted within shield body<br>
50. Further, drive spring 102 extends between the lancet structure 70 and the rear cap 24 of<br>
housing 12. In this pre-actuation position, drive spring 102 may be in a relaxed state or may<br>
be in a fully compressed state. More desirably, drive spring 102 is in a partially compressed<br>
state in this pre-actuation position, exerting a biasing force between rear cap 24 and lancet<br>
structure 70, with the interference engagement between finger 82 and shoulder 94<br>
mamtaining lancet structure 70 against any such biasing force. Moreover, the inter-engaging<br>
surfaces between bottom angled surfaces 99 and angled nibs 55 prevent lever element 92<br>
from pivoting in a reverse direction, thereby forcing lancet structure 76 through shield body<br><br>
50. Also, in this state, protective cover 120 prevents any axial movement of shield 14 with<br>
respect to housing 12, thereby preventing actuation of the lancet device 10.<br>
[0090] To prepare the lancet assembly for use, the user grasps housing 12, such as between<br>
a ringer and thumb on opposing sides 35, 36, and removes the protective cover 120 from the<br>
forward end as shown in FIG. 2, thereby exposing the shield body 50 extending from the<br>
forward end of main body 20 of housing 12. The forward tab portion 124 of the tab member<br>
122 may be ergonomically formed, such as through the inclusion of a paddle-shaped member,<br>
to allow the user to easily manipulate the tab member 122 and apply the necessary force or<br>
torque to release the depending skirt from frictional engagement with the forward end of the<br>
shield body 50, and to break the post portion 130 from the carrier element 76 at the notch 132<br>
to thereby, release the post portion 130 from the lancet 72. The applied breaking force is in<br>
accordance with the present invention and may be a singular twisting or pulling motion, or a<br>
combined "twisting" (i.e. rotational) and "pulling" motion applied for breaking the<br>
connection between the post portion 130 and the carrier element 76, as well as to release the<br>
frictional engagement between the depending skirt 126 and the shield body 50.<br>
[0091] The forward end wall 58 of shield body 50 may then be contacted with a location<br>
on the user's body or another person's body where it is desired to initiate blood flow, such as<br>
the patient's skin surface S as shown in FIG. 13. If provided, target indicia, such as<br>
indentations 62, may be aligned with the desired location of puncture.<br>
[0092] Once placed against the body, the user exerts a downwardly directed force on the<br>
housing 12 forcing shield body 50 against skin surface S. In particular, the user applies a<br>
. force against the finger grip indentation 39 of the rear cap 24 in the direction of Arrow X,<br>
thereby applying a force against the skin surface S. Such force establishes an opposing<br>
external pressure force between the forward end wall 58 of the shield body 50 and the rear<br>
cap 24 of the housing 12 causing the shield body 50 to move axially within the housing 12,<br>
thereby displacing the rearward end 54 of the shield body toward the rear cap 24. The<br>
corresponding guiding surfaces provided through guide tabs 44 and guide channels 64 guide<br>
the shield body 50 axially through the main body 20 of housing 12, ensuring proper axial<br>
- alignment therebetween.<br>
[0093] Since retaining hub 90 is adjacent rearward end 54 of shield body 50, such<br>
displacement of the rearward end 54 of the shield body toward the rear cap 24 causes<br>
corresponding rearward movement of retaining hub 90 toward rear cap 24. Moreover, the<br>
interference engagement between shoulder 94 of lever element 92 of retaining hub 90 and<br>
ringer 82 of carrier element 76 of lancet structure 70 causes corresponding rearward<br><br>
movement of lancet structure 70 toward the rear cap 24. Such movement causes drive spring<br>
102 to compress. In embodiments in which drive spring 102 is in a relaxed state in the initial<br>
pre-actuated position, this compressing of drive spring 102 arms drive spring 102 with a<br>
biasing force sufficient to propel lancet structure 70 axially forward through shield body 50 to<br>
the puncturing position, thereby providing lancet structure 70 in an armed position. At this<br>
point, however, lancet structure 70 is still maintained such that pimcturing end 74 is retracted<br>
within shield body 50 due to the interference engagement between finger 82 and shoulder 94.<br>
In embodiments in which drive spring 102 is in a partially compressed state in the initial pre-<br>
actuated position, this compressing of drive spring 102 further arms drives spring 102 with<br>
additional biasing potential energy sufficient to fully propel lancet structure 70 axially<br>
forward through shield body 50 to the puncturing position. Again, in this pre-actuated armed<br>
position, lancet structure 70 is still maintained such that puncturing end 74 is retracted within<br>
shield body 50 based on the interference engagement between finger 82 and shoulder 94.<br>
[0094] During such axial or longitudinal movement of shield body 50 toward rear cap 24,<br>
the retaining hub 90 is also displaced rearwardly (or proximally) toward rear cap 24, with<br>
fingers 82 of the carrier element 76 resting upon shoulders 94 of the lever elements 92. As<br>
shown in FIGS. 13-14, such rearward movement of retaining hub 90 causes the cam surfaces<br>
of engagement surfaces 47 of the internal contacts 46 within rear cap 24 to engage and co-act<br>
with the corresponding contact surfaces 96 of lever elements 92, such as the rod shaped<br>
portions 97. Accordingly, the corresponding camming contact surfaces provide an actuator<br>
element for the lancet device 10. Such engagement and co-action causes the lever elements<br>
92 to pivot about pivot hinges 98 with respect to annular rim 100 due to the wedge-shaped<br>
profile of the lever elements 92. In particular, with the shoulders 94 extending generally<br>
radially inwardly of the annular rim 100 and the contact surfaces 96 generally on an external<br>
perimeter of the annular rim 100, engagement surfaces 47 engage the contacting surfaces 96,<br>
and in particular the rod shaped portions 97, at an external perimeter of the annular rim 100,<br>
thereby pivoting the lever element 92 about the fulcrum of pivot hinge 98 by tipping the<br>
contact surfaces 96 and the shoulders 94 to release the lancet structure through the annular<br>
rim 100 and into the internal cavity 56 of the shield body 50.<br>
[0095] Such engagement provides for actuation of the lancet device. In particular, the<br>
pivoting of lever elements 92 about pivot hinges 98 further displaces shoulders 94 toward the<br>
rearward end of rear cap 24, thereby further compressing and further biasing drive spring<br>
102. ' Continued axial displacement of shield body 50 toward rear cap 24 causes further<br>
engagement of the corresponding surfaces of internal contacts 46 and contact surfaces 96,<br><br>
such that engagement surfaces 47 cam or ride about the perimeter of rod-shaped portions 97,<br>
thereby further pivoting lever elements 92. Eventually, such pivoting causes shoulders 94 to<br>
be pivoted to a point at which the interference engagement between shoulders 94 and fingers<br>
82 of carrier element 76 is released, as shown in FIGS. 15-16. At this point, fingers 82 are<br>
free from shoulders 94 and may axially move through the internal opening through annular<br>
rim 100. The biasing force of drive spring 102 propels lancet structure 70 downward away<br>
from the rear cap 24 axially through housing 12 and shield body 50. During such movement,<br>
corresponding guide tabs 78 and guide channels 80 guide lancet structure 70 axially through<br>
shield body 50. Moreover, shield body 50 may further include additional channels in<br>
aUgnment with and adapted for accommodating fingers 82 of lancet structure 70 in sliding<br>
relation during'such axial movement therethrough.<br>
[0096] Actuation of the lancet device 10 is therefore achieved through the interfering or<br>
camming engagement contact between the engagement surfaces 47 and contact surfaces 96,<br>
providing the pivoting movement of lever element 92. As noted, such pivoting movement<br>
results in both compression of drive spring 102 to arm or to further arm the lancet structure<br>
70 and sequential release of the interference engagement mamtaining the lancet structure 70<br>
in the pre-actuated or armed position. Accordingly, actuation of the lancet device 10<br>
achieves sequential arming and release of the lancet structure through a single motion of the<br>
device. Moreover, such sequential arming and release merely requires movement of the<br>
inter-engaging contact surfaces between the housing 12 and the pivoting lever element 92. It<br>
is therefore contemplated that such sequential arming and release may be attained regardless<br>
of whether an axially moveable shield is included, so long as some mechanism for movement<br>
of the inter-engaging surfaces with respect to each other is provided.<br>
[0097] For example, FIG. 19 depicts a cross-sectional view of a lancet device 10a in an<br>
alternate embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, actuation is achieved<br>
through an actuator including an actuation element, such as push button 25a. In particular,<br>
housing 12a is defined by main body 20a and rear cap 24a. Push button 25a extends through<br>
housing 12a at rear cap 24a, and into the internal cavity 28a therein. Actuation of lancet<br>
device 10a is accomplished by axially moving push button 25a within housing 12a, such that<br>
one or more engagement surfaces 47a at the forward end of push button 25a within housing<br>
12a contact the corresponding contact surface(s) 96a of lever element 92a, thereby pivoting<br>
the lever element 92a about pivot hinge 98a. As in the aforementioned embodiment, such<br>
contacting and pivoting releases the interference engagement between the support surface<br>
83a of carrier element 76a and the shoulder 94a of lever element 92a, thereby permitting<br><br>
drive spring 102a to propel lancet 72a through housing 12a to the puncturing position. Drive<br>
spring may be maintained between carrier element 76a and push button 25a through<br>
alignment nub 104a within push button 25a. Alternatively, the drive spring may be<br>
maintained between the carrier element and the rearward end of the housing, with the push<br>
button element extending through the housing to cause pivotal actuation.<br>
[0098] Returning to the actuation as shown in FIG. 17, the biasing force of drive spring<br>
102 propels the lancet structure 70 through shield body 50 to a puncturing position, in which<br>
puncturing end 74 of lancet 72 extends through the forward opening 60 through forward end<br>
wall 58 a sufficient distance to permit the puncturing end 74 to puncture the skin surface S.<br>
The bottom surface 81 of the guide channels 80 within shield body 50 provides an abutment<br>
surface for guide tab 78 to prevent the lancet structure 70 from axial movement entirely out<br>
of shield body 50 through forward opening 60 during such propelling. Moreover, during<br>
such propelling, the forward surface 88 of carrier element 76 contacts the rearward end of<br>
retraction spring 110, which is maintained within the forward end 52 of shield body 50,<br>
desirably in a relaxed condition in the pre-actuated and/or armed state of the lancet device.<br>
The propelling force from the bias of drive spring 102 causes such contact with retraction<br>
spring 110, thereby compressing retraction spring 110 between the forward surface 88 of<br>
lancet structure 70 and the interior of the forward end wall 58 of shield body 50. The<br>
structure of retraction spring 110 is designed such that it is compressible, based upon the<br>
biasing force of drive spring 102 propelling lancet structure 70, to permit puncturing end 74<br>
of lancet 72 to extend through forward opening 60. Moreover, the retraction spring 110 is a<br>
compression spring, and is therefore capable of being compressed in this manner, but<br>
includes sufficient resiliency to return to a relaxed condition after the lancet structure 70<br>
extends to the puncturing position. Accordingly, the biasing force of the compression spring<br>
110 between the forward end wall 58 of the shield body 50 and the lancet structure 70 when<br>
in a relaxed state exceeds the biasing force of the drive spring 102 acting between the rear<br>
cap 24 of the housing 12 and the rear nub 86 of the lancet structure 70 after the drive spring<br>
drives the lancet structure 70 to the puncturing position. In this manner, the retraction spring<br>
110 will relax to an uncompressed state, thus applying a biasing force between the forward<br>
surface 88 of the lancet structure 70 and the interior surface of the forward end wall 58,<br>
thereby forcing the lancet structure 70 rearward toward the rear cap 24. Such biasing force<br>
retracts the puncturing end 74 of lancet 72 within the shield body 50 to a position in which it<br>
is shielded from exposure through forward opening 60. Moreover, the opposing forces acting<br>
between the drive spring 102 and the retraction spring 110, and the respective forces of such<br><br>
springs based on the structure thereof, maintains the .lancet structure 70 disposed within the<br>
housing 12 with puncturing end 74 shielded within shield body 50, preventing further<br>
movement of lancet structure 70 to the puncturing position.<br>
[0099] Moreover, after activation of the lancet device, that is, after the lancet structure 70<br>
is retracted within the housing 12 after the puncturing position, the shield body 60 and the<br>
housing 12 may be locked in a fixed relation. In particular, with shield body SO axially<br>
displaced toward the rear cap 24, locking fingers 59 may deflect and lock within respective<br>
recesses 29, thereby locking shield body 50 in a rearward position with respect to rear cap 24<br>
and housing 12. The lancet device 10 is therefore safely protected from re-use and may be<br>
properly discarded, such as in an appropriate medical waste container.<br>
[00100] Referring to FIGS. 20-22, the lancet device may include a modified version of a<br>
retaining hub 90i. FIG. 20 shows the retaining hub 90i as part of the lancet device 10 as<br>
disclosed above, with similar reference numbers shown in FIGS. 20-22 referring to similar<br>
elements described in connection with FIGS. 1-18. Retaining hub 90i generally defines an<br>
annular shape and is adapted to maintain the lancet structure 70 in an initial armed position<br>
retracted within the housing defined by main body 20 and rear cap 24. Retaining hub 90i<br>
typically includes two opposed and elongated support members 91i connected by two pivotal<br>
cam elements 92i to form the annular shape of retaining hub 90i. Cam elements 92i each<br>
include two outward-extending shafts 93i engaged pivotally with the opposed support<br>
members 91i. Cam elements 92i each further include at least one typically wedge-shaped<br>
contact element 94i defining an upper contact surface 96i on the upper surface thereof. Cam<br>
elements 92i each further define a generally centrally located recess or cut-out lOOi defined in<br>
a bottom side thereof. The purpose of recess lOOi is described herein in connection with the<br>
operation of retaining hub 90i in lancet device 10. As shown in FIGS. 21A and 22, the cam<br>
elements 92i desirably each include two contact elements 94i disposed generally at opposite<br>
ends of the cam elements 92i, with the recess lOOi defined in the bottom side of the cam<br>
elements 92i between the contact elements 94i.<br>
[00101] In the lancet device of this embodiment, retaining hub 90i and lancet structure 70<br>
are in interference engagement with each other, such that retaining hub 90i retains the lancet<br>
structure 70 in an initial armed state retracted within the housing. For example, fingers 82 on<br>
carrier element 76 may rest on the upper side of cam elements 92i, thereby providing<br>
interference engagement between the lancet structure 70 and the retaining hub 90i.<br>
Moreover, upper contact surface 96i on the contact elements 94i may be adapted for<br>
contacting engagement with structure within the housing. For example, rear cap 24 may<br><br>
include structure extending therein, such as internal contact 46 integrally formed and<br>
extending on at least one, and desirably on two opposing inner sidewalls thereof. As<br>
retaining hub 90i typically includes two contact elements 94i on each cam element 92i, two<br>
internal contacts such as contacts 46 described above may be provided on each of the two<br>
opposing inner sidewalls of the housing. Each internal contact includes a distal engagement<br>
cam surface such as cam surface 47 described above for contacting engagement with the<br>
corresponding contact surface 96i on contact elements 94i.<br>
100102] During usual operation of the lancet device of FIGS. 20-22, axial or longitudinal<br>
movement of shield body 50 toward rear cap 24, causes the retaining hub 90i to be displaced<br>
rearwardly toward rear cap 24, with fingers 82 of the carrier element 76 resting upon the cam<br>
elements 92i. Such rearward movement of retaining hub 90i causes the contact surfaces of<br>
the engagement cam surfaces of the internal contacts within rear cap 24 to engage and co-act<br>
with the corresponding contact surfaces 96i on the contact elements 94i of cam elements 92i.<br>
Such engagement and continued downward or distal movement of the internal contacts<br>
causes the cam elements 92i to pivot on or rotate about shafts 93i with respect to support<br>
members 91i. Due to the generally wedge-shaped profile of the contact elements 94i, the<br>
pivotal movement of cam elements 92i has the effect of further compressing drive spring 102<br>
by further "lifting" fingers 82, at least until the point where rear nub 86 on carrier element 76<br>
contacts the inner side of rear cap 24. At this point, continued axial of longitudinal<br>
displacement of shield body 50 toward rear cap 24 pivots cam elements 92i to a position<br>
where recess lOOi defined in the bottom side of cam elements 92i has rotated to a position<br>
generally aligned with fingers 82 at which point the interference engagement between fingers<br>
82 and cam elements 92i is released by such alignment. The biasing force of drive spring 102<br>
then propels lancet structure 70 downward away from the rear cap 24 axially through the<br>
housing and through shield body 50 axially through the annular opening defined by retaining<br>
hub 90i.<br>
[00103] Referring to FIGS. 23A-23D, a further variation or modification of the lancet<br>
device is generally illustrated in a further embodiment. In the embodiment of FIGS. 23 A-<br>
23D, a puncturing device in the form of lancet device 200 is shown. The lancet device 200<br>
generally includes a housing 211, a shield 213 received partially within and axially movable<br>
relative to the housing 211, and a skin puncturing assembly 215 (which may be similar to the<br>
lancet structure 70 discussed above) disposed within the housing 211. The housing 211 is<br>
preferably a generally tubular structure having a distal end 216 and a proximal end 218, and<br>
may include similar structure to the housing 12 discussed above in connection with FIGS. 1-<br><br>
18 including a main body 20 and a rear cap 24. Desirably, the housing 211 is open-ended at<br>
the distal and proximal ends 216,218. An end cap 240 may be provided at the proximal end<br>
216 of the housing 211 to close the proximal end 218 of the housing 211. Alternatively, the<br>
housing 211 may be formed to have a closed proximal end 218 instead of the end cap 240. In<br>
such an embodiment, the closed proximal end 218 of the housing 211 would be integrally<br>
formed with the remainder of the body of the housing 211 in this variation of the puncturing<br>
device 200. The skin puncturing assembly 215 may further include a protective tip guard 282<br>
connected to a carrier member 250. The tip guard 282 may be formed integrally with the<br>
body of the carrier member 250, and may include a notched connection with the carrier<br>
member 250 in a similar manner as with protective cover 120 described above.<br>
[00104] Flexure members 238 are formed or provided on a proximal end 244 of the shield<br>
213. The flexure members 238 define structure for retaining the lancet structure in an initial<br>
armed position retracted within the housing, acting in a similar manner as the pivotal lever<br>
element and the retaining hub of the embodiments previously described in connection with<br>
FIGS. 1-19. For example, projections 276 on the flexure members 238 extend inward so as<br>
to engage or coact with the carrier member 250 of the skin puncturing assembly 215. The<br>
projections 276 engage or extend into a circumferential recess 200 defined or formed in the<br>
carrier member 250. The recess 210 defines a circumferential edge 212, which is engaged by<br>
the projections 276 of the flexure members 238. The engagement edges 277 of the<br>
projections 276 in the lancet device 210 illustrated in FIGS. 23A-23D are formed or defined<br>
by a radially inward-extending tab 214 on each of the projections 276. Engagement edges<br>
277 act in a similar manner as shoulder 94 described above with reference to FIGS. 1-18,<br>
with the load represented by the skin puncturing assembly 215 resting on the engagement<br>
edges 277.<br>
[00105] The projections 276 maintain the carrier member 250, and thus the skin puncturing<br>
assembly 215, in the retracted position until released of engagement with the carrier member<br>
250 by axial displacement of the shield 213 into the housing 211. In the pre-actuated state of<br>
the lancet device 200, the biasing force of the drive spring 270 is restrained by the projections<br>
276 and by engagement of the distal end 242 of the shield 213 with an interfering structure<br>
provided at the distal end 216 of the housing 211. In particular, while the shield 213 is<br>
axially or longitudinally movable or displaceable into the housing 211, the shield 213 is<br>
. prevented from moving distally relative to the housing 211 by an edge 217 formed on the<br>
shield 213. The edge 217 is formed or defined by a portion 219 of the shield 213 having an<br>
increased wall thickness. The edge 217 coacts or engages with an internal lip 220 formed at<br><br>
the distal end 216 of the housing 211 to restrain the force of the drive spring 270. The<br>
engagement of the edge 217 with the lip 220 allows the flexure members 238 to maintain the<br>
carrier member 250 in the retracted position and restrain the force of the drive spring 270. In<br>
particular, in the pre-actuated state of the lancet device 200, the force of the drive spring 270<br>
is transmitted via the projections 276 to the body of the shield 213, which causes the edge<br>
217 on the shield 213 to engage the Up 220 and restrain the force of the drive spring 270.<br>
[00106] The flexure members 238 are adapted to be released of engagement with the<br>
carrier member 250 by one or more actuating members 222 (similar to the internal contact 46<br>
in the embodiment described above with reference to FIGS. 1-18). The actuating member<br>
222 may be formed integrally with the end cap 240, or may be formed separately therefrom<br>
and secured to the end cap 240 with, for example, an adhesive. The actuating member 222<br>
includes a tapered camming surface 224 (similar to engagement surface 47), which is adapted<br>
to coact or engage with the tapered camming surfaces 278 of the flexure members 238 for<br>
actuating the puncturing device 200. In particular, to actuate the puncturing device 200<br>
shown in FIGS. 23A-23D, the user, typically a medical practitioner, places the distal end 242<br>
of the shield 213 in contact with the body part where a blood sample is to be taken, and<br>
applies pressure in the direction of arrow 226 in FIGS. 23A-23D to cause the shield 213 to<br>
move proximally into the housing 211. The movement of the shield 213 into the housing 211<br>
causes the opposing camming surfaces 278, 224 on the flexure members 238 and actuating<br>
member 222, respectively, to engage and interact. As the shield 213 is displaced or moved<br>
into the housing 211, the flexure members 238 are flexed radially outward due to the<br>
interaction of the opposing camming surfaces 278, 224, as shown in FIGS. 23C and 23D.<br>
The flexure members 238 may be adapted or configured to bend or break once they are flexed<br>
radially outward a preset distance, angle of rotation, or amount. For example, the flexure<br>
members 238 may be formed with a weakened area 228, such as a score line, so that the<br>
flexure members 238 break when flexed radially outward a preset distance or degree of<br>
rotation. Moreover, weakened area 228 may act as a hinge in a similar manner as pivot hinge<br>
98 described above.<br>
[00107] During such movement of the flexure members 238, projections 276 tilt toward<br>
the rear end cap 240, thereby "lifting" or moving carrier member 250 toward rear cap 240<br>
and compressing or further compressing drive spring 240. Once the projections 276 on the<br>
flexure members 238 are released of engagement with the carrier member 250, the drive<br>
spring 270 is free to move the carrier member 250 from the retracted position to the<br>
puncturing position. The drive spring 270 preferably has sufficient stored energy to cause the *<br><br>
sharp distal tip 254 of the skin puncturing element 215 to pierce the skin of a person or<br>
animal once the flexure members 238 are released of engagement with the carrier member<br>
250.<br>
[00108] As the carrier member 250 moves distally and reaches the puncturing position<br>
wherein the sharp distal tip 254 of the skin puncturing element 215 is fully exposed, a<br>
retraction spring 274 is compressed between the carrier member 250 and the distal end 242 of<br>
the shield 213 in a similar manner as retraction spring 110 discussed above with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1-18. The compression of the retraction spring 274 provides a return or retraction<br>
force that acts on the carrier member 250 to move the carrier member 250 in a return,<br>
proximal, or retraction direction in the housing 211, which returns or retracts the skin<br>
pvmcturing element 215 and the sharp distal tip 254 thereof fully into the housing 211 and<br>
shield 213. The retraction spring 274 thereafter prevents the reemergence of the skin<br>
puncturing element 215 from the housing 211 and shield 213.<br>
[00109] While specific embodiments of the lancet device have been described, those<br>
