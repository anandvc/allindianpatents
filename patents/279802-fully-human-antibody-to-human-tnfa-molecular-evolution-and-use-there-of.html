FULLY HUMAN ANTIBODY TO HUMAN TNF α, MOLECULAR EVOLUTION                               AND USE THEREOF<br>
APPLICANT:<br>
Danyang Zhengyuan Biotech Co. Ltd.<br>
Having address: Industrial Park for Overseas Chinese Students, Bawei Rd., Danyang Economic Development Zone, Danyang City, Jiangsu 212300. China<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to biotechnology, in particular to anti human TNFα monoclonal antibodies, their improvement via molecular evolution, and their clinical application after<br>
improvement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
About Autoimmune Diseases<br>
Autoimmune diseases represented by Rheumatoid arthritis are serious diseases that affect human health worldwide. Until bio-antagonists such as TNFa Receptor Inhibitor/Fc protein, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, were introduced into clinical application, the first line treatment for autoimmune diseases had been COX2 inhibitors, such as Fosamax abroad, and some Chinese medicines in China. All these chemicals are far from good in efficacy or safety or both. After monoclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody like products approval by FDA from 1997, several TNFa bioblockers were approved to be used in autoimmune disease therapy and gained great success, and resulted in fierce competition in development of TNFa bioinhibitors all over the world. Up to now, at least five TNFa bioinhibitors have been introduced into the market such as Enbrel, Remicade, Humira, Simponi and Cimzia for Rheumatoid, and Amivive, Raptiva, Enbrel for Psoriasis. Among them, Enbrel, Remicade and Humira, etc, had been tested for clinical treatment of other autoimmune diseases.<br>
Physiological Functions of TNFa<br>
TNFa is a major inflammatory cytokine that was first identified for its ability to induce rapid hemorrhagic necrosis of experimental cancers. Beside this it has multiple functions including regulatory role in inflammation addressed in later research. It was shown that its precursor consists of 233 amino acids including a 76 amino acid peptide at N- end, which is not a signal peptide but an anchor holding the matured secretory molecules onto the cell membrane. The matured mRNA molecule coding this precursor is 1.7kb in length produced mainly in mononuclear phagocyte. Matured TNFa is composed of 157 amino acids linked together by two disulfide bonds, and has not glycosylation site, TNFa has different functions to different cells, such as killing cells, accelerating or suppressing cell<br>
 <br>
growth. It can suppress hematopotesis thereby causing red cell reduction and resulting in activation of macrophagocyte and killing function, enhancing macrophagocyte's immune response and neutrophilic granulocyte accumulation around inflammatory sites. It can inhibit B cell response to EBV and inhibit B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. It can cause tumor hemorrhagic necrosis via affecting tumor vessels resulting in cancer growth inhibition, and improve anti cancer ability of human body by enhancing immunoreaction. In addition, this factor has important physiological functions in liver, bone, muscle, blood vessel and others.<br>
TNFa has close relationship with autoimmune diseases. TNFα over expression in diseased sites is the key cause of swell and pain, and TNFa is the closest factor in TNF family related to autoimmune diseases.<br>
It was found that TNFα overexpression has close relationship with occurrence and development of multiple inflammatory diseases, including but not limited to Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriasis vulgaris, Systemic Lupus erythematosus, Ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis. Therefore, any antagonist that down-regulate TNFa level, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors, were effective in the treatment of the above diseases. There were several monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors successfully applied in autoimmune disease treatment such as the famous products Enbrel, Remicade and Humira. Extensive clinical application showed that they were of prominent efficacy with high safety for various autoimmune diseases. These results indicated that TNFa was a very ideal target for autoimmune disease treatment.<br>
Rheumatoid arithritis (shortly RA) is a very common autoimmune disease with swollen joint swell and other joint problems, and about 20% of the patients would become joint or bone injured, or even disabled. This will lead to not only economic problems to the family and society, but also very bad daily life to the patients.<br>
Psoriasis is another common autoimmune disease that causes skin redness and irritation. Skin cells grow deep in the skin and normally rise to the surface about once a month. In persons with Psoriasis, this process is too fast so that dead skin cells build up on the skin surface leading to inflammation, swell, and thick and red skin with flaky, silver-white patches or even serious festers. These symptoms mostly appear on scalp, knees, elbows and trunk, and may affect people of any age, any nationality and both sexes equally. The serous fester will not only leave the patients a lot of trouble for daily therapy and<br>
 <br>
prognosis, but also let the patients bear heavy psychological burden because it is queasy and recognized by common people as an infectious disease so that they are excluded from the surrounding population. This disorder gives a lot of difficulties for daily life and mentality to the patients. If appropriate treatment is not applied in time, psoriasis will develop into psoriasis arthritis and lead to disabled.<br>
Autoimmune diseases with the same pathogenesis include Ankylosing apondylitis (AS). AS patients exhibit spondyle joints injured, which often leads to not only movement restriction, disabled, or even complete loss of self-care ability in daily life, but also to serious physical torture.<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies, Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies and Their Development<br>
In the last two decades, therapeutic monoclonal antibody experienced a great progress and achievement. There have been several heavyweight products successfully developed and marketed. Among them, there have been at least Enbrel, Humira and Remicade targeting to TNFα and Rituxan targeting to CD20. All these therapeutic monoclonal antibodies represented prominent curative effect, and made tremendous success in both technology and business so that they rapidly become into first-line therapy. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies gained an unprecedented s uccess in treatment of cancers, some infectious diseases and so on. Because of their prominent curative effect and the huge market demand created by this, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are still under extensive development.<br>
Presently, the most popular method to obtain monoclonal antibodies is hybridoma technology, in which rodents such as mice and rabbits, poultry such as chicken and primates such as macaques and apes, human beings and so on are involved. In addition, more and more studies on camel antibody have been reported, and humanized mice have been taken as a powerful tool in novel therapeutic monoclonal antibody development.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies used in therapy requires many, among them the interconnected factors such as affinity, neutralization ability, specificity and side-effects are the main considerations Generally speaking, a higher affinity will lead to lower effective dosage and further result in lower manufacturing cost and less side-effects. A higher specificity will lower the effects on other components in vivo, and further result in less side effects. Hence, it is a very important aspect to obtain monoclonal antibodies with high affinity. At<br>
 <br>
the same time, not all current methods can produce monoclonal antibodies that meet the pharmaceutical requirements in both affinity and neutralization ability.<br>
It is not easy to obtain a monoclonal antibody that is good enough for therapy although there have been many methods to produce monoclonal antibodies. In many cases, limitations in specificity, neutralization ability, affinity and/or others can be an obstacle for a monoclonal antibody to be successfully used in clinical therapy,<br>
Another important factor that determines a monoclonal antibody's usability in clinical therapy is whether it can be easily manufactured. This requires that the said monoclonal antibody can be manufactured in large scale with low cost. The most important indicator for this is the amount of the product in a liter media, this is normally called specific productivity.<br>
In the last two decades, great success was achieved with recombinant therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. New products emerged in endlessly. Recombinant therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have became in therapeutic medicines the field that developed most rapidly, and have drawn great attention from the industry. Governments and pharmaceutical companies invested actively at a large scale to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibody medicines. However, many difficulties came forth while therapeutic monoclonal antibody technology developed rapidly. Outstanding ones of them include that recombinant mammalian cells must be used for their production, and their dosages are massive. This leads to high cost that patients could not bear. Therefore, how to reduce the costs while ensuring their curative effect becomes a key problem for monoclonal antibody medicine development.<br>
The dramatic selling increases of marketed monoclonal antibody medicines and durative introduction of more and more new products into market challenge manufacturers' productivity.<br>
TNFa Antagonists and their Clinical Applications<br>
As mentioned above, TNFa is a key factor that leads to swell and pain in joints of RA patients. On the other hand, it is also the key mediator in septic shock. Ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis as indicated in many studies. The increased TNFa level in the serum of septic shock and RA patients is an indicator of the increased mortality and disability rate. Passive input of TNFa antagonists can prevent septic shock<br>
 <br>
and tissue lesion caused by LPS and bacteria infection. Clinical application of TNFα monoclonal antibodies or its receptors shows notable curative effect for septic shock, Ankylosing spondylitis, Psoriasis and Rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Up to now, there are multiple kinds of monoclonal antibodies and receptor-Fc fusion proteins against human TNFα that have been successfully applied in clinic to the above indications, and gained a great success in industrialization.<br>
Humira is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody developed by Abbot targeting human TNFα, which was approved by FDA in 2002. Its first approved indication was RA. Because of its prominent efficacy, the global year sale reached as high as 2 billion US dollars in 2006. Its variable regions and the corresponding coding DNA sequences were from a fully human antibody library constructed by CAT, and its Fc coding region was from human IgGl. It can be seen from this that the variable regions of this product were not directly from human being but from an antibody library derived from human B cells.<br>
The present invention uses the lymphocytes separated from peripheral blood of a RA patient as the starting material, antibody library technology as the core to obtain Fab format molecules of ful human antibodies being able to neutralize human TNFa after a serial panning. Molecular evolution technology is used to improve or alter the affinity and specificity of the said molecules to meet requirements for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The full length molecules with biologic activity are successfully expressed in a CHO cell line. Therefore, the amino acid sequences and their corresponding DNA sequences in this invention are from human being. The affinity of the anti human TNFa monoclonal antibodies in this invention is notably higher than Humira, and the clinically effective dosages are significantly reduced.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An object of this invention is to disclose an anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody and its corresponding coding DNA sequences.<br>
Another object of this invention is to disclose possible pharmaceutical applications of the said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody.<br>
One aspect of this invention discloses an anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody the light chain amino acid sequence of which is set forth in SEQ ID NO:8, and the heavy chain<br>
 <br>
amino acid sequence of which is set forth in SEQ ID NO:9 or SEQ ID NO: 10. Preferably, the anti human TNFa full length heavy chain amino acid sequence comprise the poly peptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 16 or SEQ ID NO: 18. The above said SEQ ID NO:8 is a light chain variable region amino acid sequence.<br>
Another aspect of this invention discloses a polynucleotide coding the light chain of the above said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody. More preferably, this polynucleotide comprises SEQ ID NO:5.<br>
The third aspect of this invention discloses a polynucleotide coding the full length heavy chain of the above said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody. More preferably, this polynucleotide comprises SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 17.<br>
The forth aspect of this invention discloses the Fab format of the above said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody.<br>
The fifth aspect of this invention discloses the application of the above said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody or its Fab format in manufacturing the formulation used for treatment of inflammation related to TNFa, such as manufacturing a medicine applicable to treat RA. The Dosage and method of using the said anti human TNFa monoclonal antibody or its Fab format thereof could be determined with reference to the conventional methods for existing TNFa antibodies.<br>
Advantages and Benefits<br>
Although existing anti TNFa monoclonal antibody like medicines are deemed to have better efficacy compared with any other medicines, they have still obvious disadvantages. Firstly, they are mainly expressed and purified by the aid of mammalian cell lines, in which the gene expression level was relatively low and the production capacity is far from ideal to meet the market requirement. This problem still exists even though the volume of a single bioreactor is over 20000 liters as constructed with 500 million US dollars by Amgen.Secondly, the high cost rejects a large part of patients outside of treatment. As estimated, it would cost 11400, 14200 and 16776 US dollars a year for a patient to treat RA using Enbrel, Remicade and Humira respectively. At the same time, the treatment would last for a long period. Thirdly, these antibodies contain Fc fragment that (it) is of complement fixation, ADCC and other bioactivities, so that their application in vivo could lead to apoptosis of the cells that express TNFa. And fourthly, products like Remicade are<br>
 <br>
human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibodies, of whose components one-third is mouse-homologous. This would trigger HAMA reaction to these chimeric structures in more than 10% patients who applied this drug continually and this would in turn lower their efficacy and induce serious adverse reactions. The coming product CDP870, a PEGylated humanized anti human TNFa Fab format in whose mouse-homologous is as low as 10%, is still of immunogenicity.<br>
Fully human monoclonal antibodies against human TNFa are obtained in the present invention via human-human hybridoma technology. Primary physical, chemical and biological analysis shows that these, monoclonal antibodies have high affinity to TNFa, and ability to neutralize effectively the killing effect of TNFa on the cell line L929 in vitro. Firstly, the obtained monoclonal antibodies are of the lowest immunogenicity on human body as their amino acid sequences are completely identical to monoclonal antibodies produced by and in a human body. Secondly, Escherichia coli could be used to manufacture their Fab format so that the costs would be reduced dramatically, and more importantly, all side effects caused by complement fixation and ADCC are banished. Thirdly, PEGylation technology is used to modify the surface of the said Fab antibodies to reduce the possibility phagocytosed by reticuloendothelial system so that their detention time in blood circulation system is dramatically extended. This helps to accomplish the goal of sustained release of the said Fab molecules. This solves the problem of half-life shortage in vivo of small Fab molecule so that it is more suitable to be used in vivo while its biological activity is sustained. Compared with the existing monoclonal antibody medicines, the molecules described in this invention are able to extend dramatically dosing intervals. This will further lighten not only a patient's economic burden, but his/her pain caused by injection and manpower loss.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention employs the following experimental strategy:<br>
Isolation of human B cells secreting anti human TNFa antibodies:<br>
Leukocytes are isolated from peripheral blood of RA patients using Lymphocyte Isolation Solution and then the positive cells are identified by ELISA after being cultured.<br>
Isolation of mRNA coding for antibodies specific to human TNFa<br>
Total RNA is isolated from the above said positive leukocytes and then cDNA is synthesized by the aid of reverse transcription. Then amplify the coding sequences of variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibodies to human TNFa by PCR according to SE. Dohmen's method (Journal of Immunological Methods 298 (2005) 9 -20. Production of recombinant Ig molecules from antigen-selected single B cells and restricted usage of Ig-gene segments by anti-D antibodies), clone and sequence the obtained coding sequences of the variable regions of both heavy and light chains, and the deduced amino acid sequences of them can be obtained from the sequencing results.<br>
1.	The full length coding sequences for both heavy and light chains are identified, and inserted into the expression carrier pcDNA3.1(+) (from Invitrogen). The expression carrier is then used to co-rransfect CHO cells to express anti human TNFa antibodies. MTX selection is carried out to increase antibody expression level.<br>
2.	The antagonistic function of anti human TNFa antibodies, Fab and Fab-PEG molecules is studied, and compared with that of the existing anti human TNFa antibody, Humira.<br>
The invention would be further described with reference to the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims. Experimental methods and reagents not described in detail in the following examples can be carried out or prepared based on conventional conditions as described in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, or manufacturer's manuals.<br>
Example 1 - Isolation of leukocytes secreting anti human TNFa antibodies<br>
5ml peripheral blood from an active RA patient is used to isolate leukocytes by the aid of<br>
 <br>
Lymphocyte Isolation Solution, and positive clones are identified based on ELISA assay after the isolated cells cultured.<br>
1.  Blood Samples and Primary Screening for TNFa-Binding Positives<br>
In order to isolate human B cells secreting anti human TNFa antibodies, recombinant human TNFa (from Shanghai Sino Biotechnology Co.) is used to coat 96-well plates, 250ng each well, kept over night before blocking for 2 hours at room temperature with 5% defatted milk dissolved in PBS at pH7.2, washed once with PBS, incubated for 1 hour at Room Temperature (RT), lOOulserum from different patients be added in each well respectively. Then, the plates are kept for one hour at RT after peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG conjugate is added. After at least 5 washes, TMD or other equivalent chromogenic reagents are added and kept for 20 minutes at RT or 37°C. Stop solution is added. The reaction should keep for at least 10 minutes after adding the chromogenic reagent before 50ul lN sulphuric acid solution is added to stop the reactions. Then read the optical absorbance at 450nm. The positive blood samples with high OD value are selected as candidates.<br>
2. Isolation of Leukocytes from Positive Peripheral Blood Samples<br>
lOxRed Cell Lysing Solution is prepared according to the following recipe and procedure:<br>
80g NH4CI, 1Og KHCO3 and 3.7g Na4EDTA are dissolved in 800ml ddH20: adjust the pH to 7.2- 7.4 by dropping IN HC1 or IN NaOH, and add ddH20 to the final volume of 1000ml. Then, leukocytes are isolated from the blood samples according to the following procedure.<br>
(1)	Anti-coagulated blood samples are spinned at 400~500xg for 5 minutes, aspirate supernatant completely.<br>
(2)	I xRed Cell Lysing Solution is added to the tubes by 6 to 10 volumes of the cell pellet. The pellet is resuspended by repeatedly gentle pipette, and lysing kept for 2 minutes. For example, if the pellet volume is 1ml, 6 to 10 ml Red Cell Lysing Solution should be added. This step can be carried out at RT or 4°C. Please note: Lysing for 1 to 2 minutes should be enough for mouse blood, but it should be 4 to 5 minutes for human blood. More preferably, the tube is shaken or tapped occasionally to accelerate lysing.<br>
 <br>
(3)	Spinning is done at 400~500xg for 5 minutes, the supernatant is decanted completely. Spinning done at 4Q could be better.<br>
(4)	If lysing is found incomplete, the above lysing step could be repeated once or twice.  Generally,  trace amount red  cell  leftover would  not affect the subsequent<br>
procedure.<br>
(5)	Washing for 1 or 2 times: appropriate PBS, HBSS, Physiological Saline or<br>
medium without serum is added to resuspend the pellet. Spin at 400~500xg for 2-3<br>
minutes, the supernatant is decanted completely. This washing step can be repeated once,<br>
twice in total. Generally, the amount of washing buffer in each wash should be at least 5<br>
times of the volume of the pellet. The obtained pellet after spinning at 4 °C is purified<br>
leukocytes. TriZol is added to the cell pellet to isolate total RNA according to<br>
manufacturer's manual, or stored at -80 °C for later use,<br>
1.	mRNA isolation<br>
(1)	TriZol (from Invitrogen, Cat.No.12183-555) is used to isolate total RNA according to manufacturer's manual, the obtained total RNA samples are stored at -80 °C for later use.<br>
(2)	Dynabeads® mRNA Purification Kit (from Invitrogen, Cat.no.610.06) is used to purify mRNA according to manufacturer's manual, the obtained mRNA samples are used to synthesis cDNA immediately, or stored at -80 °C for later use.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of Anti human TNFa Antibody Genes<br>

Panning Procedure<br>
Recombinant human TNFa is used as antigen to pan the above antibody library for Fab<br>
 <br>
molecules with high affinity, the detailed procedure is described as follows.<br>
1.	1ml resuscitated bacteria harboring the antibody library plasmids is added into 14ml<br>
fresh LB medium in a 50ml triangle flask, incubated with vigorous shaking for 16 hours at<br>
37 °C.<br>
2.	The supernatant is transferred to a sterilized 50ml centrifuge tube after spinning at 12000RPM for 10minut.es, stored for later use. The titer should be not less than 2x1011.<br>
3.	A 25-ml cell culture bottle is coated with purified recombinant human TNFa by conventional method.<br>
4.	Not less than 3x1010 phage particles are added in a coated cell culture bottle, incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C.<br>
5.	The liquid is completely decanted from the bottle, and the bottle is washed 10 times with 10ml PBS containing l%Tween-20 each time.<br>
6.	Iml E. coli bacterial strain TGI cells at log phase are added, and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for 16 hours.<br>
7.	The steps from 2 to 6 are repeated four times.<br>
8.	The above cell suspensions are diluted to lOOOOOcells/ml, then, spreaded onto 1.5% agar plates that contain 0. ] % ampicillin.<br>
9.	The colonies from the plate are inoculated into wells of 96 deep-well plates, a single colony each well. 960 colonies should be inoculated in ten 96 deep-well plates.<br>
10.	The above plates are spinned for 20 minutes at 5000RPM. then the supernatant is transferred to new 96 deep well plates, and stored at 4°C for later use.<br>
11.	Ten new 96-well plates are coated with lOul recombinant human TNFa (lOug/rnl) in each well, then the stored supernatants are added individually with lOul each well, and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, then 20 washes with PBS containing 1% Tween-20 are carried out,<br>
12.	lul HRP-Iabeied goat anti M13 monoclonal antibody is added and mixed well, incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes before 10 washes with PBS containing 1% Tween-20 are carried out.<br>
!3. 200ul PBS containing 0.025% DAB and 1 ull% H202 is added and incubated for 20 minutes to develop the color reaction before reading the data at 595nm.<br>
 <br>
14. Wells with high readings are identified after analysis. These clones correspond to variable fragments with high affinities.<br>
486 positive clones are identified from the above said antibody library, and 4 clones with the highest readings are selected, and their affinities are tested.<br>
Affinity assay is carried out according to Scatchard method (Munson et al, 1980, Anal. BioChem., 107:220). The results show that affinities of 4B3, 5F8, 5G4 and 7E2 are as high as 5.17x10~7, 5.21 x10-8, 7.16&gt;
Molecular Evolution<br>
It is shown in the above results that the affinities of the above clones 5F8 and 5G4 are as high as nanomolar level. For further improvement of their affinities, a sub-library harboring saturated random mutations at CDR3 (ndegapydh) of the 5F8 heavy chain is constructed according to conventional mutation method. From four cycles of panning, in which Humira Fab is used as positive control, 876 positive clones are panned out, and six of them have an affinity better than 10-10 level, the clones include 7B4, 2H7, 4D3, 6F5, 3C9 and 3H6. Among these, 7B4 and 2H7 have affinities as high as 10-12 level, equal or even higher than that of Humira Fab, Neutralization ability of these six clones will be assayed in the subsequent experiments.<br>
Example 3 - Studies on the Neutralization Ability of the Fab Molecules Specific to Human TNFa<br>
The neutralization abilities of the Fab proteins purified from the above clones are assayed according to the following procedure.<br>
1.	L929 cells are cultured to log phase, then digested with Trypsin to separate the ceils before diluted to 2x105cells/ml with cell culture medium.<br>
2.	lOOul of the above cell suspensions are transferred to each well of four 96-well plates, incubated in 5% C02 for 24 hours at 37 DC in a CO2 incubator.<br>
3.	The Fab samples to be measured are diluted with medium containing l~2mg/ml Actinomycin D and 0.00lug/ml TNFa reference material (from Shanghai Sino Biotechnology Co.) to the final concentrations of lOmg/ml, l.Omg/ml, O.lmg/mLO.Olmg/ml, 0.001 mg/ml, O.OOOlmg/ml and O.OOOOlmg/ml. The medium containing l~2mg/ml Actinomycin D is used as the negative control and the medium with high dosage of TNFa (2mg/m) as the positive control.<br>
 <br>
4.	Triplicates (lOOul each well) of the diluted samples at different concentrations, positive and negative controls are aliquotted into a 96-Well plate.<br>
5.	The plate is incubated in 5% CO2 for 24 hours at 37 °C or longer. The culturing time should be determined according to the time that all cells in positive control wells get dead.<br>
6.	The plates are read to obtain the optical density data after MTT reaction, then a data-based sketch is drawn (see Fig.3).<br>
It is shown in the data that neutralization abilities of the clones 7B4 and 2H7 are obviously higher than that of Humira-Fab, and other clones are roughly equal to or a little bit lower than that of Humira Fab format.<br>
