POLYMER MATERIAL HAVING POLYROTAXANE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a material comprising polyrotaxane, and a method for producing the material.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, there are various products containing a crosslinked polymer such as contact lenses, paints and varnishes, and the like.  However, in the crosslinked polymer, the distance from a crosslinked point to the next crosslinked point is not uniform; thus, when strain is applied to the crosslinked polymer, a site of a shorter distance between crosslinked points is broken preferentially, causing non-uniform breaking.  For example, in the case of a paint or varnish, strain corresponds to force generated by drying after painting, and there is a problem of occurrence of crack on an applied surface after drying.  In the case of a contact lens, there is a possibility of application of strain to the lens in use, generating a problem of occurrence of scratch on a lens surface.<br>
On the other hand, Patent Document 1 discloses a crosslinked polyrotaxane, which is formed by crosslinking polyrotaxanes , each of which is comprised of pseudopolyrotaxane , which comprises a linear molecule (axis) and cyclic molecules (rota) in which the linear molecule is included in cavities of<br><br>
cyclic molecules in a skewered manner, and capping groups, each of which locates at each end of the pseudopolyrotaxane (each end of the linear molecule) in order to prevent the dissociation of the cyclic molecules.  The crosslinked polyrotaxane has viscoelasticity generated by the movement of a cyclic molecule. Thus, even if strain is applied to the crosslinked polyrotaxane, the strain is dispersed uniformly in the crosslinked polyrotaxane by this action.  Therefore, crack or scratch is not generated, differing from the crosslinked polymer .  However , in a case where a material is constituted only of crosslinked polyrotaxane, there occurs a problem of relatively high cost. Further, only with the crosslinked polyrotaxane, a property required for a material to be applied is not obtained in some cases. Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 3475252.<br>

Thus, when force (tension and/or stress) is loaded on the material, the material is capable of expansion and contraction by the movement of the cyclic molecule.<br>
The material according to the present invention will be illustrated using Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a material 1 of the present invention. The material 1 of the present invention comprises a polymer 3 and polyrotaxane 5 . The polyrotaxane 5 has a linear molecule 6, a cyclic molecule 7 and a capping group 8. The polymer 3 and polymer 3 ' and the polyrotaxane 5 are bound through the cyclic molecule 7. When stress of deformation along an arrow direction is loaded on the material 1 as shown in Fig. 1(a), the material 1 can adopt a configuration as shown in Fig. 1 (b) . That is, since the cyclic molecule 7 can move along the linear molecule 6 (in other words,<br><br>
the linear molecule can move in the cyclic molecule), stress of deformation can be absorbed in the material. On the other hand, in the case of a conventional material having no polyrotaxane, although not shown in a drawing, when stress of deformation is loaded, the stress cannot be absorbed in the material, leading to cut of a bond between polymers.<br>
In the material of the present invention, the polyrotaxane and the polymer are bound or crosslinked.  Polymers may be mutually crosslinked or, polyrotaxanes may be mutually crosslinked.  More specifically, the present invention can provide i) a material in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are bound or crosslinked, and polymers are crosslinked and polyrotaxanes are crosslinked; ii) a material in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are bound or crosslinked, and the polyrotaxanes are crosslinked, while polymers are not crosslinked; iii) a material in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are bound or crosslinked, and the polymers are crosslinked, while the polyrotaxanes are not crosslinked; and iv) a material in which the polyrotaxane and the polymer are bound or crosslinked, while polymers are not crosslinked and polyrotaxanes are not crosslinked.  In any case of i) to iv) , a polymer forms a crosslinked polymer through binding or crosslinking with polyrotaxane, or through mutual crosslinking of polymers.<br>
The presence of polyrotaxane in a material according to the present invention can provide expansion and contraction of the material as described above .  Accordingly, polyrotaxane may<br><br>
be present in the material according to the present invention. The amount of polyrotaxane in a material depends on a nature required for the material. For example, the weight ratio of the polyrotaxane to the polymer ( (polyrotaxane) / (polymer) ) may be 1/1000 or more , namely, polyrotaxane is present in a proportion of 1 or more based on 1000 of a polymer.<br>

molecules included in a skeweredmanner, and the amount at maximum is normalized to be 1.<br>
When the inclusion amount of a cyclic molecule is near the maximum value, there occurs a tendency that the moving distance of a cyclic molecule along a linear molecule is limited. When the moving distance is limited, a tendency of limitation of the degree of expansion and contraction of a material occurs undesirably.<br>
The maximum inclusion amount of a cyclic molecule can be determined depending on the length of a linear molecule and the thickness of a cyclic molecule. For example, when the linear molecule is polyethylene glycol and the cyclic molecule is an a-cyclodextrin molecule, the maximum inclusion amount is measured empirically (see, Macromolecules 1993, 26, 5698-5703, whole contents of which is incorporated herein).<br>

Example 1:<br><preparation of polyrotaxane><br>
PEG»<br><br>
10 g of PEG (molecular weight: 35, 000) , 100 mg of TEMPO (2,2,6, 6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy radical) and 1 g of sodium bromide were dissolved in 100 ml of water.  To the mixture was added 5 ml of a commercially available aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (effective chlorine concentration: approx. 5%) , and reacted with stirring at room temperature .  Immediately after adding sodium hypochlorite, pH of the reaction mixture was rapidly decreased with the progress of the reaction, and was adjusted by adding IN NaOH so that pH of the reaction mixture was preferably kept at 10 to 11.  Decrease of pH became scarcely observable within almost 3 minutes , and then the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes .  The reaction was quenched by adding ethanol with an amount of up to 5 ml.  Ingredients other than inorganic salts were extracted with 50 ml of methylene chloride three times, and methylene chloride was removed with an evaporator .  The residue was dissolved in 250 ml of hot ethanol, and allowed to stand in a freezer at -4°C overnight to precipitate a PEG-carboxylic acid, in which each end of the PEG was substituted with carboxylic acid (-COOH) .  The precipitated PEG-carboxylic acid was collected by centrifugation.  The collected PEG-carboxylic acid was subjected to the procedure consisting of dissolving in hot ethanol, precipitating and centrifuging, for several times , and finally dried in vacuum, to give a purified PEG-carboxylic acid.  Yield was 95% or more.  A degree of carboxylation was 95% or more.<br><br>

Then, to the mixture was added 50 ml of methanol.  The mixture was stirred and centrifuged.  Then, the supernatant was discarded. Further, to the resulting mixture 100 ml of mixture of DMF/methanol = 1:1, and the washing with the DMF/methanol mixture was repeated twice, followed by washing with 100 ml of methanol and centrifuging twice.  The resultant precipitate was dried in vacuum, dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dropped into 700 ml of water, and thereby a polyrotaxane was precipitated.  The precipitated polyrotaxane was collected by centrifugation.  The collected polyrotaxane was treated with the similar re-precipitation step, to obtain 9 g of a purified polyrotaxane.  NMR measurement of the resulting polyrotaxane<br><br>
showed that a molar ratio of CD to PEG monomer was 11 : 100 (degree of inclusion: 22%) .<br>&gt;<br>
5. 0 g of the polyrotaxane as prepared above was dissolved in 100 ml of dehydrated DMSO.

To 0 .5 ml of the collagen solution was added 0 . 5 ml of the methylated polyrotaxane solution, and mixed. To the resulting mixture was added 10 µL of DVS, and then allowed to stand at temperature of 25°C for 20 hours, to obtain a gelated body of a mixture of collagen and the methylated polyrotaxane (Weight ratio of collagen to the methylated polyrotaxane = 1 : 1) .<br>
Example 9:<br><preparation of the material according to present invention> Collagen was dissolved in a 0.03N NaOH aqueous solution, to prepare 1. 0 ml of a 2 wt % collagen solution.
