				<td>Process for the Preparation of Substituted Cvanophenoxy-Pyrimidinyloxy-phenyl<br>
Acrylate Derivatives<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of chemical synthesis, particularly to improved processes for synthesizing substituted cyanophenoxy-pyrimidinyloxy-phenyl acrylate derivatives.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the field of industrial chemical synthesis, the improvement of the yield and selectivity of chemical processes bears considerable impact on the industry. Particularly, the focus in said improvements is on lowering costs, simplifying unit operations and environmental considerations. These three factors are particularly important in the field of agrochemicals where the volume of chemicals is large and the marginal profit is relatively small.<br>
Of the many agrochemical compounds which are synthesized by multi-stage<br>
synthesis,	methyl	(£)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-<br>
methoxyacrylate (chemical common name: azoxystrobin), particularly drew the attention of the present inventors. Azoxystrobin, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,395,837, is a plant protection fungicide with protectant, curative, eradicant, translaminar and systemic properties. The preparation of azoxystrobin as described in Example 3 of U.S. 5,395,837 involves an aromatic substitution reaction between 2-cyanophenol and (E)-Methyl 2-[2-(6-chlorpyridimin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate also known as (E)-Methyl -2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)-phenyl]-3-methoxyacrylate, at temperatures at 95° to 100°C in DMF in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of potassium carbonate and a catalytic amount of copper(I) chloride. The reported yield of azoxystrobin is 65% wherein the product was found to have a melting point of 110°C -111°C, indicating a final product of relatively low purity, which subsequently required further purification. It has been suggested that reactions of 2-cyanophenol or other isomers of cyanophenol or phenols in general under conditions of temperatures of about 90°C and above, in the presence of basic reagents which can promote the formation of phenolate salts, may cause polymerization and the formation of tars. This clearly is a highly undesirable side effect.<br><br>
Accordingly there is an ongoing and long felt need for a process for aromatic substitution reactions in the presence phenols with improved yield and selectivity.<br>
Thus, it is the objective of the present invention to provide a process for reacting phenols under basic conditions in which me yield and selectivity is improved.<br>
Other objectives of the invention shall become apparent as the description proceeds.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for reacting between a phenol derivative and an aromatic substrate under phenolate forming conditions comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	reacting a phenol derivative with a base in a polar organic solvent to obtain a phenolate salt, wherein water is removed from the reaction mixture during the reaction.<br>
b)	adding the aromatic substrate to the reaction mixture obtained in step (a),<br>
c)	heating the reaction mixture of step (b) to a temperature in the range of 80° to 130°C,preferebly, 90-100°C for 2 to 7 hours to obtain a phenoxy substituted aromatic substrate,<br>
d)	removing the solvent from the mixture of step (c) and further isolating and purifying the phenoxy substituted aromatic substrate.<br>
Optionally, the removal of water during step (a) is in conjunction with partial removal of the organic solvent.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following description is illustrative of embodiments of the invention. The following description is not to be construed as limiting, it being understood that the skilled person may carry out many obvious variations to the invention. Throughout the specification the terms "phenols" and "phenol derivative" include phenol and mono and poly-substituted phenols, including 2-cyanophenol and other cyanophenol isomers.<br><br>
The present invention provides a process for reacting between a phenol derivative and an aromatic substrate under phenolate forming conditions wherein the formation of polymeric by-products and tars are minimized. In rninimizing said by-products and tars formation, the present process provides improved yields together with facilitation of product separation and purification. The present process provides yields of 90% and greater, wherein said yield is calculated on the basis of the aromatic substrate. It has been surprisingly found that generating the phenolate salt separately and subsequently reacting said phenolate salt with the aromatic substrate, prevents the formation of undesirable byproducts and tars.<br>

According to a specific embodiment of the invention, the phenolate salt is formed via partial removal of solvent with water under reduced pressure conditions.<br>
b)	adding the aromatic substrate to the reaction mixture obtained in step (a).<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention said aromatic substrate may be added together with a polar organic solvent selected from the afore-mentioned group of solvents. The aromatic substrate is added in an amount such that the mole ratio between the phenol derivative and aromatic substrate is between 1: 0.8 and 1:1<br>
In yet a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the aromatic substrate is selected from among mono and poly-substituted pyridine, pyrimidine and phenyl groups. Preferably, at least mono-halo substituted and more preferably chloro-pyrimidine derivatives.<br>
c)	heating the reaction mixture of step (b) to a temperature in the range of 80° to 130°C, preferably about 100°C for 2 to 7 hours, preferably about 5 hours to obtain a phenoxy substituted aromatic substrate,<br>
d)	removing the solvent from the mixture of step (c) and further isolating and purifying the phenoxy substituted aromatic substrate.<br>
The operations of step (d) can be carried out according to methods known to the skilled artisan. Said methods include; solvent removal by distillation wherein said distillation may be carried out under reduced pressure conditions, separation and purification by washing, extraction and crystallization.<br>
According to a specific preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of methyl (E)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate (azoxystrobin) comprising of the following steps:<br>

temperature between 60°C to 80°C , preferably between 60°C to 70°C for about 1 hour, while removing the water which is formed during the reaction via distillation with the solvent under reduced pressure, preferably about 20-30mbar. The mole ratio between 2-cyanophenol and alkali metal hydroxide is between 1:1 and 1:1.5. b) adding the aromatic substrate which is (E)-Methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyridimin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate (Compound of formula (I) to the reaction mixture obtained in step (a). Optionally. Compound (I) is added to the reaction mixture as a solution in DMAA.<br><br>
c)	heating the reaction mixture of step (b) to a temperature in the range of 80° to 130°C, preferably 90°C to 100°C for 2 to 7 hours, preferably 4 to 6 hours to obtain azoxystrobin,<br>
d)	removing the solvent from the mixture of step (c) by distillation under reduced pressure; and further washing and extracting the reaction mixture with a non-polar organic solvent, non-limiting examples being toluene, xylene, at least C4 acetate esters, preferably, butylacetate and adding water to obtain an organic and aqueous phase, thereafter discarding the aqueous phase and crystallizing the azoxystrobin from the organic phase by cooling the organic solvent, filtering the precipitated solid and rinsing thereafter with an alcohol, preferably methanol to obtain azoxystrobin with purity of 98%-99%.<br>
In yet a further specific embodiment of the present invention azoxystrobin is prepared according to the following process:<br><br>

Half the amount of DMAA containing water traces was distilled at vacuum 20mbar/60-65°C and the mixture was kept at vacuum 20mbar/ room temperature for lh. The same amount of prime DMAA was added and Compound (I) (0.2M, 64g) was fed into the flask.<br>
The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C and kept at these conditions for 5 hours (monitored by HPLC - conversion of Compound (I) to Azoxystrobin 98-99%).<br>
