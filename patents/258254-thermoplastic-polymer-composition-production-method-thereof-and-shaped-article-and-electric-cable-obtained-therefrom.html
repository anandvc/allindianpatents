THERMOPLASTIC POLYMER COMPOSITION, PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOF, AND SHAPED ARTICLE AND ELECTRIC CABLE OBTAINED THEREFROM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic polymer composition and a shaped article obtained from the composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic polymer composition which contains an inorganic filler in a high ratio and is excellent in flexibility, mechanical strength, elongation at break, heat resistance, scratch resistance, whitening resistance and flame retardancy, and further to a shaped article obtained by using the thermoplastic polymer composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Sheath materials and some insulating materials for electric cables are frequently polyvinyl chloride and crosslinked polyethylene, and their flexibility, flame retardancy and insulation property are appreciated. However, there are difficulties in their disposition or recycling because of the<br><br>
generation of chlorine gases by heating and the lack of thermoplasticity. For this reason, there has been known a shaped article comprising a crystalline homopolymer or copolymer of polyethylene which is non-crosslinked and is recyclable and has mechanical and electrical properties fit for usual use conditions as disclosed in Patent Document 1. The shaped article used in Patent Document 1 is excellent in flexibility, impact resistance and low-temperature property, but is insufficient in scratch resistance and tensile strength.<br>

As the propylene-based polymer (A) used in the present invention, there may be mentioned a propylene homopolymer or a copolymer of propylene with at least one olefin selected from ethylene and α-olefins having 4 to 20 carbon atoms.  Here, as ethylene and the α-olefins having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, there may be  mentioned  ethylene,   1-butene,   1-pentene,   1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene,    1-octene,    1-decene,    1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene and 1-eicosene, and preferable are ethylene and the α-olefins having 4 to 10 carbon atoms.  These α-olefins may form a random copolymer or a block copolymer with propylene. [0019]<br>
The constituent units derived from ethylene and the α-olefins having 4 to 20 carbon atoms may be contained in an amount of 35 mol% or less, preferably 30 mol% or less in the whole constituent units of the propylene-based polymer (A). [0020]<br>
The propylene-based polymer (A) usually has a melt flow rate<br>

The measurement of the melting point (Tm) is carried out as follows. That is, the melting point is a peak temperature in an endothermic curve observed when a sample in an aluminum pan is heated to 200°C at an elevation rate of 100°C/min and maintained at 200°C for 5 minutes and then cooled to -150°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min and subsequently heated again to 200°C at an elevation rate of 10°C/min. [0022]<br>
The propylene-based polymer (A) may have an isotactic structure or a syndiotactic structure, but preferably has an isotactic structure in terms of heat resistance and the like. [0023]<br>
Further, a plurality of propylene-based polymers (A) may be used simultaneously if needed.  For example, two or more components which are different in melting point and rigidity may be used. [0024]<br>
Depending   on   desired  physical   properties,   the propylene-based polymer (A) may be selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of a homopolypropylene excellent in heat resistance (in which a comonomer other than propylene typically accounts for 3 mol% or less) , a block polypropylene excellent in balance between heat resistance and impact resistance (which typically has 3 to 30 % by weight of a n-decane-soluble rubber component) , and a random polypropylene excellent in balance between flexibility and transparency (which typically has a melting peak of 120°C or higher and preferably in the range of 125°C to 150°C, as measured by <x differential scanning calorimeter these polypropylenes may be simultaneously used.></x>

These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds . Of these, especially preferably used is at least one of ethylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. [0027]<br>
The propylene-based polymer (B) used in the present invention usually has a melt flow rate (temperature: 230°C and load: 2.16 kg) of 0.1 to 50 (g/10 min) . In addition, the propylene-based polymer (B) has a melting point as measured by<br>
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of less than 120°C or has no observed melting point, and preferably has a melting point of 100°C or lower or has no observed melting point. Here, that a melting point is not observed means that a crystal fusion peak with a heat of crystal fusion of 1 J/g or higher is not observed in the range of -150 to 200°C. The measurement conditions are described in Examples. [0028]<br>
A method of producing the propylene-based polymer (B) is not particularly limited. For example, the propylene-based polymer (B) may be produced by a method described in WO 04/87775. [0029]<br>

The random copolymer contains 40 to 85 mol% of constituent units derived from propylene, 5 to 30 mol% of constituent units derived from ethylene, and 5 to 30 mol% of constituent units derived from the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms (here, the total of constituent units derived from propylene, constituent units derived from butene and constituent units derived from the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms is 100 mol%). [0093]<br>
The graft-modified random copolymer (BB-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms preferably satisfies at least one, more preferably both of the following (ol) and (pi).<br>
(ol) The Shore A hardness is 30 to 80 and preferably 35 to 60.<br>
(pi)  The degree of crystallinity measured by X-ray diffraction is 20 % or less and preferably 10 % or less. [0094]<br>
Preferably, the graft-modified random copolymer (BB-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms has a melting point (Tm) as measured by DSC of 50°C or less or<br><br>
has no observed melting point.  The measurement of the melting point may be carried out by the same method as that of the first graft-modified propylene-based polymer (BB) and the like. [0095]<br>
As regards the amounts of the propylene component and other comonomer components in the random copolymer of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms in the graft-modified random copolymer (BB-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, the random copolymer preferably contains 60 to 82 mol% and more preferably 61 to 75 mol% of constituent units derived from propylene; 8.0 to 15 mol% and more preferably 10 to 14 mol% of constituent units derived from ethylene; and 10 to 25 mol% and more preferably 15 ~o 25 mol% of constituent units derived from the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms (here, the total of constituent units derived from propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms is 100 mol%) . As the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, 1-butene is especially preferably used. [0096]<br>
Such graft-modified random copolymer (BB-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms may be produced, for example, by graft-modifying the random copolymer (C-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms described in the section of the first thermoplastic<br><br>
polymer composition, with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a vinyl compound containing a polar group and a silane compound. Alternatively, the graft-modified random copolymer (BB-lb) may be produced by blending a graft-modified product of the random copolymer (C-lb) of propylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms with the random copolymer (B-2) of propylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms described in the section of the first thermoplastic polymer composition. [0097]<br>
By use of the modified random copolymer (C-lb) of propylene, ethylene and the α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, the obtainable thermoplastic polymer composition is more excellent in flexibility, scratch resistance and whitening resistance, and also excellent in low temperature brittleness resistance. In addition, the thermoplastic polymer composition can give a shaped article, for example electric cable, which has an advantage that the coating of the electric cable is unlikely to be broken even when exposed to a low temperature. [0098]<br>
As described above, the graft-modified propylene-based polymer (BB) is partly or fully graft-modified with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a vinyl compound containing a polar group and a silane compound, and has a melting<br>
point, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) , of less than 120°C or has no observed melting point. Examples of the vinyl compounds containing a polar group and silane compounds used in the production of the graft-modified propylene-based polymer include those used in the production of the graft-modified propylene-based polymer (C) in the first thermoplastic polymer composition of the invention. The graft-modifying (graft copolymerizing) methods and the radical initiators are as described in the section of the production of the graft-modified propylene-based polymer (C) in the first thermoplastic polymer composition of the present invention. [0099]<br>
The graft-modified propylene-based polymer (BB) used in the present invention is partly or fully graft-modified with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a vinyl compound containing a polar group and a silane compound, and has a melting point, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) , of less than 120°C or has no observed melting point. The graft amount of the vinyl compound containing a polar group and the silane compound is not particularly limited but is typically 0.01 to 10 % by weight and preferably 0.05 to 5 % by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the modified propylene-based polymer (BB) . By use of the graft-modified propylene-based polymer (BB) in the present invention, the obtainable shaped article is<br><br>
excellent especially in balance between tensile strength and<br>
scratch resistance.<br>
[0100]<br>
The inorganic filler (D), and optional components such as ethylene-based polymer (E) and oil (F) are as described in the first thermoplastic polymer composition.<br><second thermoplastic polymer composition and second shaped article><br>
The second thermoplastic polymer composition of the present invention contains 5. 0 to 64 . 9 % by weight, preferably 5. 0 to 49. 9 % by weight of the propylene-based polymer (A) ; 0 .1 to 60 % by weight, preferably 10.1 to 40 % by weight: of tine graft-modified propylene-based polymer (BB) ; and 35 to 75 % by weight, preferably 40 to 60 % by weight of the inorganic filler (D) (here, the total amount of (A), (BB) and (D) is 100 % by weight). [0101]<br>
Further, the thermoplastic polymer composition may contain the ethylene-based polymer (E) . For example, the copolymer (E-l) of ethylene with the α-olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms or the graft-modified ethylene-based polymer (E-2) may be used in an amount of 0.1 to 20 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the components (A) , (BB) and (D) . If the amount of the ethylene-based polymer (E-l) is within this range, low temperature characteristics are significantly improved.<br>
[0102]<br>
Further, the oil (F) may be used in the present invention in an amount of 0.1 to 20 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the components (A) , (BB) and (D) . If the amount of the oil (F) is within this range, low temperature characteristics are significantly improved and the oil is unlikely to bleed out on the surface of the shaped article. [0103]<br>
The second thermoplastic polymer composition of the present invention may contain additives as required while still achieving the objects of the invention. Examples of the additives include synthetic resins, rubbers, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, weather stabilizers, slip agents, antiblocking agents, nucleating agents, pigments, hydrochloric acid absorbers, and copper inhibitors. The amounts of such synthetic resins, rubbers and additives are not particularly limited as long as the objects of the present invention are not impaired. In a preferred embodiment, the components (A), (BB), and (D) are contained so that the total of them is 60 to 100 % by weight of the thermoplastic polymer composition. The balance is accounted for by the above-mentioned components such as synthetic resins, rubbers, additives, ethylene-based polymer (E), and oil (F) .<br><methods of producing thermoplastic polymer compositions><br>

the present invention may be produced by conventionally known methods. For example, they may be produced by melt-kneading the components described above.<br>

Part of (C) or (E) may not be melt-blended beforehand, and may be supplied together with the component (A) and the like separately from the propylene-based polymer composition (G)<br>

The production in this manner is preferable because the scratch resistance may be further improved while maintaining other physical properties. [0107]<br>
Part of (BB) or (E) may not be melt-blended beforehand, and may be supplied together with the component (A) and the like separately from the propylene-based polymer composition (GG) (melt-kneaded product).
