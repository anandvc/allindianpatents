				<td>OBJECT QF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention Is to aim at extraction of azadlrachtin from neem seed kernel, In a very simplified but efficient manner which has highest level of azadlrachtin and without allowing mycotoxins contamination, and consequently to prepare neem oil based emulsion concentrate, a stable pesticide containing mostiy the iimonoids of neem as it occurs in nature in the neem seed, and hence fit to be called as neem based pesticide.<br>
In addition, the Invention also aims at extracting the constituents of custard<br>
apple fh3m immature fruits and leaves as well as fix&gt;m mature seeds using the desired solvents and dousing It Into a neem seed kernel extract In the course of the preparation of neem oil emulsion concentrate without affecting the pesticidal properties of the llmanoids of neem leading to a botanical pesticide, a combination of neem and custard apple whereby the pesticidal potency of neem as well as of custand apple are exploited for the benefit of controllirtg pests which posses mere susceptibility to either neem or custard apple and hence more order of pests can be controlled through combination.<br>
The first object of the Invention is to form storage stable neem oil emulsion which contains a desired amount Azadlrachtin to be an effiective pesticide and also combine these with the extracts of custard apple to exploit the pestlcidal properties of custard apple in the immature fruit stage, seed stage as well as In tjhe leaves and thereby producing a totally natural and effective herbal pesticide containing the characteristics of neem and custard apple leading a preparation of neutral pesticide which benefit nrK&gt;ne number of target pests in the process of pest control.<br>
It Is another object of the invention to extract neem oil as well as Azadlrachtin simultaneously from the neem seeds.<br><br>
The other object of the invention includes^ to extract out the constituents of custard apple from its immature ^its^ immature seeds and leaves and dousing it in the neem oil preparation to enhance or improve the pesticidal properties of neem In combination with the synergistic constituents of custard apple extracts.<br>
It is anotlier object of the invention to form environmentally safe pesticide taking advantage of the pesticide characteristics found in plants like neem tree and custard apple in their specil^c parts like neem seeds as well as In the Immature fruits, mature seeds and leaves of Annona Squmosa and Annona Reticulata -comn^nly referred to as Custard Apple and developing a herbal based combination pesticide, which In no way Inhibits the main objective of inventing an environmentally saf5e pesticide a combination pesticide.<br>
It is another object of the invention to form an pesticide which contains neem oil, desired amount of Azadlrachtin emulsifying agent and desired preparation of extracts from immature fruits of Annona Squmosa and Annona Reticulata.<br>
As per the invention, neem oil as well as Azadirachtin are sinruiltaneousiy extracted from the neem seeds and the extracts of custard apple AnrÂ»na Squmosa and Annona Reticulata from their Inrimature frirfts, seeds and leaves, extracted separately and doused in the preparation at appropriate tinne as described in the process of the preparation of neem oil emulsion based pesticides.<br>
The Invention has    been described and illustrated with pnaferences and<br>
ranges In the foregoing paras, much variation therein may be done by those skilled In the art without departing from the sport and &amp;x&gt;pe of the Invention claims.<br>
Rjrther to produce it In a nrwst economical and Inexpensive nnethods, with minimal chemlcallsation and to produce through simple techniques which are more natural than chemical and at the same time extract the iimonoids of neem seed<br><br>
with high yields of pofient tetranortripenoids Including azadlrachtin (an antlfeedaant iimonoid) with high oil content as high as 85.00% and further the potency of such pesticide so produced is also enhanced to a great extent without affecting the basic concept of safe and environment freely pesticide through the deployment of the extracts of ciBtard apple obtained fhsm the immature fruits and seeds and leaves of Annona Squmosa and Annona Reticulata pnaductjon of a combinab'on pesticide of hert)al base which is safe, environment friendly pesticide and further that which enhanced the pesticide potential of the resultant pesticide and results in greater bioefficacy by increasing the control capability of more number of target pests.<br>
The Invention herein described relates to a process for preparing a neem based emulsifying concentrats containing azadlrachtin not less than 300 ppm, neem oil more than 85%, aportSc solvent by volume 3.90 % and less than SO % and not nrwre than S,00 % percent of ethoxylated vegetable oil containing long chain fatty alcohol series ttiom CS to CIS by volume and which can enter Into a stable oil water emulsion without degrading azadlrachtin content along with addition of not more than 5% of the extracts fhDm custard apple Immature fruits, seeds and leaves without degrading the efficacy of Azadlrachtin contained under the same time having Azadlrachtin synergisticism with neem linrx}noids facilitating the enhancement of pesticidal potency and thereby leading to Azadlrachtin combination pesticide with high bio-efTicacy standards without affecting the safe and environment frieraliy nature of neem based combination pesticides. This formulation formulated by the process of this invention has found its application and usage as a pest control formulation in Agriculture, and in Veterinary with higher bioefficacy and poteru:y to control more number of target pests.<br>
There are a number of chemical, broad-spectrum pesticide formulations, systemic and contact, available for the control of Insect pests that attack and<br><br>
damage food crops and economically im|X)rtant crops. Tliese chemical pesticides aim at pest eradication and kill the pests and insects and in this process all the insects good and bad insects are killed and in addition they not only affect the ecosystem but also pollute the atmosphere with chemical, kills the natural enemies to pests and other beneficial microorganisms and pollute the water we drink, air we breathe and food we eat. The pests or the insects also develop resistance to the pesticide in the coarse of time on continuous usage. Hence^ a need for pest control agent which are biodegradable that which are ecofriendly, biodegradable, that does not affect the beneficial organisms, non-toxic to ecosystem and human beir^js and at the same time effective against the target pest or insect is fait and the answer is this invention at least partiy If not fully.<br>
The Pesticidal plant that has drawn the attention of many scientists, researchers, and industrialist all over the world the Neem {Aadirachta indica A JLSS) is widely spread in India and Pakistan and some parts of South Bast Asia. The neem tree and its various parts (Ijaaves, Seeds, Bark etc.,) have (bund Its application in various fields like food, medicine, and cosmetics and in agriculture. Out of the various parts of the neem tree the neem seeds In different forms Utoa neem oil, neem cake, neem seed extracts have found wide application in various fields. In agriculture the Neem seeds and its various forrrÂ« are used as nitrogen fertilizer, pesticide, fungicides, nematicides etc., the usage of neem s^xl is more advisable than usage of other parts like green leaves, bark and not because these will affect the life if the neem tree where as neem seed wUl not<br>
Similarly, the additive from the satellite plant used in tif^s {^reparation is a natural combination pesticide viz., Annona Squmosa and Arnxina Reticulata only referred to as custard apple also known as plants with pesticidal properties. Many scientific refererKes indicate that the various parts of tNs plant have pesticidal property. The extracts of its different parts viz.. Immature fruits, seeds and leaves have been scientifically found to have insecticidal property. The aqueous extracts of<br><br>
different parts of custard apple were tried in a crude form in the control of a number of pests that commonly aflfects diflferent agrlcuituraj crops. It is well known that custard apple is used as a common fruits in tropical countries Including mid an southem parts of India. There are a number of references and literature available to prove that it has pesticidal property.<br>
There are a number of nsferences and literatures available. (Schmutterer et Ai 19eO;Schmutt5erer amd Ascher, 1984, 1987; Jacobson 1966^1988; Randhawa and Parmar 1993) Neem seed is a storehouse of over 100 tetrenortritserpenoids and diverse isoprenoids (Devakumar and Sukh Dev 1993) with Insectlcldal pno|3erty.<br>
The most important and biologically proven active corstituent of neem seeds is the Azadirachtin. Several isomers of azadirachtin have been identified and out of the isomers the most potent and active component is the Azadirachtin A<br>
There are a number of articles reporting the insect antifeedant and insect growth inhibitory properties of azadirachtin for a variety of insect pests (Butterworth J.H. and Morgan, ED., J.Chem.Soc.Chem. Cummuns. 23 1968; Leushner, K, IMaturwissenschaften, 59,217,1972; Ruscoe,C.N.E, Nature, lond., 236,466,1972 Schmutterer, H and Rembold, H.Z, Angew. Ent 2,179-188, 1980; Wartherv J.D.Jr., ARMNE-4 USOAr SEA, Agricuiturat review and maiuiais, 1979; Kubo, I and klocke, J.A., Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, 46,1951, 1982; Champagne, D.E, Kbul, O., Isman, M,B., Scudder, G.E and Towers, GH.N., phytochemlstry, 31, 377,1992).<br>
There are a number of articles contributing insecticidat property to the extracts from seeds, immature fruits and leaves of Annona Sqi.Â«nnosa and Annona Reticulata, The constituents of custard apple extracts from Immature fruits, mature seeds and leaves have also been reported to be safe and have no mammalian toxicity.<br><br>
Azadlrachtin has also been reported to be Non-Mutagenic (jacooson^ivi., proceedings of the first International Neem conference, Rottach Egem, 33, 1980; in natural pesticides ftiom the neem tree, Azadirachta indica A.Juss, Schmutberer, H., Ascher, K.R.S., German agency for technical cooperatiorv Eshbon\ Qemnan, 1981) and It appears to have no apparent mammalian toxlcity( Nakashini, K, Recent advances in phytochemistry,5,283, 1975 ; Morgan, ED., Proceedings of the Rrst international neem conference, Rottach Egern, 43, 1980; in Natural pesticides from neem tree, Azadirachta indica A.Juss, Schmutfcerer, H., Ascher, KR.S., Rembold, H., Eds., German Agency for Technical cooperation, Eschbom, Germany 1981).<br>
It has also been reported that neem products with or without azadlrachtin has shown very good control over 300 Insect pests and Infections by nematodes viruses and some pathogenic fungi (Devakun^r .C, and Parmar. B,S., 1993). The other timonoids or the bitter principle such as Azadlrachtin, Salanin, Meliarttrlol, deacetylsatanin, and nimbtn contained In the neem oil are also responsible for the pesticldal activity of neem oil (Vimal O.P and Naphade, K.T., 1980 Jour, Sole. Ind. Res. Vol. 39, P 197-211)<br>
Though Individually neem and custard apple have been reported to have varied Insectlcldal properties so far no attempts have been made to understand the efRcacy of the combination, viz., neem oil with custard apple extracts In the production of a safe and eco friendly pestjclde towards the conljol of agricultural pests.<br>
Plant based pesticides are normally preferred due to Its shorter persistence in the atnrKisphere, biodegradable, non-toxiclty to the ecosystem, atmosphere, human beings, and beneficial microorganism, harmless to birds, fish, and low toxicity to flora and fauna. Neem oil, extracted finm neem seeds of the neem tree, is known for Its high pesticldal value. Due to Its low coverage, low evaporation capacity from<br><br>
the leaves^ and as it sticks to the surface of the leaves it stays in the leaves for a long time and turns toxic to the plants^ hence neem oil spray per say is neither efHcient nor preferable to neem oil based EC. formulation with Annona sps. Additives.<br>
The pesticides produced with combination of neem and custard apple extracts 3S ref^msd above has t^en found to be non-toxic, aco-friendiy and efficient as p^ control agent with increased bio-efficacy with synergicism with rÂ«em and without any hazardous effects to mammals and non polluting the atmosphere.<br>
i-lence from ti^ above studies, It is obvious that a2!adirachtin is considered to be a promising environmentally compatible, non-toxic Insect pest control molecule for plant protsctioa This molecule in Its pure form has not conne to commercial use because it is expensive to isolate it In a pure form fix&gt;m the ne&amp;n seed/kernel extract and It is a very complex molecule for an economical chemical synthesis. Azadlrachtin has also been found to degrade rapidly due to environmental factors such as UV radiation in sunlight, heat, air moisture, acidity and enzymes present In foliar surfaces (Sundaram, K M. S and Curry, J., Journal of Pesticide Science, 41, 129, 1994).<br>
Ttiese negativities of the Azadirachtin wNch may express itself under unfavourable agro-climatic condition, is neutralized by this formulation. The Bio-efUcacy aspects is further ei^ianced through the addition of the extracts of custard apple obtained fr-om immature fruits, mature seeds and teaves of the Annona Squnxisa and Annona Reticulata plants which extract has synergicism with other linrx3noids of neem and does not in any way neither fundamentally alter the toxicological properties of the ncwim preparation not its eco-friendly nature.<br><br>
A scan through the literature indicates ra such prior art There are so much idea as expressed to produce a combination pesticide with ne@m and ei^Eird dpp]% seem to have occurred in the past even through individual plants like custard apple ones we studied extensively for its pesticidal properties.<br>
In the prior art^ Butter worth and i^rgan (Butter worth, J. H. arxi Morgan, E D., J. Insect Physiol., 17, 969, 1971) prepared azadirachtin from neem seeds by extraction with ethanol, partitioning of the concentrate of ethanot extract between methanol and light petroleum, chromatography of partition product, fham methanol phase leading to azadirachtin containing fractions, partitioning again by preparative layer chromatography of azadirachtin containing fractions resulting in azadirachtin (1.5 g.). The product obtained in this process (76 g.) would be economical to obtailn but it would be viscous and oily due to ttie presence of water soluble compounds and therefore, it is not suitable for preparing good formulations,- and the steps Involved in the process are too many and makes it cumbersome and not simple for commercial application in large scale and therefore requires further simplification in processing by less expensive less cumt&gt;ersome techniques for the preparation of a ready to use product enriched in azadirachtin. (Moreover the solvent used is only ettianol and it has been reported by many that 100 % extraction of the amdirachtin from ttÂ« neem seed Is not possible and a combination of solvents is always recommended for better extraction of azadirachtin from the neem seeds)<br>
In the prior art; Uebel, Warthen, Jr. and Jacobson (Uebel, E C, Waitheii, if. J. D. and Jacobson, M, J. Uq. Chromatogr., 2, 878, l^f) hiVe liOlfSed azadirachtin from neem seeds/kernels (4a 2 kg.) Invotving grinding neem seeds/kÂ»mels in hexane in a Waring blender, filtration of the homog^naeg W glvÂ« a residue marc, soxhiet extraction of powdered marc so obtained with acetone for 24 h, washing of acetone extract with hexane, watjer, and hexane, Â«nd trTeatmentof washed acetone extract with 70/30, 75/25, methanot/water, treatment of 70/30, 75/25 nrwthanol/water soluble parts with 75/25, diethyl ether/acetone to give<br><br><br><br>
Neemgold containing 300 ppm azadirachtin and Neemazal F but these preparation are ^ndamentally diffierent from the expressed in tNs invention.<br>
The procedure consists of the following stieps; (1), ground fwaom seed<br>
Icemeis were first extracted in a soxhiet with petroleum ether to remove fotty matter; (2), the extraction was continued with solvents such as MIBK and MTB or acetone or MeOH or AZT or MEK or butanoi for 10 h.; (3), the residue from AZT extract after removal of the solvent was treated with medianoi; (4), the methanol soluble portion from sbsp 3, was subjected to liquid-iiquid extraction with methanol 50% and light petroleum giving rise to AZT-VR-NR in a yield of 1-1.S% which is expected to be enriched in a2adirachtin.<br>
In the broadest scope the invention nalates to a pnocess which netates to environmentally safe and storage stable, neem oil emulsion, which emulsion contain required amount of a2adirachtin.<br>
In the present invention azadirachtin Is extracted fixÂ»m neem seeds alongwith neem oil. In addition, the constituents c^ tiie neem caloa and the neem seed kernels are extracted in as is done elsewiiens in otiier inventions tiirough liquid phase of the solvent by penoolating into the gn&gt;und bio-mass of the neem seed kernels but here, the liquid phase of the solvent is converted Into a gaseous state and these vapourised state of the solvent In a gaseous oondltton is allowed to pass through the ground bkimass where Xhet vapours condense and reconverted to a state of liquid phase again and thereby percolates efRcientty Into the dough of the biomass and in the process of condensation acts as a liquid solvent percolates freely and dissolves the limonoids of the neem. The percolatton Initkilty In a gaseous state and subsequently into a liquid state makes the process of extraction nmre effective then the liquid state solvent extractkm procedure alorÂ¥3 as Ntherto employed by other in such similar processes. The lipids and lipo proteins in the neem oil protect the limorKiid azadirachtin from UV degradatioa<br><br>
In addition. In this invention the pesticidal potency of custard apple from the<br><br><br>

and washed in water containing fungicides like Dinltn&gt; DIbromo propane 1^3 dioi f and shade dried to remove the surface moisture, but not allowing the fruits to whither.<br>
b.	The seeds of custard apple (Annona Squmosa and Annona Redculata) are<br>
collected by crushing matured fruits in water through wooden agiCBtors<br>
without injuring die seeds. The pulp is separated from the seeds through<br>
v^ater washings, filtrBtlon, methodologies and the seeds are ooliected and sun<br>
dried. After sun drying, the seeds are cleaned by winnowing. The seeds are<br>
drifxi. Natural (eaves of custard a(^[&gt;(e are coifected and sun dried and<br>
puh/erized.<br>
c.	The immature fruits, the seeds and (eaves are mixed and crushed. The<br>
crushing is done using power driven wooden crushers (rotary crushers) or<br>
grinding stone. The proportion is 1:1 of inwnatwie fruits and seeds by weight<br>
and the crushed leaf powder are added to desired {avei wMch is standardtaed<br>
by eyes which Is done by experience.<br><br>
