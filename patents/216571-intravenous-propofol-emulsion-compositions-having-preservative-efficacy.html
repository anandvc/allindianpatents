The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to stable Propofol oil-in-water emulsion compositions for intravenous administration having preservative efficacy.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent used for the induction of general anesthesia in adult patients and pediatric patients older than 3 years of age; maintenance of general anesthesia in adult patients and pediatric patients older than 2 months of age; and intensive care unit (ICU) sedation for intubated, mechanically ventilated adults. 20 ml ampoule of 1% propofol emulsion.<br>
Initial clinical trials were in 1977, in a form solubilised in cremophor EL, but due to anaphylactic reactions it was withdrawn from the market. It was subsequently reformulated as an aqueous emulsion in intralipid and re-launched in 1986 by AstraZeneca with the brand name "Diprivan". The current preparation is 1% propofol solubilised in 10% soybean oil and contains 1.2% purified egg phospholipid, 2.25% glycerol and has a pH between 6.0 and 8.5 and a pKa of 11. Diprivan contains EDTA as an antimicrobial agent. Newer generic formulations contain sodium metabisulfite or benzyl alcohol.<br>
Propofol is approved for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in more than 50 countries.<br>
Aside from the hypotension and transient apnea following induction doses, one of its most frequent side-effects is pain on injection, especially in smaller veins. This pain can be mitigated by pretreatment or mixing with intravenous lidocaine. Alternative formulations with a larger proportion of medium-chain triglycerides (as opposed to Intralipid) appear to have less pain on injection, possibly due to lower concentrations of free aqueous propofol. (Source: Wikipedia)<br>
Propofol injections usually are made by diluting Propofol in oils and then formulated into oil-in-water type of emulsions. The compositions of the Propofol<br>
2<br><br>
incorporated into the oily phase and made into oil-in-water emulsions for intravenous administration.<br>
A Propofol / soybean oil emulsion has gained widespread use for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia, for maintenance of monitored anaesthesia care and for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is advantageous in that it possesses both a rapid onset anaesthesia and a short recovery time. However, the presence of vegetable oils and phospholipids makes the emulsion highly prone to the risk of microbial growth.<br>
Intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions are being increasingly used for sedation of seriously ill patients particularly in ICUs wherein it is continuously infused. There are noscomial (i.e. hospital acquired) infections observed very often in ICU patients. Hence it is recommended that the intravenous administration sets are changed frequently, at least every 6 or 12 hours. Continuous infusion makes the product susceptible to microbial growth.<br>
In order to reduce the risk of uncontrolled microbial growth, additions of various potential preservatives into intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions have been tried. Some of the potential agents found to cause instability of the emulsion. Other potential agents failed to provide the level of antimicrobial activity being sought. It is necessary to preserve the compositions with preservatives that would provide the required levels of antimicrobial activity at as low a concentration as possible in order to minimise the potential for physical instability and to minimise toxicity concerns.<br>
EP-A-0814787 (published 7th January 1998; corresponding to US-A-5714520, issued 3r February 1998) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an edetate as an antimicrobial agent. The amount of edetate is preferably no more than 0.1% by weight but is sufficient to prevent a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538)<br>
3<br><br>
Eschericha coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition at approximately 50 to 250 colony-forming units per ml at a temperature in the range 20 - 25Â°C, incubated in that temperature range and tested for viable counts of said organism after 24 hours. The currently marketed formulation comprises 1% w/v Propofol, 10% w/v Soybean Oil, 1.2% w/v Egg Phosphatides as an emulsifier, 2.25% w/v Glycerol and 0.0055% w/v disodium edetate, Sodium hydroxide and Water for Injection.<br>
Edetate has been shown to delay but not to prevent the onset of microbial growth in Propofol emulsions (see WO-A-00/24376, infra). Propofol emulsion compositions are required to be diluted up to 5 times (1:4) for long-term infusion. On dilution the edetate concentration gets reduced to 0.0011%. Edetate alone is found to be ineffective in preventing a no more than 10 fold increase in broad-spectrum microbial growth at concentrations of 0.0025% and below (see US-A-6028108; infra).<br>
WO-A-99/39696 (published 12th August 1999; corresponding to US-A-6469069 issued 22nd October 2002) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing a sulphite as an antimicrobial agent. The amount of sulphite preferably is in the range 0.0075% to 0.66% by weight and is sufficient to prevent a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) Eschericha coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition at approximately 50 to 250 colony-forming units per ml and incubated at a temperature in the range 30-35 Â°C and tested for viable counts of said organism after 24 hours. The use of sulphite has two problems; viz. (a) stability of the emulsion is affected and (b) it is potentially toxic material at little higher dose level.<br>
4<br><br>
Reference is made to the water-immiscible solvent of the oil-in-water emulsion being a mono-, di-, or triglyceride. The preferred amount of solvent is 5 to 25 % by weight.<br>
Infusion of preferred compositions is accordance with WO-A-99/39696/US-A-6469069 at a rate of 50 ug/kg/min for 24 hours will result in sulphite concentrations approaching the toxic levels. Further, the compositions may cause allergic reactions because of the sulphite molecule and the compositions have been reported to be physically and chemically unstable on exposure (see Han J et al International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2001, 215(l-2):207 - 220 &amp; Baker MT et al Anesthesiology 2002, 97(5): 1162 -1167).<br>
WO-A-00/24376 (published 4th May 2000; corresponding to US-A-6140373 &amp; US-A-6140374, both issued 31st October 2000) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an antimicrobial agent selected from (a) benzyl alcohol alone or, preferably, together with either sodium edetate or sodium benzoate and (b) benzethonium chloride. Preferably, the composition comprises Propofol 0.1 -5.0 % by wt.; vegetable oil, preferably soybean oil, 1- 30 % by wt; surfactant, preferably egg phosphatide, 0.2 to 2 % by wt.; glycerol 2 - 3 % by wt.; and antimicrobial agent selected from (i) benzyl alcohol 0.0175 - 0.9 % by wt., (ii) benzyl alcohol 0.07 - 0.9 % by wt and sodium edetate 0.005% by wt., (iii) benzethonium chloride 0.01% to 0.1% by wt. and, most preferably, (iv) benzyl alcohol 0.0175 - 0.9 % by wt. and sodium benzoate 0.07% by wt.<br>
Reference is made to the water-immiscible solvent of the oil-in-water emulsion being an ester of a medium or long chain fatty acid, exemplified as a mono-, di-, or triglyceride. The preferred amount of solvent is 10 to 20 % by weight.<br>
For long-term use, the antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and benzethonium chloride are not recommended, as they are toxic.<br>
5<br><br>
WO-A-00/59471 (published 12th October 2000; corresponding to US-A-6100302, issued 8th August 2000) discloses intravenous anaesthetic Propofol emulsions having decreased levels of soybean oil, fats or triglycerides. The formulation preferably consists of phospholipid-coated microdroplets ranging from 160 to 200 nanometers in diameter. These microdroplets contain a sphere of Propofol dissolved in a solvent, such as vegetable oil, surrounded by a stabilizing layer of a phospholipid. It is reported that this formulation can safely provide sedation over extended periods of time and that the low oil concentration emulsion containing Propofol provides a stable oil-in-water emulsion and unexpectedly exhibits antimicrobial properties comparable to higher water immiscible solvent concentration emulsions containing preservatives.<br>
Typically the composition in the above patent specification comprises from 0.1 to 5%, by weight, preferably 1% to 2% by weight, of Propofol. The water-immiscible solvent, preferably soybean oil, is suitably present in an amount that is from 0.1 to 3% and more suitably from 1 to 3% by weight of the composition. However, the reduction in the oil content makes the injection more painful because of free Propofol in the aqueous phase.<br>
Object:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a sterile, stable pharmaceutical oil-in-water emulsion composition of Propofol for intravenous administration having a preservative system which overcomes the drawbacks of prior art compositions.<br>
More particularly the object of the present invention is to provide oil-in-water emulsion compositions of Propofol having preservative efficacy to the extent that there will be no more than 10 fold increase for at least 24 hours in growth of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, after adventitious extrinsic contamination.<br>

Summary of the Invention :<br>
In accordance with the present inventions a stable, intravenously administrable, propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition, comprising triglyceride oils; emulsifiers selected from purified and /or modified natural phosphatides; water; tonicity modifying agents; and preservative system comprising of monoglyceryl ester of lauric acid (Monolaurin) and a member selected from<br>
(a)	capric acid and/or its soluble alkaline salts or its monoglyceryl ester (Monocaprin);<br>
(b)	edetate; and<br>
(c)	capric acid and/or its soluble alkaline salts or its monoglyceryl ester (Monocaprin) and edetate.<br>
In the Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition, the preservative system is present in a sufficient concentration to prevent a no more than 10-fold increase in growth of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours after adventitious extrinsic contamination.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention :<br>
A. Ingredients:<br>
The ingredients used in the compositions disclosed in the present invention are<br>
described here. Common ingredients as water, sodium hydroxide solution are not described.<br>
Propofol: 2,6-bis(l-methylethyl)-phenol or 2,6-diisopropylphenol<br>
CAS Number 2078-54-8 ; Ci2H180; Mol. Wt. 178.273<br>
Pharmacopoeia : Propofol complying with European Pharmacopoeial (Ph.Eur.)<br>
specifications can be used. The content of Propofol is 0.1 - 2 % w/v of the<br>
composition, preferably 0.5 - 2 % w/v, more preferably about 1 - 2 % w/v and<br>
most preferably about 1% w/v or about 2% w/v of the emulsion composition.<br>
7<br><br>
Triglyceride oils: triglyceride oil is selected from vegetable triglyceride oils and / or synthetic triglyceride oils. Vegetable triglyceride oils are usual vegetable oils such as soybean oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, olive oil. The synthetic triglyceride oil typically is manufactured from a vegetable oil, which is chemically and/or physically modified and/or purified. MCT oil is a typical example of synthetic oil and is obtained from the fixed oil extracted from the hard, dried fraction of the endosperm of Cocos nucifera L. Hydrolysis of the fixed oil followed by distillation yields the required fatty acids, which are then re-esterified to produce MCT oil (Medium-chain Triglycerides) that are mainly glycerol esters of caproic (C6), Caprylic (Cg), Capric (Cio) and lauric cid (C12) in a ratio of approximately 2:55:42:1. (source: http://www.pdrhealth.com)<br>
In general the triglyceride oil is not more than 30% w/v of the composition. Preferably, it is 5% - 20% w/v of the composition, more preferably it is about 10% w/v of the composition. The present invention may also comprise any combination of one or more vegetable oils and / or synthetic oils. Soybean oil is the preferred vegetable oil used in the compositions of the present invention. Soybean oil used in these compositions is preferably refined, bleached, deodorised and preferably free of heavy metal contaminants. Soybean oil complying with specifications of European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.) / United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) is preferred.<br>
Phosphatides:<br>
In the oil-in water emulsion compositions of the present invention purified and /or modified natural phosphatide is used as an emulsifier for stabilization of the oil-in-water emulsion. The preferred natural phosphatide used is either purified egg lecithin or purified soya lecithin or a mixture thereof. More preferably the natural phosphatide used is purified egg lecithin. The amount of said purified natural phosphatide is 0.1% - 3% w/v preferably it is about 1.2% w/v.<br>
8<br><br>
Phosphatides are well known for forming liposomes when hydrated with aqueous media. However they are not used in the present invention for forming liposomal compositions. They are employed in the present invention as emulsifier and for stabilizing the emulsion.<br>
Tonicity modifying agents; The composition of the present invention is made isotonic to blood by incorporating a suitable tonicity modifying agent such as Glycerin, Dextrose, or Mannitol. Glycerin is the preferred tonicity modifying agent.<br>
Preservatives :<br>
The preservative system used in the present invention comprises monoglyceryl ester of lauric acid (Monolaurin) and a member selected from<br>
(a)	capric acid and/or its soluble alkaline salts or its monoglyceryl ester (Monocaprin);<br>
(b)	edetate; and<br>
(c)	capric acid and/or its soluble alkaline salts or its monoglyceryl ester (Monocaprin) and edetate.<br>
Monoglyceryl Ester Of Lauric Acid (Monolaurin)<br>
When one of the hydroxyl group of glycerol is esterified with fatty acids, it is called monoacylglycerol or monoglyceride. When one OH group at either end of glycerol molecule is esterified with lauric acid it forms 1-monoglyceryl ester of lauric acid (1-monolaurin). When OH group at the middle or 2nd position of glycerol molecule is esterified with lauric acid it forms 2-monoglyceryl ester of lauric acid (2-monolaurin). Of these two monolaurins, 1-monolaurin is preferred as a preservative in the present invention. The term Monolaurin as used in this specification refers to all pharmaceutically acceptable glyceryl mono esters of lauric acid having molecular formula C15H30O4 and a molecular weight of about 274.4 and it does not include ethoxylated or propoxylated monolaurins. Commercially available Monolaurin is also known by other names such as "rac-1-<br>
9<br><br>
Lauroylglycerol", " 1 -Monododecanoyl-rac-glycerol", " 1 -Monolauroyl-rac-glycerol", "rac-Glycerol 1-laurate", and "DL-a-Laurin".<br>
A mixture of 1 and 2 monoglycerides, or 2-monoglycerides of lauric acid are also Monolaurins. Monolaurin may contain some diglycerides of lauric acid. The extent of purity of Monolaurin is not crucial, it should be rich in C12 (lauric) fatty acid but presence of small amounts of C10, CM etc fatty acids are acceptable.<br>
Monolaurin exhibits polymorphism, a form, p' form and P form; they have been reported to have melting points of 44Â°C, 59.5Â°C and 63Â°C respectively. The form of Monolaurin used in this invention is not critical for its use in this invention. Monolaurin when used in combination with capric acid or edetate or both capric acid and edetate fulfils the requirements of preventing significant growth of microorganisms for at least 24 hours in the event of adventitious extrinsic contamination as mentioned above. The requirements of the quantities may, to some extent, depend on the nature of the Monolaurin used and 1-monolaurin is preferred in this respect. Hence the quantities can not be sharply defined and word "about" is prefixed to such quantities.<br>
Monolaurin is insoluble in aqueous media but is highly soluble in the so-called fat solvents such as chloroform, benzene, ethanol, or acetone. HLB value of Monolaurin is less than 10 and therefore it is suitable as an emulsifier or solubiliser only for making water-in-oil emulsions and not oil-in-water emulsions. It is used in small quantities in the present invention as a preservative and not as an emulsifier or as a solubiliser.<br>
In rats when Monolaurin is administered orally, the LD50 has been reported to be about 53,000 mg/kg body weight.<br>
10<br><br>
Capric Acid:<br>
Capric acid is a saturated fatty acid containing C10 carbon atom naturally found in oils and fats. Capric acid is also known as Decanoic acid - CAS No. 334-48-5 having Molecular formula C10H2o02 and Molecular weight 172.27. Capric acid has better anti-fungal properties than monolaurin. Oral LD50 in rats is more than 10,000mg/kg.<br>
Purified capric acid is preferred. However, presence of small amounts of C8 or C12 or C14 or such fatty acids are acceptable.<br>
When used in Propofol compositions, when pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide, capric acid sodium salt may be formed, being ionisable water soluble salt, it acts like capric acid. Alternately sodium caprate i.e. sodium salt of capric acid can also be used to provide required amount of capric acid which will also control the pH.<br>
Salts of Capric acid:<br>
Any pharmaceutical^ acceptable soluble alkaline salts are useful. Sodium salt is preferred.<br>
Sodium salt of Capric acid is soluble in water and has a molecular weight of CH3(CH2)gCOONa and is commonly known as Sodium decanoate.<br>
Monoglyceryl ester of Capric acid (Monocaprin):<br>
Monoglyceryl esters of capric acid - monocaprate (monocaprin) can also be used to provide capric acid requirements, but free capric acid is preferred. Monocaprin is the monoglyceryl ester of Capric acid. When one hydroxyl group of glycerol is esterified with capric acid at 1-hydroxyl or 3-hydroxyl group, 1-monocaprin is obtained. Glycerol when esterified with capric acid at 2-hydroxyl group of glyercol, 2-monocaprin is obtained. Though either of the monocaprin is useful, in this invention, 1-monocaprin is preferred.<br>
11<br><br>
The amount of capric acid salts or monoglycerl ester of capric acid (monocaprin) are expressed as Capric acid in the specification.<br>
Edetate:<br>
Edetate whenever referred in this specification it includes ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and derivatives thereof. Disodium edetate is the preferred edetate in this invention, however, presence of small amounts of other salts such as tetra sodium salt are acceptable.<br>
Edetate is a metal chelating agent and used as a preservative in low concentration. The triglyceride oils used in this Propofol emulsion are contaminated with the trace amounts of metals, which deactivate the preservatives. Edetate helps to chelate the metal contaminants in the oil and thereby increase the efficiency of the preservatives.<br>
For quantitative aspects edetate is expressed as Disodium edetate which has a molecular formula C10H16N20gNa2, CAS No. 6381-92-6. Oral LD50 in rats is 2000mg/kg.<br>
Edetate concentration used in the composition of present invention itself is not sufficient to make it act as a preservative (see US Patent 6028108A). Not bound by theory, we believe that the minor quantity of edetate helps to boost the preservative activity of Monolaurin.<br>
B.        The propofol composition:<br>
The propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition, with the ingredients of the preservative used in combination with other ingredients of the composition in the present invention make the composition sufficiently effective in preventing a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of microbial cultures each of Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli<br>
12<br><br>
ATCC 8739 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 for at least 24 hours after inoculation, and provide a stable, intravenously administrable composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be made as a concentrate containing higher quantities of Propofol and then appropriately diluted for example with Dextrose solution.<br>
Some preferred compositions of the present invention are given in Table 1.<br>

It should be noted that the quantities of Propofol, oil, emulsifier, may be varied within the limits as said above in the description of the ingredients, the combinations of the preservatives are equally important. For example, Propofol can be 0.1 - 2% w/v of the composition; triglyceride oil can be up to 30 % w/v of<br>
13<br><br>
the composition and purified and/or modified natural phosphatides can be 0.1-3% w/v of the composition. Some useful variations in ingredients of the preservative system in association with these other ingredients including tonicity modifying agents are shown in Table 2.<br>
C.       Compositions of the preservative systems<br>
The preservative systems utilised in the Propofol oil-in-water emulsion compositions of the present invention comprise monoglyceryl ester of lauric acid (Monolaurin) and a member selected from<br>

The compositions containing each of the above preservative system could be prepared by different processes wherein the phosphatide is incorporated into either aqueous phase or oily phase or partly into aqueous phase and partly into oily phase.<br>
In the process of present invention, the tonicity-modifying agent is incorporated into the aqueous phase. The pH of the aqueous phase is suitably adjusted before adding the oily phase to it. Alternatively the pH of the emulsion is suitably adjusted either before homogenisation or after homogenisation.<br>
It is also possible to add the mixture of preservative system to a preformed emulsion. In such instances Monolaurin is dispersed in small quantity of water (1 in 10) at 55Â°C - 60Â°C. This is mixed well and added to preformed emulsion under stirring. Capric acid is preferably added to a preformed emulsion under stirring after melting in a water bath (30Â°C - 35Â°C).<br>
In the aforementioned process aspects, it is preferred that: the homogenisation is carried out to an average globule size of less than 500 nanometers; the homogenized composition is filtered; the resultant filtrate is filled into containers, followed by nitrogen blanketing and the filled containers sealed; and the said filtrate in the sealed containers is sterilised by autoclaving.<br>

of the present invention is described below:<br>
i)	preparing oil phase in triglyceride oil maintained at about 75 Â°C, by adding<br>
Propofol; ii)       preparing an aqueous phase in water at about 70Â°C; by adding glycerol and<br>
sodium hydroxide solution to make it alkaline; iii)       adding the emulsifier and individual ingredients of the preservative system<br>
of claim 1 in the oil phase either totally or partly and adding the remaining<br>
in the aqueous phase;<br>
18<br><br>
iv)       adding said oily phase obtained at step i) to said aqueous phase obtained at<br>
step ii) under stirring to produce a coarse emulsion;<br>
 v)        homogenizing the said coarse emulsion obtained at step iv) to an average<br>
globule size of less than 500 nanometers;<br>
vi)	filtering the said composition obtained at the end of step v); <br>
vii)      filling the said filtrate obtained at the end of step vi) in containers such as<br>
vials,   ampoules,   under   nitrogen   blanketing   and   sealing   the   filled<br>
containers; <br>
viii)     sterilising said filtrate in said sealed containers by autoclaving.<br>
Another process  for the preparation of the Propofol  oil-in-water emulsion<br>
