HYBRID POWER-SAVING MECHANISM FOR VoIP SERVICES<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of the Provisional Application, filed on November 7, 2006, Serial No. 60/857,527, titled, "Hybrid Power-Saving Mechanism for VoIP Services".<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the invention relate to Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) power-saving systems. In particular, embodiments of the invention are related to Mobile WiMAX systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[0003] Current enhanced voice codecs, such as G.723.1 A, G.729B, and 3GPP Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR), can use a silence suppression scheme that prevents voice packets from being transmitted during silent periods in order to eliminate wasted bandwidth. Statistically silent periods occupy about 60 percent of the total duration of a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call. Therefore the mobile station (MS) can save more energy if it can sleep during those periods. However, the conventional Power Saving Class (PSC) II used for VoIP services does not consider the silent periods of VoIP traffic, so the MS must wake up periodically during the silent periods even though it receives no voice packets.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

A second PSC mode is entered when at least one of the DL and UL statuses indicates a talk period.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] An embodiment of the invention is a technique for power saving in mobile communication. At least one of a base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) is initialized for power saving using a downlink (DL) status and an uplink (UL) status associated with the BS and the MS, respectively, during communication between the BS and the MS. A first PSC mode is entered when both the DL and UL statuses indicate a silence period. A second PSC mode is entered when at least one of the DL and UL statuses mdicates a talk period.<br>
[0023] In the follovwng description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures, and techniques have not been shown in order not to obscure the understanding of this descripfion.<br>
[0024] One embodiment of the invention may be described as a process which is usually depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed. A process may correspond to a method, a program, a procedure, a method of manufacturing or fabrication, etc.<br>
[0025] Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating a system 100 according to one embodhnent of the invention. The system 100 includes a base station (BS) 110 and N mobile stations (MSs) 140i to 140N. Note that the system 100 may include more or less than the above components.<br>
[0026] The BS 110 is a station installed at a fixed or mobile location to communicate with the N MSs 140i to 140N in a wireless communication mode via radio fi-equency (RF) transmission. The wireless communication may conform to a Worldvdde Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) standard. The location may be at a sparsely or densely populated area, or may be for vehicular uses. The BS 110 includes a BS processing unit 120 and a BS transmitter/receiver 130.<br>
[0027] The BS processing unit 120 includes necessary components for BS operations. It may include an oscillator to provide clock sources or signals to various components in<br>
 <br>
the unit, such as analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and other logic circuits; one or more processors such as digital signal processor (DSP), to perform various functions or execute programs; automatic gain control (AGC), automatic frequency control (AFC), and channel encoding/decoding modules or circuits, etc. The BS processing unit includes a BS power saving hybrid controller 125 to provide power saving control features to the BS 110.<br>
[0028] The BS transmitter/receiver 130 may include transmitting unit and receiving unit to transmit and receive RF signals. It may include a high powered antenna. The antenna may be mounted on a rooftop, tower, or hilltop depending on the type or terrain and the desired coverage area.<br>
[0029] The N MSs 140i to 140N may include any MS device such as a handset, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a notebook computer, a laptop computer, or any device that is capable of performing MS fimctionality in a wireless communication network. Each of the N MSs 140i to 140N may subscribe for mobile communication services provided by the BS 110. Each of the N MSs 140i to 140N may include a radio frequency (RF) receiver to receive a radio signal carrying a sequence of symbols from the BS 110 in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless communication, a power saving hybrid controller 145i (i = 1, ..., N), a frame detection and synchronizer, a cyclic prefix (CP) remover to remove the CP, a fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor to compute the FFT, a channel equalizer, a channel estimator, a decoder, a de-interleaver, and other circuits or modules to perform receiving functions.   Each of the N MSs 140| to 140N may also include channel coder and interleaver. Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) mapper, inverse FFT (IFFT) processor, cyclic prefix and windowing processing unit, and RF transmitter, and other circuits or modules to perform transmitting functions.<br>
[0030] The BS 110 and the N MSs 140i to 140N communicate with one another imder a predefined communication protocol or standard. In one embodiment, the communication standard is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e standard or European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) High Performance Radio Metropolitan Area Network (HiperMAN) 1.3.2 standard. The BS power saving hybrid controller 125 and the MS power saving hybrid controllers 145i's provide an efficient power saving using a hybrid scheme that combines several power saving class modes provided by the IEEE 802.16e standard. The BS 110 and the N MSs<br>
 <br>
140I to 140N may include Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical layer (PHY) features in a typical WiMAX system. The Mobile WiMAX system uses the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme for multi-path environments. It may provide VoIP services and a power saving mode (PSM). The hybrid power saving scheme employed by the BS 110 or any one of the N MSs 140i to 140N combines a first PSM and a second PSM<br>
[0031] Figure 2 is a timing diagram 200 illustrating a first power saving mode (PSM) according to one embodmient of the invention. The timing diagram 200 includes a wake mode 210 and a sleep mode 220.<br>
[0032] The wake mode 210 corresponds to an active period where the BS 110 or the MS 140 performs its normal functions such as transmitting or receiving communication packets to and/or from the other device.   The sleep mode 220 corresponds to a power saving period where the BS or the MS 140 reduces its power consumption. The sleep mode 220 may include a number of sleep cycles 230i' s (i = 1, ..., K). Each sleep cycle includes a sleep interval or window 240; and a listening interval or window 250;. For brevity, in the following the subscript "i" may be dropped. There are three parameters used by the first PSM: an initial or minimum sleep time (Tmin), a final or maximum sleep time (Tmax), and a listening time (TL). These parameters are typically pre-negotiated with the other device during the initial period or at the beginning of their communication.<br>
[0033] During the sleep interval 240, the BS 110 or the MS 140 turns off most of the circuit elements to reduce power consumption. This results in longer operational period and increase battery life. During the sleep interval 240, the BS 110 or the MS 140 may not receive or transmit any data. During the listening interval 250, the BS 110 or the MS 140 synchronizes with the MS 140 or the BS 110, respectively, to receive short data or a traffic indication message.<br>
[0034] At the beginning of the sleep mode, during the initial sleep cycle 230i, the sleep time interval Ti 240i is equal to the minimum sleep time Tmin, i.e., Ti = Tmin. The length of the sleep time interval Ti increases binary exponentially until it approaches, but does not exceed the final, or maximum, sleep tune Tmax- When the final, or maximum, sleep time Tmax is reached, the device maintains the sleep time at this Tmax<br>
 <br>
value. In other words, the sleep time interval in the i-th sleep cycle 230i is given by the following;<br>
 <br>
Z =<br>
 <br>
<br>
max<br>
71„	Otherwise<br>
 <br>
(1)<br>
 <br>
0035] In one embodiment, the sleep time interval in the i-th sleep cycle 230i is Tiodified slightly from (1) as follows:<br>
1    ^max+^L	Otherwise<br>
[0036] During the listening interval 250, the BS 110 or the MS 140 wakes up for a time ;qual to the listening time TL- The listening time TL is constant throughout the sleep node 220. It may be a short interval of about one MAC frame length. During the istening interval 250, the device (i.e., the BS 100 or the MS 140) listens to the traffic indication transmitted from the other device. For example, the MS 140 listens to determine if a traffic indication message 265 is broadcast from the BS 110. If this message delivers a positive indication, the device exits the sleep mode 220 and returns to the wake mode 210 to receive the buffered packet from the other device.<br>
[0037] The first PSM may be suitable for non real-time traffic with bursty behavior such as Web browsing. It may be used to support a best effort (BE) or a non real-time variable rate (NRT-VR) connection. In one embodiment, it is compatible with the PSM protocol of the power saving class (PSC) Type I provided by the IEEE 802.16e standard.<br>
[0038] Figure 3 is a timing diagram 300 illustrating a second power saving mode (PSM) according to one embodiment of the invention. The timing diagram 300 includes a wake mode 310 and a sleep mode 320. The wake mode 310 and the sleep mode 320 are similar to the wake mode 210 and the sleep mode 220 shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0039] The wake mode 310 corresponds to an active period where the BS 110 or the MS 140 performs its normal functions such as transmitting or receiving communication packets to and/or from the other device.   The sleep mode 320 corresponds to a power saving period where the BS or the MS 140 reduces its power consumption. The sleep mode 320 may include a number of sleep cycles 330i's (i = 1, ..., K). Each sleep cycle<br>
 <br>
includes a sleep mterval or window 340i and a listening interval or window 350i. For brevity, in the following the subscript "i" may be dropped. There are two parameters used by the second PSM: an initial or minimum sleep time (Tmin) and a listening time (TL). These parameters are typically pre-negotiated with the other device during the initial period or at the beginning of their communication. The initial sleep time Tmin and the listening time TL are constant throughout the sleep cycles in the sleep mode 320.<br>
[0040] During the sleep interval 340, the BS 110 or the MS 140 turns off most of the cncuit elements to reduce power consumption. This results m longer operational period and increase battery life. During the sleep mterval 340, the BS 110 or the MS 140 may not receive or transmit any data.<br>
[0041] During the listening mterval 350, the BS 110 or the MS 140 wakes up for a time equal to the listening time TL. The listening time TL is constant throughout the sleep mode 220. Itmay be a short interval of about one MAC frame length. During the Ustening mterval 350, the device (i.e., the BS 100 or the MS 140) does not transmit the traffic indication message. Instead, the BS 110 and the MS 140 directly exchange with each other their real-time packets 360. Therefore, the sleep mode 320 may be maintained uninterrupted, which is more efficient for real-time traffic because the signal overhead required to restart the sleep mode may be eliminated or reduced significantly. In the second PSM, the sleep mode 320 may be ended as desired by the BS 110 or the MS 140 by sending a specified control message.<br>
[0042] The second PSM may be suitable for real-time traffic such as VoIP. It may be used to support an unsolicited grant service (UGS), a real-time variable rate (RT-VR), or an extended real-time variable rate (ERT-VR) connection. In one embodiment, it is compatible with the PSM protocol of the power saving class (PSC) Type II provided by the IEEE 802.16e standard.<br>
[0043] Figure 4 is a timing diagram 400 illustrating a hybrid power saving mode according to one embodiment of the invention. The timmg diagram 400 illustrates the MS state for illustrative purposes. A similar diagram may be obtained for the BS state. The timmg diagram 400 includes a timing diagram for the BS packet in a downlink (DL) transmission, a timing diagram for the MS packets in an uplink (UL) transmission, and a tuning diagram for the MS state. The diagrams show voice packets 430, no<br>
 <br>
packet 440, silence insertion descriptor (SID) frame 450, sleep interval S 460, and listening interval L 470.<br>
[0044] The voice packet 430 is generated when a station sends a packet containing a voice communication. The voice codecs of the end users may use a silence suppression scheme. In this scheme, the voice packets 430 are generated periodically during the talk-spurt periods, but are not generated at all during silent periods. At the beginning of a silent period, the voice codec using the silence suppression scheme inserts the SID frame 450. The SID frame 450 is smaller than the voice packet 430. It may include only information about background noise. It may be used to generate artificial noise at the receiving side's decoder during the silent period.<br>
[0045] The hybrid power saving mode (HPSM) uses both the first and second PSMs depending on whether there is a mutual silent period 480. A mutual silent period is a period during which both the UL device (e.g., the MS) and the DL device (e.g., the BS) have no voice packets to transmit. In other words, if the silent suppression scheme is used, the mutual silent period 480 may be detected if both the UL device and the DL device transmit their SID frame.<br>
[0046] When there is at least a voice packet 430 on DL or UL or both, the HPSM follows the PSM protocol of the second PSM 410 (e.g., the PSC type II). In other words, the station sleeps during the sleep interval 460 with a fixed length Ts, and wakes up during the listening interval 470 with a fixed length TL during which a voice packet 430 may be generated. The sleep cycle Tp is equal to Ts + TL.<br>
[0047] During the mutual silent period 480, there is no transmission of voice packets 430. The station applies the PSM protocol of the first PSM 420 (e.g., the PSC type I). In other words, if Tj is the length of the i-th sleep interval 465, then the length of the i-th sleep cycle, Ti+Tt, increases exponentially as given in equation (2), repeated below for ease of reference:<br>
 <br>
;   ' -*/.<br>
 <br>
7;ax + ^.	Otherwise<br>
 <br>
where Tmax is the maximum sleep cycle. The minimum or mitial sleep cycle is equal to Tp.<br>
 <br>
[0048] Note that the first PSM is modified slightly from the PSC Type I, as shown in equation (2), in that the value of the sleep cycle, Ti+TL, is doubled to synchronize with the arrival of the voice packet 430 although only Ti value is doubled in the original PSC Type I.<br>
[0049] When the mutual silence period 480 starts, the PSM switches from the second PSM 410 to the first PSM 420. The start of the mutual silence period 480 may be detected by detecting two SID frames coming from the two commimicating stations. Each of the BS 110 and the MS 140 may detect if an arriving packet is a SID frame by checking the packet size because the SID frame 450 has much few bits than the voice packet 430.<br>
[0050] When a station is m the first PSM 420, it continuously checks for an arriving packet, either from UL or DL, during the listening interval 470. If the packet is the voice packet 430, the station terminates the first PSM 420 and returns to the second PSM 410. If the packet is the SID fi-ame 450, which may be sent by a station, the station waits for the next listening interval 470 and sends the received SID fi-ame 450. In this manner, the arrival of a SID frame 450 during the mutual silence period 480 does not interrupt the operation of the first PSM 420, resulting in a more power efficient operation.<br>
[0051] If a voice packet 430 arrives during the sleep interval 465 while the station is in the first PSM 420, it is buffered in a buffer memory and is then forwarded in the next listening interval 470. More than one packet may be buffered and transmitted in the next listening interval 470. In this manner, all buffered packets may be transmitted first to reduce unnecessary buffering delay.<br>
[0052] To facilitate the control action that switches the station between the second PSM 410 and the first PSM 420, the station may maintain two status variables or flags that indicate the status of the DL and the UL. The status of the DL and the UL refers to whether a voice packet or an SID frame has been received or transmitted. By checking the DL and UL statuses, the station may detect the mutual silence period 480. A simple rule is that if both the DL and UL statuses indicate that there is a silence period (e.g., when both the BS 110 and MS 140 receive then- respective SID frame 450), then the mutual silence period 480 is detected and the PSM associated with the underlying station is the first PSM 420. Otherwise, if at least one of the DL and UL statuses<br>
 <br>
indicates that there is a talk period (e.g., when at least one of the BS 110 and MS 140 receives a voice packet 430), then there is no mutual silence period and the PSM associated with the underlying station is the second PSM 410.<br>
[0053] The HPSM may be started by first initializing the DL and UL statuses to a talk status that indicates a talk period. In this way, the second PSM 410 is PSM of the station when the station begins its power saving operation. From this initial second PSM 410, the station may remains in the second PSM 410 or switches to the first PSM 420 according to the DL and UL statuses as discussed above.<br>
[0054] Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating the power saving hybrid controller 125/145i shown in Figure 1 according to one embodiment of the invention. The hybrid controller 125/145i includes an initializer 510, a first controller 540, a second controller 560, and a packet receiver/transmitter 580. The hybrid controller 125/145; may have more or less components than the above. In addition, the hybrid controller 125/145i may be implemented by hardware, firmware, software or any combination of them.<br>
[0055] The initializer 510 initializes at least one of a BS 110 and a MS 140 for power saving using a DL status 520 and an UL status 530 associated with the BS 110 and the MS 140, respectively, during communication between the BS 110 and the MS 140. The DL status 520 and the UL status 530 may be stored in a memory which may be accessible to the initializer 510, the first controller 540, and the second controller 560.<br>
[0056] The initializer 510 sets both the DL and the UL statuses to indicate the talk period if both a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and power-saving mode (PSM) are desired<br>
[0057] The fu-st controller 540 is coupled to the mitializer 510 to activate a first power-saving class (PSC) mode 550 when both the DL and UL statuses indicate a silence period. Activating the fu-st PSC mode 550 includes mamtaining the scheduling of the sleep interval and the listening interval according to the first PSM as discussed above. The first PSC mode 550 may be represented by a timing circuit or a routine that performs the scheduling.<br>
[0058] The second controller 560 is coupled to the initializer 510 to activate a second PSC mode 570 when at least one of the DL and UL statuses mdicates a talk period. Activating the second PSC mode 570 includes maintaining the scheduling of the sleep<br>
 <br>
interval and the listening interval according to the second PSM as discussed above. The second PSC mode 570 may be represented by a timing circuit or a routine that performs the scheduling.<br>
[0059] The packet receiver/transmitter 580 performs the receiving and transmitting , fimctions of a SID frame or a voice packet. It may also check whether a packet is a voice packet or a SID frame and inform the first controller 540 or the second controller 560 accordingly.<br>
[0060] Figure 6A is a diagram illustrating the first controller 540 shown in Figure 5 according to one embodiment of the invention.   The first controller 540 includes a . maintaining module 610 and an updater 620. The first controller 540 may have more or less components than the above.<br>
[0061] The maintaining module 610 maintains a sleep interval and a listening interval according to a first PSM protocol 615 if both the DL and UL statuses 520 and 530 (Figure 5) indicate the silence period. In one embodiment, the first PSM protocol 615 is the protocol of the PSC Type I as provided by the IEEE 802.16e or an equivalent standard. The maintaining module 610 also communicates with the second controller 560 if it is determined that the PSM is changed from the first PSM to the second PSM, in which case the maintaining module 610 de-activates the first PSM protocol 615.<br>
[0062] The updater 620 updates at least one of the DL and UL statuses 520 and 530. This may be performed by monitoring or determining the type of packet as provided by the packet receiver/transmitter 580 (Figure 5). The updater 620 includes a status updater 650, a buffer 630, and a transmitter 640.<br>
[0063] The status updater 650 updates one of the DL and UL statuses 520 and 530 at the BS 110 or at the MS 140 if a voice packet is received or transmitted. The buffer 630 buffers a silence insertion descriptor (SID) frame or a voice packet. The buffer 630 may be implemented as a buffer memory (e.g., first-in-first-out device, random access memory). The size of the buffer 630 may be large enough to hold all the packets that may arrive. The transmitter 640 transmits the buffered SID frame or the buffered voice packet during the listening interval. The transmitter 640 sends the buffered SID frame or the buffered voice packet to the packet receiver/transmitter 580.<br>
 <br>
[0064] Figure 6B is a diagram illustrating the second controller 560 shown in Figure 5 accordmg to one embodiment of the invention. The second controller 560 includes a maintaining module 660 and an updater 670. The second controller 560 may have more or less than the above components.<br>
[0065] The maintaining module 660 maintains a sleep interval and a listening interval according to a second PSM protocol 665 if at least one of the DL and UL statuses indicates the talk period. In one embodiment, the second PSM protocol 665 is the protocol of the PSC Type II as provided by the IEEE 802.16e or an equivalent standard. The maintaining module 660 also communicates with the first controller 540 if it is determined that the PSM is changed from the second PSM to the first PSM, in which case the maintaining module 660 de-activates the second PSM protocol 665.<br>
[0066] The updater 670 updates at least one of the DL and UL statuses 530 and 530 (Figure 5). This may be performed by monitoring or determining the type of packet as provided by the packet receiver/transmitter 580 (Figure 5).<br>
[0067] Figure 7 is a flowchart to illustrate a process 700 to save power according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0068] Upon START, the process 700 initializes at least one of a BS and a MS for power saving using a DL status and an UL status associated with the BS and the MS, respectively, during communication between the BS and the MS (Block 710). Next, the process 700 determines if both the DL and UL statuses indicate a silence period (Block 720). If so, the process 700 enters a first PSC mode (Block 730) and is then terminated. Otherwise, the process 700 enters the second PSC mode and is then terminated. In one embodiment, the first PSC mode supports a best effort (BE) or a non real-time variable rate (NRT-VR) connection and the second PSC mode supports an unsolicited grant service (UGS), a real-time variable rate (RT-VR), or an extended real-time variable rate (ERT-VR) connection. In one embodiment, the first PSC mode corresponds to a PSC type I and the second PSC mode corresponds to a PSC type II according to an IEEE 802.16e or an equivalent standard.<br>
[0069] Figure 8 is a flowchart to illustrate the process 710 shown in Figure 7 to initialize according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
 <br>
[0070] Upon START, the process 710 determines if a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is desired (Block 810). If not, the process 710 returns to Block 810. Otherwise, the process 710 determines if power-saving mode (PSM) is desired (Block 820). If not, the process 710 returns to Block 810 (or Block 820). Otherwise, the process 710 sets both the DL and the UL statuses to indicate the talk period (Block 830) and is then terminated.<br>
[0071] Figure 9A is a flowchart to illustrate the process 730 shown in Figure 7 to enter the first PSC mode according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0072] Upon START, the process 730 maintains a sleep interval and a listening interval according to a first PSM protocol (Block 910). Then, the process 730 updates at least one of the DL and UL statuses (Block 920). Next, the process 730 determines if both the DL and UL statuses indicate a silence period (Block 930). If so, the process 730 returns to Block 910 to continue maintaining the sleep interval and the listening interval according to maintaining the first PSM protocol. Otherwise, if at least one of the DL and UL statuses indicates a talk period, the process 730 exits the first PSC mode to enter the second PSG mode (Block 940) and is then terminated.<br>
[0073] Figure 9B is a flowchart to illustrate the process 920 shown in Figure 9A to update one of the DL and UL statuses in the first PSC mode according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0074] Upon START, the process 920 determines if a packet is received or transmitted (Block 945). If not, the process 920 is terminated; i.e., no updating of the DL or UL status is necessary. Otherwise, the process 920 buffers the packet which may be a silence insertion descriptor (SID) frame or a voice packet (Block 950). Next, the process 920 determines if the packet is a voice packet (Block 960). If not, i.e., the packet is an SID frame, the process 920 goes to Block 970. Otherwise, the process 920 determines if the packet is from a DL station or an UL station (Block 962). If it is a DL station, i.e., the BS station, the process 920 sets the DL status to a talk status to indicate the talk period (Block 964) and goes to Block 970. If it is an UL station, i.e., the MS station, the process 920 sets the UL status to the talk status (Block 966) and goes to Block 970.<br>
 <br>
[0075] The process 920 then determines if the listening interval has been reached (Block 970). If not, the process 920 is terminated. Otherwise, the process 920 transmits the buffered SID frame or frames or the buffered voice packet or packets during the listening interval (Block 980) and is then terminated.<br>
[0076] Figure 10 is a flowchart to illustrate the process 740 shown in Figure 7 to enter the second PSC mode according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0077] Upon START, the process 740 maintains a sleep interval and a listening interval according to a second PSM protocol (Block 1010). Then, the process 740 updating at least one of the DL and UL statuses (Block 1020). Next, the process 740 determines if both the DL and UL statuses indicate a silence period (Block 1030). If not, i.e., if at least one of the DL and UL statuses indicates the talk period, the process 740 returns to Block 1010 to continue maintaining the sleep interval and the listening interval according to the second PSM protocol. Otherwise, the process 740 exits the second PSC mode to enter the first PSC mode and is then terminated.<br>
[0078] Figure 11 is a flowchart to illustrate the process 1020 shown in Figure 10 to update one of the DL and UL statuses in the second PSC mode according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0079] Upon START, the process 1020 determines if the station is the BS or the MS (Block 1110). If it is the BS, the process 1020 updates one of the DL and UL statuses at the BS (Block 1120) and is then terminated. If it is the MS, the process 1020 updates one of the DL and UL statuses at the MS (Block 1130) and is then terminated.<br>
[0080] Figure 12 is a flowchart to illustrate the process 1120 shown in Figure 11 to update one of the DL and UL statuses m the second PSC mode at the BS according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0081] Upon START, the process 1120 determmes if the packet is an SID firame or a voice packet (Block 1210). If it is an SID frame, the process 1120 determines if the packet is transmitted or received to or from the MS (Block 1220). If it is transmitted to the MS, the process 1120 sets the DL status to a silence status to indicate the silence period (Block 1230) and is then terminated. If it is received from the MS, the process 1120 sets the UL status to the silence status (Block 1240) and is then terminated.<br>
 <br>
[0082] If the packet is a voice packet, the process 1120 determines if it is transmitted to the MS or received from the MS (Block 1250). If it is transmitted to the MS, the process 1120 sets the DL status to a talk status to indicate the talk period and is then terminated. If it is received from the MS, the process 1120 sets the UL status to the talk status and is then terminated.<br>
[0083] Figure 13 is a flowchart to illustrate the process 1130 shown in Figure 11 to update one of the DL and UL statuses in the second PSC mode at the MS according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0084] Upon START, the process 1130 determines if the packet is a SID frame or a voice packet (Block 1310). If it is a SID frame, the process 1130 determines if it is transmitted to the BS or received from the BS (Block 1320). If it is transmitted to the BS, the process 1130 sets the UL status to a silence status to indicate the silence period (Block 1330) and is then terminated. If it is received from the BS, the process 1130 sets the DL status to the silence status (Block 1340) and is then terminated.<br>
[0085] If it is a voice packet, the process 1130 determines if it is transmitted to the BS or received from the BS (Block 1350). If it is transmitted to the BS, the process 1130 sets the UL status to a talk status to indicate the talk period (Block 1360) and is then terminated. If it is received from the BS, the process 1130 sets the DL status to the talk status (Block 1370) and is then terminated.<br>
