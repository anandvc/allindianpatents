				<td>METHOD FOR OPTIMISING THE CONDUCTIVITY PROVIDED BY THE DISPLACEMENT OF H+ PROTONS AND/OR OH- IONS IN A CONDUCTIVE<br>
MEMBRANE<br>
The present invention relates to a method of optimising the conductivity provided by the displacement of H+ protons and/or OH- ions in a conductive membrane.<br>
The ion-conductive ceramic membranes are nowadays under intense investigation to increase their performances; they find particularly interesting applications in the following fields of:<br>
high-temperature water electrolysis for the production of hydrogen,<br>
the manufacture of hydrogen fuel cells,<br>
separation  and  purification  of  hydrogen  and  its isotopes in comparison with carbon-based products.<br>
Today, hydrogen (H2) appears to be a very interesting energetic vector, which should become more and more important for the treatment of, among others, petroleum products, and could eventually favourably replace petroleum and fossil energies, whose stocks will strongly decrease over the next decades. In this perspective, it is, however, necessary to develop efficacious methods for hydrogen preparation.<br>
Although numerous methods have been described for the synthesis of hydrogen from different sources, most of these methods are indeed not well adapted to the massive industrial production of hydrogen.<br>
In this context, it can be mentioned, for example, the synthesis of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. One of the major<br>
problems of this synthetic route is that it produces, as by-products, important quantities of greenhouse gas, such as C02. In fact, currently, to produce 1 ton of hydrogen, 8 to 10 tons of C02 are released.<br>
Methods for thermochemical conversions of water into hydrogen can also be mentioned, most of which cannot be transposed to industrial scale, in particular, the direct thermal decomposition of water, which would require unrealistic temperatures of about 3000 to 4000°K, which can, however, be reduced in the presence of catalysts.<br>
Other types of thermochemical decompositions of water from sulfur, iodide or bromide catalysts require lower temperatures of 850°C but induce severe corrosion problems avoiding their industrialisation.<br>
The most promising route for the industrial production of hydrogen is the technique based on high-temperature steam electrolysis (known as HTE).<br>
At the present time, two embodiments are presented:<br>
the electrolysis using an electrolyte capable of conducting 02" ions and operating at temperatures generally comprised between 750°C and 1000°C illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
the electrolysis using an electrolyte capable of conducting protons and operating at temperatures generally comprised between 400°C and 800°C illustrated in Figure 2. A given electrolyte can be a protonic or ionic 02~ conductor depending on the temperature.<br>
Figure 1 shows in a schematic manner an electrolyser (1) comprising an O2" ion conductive ceramic membrane (2) as an<br>
electrolyte separating an anode (3) and a cathode (4). A potential difference is applied between the anode (3) and the cathode (4) . The H20 steam is reduced on the side of the cathode (4). The steam enters at the cathode (4) and is dissociated to form hydrogen (H2) on the surface of the cathode and 02" ions. The 02" ions migrate through the electrolyte (2) to form oxygen (02) on the surface of the anode 3, with electrons (e~) being released. On one side, oxygen is collected at the output of the electrolyser (1) and on the other side, hydrogen is collected, mixed with the rest of the steam.<br>
Figure 2 shows in a schematic manner an electrolyser (10) comprising a proton-conductive ceramic membrane (11) as an electrolyte separating an anode (12) and a cathode (13) . A potential difference is applied between the anode (12) and the cathode (13) . The H20 steam is electrolysed along the electrolyte (11) on the side of the anode (12) . The steam enters at the anode (12) and is oxidised to form oxygen (02) and H+ ions; with this reaction releasing electrons (e~ ). The H+ ions cross the electrolyte (11) to form hydrogen (H2) on the surface of the cathode (13) . On one side, hydrogen is then collected at the output of the electrolyser (10) and on the other side oxygen is collected, mixed with the rest of the steam.<br>
The proton-conductive electrolysis, such as the one illustrated in Figure 2, shows two incontestable advantages compared to the O2" ion-conductive electrolysis:<br>
a lower operating temperature allowing for the use of commercial structural materials without any problem of corrosion,<br>
a high purity hydrogen production, as hydrogen is collected at the cathode with no need to separate it<br>
from  water  unlike  for  the  02"  ion-conductive electrolysis.<br>
These two advantages permit to reduce the cost of hydrogen production, thanks to a reduction in the cost of the installation.<br>
However, this type of electrolysis is still in development at the laboratory level.<br>
The objective of these studies is to obtain the maximum yield for the production of hydrogen. For that, the majority of used current needs to take place in the faraidic process, i.e. it needs to be used for the reduction of water and, therefore, for the production of hydrogen. For instance, the voltage used for the polarisation must be affected at least by<br>
overvoltage at the electrodes<br>
contact  resistances  on  the  electrode/electrolyte interfaces,<br>
ohmic drop within materials, in particular inside the electrolyte.<br>
In this context, the present invention is aimed at providing a method for optimising the conductivity of an ion-conductive membrane permitting the limitation of the ohmic drop within said membrane, which can be used in particular as an electrolyte for high-temperature water electrolysis for the production of hydrogen but also to manufacture hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen purification devices.<br>
In this purpose, the present invention provides a method for  optimising  the  conductivity  provided  by  the<br>
displacement of H+ protons and/or OH- ions in a conductive membrane made of a material permitting the insertion of steam into said membrane, wherein said method comprises the step of inserting under pressure gaseous flow containing steam in said membrane in order to force said steam into said membrane under a certain partial pressure so as to obtain the desired conductivity at a given temperature, said partial pressure being higher than or equal to 1 bar, with a drop in the operational temperature being compensated by an increase in said partial pressure in order to obtain the same desired conductivity.<br>
By material permitting the insertion of steam into said membrane, it means a material capable of providing the adsorption and/or the absorption of steam into said membrane.<br>
By gaseous flow containing the steam, it means a medium comprising water as vapour, eventually mixed with other gases. For instance, depending on the case, the term "partial pressure" will indicate either the total pressure of the gaseous flow in the case where this last one consists only of steam or the partial pressure of the steam in the case where the gaseous flow comprises other gases than steam.<br>
Thanks to the present invention, the steam is forced under pressure into the membrane and this pressure is advantageously used to obtain the desired conductivity at a given temperature. As described below in reference to the figures, the applicant has observed that the increase of the partial pressure of the steam causes an increase in ion conductivity in the membrane. This correlation between the increase of partial pressure and the increase of conductivity allows working with materials operating at lower temperatures, with the reduction of conductivity due<br>
to an operation at a lower temperature being balanced by the increase of the partial pressure of the steam.<br>
The method according to the present invention can	also show<br>
one or more of the following characteristics,	taken in<br>
isolation or according to any technically	possible<br>
combination.<br>
Preferably, the partial pressure of the steam is comprised between 1 bar and 100 bars; preferably the partial pressure is higher or equal to 10 bars and lower or equal to 100 bars and more preferably higher or equal to 15 bars.<br>
Advantageously, the temperature is above 400 °C.<br>
Advantageously, the ion conductivity is higher or equal to 10"3 S/m.<br>
Advantageously, the material used in the present invention is impermeable to 02 and H2 gases.<br>
Advantageously, the material used in the present invention is a material having a level of densification above 88% and preferably higher or equal to 98%. It is advisable to find a compromise between the level of densification, which should be as high as possible (notably for the mechanical resistance of the electrolytes and the gas permeation) and the material capacity to permit the insertion of water. The increase in partial pressure of the steam, which forces the steam into the membrane, compensates for the level of densification increase.<br>
According to one particularly advantageous embodiment, the material permitting the insertion of water is an oxygen-defective oxide, such as an oxygen-defective perovskite acting as a proton conductor.<br>
Advantageously, the oxygen-defective oxide shows stoichiometric intervals and/or is doped.<br>
In fact, non-stoichiometry and/or doping allow the creation of oxygen vacancies. For instance, in the case of proton conduction, the exposition under pressure of a perovskite showing stoichiometric intervals and/or being doped (and so being defective in oxygen), to the water pressure, induces the absorption of water molecules in the structure. The water molecules fill the oxygen vacancies and dissociate in 2 hydroxyl groups according to the following reaction:<br>
o	o	2	o<br>
Materials referred to as perovskite are the following ones.<br>
Simple perovskites, which can be represented by a cubic structure such as the one illustrated in Figure 3; the chemical formula is AB03. The oxidation states of the elements contained in the perovskites are in the range of +1 to +3 for A, +2 to +5 for B, as shown below in the Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Constitutive elements of an AB03 structure in the absence of doping element<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
It is generally accepted that the oxidation states +2 for A, +4 for B and -2 for 0. Another common form of perovskites  is  the  orthorhombic  form.  This  structure<br>
derives from the cubic structure by temperature effects. There are 3 important families where the B element is tetravalent:<br>
o   perovskites of cerate types (where B=Ce) having the general formula ACe03;<br>
o   perovskites  of  zirconate  types  (where  B=Zr) having the general formula AZr03;<br>
o   perovskites of titanate types (where B=Ti) having the general formula ATi03;<br>
o   tantalates and niobates can also be mentioned.<br>
Apart from AB03, there are other perovskite structures. Double perovskites A2BB'06 (with B having an oxidation state of +3 and B' an oxidation state of + 5) and triple perovskites A3BB'209 (with B having an oxidation state of +2 and B' an oxidation state of +5) can be mentioned, whose characteristic is to contain on the B sites, some elements of different stoichiometry. Those structures show some deviations compared to the simple perovskites due to the stoichiometric intervals. For instance, one can observe a modification of the geometry of the octahedrons B06 or see appearing the formation of oxygen vacancies due to steric hindrance. These structural modifications could influence the proton conduction, notably, if the ability of the hydrogen ions as H+(H20) and OH" to migrate from one octahedral network to another one is observed.<br>
Perovskites can be doped either on the A site or on the B site by an element referred to as D, advantageously selected from lanthanides Ln or certain metals, alkaline or alkaline earth elements.<br>
The doping element D is preferably ytterbium (Yb) at its oxidation state +III. In fact, Yb3+ has the particularity to have an ionic radius close to the one of Zr4+. Ytterbium III is very effectively substituted by zirconium IV in the perovskite structure, thus leading to the efficacious formation of oxygen vacancies.<br>
Non-stoichiometric perovskites to be used in the present invention have, for example, the following formula: AxBy03, with x and y being two integers other than 1.<br>
Advantageously,<br>
A represents a metallic atom at an oxidation state comprised between +1 and +III, generally at an oxidation state of +11, for example, Ca2+, Ba2+, or Sr2+,<br>
B represents a metallic	atom at an oxidation state<br>
comprised between +III	and  +V,  generally at  an<br>
oxidation state of +IV,	for example, Zr4+, Ce4+, or<br>
Ti4+.<br>
For example, a perovskite to be used in the present invention has the formula SrZro.9Ybo.1O2.95 or BaZro.9Yo.1O2.95 •<br>
As example, other perovskites well adapted to the present invention can be mentioned, but not limited to:<br>
perovskites of SrZr03 types doped by one or more rare earth elements, notably by Y3+, Ho3+, Er3+ and/or Yb3+;<br>
perovskites of BaZr03 types doped by at least one earth element, notably by Yb3+;<br>
perovskites of CaZr03 types doped by at least one earth element, notably by Yb3+;<br>
perovskites of SrTi03 types doped by one or more elements, notably by Al3+, Nb3+, Sc3+;<br>
perovskites of BaTi03 types doped by one or more elements, notably by Al3+,<br>
perovskites of CaTi03 types doped by one or more elements, notably by Al3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Sri-xBaxZr03 types doped by one or more rare earth elements, notably by Yb3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Sri-xCaxZr03 types doped by at least one earth element, notably by Yb3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Cai-xBaxZr03 types doped by at least one earth element, notably by Yb3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Sri-xBaxTi03 types doped notably by Al3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Cai-xSrxTi03 types doped notably by Al3+,<br>
mixed perovskites of Cai.xBaxTi03 types doped notably by Al3+.<br>
It should be noted that materials other than non-stoichiometric and/or doped perovskites can be used as material promoting the insertion of water and its dissociation in the form of protons and/or hydroxides. For example, crystallographic structures, such as fluorite structures, pyrochlore structures A2B2X7, apatite structures Meio (X04) sY2, oxyapatite structures Meio(X04)s02 and hydroxyapatite structures Mei0 (X04) 6 (OH) 2 can be mentioned.<br>
For instance, the pyrochlore structure formed by a tridimensional network of octahedrons (B2X6) contains tunnels, cages and oxygen vacant sites allowing for the migration of ions from water.<br>
Likewise, the compact hexagonal structure consisting of apatite tetrahedrons (X04) induces the formation of tunnels allowing for the mobility of ions and easy substitutions. Water penetrates into those tunnels, and protons can, circulate in them. It should be noted that the apatites can be silicates.<br>
Other families of silicates also need to be taken into consideration.<br>
Aluminosilicates, either as phyllosilicates (clays) or zeolites. The insertion of elements such as Al3+ in the silica network Si4+ makes this network negatively charged. Cations are inserted in this network to compensate the negative charge. Among those cations, the proton is a good candidate. Conductivities vary depending on the water content and on the spacing between sheets. Ions such as ammonium ion NH4+ stabilise this water content at high temperatures. Besides, aluminosilicates keep a high water content at high temperatures (3 00 and 400 °C).<br>
Grafted silicates with oxoacids can also give good results.<br>
Grafted silicates with phosphates can also give some interesting results in almost anhydrous media (20% H20) .<br>
All compounds used as ion conductors at high or intermediate temperatures are, because of their tunnel or<br>
sheet structure and/or the presence of vacancies, capable of inserting water which has a small molecular size.<br>

Figures 14 and 15 represent each, in a simplified and schematic manner, an embodiment of a hydrogen fuel cell using the method of the present invention.<br>
In all the figures, the common elements have the same reference numbers.<br>
Figures 1 and 3 have previously been described in reference to the state of the technique.<br>
Figure 4 represents four ATG-ATD analysis (thermogravimetric analysis coupled to a thermodifferential analysis) a, b, c and d, performed respectively on:<br>
a.	a AB03 type perovskite hydrated with a steam pressure<br>
of 15 bars at 200 °C,<br>
b.	a non-hydrate ABo.9Lno.1O2.95 type perovskite a 200 °C,<br>
c.	a AB0.gLn0.i02.95 type perovskite hydrated with a steam<br>
pressure of 15 bars under N2 atmosphere at 200 °C,<br>
d.	a ABo.9Ln0.i02.95 type perovskite hydrated with a steam<br>
pressure of 15 bars under 02 atmosphere at 2 00 °C.<br>
An ATG-ATD analysis is an analysis allowing for the measurement of weight variation of a sample depending on the temperature.<br>
From graphs a and b, there is no weight loss observed on the perovskites which are:<br>
non-doped (case a), or<br>
non-hydrated under steam pressure (case b).<br>
From graphs c and d, four well marked weight losses are observed depending on the increase of temperature. The temperatures corresponding to those four weight losses are determined by the inflexion points on the graphs c and d and are about 150, 350, 700 and 800 °C, respectively. The<br>
first two weight losses correspond to the loss of water molecules absorbed on the surface of the perovskites. The third and fourth weight losses of about 0.33% correspond to inserted and mobile ionic entity losses in the perovskites, such as H+ or OH" ions. It is interesting to notice that above 800 °C, a weight gain is observed on graph d, corresponding to the sample under 02. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that the vacancies on the perovskite (dehydrated at 800 °C) are filled again by 02" oxide ions; the conduction is then provided by the O2" ions. It should be noted that inflexion points depend, of course, on the material selected and the transition temperature from H+ or OH" conduction to O2" conduction depends on this material.<br>
It should be noted that the perovskites analysed here are perovskites having a level of densification of 88%. The water filling level for the perovskites c and d is 100%. Similar analysis performed on perovskites having a level of densif ication of 98% show a water filling level of 75%. Therefore, it can be noticed that a higher densification (which can be interesting for making electrolytes) slows down the insertion of water into the perovskite (however, the increase in densif ication is not an obstacle to the insertion of water).<br>
In summary, Figure 4 shows that:<br>
the conduction in perovskites:<br>
•	is due to the insertion of water and to the ion mobility (H+ and OH" then 02" at higher temperatures),<br>
•	works preferentially with doped perovskites (or eventually non-stoichiometric ones) in order to form vacancies in the crystallographic structure;<br>
a pressure higher or equal to 15 bars is necessary to obtain a water filling level of 100% in a perovskite densified at 88% and a water filling level of 75% in a perovskite densified at 98%.<br>
Figure 5 represents an ATD-ATG analysis of a sample having a densification close to 100%. This analysis shows that 50 bars of pressure (during 36 hours) are needed to obtain a vacancy filling of 40%.<br>
The method according to the present invention aims at optimising the conductivity of the membrane using advantageously the previous conclusions and forcing the steam into the membrane under a certain pressure in order to obtain the desired conductivity at a given temperature.<br>
Figure 6 represents different Nyquist diagrams obtained with a pellet of SrZro.9Ybo.1O2.95 perovskite densified at 88%, placed in an oven at 400 °C under a continuous argon flow humidified at a pressure below 1 atm. The different diagrams correspond each to a specific time condition during which the argon flow is performed: going from a diagram obtained with a dry pellet, i.e. with zero humidified argon flow duration to a diagram obtained with a pellet having a humidified continuous argon flow duration of t=16h.<br>
The different Nyquist diagrams are obtained by an electrochemical technique of impedance spectroscopy more and more used in the study of materials. The principle of the impedance spectroscopy lies in the application of low sinusoidal voltage overlaid on the nominal voltage and the amplitude and phase shift analysis of the response current. The amplitude voltage / current ratio defines the impedance modulus |z| and the phase shift between the voltage and the current completes the information to give access to real and imaginary parts of complex impedance Z. During the<br>
measures, a fairly large range of frequencies is scanned. The results are shown on a Nyquist diagram Im(Z) depending on Re(Z). The experimental results are correlated to a model, in order to verify their validity.<br>
An enlargement of the Nyquist diagrams for the real part Re(Z) ranging from 0 to 0.4 MQ is illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Each diagram has substantially an arc of circle form; in the first approximation (corresponding to a modelisation of the pellet according to a parallel RC filter), the pellet resistance is given by the diameter of the corresponding circle. Consequently, a reduction of the resistance (and therefore an increase of conductivity) is observed as the humidified argon flow duration increases.<br>
Figure 7 represents different Nyquist diagrams obtained with a pellet of SrZro.9Ybo.1O2.95 perovskite densified at 88%, therefore, identical to the pellet tested in Figure 6, but which has been previously saturated with water in an autoclave (pre-pressurization under 15 bars of water at 200 °C) . Again, this pellet is placed in an oven at 400 °C under a continuous humidified argon flow. The different diagrams correspond each to a specific duration condition during which the argon flow is performed. A reduction of conductivity is observed as the flow duration increases. Therefore, despite a humidified argon flow, the conductivity reduces.<br>
The analysis of Figures 6 and 7 tends to show that the perovskite acts like a "sponge": in the case of Figure 6 , water penetrates in the pellet and the conductivity increases with time; in the case of Figure 7, water leaves the pellet, which is already pre-pressurized and the conductivity reduces with time.<br>
In summary, Figures 6 and 7 show that:<br>
the conductivity increases with the insertion of water (under an argon flow from a dry pellet);<br>
the reversibility of the insertion and the desorption of water with a pellet which acts like a "sponge" between a progressive hydration process (and an increase in conductivity) and a progressive dehydration state (and a reduction in conductivity),<br>
in order to obtain a good conductivity, it is necessary to force under pressure the insertion of water in the pellet.<br>
Figure 8 represents different Nyquist diagrams obtained with a pellet of SrZro.9Ybo.1O2.9a perovskite under different pressures (corresponding to steam pressures of 2, 5 and 10 bars). The measures are performed at 4 00 °C. It is observed that the conductivity increases with pressure.<br>
This behaviour is confirmed by Figure 9 which represents three conductivity graphs depending on the temperature obtained on the pellet of SrZro.9Ybo.1O2.95 perovskite under three different steam pressures, 2, 5 and 10 bars, respectively. Figure 9 clearly illustrates the increase in conductivity with pressure. A conductivity of about 10"3 S/cm is obtained for a pressure of 10 bars at a temperature of about 600 °C. To obtain the same conductivity at 5 bars, a temperature of about 650 °C is required; at 2 bars, the temperature increases to 675 °C. A new pressure increase allows for the obtaining of conductivities higher or equal to 10"2 S/cm. The same comportment has been observed with other perovskites, such as BaZro.9Yo.1O2.95 •<br>
In other words, to obtain a given conductivity, it is possible to work at lower temperatures by increasing the steam pressure in the perovskite. This result shows a<br>
considerable advantage in that it allows avoiding the use of material operating at higher temperatures.<br>
The increase in temperature causes an increase in ion species mobility, providing conductivity but having also the effect of dehydrating the perovskite. The perovskite dehydration is balanced by the maintenance of perovskite under water pressure.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 represent each, in a simplified and schematic manner, an embodiment of a hydrogen production electrolysis device, (20) and (30), respectively, using the method according to the invention.<br>
The electrolysis device (20) in Figure 10 is substantially identical to the device (10) in Figure 2. Therefore, this device (20) comprises:<br>
a proton conductive ceramic membrane (21) made of said material permitting the insertion of steam into said membrane and providing a separating electrolyte function,<br>
an anode (22),<br>
a cathode (23),<br>
a generator (24) imposing a potential difference between the anode (22) and the cathode (23).<br>
The proton-conductive membrane is made of a material promoting the insertion of water, such as a doped perovskite material of general formula ABi.xDx03.x/2 - The materials used for the anode and the cathode are cermets (mixture of metal and perovskite material used for the electrolyte). The membrane is preferably impermeable to 02 and H2 gases.<br>
The device (20) further comprises means (25) permitting the insertion under pressure of water into the membrane (21) via the anode (22) , with the steam pressure being preferably at least above 15 bars, even higher or equal to 50 bars. It is important to mention that the total imposed pressure in the compartment will have to be compensated in the other compartment in order to have a pressure difference between the two compartments of about 10 bars to avoid membrane rupture. Therefore, in Figure 10, the H2 pressure can be increased.<br>
The Tl operating temperature of device (20) depends on the type of material used for the membrane (21) ; in any case, this temperature is above 400 °C and generally below 650 °C, even below 600 °C. This operating temperature corresponds to a conduction provided by H+ protons.<br>
The H20 steam under pressure is oxidised at the anode (22). The steam is dissociated to form oxygen (02) and H+ ions, this reaction releases electrons (e") . The H+ ions cross the electrolyte (21) to form hydrogen (H2) on the surface of the cathode (23).<br>
The use of the method according to the present invention permits notably to increase the H+ ions conductivity.<br>
The electrolysis device (3 0) in Figure 11 has a similar structure than device (20) in Figure 8. It comprises:<br>
an anode (32),<br>
a cathode (33),<br>
an electrolyte (31) as an ion-conductive membrane made of said material permitting the insertion of steam into said membrane ,<br>
a  generator (34)  imposing  a  potential  difference between the anode (32) and the cathode (33),<br>
means (35) permitting the insertion under pressure of water in the membrane (31) via the cathode (33).<br>
The T2 operating temperature of device (3 0) is higher than the Tl operating temperature of device (20) of Figure 10; T2 is generally above 600 °C and below 850 °C, and corresponds to a conductivity provided by OH" ions. Again, the injection of steam under pressure permits notably to increase the conductivity. The injection is performed via means (35) at the cathode (33). At the cathode (33), water is reduced by capturing electrons to form hydrogen. OH" ions cross the electrolyte (31) and are oxidised at the anode (32) to form 02, H20 and electrons. In the same way as for device (20) of Figure 10, it can be necessary to counterbalance pressures.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 represent each, in a simplified and schematic manner, an embodiment of a hydrogen purification device (40) and (50), respectively, using the method according to the present invention.<br>
The purification device (40) in Figure 12, comprises:<br>
a proton filtration membrane (41) made of a material permitting the insertion of steam into the membrane,<br>
means (45) permitting the insertion under pressure of water in the membrane (41) via a feed (42).<br>
The proton filtration membrane (41) is made of a material comprising a mixture of metal and perovskite.<br>
On the side of the feed (42) , a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and impurities (such as C02, CO, CH4 carbon-based products)<br>
is injected under pressure, the function of device (40) being to separate H2 from impurities in order to provide on the permeate side pure hydrogen (H2) . Only H+ protons diffuse by a concentration gradient into the proton membrane (41) towards the permeate output (43) . The metal in the membrane allows for the percolation of electrons towards the permeate output (43); a reduction in protons by electrons is then observed at the permeate output (43) in order to recuperate pure hydrogen.<br>
Means (45) permit the increase of proton conductivity. In the other hand, water pressure on the anodic side will tend to increase the potential Ex on the side of the alimentation (42). In order for the device (40) to work, it is acknowledged that the potential E2 on the permeate side should always be higher than the potential Ei. Consequently, it is advisable to choose a water pressure so that the potential E2 is always higher than Ei-<br>
In Figure 13, the purification device (50), comprises:<br>
an anode (52),<br>
a proton filtration membrane (51) made of said material permitting the insertion of steam into the membrane ,<br>
a cathode (53),<br>
means (55) permitting the insertion under pressure of water in the membrane (51) via the cathode (53),<br>
a generator (54) positively polarising the anode (52) and negatively polarising the cathode (53).<br>
On the side of the anode (52) , a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and non-oxidised impurities (such as, for example, methane)<br>
is injected under pressure, the function of the device being to separate H2 from impurities in order to provide on the side of the cathode (53) pure hydrogen (H2) . Again, the injection of steam under pressure permits the increase of proton conductivity. It should be noted that this device will operate even better if the H2 pressure on the anodic side is high. Moreover, this device (50) can also be used as a hydrogen pump; in other words, it can be used to extract hydrogen from a system (in this case, hydrogen is not necessarily mixed with impurities on the anodic side).<br>
Figures 14 and 15 represent each, in a simplified and schematic manner, an embodiment of a hydrogen fuel cell (60) and (70) , respectively, using the method according to the present invention.<br>
In Figure 14, the hydrogen fuel cell (60) comprises:<br>
an anode (62),<br>
a cathode (63),<br>
a proton-conductive membrane (61) made of said material permitting the insertion of steam into the membrane ,<br>
means (65) permitting the insertion under pressure of water in the electrolyte (61) via the anode (62).<br>
The electrodes (62) and (63) use catalysts to activate on one side the oxidation reaction of hydrogen, and on the other side, the reductive reaction of oxygen. Hydrogen introduced at the anode (62) is dissociated into protons and electrons. The improvement of proton insertion in the membrane (61) (and, therefore, conductivity) is again provided by means (65) permitting the insertion of steam pressure in the electrolyte (61) via the anode (62). At the<br>
cathode (63), oxygen, electrons and protons are recombined to form water.<br>
The water pressure on the anodic side will tend to increase the potential Ei on the anodic side. In order for the cell (60) to work, it is acknowledged that the potential E2 on the cathodic side should always be higher than the potential Ex. Consequently, it is convenient to select the water pressure so that the potential E2 is always higher than Ei. Both water pressures can be identical.<br>
The Tl operating temperature of cell (60) depends on the type of material used for the membrane (61) ; in any case, this temperature is always above 400 °C and generally below 650 °C, even below 600 °C. This operating temperature corresponds to a conduction provided by H+ protons.<br>
In Figure 15, the hydrogen fuel cell (70) comprises:<br>
an anode (72),<br>
a cathode (73),<br>
an electrolyte (71) as an ion-conductive membrane made of said material permitting the insertion of steam into said membrane,<br>
means (75) permitting the insertion under pressure of water in the electrolyte (71) via the cathode (73).<br>
The T2 operating temperature of device (70) is higher than the Tl operating temperature of device (60) in Figure 12 so that the conductivity is provided by the mobility of OH" ions: the conductivity is increased by the injection under pressure of steam by means (75) . The electrodes (72) and 73) use catalysts to activate on the cathodic side the<br>
reaction: l/202 + H20 + 2e → 20H" and on the anodic side, the reaction: H2 + 20H" - 2H20 + 2e~.<br>
Unlike for cell (60), the increase in steam pressure is not limited by the potential difference between the two electrodes and it is, therefore, possible to increase the pressure without limitation in order to increase the conductivity.<br>
In each of the previously described devices, it can be necessary to counterbalance the steam pressure to avoid a ceramic rupture. This counter-pressure will depend on the membrane thickness.<br>
It is evident that the present invention is not limited to this above disclosed embodiment.<br>
In particular, we have mentioned few times the steam pressure but it should be noted that when the steam is part of a gaseous mixture, it should be referred to as partial pressure of steam: it is the increase in partial pressure of steam which increases the conductivity at a given temperature.<br>
Moreover, the above described applications use temperatures higher or equal to 400 °C; however, it should be noted that the operating temperature depends on the material used. Therefore, for example, in the case of aluminosilicates, the operating temperature can be below 4 00 °C (for example, about 300 °C).<br>
Finally, any means can be replaced by an equivalent means.<br>
