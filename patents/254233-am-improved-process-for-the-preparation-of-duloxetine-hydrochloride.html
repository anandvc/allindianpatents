CLAIMS (not applicable for provisional specification. Claims should start with the preambleâ€”--"I/We claim" on separate page)<br>
6.	DATE AND SIGNATURE (to be given at the end of last page of specification)<br>
7.	ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION (to be given along with complete specification on separate page)<br><br>
An improved process for the preparation of<br>
Duloxetine hydrochloride<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Duloxetine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, preferably hydrochloride, which is chemically known as (S)-(+)-N-methyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)-propanamine hydrochloride, represented by formula (I).<br><br>
Duloxetine and related class of compounds like fluoxetine, tomoxetine etc., are important for treating psychiatric disorders. Fluoxetine is selective inhibitor of serotonin in serotonergic neurons, tomoxetine and nisoxetine are selective inhibitors of norepinephrine in noradrenergic neurons while duloxetine is a dual inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reutake and thus have a better pharmacological profile as an antidepressant drug.<br>
Serotonin and norepinephrine neuro transmitters are intimately involved in a number of physiological and behavioral processes, suggesting that duloxetine (ability to produce robust increase of extra cellular serotonin and norepinephrine levels) is not only a highly efficient antidepressant agent for treating psychiatric disorders but also can be used for treating other symptoms like alcoholism, urinary incontinence, fatigue, stroke, intestinal cystitis, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorder, sexual dysfunction etc.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The synthesis of duloxetine is described in detail in EP-A-273 658, EP-A-457 559 and EP-A-650 965. Starting from 2-acetylthiophene, an aminomethylation with dimethylamine and formaldehyde (Mannich reaction) is carried out in step -A. The 3-dimethylamino-1 -(2-thienyl)-1 -propanone formed is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, 1-hydroxy-l-(2-thenyl)-3-dimethylaminopropane, by means of complex hydrides in step B. The alcohol is then converted in step C with an alkali metal hydride and 1-fluoro-naphthalene, optionally in the presence of a potassium compound (cf EP-A-650 965), to the naphthyl derivative, N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-nap hthyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propylamine. In the final step D, the amino group is then demethylated by reaction with a chloroformic acid ester, preferably phenyl chloroformate or trichloroethyl chloroformate, optionally in the presence of a mixture of zinc and formic acid (EP-A-457 559), followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the carbamate to give N-methyl-3-(l-naphthyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propylamine.<br>
The US Patent 5362886 described the process for the preparation of (+) Duloxetine hydrochloride by isolating the (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine phosphoric acid salt and preparation of hydrochloride salt using aqueous hydrochloric acid and ethyl acetate as a solvent.<br>
The US Patent 5023269 claims Duloxetine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and method of treating anxiety and obesity. The patent also discloses the processes for the preparation of Duloxetine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, however the patent not disclosed the process for the preparation of hydrochloride salt.<br>
The EP patent 0650965 Bl discloses the process for the preparation of (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-napththalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine an intermediate of Duloxetine which was isolated as a phosphoric acid salt and disclosed the process for the preparation of Duloxetine hydrochloride using aqueous hydrochloric acid and ethylacetate as a solvent.<br><br>
The US Patent 5491243 and US 5362886 discloses the stereospecific process for the synthesis of (S)-(+)-N1N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine and claimed the same. In both the patents the above said compound isolated as a phosphoric acid salt.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art processes<br>
The US Patent 5362886 describes the process for the preparation of (+) Duloxetine hydrochloride by isolating the (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine as phosphoric acid salt and preparation of hydrochloride salt of Duloxetine using aqueous hydrochloric acid and ethyl acetate as a solvent leads to degradation of the obtained compound.<br>
Isolation	of	(S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-<br>
thienyl)propanamine as phosphoric acid salt leads to one more step and preparation of hydrochloride salt using aqueous hydrochloric acid leads to degradation of the obtained compound and formation of gummy material.<br>
Brief description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of (S)-(+)-N-methyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)-propanamine hydrochloride of formula (I). <br><br>
The present invention comprises of the following steps<br>
a)	Reacting l-(thiophen-2-yl)ethanone compound of formula (II) with dimethylamine hydrochloride compound of formula (III) in presence of paraformaldehyde in a suitable solvent gives the compound of formula (IV).<br>
b)	Reducing the compound of formula (IV) with an alkali metal borohydrides in a suitable solvent gives the compound of formula (V).<br>
c)	Resolving the compound of formula (V) with chiral acid in a suitable solvent and further treating the obtained compound with weak inorganic base in a suitable chloro solvents or ester solvents gives the compound of formula (VI).<br>
d)	Reacting the compound of formula (VI) with the compound of formula (VII) in presence of an alkali base and in a suitable polar aprotic solvent, then in situ demethylation and converting into oxalate salt of compound of formula (VIII).<br>
e)	Converting the Duloxetine oxalate salt into its hydrochloride salt compound of formula (I) using ethylacetate HC1, methanolic HC1, isopropyl alcohol HC1, preferably ethylacetate HC1 in a suitable solvent like alcoholic solvents or ester solvents.<br>
f)	Purifying the above obtained compound of formula (I) from step (e) using suitable solvent or mixture of solvents selected from ester solvents or alcohol solvents or mixture of ester and alcohol solvents.<br>
The process of the present invention is simple, cost effective environment friendly and commercially suitable over the prior art references.<br>
Advantages over prior art processes<br>
â€¢ Usage of ethylacetate HC1 for the preparation of Duloxetine hydrochloride instead of using aqueous hydrochloride for avoiding degradation of Molecule as well as formation of free flow solid.<br><br>
â€¢	As per the present invention the isolation of (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine as phosphoric acid salt is avoided.<br>

methyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propanamine oxalate without isolating intermediate compounds (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propanamine and (S)-(+)-N-phenyloxy carbonyl-N-methyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propanamine thereby reduces two steps in the synthesis of Duloxetine hydrochloride.<br>
â€¢	Present invention provides process for producing Duloxetine hydrochloride substantially free from other isomer (i.e., other isomer is NMT 0.2%).<br>
â€¢	Present invention provides the process for<br>
â€¢	Cost effective process.<br>
â€¢	Reduction of cycle time.<br>
â€¢	Environment friendly and easy scale-up.<br>
