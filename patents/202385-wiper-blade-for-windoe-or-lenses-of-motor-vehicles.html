ROBERT BOSCH GMBH, 70442 Stuttgart<br>
Wiper blade for windows/lenses of motor vehicles<br>
Prior art<br>
The invention proceeds from a wiper blade according to the generic type of Claim 1. In a known wiper blade of this type (DE 2 853 487 Al) , the spring rails bear with their mutually facing longitudinal edges against the base of the respective longitudinal groove - i.e. against the web - and are fixed in this position by claws which belong to frame parts of the wiper blade and which fit around the outer edges of the spring rails. This measure results in a certain stiffening of the web, which can have an adverse effect on the adaptation of the wiper blade to the curvature of the window/lens. Moreover, the abovementioned stiffening of the web causes the wiper strip to tilt over with an undesirably loud noise during the change in the working direction of the wiper blade from its one trailing working position into its other trailing working position.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In the wiper blade according to the invention having the characterizing features of Claim 1, the spring rails can also be displaced transversely to their longitudinal extent in their longitudinal grooves when the web is deformed under an appropriate load. By this means, stiffenings of the web are avoided and better adaptation of the wiper strip to the contour of the window/lens is achieved as is a quieter wiping operation because the noise is bypassed as a result.<br>
In a wiper blade, in which each of the two spring rails protrudes, at least by a section, out of its longitudinal groove, in which case these sections<br><br>
lie opposite each other, with reference to a central longitudinal axis of the wiper strip, and at least on one of these section pairs a component, which reaches over the two spring rails in a bridge-like manner, bears against the mutually remote longitudinal edges of the spring rails, simple installation of the wiper blade arises if at least one securing means which ensures the distance is arranged on the component.<br>
A practical refinement of the invention is provided in that the two spring rails protrude at their two end sections out of their grooves both in the longitudinal direction and transversely to the longitudinal direction of the wiper strip, that a respective end cap, which serves as the bridge-like component, is arranged on these end sections, and that distance-securing means, which interact with the mutually facing longitudinal edges of the spring rails and hold the two ends of the spring rails in the correct position, are arranged on the end cap.<br>
In order to secure the spring rails in their longitudinal grooves, the end cap has a base plate which is arranged on that side of the spring rails which is remote from the wiper lip, and is provided with L-shaped lugs which extend in the longitudinal direction of the spring rails and whose respective L limbs on one side are connected to the base plate and whose respective other L limbs are directed towards each other, and in that distance-securing means which are inserted between the mutually facing longitudinal edges of the spring rails and bear against the latter are arranged on the base plate. This produces a [sic] , between the L limbs on one side and the distance-securing means, a space which is limited towards the web for the spring rails which are able, however, to be displaced both in the longitudinal direction and transversely to the longitudinal extent in this space.<br>
A particularly simple solution for the arrangement of the distance-securing means is produced<br><br>
when the latter are formed by a pin held on the base plate.<br>
Simple installation and simple removal of the wiper blade is produced when the end cap is manufactured from a spring-elastic material and the pin is arranged on a tongue of the end cap, which tongue can be deflected from an operational position into an installation position counter to the restoring force.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the end cap is provided with a wall which is directed against the longitudinal end edges of the spring rails and on which, in the longitudinal direction of the spring rails, distance-securing means which are inserted between the latter are arranged. This refinement of the invention enables automatic installation of the end caps, which can be slid in the longitudinal direction onto the spring rails, because at the same time as these end caps are attached, the distance-securing means also pass into their correct position.<br>
When the these [sic] end caps are manufactured from a spring-elastic material and the distance-securing means are formed by two finger-like lugs of the wall, which lugs can be deflected counter to spring force and, in the operational position of the end cap, bear under tension against one of the two mutually facing longitudinal edges of the spring rails, compensation of the manufacturing tolerances, which cannot be avoided at a justifiable outlay, is obtained at the same time.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the bridge-like component is designed as a connecting device for a wiper arm, which connecting device is arranged in the central section of the wiper blade on that side of the spring rails which is remote from the wiper lip, and is provided with lugs which fit in a claw-like manner around the outer; longitudinal edges of the spring rails, in which case the distance-<br><br>
securing means are formed by means which are arranged on the connecting device and grip into at least one recess of the respective spring rails. It is indeed possible for this refinement to be used by itself, but it can advantageously also be used with the abovementioned embodiments of the invention - use of the correspondingly designed end caps.<br>
In this other embodiment, the distance-securing means are expediently formed by separate structural elements which are held on the connecting device and penetrate the spring rails in recesses provided on them.<br>
In order to secure the end caps on the end sections of the spring rails, on each end section of each spring rail, on their mutually remote longitudinal edges, there is arranged a shoulder which points to the other end section of the said spring rail and which is assigned a mating shoulder, which interacts with it and belongs to the end cap. When the wiper blade is fitted, the shoulder and mating shoulder interact in such a manner that the end caps are held captively on the wiper blade. Since the positioning of the distance-securing means is brought about after the correct position of the end caps has been reached, no problems arise during fitting of the end caps.<br>
Further advantageous developments and refinements of the invention are specified in the following description of exemplary embodiments illustrated in the associated drawing.<br>

Description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
A wiper blade 10 illustrated [lacuna] Figure 1 has a multipart, elongated, spring-elastic supporting element 12. A connecting device 16 is arranged on the upper side of the supporting element 12, which upper side is remote from the window/lens J.4 to be wiped -illustrated by dash-dotted lines in Figure 1- which connecting device can be used to connect the wiper blade 10. detachably to a driven wiper arm 18 which is guided on the body of a motor vehicle. Arranged on. the supporting element 12, on the lower side thereof which faces the window/lens, and parallel to the longitudinal axis is an elongated, rubber-"elastic wiper strip 20.<br><br>
The wiper arm 18 is stressed in the direction of an arrow 22 towards the window/lens to be wiped whose surface to be wiped is provided in Figure 1 with the reference number 24. Since this surface 24 is intended to constitute the greatest curvature of the surface of the window/lens, it is clearly apparent that the curvature of the wiper blade 10, which is still unstressed and bears with its two ends against the window/lens 14, is greater than the maximum curvature of the window/lens. Under the contact pressure (arrow 22) the wiper blade 10 is placed over its entire length with its wiper blade 26 against the surface 24 of the window/lens. This builds up a tension in the band-like, spring-elastic supporting element 12, the said tension ensuring correct bearing of the wiper strip 20, and of the wiper lip 26, over its entire length against the motor-vehicle window/lens 14.<br>
In the following text, more precise details of<br>
9<br>
the special refinement of the wiper blade 10 according to the invention will now be given. As Figures 2 and 3 show in particular, the wiper strip 2 0 of the wiper blade 10 is provided with two longitudinal grooves 28 and 3 0 which are each open at the edge towards the longitudinal sides of the wiper strip 20. The two longitudinal grooves 28 and 30 lie in a common plane -indicated by dash-dotted lines in Figure 3 - which, when the wiper blade 10 is placed onto the window/lens 14, is situated at a distance 33 from the window/lens 14. The two longitudinal grooves 28 and 30 are designed in such a manner that a longitudinal intermediate web 34 remains between them. A spring rail 36 and 38, which is elongated in a band-like manner, is accommodated in each of the two grooves 28 and 28 [sic]. The two spring rails form part of the supporting element 12. They protrude with their two mutually remote longitudinal sides out of their longitudinal grooves 28 and 30. The two spring rails 38 [sic] and 38 are arranged in their longitudinal grooves 28 and 30 in such a manner that<br><br>
their mutually facing longitudinal edges 40 and 42 are located at a distance 44 from each other which is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 34. As Figure 3 further clearly shows, the inner longitudinal edges 40 and 42 of the spring rails 38 [sic] and 38 are thus situated at a certain distance from the intermediate web 34 enabling the said spring rails to also be displaceable transversely to their longitudinal extent in their longitudinal grooves 28, 30.<br>
The refinement of the wiper blade 10 described up to here is found again in all of the special embodiments of the invention which are described in the following. As Figure 4 of a first, special embodiment of the invention shows, the two spring rails 38 [sic] and 38 also protrude, as seen in the direction of their longitudinal extent, out of their longitudinal grooves 28 and 30 of the wiper strip 20. In order for the spring rails 36, 38 to be held captively in their longitudinal grooves 28 and 30, a respective end cap 48 is fitted onto the two end sections of the spring rails or onto the end section of the supporting element 12 (Figures 1 and 2) . As can be seen in particular from Figure 5, the end cap 48 has a base plate 50 which, when the end cap is fitted, is located on that side of the spring rails 36, 38 which is remote from the wiper lip 26. The base plate 50 is provided on its two longitudinal sides 52 with L-shaped lugs 54 which extend in the longitudinal direction of the spring rails 36, 38 and the one L limb 56 of which in each case is connected to the base plate 50 and the other L limbs 58 extend towards each other. As Figure 5 further shows, the two other L limbs 58 grip the spring rails 36 and 38 from below. Thus, in the installation position illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, the end caps 48 hold the spring rails captively in the longitudinal grooves 28 and 30. In order for it not t£&gt; be possible for the end caps to be unintentionally detached from<br><br>
this installation position, their one L limbs 56 each have an aperture 60 into which a respective projection 62 of each spring rail 36, 38 grips, which projection are [sic] arranged in each case on the mutually remote, outer longitudinal edges 64 of the spring rails 36, 38. Formed on each of the two projections 62 is a shoulder 66 which points towards the other end section of the wiper blade 10 and is assigned a mating shoulder, which interacts with it, on the aperture 60 of the end cap 48. In this arrangement, the size of the projections 62 is dimensioned in such a manner that it is smaller than the difference between the two abovementioned dimensions 44 and 46, enabling the end caps 48 to be slid onto the supporting element 12 without any problem. So that the two spring rails 36 and 38 pass back into their correct operating position after the end caps 48 have been installed (Figure 3) and also remain in this operating position during the wiping operation, the end caps 48 are each provided with a separate pin 70 which, after installation of the end cap 48, penetrates the base plate 50 thereof in a hole 72 and extends between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40 and 42 of the spring rails 36 and 38. Since the hole 72 is located on the longitudinal central axis of the wiper blade 10 and the pin diameter 74 is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 34, it is ensured that the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the spring rails 36, 38 are always located at a distance from the web 34. The wiper strip 2 0 is thus suspended to a certain extent in a freely "floating" manner between the spring rails 36, 38 and can be optimally adapted during the wiping operation to the particular requirements. This is also true for the spring rails of the embodiments of the invention described in the following.<br>
In another embodiment of the wiper blade according to the invention, illustrated in; Figures 6 to 8, the statements which have already been made with<br><br>
regard to the above-described embodiment apply - with the exception of the hole 72 and the pin 70. Therefore, the reference numbers which have already been used therein are also used in Figures 6 to 8 for identical refinements. In a departure from this, however, the end cap 148 according to Figures 6 to 8 is.produced from a flexible plastic. A tongue 152 is exposed in the base plate 150 of the end cap 148, which tongue is connected integrally to an end wall 154 of the end cap 148, which end wall faces the longitudinal end edges of the spring rails 36, 38. A pin 170, which extends between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the spring rails 36, 38, is arranged at the free end of the tongue 152. The tongue 152 can be deflected in the direction of the arrow 172 (Figure 8) counter to a restoring force, which is building up and acts counter to the arrow 172, from its operational position illustrated in Figure 8 into an installation position. In this position, the pin 170 completely releases the two spring rails 36, 38, so that the end cap 148 can be pulled off without difficulty since the two spring rails can now be moved towards each other to such an extent that the shoulders 66 are no longer able to interact with the mating shoulders 68. Conversely, the installation of the end cap 148 on the spring rails 36, 3 8 is, of course, also possible without any problem since this takes place with the pin 170 correspondingly deflected, the said pin, only after the correct installation position of the end cap 148 has been reached, passing, following the restoring force, between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 4 0 and 42 of the spring rails 36, 38 and therefore also causing the interaction of the shoulders 66 and 68. By means of a corresponding arrangement of the pin 170 with respect to the longitudinal central axis of the wiper blade and by means of corresponding matching of the width 174 of the pin 170 the effect; is achieved that  the pin 170,  which is  inserted between the<br><br>
mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the spring rails 36, 38 when the end cap 148 is fitted, holds the said spring rails at a distance 44 from each other, which distance is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 34 (figure 3).<br>
In the explanation of an embodiment of the wiper blade according to the invention, which embodiment is to be explained below with reference to Figures 9 to 11, as regards the reference numbers, the statement which has already been made in this respect for the embodiment according to Figures 6 to 8 applies. In this embodiment too, the end cap 248 is manufactured from a spring-elastic material, preferably plastic. Instead of the spring tongue 152 which is exposed and is provided with the pin 170 in the embodiment according to Figures 6 to 8, two finger-like lugs 256, which can be deflected counter to spring force, are arranged on the end wall 254 (Figure 9) , which lugs extend essentially in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade and, when the end cap 256 is fitted on the spring rails 36, 38, are placed under tension against the two mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42. In the process, they press the two spring rails apart to a sufficient extent that the distance 44 between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the two spring rails 36, 38 is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 34. These lugs 256 are matched and arranged in such a manner that in this case, too, the abovementioned, correct operating position of the spring rails 36, 38 is ensured permanently. Here too, the shoulders 6 6 of the projections 62 grip behind the mating shoulders 68 which are formed on the end cap 248. The particular advantage of this embodiment can be seen in the fact that the installation of the end caps is achieved by a single, rectilinear plug-on movement which can be carried out without any problem by automatic installation machines and which !ends when the shoulders 66 interact with their mating shoulders 68.<br><br>
The correct position of the spring rails 36, 38 in their longitudinal grooves 28, 30 of the wiper strip 20 is then also achieved.<br>
Finally, a further embodiment of the wiper blade according to the invention is explained below with reference to Figures 12 and 13. In the section shown in Figure 12 through the wiper blade 10 the cross section of the connecting device 16, which is arranged in the central section of the wiper blade, can also be seen. Apart from the specially designed means used to provide the required articulated connection between the wiper arm and wiper blade, the cro&amp;s section through the connecting device is similar to the cross sections according to Figures 5, 7 and 10 through the end caps 48 and 148 and 248, respectively. The connecting device 16 therefore likewise has a base plate 350 which is provided with claw-like lugs 352 which grip longitudinal side regions of the spring rails 36, 38 from below, which regions protrude out of the longitudinal grooves 28 and 30 of the wiper strip 20. The connecting device 16 can therefore with [sic] be slid like a slide onto these spring rail regions. As Figure 12 also shows, the spring rails 36, 38 lie in their longitudinal grooves 28, 3 0 of the wiper strip 20 in such a manner that the distance 44 between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the spring rails 36, 38 is greater than the width 46 of the web 34 remaining between the longitudinal grooves 28, 30. This correct position of the spring rails 36, 38 with regard to the web 34 is ensured permanently by the fact that corresponding securing means are arranged on the connecting device 16. In the exemplary embodiment, these means are formed, for example, by countersunk lead screws 354 and by headless pins 3 56 which penetrate the spring rails 36, 38, in recesses 358 provided therein, transversely to the longitudinal extent of the said spring rails. These screws 354 and pins 356 are expediently fastened in the connecting<br><br>
device 16, which is preferably manufactured from plastic. As a departure from the screws and pins which are illustrated in the exemplary embodiment, it is conceivable to replace them either by cylindrical pins, grooved pins or the like. As Figure 13 shows, two screws or pins are provided for each spring rail.<br>
Since the plan view which can be seen in Figure 13 applies to all of the embodiments of the wiper blade according to the invention which are described here, it is obvious that both the end caps 48 or 148 or 248 and the connecting device 16 are arranged on mutually opposite sections of the spring rails, which sections protrude out of the longitudinal grooves assigned to the said spring rails. This can also be achieved with spring rails situated completely in their longitudinal grooves by the latter being provided with, as seen in the longitudinal extent of the wiper blade 10, short sections which lie opposite one another in pairs and which protrude out of the longitudinal grooves and form the engagement regions for the bridge-like components. The end caps 48 or 148 or 248 and the connecting device 16 therefore form bridge-like components which fit with their base plates 50 or 350 over the spring rails and bear against the mutually remote longitudinal edges of the spring rails. It is furthermore clearly apparent that on each of these abovementioned, bridge-like components at least one securing means - pin 70 or pin 170 or lugs 256 or screws 354, 356 - are arranged, the said securing means ensuring the correct distance 44, which is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 40. In the embodiments according to Figures 4 to 11, the means for securing the correct distance 44 are inserted between the mutually facing longitudinal edges 40, 42 of the spring rails 36, 38 in such a manner that they bear against the longitudinal edges. In the embodiment according to Figures 12 and 13, the distance-securing means 354 and 356 are arranged on the<br><br>
connecting device 16 and grip into recesses 358 of the respective spring rail 36, 38.<br>
Figure 14 shows the principle of the refinements according to Figures 4 to 11, in which the pins 70 or 170 and the spring lugs 256 are illustrated non-objectively by spacers 100.<br>
A common feature of all of the exemplary embodiments is that the distance "44 between the mutually facing, inner longitudinal edges 4 0 of the two spring rails 36, 38 is greater than the width 46 of the intermediate web 34.<br>
It is clear that the design according to Figures 12 and 13 can be combined without any problem with one of the designs according to Figures 4 and 5 or 6 to 8 or 9 to 11. Moreover, it is conceivable to arrange between the end caps according to Figures 2 to<br>
11	- independently of the design according to Figures<br>
12	and 13 - further, bridge-like structural elements which can likewise be provided with distance-securing means. This is recommended in particular in the case of very long wiper blades.<br><br><br>
3.	Wiper blade according to Claim 2 characterized in that the two spring rails (36, 38) protrude at their two end sections out of their grooves (28, 30) both in the longitudinal direction and transversely to the longitudinal direction of the wiper strip (20), in that a respective end cap (48 or 148 or 248) , which serves as the bridge-like component, is arranged on these end sections, and in that distance-securing means (70 or 170 or 254), which interact with the mutually facing longitudinal edges (4 0, 42) of the spring rails (36, 38), are arranged on the end cap.<br>
