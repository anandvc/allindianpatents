Field of Invention<br>
This invention is related to the field of processes for producing a polymer<br>
composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The production of polymers is a multi-billion dollar business. This business<br>
produces billions of pounds of polymers each year. Millions of dollars have been spent<br>
on developing technologies that can add value to this business.<br>
Increasing production of polymers from polymerization processes is an important<br>
area of polymer research. In addition, discovering new polymer blends having superior<br>
properties also is a continuing research goal. Specifically, improving optical properties,<br>
such as haze and gloss, of such polymers blends blown into film, also is an important goal<br>
of polymer research since film is often used in packaging and other applications.<br>
It is desirable to provide a process for producing a polymer composition.<br>
Again it is desirable provide the polymer composition.<br>
Once again it is desirable to provide a process for increasing the production of<br>
polymers from polymerization processes by increasing the bulk density of a narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution base polymer by incorporating a high molecular weight<br>
polymer component with the narrow molecular weight distribution base polymer to<br>
produce a polymer composition.<br>
Yet again it is desirable to provide a process for increasing the clarity of blown<br>
film produced from a narrow molecular weight distribution base polymer by incorporating<br>
a high molecular weight polymer component with the narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution base polymer to produce a polymer composition.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, a process for producing a<br>
polymer composition is provided. The process comprises incorporating a narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution base polymer and a high molecular weight polymer<br>
component to produce the polymer composition;<br>
wherein the base polymer is an ethylene polymer having a Mw/Mn less than about<br>
5 and a melt flow index from about 0.2 g/10 min to about 20 g/10 min; and<br>
wherein the high molecular weight polymer component has a molecular weight<br>
distribution such that at least a substantial portion of its molecules have a molecular<br>
weight of greater than one million, the component being incorporated is in an amount to<br>
give about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, based on the total weight of said polymer<br>
composition, of the molecules having a molecular weight greater than one million.<br>
These objects, and other objects, will become more apparent to those with<br>
ordinary skill in the art after reading this disclosure.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A process is provided for producing a polymer composition. The process<br>
comprises incorporating a narrow molecular weight distribution base polymer and a high<br>
molecular weight polymer component. The narrow molecular weight distribution base<br>
polymer is hereinafter referred to as a "base polymer". When the base polymer is<br>
incorporated with the high molecular weight polymer component, the bulk density of the<br>
base polymer is increased, thereby, increasing the production rate. The bulk density of the<br>
polymer composition can be increased by about 10% to about 40% over the bulk density<br>
of the base polymer. In order to achieve the bulk density increase, the high molecular<br>
weight polymer component must be incorporated with the base polymer while the base<br>
polymer is produced in a polymerization zone.<br>
Another benefit of incorporating the base polymer and the high molecular weight<br>
polymer component is to increase the clarity of blown film produced from the base<br>
polymer. In order to achieve this clarity increase, the incorporation of the high molecular<br>
weight polymer component can be accomplished either while the base polymer is being<br>
produced in the polymerization zone or after the base polymer and high molecular weight<br>
polymer component have been produced separately. For example, the base polymer and<br>
high molecular weight polymer component can be blended together to produce the<br>
polymer composition. The haze of the polymer composition can be decreased by about<br>
5% to as much as about 60% over the haze of the base polymer, and the gloss of the<br>
polymer composition can be increased by about 10 to about 40% over the gloss of the<br>
base polymer.<br>
The base polymer is defined as the narrow molecular weight polymer before the<br>
high molecular weight polymer component is added to produce the polymer composition.<br>
The base polymer can be any narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene polymer,<br>
either a homopolymer or copolymer, such as, for example, ethylene-hexene copolymers.<br>
The base polymer has a Mw(weight average molecular weight)/Mn (number average<br>
molecular weight) of less than about 5.0. Preferably, Mw/Mh of the base polymer is less<br>
than about 4.0, and most preferably, Mw/Mn of the base polymer is less than 3.0.<br>
Base polymers can be produced from any catalyst known in the art to produce<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution polymers. For example, metallocene catalysts of<br>
various types, such as described in U.S. Patents 5,436,305; 5,610,247; and 5,627,247,<br>
herein incorporated by reference, can be used to produce the base polymer. Ziegler<br>
catalysts containing magnesium and titanium halides, such as described in U.S. Patents<br>
5,275,992; 5,179,178; 5,275,992; 5,237,025; 5,244,990; and 5,179,178, herein<br>
incorporated by reference, can also be used. Chromium catalysts as described for<br>
example in U.S. Patents 3,887,494; 3,119,569; 3,900,457; 4,981,831; 4,364,842; and<br>
4,444,965, herein incorporated by reference, also can be utilized to produce the base<br>
polymer. Preferably, the base polymer is produced from metallocene catalyst. Since<br>
these catalysts are well known to produce a narrow molecular weight distribution<br>
polymer, are very active, and often are very efficient for the incorporation of comonomer.<br>
The base polymer can be an ethylene homopolymer or preferably, a copolymer of<br>
ethylene and at least one other alpha-olefin, such as 1-hexene, 1-butene, or 1-octene.<br>
Most preferably, the base polymer is an ethylene-hexene copolymer.<br>
Generally, the density of the base polymer is in a range of about 0.900 g/cc to<br>
about 0.975 g/cc. Preferably, the density of the base polymer is in a range of about 0.910<br>
g/cc to about 0.940 g/cc, and most preferably, from 0.915 g/cc to 0.93 g/cc. Generally,<br>
the base polymer has a melt flow index in a range from about 0.2 g/10 min to about 20<br>
g/10 min. Preferably, the base polymer has a melt flow index in a range from about 0.5<br>
g/10 min to about 10 g/10 min, and most preferably from 0.8 g/10 min to 5.0 g/10 min.<br>
The high molecular weight polymer component can be produced from most any<br>
known catalyst system, whether the high molecular weight polymer component is<br>
produced simultaneously with the base polymer in the polymerization zone, or separately<br>
and blended later. Suitable catalysts for production of the high molecular weight polymer<br>
component include, but are not limited to, Ziegler catalysts based on titanium halides,<br>
zirconium halides, zirconium alkyls, chromium oxide catalysts, metallocene catalysts, and<br>
mixtures thereof .<br>
The high molecular weight polymer component has a molecular weight<br>
distribution, such that, a substantial portion of its molecules have a molecular weight<br>
greater than one million. Generally, the high molecular weight polymer component being<br>
incorporated is in an amount to give about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the polymer composition, of the molecules having a molecular weight<br>
greater than one million. Preferably, the high molecular weight polymer component being<br>
incorporated is in an amount to give about 0.5% to about 5% by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the polymer composition, of the molecules having a molecular weight greater<br>
than one million, most preferably, 1% to 3% by weight.<br>
It is not imperative that the additional high molecular weight polymer component<br>
be pure. For example, a high molecular weight polymer component which also contains a<br>
substantial amount of polymer of molecular weight lower than one million can be incor-<br>
porated into the base polymer provided it has a sufficient amount of polymer above one<br>
million in molecular weight to contribute the proper amount of high molecular weight<br>
polymer component described previously.<br>
To achieve the increase in bulk density of the polymer composition, the high<br>
molecular weight polymer component must be incorporated with the base polymer in the<br>
polymerization zone. Any method known in the art to incorporate the high molecular<br>
weight polymer component with the base polymer in the polymerization zone can be<br>
utilized.<br>
One method of incorporating the high molecular weight polymer component is to<br>
modify a polymerization catalyst system before it is added to the polymerization zone.<br>
For example, a second transition metal component can be added to the polymerization<br>
catalyst system which then is capable of generating simultaneously the base polymer and<br>
the high molecular weight polymer component.<br>
A second method of incorporating the high molecular weight polymer component<br>
is to chemically modify the polymerization catalyst system while it is in the poly-<br>
merization zone, such as by adding a second component which will react with a catalyst<br>
in the polymerization catalyst system to create the high molecular weight polymer<br>
component For example, a metallocene catalyst system can be modified to include a<br>
titanium or chromium component, either before the metallocene catalyst system is<br>
introduced into the polymerization zone, or while it is in the polymerization zone. A<br>
halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound or fluorided, chromium-containing<br>
solid oxide compound can be utilized as the titanium or chromium component.<br>
The halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound comprises at least one<br>
halogen, titanium, and a solid oxide compound. The halogen is at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of chlorine, bromine, and fluorine. Generally, the solid oxide<br>
compound is selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, aluminophosphate,<br>
aluminosilicates, aluminoborates, silica-zirconia, silica-titania, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the solid oxide compound is silica-alumina or alumina. The solid oxide<br>
compound can be produced by any method known in the art, such as, for example, by<br>
gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and flame hydrolysis.<br>
When silica-titania is used, the content of titania can be about 1 to about 15% by<br>
weight titanium based on the total weight of the silica-titania, preferably, about 2.5 to<br>
about 12% by weight, and most preferably, 4 to 10% by weight, with the remainder being<br>
primarily silica. The silica-titania can be produced by any method known in the art.<br>
Such processes are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,887,494; 3,119,569; 4,405,501; 4,436,882;<br>
4,436,883; 4,392,990; 4,081,407; 4,152,503; 4,981,831; 2,825,721; 3,225,023; 3,226,205;<br>
3,622,521; and 3,625,864; the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. The silica-titania can be made by cogellation of aqueous materials, or by<br>
cogellation in an organic or anhydrous solution, or by coating the surface of silica with a<br>
layer of titania such as, for example, by reaction of silanol groups with titanium<br>
isopropoxide followed by calcining.<br>
Aluminophosphate can be made by any method known in the art, such as, for<br>
example, those methods disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,364,842; 4,444,965; 4,364,855;<br>
4,504,638; 4,364,854; 4,444,964; 4,444,962; 4,444,966; and 4,397,765; the entire<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Silica-alumina can be made by any method known in the art. The amount of<br>
alumina in the silica-alumina can range from about 2 to about 50% by weight based on<br>
the total weight of the silica-alumina, preferably, from about 5 to about 30% by weight,<br>
and most preferably, 8 to 20% by weight. Commercial grade silica-alumina is available<br>
as MS 13-110 from W. R. Grace and commercial grade alumina as Ketjen Grade B or<br>
Ketjen Grade L from Akzo Nobel.<br>
Generally, the specific surface area of the solid oxide compound is from about 100<br>
to about 1000 m2/g, preferably, from about 200 to about 800 m2/g, and most preferably,<br>
from 250 to 600 m2/g after calcining at 500°C.<br>
The specific pore volume of the solid oxide compound is typically greater than<br>
about 0.5 cm3/Vg, preferably, greater than about 0.8 cm3/Vg, and most preferably, greater<br>
than 1.0 cm3/Vg.<br>
The halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound can be produced when the<br>
solid oxide compound is contacted with at least one titanium-containing compound and at<br>
least one halogen-containing compound. The order of contacting the solid oxide<br>
compound with the titanium-containing compound and the halogen-containing compound<br>
can vary.<br>
To produce the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound, at least one<br>
titanium-containing compound is contacted with the solid oxide compound by any means<br>
known in the art to produce a titanium-containing solid oxide compound. Titanium can<br>
be added to the solid oxide compound before, during, or after calcining. Generally, the<br>
amount of titanium present in the titanium-containing solid oxide compound is in a range<br>
of about 0.01 to about 10 weight percent titanium where the weight percent is based on<br>
the weight of the titanium-containing solid oxide compound. Preferably, the amount of<br>
titanium present in the titanium-containing solid oxide compound is in a range of about<br>
0.1 to about 5 weight percent titanium based on the weight of the titanium-containing<br>
solid oxide compound. Most preferably, the amount of titanium present in the titanium-<br>
containing solid oxide compound is in a range of 0.5 to 2 weight percent titanium based<br>
on the weight of the titanium-containing solid oxide compound.<br>
In one method of producing a titanium-containing solid oxide compound, the solid<br>
oxide compound can be contacted with an aqueous or organic solution of the titanium-<br>
containing compound before calcining. For example, the titanium can be added to the<br>
solid oxide compound by forming a slurry of the solid oxide compound in a solution of<br>
the titanium-containing compound and a suitable solvent such as alcohol or water.<br>
Particularly suitable are one to three carbon atom alcohols because of their volatility and<br>
low surface tension. Titanium alkoxides, Ti(OR)4, where R is an alkyl or aryl group<br>
having 1 to about 12 carbons, is particularly suitable as a titanium source. A suitable<br>
amount of the solution is utilized to provide the desired concentration of titanium after<br>
drying. Drying can be effected by any method known in the art For example, said drying<br>
can be completed by suction filtration followed by evaporation, vacuum drying, spray<br>
drying, or flash drying. This method is exemplified by U.S. Patents 4,294,724;<br>
4,382,022; 4,402,864; 4,405,768; and 4,424,320; the entire disclosures of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In a second method, the titanium can be cogelled into the solid oxide compound<br>
when the solid oxide compound is being produced as exemplified by U.S. Patents<br>
3,887,494; 3,119,569; 4,405,501, and 4,436,882, the entire disclosures of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
If the titanium is added before calcination, any water soluble or organic soluble<br>
titanium-containing compound is suitable that can impregnate the solid oxide compound<br>
with titanium. In a coprecipitation method, a titanium compound such as titanium<br>
halides, titanium nitrates, titanium sulfates, titanium oxalate, or alkyl titanates, for<br>
example, is incorporated with an acid or a silicate. Titanyl sulfate (TiOSO4) dissolved in<br>
sulfuric acid is a particularly suitable compound. If the titanium is deposited onto the<br>
surface of an already formed solid oxide compound, titanium halides, TiX4 where X is<br>
chloride or bromide, or alkyl titanates, Ti(OR)4 where R is an alkyl or aryl group<br>
containing 1 to about 12 carbons are preferred.<br>
If the titanium is added during calcining, one convenient method is to vaporize a<br>
volatile titaniurn-containing compound, such as titanium tetrachloride or titanium tetra-<br>
fluoride, or an alkyl titanate (Ti(OR)4 where R is an alkyl or aryl group containing 1 to<br>
about 12 carbons, into a gas stream used to contact the solid oxide compound.<br>
If the titanium is added after calcining, a preferred method is to impregnate the<br>
solid oxide compound with a hydrocarbon solution of the titanium-containing compound,<br>
preferably a titanium halide or titanium alkoxyhalide, such as TiCl4, TiORCl3,<br>
Ti(OR)2Cl2, and the like, where R is an alkyl or aryl group having 1 to about 12 carbons.<br>
Calcining is conducted at various steps in the production of the halided, titanium-<br>
containing solid oxide compound. Generally, calcining is conducted for about 1 minute<br>
to about 100 hours, preferably from about 1 hour to about 50 hours, and most preferably,<br>
from 3 to 20 hours. Generally, the calcining is conducted at a temperature in a range of<br>
about 200°C to about 900°C, preferably from about 300°C to about 700°C, and most<br>
preferably, from 350°C to 600°C. The calcining can be conducted in any suitable<br>
atmosphere. Generally, the calcining can be completed in an inert atmosphere.<br>
Alternatively, the calcining can be completed in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as, oxygen<br>
or air, or a reducing atmosphere, such as, hydrogen or carbon monoxide.<br>
To produce the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound, the solid<br>
oxide compound is also contacted with at least one halogen-containing compound. The<br>
halogen-containing compound is at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
chlorine-containing compounds, bromine-containing compounds, and fluorine-containing<br>
compounds. The halogen-containing compound can be in a liquid phase, or preferably, a<br>
vapor phase. Optionally, the solid oxide compound can be calcined at about 100°C to<br>
about 900°C before being contacted with the halogen-containing compound.<br>
Any method of fluoriding the solid oxide compound known in the art can be used<br>
in this invention. A common method is to impregnate the solid oxide compound with an<br>
aqueous solution of a fluoride-containing salt before calcining, such as ammonium<br>
fluoride [NH4F], ammonium bifluoride [NH4HF2], hydrofluoric acid [HF], ammonium<br>
silicofluoride [(NH4)2SiF6], ammonium fluoroborate [NH4BF4], ammonium<br>
fluorophosphate [NH4PF6], and mixtures thereof.<br>
In a second method, the fluorine-containing compound can be dissolved into an<br>
organic compound, such as an alcohol, and added to the solid oxide compound before<br>
calcining to minimize shrinkage of pores during drying. Drying can be accomplished by<br>
an method known in the art, such as, for example, vacuum drying, spray drying, flashing<br>
drying, and the like.<br>
In a third method, the fluorine-containing compound can be incorporated into the<br>
gel formed when producing a solid oxide compound by adding it to at least one of the<br>
solutions before gellation. Alternatively, the fluorine-containing compound can be added<br>
to the gel before drying. Gellation methods to produce a solid oxide compound were<br>
discussed previously in this disclosure.<br>
In a fourth method, the fluorine-containing compound can be added during<br>
calcining. In this technique, the fluorme-containing compound is vaporized into the gas<br>
stream used to fluidize the solid oxide compound so that it is fluorided from the gas<br>
phase. In addition to some of the fluorine-containing compounds described previously,<br>
volatile organic fluorides can be used at temperatures above their decomposition points,<br>
or at temperatures high enough to cause reaction. For example, perfluorohexane,<br>
perfluorobenzene, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic anhydride, hexafluoroacetyl-<br>
acetonate, and mixtures thereof can be vaporized and contacted with the solid oxide<br>
compound at about 300°C to about 600°C in air or nitrogen. Inorganic fluorine-<br>
containing compounds can also be used, such as hydrogen fluoride or even elemental<br>
fluorine.<br>
The amount of fluorine present on the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide<br>
compound is about 2 to about 50 weight percent fluorine based on the weight of the<br>
halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound before calcining or the amount added<br>
to a precalcined solid oxide compound. Preferably, it is about 3 to about 25 weight<br>
percent, and most preferably, it is 4 to 20 weight percent fluorine based on the weight of<br>
the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound before calcining or the amount<br>
added to a precalcined solid oxide compound.<br>
Any method of contacting the solid oxide compound with the chlorine-containing<br>
compound or the bromme-containing compound known in the art can be used in this<br>
invention. Generally, the contacting is conducted during or after calcining, preferably<br>
during calcining. Any suitable chlorine-containing compound or bromine-containing<br>
compound that can deposit chlorine or bromine or both on the solid oxide compound can<br>
be used. Suitable chlorine-containing compounds and bromine-containing compound<br>
include volatile or liquid organic chloride or bromide compounds and inorganic chloride<br>
or bromide compounds. Organic chloride or bromide compounds can be selected from<br>
the group consisting of carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloroethane, hexachloro-<br>
benzene, trichloroacetic acid, bromoform, dibromomethane, perbromopropane, phosgene,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Inorganic chloride or bromide compounds can be selected from the<br>
group consisting of gaseous hydrogen chloride, silicon tetrachloride, tin tetrachloride,<br>
titanium tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride, boron trichloride, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl<br>
chloride, hydrogen bromide, boron tribromide, silicon tetrabromide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Additionally, chlorine and bromine gas can be used. Optionally, a fluorine-containing<br>
compound can also be included when contacting the zirconium-containing solid oxide<br>
compound with the chlorine-containing compound or bromine-containing compound to<br>
achieve higher activity in some cases.<br>
If an inorganic chlorine-containing compound or bromine-containing compound is<br>
used, such as titanium tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride, or boron trichloride, it can also<br>
be possible to achieve the chloriding or bromiding after calcining, either by vapor phase<br>
deposition or even by using an anhydrous solvent<br>
The amount of chlorine or bromine used can be from about 0.01 to about 10 times<br>
the weight of the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound before calcining or<br>
the amount added to a precalcined solid oxide compound, preferably it is from about 0.05<br>
to about 5 times, most preferably from 0.05 to 1 times the weight of the halided, titanium-<br>
containing solid oxide compound before calcining or the amount added to a precalcined<br>
solid oxide compound.<br>
Generally, the solid oxide compound is contacted with the chlorine-containing<br>
compound or bromine-containing compound at a temperature in the range of about 25°C<br>
to about 1000°C, preferably from about 200°C to 700°C, and most preferably from 300°C<br>
to 600°C.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, an additional compound can be added to<br>
the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound to enhance the activity of the<br>
organometal compound. For example, an additional metal, such as, zinc, silver, copper,<br>
antimony, gallium, tin, nickel, tungsten, and mixtures thereof, can be added by contacting<br>
the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound with a metal-containing<br>
compound. This is especially useful if the solid oxide compound is to be chlorided during<br>
calcining. When used, these metals are added in an amount of about 0.01 to about 10<br>
millimoles per gram of halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound, preferably<br>
about 0.1 to about 5 millimoles per gram, and most preferably from 0.5 to 3 millimoles of<br>
metal per gram of halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound.<br>
Preferably, magnesium is added to the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide<br>
compound to increase the activity of the titanium component of the catalyst composition<br>
by contacting the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound with a magnesium-<br>
containing compound. The amount of magnesium used can be from about 0.01 to about<br>
10 millimoles per gram of halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound, preferably<br>
from about 0.1 to about 5 millimoles per gram, most preferably from 0.1 to 1 millimoles<br>
per gram of halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound. If magnesium is added,<br>
it can be added before or after calcining. One preferred method of adding magnesium is<br>
to contact an organomagnesium compound in a hydrocarbon solution with the halided,<br>
titanium-containing solid oxide compound. Examples of such compounds include, but<br>
are not limited to, dialkyl magnesium, alkyl magnesium halide, magnesium alkoxide or<br>
aryloxides, and the like.<br>
The fluorided, chromium-containing solid oxide compound comprises fluorine,<br>
chromium, and a solid oxide compound. The solid oxide compounds discussed<br>
previously can be utilized to produce the fluorided, chromium-contarning solid oxide<br>
compound. The fluorine can be added to the solid oxide compound as discussed<br>
previously for the halided, titanium-containing solid oxide compound. The chromium can<br>
be added to the solid oxide compound as discussed previously for titanium. Examples of<br>
chromium-containing compounds include, but are not limited to, chromium trioxide<br>
(CrO3), ammonium chromate ((NH4)2CrO4), ammonium dichromate ((NH4)2Cr2O7),<br>
chromic acetate (Cr2H3O3), chromic nitrate (Cr(NO3)3), chromous chloride (CrCl2), bis-<br>
benzene chromium(0) ((C6H6)2Cr), chromocene ((C5H5)2Cr), and mixtures thereof. The<br>
amount of chromium present is in the range of about 0.01 to about 10% by weight,<br>
preferably, about 0.5 to about 5% by weight, and most preferably, from 0.8% to 3% by<br>
weight, where the weight percents are based on the weight of the chromium-containing<br>
solid oxide compound before calcining.<br>
A third method to incorporate the high molecular weight polymer component is to<br>
produce a metallocene catalyst system comprising two metallocene components with a<br>
first metallocene component producing the base polymer and a second metallocene<br>
component producing the high molecular weight polymer component. Again, this can be<br>
accomplished before introduction into the polymerization zone or while in the poly-<br>
merization zone.<br>
To achieve improvements in the clarity of blown films made from the base<br>
polymer, the high molecular weight polymer component can be incorporated as described<br>
previously through catalyst system modification, or it can also be incorporated after<br>
production in the polymerization zone, such as, by melt blending the base polymer and<br>
the high molecular weight polymer component together. Preferably, the clarity<br>
improvement is obtained through catalyst modification since no blending is required.<br>
Polymerization can be carried out in any manner known in the art, such as, for<br>
example, gas phase, solution or slurry conditions, to effect polymerization. Any<br>
polymerization zone known in the art to produce ethylene polymers can be utilized. For<br>
example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried<br>
out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor. Processes that can<br>
polymerize monomers into polymers using the catalyst systems of this invention are<br>
known in the art, such as, for example, slurry polymerization, gas phase polymerization,<br>
solution polymerization, and multi-reactor combinations thereof.<br>
A preferred polymerization technique is that which is referred to as a particle<br>
form, or slurry process, wherein the temperature is kept below the temperature at which<br>
the polymer swells or goes into solution. A loop reactor is particularly preferred. Such<br>
polymerization techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed, for instance, in<br>
Norwood, U.S. 3,248,179, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Furthermore, it is even more preferred to use isobutane as a diluent in a slurry poly-<br>
merization. Examples of such technology can be found in U.S. Patents 4,424,341;<br>
4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; the entire disclosures of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within a range of about<br>
185°F to about 230°F (about 85°C to about 110°C), although higher or lower<br>
temperatures can be used. Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process<br>
are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in Norwood and those utilizing a<br>
plurality of stirred reactors either in series, parallel or combinations thereof wherein the<br>
reaction conditions can be different in the different reactors.<br>
Monomers useful in this invention are unsaturated hydrocarbons having from 2 to<br>
about 20 carbon atoms. Currently, it is preferred when the monomer is selected from the<br>
group consisting of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 1-pentene, 3-<br>
methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene,<br>
1-nonene, 1-decene, and mixtures thereof. However, when a homopolymer is desired, it<br>
is most preferred to use ethylene, or propylene, as the monomer. Additionally, when a<br>
copolymer is desired, it is most preferred to use ethylene and hexene as the monomers.<br>
The polymer density can be controlled by varying the comonomer to monomer ratio in the<br>
polymerization zone.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymer composition can be controlled by various<br>
means known in the art, such as, for example, adjusting the temperature (higher<br>
temperature giving lower molecular weight), introducing or varying the amount of<br>
hydrogen to alter the molecular weight, and varying the catalyst components in the<br>
catalyst system.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Polymerization Procedures<br>
Ethylene copolymers were prepared in a continuous particle form process (also<br>
known as a slurry process) by contacting a catalyst system with ethylene and 1-hexene<br>
monomers. The catalyst system consisted of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium<br>
dichloride, a cocatalyst, and Catalyst A, B, or C, which are described subsequently in this<br>
disclosure. The medium and temperature were selected such that the copolymer was<br>
produced as solid particles and was recovered in that form. Ethylene that had been dried<br>
over activated alumina was used as the monomer. Isobutane that had been degassed by<br>
fractionation and dried over alumina was used as the diluent. Ethylene copolymers were<br>
prepared in a continuous particle form process (also known as a slurry process) by<br>
contacting a first catalyst with ethylene and 1-hexene monomers. The medium and<br>
temperature were selected such that the copolymer was produced as solid particles and<br>
was recovered in that form. Ethylene that had been dried over activated alumina was used<br>
as the monomer. Isobutane that had been degassed by fractionation and dried over<br>
alumina was used as the diluent.<br>
A liquid full 15.2 cm diameter pipe loop having a volume of 23 gallons (87 liters)<br>
was utilized as a reactor. Liquid isobutane was used as the diluent, and occasionally some<br>
hydrogen was added to regulate the molecular weight of the ethylene copolymer. The<br>
reactor pressure was about 4 Mpa (about 580 psi). The reactor temperature was 80°C.<br>
The reactor was operated to have a residence time of 1.25 hours. Catalyst was added<br>
through a 0.35 cc circulating ball-check feeder. At steady state conditions, the isobutane<br>
feed rate was about 46 liters per hour, the ethylene feed rate was about 30 lbs/hr, and the<br>
1-hexene feed rate was varied to control the density of the ethylene copolymer. Ethylene<br>
concentration in the diluent was 8-12 mole percent Catalyst concentrations in the reactor<br>
ranged from 0.001 to about 1 weight percent based on the weight of the reactor contents.<br>
Ethylene copolymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of about 25 lbs per hour and<br>
recovered in a flash chamber. A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the ethylene copolymer<br>
under nitrogen at about 60-80°C.<br>
A cocatalyst, triethylaluminum (TEA), also was added as indicated in a<br>
concentration of about 10 to 100 parts per million by weight based on the weight of the<br>
diluent. To prevent static buildup in the reactor, a small amount (
commercial antistatic agent sold as Stadis® 450 usually was added. Bis(n-<br>
butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride was added to the reactor as a solution in<br>
isobutane to yield a reactor concentration of 0.5 to 1.5 parts per million based on the<br>
weight of the diluent. The metallocene, TEA cocatalyst, and Catalyst A, B, or C were<br>
added into a precontacting vessel where they were allowed to contact each other for about<br>
10 minutes before being introduced into the reactor and contacted with the monomers.<br>
Polymerization runs also were made in a 2.2 liter steel autoclave reactor equipped<br>
with a marine stirrer running at 400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The reactor was<br>
surrounded by a steel jacket containing boiling methanol with a connection to a steel<br>
condenser. The boiling point of the methanol was controlled by varying nitrogen pressure<br>
applied to the condenser and jacket, which permitted precise temperature control to within<br>
half a degree Celsius, with the help of electronic control instruments.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, first, a small amount (0.01 to 0.10 grams normally) of<br>
Catalyst A, B, or C was charged under nitrogen to the dry reactor. Next, 2.0 milliliters of<br>
a toluene solution containing 0.5 percent by weight of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)<br>
zirconium dichloride were added, followed by 0.6 liter of isobutane liquid. Then, 1.0<br>
milliliter of a 1.0 molar solution of triethylaluminum in heptane (TEA) was added,<br>
followed by another 0.6 liter of isobutane liquid. Then, the reactor was heated up to the<br>
specified temperature, generally 90°C, and finally ethylene was added to the reactor to<br>
equal a fixed pressure, typically 550 psig to produce a reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for usually about one hour. As ethylene<br>
was consumed, more ethylene flowed in to maintain the pressure. The activity was noted<br>
by recording the flow of ethylene into the reactor to maintain the set pressure.<br>
After the allotted time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor slowly<br>
depressurized and opened to recover a granular polymer powder. In all cases, the reactor<br>
was clean with no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling. The<br>
polymer powder was then removed and weighed. Activity was specified as grams of<br>
polymer produced per gram of Catalyst A, B, or C charged per hour.<br>
Feedstocks and Diluent<br>
The ethylene utilized was polymerization grade ethylene obtained from Union<br>
Carbide Corporation. The ethylene then was purified further through a column of ¼ inch<br>
beads of Alcoa A201 alumina mat had been activated at 250°C in nitrogen. The isobutane<br>
utilized was polymerization grade obtained from Phillips Petroleum Co., Borger, Texas.<br>
It was purified further by distillation, and it then was passed through a column of ¼ inch<br>
beads of Alcoa A201 alumina that had been activated at 250°C in nitrogen. The 1-hexene<br>
was polymerization grade obtained from Chevron. Chemicals. It was purified further by<br>
nitrogen purging and storage over 13X molecular sieve that had been activated at 250°C.<br>
Catalyst Preparation<br>
Catalyst A<br>
A silica-alumina was obtained from W.R. Grace as MS 13-110 containing 13% by<br>
weight alumina and 87% by weight silica. The silica-alumina had a pore volume of about<br>
1.2 cc/g and a surface area of about 450 square meters per gram. 800 grams of the silica-<br>
alumina were impregnated with 1500 milliliters of an aqueous solution containing 80<br>
grams of ammonium bifluoride to produce a mixture. The mixture then was dried in a<br>
vacuum oven overnight at 110°C, pushed through a 35 mesh screen, and activated by<br>
calcination in dry air at 450°C for six hours to produce a fluorided silica-alumina.<br>
Catalyst B<br>
470.83 grams of the same silica-alumina used for Catalyst A were calcined in air<br>
at 300°C for twelve hours to produce a calcined silica-alumina. Afterward, the calcined<br>
silica-alumina was impregnated just beyond the point of incipient wetness with a solution<br>
containing 169 grams of titanium ethoxide (or about 6% by weight Ti) in 500 mls of<br>
heptane to produce a first mixture. The first mixture was shaken thoroughly to ensure<br>
uniform wetness then dried in a vacuum oven at 140°C with a slight nitrogen purge<br>
overnight. Then, a solution of 47 grams of ammonium bifluoride in 500 mls of water was<br>
added to the first mixture to produce a second mixture. The second mixture was dried<br>
under vacuum at 140°C overnight to produce a dried second mixture. The dried second<br>
mixture contained about 6% by weight titanium and 10% by weight ammonium<br>
bifluoride. The dried second mixture then was calcined in dry air for 6 hours at 450°C to<br>
produce a fluorided, titanium-containing silica-alumina.<br>
Catalyst C<br>
750 grams of silica-alumina described previously were impregnated with 1500 mL<br>
of an aqueous solution containing 38 grams of ammonium bifluoride and 30 grams of<br>
chromium trioxide to equal 2% by weight chromium on the silica-alumina to produce a<br>
mixture. After being dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 110°C, the mixture was<br>
activated by calcination in dry air at 600°C for five hours in a fluidized bed to produce a<br>
fluorided, chromium-containing silica-alumina.<br>
Film Blowing<br>
Films were made from the polymer compositions of this invention and other<br>
polymers for comparison purposes using one of two blown film processing lines or a cast<br>
film line. One blown film processing line used a 1.5 inch diameter Davis-Standard<br>
extruder with a L/D of 24:1, having a barrel temperature of 190°C to 200°C, a screw speed<br>
of 115 RPM, and an output of 60 pounds per hour. The David-Standard extruder fed a 4<br>
inch diameter Sano die having a 0.060 inch die gap. Films of typically 0.001-0.0005 inch"<br>
(1 to 0.5 mil) thickness were blown on a 2.5:1 blow-up ratio and a production rate of 805<br>
ft/min. Frostline heights were usually in the range of 6-12 inches. Cooling was<br>
accomplished using a Dual Lip Air Ring using laboratory (ambient) air at about 75-80°F.<br>
After cooling, the film passed through a wooden take-up tower and nip roll assembly,<br>
with a resultant flattened or layflat width of 15.7 inches. These particular processing<br>
conditions were chosen since the film properties so obtained are representative of those<br>
obtained from larger, commercial scale film blowing conditions.<br>
The second blown processing line used an Egan extruder with a 3.5 inch diameter<br>
24:1 L/D Egan smooth barrel without grooves having a 2-stage screw with Dulmage<br>
mixing section. The Egan extruder fed a Sano 8-inch diameter die with 60 mil die gap.<br>
Thus, a 50 inch bubble was blown with a 2:1 blow-up ratio and 24 inch frostline height.<br>
Bubble layflat was 50 inches. Typical melt temperatures ranged from 210°C to 250°C.<br>
The cast films were made on a Randcastle Microtruder CF [Model RC-0625]<br>
which consisted of a table-top 5/8 inch (16 mm) single screw extruder. The extruder was<br>
fitted with a 5 inch (127 mm) wide slot die with a die gap of 0.020 inches (0.5 mm). The<br>
extruder and die temperatures were maintained at 204°C (400°F) and 215°C (420°F),<br>
respectively, resulting in a melt temperature of 196°C (385°F). The screw speed was<br>
adjusted to maintain a constant output rate of about 520 g/hr. The melt as it exited the die<br>
was quenched using a pair of high velocity air-knives, held 1 inch (25 mm) above and<br>
below the melt and at a distance of 4 inches (100 mm) downstream of the die exit. The<br>
film, subsequent to crystallization and solidification, was taken up through a pair of<br>
primary and secondary rollers onto a film winder. The take-up speed was adjusted to<br>
maintain a nominal film thickness of 3 mils (75 microns) for all samples.<br>
Polymer Tests<br>
Bulk density was determined in lbs/ft by weighing a 100 ml graduated cylinder in<br>
which polymer fluff had been lightly tapped.<br>
Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) on a<br>
compression molded sample, cooled at about 15°C per hour, and conditioned for about 40<br>
hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505-68 and ASTM D1928,<br>
procedure C.<br>
Melt Flow Index (MI) in grams of polymer per ten minutes was determined in<br>
accordance with ASTM D1238, condition 190/2, at 190°C with a 2,160 gram weight.<br>
High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with<br>
ASTM D1238, Condition 190/2.16, at 190°C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>
Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a<br>
Waters 150 CV gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the<br>
solvent, with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute at a temperature of 140°C. BHT (2,6-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-methylphenol) at a concentration of 1.0 g/L was used as a stabilizer in the TCB.<br>
An injection volume of 220 microliters was used with a nominal polymer concentration of<br>
0.3 g/1 (at room temperature). Dissolution of the sample in stabilized TCB was carried<br>
out by heating at 160-170°C for 20 hours with occasional, gentle agitation. The column<br>
was two Waters HT-6E columns (7.8 x 300mm). The columns were calibrated with a<br>
broad linear polyethylene standard (Phillips Marlex® polyethylene BHB 5003) for which<br>
the molecular weight had been determined.<br>
Haze was determined in accordance with ASTMD-1003. A Gardner XL211<br>
hazeguard/hazemeter system was utilized.<br>
Gloss was determined in accordance with ASTMD-2457.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The fiuorided, titanium-containing silica-alumina (Catalyst B) was tested for<br>
polymerization activity in the 2.2 liter autoclave reactor with 1 mL of TEA, but no metal-<br>
locene. It produced 53 grams of polymer per gram of fiuorided, titanium-containing<br>
silica-alumina per hour. The polymer had a zero melt index, a zero HLMI, and a viscosity<br>
average molecular weight of 2.4 million. Therefore, the fiuorided, titanium-containing<br>
silica-alumina produced a high molecular weight polymer component that can be utilized<br>
to produce the polymer composition of this invention.<br>
The fluorided, titanium-containing silica-alumina then was retested for poly-<br>
merization activity as conducted previously, except that a metallocene was added to the<br>
reactor also to produce a polymer composition. A much improved activity of 4680 grams<br>
of polymer per gram of fluorided, titanium-containing silica-alumina per hour was<br>
observed. Thus, the polymer composition obtained was a combination of a very small<br>
amount (about 1.1%) of an extremely high molecular weight polymer component from the<br>
fluorided, titanium-containing silica-alumina and a majority of lower molecular weight<br>
polymer produced from the metallocene catalyst. The fluorided, titanium-containing<br>
silica-alumina thus contributed a high molecular weight polymer component equal to<br>
about 1% of the bimodal polymer composition. The polymer composition had a high<br>
load melt index of 3.67 and a melt index of 0.22. These results are shown in Table 1.<br>
* Activity - grams of polymer per gram of fluorided, titanium-containing silica-<br>
alumina per hour.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Both catalysts A and B then were used in the 23 gallon loop reactor with bis(n-<br>
butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride to produce linear low density polyethylene<br>
(LLDPE). Both catalyst A and B had similar activity. In this back-to-back progression, it<br>
is easy to see the effect of the high molecular weight polymer component produced by<br>
Catalyst B. These results are shown in Table 2. Notice that although the HLMI/MI ratio<br>
did not change noticeably, there is a substantial rise in the bulk density of the polymer<br>
from about 20 lbs/ft to about 25 lbs/ft. This increase in bulk density allows for an<br>
increase in polymer production.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Both catalyst A and catalyst C were used in the 23 gallon loop reactor described<br>
previously with bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride at 80°C with 1-hexene<br>
as comonomer to make grades of linear low density film polymer. These polymers are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
GPC analysis of the polymers using a viscometer detector showed that the<br>
polymer produced from Catalyst C contained high molecular weight polymer component.<br>
Careful inspection revealed that the polymer from catalyst C contained about 2.8% of its<br>
polymer above a molecular weight of one million, whereas the polymer produced from<br>
catalyst A contained almost none.<br>
The polymer from Catalyst A and the inventive polymer composition produced<br>
using Catalyst C were successfully blown into 1 mil thick film on the second processing<br>
line described previously. The film produced using the inventive polymer composition<br>
had improved melt strength. The melt index of film produced using catalyst A was 0.78<br>
g/10 min, 0.90 g/10 mm, and 0.94 g/10 min while the film produced using the inventive<br>
polymer composition produced from catalyst C had a melt index of 1.16 g/10 min and<br>
2.03 g/10 min.<br>
The optical properties of the film also are shown in Table 3. The high molecular<br>
polymer produced by Catalyst C contained in the polymer composition resulted in<br>
improved optical properties. The haze of the film using polymer produced from Catalyst<br>
A was 9.92%, 15.13%, and 12.7%, while the haze of the film using the inventive polymer<br>
composition from Catalyst C was 7.83% and 6.6%. The gloss of the film using the<br>
polymer composition produced from Catalyst C also was improved over the film<br>
produced from polymer produced from Catalyst A.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Another demonstration of improved properties from the polymer composition can<br>
be seem from the following blending study. A metallocene-based LLDPE, commercially<br>
available from Phillips Petroleum Company as grade D143, was blended with varying<br>
amounts of another low density polyethylene polymer, also sold commercially through<br>
Phillips Petroleum Company as D257. D143 was used as the base polymer and had a<br>
melt index of 1.3 g/10 min, density of 0.916 g/cc, polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 2.3, and by<br>
GPC determination, contained almost no polymer having a molecular weight above one<br>
million. D257 was utilized as the high molecular weight polymer component. D257 is a<br>
chromium-based, broad molecular weight distribution, low density polymer containing a<br>
high molecular weight polymer component. It had a melt index of 0.2 g/10 min and a<br>
density of 0.923 g/cc. By GPC analysis, it was estimated that D257 contained about<br>
10.3% by weight of polymer having a molecular weight greater than one million.<br>
These two polymers were blended together during film blowing on the second<br>
processing line described previously, then blown into 1 mil thick film. The smallest<br>
increment of D257 added was 20% of the polymer composition, which equates to about<br>
2.1% by weight of the polymer contained in the polymer composition having a molecular<br>
weight greater than one million. This amount provided a reduction in the already low haze<br>
value. The results of mis study are shown in Table 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Another blending study was conducted in which D257 was blended with another<br>
metallocene derived base polymer. This base polymer had a melt index of about 1 g/10<br>
min, a density of 0.926 g/cc, and a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 2.4. Only 3% of D257 was<br>
blended with 97% of the base polymer, so that the polymer composition contained about<br>
0.3 % of polymer having a molecular weight greater than one million. It was then<br>
converted into 1 mil film using the case film processing line described previously. Even<br>
this small quantity of added high molecular polymer component yielded a significant<br>
improvement in clarity. These data are summarized in Table 5.<br>
While this invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration, it<br>
is not intended to be limited thereby but is intended to cover all changes and<br>
modifications within the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Another blending study was conducted in which D257 was blended with yet<br>
another metallocene derived base polymer. This base polymer had a melt index of about<br>
1 g/10 min, a density of 0.920 g/cc, and a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 2.4. Only 5% of<br>
D257 was blended with 95% the base polymer, so that the polymer composition contained<br>
about 0.5% of polymer having a molecular weight greater than one million. It was then<br>
converted into 1 mil film using the first blow film processing line described previously.<br>
Even this small quantity of added high molecular weight polymer component yielded a<br>
significant improvement in optical properties as may be seen from the reduction in haze.<br>
These data are summarized in Table 6.<br>
While this invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration, it<br>
is not intended to be limited thereby but is intended to cover all changes and<br>
modifications within the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
