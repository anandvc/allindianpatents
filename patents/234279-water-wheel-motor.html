				<td>Water Wheel Motor.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The technical solution refers to the equipment for change of hydro-energetic potential of water flow to the mechanical energy with the possibility of further transformation of the energy into another form. Background of the invention<br>
At the presence there are many types of the equipments used in the world for transformation of hydro-energetic potential of water flow to the mechanical energy with the possibility to transform this energy into another form. According to their design and the way of energy transformation they are divided into water wheels and water turbines.<br>
The water wheels are actuated by upper, middle and lower drive. The water wheels with upper drive use the potential energy of water. They are of the bucket type, rotating between the upper and lower water level. Water from the upper level flows into the buckets and turns the wheel by the water gravity; water flows out on the lower level. The operating conditions of water wheels with upper drive are: The water level difference from 3 to 12 m, water flow rate from 0.3 to 1.0 m3.s_1<br>
The water wheels with middle and lower drive are of the paddle type, they rotation axis is above the lower level and the water wheel paddles take the energy from the water by wading in the lower flow, created by stream coming from the upper level. The water wheel with middle drive use partially the potential energy and partially the kinetic energy of water streaming between the water wheel paddles approximately at the level of water wheel rotation axis. They are represented by Sagebien, Zuppinger and Piccard wheels. The water wheels with lower drive use only the kinetic energy of water flowing between the water wheel paddles in the tangential direction at the lower part of the water wheel. The representant of this type is the Poncelet wheel.<br>
The water wheel paddles are plane, or slightly bent in the plane perpendicular to the water wheel rotation axis. The operating conditions of water wheels with middle and lower drive are: The difference between water levels from 0.5 to 4.0 m, flow rates from 0.5 to 4.0 m3.s-1 The efficiency of all water wheels moves from 60 to 70 %. The advantage of water wheels is their simple design and low price. Their disadvantage is their low efficiency and a small range of operating conditions. The low efficiency js caused by paddle shape and their resistance by wading in water. The small range of operation conditions results from the relation between the water wheel dimension and the difference of water levels.<br>
The water turbines are classified, according to the water energy type they use, to the<br><br>
isobaric and overpressure type and according to the turbine water flow direction to radial, axial, radial-axial, diagonal, tangential, with oblique flow and double flow. The isobaric turbines - Pelton and Banki turbine, take the water kinetic energy.<br>
The Pelton turbine is of tangential type. Water is supplied via pressure pipe with a nozzle on its end, where its pressure energy is transformed into the kinetic one and the stream of water is sprayed in tangential direction on the space shaped turbine paddles along the turbine rotor circumference. The turbine rotor rotates in the air above the lower water level. The rotation axis can be horizontal and vertical. The operation ranges are: The difference between water levels from 30 to 900 m, flow rates from 0.02 to 1.0 mf.s"1. The efficiency moves up to 91%.<br>
The Banki turbine with double radial flow through the paddle wheel has1 a horizontal rotation axis. The wheel paddles take the kinetic energy from water streaming out of regulation flap, located immediately above the turbine wheel. The operation conditions are: The difference between water levels from 1.5 to 50 m, flow rates from 0.02 to 1.5 m3.s"'. The efficiency moves up to 85%.<br>
The representatives of water overpressure turbines are: Kaplan turbine, Francisci turbine, and their different modifications, for example so called propeller or suction turbine.<br>
The Kaplan turbine is of axial type. The operation conditions are: The difference between water levels from 1.5 to 75 m, flow rates from 0.2 to 20 m3.s'. The efficiency moves from 88 to 95%.<br>
The Francis turbine is of radial-axial type. The operation ranges are: The difference between water levels from 10 to 400 m, flow rates from 0.05 to 15 m3.s'. The efficiency moves from 88 to 95%.<br>
The advantage of water turbines is a big range of operation conditions and higher efficiency. Their disadvantage is the complicated equipment and high price.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a water wheel motor comprising a water wheel (5) rotating around a rotation axis( 18), isobaric paddles (4)fixed to the wheel, outlet device with axis(2) and drain device, characterized in that the all points of the wheel (5) and of the isobaric paddles (4) are in the bigger distance or in zero distance above the plane of the water in the drain device, which is either identical to or lower than and at the same time parallel to the plane (19) limiting the upper level of the drain device (6) space containing water.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
In the proposed technical solution the advantages of water wheel, simple design and low price, are combined with the advantages of water turbine; the water wheel motor, for energetic use of hydro-energetic potential of the water flow, consists of the outlet device, drain device, wheel and isobaric paddles fixed to the wheel, which can rotate around the rotation axis.<br>
The wheel with fixed isobaric paddles rotates around its rotation axis and has such a position, in relation to the drain device, that all paddle points are in the zero or bigger distance above the plane, which is identical or lower and at the same time parallel to the plane limiting the drain device space containing water.<br>
The rotation axis of the wheel with isobaric paddles can be vertical, horizontal or oblique.<br>
The outlet device, thanks to its shape and position of its axis in relation to the isobaric paddle wheel, guides the water stream, created by the hydro-energetic water potential, to the isobaric paddles fixed to the wheel.<br>
The isobaric paddles take the kinetic energy from water streaming on them and exerting the force on them, and they change this energy to the mechanical energy of the wheel rotary movement. The isobaric paddles, due to their shape, size, position in relation to the water stream, direction, shape of their trajectory and relative speed of their movement against the water stream, determine the transformation efficiency of kinetic water energy to the mechanical energy.<br>
The wheel design enables the further transport of its rotation movement energy, gained by means of the isobaric paddles from the kinetic water energy, to other technical equipments.<br>
The water stream, guided by the outlet equipment on the isobaric wheel paddles, falls from the isobaric wheel paddles, after giving them its kinetic energy, on the water surface, which is identical or lower and at the same time parallel with the plane limiting the space of drain device containing water, which is located below the wheel.<br>
