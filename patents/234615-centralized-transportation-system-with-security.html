				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a transportation system for persons or goods involving<br>
a singie centralized office for such controlling the transportation services with enhanced<br>
security and efficiency.<br>
BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Transport services typically involve all means of land, sea and air transportation, such as<br>
automotive carriage, airplanes, ships and rail. Passenger transportation is sometimes<br>
referred to as carriage transport. Shipment of goods refers to transporting everything<br>
other than persons and is sometimes referred to as a consignment. The present<br>
invention has application to greatly improving efficiency in managing and providing any<br>
kind of transport or transportation-related services. The most common application for<br>
the invention is in the system for managing and providing the transportation for<br>
persons or goods. For simplicity, the terms "persons or goods" or "passengers or goods"<br>
are equivalent and intended to include the terms "persons and goods" and passengers<br>
and goods," respectively.<br>
Transport companies are broadly defined to include those persons providing<br>
transportation services for passengers or goods, that is carriage transport and/or<br>
consignments. Transport companies are also known as forwarding agencies, which may<br>
own or rent the vehicles, which broadly include trucks, buses, automobiles, ships, trains<br>
airplanes, etc., used for each mode of transportation. Transport companies typically<br>
offer transportation services at a fixed price or at a price determined by a fare schedule.<br>
Persons desiring transport services either as a passenger or to ship goods typically select<br>
from the routes, times, and prices offered by these companies.<br>
By utilizing a combined or centralized management system, the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention makes all modes of transportation more efficient. By centralizing<br>
safety, security and background information and employing that information for each<br>
sale of transportation services, the preferred embodiment promotes traffic safety and<br>
obedience to transport rules and regulations. Such centralized management enables<br>
monitoring the technical operation and equipment used to provide transportation<br>
services, and this will also improve safety. Monitoring, in turn, improves the delivery of<br>
the transportation service and its reliability for persons using the services.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention serves passengers by empowering<br>
them to efficiently select from a variety of transport services, which are often available in<br>
densely populated areas. It offers persons the capability to identify the fastest<br>
transportation services available to reach the destination for them or for their goods<br>
being shipped. It enables customer feedback to a responsive organization, that is, the<br>
single administrative office, for example to contribute to the transport safety by means<br>
of their observations and remarks. Passenger and transport company registration<br>
provides a high level of security both in the identity of the passenger and the transport<br>
company employees providing service. The preferred embodiment provides a higher<br>
level of service for persons not satisfied with the standard transport and its benefits. It<br>
enables effective choices from among a myriad of transportation services in densely<br>
populated areas to avoid wasted time in traffic jams. The greater efficiency offered by<br>
the invention translates to reduced customer expenses for transport.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention serves the transport industry by<br>
implementing superior management and assignment of equipment used to deliver<br>
transportation services. It maximizes the capacity for transport, which also reduces the<br>
impact on the environment due and creates opportunities for using the equipment for<br>
other services. It enables transporters to reduce costs of transport execution, for<br>
example through reduced administrative expenses, through better route management<br>
which lowers cost incurred for fuel and minimizes noise and air pollution. The preferred<br>
embodiment enhances transport system efficiency by providing an efficient means to<br>
offer customer discounts to attract business, through reliable receipt of customer<br>
payment, through a centralized system for implementing security of both its employees<br>
and its customers, through provision of improved equipment to print, issue and confirm<br>
transport tickets so as to minimize the potential for ticket misuse or improper<br>
manipulation.<br>
The present invention serves the transport companies, their customers and society by<br>
implementing a centralized registration and verifying the identity of the persons seeking<br>
and providing such services. Such registration and verification minimizes the potential<br>
for crime in providing and using transportation services. It enables greater control to<br>
prevent improper manipulation of vehicles and auxiliary equipment used in providing<br>
transportation services. Further, by centralizing data on a variety of modes of<br>
transportation, the present invention enables quickly solving problems that arise when<br>
one mode is affected by a disabling event, such as a workers' strike, and then enables<br>
immediate identification of available alternatives, improving the flow of commerce.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention will serve to improve the prior art by enabling<br>
optimized selection of transportation services. It provides the means to consider all of<br>
the important variables affecting prompt and reliable service by a transport company.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1: is a block diagram of interactions involved in the system of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is a system for organizing, administering and operating a transportation<br>
system to enhance security and efficiency. The preferred embodiments centralize the<br>
administrative functions of securing transportation services with emphasis on handling<br>
the fare transport charges and the verifying the credentials and bona fides of the<br>
shippers, passengers and transporters' employees, collectively referred to as the<br>
participants in a transportation system.<br>
The system of the preferred embodiment employs a single administrative office to<br>
manage the operation of a transportation system for persons or goods. The<br>
transportation system typically has a variety of transporters for land, sea, or air<br>
transportation of persons or goods. The method involves scheduling, enhancing security<br>
and conducting administrative tasks in the transportation of persons or goods. In<br>
referring to the drawing, the single administrative office is referred to as the combined<br>
or common transportation head office, or simply the C.T. head office (11). Integrated<br>
with the C.T. head office is a verification centre (12) that ensures security related to<br>
transportation services. Reference to the C.T. head office (11) includes reference to the<br>
verification centre (12).<br>
A first function or step in the system of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is registering persons using the system including any transporters of<br>
goods or services (14) and any person seeking transportation services (15). Essentially,<br>
all of the participants in a transportation system using this system are first registered<br>
with the C.T. head office. Registering persons, or registration of persons, optionally<br>
involves a contractual commitment between such persons and the C.T. head office to<br>
either use the C.T. head office for, or subsequently report to the C.T. head office on,<br>
their transportation transactions, i.e., the transportation details of a transaction<br>
conducted directly between the transporter and a passenger or shipper.<br>
Registering a transporter (14) means receiving business information, typically including<br>
registry of means of transport (3) offered by the transporter, business location, local<br>
authorities (6), accident and rescue system (7), governmental tax office (8), insurance<br>
providers (9), insurance regulatory agency (9), transportation capabilities (2), state<br>
transport authority (5), state police (4), background information about employees on<br>
any complaints, criminal record (1), licenses, restrictions on licenses, administrative<br>
fines and punishments, and interactions with law enforcement and other authorities.<br>
Registering a shipper or passenger (15) includes receiving personal information to<br>
confirm identity and payment information. Personal information may include name,<br>
address, passport number, driver's license number, eye, voice and finger prints, DNA,<br>
photograph, and payment information. Registration enables the C.T. head office to keep<br>
a pre-paid reserve account for a passenger and shipper from which the passenger or<br>
shipper may pay the transport charges. Registration diminishes the importance of a<br>
travel ticket by providing for the credentialing of the person before traveling.<br>
Registration of both the shipper or passenger and the transporter promotes the safety<br>
and effectiveness of the transport system by enabling identity verification methods of the<br>
passenger or shipper and also of the technical capabilities of the means of transport,<br>
such as vehicle capabilities, train car capacities, number of seats, etc. The combination<br>
of an administrative office and a verification centre enables registration to deliver greater<br>
confidence in trustworthy participants and simplifies payment for the transport charges.<br>
Having a central administrative office for a plurality of transporters is a type of cost<br>
sharing that expands the potential to accept all manner of payment, including debt or<br>
third party guaranties that may be provided by the passenger or shipper to the C.T.<br>
head office.<br>
The C.T. head office archives and evaluates the registration information it receives, and<br>
it is typically included in a data base to permit fast and accurate processing and<br>
elaboration of the data when needed. Evaluation may simply mean confirming<br>
transportation credentials of a transporter. For example, a transporter typically has a<br>
license for using his means of transport and registration enables confirmation of this<br>
license.<br>
The registration process enables the C.T. head office contract with a transporter to<br>
include benefits or incentives for meeting published transport conditions, such as<br>
schedule and route compliance. The benefits, for example, may include cash, driving<br>
fuel, and discounts for other costs. Penalties for poor performance may also be included<br>
in a contract with a transporter.<br>
Similarly, the registration process enables the C.T. head office to contract with<br>
passengers or shippers to include sanctions for not meeting obligations agreed to in<br>
reserving transport. Safety and reliability is enhanced by saving data on the routes of<br>
transporters and passengers that executed the transport or carriage.<br>
Contract sanctions or rewards may only be included in due regard to the external rules<br>
and regulations of a country in which the transport transaction is carried out.<br>
A second function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by<br>
the C.T. head office is providing identification documentation for each registered<br>
transporter and each registered person.<br>
A third function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is accepting a reservation for transportation services from any registered<br>
person;<br>
A fourth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by<br>
the C.T. head office is performing a security check of each registered person including<br>
verifying the identity of each such person and checking for any criminal records<br>
associated with that person. This step is performed by the verification centre (12) of the<br>
C.T. head office (11) using any of the available verification methods (16). For any<br>
passenger, shipper or transporter this means examining the identification card provided<br>
to the person, examining the person's electronic signature, comparing a PIN number or<br>
password used by the person with an authorized PIN number, using an eye, voice or<br>
finger print or the DNA record of the person compared with that on file, or performing a<br>
photograph comparison and using a camera to compare file records with current<br>
appearance.<br>
A function of the security check is, for example, to find limitations and qualifications of a<br>
driver of a vehicle used for transportation of persons or goods. This requires checking<br>
with appropriate authorities and institutions. Such a check would typically include<br>
confirming the validity of an operator's license for the type of vehicle, such as an<br>
automobile, airplane, or ship, so used.<br>
The security check optionally involves verifying the validity of transporters stated<br>
capabilities for its means of transport and of the technical certificate of the vehicle from<br>
police, tax office or a competent authority.<br>
The security check optionally involves checking criminal record and traffic infractions of<br>
transporters and passengers or shippers from the authorities or using a central criminal<br>
record database.<br>
The security check optionally involves checking the validity of the transporter's insurance<br>
from the insurance provider or from a regulatory agency of insurers or other competent<br>
authority.<br>
A function of verification centre is to elaborate and evaluate information received from<br>
transporters, passengers or shippers, authorities, insurers, and others. Such information<br>
includes on-time performance of a transporter, a transporter's observance of rules, date<br>
and time of transport. The results from such elaboration and evaluation are used to<br>
assess the capability of the participants to make use of this transport system.<br>
The verification centre (12) typically communicates with the shipper or passenger (15),<br>
transporter or carrier (14), and the employee operating the transporter means of<br>
transport (18) using direct person to person contact or indirect contact using available<br>
services (13), such as a mobile phone, land line telephone, the Internet, facsimile, a<br>
satellite system, text messaging commonly referred to as Short Message Service (sms)<br>
and Multimedia Messaging Service (mms), e-mail and mobile Internet.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, the C.T. head office, using the verification<br>
centre, implements a more active role in monitoring and communicating with the<br>
transporter while providing its transportation service. Such a role includes monitoring<br>
route conditions and transport regulations in different jurisdictions; communicating with<br>
the transporter about traffic conditions and changing transport regulations; and,<br>
providing a communication service for the transporter in contacting police, rescue, or<br>
others in case of an accident or emergency situation.<br>
A fifth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is choosing one or more transporters by comparing and logically<br>
searching the reservation for transportation services with the information obtained<br>
during registration on the preferences of the person making the reservation and the<br>
capabilities of each transporter. This step matches compatible transporter routes and<br>
times with the passenger or shippers requirements made known in the accepted<br>
reservation. A logical search of the information obtained on registered persons is<br>
performed to implement this step.<br>
The step of choosing one or more transporters may be controlled by pre-selection of the<br>
passenger or shipper. Pre-selection involves situations where a passenger or shipper<br>
has already decided which transporter is desired for the required transportation services,<br>
either independently of, or by pre-arrangement with, the transporter. The passenger or<br>
shipper tells the C.T. head office what transporter is desired and the choosing step is in<br>
accordance with the requirements of the passenger or shipper. While the transporter<br>
and passenger might decided to conduct their transaction independently of the C.T. head<br>
office, the C.T. head office would perform the security check, provide incentives and<br>
conduct its other functions when the transaction is placed through the C.T. head office.<br>
When the transaction is conducted independently of the C.T. head office, the contract<br>
between the transporter and the C.T. head office and the contract between the C.T. head<br>
office and the passenger or shipper would typically require the participants to send a<br>
record of the transaction and performance of the transporter to the C.T. head office for<br>
use by the verification centre. Sending a record of the transaction and performance of<br>
the transporter to the C.T. head office for transactions undertaken independently of the<br>
C.T. head office enhances the system by adding data for archiving and evaluation<br>
purposes.<br>
A sixth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is selecting among chosen transporters when more than one chosen<br>
transporter is suitable to provide the transportation services, wherein such selecting is<br>
performed by the person making the reservation or by the administrative office. When<br>
there is more than one transporter capable of meeting the preferences of the person<br>
seeking transportation services, the person making the reservation is given the option to<br>
state a preference. If that person has no preference, the C.T. head office makes the<br>
selection.<br>
A seventh function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by<br>
the C.T. head office is providing an order for transportation services to said one or more<br>
chosen transporters consistent with the reservations and the security check. Typically,<br>
an order is placed if the transporter meets the passenger or shipper's requirements for<br>
transportation, if the party making the reservation pays the C.T. head office for the<br>
transport charges, and if the identity of the participants is verified.<br>
This step satisfies an important task of the C.T. head office to identify the passenger's<br>
or shipper's payment. Use of the C.T. head office expands on the potential to work with<br>
a passenger or shipper to identify credit and other sources of payment. These might<br>
include payment only from a personal checking account, the use of standard payment<br>
orders, mobile phone orders, Internet orders, payment from a reserve account, in-<br>
person payment at the assigned places, payment by post, payment using financial<br>
assets, payment using a fidelity bonus, payment on credit with repayment on a<br>
schedule, etc.<br>
A eighth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by<br>
the C.T. head office is confirming acceptance of the order by said one or more chosen<br>
transporters. The transporter typically confirms either passenger carriage or shipment of<br>
goods, and the price, method of transport, date, time and route.<br>
A ninth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is notifying each registered person seeking transportation services of<br>
said one or more chosen transporters and of conditions for such transportation services.<br>
Such notification relates mainly to data on the transportation meeting the reservation<br>
requirements and the details of the services, e.g. the transporter (carrier) number,<br>
identification codes of the means of transport, date and time of the transportation, the<br>
route, remuneration for the transport, etc.<br>
A tenth function or step in the method of the preferred embodiment implemented by the<br>
C.T. head office is receiving payment for the transportation services.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Transporter (14) and a passenger or shipper (15) register themselves in the C.T. head<br>
office (11) and obtain an identification cards. In the registration process, the transporter<br>
(14) provides all required data on its means of transport (18), which it will use in<br>
providing its service. Similarly, the passenger or shipper (15) provides all required data<br>
involving personal identity and, if transportation of goods (17) is involved, the kind of<br>
transported goods to be consigned.<br>
The registered passenger or shipper (15) informs the C.T. head office (11) about a<br>
requirement for transport, specifies the date and time, the boarding point or place of<br>
embarkation, the destination, desired means of transport (18) and the goods for<br>
consignment (17) if a shipment is required. The passenger or shipper (15) identifies<br>
himself to the C.T. head office (11) in the form of electronic signature and password<br>
through e-mail. The registered transporter (14), who is chosen by the C.T. head office<br>
(11), replies to the C.T. head office (11) confirming the planned carriage; specifies<br>
means of transport (18), the route, time of departure and expected time of arrival,<br>
number of free transport places, and other data relevant the transportation ordered. The<br>
transporter (14) identifies himself using the identification card (16) issued by the C.T.<br>
head office and the password by communication (13) using a mobile telephone. The C.T.<br>
head office (11) saves and evaluates the data, the verification centre (12) verifies<br>
identity of the transporter (14) and capability of the means of transport (18) proposed<br>
for transport execution.<br>
The C.T. head office (11) informs the passenger or shipper (15) by communication (13)<br>
using a by telephone phone about the transport, which meets the passenger or shipper's<br>
reservation criteria, states the fare, provides any conditions required by the transporter,<br>
and asks for and receives payment. The C.T. head office (11) confirms the payment and<br>
informs the transporter (14) about completion of the order. The transporter (14) sends a<br>
binding commitment to the C.T. head office (11) that may be used to send to the<br>
participants confirming the agreed upon transport. After conclusion of the transport, the<br>
transporter (14) informs the C.T. head office (11) about its execution. The C.T. head<br>
office (11) informs the transporter (14) about any benefits for prompt transport<br>
execution or penalties in failing to meet published transport conditions. The C.T. head<br>
office (11) saves and evaluates data associated with the transportation event.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A transporter (14) and passenger (15) have already registered themselves in the C.T.<br>
head office (11); each of them has an identification card (16) issued by the C.T. head<br>
office. Each has already read and understood the conditions for use of this system. At a<br>
established ticket office, the passenger (15) makes an agreement with the transporter<br>
(14) about transport to a destination by the transporter's means of transport (18). Both<br>
the transporter (14) and the passenger (15) confirm their identity using data from the<br>
identification cards issued to them by the C.T. head office. The transporter (14) informs<br>
the C.T. head office (11) by communication (13) through mobile phone in the form of<br>
Multimedia Messaging Service about the route, date and time of the transport agreed<br>
and identification codes of the passenger (15); the passenger (15) provides information<br>
by communication (13) in a similar way. The C.T. head office (11) processes the<br>
received data, verifies the participants and the state of account of the passenger (15).<br>
The office consequently informs the transporter by communication (13) through Short<br>
Message Service to his mobile phone that the passenger (15) and the payments have<br>
been verified.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION<br>
This invention may be used to manage all kinds of transport where it is necessary and<br>
convenient to perform verification of payment for transport charges in combination with<br>
identity verification of the participants. Utilization is especially suitable in the transport of<br>
