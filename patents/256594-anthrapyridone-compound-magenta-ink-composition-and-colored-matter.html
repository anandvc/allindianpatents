DESCRIPTION ANTHRAPYRIDONE COMPOUND, MAGENTA INK COMPOSITION AND<br>
COLORED MATTER<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel anthrapyridone Compound, a magenta ink composition comprising the anthrapyridone Compound and a colored matter obtained by using the same.<br>
Background of the Invention [0002]<br>
For a recording method by means of an inkjet printer which is a typical method among various color recording methods, various methods of discharging ink have been developed, and any of them performs recording by generating ink droplets and depositing them onto various record-receiving materials (such as paper, film and cloth). This method has been rapidly prevailing lately and is expected to grow remarkably in the future because of such features as little noise generation due to no contact of a recording head with a record-receiving material and easiness in downsizing, speedup and colorization.<br>
Conventionally, as an ink for a fountain pen or a feit pen and an ink for inkjet recording, a water-based ink dissolving a water-soluble dye in an aqueous medium has been used, and in these water-soluble inks, a water-soluble organic solvent is generally added to prevent ink from clogging at a pen tip or an inkjet nozzle. These conventional inks are required to provide a recorded image with sufficient density, not to clog at a pen tip or an inkjet nozzle, to dry quickly on a record-receiving material, to bleed less, to have good storage stability, and the like, and a formed image is required to have fastnesses such as water fastness, light fastness, and moisture fastness.<br><br>
Meanwhile, when an image or character Information on a color display of a Computer is recorded in color by an inkjet printer, they are generally rendered using subtractive color mixing of four color inks, yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K). In order to reproduce, as faithfully as possible, their hues of an image by additive color mixing of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) on a CRT display and the like, with an image by subtractive color mixing, each of Y, M and C is desired to have such hue as dose to each Standard as possible and vividness. In addition, it is required that an ink composition to be used for it is stable in storage for a long period of time, and that an printed image has a high concentration and excellent fastnesses such as water fastness, light fastness and gas fastness. [0004]<br>
Application of an inkjet printer is expanding in ränge from a compact printer for office to a large printer for industry, and fastnesses such as water fastness, moisture fastness, light fastness and gas fastness are required more than ever. Water fastness has been improved substantially by coating organic or inorganic fine particles which can adsorb coloring matter in ink, such as porous silica, cation-based polymer, aluminasol or special ceramics on the surface of paper, together with PVA resin and the like. Moisture fastness means durability against the phenomenon that coloring matter of dye in record-receiving material bleeds when colored record-receiving material is stored under a high humid atmosphere. Bleeding of coloring matter of dye leads to extremely deteriorating an image quality level especially in an image requiring high-definition image quality like photo tone, so it is important to cause as little bleeding as possible. Because any technique to improve light fastness greatly has not established yet and especially many types of coloring matter of magenta among 4 primary colors of Y , M , C and K are originally weak in light fastness, its improvement is an important problem. In addition, along with the recent penetration of digital cameras, the Chance to print a photo at home is also increased, and discoloration of a printed image caused by oxidizing gas in the air<br><br>
when the obtained printed article is stored is acknowledged as a problem. Oxidizing gas has a property to react with dye on or in recording paper to discolor or fade a printed image. Among oxidizing gases, ozone gas is considered as the main causative substance to promote the phenomenon of fading an inkjet recorded image. Because the phenomenon of discoloration or fading is characteristics of inkjet image, improvement of ozone gas fastness is also an important problem, as well as improvement of light fastness. [0005]<br>
As a coloring matter structure of coloring matter for magenta to be used water-soluble ink for inkjet recording, xanthene-based coloring matter and azo-based coloring matter using H acid is typical. Xanthene-based one is, however, very excellent in hue and vividness but very inferior in light fastness. Some types of azo-based coloring matter using H acid are good in terms of hue and water fastness but inferior in light fastness, gas fastness and vividness. Some magenta dyes of this type has been developed to have excellent vividness and light fastness, but their level of light fastness is still inferior to that of dye of such other hues as cyan dye, yellow dye and the like which are typified by copper phthalocyanine-based coloring matter. [0006]<br>
Anthrapyridone-based coloring matter is exemplified as a coloring matter structure of coloring matter for magenta which is excellent in vividness and light fastness (for example, Patent Literatures 1 to 8), however, any type of anthrapyridone-based coloring matter that satisfies all of hue, vividness, light fastness, water fastness, gas fastness and Solution stability has not been provided yet.

Effect of the Invention<br><br>
An anthrapyridone Compound represented by Formula (1) of the present invention has characteristics to express a highly vivid and brilliant hue on inkjet recording paper and be excellent in water-solubility and good in filtration property on a membrane filter in the process of producing an ink composition. In an ink composition of the present invention using this Compound, crystal precipitation, change in physical property, color change after storage for a long period of time and the like doesn't occur, and storage stability is good. A printed article using a magenta ink for inkjet recording comprising an anthrapyridone Compound of the present invention exhibits an ideal magenta hue without selecting a record-receiving material (paper, film and the like). A magenta ink composition of the present invention can also faithfully reproduce the hue of a photo tone color image on paper. In addition, when recording is performed on a record-receiving material the surface of which is coated with inorganic fine particles like photo quality inkjet paper (film), it provides good fastnesses such as light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness and excellent storage stability for a long period of time of a photo tone recorded image. Thus, an anthrapyridone Compound represented by Formula (1) is extremely useful as coloring matter to be used for an ink for inkjet recording.<br>

Further, after the wet cake is dissolved in water again and then hydrochloric acid is added thereto to adjust the pH at 1 to 2 to obtain a crystal, the crystal can be filtered to obtain a Compound of Formula (1) in free acid form (or partially as sodium salt itself). Furthermore, while the free acid wet cake being stirred together with water, for example, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonia<br><br>
water or a Compound represented by Formula (A) are added thereto to turn it to alkaline, and to obtain each corresponding potassium salt, lithium salt, ammonium salt and organic salt. Among the salts, especially preferable ones are salts of lithium, ammonium and sodium as described above. [0037]<br>
Next, specific examples of an anthrapyridone Compound represented by Formula (1) of the present invention are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, (K) means a monocarboxy group and 2(K) means a dicarboxy group, respectively. [0038] [Table 1]<br><br>
[0039]<br>
An anthrapyridone Compound represented by Formula (1) of the present invention can be produced by, for example, the following method.<br>

[0041]<br>
(wherein, R has the same meaning as in the above Formula (1))<br>
and 2 to 2.4 mols of 2,4,6-trichloro-S-triazine (cyanuric Chloride) are reacted in water<br>
at pH 2 to 7 at a reaction temperature of 5 to 35°C for 2 to 8 hours to obtain a<br>
Compound represented by the following Formula (8),<br>
[0042]<br>
[KA 11]<br><br>
[0043]<br>
(wherein, R has the same meaning as in Formula (1))<br>
as a first condensation product. Said resulting Compound is reacted with   2 mols of<br>
carboxy-substituted phenols corresponding to a group represented by Formula (2) at<br>
pH 7 to 9 at a reaction temperature of 5 to 90°C for 10 minutes to 5 hours to obtain a<br>

Subsequently, the Compound represented by Formula (9) obtained above is reacted with a Compound corresponding to a cross linking group X, to obtain an objective Compound of Formula (1) (represented newly by Formula (10) as shown below).<br>
For example, in order to obtain a Compound where a cross linking group X is a group having amino groups at the both ends, the Compound represented by the above Formula (9) is reacted with 1 mol of a diamino Compound of the following Formula (14) [0046]<br>

(wherein, A has the same meaning as in Formula (1), m and n 1 have the same meanings described in the above section of a cross linking group) for 10 minutes to 8 hours under conditions that the pH is 8 to 10 and the temperature is approximately 50 to  100°C,  to  obtain  a Compound where X is the above<br><br>
-N(H)m(-A-)niN(H)m- in the following Formula (10) (same as Formula (1))<br>
