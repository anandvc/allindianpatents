				<td>This invention relates to a data processing apparatus, ore particularly, this invention relates to data processing sing multiple sets of program instruction words.<br>
Data processing systems operate with a processor core acting under control of program instruction words, which when decoded serve to generate core control signals to control the different elements with the processor to perform the necessary operations to achieve the processing specified in the program instruction word.<br>
It is known to provide systems that operate with more than one instruction set (e.g. the VAX11 computers of Digital Equipment Corporation have a VAX instruction mode and a compatibility mode that enables them to decode the instructions for the earlier PDP11 computers). Such systems have typically incorporated a separate instruction decoder for each instruction set. Instruction decoders are relatively complex and large circuit elements.<br>
The space that an integrated circuit occupies is at a premium. The smaller an integrated circuit is, the less expensive it will be to manufacture and the higher the manufacturing yield. In addition, additional space will be made available upon the integrated circuit for use by other circuit elements. Measures that reduce the size of an integrated circuit are strongly advantageous.<br>
Viewed from one aspect this invention provides apparatus for processing data, said apparatus comprising:<br>
a processor core responsive to a plurality of core control signals;<br>
decoding means for decoding P bits of an X-bit program instruction word of a first instruction set to generate said core control signals;<br>
an instruction pipeline through which instruction program words are passed to said decoding means; and<br>
first mapping means responsive to a Y-bit program instruction word of a second instruction set passing along said instruction pipeline for mapping Q bits of said Y-bit program instruction word to said P bits of a corresponding X-bit program instruction word for decoding by said decoding means, wherein<br>
Y is less than X, and said second instruction set is a subset of said first instruction set.<br>
The invention operates with systems incorporating an instruction pipeline and serves to map instructions from a second instruction set to a first instruction set as they pass along the instruction pipeline. Translating the program instruction words from a second instruction set to those of a first; instruction sot avoids the need for a second instruction decoder and enables a simpler and more efficient embodiment of the rest of the processor core. The invention recognises that if the second instruction set is made to be a subset of the first instruction set, then a one to one mapping is possible and this may be achieved in a sufficiently regular and quick manner so as not to restrict system performance. Furthermore, the invention recognises that only some of the bits of the instructions from the second instruction set need to be mapped to corresponding bits of instruction words within the first instruction set to actually drive the decoding means. This increases the speed at which the mapping may be performed.<br>
The speed of instruction decoding is enhanced in preferred embodiments by the provision of an instruction register for holding an X-bit instruction being executed by said processor core, said processor core reading operand values from said instruction register.<br>
In this way, the operands from within an instruction which do not require decoding by an instruction decoder but merely acting upon by the processor core, can be directly read from the instruction rather than having to pass through the instruction decoder.<br>
In order to facilitate this arrangement whereby the critical P bits needed for driving the decoding means are generated rapidly and yet the full X-bit program instruction word is subsequently generated for unmodified use by the processor core, preferred embodiments of the invention comprise second mapping means for mapping operand values within said Y-bit program instruction word within said instruction pipeline to corresponding positions within said corresponding X-bit program instruction word and storing said mapped operand values in said instruction register for use by said processor core.<br>
The sepond mapping means could merely serve to map those operand values that are required by the processor core. However, the design of the instruction decoders can be effectively separated from that of the<br>
said Y-bit program instruction words.<br>
The use by the second instruction set of a subset of the registers used by the first instruction set enables a one to one mapping between instructions still to be achieved and yet provides for the smaller bit sizes of the second instruction set.<br>
In order to deal with the different manner of handling the registers between the instruction sets, said second mapping means extends said register operands of said Y-bit program instruction words to produce said register operands of said X-bit program instruction words.<br>
In a similar manner, other operands within the second instruction set have a reduced range compared to those of the first instruction set and are zero extended at their high order end during mapping by the second mapping means.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a method of processing data, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
a processor core responsive to a plurality of core control signals;<br>
decoding P bits of an X-bit program instruction word of a first instruction set with a decoding means to generate core control signals for controlling a processor core;<br>
passing instruction program words through an instruction pipeline through to said decoding means; and<br>
mapping Q bits of a Y-bit program instruction word of a second instruction set passing along said instruction pipeline to said P bits of a corresponding X-bit program instruction word for decoding by said decoding means, wherein<br>
Y is less than X, and said second instruction set is a subset of said first instruction set.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for data processing apparatus, comprising:<br>
a processor core (2) responsive to a plurality of core<br>
control signals;<br>
a decoder (18) connected to said processor core (2) for<br>
decoding P bits of an X-bit program instruction word of a<br>
first  instruction set  to generate  said core  control<br>
signals;<br>
an instruction pipeline means  (16)  connected to said<br>
decoder (18) through which instruction program words are<br>
passed to said decoder; and<br>
a Q to P bit mapper means  (3 8),  connected to said<br>
instruction pipeline means (16), for mapping Q bits of a<br>
Y-bit program instruction word of a second instruction<br>
set.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a data processing apparatus incorporating a processor core and a memory system;<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates an instruction and instruction decoder for a system having a single instruction set;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an instruction pipeline and instruction decoders for use in a system having two instruction sets;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the decoding of an X-bit program instruction word;<br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the mapping of Y-bit program instruction words to X-bit program instruction words;<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an X-bit instruction set;<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a Y-bit.instruction set; and<br>
Figure 9 illustrates the processing registers available to the first instruction set and the second instruction sot.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a data processing system (that is formed as part of an integrated circuit) comprising a processor core 2 coupled to a Y-bit memory system 4.  In this case, Y is equal to 16.<br>
The processor core 2 includes a register bank 6, a Booths multiplier 8, a barrel shifter 10, a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit 12 and a write data register 14. Interposed between the processor core 2 and the memory system 4 is an instruction pipeline 16, an instruction decoder 18 and a read data register 20. A program counter register 22, which is part of the processor core 2, is shown addressing the memory system '4. A program counter incrementer 2l serves to increment the program counter value within the program counter register 22 as each instruction is executed and a new instruction must be fetched for the instruction pipeline 16.<br>
The processor core 2 incorporates N-bit data pathways (in this case 32-bit data pathways) between the various functional units. In operation, instructions within the instruction pipeline 16 are decoded by the instruction decoder 18 which produces various core control signals that are passed to the different functional elements within the processor core 2. In response to these core control signals, the different portions of the processor core conduct 32-bit processing operations, such as 32-bit multiplication, 32-bit addition and 32-bit logical operations.<br>
The register bank 6 includes a current programming status register 26 and a saved programming status register 28. The current programming status register 26 holds various condition and status flags for the processor core 2. These flags may include processing mode flags (e.g. system mode, user mode, memory abort mode etc.) as well as flags indicating the occurrence of zero results in arithmetic operations, carries and the like.   The saved programming status<br>
6-<br>
register 28 (which may be one of a banked plurality of such saved programming status registers) is used to temporarily store the contents of the current programming status register 26 if an exception occurs that triggers a processing mode switch. In this way, exception handling can be made faster and more efficient.<br>
Included within the current programming status register 26 is an instruction set flag T. This instruction set flag is supplied to the instruction decoder 18 and the program counter incrementer 2l. When this instruction set flag T is set, the system operates with the instructions of the second instruction set (i.e. Y-bit program instruction words, in this case l6-bit program instruction words). The instruction set flag T controls the program counter incrementer 24 to adopt a smaller increment step when operated with the second instruction set. This is consistent with the program instruction words of the second instruction set being smaller and so more closely spaced within the memory locations of the memory system 't.<br>
As previously mentioned, the memory system 4 is a 16-bit memory system connected via 16-bit data buses to the read data register 20 and the instruction pipeline 16. Such 16-bit memory systems are simpler and inexpensive relative to higher performance 32-bit memory systems. Using such a 16-bit memory system, 16-bit program instruction words can be fetched in a single cycle. However, if 32-bit instructions from the second instruction set are to be used (as indicated by the instruction set flag T) , then two instruction fetches are required to recover a single 32-bit instruction for the instruction pipeline 16.<br>
Once the required program instruction words have been recovered from the memory system 4, they are decoded by the instruction decoder 18 and initiate 32-bit processing within the processor core 2 irrespective of whether the instructions are 16-bit instructions or 32-bit instructions.<br>
The instruction decoder 18 is illustrated in Figure 1 as a single block. However, in order to deal with more than one instruction set, the instruction decoder 18 has a more complicated structure as will be discussed in relation to Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the instruction pipeline 16 and an instruction decoder 18 for coping with a single instruction set. In this case, the instruction decoder 18 includes only a first decoding<br>
means 30 that is operative to decode 32-bit instructions. This decoding means 30 decodes the first instruction set (the ARM instruction set) utilising a programmable logic array (PLA) to produce a plurality of core control signals 32 that are fed to the processor core 2. The program instruction word which is currently decoded (i.e. yields the current the core control signals 32) is also held within an instruction register 34. Functional elements within the processor core 2 (e.g. the Booths multiplier 8 or the register bank 6) read operands needed for their processing operation directly from this instruction register 34.<br>
A feature of the operation of such an arrangement is that the first decoding means 30 requires certain of its inputs (the P bits shown as solid lines emerging from the PipeC pipeline stage) early in the clock cycle in which the first decoding means operates. This is to ensure that the core control signals 32 are generated in time to drive the necessary elements within the processor core 2. The first decoding means 30 is a relatively large and slow programmable logic array structure and so such timing considerations are important.<br>
The design of such programmable logic array structures to perform instruction decoding is conventional within the art. A set of inputs are defined together with the desired outputs to be generated from those inputs. Commercially available software is then used to devise a PLA structure that will generate the specified set of outputs from the specified set of inputs.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the system of Figure 2 modified to deal with decoding a first instruction set and a second instruction set. When the first instruction set is selected by the instruction set flag T, then the system operates as described in relation to Figure 2. When the instruction set flag T indicates that the instructions in the instruction pipeline 16 are from the second instruction set, a second decoding means 36 becomes active.<br>
This second decoding means decodes the 16-bit instructions (the Thumb instructions) utilising a fast PLA 38 and a parallel slow PLA 40. The fast PLA 38 serves to map a subset (Q bits) of the bits of the 16-bit Thumb instructions to the P bits of the corresponding 32-bit ARM instructions that are required to drive the first decoding means 30. Since a relatively small number of bits are required to undergo this<br>
mapping, the fast PLA 38 can be relatively shallow and so operate quickly enough to allow the first decoding means sufficient time to generate the core control signals 32 in response to the contents of PipeC. The fast PLA 38 can be considered to act to "fake" the critical bits of a corresponding 32-bit instruction for the first decoding means without spending any unnecessary time mapping the full instruction.<br>
However, the full 32-bit instruction is still required by the processor core 2 if it is to be able to operate without radical alterations and significant additional circuit elements. With the time critical mapping having been taken care of by the fast PLA 38, the slow PLA 40 connected in parallel serves to map the l6-bit instruction to the corresponding 32-bit instruction and place this into the instruction register 34. This more complicated mapping may take place over the full time it takes the fast PLA 38 and the first decoding means 30 to operate. The important factor is that the 32-bit instruction should be present within the instruction register 3^ i-n sufficient time for any operands to be read therefrom in response to the core control signals 32 acting upon the processor core 2.<br>
It will be appreciated that the overall action of the system of Figure 3 when decoding the second instruction set is to translate 16-bit instructions from the second instruction set to 32-bit instructions from the first instruction set as they progress along the instruction pipeline 16. This is rendered n practical possibility by making the second instruction set a subset of a first instruction set so as to ensure that there is a one to one mapping of instructions from the second instructions set into instructions within the first instruction set.<br>
The provision of the instruction set flag T enables the second instruction set to be non-orthogonal to the first instruction set. This is particularly useful in circumstances where the first instruction set is an existing instruction set without any free bits that could be used to enable an orthogonal further instruction set to be detected and decoded.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the decoding of a 32-bit instruction. At the top of Figure 4 successive processing clock cycles are illustrated in which a fetch operation, a decode operation and finally an execute operation performed.  If the particular instruction so requires (e.g.<br>
bit instruction in this case is a different type of Load/Store instruction to that illustrated in Figure 5- However, this instruction is still a subset of the single data transfer instruction of the 32-bit instruction set.<br>
Figure 7 schematically illustrates the formats of the eleven different types of instruction for the 32-bit instruction set. These instructions are in turn:<br>
1.	Data processing PSR transfer;<br>
2.	Multiply;<br>
3.	Single data swap;<br>
4.	Single data transfer;<br>
5.	Undefined;<br>
6.	Block data transfer;<br>

8.	Co-processor data transfer;<br>
9.	Co-processor data operation; and<br>
10.	Co-processor register transfer.<br>
11.	Software interrupt.<br>
A full description of this instruction set may be found in the Data Sheet of the ARM6 processor produced by Advanced RISC Machines Limited. The instruction highlighted within Figure 7 is that illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates the 16-bit instruction set that is provided in addition to the 32-bit instruction set. The instructions highlighted within this instruction set are those illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 respectively. The instructions within this 16-bit instruction set have been chosen such that they may all be mapped to a single 32-bit instruction and so form a subset of the 32-bit instruction set.<br>
