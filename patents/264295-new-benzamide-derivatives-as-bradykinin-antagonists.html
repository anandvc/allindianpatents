				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new phenylsulfamoyl benzamide derivatives of<br>
formula (I) and optical antipodes or racemates and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or<br>
solvates thereof which are useful in the treatment or prevention of painful and<br>
inflammatory processes. The present invention also relates to the processes for<br>
producing compounds of formula (I) and to pharmacological compositions containing<br>
the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Kinins are endogenous peptides formed in plasma and peripheral tissues in<br>
response to tissue injury or infection following catalytic cleavage of kininogens by<br>
kallikrein enzymes. Kinins play an important role in the pathophysiological processes<br>
accompanying pain and inflammation. Their biological actions are mediated by two G-<br>
protein coupled membrane receptors, denoted B1 and B2. Both B1 and B2 receptors<br>
have been cloned [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 184 (1992) 260-268 and<br>
J.Biol.Chem., 269 (1994) 21583-21586] and the mechanisms regulating their<br>
expression, self-maintenance and signalling function is under intensive investigations<br>
[Mol. Pharmacol., 56 (1999) 325-333 and J. Cell. Physiol 193 (2002) 275-286].<br>
The first set of kinins, bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (LysBK) preferentially act<br>
through stimulation of constitutively expressed and rapidly desensitising B2 receptors,<br>
which are widely distributed in many tissues. On the other hand, their active<br>
carboxypeptidase metabolites, the second set of kinins, desArg9BK (DABK) and<br>
LysdesArg BK (LysDABK) activate inducible and non-desensitising Bl receptors,<br>
which are rarely expressed under non-pathological conditions. Generally B1 receptors<br>
rapidly appear after injuries of various natures (tissue trauma, infections, etc.). Thus the<br>
Bl receptor up-regulation appears to be part of a generalized response that includes the<br><br>
local co-expression (eventually up-regulation) of enzymes, receptors, autacoids,<br>
cytokines and chemokines that notoriously play key roles in the early and late responses<br>
of tissues to various types of injury.<br>
In animal models it has been demonstrated that there is a switch in dominance of<br>
function from B2 to Bl in chronic inflammatory states. While the B2 receptor is<br>
implicated in the acute phase of the inflammatory and pain response, the Bl receptor is<br>
involved in the chronic phase of this response. The involvement of kinin receptors in<br>
inflammation and pain transduction has been supported by the results of studies on mice<br>
lacking bradykinin Bl receptors. Bl receptor deficient mice are different from wild-type<br>
mice in sensory functions, exhibiting increased analgesic thresholds to noxious<br>
chemical and heat stimuli, and drastic reduction in the accumulation of<br>
polymorphonuclear leukocytes at sites of inflammation [PNAS, 97 (2000) 8140-8145<br>
and Neuropharmacology 41 (2001) 1006-1012]. Furthermore the most original finding<br>
in Bl receptor deficient mice was the direct evidence for a role of central kinin<br>
receptors in nociception suggesting that the hypoalgesia seen in Bl-receptor knockout<br>
mice is partly due to reduced central sensitisation in the spinal cord. However, apart<br>
from the above changes Bl knockout mice were apparently normal without any<br>
apparent pathological changes.<br>
Apart from the evidence of basal expression of B1 receptors on the periphery<br>
recently more and more evidence shows that B1 receptors are constitutively expressed<br>
'centrally' in some neuronal elements, including the spinal cord and some higher<br>
structures as well. The function of these receptors is unclear but they have been<br>
implicated in pain transmission and hyperalgesia. Therefore, B1 receptor antagonists are<br>
believed to be useful in alleviating pain not only via peripheral sites but also to have<br>
possibly broader spectrum of analgesic effects if they block central Bl receptors as well<br>
[NeuroReport 11 (2000) 4003-4005; NeuroReport, 12 (2001) 2311-2313; Neuroscience<br>
107 (2001) 665-673 and Neuroscience Letters 294 (2000) 175-178].<br>
On the basis of scientific data bradykinin receptors are involved in mediation of<br>
pain and hyperalgesia in several ways. Bl receptor antagonists may have diverse modes<br>
of action. They have (1) indirect ('peripheral') effects on the nociceptors via inhibition<br>
of release of other algogenic mediators. N.B. Bl receptors appear upon inflammatory<br>
induction on cells adjacent to sensory neurones (macrophages, fibroblasts or endothelial<br><br><br>
cells) are involved in releasing mediators (prostaglandins, cytokines and nitric oxide)<br>
that sensitize or activate the nociceptors. (2) direct ('peripheral') effects on nociceptors<br>
expressing Bl receptors (constitutively) or upon induction and (3) 'central' effects on<br>
pain processing in the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord.<br>
Therefore, an orally active non-peptide bradykinin Bl receptor antagonist could<br>
be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain.<br>
Several patents and patent applications describe bradykinin Bl receptor<br>
antagonists which have different chemical structures. Such documents are for instance<br>
the following international patent applications: WO200075107, WO02076964,<br>
WO04054584, WO02099388, WO05004810.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have found a class of benzamide derivatives which have high affinity for<br>
bradykinin Bl receptors and selectivity over bradykinin B2 receptors. The selectivity is<br>
particularly important as the undesired side effects of the compounds are much less<br>
pronounced.<br>

The term "halogen" substituent denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine<br>
atoms. The term C1-C4 alkyl group used in the present description denotes methyl, ethyl,<br>
normal- and isopropyl and different butyl groups. These C1-C4 alkyl groups can be in<br>
the C1-C4 alkoxy groups and C1-C4 hydroxyalkyl groups.<br>
The 4-7 membered heterocyclic ring in the meaning of Ra and Rb can be e.g.<br>
piperidine, pyrrolidine, piperazine, homopiperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine and<br>
the like.<br>
The 4-7 membered heterocyclic ring in the meaning of P and B can be e.g.<br>
imidazole, triazole, oxazol, tiazole, tetrazole, furan, tetrahydrofuran, pyrimidine,<br>
pyridine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, pyrazine, piperazine, homopiperazine, morpholine,<br>
thiomorpholine and the like.<br>
The saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic 5-7 membered ring in the<br>

pyridine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, pyrazine, piperazine, homopiperazine, morpholine,<br>
thiomorpholine and the like.<br>
The invention relates also to the salts of compounds of formula (I) formed with<br>
acids or bases.<br>
Both organic and inorganic acids can be used for the formation of acid addition<br>
salts. Suitable inorganic acids can be e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and<br>
phosphoric acid. Representatives of monovalent organic acids can be e.g. formic acid,<br>
acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and different butyric acids, valeric acids<br>
and capric acids. Representatives of bivalent organic acids can be e.g. oxalic acid,<br>
malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid. Other organic acids can also<br>
11<br><br>
be used, such as hydroxy acids e.g. citric acid, tartaric acid, or aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
e.g. benzoic acid or salicylic acid, as well as aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids e.g.<br>
methanesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Especially valuable group of the acid<br>
addition salts is in which the acid component itself does not have therapeutical effect in<br>
the applied dose or it does not have unfavorable influence on the effect of the active<br>
ingredient. These acid addition salts are pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
The reason why acid addition salts, which do not belong to the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts belong to the present invention is, that in given case they<br>
can be advantageous in the purification and isolation of the desired compounds.<br>
Among the salts formed with bases especially important are the salts formed<br>
with alkali metals, e.g. sodium, potassium, alkaline-earth metals, e.g. calcium and<br>
magnesium, as well as with ammonia or organic amines. The latter bases can have<br>
further substituents, e.g. hydroxy or amino groups, which can influence e.g. the<br>
solubility and the handling of the product. The salts formed with bases are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts.<br>
According to the invention the compounds of formula (I) can be synthesized by<br>
reacting an amine derivative of formula (II)<br>
kill<br><br><br><br><br><br>
- wherein the meaning of R , R2, R3, R and R5 is as defined above - finally the latter is<br>
reacted with an amine derivative Q and the obtained phenylsulfamoyl benzamide<br>
derivative of formula (I) in given case can be transformed into an other compound of<br>
formula (I) by introducing new substituents and/or modifying or removing the existing<br>
ones, and/or salt formation and/or liberating the compound from salts.<br>
The sulfonylation reaction is preferably carried out in a proper solvent,<br>
preferably in the presence of a base. The reactions are followed by thin layer<br>
chromatography. The necessary reaction time is 6-20 h. The work-up of the reaction<br>
mixture can be carried out by different methods.<br>
a)	The reaction mixture is concentrated and the product is isolated by<br>
crystallization or extraction. If the crude product is not pure enough, then column<br>
chromatography can be used for the purification of it. The column chromatography is<br>
carried out either on normal phase using Kieselgel 60 as adsorbent and different solvent<br>
systems, e.g. n-hexane/ethyl acetate, chloroform/methanol, dichloromethane/ethyl<br>
acetate or chloroform/acetone as eluents, or on reversed phase using YMC-Pack ODS-<br>
AQ type packings (produced by YMC) and acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid or<br>
acetonitrile/water/acetic acid as eluent.<br>
b)	The reaction mixture is poured into ice-water and the product is isolated by<br>
filtration or extraction. The crude product is crystallized or purified by column<br>
chromatography as described above. The structures of the products are determined by<br>
IR, NMR and mass spectrometry.<br><br>
Hydrolysis of a compound of formula (VI) can be carried out with a base, e.g.<br>
alkali metal hydroxide, preferably sodium or lithium hydroxide, or with an acid, e.g.<br>
organic acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The amide bond formations are preferably carried out by preparing an active<br>
derivative from a carboxylic acid of formula (IV) or (VII) which is reacted with an<br>
amino acid of formula (V) or an amine Q, respectively, preferably in the presence of a<br>
base.<br>
The transformation of a carboxylic acid into an active derivative can be carried<br>
out in situ during the amide bond formation in a proper solvent (e.g.<br>
dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, chlorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons or the<br>
mixture thereof). The active derivatives can be acid chlorides (e.g. prepared from<br>
carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride), mixed anhydrides (e.g. prepared from carboxylic<br>
acid with isobutyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine), active<br>
esters (e.g. prepared from carboxylic acid with hydroxybenztriazol (HOBt) and<br>
dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide	(DCC)	or	O-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) in the presence of a base e.g.<br>
triethylamine). The active derivatives can be prepared at a temperature in the range of 0<br>
°C to room temperature. A proper amino acid of formula (V) or an amine Q is added as<br>
a base or as a salt formed with inorganic acid to the so obtained solution or suspension<br>
in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine, needed for the liberation of the amine. The<br>
condensation reactions are followed by thin layer chromatography. The necessary<br>
reaction time is 6-20 h. The work-up of the reaction mixture can be carried out by<br>
different methods.<br>
a)	The reaction mixture is concentrated, and the residue is crystallized or<br>
extracted with a proper organic solvent and in given case purified by column<br>
chromatography. The column chromatography is carried out on normal phase using<br>
Kieselgel 60 as adsorbent and different solvent systems, e.g. toluene/methanol,<br>
chloroform/methanol or toluene/acetone, as eluents or on reversed phase using YMC-<br>
Pack ODS-AQ type packings (produced by YMC) and acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic<br>
acid or acetonitrile/water/acetic acid as eluent.<br>
b)	The reaction mixture is directly purified by column chromatography as<br>
described above to yield the pure product.<br><br><br>
The structures of the products are determined by IR, NMR and mass<br>
spectrometry.<br>
The obtained benzamide derivatives of formula (I) - independently from the<br>
method of preparation - in given case can be transformed into another compound of<br>
formula (I) by introducing further substituents and/or modifying and/or removing the<br>
existing ones, and/or formation of salts with acids and/or liberating the benzamide<br>
derivative of formula (I) from the obtained acid addition salts by treatment with a base<br>
and/or the free sulfonamide derivative of formula (I) can be transformed into a salt by<br>
treatment with a base.<br>
For instance cleaving the benzyl group from N-benzyl group, which stands for<br>
Re, can be carried out e.g. with catalytic hydrogenation or with chloroethyl<br>
chloroformate in a proper solvent. The compounds of formula (I) containing free<br>
hydroxy group can be transformed into acyloxy or sulfoxy derivatives with different<br>
acylating or sulfonylating agents. The reactions can be carried out for example in<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons using acid chloride or acid anhydride as acylating agent in the<br>
presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine or sodium carbonate). The sulfonamide<br>
derivatives of formula (I) containing a nitro group can be transformed into amines by<br>
reduction and the amines can be further reacted to give acid amides as described for the<br>
acylation of hydroxy groups or carbamate derivatives can be synthesized. Ester groups<br>
can be hydrolyzed and the obtained free carboxylic acids can be transformed into<br>
amides by reacting with proper amine derivatives. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl) group can<br>
be cleaved by organic or inorganic acids (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen chloride).<br>
Cyano groups can be transformed into amide, N-hydroxy-amidine or different N-<br>
containing heterocyclic groups.<br>
Most of the amino acids of formula (V) and amines Q are either commercially<br>
available or can be synthesized by different known methods. The syntheses of some<br>
new amines Q are described in the Examples. Following these procedures the other<br>
amines Q can also be prepared.<br>
The compounds of the present invention as well as their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts or hydrates or solvates can be used as such or suitably in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions (drugs) can be in solid, liquid or<br><br><br>
semiliquid form and pharmaceutical adjuvant and auxiliary materials can be added,<br>
which are commonly used in practice, such as carriers, excipients, diluents, stabilizers,<br>
wetting or emulsifying agents, pH- and osmotic pressure-influencing, flavoring or<br>
aromatizing, as well as formulation-promoting or formulation-providing additives.<br>
The dosage required to exert the therapeutical effect can vary within wide limits<br>
and will be fitted to the individual requirements in each of the particular case,<br>
depending on the stage of the disease, the condition and the bodyweight of the patient to<br>
be treated, as well as the sensitivity of the patient against the active ingredient, route of<br>
administration and number of daily treatments. The actual dose of the active ingredient<br>
to be used can safely be determined by the attending physician skilled in the art in the<br>
knowledge of the patient to be treated.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient according to<br>
the present invention usually contain 0.01 to 100 mg of active ingredient in a single<br>
dosage unit. It is, of course possible that the amount of the active ingredient in some<br>
compositions exceeds the upper or lower limits defined above.<br>
The solid forms of the pharmaceutical compositions can be e.g. tablets, dragees,<br>
capsules, pills or lyophilized powder ampoules useful for the preparation of injections.<br>
Liquid compositions are the injectable and infusable compositions, fluid medicines,<br>
packing fluids and drops. Semiliquid compositions can be ointments, balsams, creams,<br>
shaking mixtures and suppositories.<br>
For the sake of a simple administration it is suitable if the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprise dosage units containing the amount of the active ingredient to be<br>
administered once, or a few multiples or a half, third or fourth part thereof. Such dosage<br>
units are e.g. tablets, which can be powdered with grooves promoting the halving or<br>
quartering of the tablet in order to exactly administer the required amount of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Tablets can be coated with an acid-soluble layer in order to assure the release of<br>
the active ingredient content after leaving the stomach. Such tablets are enteric-coated.<br>
A similar effect can be achieved also by encapsulating the active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can contain e.g. lactose<br>
or starch as excipients, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidine or starch paste as binders or granulating agents. Potato starch or<br><br><br>
microcrystalline cellulose is added as disintegration agents, but ultraamylopectin or<br>
formaldehyde casein can also be used. Talcum, colloidic silicic acid, stearin, calcium or<br>
magnesium stearate can be used as antiadhesive and lubricants.<br>
The tablets can be manufactured e.g. by wet granulation, followed by pressing.<br>
The mixed active ingredients and excipients, as well as in given case part of the<br>
disintegrants are granulated with an aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous alcoholic solution of<br>
the binders in an appropriate equipment, then the granulate is dried. The other<br>
disintegrants, lubricants and antiadhesive agents are added to the dried granulate, and<br>
the mixture is pressed to a tablet. In given case the tablets are made with halving groove<br>
to ease the administration.<br>
The tablets can be made directly from the mixture of the active ingredient and<br>
the proper auxiliaries by pressing. In given case, the tablets can be coated by using<br>
additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical practice, e.g. stabilizers, flavoring,<br>
coloring agents, such as sugar, cellulose derivatives (methyl- or ethylcellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, etc), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, calcium phosphate, calcium<br>
carbonate, food coloring agents, food laces, aroma agents, iron oxide pigments, etc. In<br>
the case of capsules the mixture of the active ingredient and the auxiliaries is filled into<br>
capsules.<br>
Liquid oral compositions, e.g. suspensions, syrups, elixirs can be made by using<br>
water, glycols, oils, alcohols, coloring and flavoring agents.<br>
For rectal administration the composition is formulated in suppositories or<br>
clysters. The suppository can contain beside the active ingredient a carrier, so called<br>
adeps pro suppository. Carriers can be vegetable oils, such as hydrogenated vegetable<br>
oils, triglycerides of C12-C18 fatty acids (preferably the carriers under the trade name<br>
Witepsol). The active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with the melted adeps pro<br>
suppository and the suppositories are moulded.<br>
For parenteral administration the composition is formulated as injection solution.<br>
For manufacturing the injection solution the active ingredients are dissolved in distilled<br>
water and/or in different organic solvents, such as glycolethers, in given case in the<br>
presence of solubilizers, e.g. polioxyethylensorbitane-monolaurate, -monooleate, or<br>
monostearate (Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80). The injection solution can also contain<br>
different auxiliaries, such as conserving agents, e.g. ethylendiamine tetraacetate, as well<br><br><br>
as pH adjusting agents and buffers and in given case local anaesthetic, e.g. lidocain. The<br>
injection solution containing the active ingredient of the invention is filtered before it is<br>
filled into ampoules, and it is sterilized after filling.<br>
If the active ingredient is hygroscopic, then it can be stabilized by liophylization.<br>

Biological evaluation<br>
Functional assay:<br>
Assessment of antagonist potency at Bl and B2 receptors in vitro by measurement<br>
of cytosolic calcium ion concentration with a plate reader fluorimeter in cells<br>
expressing recombinant human Bl or B2 receptors<br>
Cell culture<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing recombinant human Bl<br>
(CHO-B1, Euroscreen) or B2 (CHO-B2, Perkin-Elmer) receptors were cultured in<br>
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum<br>
(FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 |ug/ml amphotericin B, 1%<br>
Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM), non essential amino acid solution, 600<br>
Hg/ml G418, 1% pyruvate (for the B2 cell line). Cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified<br>
incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air and were passaged 1:4 three times a<br>
week. Cells were plated at 1.5-2.5xlO4 cell/well on standard 96-well microplates,<br>
measurements of cytosolic calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]j ) were carried out 1-2<br>
days after cell plating.<br><br>
Fluorimetric measurement of cytosolic calcium concentration<br>
Measurements of [Ca2+]j were carried out on CHO-B1 and CHO-B2 cells stably<br>
expressing human Bl and B2 receptors, respectively. Cells were grown in standard 96-<br>
well microplates and before the measurement were loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+-<br>
sensitive dye, fluo-4/AM (2 uM): after removing the culture medium the dye was added<br>
to the cells (dissolved in assay buffer: 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM<br>
CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 20 mM D-glucose, 2 mM probenecid, 100 ul/well) and cells<br>
were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air<br>
for 40-120 min. To stop dye loading cells were washed twice with assay buffer. After<br>
washing, various concentrations of the test compounds (diluted in extracellular medium<br>
from a DMSO stock solution, final DMSO concentration was 
added to each well depending on the experimental setup. After incubation at 37°C for<br>
20-25 min. baseline and agonist-evoked changes of [Ca2+]; were measured column by<br>
column with a plate reader fluorimeter (Fluoroskan Ascent, Labsystems). Excitation and<br>
detection of emission was carried out from the bottom of the plate. Filters used for Fluo-<br>
4: excitation filter - 485 nm, emission filter - 538 nm. The whole measurement process<br>
was performed at 37°C and was controlled by custom software. Inhibitory potency of<br>
the test compounds was assessed by measuring the reduction in the agonist-evoked<br>
[Ca2+]i-elevation in the presence of different concentrations of the compounds. The<br>
agonists were LysDABK for CHO-B1, and bradykinin for CHO-B2 cells. Agonists<br>
were applied at an ECso concentration, the ECso-values were derived from daily<br>
determined dose-response curves. Fluorescence data were expressed as AF/F<br>
(fluorescence change normalized to baseline). All treatments on a single plate were<br>
measured in multiple wells. Data from all wells with the same treatment were averaged<br>
and the average values were used for analysis. Inhibitory potency of a compound at a<br>
single concentration point was expressed as percent inhibition of the control agonist<br>
response. Sigmoidal concentration-inhibition curves were fitted to the data (derived<br>
from at least three independent experiments) and ICso-values were determined as the<br>
concentration that produces half of the maximal inhibition caused by the compound.<br><br>
