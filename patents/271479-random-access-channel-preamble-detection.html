RANDOM ACCESS CHANNEL PREAMBLE DETECTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to random access channel (RACH) procedure in a<br>
cellular communications network, and in particular to a method and apparatus for<br>
detecting a RACH preamble signal. While it is described below in the context of a<br>
long term evolution (LTE) type cellular network for illustrative purposes and since it<br>
happens to be well suited to that context, those skilled in the art will recognise that the<br>
invention disclosed herein can also be applied to various other types of cellular<br>
networks.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a 3rd Generation (3G)<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system operating in Wideband Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (WCDMA) based on a European standard known as Global System<br>
for Mobile Communications (GSM), and general packet radio services (GPRS). The<br>
LTE of UMTS is under discussion by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)<br>
that standardised UMTS.<br>
3GPP LTE is a technology for enabling high-speed packet communications.<br>
Many schemes have been proposed for the LTE objective including those that aim to<br>
reduce user and provider costs, improve service quality, and expand and improve<br>
coverage and system capacity. 3G LTE requires reduced cost per bit, increased<br>
service availability, flexible use of a frequency band, a simple structure, an open<br>
interface, and adequate power consumption of a terminal as an upper-level<br>
requirement.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a network structure of an evolved universal<br>
mobile telecommunication system (E-UMTS). The E-UMTS may be also referred to<br>
as an LTE system. The communication network is widely deployed to provide a<br>
variety of communication services such as voice and packet data.<br><br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the E-UMTS network includes an evolved UMTS<br>
terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) and an evolved packet core (EPC) and<br>
one or more user equipments (UEs) 101. The E-UTRAN may include one or more<br>
evolved NodeBs (eNodeB, or eNB) 103, and a plurality of UEs 101 may be located in<br>
one cell. One or more E-UTRAN mobility management entity (MME)/system<br>
architecture evolution (SAE) gateways 105 may be positioned at the end of the<br>
network and connected to an external network.<br>
As used herein, "downlink" refers to communication from an eNodeB 103 to a UE<br>
101, and "uplink" refers to communication from the UE 101 to an eNodeB 103. UE<br>
101 refers to communication equipment carried by a user and may be also be referred<br>
to as a mobile station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS) or a<br>
wireless device.<br>
An eNodeB 103 provides end points of a user plane and a control plane to the UE<br>
101. MME/SAE gateway 105 provides an end point of a session and mobility<br>
management function for UE 101. The eNodeB 103 and the MME/SAE gateway 105<br>
may be connected via an S1 interface.<br>
The eNodeB 103 is generally a fixed station that communicates with a UE 101,<br>
and may also be referred to as a base station (BS), a network entity or an access<br>
point. One eNodeB 103 may be deployed per cell. An interface for transmitting user<br>
traffic or control traffic may be used between eNodeBs 103.<br>
The MME provides various functions including distribution of paging messages to<br>
eNodeBs 103, security control, idle state mobility control, SAE bearer control, and<br>
ciphering and integrity protection of non-access stratum (NAS) signalling. The SAE<br>
gateway host provides assorted functions including termination of U-plane packets for<br>
paging reasons, and switching of the U-plane to support UE mobility. For clarity,<br>
MME/SAE gateway 105 will be referred to herein simply as a "gateway," but it is<br>
understood that this entity includes both an MME and an SAE gateway.<br>
A plurality of nodes may be connected between the eNodeB 103 and the gateway<br>
105 via the S1 interface. The eNodeBs 103 may be connected to each other via an<br>
X2 interface and neighbouring eNodeBs may have a meshed network structure that<br>
has the X2 interface.<br><br>
FIG. 2(a) is a block diagram depicting an architecture of a typical E-UTRAN and a<br>
typical EPC. As illustrated, eNodeB 103 may perform functions of selection for<br>
gateway 105, routing toward the gateway during a radio resource control (RRC)<br>
activation, scheduling and transmitting of paging messages, scheduling and<br>
transmitting of broadcast channel (BCCH) information, dynamic allocation of<br>
resources to UEs 101 in both uplink and downlink, configuration and provisioning of<br>
eNodeB measurements, radio bearer control, radio admission control (RAC), and<br>
connection mobility control in LTE_ACTIVE state. In the EPC, and as noted above,<br>
gateway 105 may perform functions of paging origination, LTE-IDLE state<br>
management, ciphering of the user plane, system architecture evolution (SAE) bearer<br>
control, and ciphering and integrity protection of non-access stratum (NAS) signalling.<br>
FIGS. 2(b) and 2(c) are block diagrams depicting the user-plane protocol and the<br>
control-plane protocol stack for the E-UMTS. As illustrated, the protocol layers may<br>
be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based upon<br>
the three lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) standard model that is<br>
well-known in the art of communication systems.<br>
The physical layer, the first layer (L1), provides an information transmission<br>
service to an upper layer by using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected<br>
with a medium access control (MAC) layer located at a higher level through a<br>
transport channel, and data between the MAC layer and the physical layer is<br>
transferred via the transport channel. Between different physical layers, namely,<br>
between physical layers of a transmission side and a reception side, data is<br>
transferred via the physical channel.<br>
The MAC layer of Layer 2 (L2) provides services to a radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer (which is a higher layer) via a logical channel. The RLC layer of Layer 2 (L2)<br>
supports the transmission of data with reliability. It should be noted that the RLC layer<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 2(b) and 2(c) is depicted because if the RLC functions are<br>
implemented in and performed by the MAC layer, the RLC layer itself is not required.<br>
The packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer of Layer 2 (L2) performs a<br>
header compression function that reduces unnecessary control information such that<br>
data being transmitted by employing Internet protocol (IP) packets, such as IPv4 or<br>
IPv6, can be efficiently sent over a radio (wireless) interface that has a relatively small<br><br>
bandwidth.<br>
A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane and controls logical channels, transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to the configuration, reconfiguration,<br>
and release of the radio bearers (RBs). Here, the RB signifies a service provided by<br>
the second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the E-UTRAN.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2(b), the RLC and MAC layers (terminated in an eNodeB<br>
103 on the network side) may perform functions such as scheduling, automatic repeat<br>
request (ARQ), and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). The PDCP layer<br>
(terminated in eNodeB 103 on the network side) may perform the user plane functions<br>
such as header compression, integrity protection, and ciphering.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2(c), the RLC and MAC layers (terminated in an eNodeB 103<br>
on the network side) perform the same functions as for the control plane. As<br>
illustrated, the RRC layer (terminated in an eNodeB 103 on the network side) may<br>
perform functions such as broadcasting, paging, RRC connection management, RB<br>
control, mobility functions, and UE measurement reporting and controlling. The NAS<br>
control protocol (terminated in the MME of gateway 105 on the network side) may<br>
perform functions such as an SAE bearer management, authentication, LTEJDLE<br>
mobility handling, paging origination in LTEJDLE, and security control for the<br>
signalling between the gateway and UE 101.<br>
The NAS control protocol may use three different states; first, a LTE_DETACHED<br>
state if there is no RRC entity; second, a LTEJDLE state if there is no RRC<br>
connection while storing minimal UE information; and third, an LTE_ACTIVE state if<br>
the RRC connection is established. Also, the RRC state may be divided into two<br>
different states such as a RRCJDLE and a RRC_CONNECTED.<br>
In RRCJDLE state, the UE 101 may receive broadcasts of system information<br>
and paging information while the UE 101 specifies a discontinuous reception (DRX)<br>
configured by NAS, and the UE has been allocated an identification (ID) which<br>
uniquely identifies the UE in a tracking area. Also, in RRC-IDLE state, no RRC<br>
context is stored in the eNodeB 103.<br><br>
In RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE 101 has an E-UTRAN RRC connection and<br>
a context in the E-UTRAN, such that transmitting and/or receiving data to/from the<br>
network (eNodeB) becomes possible. Also, the UE 101 can report channel quality<br>
information and feedback information to the eNodeB 103.<br>
In RRC_CONNECTED state, the E-UTRAN knows the cell to which the UE 101<br>
belongs. Therefore, the network can transmit and/or receive data to/from the UE 101,<br>
the network can control mobility (handover) of the UE 101, and the network can<br>
perform cell measurements for a neighbouring cell.<br>
In RRCJDLE mode, the UE 101 specifies the paging discontinuous reception<br>
(DRX) cycle. Specifically, the UE 101 monitors a paging signal at a specific paging<br>
occasion of every UE specific paging DRX cycle.<br>
The procedure where a UE sends a first message to a network is commonly<br>
referred to as initial access. In most systems the initial access is initiated by a UE<br>
transmitting a connection request message including the reason of the request, and<br>
receiving an answer from the network indicating the allocation of radio resources for<br>
the requested reason.<br>
In 3GPP TS 25.331 there are several reasons, referred to as establishment<br>
causes, for sending a connection request message. Establishment causes include:<br>
originating conversational/streaming/interactive/background/subscribed traffic call,<br>
terminating conversational/streaming/interactive/background call, emergency call, inter<br>
radio access technology (RAT) cell re-selection, inter-RAT cell change order,<br>
registration, detach, originating high/low priority signalling, call re-establishment and<br>
terminating high/low priority signalling.<br>
An "originating call" establishment indicates that the UE 101 wishes to setup a<br>
connection, for instance a speech connection. A "terminating call" establishment<br>
indicates that the UE 101 answers to paging. A "registration" establishment indicates<br>
that the user wants to register only to the network.<br>
To initiate access to the network a random access procedure is used. The<br>
physical random access transmission is under the control of higher layer protocol<br>
which performs some important functions related to priority and load control. These<br><br>
procedures differ in detail but GSM, UMTS and LTE radio systems have some<br>
similarities between them.<br>
In the random access procedure the UE 101 randomly selects an access<br>
resource and transmits a RACH preamble to the network. A preamble is a short<br>
signal that is sent before the transmission of the RACH connection request message.<br>
The UE 101 can repeatedly transmit the preamble by increasing the transmission<br>
power each time the preamble is sent until the network indicates the detection of the<br>
preamble. Then the message part is sent at the level of power equal to the last<br>
preamble transmission power plus an offset signalled by the network.<br>
A random access channel (RACH) is a common physical channel dedicated to<br>
the random access procedure. Uplink transmissions are generally initiated through a<br>
RACH. A UE sending data on a RACH has not yet been identified by the target eNB.<br>
RACH is typically a common uplink common channel used for transmitting control<br>
information and user data and can be sued for low data transmission from the higher<br>
layer. Such a channel is said to be contention-based since many users can attempt to<br>
access the same base station simultaneously, leading to collisions. A RACH channel<br>
can be used for several purposes. For example the RACH can be used to access the<br>
network, to request resources, to carry control information, to adjust the time offset of<br>
the uplink in order to obtain uplink synchronisation, to adjust the transmitted power,<br>
etc.<br>
A random access procedure can be launched by the UE or the eNodeB. It may,<br>
for instance, be triggered by the following events:<br>
a UE switches from power-off to power-on and needs to be registered to the<br>
network.<br>
a UE is not time-synchronized with a eNodeB and starts transmitting data (for<br>
instance the user calls).<br>
a eNodeB starts transmitting data to the UE but they are not synchronized (for<br>
instance the user receives a call).<br>
a eNodeB measures a delay of the received signal from the UE (for instance the<br>
user is moving and has lost synchronization).<br><br>
a UE is moving from one cell to another and needs to be time-synchronized with<br>
a different target eNodeB than the serving eNodeB it is registered to (handover).<br>
FIG 3 illustrates the sequences of messages and responses exchanged<br>
between a user equipment UE 101 and a base station eNB 103 in a typical RACH<br>
procedure.<br>
Firstly the UE 101 retrieves information transmitted periodically from eNB 103 on<br>
a downlink broadcast channel (BCH) and selects a preamble signature, a RACH time<br>
slot and a frequency band. The preamble signature is chosen by the UE 101 from<br>
among a set of signatures known by the eNB 103. The UE 101 generates a single<br>
random access burst containing the chosen signature and transmits it to the eNB 103<br>
over the selected time slot at the selected frequency in message 1.<br>
The random access burst consists of a cyclic prefix, a preamble, and a guard time<br>
during which nothing is transmitted as illustrated in Figure 4. CP denotes cyclic prefix,<br>
GT denotes guard time, RTD denotes round trip delay and TTI denotes transmission<br>
time interval.<br>
The preamble is sent before a RACH connection request and indicates that the<br>
UE is about to transmit data. The random access burst is transmitted during one<br>
subframe. While the UE is not synchronized in the time domain, its random access<br>
burst may overlap with the next subframe and generate interference. A guard time<br>
may thus be added to combat interference. The guard time (GT) should be at least<br>
equal to the round-trip delay at the cell edge.<br>
During the random access procedure, several users share the same channel. In<br>
order to address contention issues they are distinguishable by virtue of orthogonal<br>
sequences. These sequences are seen as the UE preamble signatures that can be<br>
transmitted simultaneously by a number of UEs. A collision occurs whenever several<br>
users choose the same signature and send it within the same time and frequency<br>
resources.<br>
The eNB 103 monitors the current RACH slot in an attempt to detect preambles<br>
transmitted from UEs in the corresponding cell.<br>
On reception of a signal the eNB 103 correlates the received signal in the RACH<br><br>
sub-frame with all possible signatures. Detection of the preamble can be either<br>
performed in the time domain or in the frequency domain. A detection variable is<br>
computed for each signature. If the detection variable exceeds a certain threshold, the<br>
preamble is considered detected.<br>
The eNB 103 sends a random access response to acknowledge the successfully<br>
detected preambles in message 2. This message is sent on a dedicated downlink<br>
channel and uses the detected signature. It contains a timing advance command, a<br>
power-control command. If the procedure Is contention-free then the UE and the<br>
eNodeB are thereby aligned in the time domain.<br>
If the UE 101 receives a response from the eNB 103 the UE 101 decodes the<br>
response and adapts its transmission timing, and its transmission power if the<br>
response contains power control information. The UE 101 then sends a resource<br>
request message - message 3 - on a dedicated uplink channel. In this message, the<br>
UE requests bandwidth and time resources to transmit data and it also indicates a UE-<br>
specific identifier. If the UE requests resources, the UE 101 uses a specific ID in the<br>
message to resolve contentions. Then the UE monitors a specified downlink channel<br>
for response from the eNB. In the case of a positive resource grant, the subsequent<br>
transmissions are carried out as normal.<br>
The eNB attempts to resolve any contentions. If the eNB 103 receives a resource<br>
request with a UE-specific ID or signature the eNB 1Q3 checks how many UEs were<br>
detected with the same signature and resolves any possible contentions. If the<br>
preamble sent by UE 101 was in collision with a preamble from another UE, the eNB<br>
103 sends a contention resolution message - message 4 - to give the command to UE<br>
101 to re-start the RACH procedure. If on the other hand the UE 101 was not in<br>
collision, the eNB sends a resource assignment message - message 5. In this case<br>
the subsequent transmissions are carried out as usual. The eNB 103 identifies the UE<br>
101 and assigns resources according to the scheduling rules applied.<br>
In the random access response, message 2, the UE may receive an ACK signal<br>
from the eNB to indicate that a message can be sent, a NACK signal indicating that<br>
the preamble was detected but a message cannot to be sent, or no response<br>
indicating that the preamble was not detected.<br><br>
In the case where UE 101 receives no response indicating that a preamble has<br>
not been detected at the first attempt, the UE 101 waits for the next RACH slot to send<br>
another preamble. The preamble signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is relatively low<br>
compared to data SNR owing to the length of the zero-correlation sequences. Given<br>
that the random access channel does not generate much interference, the UE can<br>
afford to increase the transmission power by a few decibels (dB) at the second<br>
attempt to prevent consecutive failures (power ramping method). A too long delay is<br>
not desirable, especially in the case of handovers. The UE 101 repeatedly transmits<br>
the preamble by increasing the transmission power every time the preamble is sent<br>
until the network indicates the detection of the preamble. The procedure is exited after<br>
a certain number of failures. If a preamble is successfully transmitted the message<br>
part is generally sent at the level of power equal to the last preamble transmission<br>
power plus an offset signaled by the network.<br>
One reason why a preamble may not be detected on a first attempt may be<br>
severe channel attenuation. If the next RACH slot occupies the same position in<br>
frequency domain then the channel is likely to fade again and the preamble<br>
undetected. Frequency hopping for RACH has been introduced to increase the<br>
detection performance of preamble retransmission by means of frequency diversity. A<br>
drawback of frequency hopping is that it requires more overhead in broadcast<br>
information and may introduce delay in the case of handovers.<br>
A particular drawback of frequency hopping is that it can not be performed within<br>
a 1.4MHz bandwidth since the size of the transmission bandwidth configuration<br>
(6RBs) is the same as the PRACH transmission size.<br>
A further drawback arises in the case of a handover (HO) with a 20ms RACH<br>
period. When a UE performs a HO from a serving cell to a target cell it needs to know<br>
which RACH frequency to use, A prior art solution proposes that the frequency<br>
hopping pattern is based on SFN (System Frame Number). By knowing the SFN the<br>
UE can then determine which frequency is reserved for random access. There are<br>
different possibilities for an UE to obtain the SFN of the target cell:<br>
The SFN of the target cell may be obtained through dedicated signaling (a<br>
handover command message) by the serving cell. This assumes some information<br><br>
exchange between eNBs, in order to match the SFN of the serving cell with the<br>
beginning of the frequency hopping pattern (frequency hopping period) in the target<br>
cell. Knowing the SFN an UE would be able to derive the frequency for RACH<br>
transmission in a target cell based on the SFN of serving cell from which it performs<br>
HO. This solution does not require knowing which radio frames allow RACH in the<br>
target cell in the case of a 20ms random access period. Signaling overhead and lack<br>
of SFN accuracy in unsynchronised networks are however the main drawbacks of this<br>
approach.<br>
The SFN of the target cell may be obtained by decoding the P-BCH (Physical<br>
Broadcast Channel) from the target cell. However the 40ms P-BCH TTI (Physical<br>
Broadcast Channel transmission time interval) can lead to unacceptable HO<br>
interruption time.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an alternative method of<br>
increasing the probability of detection of a RACH preamble and to thereby improve the<br>
RACH procedure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a network<br>
entity for processing a random access preamble, the network entity comprising: a<br>
transceiver for receiving an random access preamble; and a processor for determining<br>
if the random access preamble is successfully detected, and for determining, in the<br>
case where the random access preamble is not successfully detected, if a combined<br>
preamble resulting from a combination of the random access preamble with a previous<br>
random access preamble received at the network entity prior to reception of the<br>
random access preamble and having an identical signature to the signature of the<br>
random access preamble, is successfully detected.<br>
By combining the received preamble energy of a current RACH preamble with a<br>
previously received RACH preamble having the same preamble signature, the<br>
probability of RACH preamble detection is increased without the need to change the<br>
frequency at each RACH transmission. Combining the preambles in this way improves<br>
RACH performances because the addition leads to constructive interference of the<br>
noise samples while the signal samples are added. The signal to noise ratio is<br><br>
therefore higher. Moreover, the procedure simplifies a HO procedure since there is no<br>
need to read the SFN in order to determine at which frequency a preamble should be<br>
transmitted<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a user<br>
equipment for transmitting a random access preamble to a network entity, the user<br>
equipment comprising: a transceiver for transmitting a random access preamble; and<br>
a processor for determining if the random access preamble is successfully detected at<br>
the network entity, the processor being operable to allocate a signature to a<br>
retransmission random access preamble in the case where the random access<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a RACH initial access<br>
procedure between a UE and a network entity constituted of an eNodeB and in<br>
particular to the procedure of detection of a preamble signal at the eNodeB.<br>
The functional modules of a RACH preamble detection receiver of a base station<br>
eNodeB 103 according to a first embodiment of the invention are illustrated in Figure<br>
5A. The RACH preamble detection receiver 10 comprises a demodulation module 11,<br>
a cyclic prefix removal module 12, a DFT (discrete Fourier Transform) processing<br>
module 13, a demapping module 14, a RACH correlation module 15, an IDFT (Inverse<br>
Discrete Fourier Transform) processing module 16, an adder 17, a memory 18 and a<br>
detection module 19.<br>
Figure 5B illustrates a random access procedure in LTE according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A random access procedure between a user<br>
equipment UE 101 and a base station eNodeB 103 is initiated by UE 101 after UE 101<br>
has received transmission information transmitted periodically from eNodeB 103 on a<br>
downlink broadcast channel. Such information includes available preamble signatures<br>
in the cell, frequency location and period of available RACH slots, target power etc. In<br>
step S101 UE 101 sets its transmission power according to the signal attenuation<br>
measured in the downlink channel. Open-loop power control can be used to obtain a<br>
suitable transmission power. The UE 101 estimates path loss from a downlink<br>
reference signal and sets the transmission power to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR) target indicated by the eNB 103. The eNB 103 may fix the targeted SNR upon<br><br>
the measured level of interference in the uplink channel. The shadowing in the uplink<br>
path may differ from the shadowing in the downlink path because the carrier frequency<br>
has changed.<br>
In step S101 UE 101 selects a preamble signature - preamble signature A, a<br>
RACH time slot and a frequency band. The preamble signature is chosen by the UE<br>
101 from among a set of signatures known by the eNodeB 103. Preamble signatures<br>
should portray good autocorrelation properties in order for the eNodeB 103 to obtain<br>
an accurate timing estimation for a single preamble; and good cross correlation<br>
properties in order for the eNodeB 103 to obtain an accurate timing estimation for<br>
different preambles transmitted simultaneously by different UEs.<br>
In 3GPP LTE, RAN1 Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences may be used to fulfil these<br>
requirements. These sequences are seen as UE signatures. Each cell possesses a<br>
set of signatures obtained from Zadoff-Chu sequences. For example a cell may have<br>
64 preamble sequences with the length of one sequence being generally A/=839<br>
samples. A ZC sequence is defined by two integers: u is the root index and v is the<br>
cyclic shift index.<br>
In the time domain, the v -th cyclic shift is extracted from the u-th root with the<br>
expression:<br>
  where Ncs is the cyclic shift length.<br>
The u-th root sequence in the frequency domain is given by:<br><br>
The ZC sequences can be used because they are able to generate a large<br>
number of sequences and they offer interesting correlation properties: the<br>
autocorrelation function shows no side peaks. The cross correlation between two<br>
sequences obtained from different roots is given by Thus ZC sequences have<br>
zero-cross-correlation zones.<br>
UE 101 transmits to the eNodeB 103 a random access burst including the<br>
preamble signal containing preamble signature A over the selected time slot at the<br><br>
selected frequency.<br>
On reception of the random access burst from the UE 101, in step S102 the<br>
random access burst is demodulated in demodulation module 11. The cyclic prefix<br>
(CP) is removed from the received random access burst signal by CP removal module<br>
12. In step S103 the preamble signal then undergoes a discrete Fourier transform<br>
(DFT) in the frequency domain and a demapping process.<br>
In step S104, the correlation module 15 of eNode B 103 correlates the received<br>
preamble signal with all the possible signatures in step S104. The time domain RACH<br>
correlation sequence is then obtained from the frequency domain RACH spectrum<br>
correlation output through IDFT processing in IDFT processing module 16.<br>
It will be appreciated, that in embodiments of the invention, detection may be<br>
performed in the time domain or in the frequency domain<br>
In the first embodiment of the invention as illustrated in FIG 5B, prior to detection,<br>
in step S105, the preamble signal is added to a preamble signal stored in a memory<br>
18 having the same preamble signature A. In step S106 the power level of the<br>
received preamble signal is compared with a successful detection threshold in<br>
detection module 19 as illustrated in Fig 6. If the power level of the preamble signal<br>
exceeds a successful detection threshold, Threshold B, then it is considered that the<br>
preamble signal is successfully detected and the memory 18 containing the combined<br>
preamble signal is flushed in step S107. The eNodeB 103 proceeds according to the<br>
conventional RACH procedure. In step S108 a timing offset can be computed from the<br>
peak position of the preamble signal as illustrated in Figure 6 and a power adjustment<br>
can be estimated from the values of the detection values. The eNodeB 103 then<br>
sends an acknowledgement random access response to the UE 101 in step S109<br>
using the detected preamble signature A indicating timing advance and any power<br>
adjustment.<br>
If, however, in step S106 the power level of the preamble signal does not exceed<br>
the successful detection threshold level but exceeds a lower combining acceptance<br>
threshold level, Threshold A, the contents of the memory 18 are retrieved in step S110.<br>
If the memory contains a combined preamble signal of the unsuccessfully detected<br>
preamble signal and a previous unsuccessfully detected preamble signal having the<br><br>
same preamble signature and received in a previous RACH slot, then the power level<br>
of the combined preamble signal is compared with the successful detection level. If<br>
the power level of the combined preamble signal exceeds the successful detection<br>
level the memory 18 is flushed in step S107 and the eNodeB 103 proceeds according<br>
to the conventional RACH procedure. In step S108 a timing offset can be computed<br>
from the peak position of the preamble signal and a power adjustment can be<br>
estimated from the values of the detection values. The eNodeB 103 then sends an<br>
acknowledgement random access response to the UE 101 in step S109 using the<br>
detected preamble signature A indicating timing advance and power adjustment.<br>
If the user equipment UE 101 does not receive a response from the eNodeB 103<br>
the UE 101 generates a second random access burst signal and allocates the same<br>
preamble signature - preamble signature A as the previous unsuccessfully detected<br>
first Random access burst signal to the second random access burst signal. The<br>
second preamble random access burst signal is transmitted to the eNB 103 at an<br>
increased power level in step S101.<br>
On reception of the second preamble access burst signal at the eNodeB 103 the<br>
second random access burst signal undergoes steps S102 to S104 of demodulation,<br>
CP removal, DFT processing, demapping, correlation and IDFT processing. In step<br>
S105 the second preamble signal is then added to the first preamble signal in the<br>
memory 18 since the first preamble signal and the second preamble signal have the<br>
same preamble signature - preamble signature A. In step S106 the power level of the<br>
second preamble signal is compared with the successful detection threshold level. If<br>
the power level of the second preamble signal exceeds the successful detection<br>
threshold level then the memory 18 is flushed in step S107 and the eNB 103 sends an<br>
ACK signal to the UE 101 in step S109.<br>
If the power level of the second preamble signal does not reach the successful<br>
detection level but does exceed the combining detection threshold level then the<br>
combined preamble signal of the first preamble signal and the second preamble signal<br>
having the same preamble signature - signature A is retrieved from memory 18 and<br>
the power level of the combined preamble signal is compared with the successful<br>
detection level in step S106. If the power level of the combined preamble signal<br>
exceeds the successful detection threshold level then the memory 18 is flushed in<br><br>
step 107 and the eNB 103 sends an ACK random access response signal to the UE<br>
101 in step 109.<br>
If detection of the combined signal is unsuccessful the eNB 103 sends no<br>
response to the UE101 and monitors for further incoming RACH burst signals. A<br>
preamble signal having a particular signature can be added to preamble signals in the<br>
memory having the sample particular signature up to a predetermined total number of<br>
signals. The memory 18 can be flushed of a combined preamble signal having a<br>
particular signature after a predetermined number of successive preamble signals<br>
having that particular signature have been received and unsuccessfully detected.<br>
Alternatively the memory can be flushed of a combined or initial preamble signal<br>
having a particular signature after a predetermined time period following unsuccessful<br>
detection of the first preamble signal having that particular signature.<br>
In the flow chart of FIG. 5A, for illustrative purposes, count X is used to ensure the<br>
same combined signal is not retrieved more than once for successful threshold<br>
comparison. If X exceeds 1, the detection module awaits a new preamble signal to be<br>
added to the memory before retrieving a combined signal and X is reset to 0. Count Y<br>
corresponds to the number of successive preamble signals having a particular<br>
signature that have been received and unsuccessfully detected. Each time a<br>
preamble signal is added to a preamble signal or a combined preamble signal having<br>
the same signature in the memory, Y is incremented. Y is reset when it exceeds<br>
threshold K and the memory is flushed. It will be appreciated that alternative suitable<br>
counting or timing methods may be used.<br>
Since in a conventional RACH procedure collision detection does not occur until<br>
after message 4 of Figure 3, keeping the same signature for retransmitted preambles<br>
from UE 101 does not increase the probability of collision. If earlier contention<br>
resolution is implemented, a NACK random access response can be sent in the<br>
random access response of step S109 from eNode 103, i.e. in message 2 of Figure 3<br>
to indicate collision with another UE. On receiving such a NACK response from<br>
eNodeB103, the UE 101 will change the preamble signature to a different signature in<br>
order to avoid collision and send a preamble having the different signature to the<br>
eNodeB103.<br><br>
A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 7A and 7B. In the<br>
second embodiment of the invention, a preamble signal transmitted by UE 101 in step<br>
S201 identical to step S101 of the first embodiment, undergoes, on reception at<br>
eNodeB 103, steps S202 to S204 of demodulation, CP removal, DFT processing,<br>
demapping, correlation and IDFT processing, identical to steps S102 to S104 of the<br>
first embodiment. The second embodiment differs to the first embodiment of the<br>
invention in that the power level of the received preamble signal is compared with a<br>
successful detection level in step S206 prior to being added to the contents of memory<br>
28. If the power level of the received preamble signal falls below the successful<br>
threshold level and exceeds the combining threshold level, the preamble signal then<br>
added to the memory contents in step S210a. The preamble signal is added to one or<br>
more stored preamble signals having the same signature as the received preamble<br>
signal to form a combined signal. In step S210b the combined preamble signal is<br>
retrieved from the memory 28 and compared with the successful detection threshold<br>
level. The method then proceeds in a similar manner to the first embodiment.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 8A and 8B. In the third<br>
embodiment of the invention a preamble signal transmitted by UE 101 in step S301<br>
identical to step S101 of the first embodiment, undergoes steps S302 and S303 of<br>
demodulation, CP removal, DFT processing, and demapping, identical to steps S102<br>
and S103 of the first embodiment, on reception at eNodeB 103. The third embodiment<br>
of the invention differs to the first embodiment of the invention in that the preamble<br>
signals are added to the contents of the memory 38 in step S304 prior to signature<br>
correlation and IDFT processing in step S305. If the received preamble signal is<br>
unsuccessfully detected, i.e. falls below the successful detection threshold level, in<br>
step S306 a combined preamble signal constituted of one or more preamble signals<br>
having the same preamble signature undergoes the steps of signature correlation and<br>
IDFT processing in step S305 before being compared with the successful detection<br>
threshold level in S306. The method then proceeds in a similar manner to the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, preamble signals may be individually<br>
stored in a memory and then combined with one or more preamble signals having the<br>
same signature after an unsuccessful detection occurs.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the methods of the invention may be used as an<br>
alternative to frequency hopping as a method of increasing the probability of preamble<br>
detection, or in combination with frequency hopping to increase the probability of<br>
preamble detection and improve RACH performance.<br>
While embodiments of the present invention has been hereinbefore described in<br>
relation to the illustrative case of a 3GPP LTE system, those skilled in the wireless<br>
communication art will appreciate that the invention is applicable to communications<br>
systems other than 3GPP LTE systems.<br>
Many further modifications and variations will suggest themselves to those versed<br>
in the art upon making reference to the foregoing illustrative embodiments, which are<br>
given by way of example only and which are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention, that being determined solely by the appended claims.<br><br>
