Novel diphenylazetidinones, process for their preparation, medicaments comprising these compounds and their use<br>
The invention relates to substituted diphenylazetidinones, to their physiologically acceptable salts and to derivatives having physiological function.<br>
Diphenylazetidinones (such as, for example, ezetimibe) and their use for treating hyperiipidemia and arteriosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have already been described [cf. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(7):679-685 and US 5,756,470].<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide further compounds having a therapeutically utilizable hypolipidemic action. In particular, it was an object to find novel compounds which, compared to the compounds described in the prior art, are absorbed to a very low extent. Very low absorption is to be understood as meaning an intestinal absorption of less than 10%, preferably less than or equal to 5%.<br>
In particular, absorption of the novel compounds must be less than that of ezetimibe. Pharmaceutically active compounds which are absorbed to a very low extent generally have considerably fewer side-effects.<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to compounds of the formula I,<br><br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6	independently of one another are (C0-C30)-<br>
alkylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -CH=CH-, -C=C-, -N((d-C6)-alkyl)-, -N(( C1C6)-alkylpenyl) or -NH-;<br>
H, F,  C1, Br, I, CF3, N02, CN, COOH, COO( C1C6)-alkyl, CONH2, CONH( C1C6)-alkyl, CON[( C1C6)-alkyl]2, ( C1C6)-alkyl, (C2-C6)-alkenyl, (C2-C6)-alkynyl, 0-( C1-C6)-alkyl, where one, more or all hydrogens in the alkyl radicals may be replaced by fluorine;<br>
S02-NH2, S02NH( C1-C6)-alkyl, S02N[( C1C6)-alkyl]2, S-( C1C6)-alkyl, S-(CH2)n-phenyl, SO-( C1C6)-alkyl, SO-(CH2)n-phenyl, S02-( C1C6)-alkyl, S02-(CH2)n-phenyl, where n = 0 - 6 and the phenyl radical may be substituted up to two times by F,  C1, Br, OH, CF3, N02, CN, OCF3, 0-( C1C6)-alkyl, ( C1C6)-alkyl, NH2;<br>
NH2, NH-( C1C6)-alkyl, N((C1-C6)-alkyl)2, NH( C1C7)-acyl, phenyl, 0-(CH2)n-phenyl, where n = 0 - 6, where the phenyl ring may be mono-to trisubstituted by F,  C1, Br, I, OH, CF3, N02, CN, OCF3, 0-( C1-C6)-alkyl, ( C1C6)-alkyl, NH2, NH( C1C6)-alkyl, N(( C1C6)-alkyl)2, S02-CH3, COOH, COO-( C1C6)-alkyl, CONH2;<br><br>
(LAG)	is a sugar residue, disugar residue, trisugar residue, tetrasugar residue;<br>
a sugar a C1d, an amino sugar;<br>
an amino a C1d residue, an oligopeptide residue comprising 2 to 9 amino a C1ds; a trialkylammoniumalkyl radical; -0-(S02)-OH;<br>
where in each case at least one of the radicals R1 or R6 must have the meaning (Co-C30)-alkylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -CH=CH-, -C=C-, -N((d-C6)-alkyl)-, -N(( C1C6)-alkylpenyl) or -NH-, and where the radicals R1 and R2 may not have the meaning -O-sugar residue or -O-sugar a C1d, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Preference is given to compounds of the formula I, in which at least one of the radicals R1 to R6 has the meaning (Co-C3o)-alkylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -N(( C1C6)-alkyl)-,or-NH-.<br>
Particular preference is given to compounds of the formula I, in which one of the radicals R1 or R3 has the meaning (Co-C3o)-alkylene-(LAG), where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radicals may be replaced by -0-, -(C=0)-, -N(CH3)-, or -NH-.<br>
Very particular preference is given to compounds of the formula I, in which one of the radicals R1 or R3 has the meaning -(CH2)o.i-NH-(C=0)o.r(C0"C25)-alkylene-(C=0)0-i-N(R7)o-i-(LAG); where one or more carbon atoms of the alkylene radical may be replaced by oxygen atoms and where R7 is H or CH3.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to compounds of the formula I in which the group LAG is a monosugar residue.<br>
A trialkylammonium alkyl radical is to be understood as meaning the following group<br><br><br>
in which n = 0 to 10 and Alk1, Alk2, Alk3 independently of one another each denote a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Owing to their in C1eased solubility in water, compared to the parent compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceuticallyacceptable a C1d addition salts of the compounds according to the invention are salts of inorganic a C1ds, such as hydrochloric a C1d, hydrobromic a C1d, phosphoric a C1d, metaphosphoric a C1d, nitric a C1d, sulfonic a C1d and sulfuric a C1d, and of organic a C1ds, such as acetic a C1d, benzenesulfonic a C1d, benzoic a C1d,  C1tric a C1d, ethanesulfonic a C1d, fumaric a C1d, gluconic a C1d, glycolic a C1d, isothionic a C1d, lactic a C1d, lactobionic a C1d, maleic a C1d, malic a C1d, methanesulfonic a C1d, suc C1nic a C1d, p-toluenesulfonic a C1d, tartaric a C1d and trifluoroacetic a C1d, for example. For medical purposes, very particular preference is given to using the chloride salt Suitable pharmaceuticallyacceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and cal C1um salts).<br>
The scope of the invention also includes salts having a pharmaceuticallyunacceptable anion, which salts may be useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
Here, the term "derivative having physiological function" refers to any physiologically acceptable derivative of a compound according to the invention, for example an<br><br>
ester, capable of forming, upon administration to a mammal, for example man, to form such a compound or an active metabolite (directly or indirectly).<br>
A further aspect of this invention are prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may or may not be active in their own right.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be present in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. The scope of the invention includes all polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention, which form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Hereinbelow, all references to "compound(s) of formula (I)" refer to a compound or compounds of the formula (I) as described above, and to their salts, solvates and derivatives having physiological function, as described herein.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts and derivatives having physiological function are ideal medicaments for treating an impaired lipid metabolism, in particular hyperlipidemia. The compounds of the formula I are also suitable for modulating the serum cholesterol concentration and for preventing and treating arteriosclerotic manifestations.<br>
The compound(s) of the formula (I) can also be administered in combination with other active compounds.<br>
The amount of a compound of the formula (I) required to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example on the specific compound chosen, on the intended use, on the mode of administration and on the<br><br><br>
salts, the abovementioned weight data relate to the weight of the diphenyl-azetidinone-ion derived from the salt. For the prophylaxis or therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used themselves as the compound, but preferably they are present in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and is not harmful to the health of the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as an individual dose, for example as a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Further pharmaceuticallyactive substances can also be present, including further compounds of the formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist in mixing the constituents with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or auxiliaries.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral or peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration, although the most suitable manner of administration is dependent in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the type of the compound of the formula (I) used in each case. Coated formulations and coated delayed-release formulations are also included in the scope of the invention. A C1d-resistant and enteric formulations are preferred. Suitable enteric coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of metha C1ylic a C1d and methylmetha C1ylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can be present in separate units, such as, for example, capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets, which in each case contain a spe C1fic amount of the compound of the formula (I); as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. As already mentioned, these compositions can be prepared according to any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which can<br><br>
consist of one or more additional constituents) are brought into contact. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product, if necessary, is shaped. For example, a tablet can thus be prepared by pressing or shaping a powder or granules of the compound, if appropriate with one or more additional constituents. Pressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, if appropriate mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or a (number of) surface-active/ dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be produced by shaping the pulverulent compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges which contain a compound of the formula (I) with a flavoring, customarily su C1ose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which include the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or su C1ose and gum arabic.<br>
Suitable other active compounds for the combination preparations are: all antidiabetics, mentioned in Rote Liste 2001, Chapter 12. They can be combined with the compounds of the formula I according to the invention in particular to achieve a synergistically enhanced action. The active compound combination can be administered either by separate administration of the active compounds to the patient or in the form of combination preparations comprising a plurality of active compounds in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Antidiabetics include insulin and insulin derivatives, such as, for example, Lantus® or HMR 1964, GLP-1 derivatives, such as, for example, those disclosed by Novo Nordisk A/S in WO 98/08871, and oral hypoglycemic active compounds.<br>

The amino a C1d pGlu denotes pyroglutamyl, Nal denotes 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, azagly-NH2 denotes a compound of the formula NH2-NH-CONH2 and D-Asp denotes the D form of aspartic a C1d. According to their chemical<br><br>
nature, peptides are a C1d amides, and on hydrolysis they decompose into amino a C1ds.<br>
An oligopeptide is to be understood as meaning a peptide constructed of 2 to 9 of the amino a C1ds mentioned above.<br>
Suitable protective groups (see, for example, T.W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis") for amino a C1ds are primarily:<br>
Arg(Tos), Arg(Mts), Arg(Mtr), Arg(PMV), Asp(OBzl), Asp(OBut), Cys(4-MeBzl), Cys(Acm), Cys(SBut), Glu(Obzl), Glu(Obut), His(Tos), His(Fmoc), His(Dnp), His(Trt), Lys( C1-Z), Lys(Boc), Met(O), Ser(Bzl), Ser(But), Thr(Bzl), Thr(But), Trp(Mts), Trp(CHO), Tyr(Br-Z), Tyr(Bzl) or Tyr(But).<br>
Amino protective groups that are preferably used are the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) radical, which can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation, the 2-(3,5-dimethyloxyphenyl)propyl(2)oxycarbonyl(Ddz) or trityl (Trt) radical, which can be removed by weak a C1ds, and the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) radical, which can be removed using secondary amines.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing diphenylazetidinone derivatives of formula I.<br><br><br>
-(CH2)x-NH2 may alternatively also be attached to one of the other two phenyl rings.<br>
The process for preparing the compounds of the formula I comprises reacting an amine of the formula II with an alkylating or acylating agent which, preferably in the omega position, carries a further functionality - if appropriate in protected form. This functionality is (after deprotection) used for attaching (LAG), for example with the formation of ether, amine or amide bonds.<br>
The examples below serve to illustrate the invention in more detail, without limiting the invention to the products and embodiments des C1ibed in the examples.<br>

Using the method des C1ibed below, the activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention was examined:<br><br>
Effect on cholesterol absorption + 3H-taurocholic a C1d ex C1etion using fecal ex C1ement of mice, rats or hamsters<br>
NMRI mice, Wistar rats, or Golden Syrian hamsters (in groups of n=4-6) are kept in metabolic cages, where they are fed with a standard diet (Altromin, Lage (Lippe)). The afternoon prior to the administration of the radioactive tracers (14C-cholesterol), the feed is removed and the animals are adapted to grates.<br>
Additionally, the animals are labeled s.c. with 3H-TCA (taurocholic a C1d) (for example 1 p C1/mouse up to 5 p C1/rat) 24 hours prior to the peroral administration of the test meal (14C-cholesterol in lntraliµld®20, Pharma C1a-Upjohn).<br>
Cholesterol absorption test: 0.25 ml/mouse Intraliµld ® 20 (Pharma C1a-Upjohn) ((sµlked with 0.25 p C1 of 14C-cholesterol in 0.1 mg of cholesterol) is administered perorally by gavage.<br>
Test substances are prepared separately in 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma)/5% Solutol (BASF, Ludwigshafen) or a suitable vehicle. The administration volume of the test substance is 0.5 ml/mouse. The test substance is administered immediately prior to the test meal (Intraliµld labeled with 14C-cholesterol) (cholesterol absorption test).<br>
The feces are collected over a period of 24 h: fecal elimination of 14C-cholesterol and 3H-taurocholic a C1d (TCA) is determined after 24 hours.<br>
The livers are removed and homogenized, and aliquots are in C1nerated in an oximate (Model 307, Packard) to determine the amount of 14C-cholesterol which had been taken up/absorbed.<br><br>
Evaluation:<br>
Feces samples:<br>
The total weight is determined, the sample is made up with water to a defined volume and then homogenized, and an aliquot is evaporated to dryness and in C1nerated in an oximate (Model 307 from Packard for the in C1neration of radioactively labeled samples): the amount of radioactive 3H-H20 and 14C-C02 is extrapolated to the amount of 3H-taurocholic a C1d and 14C-cholesterolf respectively, that is ex C1eted (dual isotope technique). The ED200 values as dose from a dose-effect curve are interpolated as those doses at which the ex C1etion of TCA or cholesterol is doubled, based on a control group treated at the same time.<br>
Liver samples:<br>
The amount of 14C-cholesterol taken up by the liver is based on the administered<br>
dose. The ED50 values are interpolated from a dose-effect curve as the dose at<br>
which the uptake of 14C-cholesterol by the liver is halved (50%), based on a control<br>
group.<br>
The ED50 values below demonstrate the activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention<br>
Example No.	EDgn (liver) Img/mousel<br>
II	0.1<br>
III	0.003 XIII	0.3 XV	0.01 XVIII	1.0<br><br>
XX	0.03<br>
XXI	1.0<br><br>
XXIV	0.3<br>
XXV	0.3 XXX                                                0.1<br><br>
As can be seen from the table, the compounds of the formula I have very good cholesterol-lowering action.<br>
Bioabsorption:<br>
The bioabsorption of the compounds of the formula I was examined using the Caco cell model (A.R. Hilgers et al., Caco-2 cell monolayers as a model for drug transport a C1oss the intestinal mucosa, Pharm. Res. 1990, 7, 902).<br>
From the measured data, it can be seen that the bioabsorption of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention is considerably lower than that of compounds des C1ibed in the prior art (reference structure):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br><br>
R2, R3, R4, R5, R6        independently of one another are	H, F;<br>
R7	is H,CH3;<br>
(LAG)	is a sugar residue;<br>
