The invention is based on an apparatus for producing tubular bag packs in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. An apparatus of this type has been disclosed, for example, by German Offenlegungsschrift 15 86 029. The known apparatus has two sealing-jaw pairs and two clamping-jaw pairs each with separate drive, the sealing-jaw pairs being arranged above the clamping-jaw pairs. Due to the separate drives for the clamping-jaw pairs and the sealing-jaw pairs, the construction of the known apparatus involves a relatively high degree of outlay and a large amount of space is required for the apparatus. It is also known, from US 5, 369, 941, to arrange sealing-jaw pairs on common carriers. Clamping-jaw pairs, however, are not provided. It is additionally known, from DE 39 05 605 Al, to use a tubular bag machine having a single flexible-tube-forming device with a sealing-jaw pair and a clamping-jaw pair, which can be moved independently of said sealing-jaw pair.<br>
The object of the invention is to simplify the construction of an apparatus for producing tubular bag packs of the generic type and, at the same time, to render the space required by this apparatus as small as possible. This object is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1. Further advantages and advantageous developments of the novel apparatus for producing tubular bag packs can be taken from the subclaims and the description.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for forming, filling and closing tubular bag packs, having two devices, which are aligned in parallel with one another and are intended for forming in each case one flexible tube from in each case one packaging-material web, and having two transverse-seam-sealing devices, which subdivide into tubular bag packs the flexible tubes each provided at the front end with a filling, and which has clamping-jaw pairs, which can be moved towards one another and in each case one movable sealing-jaw pair, characterized in that the clamping jaws and sealing jaws are<br><br>
actuated by linear drives, in that each sealing-jaw pair is arranged in an interspace between the clamping-jaw pairs, in that each of the transverse-seam-sealing devices has in each case one sealing-jaw pair, which can be actuated independently of the other sealing device, in that the sealing planes of the transverse-seam-sealing devices run in parallel at a distance from one another, and in that those clamping jaws which are moved in the same direction in each case, said clamping jaws belonging to the two sealing devices, and have a common drive.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is described in more detail in the following description. Figure 1 shows a vastly simplified front view of a duplex tubular bag machine and Figure 2 shows a plan view of the transverse-seam-sealing means of the duplex tubular bag machine according to Figure 1, some parts beins illustrated as beina partially broken away in the figures.<br><br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
Two flexible-tube-forming devices 11, 12 are arranged one beside the other, and in each case one heat-sealable packaging-material strip 1, 2 is formed, around in each case one forming tube 13, 14, in the flexible tube 3, 4 by said devices 11, 12. The mutually overlap¬ping edges of the packaging-material strips 1, 2 are connected by longitudinal-seam-sealing devices 15, 16 to give longitudinal seams 5. Arranged beneath the flexible-tube-forming devices 11, 12 is a transverse-seam-sealing means 20 with two sealing units 21, 22 which divide off the two flexible tubes 3, 4, seal them transversely and sever them, tubular bag packs 6 being formed in the . process. The tubular bag packs 6, with the bottom end closed, have each already had a certain filling intro¬duced into them by way of the respective forming tube 13, 14. The transverse-seam-sealing means 20 is moved up and down in order to advance the flexible tubes 3, 4 cycli¬cally. However, it is also possible for the transverse-seam-sealing means 20 to be arranged in a stationary manner if the flexible tubes 3, 4 are advanced by advan¬cement devices known per se.<br>
Each sealing unit 21, 22 of the transverse-seam-sealing means 20 has a sealing-jaw pair with in each case two sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 which can be moved towards one another and are arranged in an interspace between two clamping-jaw pairs 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 in each case. With the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 drawn back, a severing cutter 37, 137 can be introduced into the interspace.<br>
In their initial position, the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 and the clamping jaws 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 of the individual pairs have been drawn apart from one another, with the result that that end of the flexible tubes 3, 4 which is provided with a filling can be guided therebetween. In order to produce the transfer seams 7 or the top and bottom seams, the clamping jaws 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 are first of all advanced towards one another and pressed<br><br>
together, with the result that in each case one tubular bag pack 6 is divided off from the flexible tubes 3, 4. Shortly after this, the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 of the individual pairs are also closed, with the result that transverse seams 7 are formed on the flexible tubes 3, 4 under the action of pressure and heat. After the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 have been retracted, a severing cutter 37 and 137 moves into the interspace between the clamping jaws 33, 35 and 133, 135 and cuts through the respective transverse seam 7 along its length, this resulting in a top seam being formed on the tubular bag pack 6 which has just been made and a bottom seam being formed on the new flexible-tube end. After , this, the severing cutters 37, 137 and the clamping jaws 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 are drawn back into the initial position again. As long as the clamping-jaw pairs 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 clamp the flexible tube 3, 4 securely, the transverse-seam-sealing means 20 is moved downwards by the length of one bag, in which case the flexible tubes 3, 4 are advanced. After the clamping jaws have been opened, the transverse-seam-sealing means 20 returns to the upper position, and a new operating cycle can commence.<br>
The sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132, the clamp¬ing jaws 33, 34; 35, 36 and 133, 134; 135, 136 and the severing cutters 3 7 and 137 are arranged on a carrier 23 which is in the shape of a rectangular frame comprising in each case two parallel bars 24, 25 and crossmembers 26, 27, from which forks 28, 2 9 project inwards in a mirror-inverted manner. By means of an adaptor 30, the carrier 23 is connected to a vertical lifting and guiding means (not illustrated in any more detail) for the carrier 23.<br>
The two sealing units 21, 22, which are designed in the same way, are arranged in the carrier 23 in a mirror-inverted manner with respect to a plane which is located centrally between the crossmembers 26, 27, the two sealing planes running at a distance from one another and in parallel with the mirror plane. The two inner<br><br>
sealing jaws 32, 132 are fastened on two rod pairs 41, 141 which can be displaced longitudinally in bearing eyelets 42, 142 of the forks 28, 29 and in the crossmem-bers 26, 27. The outer ends of the rods 41, 141 are firmly connected to one another in each case by means of a yoke 43, 143 against which the piston rods 44, 45 and 144, 145 of in each case two hydraulic cylinders 46, 47 and 146, 147, seated in the crossmembers 26, 27, press. The two outer sealing jaws 31, 131 have guide bores 48, 148 at their ends, by means of which guide bores they can be displaced on the rods 41. The piston rod 49 of in each case one hydraulic cylinder 50, 150, seated in the crossmembers 26, 27, presses against the outer sealing , jaws 31, 131 in the direction opposite to that in which the hydraulic cylinders 46, 47 and 146, 147 push. The individual sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 of each sealing unit 21, 22 are moved apart into the rest posi¬tion in each case by two helical-spring pairs 51, 52 and 151, 152, the individual springs of which are firmly connected to the crossmembers 26, 27 by one end and have a tensioning action. The other end of the helical springs of the helical-spring pairs 51, 151 is fitted on angle pieces 53, 153, which are fastened on the yokes 43, 143. Similarly, the second ends of the springs of the helical-spring pairs 52, 152 are seated on retaining means 54, 154, which are firmly connected to the ends of the outer sealing jaws 31, 131. In the operating position, with the hydraulic cylinders 46, 47, 50 and 146, 147, 150 actu¬ated, the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132 of the two sealing units 21, 22 are pressed against one another in each case (Figure 2). When the actuation of the hydraulic cylinders 46, 47, 50 and 146, 147, 150 ceases, said sealing jaws are drawn apart from one another into the rest position by the helical-spring pairs 52, 53 and 152, 153, this resulting in a wide gap being formed between them so that a flexible-tube end can be guided there¬between.<br>
The clamping jaws 33, 35; 34, 36 and 133, 135; 134, 136, which in each case delimit a single sealing jaw<br><br>
31, 32 and 131, 132 at the top and bottom, are firmly connected to one another laterally and are mounted on two parallel guide rods 61, 62, anchored in the crossmembers 26, 27, such that they can be displaced in parallel with the sealing jaws, 31, 32 and 131, 132. In contrast to the sealing jaws 31, 32 and 131, 132, each of which has its own drive, those clamping jaws which are moved in the same direction in each case 33, 35 and 134, 136; 133, 135 and 34, 36 are driven together. For this purpose, the ends of the respectively outer clamping jaws 33, 35 and 133, 135 are firmly connected to the piston rod 63, 64 and 163, 164 of in each case two pneumatic cylinders 65, 66 and 165, 166, which are fastened in pairs in the crossmembers 26, 27 and in each case actuate the outer clamping jaws 33, 35 and 133, 135 of each sealing unit 21, 22 directly. The ends of the inner clamping jaws 34, 36 and 134, 136 are firmly connected to the ends of the outer clamping jaws 33, 35 and 133, 135 by means of connecting rods 67, 68, with the result that the inner clamping jaws 34, 36 and 134, 136 of one sealing unit 21 or 22, respectively, are actuated via the clamping jaws 133, 135 and 33, 35 of the other sealing unit.<br>
It should additionally be pointed out that, in modification of the abovedescribed exemplary embodiment, it is, of course, also possible to provide an independent drive in each case for the clamping-jaw pairs 33, 34, 35, 36 assigned to the flexible-tube-forming device 11 and for the clamping-jaw pairs 133, 134, 135, 136 assigned to the flexible-tube-forming device 12. This means that the respective clamping-jaw pairs 33 to 36 and 133 to 136 are not positively coupled by means of the abovedescribed connecting rods 67, 68. Rather, the respectively oppositely arranged clamping jaws of each clamping-jaw pair 33, 34; 35, 36; 133, 134; 135, 136 are coupled, for example, by means of a chain drive or by means of toothed racks such that, in the event of a clamping jaw which is positively coupled to a pneumatic cylinder moving, the mating jaw assigned to the clamping-jaw pair is moved towards, or away from, said first-mentioned clamping jaw.<br><br>
The abovedescribed modification of the apparatus makes it possible to control the movement of the clamping-jaw pairs 33 to 36 independently of the movement of the clamping-jaw pairs 133 to 136.<br><br><br>
