				<td>Encapsulated Barrier for Flexible Films<br>
And a Mitood of Making the Same<br>
The present invention relates to an encapsulated banter film structure and a<br>
method of malting the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to a<br>
thermoplastic, multilayer packing film having a barrier layer consisting of a<br>
thermally sensitive polymer material, preferably ethylene vinyl alcohol. The<br>
material acts to prevent the passage of gases such as, for example, oxygen and/or<br>
water vapor, from one side of the film to the other. The barrier material is<br>
encapsulated by one or more layers of a relatively thermacy stable material that acts<br>
to protect the barrier material from high temperatures and/or long residence times<br>
present during coextrusion, lamination or coating mat may destroy or otherwise<br>
degrade the barrier material. The one or more thermally stable encapsulsting layers<br>
and in bindmg the thermally sensitive barrier layer to outer layers having relatively<br>
higher melt and/or extrusion temperatures thereby maintaining optical clarity of the<br>
film produced therefrom, In addition, the present invention relates to using an acid<br>
terpolymer as an adhesive to bind the thermally sensitive barrier cose material to<br>
high temperature outer layers white eliminating clarity problems associated with<br>
using other adhesives.<br>
It is, of course, generally known to utilize a polymeric material as % barrier<br>
material in films to prevent the passage of molecules such as, for example, gases<br>
and water vapor. Films may have these barrier properties to protect foods or other<br>
gas-sensitive materials that may be contained within bags or other containers made<br>
from the films. In particular, food articles are subject to the deleterious effects of<br>
gases and water vapors.<br>
A known film structure that prevents the passage of molecules therethrough<br>
uses polyvinylidene chloride ("PVdC) or polyvinylidene chloride/methyl acrylate<br>
copolymer ("PVdC/MA"), commonly known as MA-Saran and manufactured by<br>
Dow Chemical Company. These barriers are generally useful in preventing<br>
molecules suck as oxygen from patting therethrough but are fastly unstable at the<br>
high temperatures needed to produce many multilayer films from a moltes, resin.<br>
Typically, FVdC degxades at high temperatures forming polyenes reducing the<br>
optical clarity of films made therefrom. A suitable, albeit more costly, substitute<br>
for MA-Saran is emylene vinyl alcohol coporymer ("EVOH").<br>
Another film that ia commonly used as a barrier layer, especially for food<br>
products such aa cheese, is a PVdC coated oriented polypropylene ("OPP") layer.<br>
Structures made using this barrier material have good barrier characteristics.<br>
Specifically, barrier layers of FVdC coated OFF adequately restrict the movement<br>
of oxygen molecules or water vapor through packaging made therefrom. However,<br>
PVdC coaled OPP is coat prohibitive.<br>
Generally, EVOH ia thermally stable at higher temperatures relative to<br>
PVdC or MA-Saran. However, EVOH is still sensitive to high temperature,<br>
particularly when adhered to a layer of polyethylene ("PE") having maleic<br>
anhydride functional groups. While EVOH may be extruded at higher temperatures<br>
relative to PVdC, the temperature of extrusion may still be too low for coextrusion<br>
win other layers mat require very high temperatures for adequate melting and/or<br>
adhesion to lamination or coating substrates.<br>
Typical methods of coextrusion generally entail feeding the barrier material<br>
and adhesive resins into a feedblock where they are arranged into an "A/B/A"<br>
configuration prior to extrusion through a die. The adhesive layers most be<br>
compatible with me barrier layer as well as me substrates that are being laminated<br>
or coated. Further, the adhesive layers most be at or greater man 600°F to<br>
adequately adhere to the substrace. However, this adhesive layer melt temperature<br>
requites mat the downstream hardware (such as, for example, the feedblock and/or<br>
the die) be at or greater man 600°P as well. Many barrier materiala, including,<br>
especially, EVOH, ready degrade when exposed to tomperatures greater than about<br>
450oF for extended periods of time. Dae to mis degradation, as well as me<br>
extensive reaction mat may occur between the barrier material and the adhesive<br>
layer at the layer interface, the ratting extrudate may have clarity or other<br>
problems. For example, BVOH reacts wife boiled amhydride, a typical adhesive<br>
layer wed with BVOH, to produce a "ground glass" appearance when coextraded at<br>
high temperatures for extended periods of time.<br>
A known process of coextruding and laminating heat sensitive materials is<br>
described fat U.S. Patent Nor 5,106,562, 5,108,844, 5,190,711 and 5,236,642,<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Various methods are<br>
disclosed fot reducing the impact of higher temperature polymeric meltstream<br>
elements on a lower temperature polymeric meltstream. The methods may include<br>
super-cooling the hotter meltstream element below me melting temperature hot<br>
above the crystallization (empertture, exposing one or more moltstream elements to<br>
an another thermal condition for a limited period of time, and/or using one or<br>
more layers as a heat sink via encapsulation.<br>
Specifically, these patents describe methods of encapsulating one film layer<br>
by another material. The "562 and "844 patents specifically relate to FVdC or,<br>
preferably, PVdC-MA core materials with othylene vinyl acetate copolymer<br>
("EVA") or emylene methyl acrylete copolymer ("EMA") or blend"s thereof<br>
encapsulating me core material The encapsulated PVdC or PVdC-MA is,<br>
therefore, protected from the high temperature of the coextrusion process.<br>
Generally, the encapsulation memod uses am encapsalator having a crosshead<br>
mandrel with a central bore to receive a first mettstream element from an extruder.<br>
A second polymeric meltstream is fed through a sleeve via an inlet passage into me<br>
oncapsalator. As me second meltsteam enters the encapsulator, it splits and flows<br>
around me first meltstream. Consequently, the second meltstream completely<br>
surrounds me first meltstream, thereby forming a combined meltsteam. The<br>
second meltstream forms a contimuous layer about the circumference of the first<br>
meltstream completely surounding me first mettstream. Thus, me first and second<br>
ineltstreams maintain their individual identities while me first meltstream is<br>
completely surrounded by and encapsulated within the second meltsteam. The<br>
combined meltstream may men be fed through a transport pipe to a feedblock for<br>
coextrusion with one or more other layers to produce a meltilayer film. However,<br>
these patents do not disclose other material that may be utilized as heat sensitive<br>
barrier materials besides PVdC or PVdC-MA<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to encapsulating a barrier material with a flat<br>
adhesive layer at the same melt temperature as the barrier material. For example,<br>
EVOH melts at less than 450°F and, therefore, is encapsulated by the first adhesive<br>
layer at less than 450oF prior to entering the feedblock. The eacapsulating first<br>
adhesive layer protects the barrier material from the hot melt temperatures of a.<br>
second adhesive layer, which the first adhesive material encounters within the<br>
feedblock. The first adhesive material insulates the barrier material from the month<br>
higher melt temperature of the second adhesive layer. Moreover, the first adhesive<br>
material directically reduces the residence time of the barrier material within the<br>
hardware by keeping it away from areas of high drag and hangup, such as the<br>
internal walls of the hardware. The result is an extradite with excellent clarity.<br>
It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide a film<br>
structure and a method of manufacturing me same mat use a relatively inexpensive<br>
barrier material to prevent the nalgration of gases through the film structnre such as,<br>
for example, oxygen and/or water vapor, without degrading due to high heat and/or<br>
long residence times within the film producing equipment. The encapsulated EVOH<br>
barrier layer may be utilized effectively as. a replacement to oost-prohibitive barrier<br>
materials such, as PVdC coated OPP.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a film structure and<br>
a method of manufacturing the same that allow the use of a thermally sensitive<br>
barrier material to be utilized within high temperature coextrusion/lamination<br>
process.<br>
And, an advantage of me present invention is to provide a fihn structure and<br>
a method of manufacturing the same mat surround the thermally sensitive barrier<br>
material with an adhesive in an encapsulating process to protect the barrier material<br>
from high temperature that may exist in the coextrusion/lamination process.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is to provide a film structure<br>
and a method of manufacturing the same that use an adhesive to encapsulate the<br>
barrier material at the melt temperature of the barrier material. Further, the adhesive<br>
layer may protect the barrier material from layers coextruded therewith or laminated<br>
thereto having higher melt temperatures. In addition, the adhesive may protect the<br>
barrier material from high temperatures of the hardware and long residence times<br>
within the hardware.<br>
Moreover, an advantage of the present invention is to provide a film structure<br>
and a method of manufacturing the same that uses a thermally sensitive material<br>
such as EVOH as the barrier layer material to reduce costs of the film structure.<br>
And, another advantage of the present invention is to provide a film structure<br>
and a method of manufacturing the same that eliminates interlayer leakage and<br>
deadspots in the barrier layer material flow patterns.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in,<br>
and will be apparent from, the detailed description of the presently preferred<br>
embodiments and from the drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an improved-coextrusion lamination process having a<br>
plurality of extruders and encapsulators in an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2A shows a film structure having a barrier layer encapsulated by first<br>
adhesive layers which, in turn, are encapsulated by second adhesive layers, and then<br>
laminated outer substrates in an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2B illustrates a film structure having a barrier layer encapsulated by<br>
first adhesive layers and coextruded with second and third adhesive layers. Further,<br>
outer substrate layers are then laminated thereto.<br>
Figure 2C illustrates an alternate embodiment of the present invention of a<br>
barrier layer encapsulated by first adhesive layers and coextruded with a single<br>
second adhesive layer on only one side of the barrier layer/first adhesive layer<br>
encapsulation. Further, outer substrate layers are then laminated thereto.<br>
Detailed Description of the Presently Preferred Embodiment<br>
The protect invention relates to a film structure and a method of<br>
manufacturing the film structure. Mote specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
a structure having a banter layer to protect against the migration of molcules such<br>
at, for example, gates and/or water vapors. Generally, a first adhesive layer at a<br>
relatively low melt temperature encapsulates a thermally sensitive barrier layer.<br>
Other adhesive layers are extraded at high temperatures relative to the barrier layer<br>
and encapsulate or otherwise are coextruded with the first adhesive tayer and the<br>
barrier layer. The high temperature of the second adhesive layers aid in adhering<br>
the other adhesive layers so outer substrate layers. The first adhesive layers may<br>
thereby act as both a heat sink to protect the barrier layer from the high<br>
temperature of the coextrusion/lamination process and a the layer to aid in bonding<br>
the thermally sensitive harder layer to the outer substrate tayers. Moreover, the<br>
present invention, relates to an improved adhesive layer comprising an acid<br>
terpolymer for EVOH that may be used in any high temperature coextrusion<br>
process.<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts,<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an encapsulation system 1. The encapsulation system 1 may<br>
include an extruder 3 mat may melt and extrude a barrier material 2 into a<br>
meltstream 4 using means well known in the art. The barrier material 2 may be<br>
melted and extruded at a relatively low temperature so mat the barrier material 2<br>
does not degrade within the extruder 3. An adhesive material 10 may be extruded<br>
in a second extruder 9 to form in adhesive meltstream 8. The adhesive material 10<br>
may be melted and extruded at a temperature that is the same or relatively similar to<br>
the melt temperature of the barrier material 2. The meltstream 4 may then be fed<br>
into an encapsulator 6 and encapsulated by the adhesive material 10 via methods<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,106.562, 5,108.844. 3,190,711 and 3,236.642,<br>
each of which is incorporated in these entirety by reference. By encapsulating the<br>
thermally sensitive barrier material 2 (meltstream 4) by the adhesive material<br>
(meltstream 8), the barrier material 2 may be protected from high temperatures<br>
present within the system 1. Further, the adhesive material 10 (meltstream 8) may<br>
aid in reducing the residence time of the barrier material 2 within the downstream<br>
coextrusion hardware. The residence time is reduced because me encapsulating<br>
adhesive material 10 increases the laminar from of the barrier material 2 through the<br>
hardware. In other words, the barrier material 2 will not get held up on the surfaces<br>
of the downstream hardware since the barrier material 2 will not contact me surfaces<br>
of the hardware.<br>
An encapsulated meltstream 12 is thereby produced that may then fed into<br>
a feedblock 14. The feedblock 14 may be a Clorren feedblock, or any other<br>
feedblock apparent to those skilled in the art. At this point, a number of different<br>
options are available to create a number of different structures. First, the<br>
encapsulated meltstream 12 may be encapsulated by a meltstream 16 from a second<br>
adhesive material 18 that is method and extruded in a third extender 15. Partial<br>
cancapsulation may occur if the encapsulating material does not completely surround<br>
the encapsulated material. Second, the meltstream 16 and a meltstraeam 17 from<br>
a third adhesive material 20 mat is melted and extruded in a fourth extruder 19, may<br>
be coextruded with the encapsulated meltstream 12 within the feedblock 14. A<br>
multylayer-coextruded sheet 22 may be formed after passing the meltstream through<br>
a die 21 to thin and spread the material into the flat sheet 22. After the sheet 22 is<br>
produced, it may be laminated with outer layers such as various substrates detailed<br>
below with reference to Figures 2A-2C.<br>
Figure 2A shows an improved structure 100 that may be produced by the<br>
system described above with reference to Figure 1. The structure 100 may include<br>
a barrier layer 110 mat may be completely encapsulated by first adhesive layers<br>
112. The barrier layer 110 may be composed of any thermoplastic polymeric<br>
material mat may prevent me migration of molecoles sach as, for example, oxygen<br>
and water vapor, thereby protecting sensitive materials contained within packages<br>
made from the structure 100. For example, the structure 100 may be utilized as a<br>
bag mat may be sealed on all sides and may completely surround an article of food<br>
contained therein. The barrier layer 110 may preferably be made from a material<br>
having superior barrier properties such as, for example, polymers and/or<br>
copolymers of HVOH and EVOH blends of nylon or polyethylene. Moreover, other<br>
materials may include polyamide polymers, copolymers and blends thereof; PVdC<br>
and PVdC-MA; acrylonitrile polymers and copolymers; and polyethylene<br>
copolymers and/or blends.<br>
The barrier layer 110 may be protected by the first adhesive layer 112 that<br>
may encapsulate the barrier layer 110 via the system described in Figure 1. The<br>
first adhesive layers 112 may be coextruded to encapsulate the barrier layer 110 to<br>
create a first encapsulated extrudate 113 composed of a barrier layer 110 completely<br>
surrounded by first adhesive layers 112. The first extrudate 113 may then be<br>
coemtruded with and/or encapsulated by second adhesive layers 114 at a higher<br>
temperature than the first encapsulated extrudate 113. The first adhesive layers 112<br>
may product the barrier layer 110 from the high temperatures necessary to<br>
adequstely melt and extrude the second adhesive layers 114 or any other layer<br>
coextruded, laminated or otherwise disposed adjacent to the first adhesive layers<br>
112.<br>
Outer layers 116, 118, and/or 120 may be laminated to the first extrudate 113<br>
as apparent to those skilled in the art. The owner layers 116,118 and/or 120 may<br>
include any substrate necessary to add desired properties to the structure 100. For<br>
example, the outer layer 116 may include any material that may add strength,<br>
stiffness, heat resistance, durability and/or printability to the structure 100. Further,<br>
the layer 116 may act to prevent the migration of certain types of molecules, such<br>
as, for example, modulate, from penetrating into the inner layer of the structure<br>
100. Further, the layer 116 may add flex crack resistance to the film structure<br>
produced. In addition, the outer layer 120 may be composed of a material that may<br>
act as s sealant when heated. However, it ahoald be noted mat the outer layers<br>
116,118 and/or 120 may be composed of any material apparent to those skilled in<br>
the act for providing desired characteristics to the structure 100.<br>
Alternatively, the first extradate 113 may be coextruded with one or more<br>
layers as shown with reference to Figures 2B and 2C, rather than be encapsulated<br>
with the adhesive layers 114. Referring now to Figure 2B, the first extrudate 113<br>
may be coextruded with an adhesive layer 130 on a surface of the first extrudate<br>
113. Another adhesive layer 132 may be coextrnded on an opposite surface of the<br>
first extradate 113. The adhesive layer 130,132 may be the same notarial or,<br>
alternatively, may be composed of different materials. The adhesive layers 130,132<br>
may be different depending on the type of material bonded thereto to from the<br>
outside layers 116, 118 and/or 120. However, any type of layer may be laminated<br>
thereon as may be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Further, the first extradate 113, including the barrier layer 110 and the first<br>
adhesive layers 112, may have an adhesive layer 134 coextruded on only one<br>
surface of the first extrudate 113 as shown in Figure 2C. In addition, there may be<br>
no adhesive layer disposed on the opposite surface of me tost extradase 113.<br>
Further, the outer layers 116,118 may be laminated to the adhesive layer 134.<br>
Conventional adhesive layers coextnided, laminated or otherwiae disposed<br>
adjacent to an EVOH barrier layer typically are compoaed of a ream of polyethylene<br>
haying maleic anhydride grafted thereon. However, as stated previously, maleic<br>
anhydride tends to react with the EVOH copylyner chain causing crosslinkages<br>
between the maleic enhydride grafted polyethylene and the EVOH. Many<br>
crosspackages may degrade me qnalny of the barrier layer properties and may<br>
father degrade the optical clarity of the film, causing a wavy "ground glass"<br>
appearance.<br>
Therefore, other material may be utilized in the present invention as<br>
adhesive layers to encapsulate, coextrude with, laminate to or otherwise be disposed<br>
adjacent to the EVOH barrier material. For example, it has been determined that an<br>
acid terpolymer of, prederably, ethylese, acrylic acid and methyl acrylate works<br>
well to tie the barrier layer of EVOH to outer layers of the film structure while<br>
protecting the EVOH barrier layer from Ugh temperatures and long residence times<br>
within the coextrusion hardware. Moreover, acid terpolymer may be used as an<br>
adhesive layer for the following barrier layers: EVOH; EVOH/nylon blends;<br>
EVOH/polyethylene ("PE") copolymers; polyaamides and acrylonitrile. Although<br>
acid terpolymer may not bind well with EVOH, this invention allows the EVOH and<br>
acid terpolymer to be subject to long residence times in order to adequentely adhere<br>
to each other.<br>
Further, polyamide, otherwise known as nylon, also may adequestely bond<br>
BVOH to outer substrate layers. Polyamide adhesive layers may adhere to the<br>
following barrier layers at relatively low melt temperatures: EVOH, EVOH/nylon<br>
blends, EVOH/PE copolymers and polyamide. Moreover, acid terpolymers and<br>
nylon may provide good adhesiom to EVOH without causing the optical clarity<br>
problems associated with maleic adhydride.<br>
It should also be noted that white acid terpolymer and nylon may be used<br>
wife encapsulation, at described above, they should not be limited in that regard.<br>
Specifically, acid terpolymer and nylon adhesive layers adhering to EVOH may be<br>
used in any film-making process apparent to those skilled in the art, including<br>
coextrusion and lamination processes.<br>
Moreover, although maleic anhydride grafted to PB may canae clarity<br>
problems when used as an adnealve with EVOH, maleic anhydride may still be<br>
used, especially when clarity it not an issue. Polyethylene grafted with maleic<br>
anhydride fractional groups may bond to the following barrier layers: EVOH,<br>
EVOH/nylon blends, EVOH/PE copolymers, polymides and PVdC-MA.<br>
Oner adhesive layers that may be utilized to bond to the barrier layer and to<br>
the barrier layers to outer layers may include a polystyrene block copolymer,<br>
preferably for bonding to an acrylonitrile barrier layer. In addition, ethylene acrytic<br>
add copoiymer ("BAA") may be need to bond to PVdC-MA or an acrylonitrile<br>
barrier layer.<br>
The adhesive layers 114, 130, 132 and/or 134 as shown in Figaros 2A-2C<br>
may aid in bonding me adhesive layen 112 to substrates mat may be disposed on<br>
outside surfaces of me film structure. Generally, the adhesive layers 114,130,132<br>
and/or 134 may be meted and/or coextruded at relatively high temperatures since<br>
the adheaive layen 112 protect the barrier layer 110. The fact that EVOH is<br>
protected by the adheaive layers 112 allows me use of high temperature to<br>
adequentely adhere the adhesive layers 114, 130, 132 and/or 134 to the outer<br>
substrate layers.<br>
The adhesive layers 114, 130, 132 and/or 134 may comprise any of the<br>
following: acid terpolymer; maleic antydride grafted to polyethylene; EMA; EVA;<br>
or polystyrene block copolymer. Further, EMA may be used to the adhesive<br>
layers 112 to the following outer layers: oriented polyesters; oriented<br>
polypropylene; oriented nylon, metal foil; paper and paper board. further, EVA<br>
may be used as the adhesive layers 114, 130, 132 and/or 134 to bond the adhesive<br>
layers 112 to oriented polyesters, metal foil, uniaxially oriented polypropylene or<br>
high density polyethylene ("HDPE"), paper and paper board. Finally, polyethylene<br>
such as low density polyethylene ("LDPE"), linear low density polyethylene<br>
("LLDPE"), medium density polyethylene ("MDPE") and HDPE may be med as<br>
the adhesive layers 114, 130, 132 and/or 134 to the adhesive layers 112 to many<br>
other types of layers except biaxially oriented polypropylene, uniaxially oriented<br>
polypropylene or HDPE.<br>
The barrier layer 110, adhesive layers 112, 114, 130, 132 tad/or 134 may<br>
be laminated to substrates to form completed film structures. As noted with<br>
reference to Figures 2A and 2B, the substrates may include the owner layers 116,<br>
118 and/or 120. The substrates may be composed of any of the following materials;<br>
oroented polyesters and variations thereof including metalized polyesters; oriented<br>
polypropylene and variations thereof including matalized PP; biaxcially oriented<br>
nylon; metal foil; unusually oriented PP or HDPE; paper and paper board; non-<br>
oriented nylon or EVOH/nylon blends, including metallized variations thereof;<br>
extrusion coated PET/nylon; single site catalyzed ("SSC") polyolefins and<br>
iosomers. It should be noted that the list of substrates above is not exhaustive; any<br>
polymeric material may be need as a substrate for any purpose as may be apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art. The following table lists common substrates with<br>
materials commonly used as adhesives. Further, the table lists the melt<br>
temperatures necessary to adequetely adhere the adhesive materials to the substrates:<br>
As shown in Structure 1 and corresponding to the film structure shown in<br>
Figure 2A or 2B, EVOH or an EVOH blend (&gt;75% BVOH) may be used as the<br>
barrier layer 110 with acid terpolymer or maleic anhydride grafted to PE as the<br>
adhesive layers 112 encapasulating fee EVOH barrier layer 110. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the EVOH barrier layer may be encapsulated by add terpolymer<br>
forming the first extnidate 113 at a first temperature that is relatively low since both<br>
the EVOH and acid terpolymer will extrude within the same temperature range of<br>
400° F and 450° F, preferably 410° F. Next, PB copolymers or blends thereof<br>
may be coextruded with the first extrudate 113 of EVOH and acid terpolymer or<br>
maleic anhydride to make a film, structure corresponding to the film structure of<br>
Figure 2B. Alternatively, the first extradate 113 may be fed through a second<br>
encapsulator thereby encapsulating the first extrudate by the PE copolymer such as,<br>
for example, EMA, thereby making a film structure corresponding to me film<br>
structure of Figure 2A.<br>
Preferably, the adhesive layers 114, 130 are EMA. To adequately adhere<br>
the EMA to me oriented polypropylene layer, as shown in Structure 1, me EMA<br>
should be extruded at a temperature of about 550° F. Moreover, the adhesive<br>
layers 114, 132 bonded to the outer layer 120 of PET should be extruded at a<br>
temperature of about 610° F to adequately adhere to the PET. As previously noted,<br>
the adhesive layers 112 protect the EVOH barrier layer from the high temperatures<br>
or long residence times of the encapsulation or coextrusion of the adhesive layers<br>
114,130 and/or 132.<br>
As shown in Structure 2 and corresponding to the Him structure shown in<br>
Figure 2A or 2B, EVOH or an EVOH Mend (&gt;75% EVOH) may be used as the<br>
barrier layer 110 with nylon as the adhesive layers 112 encapsulating the EVOH<br>
barrier layer 110. The EVOH barrier layer may be extruded within a temperature<br>
range of 400o F and 450° F, preferably 410° F and may be encapsulated by nylon<br>
that may be extruded within the temperature range of 440° F and 470° F, preferably<br>
450° F. Next, the adhesive layers 114,130 and/or 132 comprising a layer of LDPE<br>
or EMA may encapsulate or otherwise be coextruded with the first extradate 113 of<br>
EVOH and nylon to make a film structure corresponding to the film structure of<br>
Figure 2A or 2B. To adequately adhere the LDPE or EMA to the oriented<br>
polypropylene layer, as shown in Structure 2, the LDPE or EMA should be<br>
extracted at temperature of about 550° F. Moreover, the adhesive layers 114,132<br>
comprising LDPE or EMA bonded to the outer layer 120 of PET should be extruded<br>
at a tenperatnre of about 610° F to adequately adhere to the PET. As previously<br>
noted, the adhesive layers 112 protect the EVOH barrier layer from the high<br>
temperatures or long residence times of the encapsulation or coextration of the<br>
adhesive layers 114,130 and/of 132.<br>
Structure 3 may correspond to the fin structure of Figure 2B, except<br>
without the outer layer 116. In other words, Structure 3 may nave a barrier layer<br>
110 of EVOH encapsulated by the adhesive layers 112 comprising, preferably, acid<br>
terpolymer. Again, the EVOH and the acid terpolymer may be extruded between<br>
400° F and 450° F. Adhesive layer 114, 130 and/or 132 may encapsulate or<br>
otherwise be coextruded with the first extrudate 113 comprising EVOH and acid<br>
terpolymer. The adhesive layers 114, 130 bonding to outer layer 118 comprising<br>
EVA may be extruded at a temperature between 580° F and 620o F. The adhesive<br>
layers 114,132 that bond to the outer layer 120 comprising PET may be extruded at<br>
a temperature of about 610° F. The elimination of the OPP layers allows for the<br>
use of LDPE as the adhesive layer 114 or 130.<br>
Structure 4 illustrates another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the barrier layer 110 may be EVOH or EVOH blended with<br>
nylon, having adhesive 112 couprising nylon encapsulating the barrier layer 110.<br>
Again, the barrier layer 110 and the first adhesive layer 112 my be extruded and<br>
encapsulated at roughly the same temperature to protect the barrier layer from<br>
degradation caused by baat or long residence times. Further, the adhesive layers<br>
114, 130 and/or 132 may comprise polyethylene blended with polyethylene having<br>
maleic anhydride functional groups grafted thereto and may encapsulate the barrier<br>
layer and the first adhesive layers or may otherwise be coemtraded therewith. The<br>
adhesive layers 114, 130 and/or 132 may be extruded at a relatively high<br>
temperature compared to the barrier layer and the adhesive layers 112: about 580° F<br>
to about 620o F. The outer layer 116 may comprise an oriented polypropylene<br>
layer or a layer of nylon disposed between the adhesive layer 114 or 130 and the<br>
outer layer 118 may comprise a sealant layer of EVA or other material. Further,<br>
the outer layer 120 may be PET or biaxially oriented nylon. Another embodiment<br>
may have no outer layer 116 disposed between me adhesive 114 or 130 and the<br>
outer layer 118.<br>
It should be understood that various changes and modification to the<br>
presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its attendant<br>
