Background and prior art references<br>
About 40 species of berberis belonging to family Barbaridancae are reported, all of which are mentioned as used medicinally. Reference may be made to the book Tndina Medicinal Plants' by Krtikar and Basu, vol. I. Second Edn. 1993, Periodical Experts Book Agency, D-42, Vivek Vihar, Delhi-110032, wherein it is said that all seem to have similar therapeutically properties. Among many species of berberis growing wiled in the Himalayan subs topical belt at altitudes ranging from 1000-2200 m, the most commonly reported ones are B. lyceum, B. asiatica, B. arristata, B. chitria, B. osmastonii, B. insignis, B. vulgaris, B. wallichiana, B. coriaria, B. floribunda, B. himalica, B. jaeschkeana, B. lambertii, B. tinctoria, B. virescens, B. nepalensis, B. Petionolaris and B. umbellate. Reference may be made to the book 'Glosasry of Indian Medicinal Plants'by R.N. Chopra, S.L. Nayar and I.C. Chopra, CSIR, New Delhi, India, 1956, p36 and 'The Wealth of India, Raw Material, vol.2: B, 1998, pi 14-115, wherein species names and descriptions are given.<br>
The plant is very hardy and grows in all types of soils and terrain in Himlayan sub-tropical belt. During summer months (June - July), the plant bears heavy fruit in the form of clusters of berries, which ripen, into lively red-violet fruits in the month of August. The ripe berries find scant attention except that some are eaten by local young and birds, otherwise the produce of the plant goes waste.<br><br>
The place Palampur in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh amidst majestic<br>
Dhauladhar ranges of Himalayan ecosystem is a natural habitat of Berber is lycium,<br>
locally known as 'Kasmal1 and it's fruits as 'Kasmalu'. Reference may be made to<br>
"Some Useful Wild Plants of Himachal Pradesh by Dr. O.P. Sharma, HPKV,<br>

The plant is valued mainly for it's roots which are a rich source of alkaloid berberine<br>
and other related alkaloids that find application in eye diseases, as a febrifuge, in<br>
chronic diarrhoea and piles and an extract made from it's roots is locally known as<br>
'Rasaunt' and used in opthalmia. Umbellatine, major alkaloid found in B. lycium root,<br>
is more effective than berberine. Reference may be made to the book 'Glossary of<br>
Indian Medicinal Plants by R.N. Chopra, S.L. Nayar and I.C. Chopra. CSIR, New<br>
Delhi, India, 1956, p36 Wherein these properties are mentioned. In Indo China, the<br>
fruit of the plant is given as a tonic in kidney troubles. Reference may be made to the<br>
book 'Indian Medicinal Plants by Kirtikar and Basu, vol. I. Second Edn. 1993,<br>
Periodical Experts Book Agency. D-42, Vivek Vihar, Delhi-110032, p. 104. The fruits<br>
are used in the traditional medicine, as a tonic for liver and heart and have selective<br>
inotropic activity. Reference may be made to 'Possible mechanism of selective<br>

The plant is a deciduous tree of small and medium size. It is very hardy and grows in<br>
all types of soils and terrain in the temperate Himalayas and is said to reproduce from<br>
root suckers with great freedom. The tree is favoured as a rootstock for common pear<br>
(P. communis) and also for the apple. There are two forms of this species: one bearing<br>
small fruits and the other, larger ones. The fruits remain hard with a firm whitish<br>
astringent flesh until November or December when the flesh begins to ripen and is<br>
edible. They may be gathered, dried and stored for later use when they are ground and<br>
mixed with the flours of either wheat (Triticum aestivum), mandua or ragi (Eleusine<br>
coracana). Ripe fruits contain total solids 25.1%; protein 1.8% and ascorbic acid<br>
3.2mg/100g. As the fruits ripen, the starch is converted into sugars and at full<br>
maturity, these contain 3.3% of sugars. The wood is used for walking sticks, combs,<br>
tobacco pipes, textile mill bobbins and as fuel. Bark contains friedelin (0.5%) and 6-<br>
sitosterol. Leaves contain n-hentriacontane (1%), myricyl alcohol and 6-stosterol.<br>

The making and brewing of wines from frui.s is an ancient art as old as the human<br>
civilisation. However, the wine industries around the world are based on<br>
commercially grown fruits, mostly grapes and apples and rarely on wild edible fruits<br>
which endow greater food attributes in terms of chemical constituents and other health<br>
values. Yeast culture for making wines are also maintained on fruit juices mostly on<br>
orange juice. Reference may be made to 'New Scientist', 2 September 1989, p38-43<br>
and the book 'Wine Science. Principles and Applications', 1994, by Jackson-RS.<br>
