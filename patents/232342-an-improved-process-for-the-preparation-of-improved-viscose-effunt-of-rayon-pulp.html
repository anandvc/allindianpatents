				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of improved viscose effluent of rayon pulp having reduced amount of total dissolved solids (IDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and coloring matter . This invention particularly relates to a process for reduction of total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and coloring matter from viscose effluent of ryon pulp waste.<br>
According to literature the COD, TDS and color of viscose solution may be attributed to the presence of lignin, hemicellulose, xanthate, resin, wax, fat and acids like propionic, acetic etc. and other coloring substances from the raw material like Eucalyptus, Jute and Bamboo used for making pulp. The presence of above mentioned materials can affect pulp properties of rayon.<br>
The quality of the pulp plays a very important role in the manufacture of viscose. Certain specifications such as lower percentage of alpha cellulose and higher percentage of lignin, makes the viscose deep in color, which characteristically affect rayon grade fibers. Lignin may be defined as an amorphous polyphenolic material arising from an enzyme-mediated dehydrogenative polymerization ' of three phenylpropanoid monomers, of coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohols. Lignin (from the Latin, wood) is after cellulose, the principal constituent of woody structure of higher plants which in part is deposited in xylem cell walls, and in part located in intercellular spaces. Lignin is not easily biodegradable and the presence of it influences the viscose process in the following ways:<br>
1.	It reduces the reactivity of cellulose, including it's swelling and solubility properties.<br>
If the amount of lignin is more in the bulk, the solubility of xanthate will be less<br>
resulting in poor filterability of viscose.<br>
2.	It hinders the aging of alkali cellulose.<br><br>
3.	It increases the hardness of the fiber.<br>
4.	The amount of lignin present in it decides the deepness of the color of viscose<br>
effluent.<br>
During xanthation process side products such as trithiocarbonate and sodium carbonate<br>
are formed according to the following equation :<br>
3CS2 + 6NaOH-» 2Na2CS3 + Na2CO3 + 3H2O<br>
The formation of the side products are not desired as they increase the TDS of viscose<br>
and affects stability of viscose and also harmful gases are evolved from thiocarbonate<br>
during spinning. Almost 20-30% CS2 is consumed in the formation of thiocarbonate,<br>
which indirectly affects the xanthate ester formation.<br>
Until past two three decades or so large amount of colored effluents containing lignin and<br>
other organics imparting high COD, TDS and color were discarded into natural stream<br>
and waterways as dilute aqueous solutions, which is not tolerated now.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines a number of primary and<br>
secondary treatment systems are installed. The treatment systems comprise clarifiers to<br>
»<br>
remove 85 wt.% of suspended solids, aerated lagoons, trickling filters, modified biological systems to remove most of the solids and toxicity with reduction of BOD and COD but very little removal of color and TDS. Ultrafiltration has also been tried and found futile to remove TDS as well as color completely.<br>
In the prior art the following methods are used to remove COD, TDS and color of viscose solution in rayon industry. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief herein below:<br><br>
