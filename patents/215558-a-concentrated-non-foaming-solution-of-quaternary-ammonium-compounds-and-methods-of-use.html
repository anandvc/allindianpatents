				<td>1. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates" to a solution comprising a concentrated amount<br>
of an antimicrobial quaternary ammonium compound (QAC). The QAC concentrate of the<br>
present invention utilizes GRAS (generally recognized as safe) components to form a true<br>
solution, not an emulsion, of the QAC. This QAC concentrate solution is prepared in<br>
combination with at least one solubility enhancing agent and is useful in preparing solutions<br>
for dilution to a final concentration that are useful in industrial food processing or in the<br>
home in food preparation and on surfaces associated with food processing.<br>
The present invention relates generally to a solution comprising a<br>
concentrated amount of an antimicrobial QAC and at least one solubility enhancing agent<br>
that is suitable for use in methods of preventing the growth of a broad range of<br>
microorganisms on and in food products, as well as on surfaces that come in contact with<br>
food products in the home or in an industrial environment. More specifically, the present<br>
invention relates to a solution comprising a concentrated amount of an antimicrobial QAC<br>
and at least one solubility enhancing agent that is suitable for use in a method for<br>
preventing the growth of a broad spectrum of microorganisms on and in food products; by<br>
contacting such food products, as meat products, for example, poultry, beef, pork, lamb,<br>
venison, and other edible meat products; seafood, for example, fish and shellfish; fruit,<br>
vegetables, dairy products, pet foods or snacks, such as those prepared from animal meat,<br>
skin and parts, that may include pig"s ears, rawhide and jerky; and any other food products<br>
that can be treated utilizing the aqueous treatment methods of the present invention without<br>
detrimentally affecting the appearance, texture, and quality of the food. More specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to a solution comprising a concentrated amount of an<br>
antimicrobial QAC that is suitable for use in a method to inhibit the attachment of, to<br>
remove, and/or to prevent the growth of microorganisms on food products. Particularly,<br>
the use of the solution comprising a concentrated amount of an antimicrobial QAC relates<br>
to the effect of QACs on microorganisms that can cause foodborne contamination. More<br>
particularly, these microorganisms include microorganisms from the genus Staphylococcus,<br>
Streptococcus, Campylobacter, Arcobacter, Listeria, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Salmonella,<br>
non-toxin-producing Escherichia, pathogenic toxin-producing Escherichia, such as<br>
O157:H7. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved treatment<br>
method of applying diluted QACs on food products, by any means, but preferably includes<br>
spraying or misting diluted QACs on the food products to prevent broad spectrum microbial<br>
growth on these products, where the application time of the QAC can be as short as at least<br>
one tenth of a second. This short application time of the dilute QAC is particularly useful<br>
in a commercial or industrial setting.<br>
2. Description of the prior art<br>
Prevention of foodborne illnesses by microbial contamination is of major<br>
concern to the food processing industry, regulatory agencies, and consumers. A recent<br>
report from the Food Safety &amp; Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department<br>
of Agriculture (Federal Register, February 3, 1995) estimates that over 2 million cases of<br>
foodborne illnesses are produced annually by microbial contamination in the United States,<br>
with an associated cost of over $1 billion. Foodborne microbial contamination occurs both<br>
prior to entry into the processing facility, and by cross-contamination in the processing<br>
environment. The FSIS has instituted new Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point<br>
(HACCP) requirements to reduce the occurrence and number of foodborne pathogens.<br>
These regulations must be met by food processors. Although the means of achieving this<br>
microbial reduction is left to the discretion of the processor, FSIS expects that antimicrobial<br>
treatments will be an important component of HACCP plans. The treatment methods of the<br>
present invention, which employ aqueous formulations prepared from solutions of<br>
concentrated QACs, are useful in meeting the HACCP requirements.<br>
In their efforts to provide a product completely free of microbial<br>
contamination, poultry and meat processors have encountered major difficulties in<br>
removing microorganisms that adhere or attach vigorously to poultry and meat tissues<br>
intended as food products. If contaminating microorganisms do not attach to the surface of<br>
the food, they can be easily rinsed off. However, the microorganisms that become strongly<br>
attached cannot be removed by rinsing and are quite resistant to removal by chemical or<br>
physical means.<br>
Several chemical and physical methods have been proposed to reduce<br>
microorganisms in meat products, such as the use of chlorine or chlorine dioxide, ozone,<br>
hydrogen peroxide, lactic acid, sodium carbonate, trisodium phosphate, and electrical<br>
stimulation. Generally, these methods have shown limited effectiveness in reducing<br>
microbial contamination and may affect the physical appearance of the meat products.<br>
Salmonella typhimurium contamination has been of special concern to the<br>
poultry processing industry because the organism is often present on live birds. Poultry<br>
processors have had great difficulty in removing microgrganisms, such as S. typhimurium,<br>
that attach or adhere to poultry tissues. A variety of chemical and physical approaches have<br>
been suggested for use during poultry processing to eliminate S. typhimurium contamination<br>
of carcasses and minimize cross-contamioation among carcasses. Trisodium phosphate<br>
(TSP) has been utilized in poultry processing for suppressing S. typhimurium; however,<br>
studies report conflicting results on the efficacy of TSP against Salmonella. As a result of<br>
its water solubility, TSP can be washed off of the poultry and thus, cannot inhibit<br>
attachment of microorganisms.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,366,983, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a<br>
method for removing or preventing Salmonella contamination of meat products by<br>
treatment with an effective amount of an aqueous solution of a QAC. Specifically,<br>
quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants, such as alkylpyridinium, particularly<br>
cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) were effective in<br>
removing S. typhimurium from poultry. This patent, however, does not disclose-that QACs<br>
have a broader antimicrobial spectrum against any other genuses of food contaminating<br>
microorganisms than Salmonella. Further, it does not suggest that this treatment method<br>
would be effective on food products other than meat. Additionally, it does not suggest that<br>
very short QAC application times can be utilized and still provide effective antimicrobial<br>
treatment. Nor does it suggest solutions of concentrated QACs, as disclosed in the present<br>
invention, that are particularly useful in preparing dilute QAC solutions.<br>
Food substances differ chemically and physically by virtue of their protein<br>
content, porosity, lipophilicity, surface pH, water permeability, surface area, and surface<br>
net electrical charge. Porosity of food could be important in the sequestration of bacteria<br>
whereas a tough, impermeable integument on a food substance could reduce bacterial<br>
contamination of the food. All of these chemical and physical differences among food<br>
products make it difficult to predict whether one antimicrobial agent"s success on meat<br>
products would suggest success on other food products, such as fruit, vegetables, seafood,<br>
dairy products, and pet foods or snacks.<br>
For example, the QAC, CPC, is known to bind to proteins; however, if the<br>
antimicrobial efficacy of CPC on food products was due in large part to the protein<br>
binding, then the present method for treating non-proteinaceous fruits and vegetables would<br>
not have been expected to be successful.<br>
Increasingly, foodborne illnesses caused by other pathogenic and spoilage<br>
bacteria than Salmonella have become a problem for food processors. A list of these<br>
bacteria with the products, in which they have been identified, is presented in Table 1:<br>
Among these contaminating microorganisms listed in the table, Escherichia<br>
coli O157:H7 is of special concern because of its virulence, severity of the illness<br>
produced, and associated mortality. E. coli O157:H7 produces strong "shiga-like" toxins<br>
that lead to blood clotting abnormalities, kidney failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome), and<br>
death. Even if recovery from the acute illness is complete, 15-30% of infected people with<br>
hemolytic uremic syndrome will have evidence of chronic kidney disease. The risks<br>
associated with contamination with E. coli O157:H7 are compounded by its reported<br>
resistance to antibiotics. In 1993, between 8,000-16,000 cases of foodborne illnesses were<br>
produced by E. coli 0157:H7 with an estimated cost of between 0.2 and 0.5 billion dollars.<br>
Another virulent food contaminant, Listeria monocytogenes has been found<br>
in meat, vegetables, and various milk products; and may cause sepsis, meningitis, and<br>
disseminated abscesses. L. monocytogenes is a cold tolerant microorganism capable of<br>
growing under refrigeration. In 1993, about 1,700 cases of foodborae illness were<br>
produced by L. monocytogenes with an estimated cost of between 0.1 and 0.2 billion<br>
dollars.<br>
Another microorganism of concern in the food industry is Aeromonds<br>
hydrophila which causes spoilage in the food and meat processing industry and reduces the<br>
shelf life of these products.<br>
Presently, there are no known microbiocidal compounds which are effective<br>
at preventing and removing contamination in a broad range of food products against a broad<br>
spectrum of gram positive, gram negative, aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and<br>
microaerophilic microorganisms. The present inventors have determined that QACs are<br>
effective against a broad spectrum of different microorganisms which produce foodborne<br>
illnesses when they become attached to a broad range of food products. This sensitivity of<br>
a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms could not have been predicted.<br>
Sensitivity of a microorganism to a particular antimicrobial agent is not<br>
predictive of the sensitivity of other microorganisms to the same agent. It is believed that<br>
antiseptics or germicides have a continuous spectrum of activity but the relative<br>
susceptibilities of different microorganisms must be considered. For example, the<br>
germicide, hexachlorophene is primarily effective against Gram positive microorganisms,<br>
and cationic antiseptics are not effective against sporulating organisms. Some Gram<br>
negative microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas cepacia, have been known to grow in<br>
solutions of the drag, benzalkonium chloride. Other bacteria have been known to be<br>
capable of growing in 70% ethanol (Harvey, S.C., Antimicrobial Drugs in Remington"s<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences. 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., pp. 1163-1241 1990).<br>
In regard to the treatment of food products, it has been reported that Listeria<br>
is more resistant to the action of TSP than Salmonella or E. coli (Someirs, E.B. et aL, Int.<br>
J. Food Microbiol.. 22:269-276, 1994). Further, (Breen et al., J. Food Sciences. 60:1991-<br>
1996, 1995) demonstrated that TSP is much less effective in inhibiting Salmonella growth<br>
than it is in detaching this organism. Similarly, TSP has reduced the numbers of E. coli<br>
O157:H7 on chicken carcasses but is ineffective in inhibiting the cross-contamination of<br>
this microorganism to other chickens.<br>
The present invention shows that QACs are effective against E. coli<br>
O157:H7 in suspension in liquids, in reducing the numbers of this bacteria when it is<br>
attached to food products, as well as in inhibiting the attachment of this bacteria to food<br>
products. It has been reported that E. coli O157:H7 shows resistance towards broad<br>
spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole (Kim. et al.,<br>
J. Infect. Dis.. 170:1606-1609, 1994) and oxytetracycline (Ciosek et al., Med. Weter.<br>
40:335,338:1984), whereas these same agents are very active against regular non-toxin-<br>
producing strains of E. coli.<br>
Clearly the effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent or biocide against a<br>
particular microorganism cannot be predicted based upon its effectiveness against a<br>
different microorganism. There are many factors to consider, such as microbial<br>
characteristics, which may play a role in the effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent against<br>
a particular microorganism. These characteristics may include but are not limited to: (1)<br>
the degree of glycocalyx formation by a given species of attached microorganism, (2) the<br>
presence of a lipopolysaccharide- and phospholipid-containing cell envelope in gram<br>
negative bacteria, (3) the presence of lipoprotein as in most enteric bacteria and<br>
Pseudomonas, and (4) the presence of porin protein channels, for example in E. coli and<br>
Salmonella (Fulton et al:, Structure in Medical Microbiology. 3rd Ed., pp. 37-54, 1991).<br>
The food processing industry, as well as home, restaurant or institutional<br>
food preparation, is in need of more effective products and processes for the prevention of<br>
growth of a broad range of contaminating microorganisms on many different food products<br>
and/or surfaces that the food products and juices or liquids from the food come in contact.<br>
This is especially true for microorganisms which are attached to the surfaces of food. As a<br>
result of increasing numbers of illnesses caused by foodborne pathogenic microorganisms,<br>
the food processing industry now requires more effective processes for the removal and<br>
prevention of a broader spectrum of microorgahisms, and particularly for pathogenic<br>
microorganisms, such as, toxin-producing Escherichia, i.e., E. coli O157.-H7, which are<br>
known to cause serious human diseases as a result of food contamination. The present<br>
invention provides a composition comprising a solution of concentrated QAC and at least<br>
one solubility enhancing agent and methods of preventing the growth of microorganisms<br>
on and in the food, as well as, in liquids and on surfaces associated with food products and<br>
their preparation. This method of prevention is an important goal in preventing cross-<br>
contamination from infected food products; in removing attached microorganisms from<br>
food products, in inhibiting the attachment of microorganisms to the food products; and in<br>
preventing the growth of microorganisms that remain attached to the food products,.<br>
Further, the method of the present invention can easily be adapted for use in a food<br>
processing plant.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides compositions comprising a<br>
solution comprising a concentrated amount of QAC in combination with at least one<br>
solubility enhancing agent or solvent. This concentrated QAC solution of the present<br>
invention provides a stock solution from which dilute compositions of QACs can be<br>
prepared for treatment of food products and surfaces associated with food product .<br>
processing and preparation, including the bodies of animals from which the food product is<br>
prepared. For example, the teats of dairy cows can be treated with a dilute solution of the<br>
concentrated QAC solution prior to milking, to enhance the safe processing of the milk and<br>
milk products. Additionally, a dilute solution of QAC may be useful for washing hands<br>
and bodies of humans and pets, with the components described herein or in combination<br>
with other components known to be useful hand and body washes. The concentrated QAC<br>
solutions are useful in preparing dilute working solution for use in the present method. The<br>
formulations of the present invention contain solubility enhancing components which allow<br>
more concentrated compositions of QACs to be prepared.<br>
U.S. 5,405,604 discloses a concentrated mouth rinse, methods of use and<br>
methods of manufacturing the mouth rinse. The mouth rinse is composed of a concentrated<br>
composition in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions that consists essentially of from about<br>
0.05% to about 10.0% of a QAC; from about 30% to about 85% of a solvent that acts as a<br>
carrier for flavoring oil, where the solvent is propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and<br>
mixtures thereof; from about 0.2% to about 9.0% of a flavoring oil and water. The<br>
composition of the present invention differs from the mouth rinse composition by<br>
containing greater than 10% QAC, by being a true homogenous solution rather than an<br>
emulsion and by not containing flavoring oils.<br>
WO 98/03066 discloses an antimicrobial composition, methods of<br>
preparation and methods of use. The composition is composed of subcomponent a) a<br>
substituted or unsubsiituted C1-C4 monocarboxylic acid approximately 50-99.9% by weight<br>
and subcomponent b) a microbiocidal or microbiostatic cationic organic nitrogen compound<br>
approximately 0.1-50% by weight. The composition of the present invention differs from<br>
this composition of WO 98/03066, in that it does contain a solubility enhancing agent and<br>
WO 98/03066 does not. The present invention differs from WO 98/03066, in that it does<br>
not contain an organic acid, such as a monocarboxylic acid, and specifically does not<br>
contain a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4 monocarboxylic acid which is the. primary<br>
component of the composition of WO 98/03066. The disclosure of WO 98/03066 recites<br>
that the efficacy of antimicrobial unsubstituted C1-C4 monocarboxylic acid containing<br>
• compositions against Salmonella can be enhanced by adding a cationic organic nitrogen<br>
compound. It is a theory of this invention that a cationic microbiocidal nitrogen compound<br>
is better able to exert its effect in microbes damaged by C1-C4 carboxylic acids. The<br>
compositions of this invention can additionally contain an additional organic acid that mixes<br>
with the cationic organic nitrogen compound to form an "ancat" or "catan" compound,<br>
which is not present in the composition of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The concentrated QAC solution of the present invention provides a<br>
concentrated antimicrobial solution that is easily diluted to a solution, that is contacted with<br>
food products, and surfaces associated with food products, including portions of live or<br>
dead animals, in the case of food products obtained from animals. The concentrated QAC<br>
solution of the present invention comprises a QAC and at least one solubility enhancing<br>
agent. Preferably the QAC is in a concentration of greater than about 10% by weight. The<br>
concentrated solution is diluted to provide a dilute growth inhibiting effective amount of<br>
QAC in an aqueous solution with the diluted solubility enhancing agent. QACs of the<br>
present invention are effective in preventing the growth of a broad spectrum of pathogenic<br>
and spoilage microorganisms. QACs, particularly cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), are<br>
especially effective in preventing the growth of a broad spectrum of microorganisms on a<br>
broad range of food products.<br>
The present invention provides a method for preventing growth of<br>
microorganisms on food products comprising contacting a food product with a microbial<br>
growth inhibiting effective amount of QAC for the prevention of growth of a broad<br>
spectrum of microorganisms on food products, where the application tune of the compound<br>
on the food product is for at least a fraction of a second. The prevention of growth of<br>
microorganisms on food products is intended to provide a food product that is devoid of or<br>
contains minimal numbers of viable microorganisms that could cause illness in humans or<br>
animals or spoilage of the food product prior to ingestion. The prevention of growth of<br>
microorganisms on food products is intended to include but is not limited to the following<br>
mechanisms: (1) removal of attached microorganisms from the food products; (2) inhibition<br>
of attachment of microorganisms to the food products; (3) killing or inactivation of attached<br>
microorganisms on the food products; and (4) killing or inactivation of microorganisms<br>
which are not attached to the food product but which are present in liquids associated with<br>
the food products during processing; such as in chill tanks, or which are present on surfaces<br>
associated with food preparation, liquids remaining on such surfaces, such as countertops,<br>
cutting boards and sinks, and equipment used in food preparation and sanitization of the<br>
food.<br>
The microorganisms intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention are those microorganisms, which are susceptible to QACs, and more specifically<br>
are microorganisms from the genus Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Campylobacter,<br>
Arcobacter, Listeria, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Salmonella, non-toxin-producing Escherichia,<br>
pathogenic toxin-producing Escherichia, and other foodborne microorganisms which are<br>
capable of causing microbial foodborne contamination of food for human or animal<br>
consumption.<br>
Additional intended microorganisms, which are also susceptible to QACs,<br>
are fungi, such as, Aspergillus flavum and Penicillium chrysogenum, and parasites, such as<br>
Entamoeba histolytica.<br>
The present invention has an important application in the food processing<br>
industry, as well as for home and institutional food preparation. QACs are readily "<br>
available and the cost of carrying out the method of the present invention is not expensive<br>
as compared to existing antimicrobial processes. Unlike existing treatments using, for<br>
example, TSP, the use of QACs does not alter the appearance, color, taste, or texture of the<br>
food product. A range of concentrations of QACs are effective in preventing broad<br>
spectrum microbial growth on food products. QACs are tested by the Ames assay for<br>
mutagenicity. The preferred QAC of the present invention, CPC, was shown to be<br>
nonmutagenic by the Ames assay. Further, CPC is already approved for human use in<br>
products for oral ingestion in preparations, such as Cepacol® lozenges which are orally<br>
ingested in amounts up to 20 mg per day.<br>
The present invention also is directed to an improved method of contacting<br>
food products with QAC, wherein the application time of the QAC to the food product is<br>
for at least a fraction of a second, and may be for a period of time ranging from about 0.1<br>
second to about 5 seconds. A range of about 1 to 2 seconds may also be used. It is<br>
important that the application time of the QAC be for a sufficient time to result in<br>
significant prevention of growth of microorganisms on die food products.<br>
The present invention also includes an improved method of contacting QACs<br>
with food products by spraying or misting the compound on the food product. The<br>
spraying or misting method can be performed using a QAC solution diluted in water or<br>
using the new concentrated formulation with QAC formulated with at least one solubility<br>
enhancing agent or the concentrated QAC formulation diluted in water. The direct spraying<br>
or misting of the concentrate may be possible if the percentage of QAC in the concentrate is<br>
approved for use on food products.<br>
The present invention is intended to encompass any method that contacts the<br>
QAC solution with a food product by any direct means, including spraying, misting,<br>
dipping, soaking. But the present invention also is intended to include contact of the QAC<br>
solution with the food by indirect means, such as applying the QAC solution, concentrated<br>
or dilute, to equipment or food product processing or preparation surfaces in which the<br>
food product is contacted during processing, preparation, storage and/or packaging.<br>
Further, the method of the present invention can optionally include a<br>
determination step prior to contacting the food product with the QACs to determine the<br>
presence of microorganisms on the food before treatment. Any conventional methods for<br>
rapidly determining the presence of microorganisms can be utilized as the determination<br>
step, which for example, includes PCR and immunoassays.<br>
Additionally, the method of the present invention optionally includes a step<br>
to determine the presence of QACs on the surface of the food product after contact with the<br>
QACs. This determination is performed immediately after the contacting step or after<br>
several washing steps. For example, the QAC is extracted from the tissues of the food in a<br>
form suitable for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The method<br>
comprises ethanol extraction of the food tissue followed by solid-phase extraction using a<br>
weak cationic exchange column that selectively separates QACs from other compounds in<br>
the matrix that would otherwise interfere with the HPLC analysis. The HPLC assay for<br>
quantitation of QAC residues employs a reverse phase cyano column and uses a QAC<br>
analog as an internal standard.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based upon the determination that QACs are useful<br>
to treat a broad range of food products to reduce a broad spectrum of foodborne microbial<br>
contamination on these food products and surfaces associated with the processing and<br>
preparation of these food products. The present invention is also based upon the finding<br>
that QACs are effective in removing, killing, inactivating and inhibiting the attachment of a<br>
broad range of foodborae pathogenic microorganisms to food products. These<br>
microorganisms include but are not limited to bacteria belonging to the genuses,<br>
Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Campylobacter, Arcobacter, Listeria,<br>
Aeromonas, Bacillus, non-toxin-producing Escherichia, and the virulent toxin-producing<br>
Escherichia strains, such as E. coli O157:H7; fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus and<br>
Penicillium chrysogenum; and parasites, such as Entamoeba histolytica.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of QAC in<br>
an aqueous solution. Particularly, the concentrated QAC solution of the present invention<br>
provides an ideal antimicrobial solution for use in industrial applications, where large<br>
quantities of diluted QAC solutions are needed for food processing. The concentrated<br>
solution of the present invention contains as a minimum number of components, GRAS<br>
(generally recognized as safe) components and solubility enhancing agents.<br>
The concentrated QAC solutions of the present invention provide many advantages<br>
in the preparation of diluted QAC solutions. Large amounts of QAC powder go into<br>
solution in an aqueous solvent containing at least one solubility enhancing agent. It is<br>
difficult to prepare concentrated solutions of QACs in water alone because the QAC<br>
precipitates out of solution. In fact, it is difficult to get more than about 5 to about 10%<br>
QACs, and under some conditions more than 1% of QAC in solution, depending upon the<br>
temperature of the solution without the aid of solubility enhancing agents. However, the<br>
present inventors have determined that concentrated solutions of QACs can be prepared, if<br>
prepared in combination with at least one solubility enhancing agent or solvent, such as an<br>
alcohol or a polyglycol, QACs are known cationic surfactants, and as such, the preparation<br>
of aqueous QAC solutions results in extensive foaming. However, when the concentrated<br>
QAC solution comprising a QAC witn a concentration of greater than 10% or greater than<br>
15% and at least one solubility enhancing agent is utilized to prepare dilute QAC solutions,<br>
the extensive foaming that usually arises when preparing aqueous solutions of QAC is<br>
greatly reduced. Minimal foaming occurs in the preparation of the concentrate, and once<br>
prepared, the concentrate does not exhibit foaming. Further, the concentrate is diluted with<br>
minimal agitation and, therefore, minimal foaming. If the concentrated QAC is exposed to<br>
cold temperatures, the concentrated QAC solution resists precipitation. If frozen, the<br>
concentrated QAC solution with at least one solubility enhancing agent goes into solution<br>
upon thawing. If a precipitate of the QAC remains after shipping or storage at ambient<br>
temperatures or frozen, then the temperature of the solution is raised until the precipitate<br>
disappears. Large quantities of QAC concentrates in large containers or drums can be<br>
wanned on a drum warmer, if necessary. Further, compared to dilute aqueous solutions of<br>
QACs, the concentrated QAC solution, in conjunction with the high concentrations of at<br>
least one solubility enhancing agent, such as appropriate water-miscible organic solvents,<br>
have a minimal risk of spoilage or limited shelf life. Additionally, the concentrated QAC<br>
solutions enhance end-user safety by eliminating inhalation exposure to QAC dust, which is<br>
a problem during the handling of QAC powder, particularly when handled in large<br>
quantities because it. can cause lung, eye, throat, nasal and skin irritation. The concentrated<br>
QAC solution decreases the volume and mass of solution to be transported and warehoused<br>
during industrial applications of QAC solutions. And most importantly, when the<br>
concentrated QAC solution is diluted in water to prepare dilute QAC solutions for<br>
application to food products, the, diluted concentrate solution demonstrates very good<br>
antimicrobial efficacy.<br>
The present invention is particularly directed to a concentrated QAC solution<br>
comprising a quaternary ammonium compound with a concentration from greater than<br>
about 10% by weight and at least one solubility enhancing agent. The solubility enhancing<br>
agent is any water-miscible organic solvent that enhances the solubility of the QAC powder<br>
in an aqueous solution so that it forms a solution at concentrations of greater than 10% by<br>
weight. A 10% by weight solution is made by weighing 10 grams of QAC and dissolving it<br>
in 90 grams of liquid that comprises at least one solubility enhancing agent and water, it<br>
water is necessary to bring the weight ID 90 grams of liquid. The concentrated QAC<br>
solution of the present invention comprises QAC in solution at concentrations of greater<br>
than about 10% by weight, and more preferably at cocceatrations of greater than about<br>
15% by weight. The concentrated QAC solution comprises QAC in solution at<br>
concentrations ranging from greater than about 10% or greater than about 15% by weight<br>
to about 60% by weight. Although a greater than about 60% by weight concentration of<br>
QAC can be used in the concentrated QAC solution, the upper limit that is useful is<br>
governed by the interaction between the % (or weight) of QAC and the solubility enhancing<br>
agent(s) used to prepare the cooctntrated solution. Specific solubility enhancing agents of<br>
combinations of these agents may result in higher than 60% QAC concentrated<br>
formulations. It is important to dissolve all of the QAC powder and get it into solution<br>
prior to preparing the dilute formulation to treat food products. Preferably, the QAC is<br>
present at a concentration from greater than about 10% or greater than about 15% by<br>
weight to about 50% by weight, and more preferably at a concentration from greater than<br>
about 10% or about 15% by weight to about 40% by weight. But the concentration of the<br>
QAC in the range of greater than about 10% to about 30% by weight or between about<br>
15% to about 25% by weight and within this range about 20% by weight is also useful in<br>
the present concentrate solution.<br>
The QAC concentrations in the present invention are described by concentrations as<br>
either parts per million (ppm) or % by weight, where 100,000 ppm is equal to 10% by<br>
weight. The examples utilize CPC and use both ppm or % to designate concentration.<br>
The solubility enhancing agent or a combination of these agents, and water if<br>
necessary, to make up the remaining weight of the solution, is added to reach 100% by<br>
weight. The solubility enhancing agent is any compatible solubility enhancing agent that<br>
solubilizes QACs at concentrations of greater than about 10% by weight is contemplated by<br>
the present invention, but alcohols are the preferred solubility enhancing agent.<br>
Additionally polyglycols are useful solubility enhancing agents, such as polyethylene<br>
glycol. The present invention contemplates using one or more of these solubility enhancing<br>
agents. More preferably, the alcohol is selected from the group consisting of a monohydric<br>
alcohol, a dihydric alcohol, a trihydric alcohol, and a combination thereof. Any one of<br>
these types of alcohols can be used alone or in combination with one or more of the other<br>
types of alcohols to obtain the desired % by weight of the solubility enhancing agent. If a<br>
" monohydric alcohol is utilized, then this type of alcohol is preferably an aliphatic alcohol,<br>
and more preferably is ethyl alcohol. If a dihydric alcohol is utilized, then a glycol or a<br>
derivative thereof, is preferred. Of the glycols, propylene glycol is most preferred and is<br>
available from any number of suppliers. Propylene glycol provides advantages oyer other<br>
alcohols, as a solubility enhancing agent of high concentrations of QACs, such as CPC.<br>
Trihydric alcohols, such as glycerol or derivatives thereof, are also useful as a solubility<br>
enhancing agent in the present concentrated CPC solution. The choice of the alcohol<br>
depends upon the food product that is contacted and is selected, to be compatible with<br>
treatment steps prior to or after the QAC contact with the food product. If a polyglycol is<br>
used as the solubility enhancing agent, then polyethylene glycol is preferred, and<br>
particularly the lower molecular weight species with an average molecular weight of less<br>
than or equal to 600, are well known and possess properties similar to propylene glycol.<br>
If ethyl alcohol is used as the solubility enhancing agent, it is present at a<br>
concentration up to about 49% by weight. Ranges of ethyl alcohol about 0.5% weight to<br>
about 49% by weight, from about 10% by weight to about 40% by weight, from about 15%<br>
by weight to about 30% by weight, and within the range at about 20% is useful in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The concentrated QAC solution contains at least one solubility enhancing agent,<br>
such as an alcohol at a concentration of up to about 70% by weight. More preferably, the<br>
alcohol is present at a concentration of up to about 60% by weight, and may range from<br>
about 10% by weight to about 60% by weight. The concentration of the solubility<br>
enhancing agent varies depending on the % weight of the QAC, which is to be dissolved in<br>
solution, as well as the particular intended use of the concentrated QAC solution and<br>
dilutions thereof.<br>
Preferably the concentrated QAC solution comprises a QAC at a concentration of<br>
about 40% by weight and at least one alcohol at a concentration ranging from between<br>
about 50% by weight to about 60% by weight with water making up the remaining %<br>
weight. The preferred alcohol in this solution is propylene glycol. More preferably, the<br>
concentrated QAC solution comprises a QAC at a concentration of about 40% by weight<br>
and at least one alcohol at a concentration ranging between about 55% by weight to about<br>
60% by weight and water present at about 5% by weight. The most preferred concentrated<br>
QAC solution comprises a QAC at a concentration of about 40% by weight, an alcohol at a<br>
concentration of about 57% by weight and water present at about 3% by weight. Again,<br>
the preferred alcohol in this solution is propylene glycol.<br>
However, also useful is a concentrated QAC solution comprising a QAC at a<br>
concentration of about 40% by weight and at least one alcohol at a concentration of up to<br>
about 50% by weight, and preferably about 50% by weight. In this concentrated aqueous<br>
solution, the solubility enhancing agent may be a combination of alcohols, such as ethyl<br>
alcohol and propylene glycol. But glycerol also is useful as the solubility enhancing agent,<br>
alone or in combination with other alcohols or poly glycols. Glycerol is useful for this<br>
purpose at a concentration of up to and including about 20% by weight, and also is useful<br>
at concentrations ranging from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight, and within this range<br>
at about 1% . Glycerol is useful in methods where propylene glycol is not the alcohol of<br>
choice for solubilizing the QAC. A further useful concentrated QAC solution comprises a<br>
QAC at a concentration of about 20% by weight and at least one alcohol at a concentration<br>
of about 50% by weight, such as a combination of ethyl alcohol and propylene glycol, and<br>
preferably where each alcohol is present at about 25% by weight.<br>
The QAC useful in the present concentrated QAC solution is selected from<br>
the group consisting of alkylpyridinium, tetra-alkylammonium and alkylalicyclic<br>
ammonium salts.<br>
Alkylpyridinium is represented by the structural formula (I):<br>
wherein n is 9-21; and X is a halide.<br>
Tetra-alkylammonium is represented by the structural formula (IT):<br>
wherein n is 9-21; R is selected from the group consisting of CH3 and C2H5;<br>
and X is a halide.<br>
Alkylalicyclic ammonium salts are represented by the structural formula<br>
(III):<br>
wherein n is 9-21; Z is 4-5; R is selected from the group consisting of CH3<br>
and C2H5; and X is a halide.<br>
A variety of QACs, all of which are cationic surface-active agents; i.e.,<br>
surfactants, are evaluated for their effectiveness in removing attached microorganisms from<br>
various foods as well as in inhibiting the attachment of the microorganisms. Of the QACs<br>
studied, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was the most effective and is utilized in the<br>
examples set forth below but it not intended to limit the use of QACs to CPC within the<br>
meaning of the present invention because other members of QACs also have similar<br>
properties against the foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. QACs containing between 12<br>
to 16 carbons on the long side chain possess maximum antimicrobial activity. CPC, the<br>
preferred QAC, contains 16 carbons in the long side chain.<br>
The present invention further involves the dilution of the concentrated QAC<br>
solution, including at least solubility enhancing agent, and water, if required to obtain the<br>
desired % by weight of CPC, and the contacting of this diluted QAC solution with a food<br>
product to prevent microbial growth or attachment on the food product. The diluted QAC<br>
solution comprises QAC at a concentration of up to and including about 1% QAC by<br>
weight. This % by weight is the current acceptable concentration of QAC under<br>
consideration to treat food products by the United States Department of Agriculture. The<br>
amount of QAC that remains on a particular food product varies with the different types of<br>
foods treated and the method of application. The concentrated QAC solution described in<br>
the present invention is diluted with water to obtain a dilute solution with the QAC ranging<br>
from about .01% up to and including about 1% but may be increased or decreased<br>
depending upon the food product treated and the application method used. The<br>
concentrated QAC solution, that was prepared on a weight to weight basis as described<br>
previously, is diluted to obtain the desired treatment QAC concentration by a volume to<br>
volume dilution. For example, a 40% concentrated QAC solution is diluted to 1% QAC by<br>
diluting 2.5 milliliters of the QAC concentrate with 97.5 millilters of water. In a food<br>
processing plant, this volume to volume dilution is preferred because it is easy to prepare.<br>
However, a weight to weight dilution also may be used to prepare dilute QAC solutions, in<br>
which 2.5 grams of a 40% by weight QAC solution is mixed with 97.5 grams of water to<br>
obtain a 1% QAC solution. The dilution of the QAC in the concentrated solution also<br>
results in the dilution of the solubility enhancing agent that is in the concentrated solution.<br>
The diluted QAC concentrate solution is useful for contacting the food product by spraying,<br>
misting, immersion, and any other contact method that is suitable for contact of the dilute<br>
QAC solution with the food product, including indirect contact, such as contacting<br>
equipment or food product processing or preparation surfaces that are contacted with the<br>
food during processing, preparation, storage and/or packaging. The shorter the application<br>
. time of the QAC solution, the better, particularly for industrial and commercial food<br>
processing purposes.<br>
The present invention is further based on the determination that the<br>
application time of the QACs with the food product in the spraying or misting process can<br>
be reduced to as low as about at least 0.1 second while still resulting in significant<br>
inhibition of microorganism attachment, for foodborne microorganisms, which is a<br>
significant improvement and a commercial advantage in the industrial use of this process.<br>
The misting or spraying application process allows an application time of the dilute QAC<br>
solution with the food product for as short a time as up to 20 seconds, but more preferably<br>
for about 10 seconds or less, and more preferably for about 5 seconds or less. The most .<br>
preferred range of application time of the QAC on the food product is from about 0.1<br>
second to about 5 seconds, and within that range, from about 0.1 to about 2 seconds also is<br>
useful, with a preferred range of about 0.5 second to about 2 seconds. It should be<br>
understood that the present invention contemplates as short an application time of the dilute<br>
QAC solution as is physically possible, while still resulting in inhibition of microorganisms<br>
on the food products or in the liquid and surfaces in which.the food product contacts.<br>
Therefore, different intervals of time less than 20 seconds are contemplated by the present<br>
invention.<br>
Any type of method of contact of the QAC with the food product is useful in<br>
the present method as long as it is capable of allowing a short application time. A method<br>
that utilizes a cabinet that provides spraying or misting of the food product is useful in the<br>
present invention. Machinery for use in such cabinets on a processing line in a food<br>
processing plant are adaptable for reducing the application time to a minimum while still<br>
obtaining efficacious antimicrobial effects on the food. All of these short application<br>
times; i.e., less than 20 seconds, and as low as 0.1 second, significantly reduce the viable<br>
foodborne microorganisms on these food products. Additionally, a very small amount of<br>
QAC diluted solution is necessary for the spraying or misting treatment, for example, as<br>
little as about 1 ounce of diluted QAC solution per pound of food product is useful for<br>
efficacious treatment.<br>
The present method of short QAC application time in a poultry processing<br>
plant is useful for treating post-chilled chickens, that have been immersed in a chill bath of<br>
cold water. The chickens are removed from the chill bath and treated with the diluted QAC<br>
solution of the present invention for an application time of less than about 20 seconds,<br>
preferably less than about 10 seconds, more preferably less than about 5 seconds, most<br>
preferably less than about 2 seconds, and even as short as 0.1 second. The treated chickens<br>
are subsequently packaged without further washing or rinsing. However, the method<br>
optionally may include, if deemed necessary, at least one washing step of the chickens prior<br>
to packaging. The optional washing step may include spraying or misting the food product<br>
with water or immersing the food product in a container or tank of water.<br>
The above described aspects of the present invention are described in detail<br>
below with in certain examples with reference to Figs. 1-5.<br>
The examples set forth below serve to further illustrate the present invention<br>
in its preferred embodiments, and are not intended to limit the present invention. The<br>
examples utilize poultry, beef, catfish, broccoli, and grapes as the food products treated in<br>
the method, but it is intended that the treatment of other food products, which would not be<br>
adversely affected by the treatment process are also intended to be encompassed by the<br>
present invention.<br>

Experiments were conducted by 16 hour incubation at 37°C for Staphylococcus aureus,<br>
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. For<br>
Aeromonas hydrophila, and Bacillus cereus incubations were performed at 30°C . MIC<br>
were determined by the lowest dilution with no visible turbidity. Table 2 shows the data<br>
from the above experiment:<br>

Campylobacter jejuni and Arcobacter butzleri were determined in Mueller Hinton broth<br>
(BBL Microbiology System) using the macrodilution method established by the 1987<br>
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Experiments were conducted by<br>
microaerophilic incubation at 37°C for 48 hours. An aliquot of each dilution was pour<br>
plated in agar and incubated in microaerophilic conditions at 37°C for 48 hours. MBCs<br>
were determined as the lowest dilution with no growth. Table 3 shows the data from the<br>
above experiment:<br>
The MIC and MBC data shows that CPC is effective against a broad range of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Activity of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds in Plaaktonic Cells<br>
A 16-hour culture of each of E. coli O157:H7 in trypticase soy broth was<br>
centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C). After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was<br>
washed with 10 ml 0.04M potassium phosphate buffer (PPB, pH 7.0), and suspended in<br>
PPB to a final suspension of 1-2 x 109 cells/ml. Aliquots (1.0 ml) were centrifuged (14,000<br>
rpm, 3 min), and the supernatants were removed. Each pellet was suspended in either 1 ml<br>
of an aqueous solution of various concentrations (100-1,000 mg/ml) of test composition<br>
(CPC) or 1.0 ml of PPB, vortexed (30 sec), incubated for 1 min at 25°C, and centrifiiged<br>
(14,000 rpm, 3 min). After removal of the supernatant, each pellet was suspended in 0.5<br>
ml PPB. Cells from each sample were counted using duplicate 0.05 ml aliquots and<br>
standard serial dilution techniques on trypticase soy agar, and the data recorded as mean<br>
colony-forming units (CFU)/ml.<br>
The results of the above experiment show complete reduction of viable E.<br>
coli O157:H7 in suspension was achieved at all concentrations of CPC tested (100, 250,<br>
500, and 1000µg/ml). The results of this experiment are particularly significant for the<br>
prevention of cross contamination with E. coli O157:H7 in industrial processing of meat.<br>
As discussed above, this strain of toxin-producing E. coli shows resistance to many broad<br>
spectrum antimicrobial agents. These results provide evidence that treatment of meat<br>
products with QAC will prevent one contaminated piece of meat from contaminating other<br>
uncontaminated pieces because the QAC will kill the organism in the liquid which is the<br>
transfer agent responsible for the cross contamination.<br>
 Example 2<br>
Effects of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on the Reduction of Viable Bacteria<br>
attached to Chicken Skin<br>
Chicken skins (2.5 x 2.5 cm) excised from a drumstick, sterilized by a 45<br>
KGy dose of irradiation from an electron source, were placed epidermal side up in each<br>
well of six-well tissue culture plate. Each skin piece was inoculated with 5 ml 0.008 M<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 6-8 x 103 CFU/ml bacteria with the<br>
exception of the background control group that was treated only with 5 ml of PBS. The<br>
plates were incubated (30 min, 35°C), and each skin piece was rinsed (2X, 5ml PBS) to<br>
remove loosely bound (unattached) microorganisms. Each inoculated skin was treated with<br>
5 ml of PBS containing CPC. Three pieces of skin were used for each concentration of<br>
CPC, including one in which the skins were treated only with 5 ml of PBS (0<br>
concentration). The plates were incubated with shaking (100 rpm) for 30 min at 25°C.<br>
After incubation, each skin piece was rinsed (5 ml PBS), placed in a sterile plastic bag<br>
containing 80 ml of saline or 1% peptone, and homogenized for 2 minutes using a<br>
laboratory blender (Stomacher® 400, Seward Medical, London, England). Three aliquots<br>
of the homogenate (1 ml) were pour-plated and incubated (37°C, 18-24 hr). Bacterial<br>
colonies were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as CFU/skin.<br>
These studies show the reduction in viable bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium,<br>
Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli (non-toxin producing strain)<br>
and Escherichia coli O157:H7) after treatment with 50 to 1000 ppm concentrations of CPC.<br>
Higher concentrations of CPC up to 8,000 ppm were tested against Escherichia coli<br>
O157.H7 and found to reduce the number of attached bacteria to below 0.1%. These<br>
studies show significant inhibition of the growth of these five bacteria on chicken skin.<br>
Example 3<br>
Effects of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on the Inhibition of Bacterial<br>
Attachment to Chicken Skin<br>
Chicken skins (2.5 x 2.5cm) excised from a drumstick, sterilized by a 45<br>
KGy dose of irradiation from an electron source, were placed epidermal side up in each<br>
well of six-well tissue culture plate. Each skin piece was inoculated with 5 ml 0.008 M<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing CPC. Three pieces of skin were used<br>
for each concentration of test compound, including one in which the skins were treated only<br>
with 5 ml of PBS (0 concentration). The plates were incubated with shaking (100 rpm) for<br>
various times (1 min or 10 min) at 25°C. The incubating solution was removed by<br>
aspiration, and the skins were rinsed (5 ml PBS), and then incubated 30 min, 35°C with 5<br>
ml of PBS containing 6-8 x 103CFU/ml bacteria. After incubation, each skin piece was<br>
rinsed (2X, 5 ml PBS), to remove loosely bound (unattached) microorganisms, placed in a<br>
sterile plastic bag containing 80 ml of saline or 1% peptone, and homogenized for 2<br>
minutes using a laboratory blender (Stomacher® 400, Seward Medical, London, England).<br>
Three aliquots of the homogenate (1 ml) were pour-plated and incubated (37°C, 18-24 hr).<br>
Bacterial colonies were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as CFU/skin.<br>
These studies show the inhibition of attachment of bacteria (Salmonella<br>
typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli (non-toxin<br>
producing strain) and Escherichia coli O157:H7) to chicken skin after treatment with 50 to<br>
1000 ppm concentrations of CPC. The data in these studies show that pretreating chicken<br>
skin with CPC significantly inhibits the attachment of these microorganisms to the chicken<br>
skin.<br>
Treating chicken skin with CPC for only 1 minute results in significant<br>
inhibition of attachment of S. typhimurium at 500 ppm and 1000 ppm. This shorter contact<br>
time of QAC with the meat products supports using shorter contact times than have been<br>
previously reported as being effective. Generally, chill tank immersions can for up to 60<br>
minutes but the data presented herein supports that a shorter contact or immersion time can<br>
be used which still results in significant reduction in the number of viable microorganisms.<br>
The CPC contacting step of the present invention can he performed for approximately 20<br>
seconds to about 60 minutes. The present invention also discloses useful contact times<br>
within this range of less than 10 minutes, and at ranges of about 20 seconds to about 9<br>
minutes, of about 20 seconds to about 5 minutes, and of about 20 seconds to about 90<br>
seconds.<br>

Beef flank tissue squares (2.5 x 2.5 cm) approximately 0.5 cm thick,<br>
sterilized by a 45 KGy dose of irradiation from an electron source, were placed in each well<br>

phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 6-8 x 103CFU/ml bacteria with the<br>
exception of the background control group that was treated only with 5 ml of PBS. The<br>
plates were incubated (30 rain, 35°C), and each square was closed (2X, 5ml PBS) to<br>
remove loosely bound (unattached) microorganisms. The inoculated squares were treated<br>
with.5 ml of PBS containing the CPC. Three pieces of tissue were used for each<br>
concentration of test compound, including one in which the squares wete treated only with<br>
5 ml of PBS (0 concentration). The plates were incubated with shaking (100 rpm) for 30<br>
min at 25ºC. After incubation, each square was rinsed (5 ml PBS), placed in a sterile<br>
plastic bag containing 50 ml of 1% peptone, and homogenized for 2 minuts using a<br>
laboratory blender (Stomacher® 400, Seward Medical, London, England). Three aliquots<br>
of the bomogenate (1 ml) were pour-plated and incubated (37ºC 18-24 hr). Bacterial<br>
colonies were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as CFU/square.<br>
The results of this study show a reduction in viable Escherichia coli<br>
O157:H7 after treatment with 50 to 1000ppm concentrations of CPC on beef flank tissue<br>
with 62-64% reduction in attached bacteria at 500 and 1000 ppm CPC.<br>

Effects of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on the Inhibition of Bacterial<br>
Attachment to Beef Flank Tissue<br>
Beef flank tissue squares (2.5 x 2.5cm), approximately 0.5 cm thick,<br>
sterilized by a 45 KGy dose of irradiation, from an electron source, were placed in each well<br>
of six-well tissue culture plate. Each tissue piece was treated with 5 ml 0.008 M phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing CPC. Three pieces of beef tissue were used for<br>
each concentration of test compound, including one in which the squares were treated only<br>
with 5 ml of PBS (0 concentration). The culture plates were incubated with shaking (100<br>
rpm) for 10 minutes at 25°C, The incubating solution was removed by aspiration, and the<br>
squares were rinsed (5 ml PBS), and then incubated (30 min, 35aC) with 5 ml of PBS<br>
containing 6-8 x 103CFU/ml bacteria. After incubation, each tissue piece was rinsed (2X, 5<br>
ml PBS), to remove loosely bound (unattached) microorganisms, placed in a sterile plastic<br>
bag containing 50 ml of 1% peptone, and homogenized for 2 minutes using a laboratory<br>
blender (Stomacher® 400, Seward Medical, London, England). Three aliquots of the<br>
homogenate (1 ml) were pour-plated and incubated (37°C, 18-24 hr). Bacterial colonies<br>
were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as CFU/square.<br>
The results of this study show the inhibition of attachment of Escherichia<br>
coli O157:H7 after treatment with 50 to 1000 ppm of CPC with a 76% reduction in the<br>
number of bacteria attached to the beef at concentrations of 1000 ppm CPC. Fig. 1 shows<br>
the results of a separate trial using higher concentrations of CPC and the same experimental<br>
procedure. At 20,000 ppm CPC, the bacteria was completely inhibited from attaching to<br>
beef.<br>
Example 6<br>
Pre-Chill Poultry spraying with 0.1% Cetylpyridinium Chloride<br>
A spraying test chamber was designed and constructed for use in a poultry<br>
processing pilot plant. The spraying test system consisted of a testing chamber, a spraying<br>
water storage tank, a pressure pump, a filter, pressure regulators, a plastic spraying<br>
chamber with eight nozzles located on four sides, and a used water collector. There were<br>
three nozzles on each of the pipes for front and back spraying. One nozzle was used for<br>
top spraying and one nozzle for bottom spraying. The chamber dimensions preferably are<br>
3x3x3 feet. With a high pressure booster pump, the pressure could be adjusted between<br>
0-140 psi. The distance between the spraying nozzles and the chicken carcass was 12-15<br>
inches. The top nozzle was used to spray the inside of the chicken carcass. Flat-cone<br>
spraying nozzles (1/8TK-SS1, Spraying Systems Co.) were used.<br>
The spray solution in the storage tank was pumped to the pressure regulator,<br>
and then sprayed through the nozzles in the chamber. In the spraying chamber, several<br>
spraying layers consisting of stainless steel nozzles and pipes were installed, and the<br>
chamber was covered with plastic sheets to prevent chemical drift. A shackle was used to<br>
hang up a chicken carcass in the chamber.<br>
Pre-chill chicken carcasses were obtained from a local poultry processing<br>
plant. They were taken from the end of an evisceration processing line, transported to the -<br>
research laboratory, and immediately used for the tests. The time elapsed between the<br>
processing plant and the research laboratory was less than one half hour. The temperature<br>
of chicken carcasses was hi the range of 32-37°C.<br>
Chicken carcasses were inoculated by spraying 1 ml of S. typhimurium at 1 x<br>
lO6 CFU/ml and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The inoculated chicken<br>
carcasses were rinsed by spraying tap water at 30 psi and 22°C for 5 sec. to wash off<br>
loosely attached Salmonella cells. Then each carcass was hung in the spraying chamber<br>
and sprayed with one of the test compounds. After spraying, each chicken carcass was<br>
rinsed with tap water for 20 sec. The chicken carcasses were then washed with buffered<br>
peptone water in a plastic bag on an automatic shaker to get samples for microbial analysis.<br>
The color of chicken skin was examined visually by comparing the birds treated with test<br>
compounds, such as QACs, with untreated birds.<br>
CPC at a concentration of 1000 ppm was used at different spraying pressures<br>
and durations. Spraying water temperature was set at room temperature of 22°C.<br>
Pressures were set at 30, 50, and 120 psi, and duration at 30 and 90 sec. Three replicates<br>
were performed for each trial. Reduction of S. typhimurium on chicken carcasses was<br>
compared among test compound sprayed, water sprayed, and non-sprayed groups.<br>
After spraying treatments, each carcass was mechanically shaken with 100<br>
ml of buffered peptone water (BPW) for 1 min, and then the wash water was collected.<br>
The samples were diluted, enriched, plated on XLT agar or Petrifilm (3M,Inc.; St, Paul,<br>
MN for total aerobic count plates) and incubated for 18-24 hours at 37°C. Then, colony<br>
forming units were counted. The number of attached bacteria was calculated using a most-<br>
probable-number technique. The most probable numbers of Salmonella and total aerobic<br>
plate counts were performed for each carcass using the wash water samples. An analysis of<br>
variance was used to analyze the experimental data to determine any significant differences<br>
among the treatment groups and controls (SAS/STAT User"s Guide, SAS Institute, Inc.,<br>
Cary, NC 1993).<br>
The results of this experiment show that 30 and 90 second spraying of 1000<br>
ppm solution of CPC at pressures of 30, 50, and 120 psi cause a significant reduction in the<br>
number of Salmonella on chicken carcasses. This data shows that the spraying method is a<br>
viable alternate method to the standard method of immersion or dipping of chickens when<br>
sprayed for 30 seconds to 90 seconds with a pressure in the range of 30 to 120 psi at 0.1 %<br>
CPC concentration. It may be possible to use lower concentrations of CPC with varying<br>
spray pressures within the disclosed range of 30 to 120 or greater psi aod varyisg spray<br>
times to obtain the most efficient process which results in significant reduction in the<br>
foodborne microorganisms. The spraying method would be advantageous to use in<br>
industrial processes because many chicken carcasses could be sprayed automatically for<br>
short periods of time and yet result in significant reduction of pathogenic bacteria.<br>

Effective Concentration and Time Study of the Effects of Quaternary Ammonium<br>
Compounds on S. typhimurium on Chicken Skin<br>
The effects of CPC on the inhibition and reduction of viable S. typhimurium<br>
on chicken skin were studied. Test solutions comprised various concentrations of CPC<br>
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in 5% (v/v) glycerin in 0.008 M, pH 7.2 phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS). The solutions were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts<br>
of CPC in the glycerin-PBS mixture. Skin squares (2.5 x 2.5 cm) from drumsticks of<br>
freshly frozen, unprocessed chickens were sterilized by a 45 kGy dose of itradiation<br>
(electron beam from a linear accelerator, Iowa State University). The source of S.<br>
typhimurium was ATCC strain # 14028 or NCTC strain # 12023). All colony counts were<br>
performed on tryptic soy agar (TSA; DDPCO, Detroit, MI) plates. Salmonella storage was<br>
on TSA. Inoculum preparation was performed as follows. A flask containing 50 ml tryptic<br>
soy broth was inoculated with S. typhimurium from a single colony and then incubated<br>
(37°C) with shaking (150 rpm) overnight. A one ml aliquot of the culture was washed with<br>
9 ml PBS (4800 rpm, 10 min.) two times. The pellet was resuspended in PBS to obtain a<br>
final cell concentration (spectrophotometrically, 420 nm) of 1 to 2 x 106 colony forming<br>
units (CFU) per ml.<br>
Chicken skin was excised from drumsticks and placed epidermal side up in<br>
each well of six-well tissue culture plates. Skin pieces were inoculated with 5 ml of PBS<br>
containing 1 to 2 x 106 CFU of S. typhimurium per ml, with the exception of the<br>
background control group that was treated only with 5 ml of PBS. Culture plates with the<br>
skin pieces were incubated (30 min., 35°C), and then the incubating solution was removed<br>
by aspiration. The inoculated skins were treated with 5 ml of the test solution. Sets of<br>
three pieces of skin were used for each concentration of test solution, including one set in<br>
which the skins were treated only with 5 ml of 5% (v/v) glycerin in PBS (0 concentration).<br>
The plates were incubated at 25°C with shaking (100 rpm) for 1, 3, or 10 min. After<br>
incubation, each skin piece was rinsed with aspiration (5 ml PBS), placed in a sterile plastic<br>
bag containing 50 ml of 0.1%. (w/v) peptone, and homogenized for 2 minutes using a<br>
Stomacher® 400 laboratory blender (Seward Medical Co., London, England). A corner of<br>
the bag was aseptically cut and the entire contents were transferred to a sterile centrifuge<br>
tube, which was then spun for 10 min (12,000 rpm, 20°C). The pellet was resuspended in<br>
5 ml 0.1% (w/v) peptone/water. One ml of the appropriate dilution was pour plated onto<br>
TSA agar in triplicate and then incubated at 37°C for 24 hour, after which colonies were<br>
counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as CFU/skin. The results show that<br>
Salmonella reduction was dependent upon both CPC concentration and time of exposure.<br>
Nearly a 5 log10 decontamination was achieved by treating with CPC solutions of 4000 and<br>
8000 ppm for contact times as low as 3 min.<br>
Skin squares were placed epidermal side up in each well of six-well tissue<br>
culture plates. Skin pieces were treated with 5 ml of the test solution. Sets of three pieces<br>
of skin were used for each concentration of test solution, including one set in which the<br>
skins were treated only with 5 ml of 5% (v/v) glycerin in PBS (0 concentration). Culture<br>
plates with the skin pieces were incubated at 25°C with shaking (100 rpm) for 1, 3, or 10<br>
min. The incubating solution was removed by aspiration, and the skins were rinsed (5 ml<br>
PBS) and then incubated (30 min., 35°C) with 5 ml of PBS containing 1 to 2 x lO6 CFU of<br>
S. typhimurium per ml. After incubation, each Skin piece was rinsed with aspiration (5 ml<br>
PBS), placed in a sterile plastic bag containing 50 ml of 0.1% (w/v) peptone, and<br>
homogenized for 2 minutes using a Stomacher® 400 laboratory blender. Three aliquots of<br>
the homogenates (1 ml) were pour-plated onto TSA agar and incubated at 37°C for 24 h and<br>
then colonies were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as logl0 CFU/skin. The<br>
results indicate that prevention of Salmonella contamination by pretreatment with CPC also<br>
showed concentration and time dependency. The most marked effects were observed for 10<br>
minute pretreatment times where a 4.9 log10 inhibition of Salmonella attachment was shown<br>
at a concentration of 8,000 ppm. This result is important since prevention of cross-<br>
contamination is of paramount importance in food processing.<br>
Values of log10 CFU/skin for controls were within the range 4,61 to 5.03.<br>
Differences between treated samples and controls were analyzed using ANOVA followed<br>
by Newman-Keals multiple range analysis and were statistically significant (p 
In another spraying experiment, a 3.3 log10 reduction of Salmonella was<br>
obtained after a 90 second spraying of chicken carcasses with a 5,000 ppm solution of<br>

The steps of Example 2 were followed except that L. monocytogenes was<br>
used to inoculate the chicken skin and the media in the plastic bag used in the Stomacher<br>
400 contained 0.1% peptone. At concentrations of CPC of 2000 ppm or higher, there was<br>
greater man a 4 log10 reduction in L. monocytogenes.<br>

The steps of Example 3 were followed except that L. monocytogenes was<br>
used to inoculate the chicken skin and the media in the plastic bag used in the Stomacher<br>
400 contained 0.1% peptone. The results of this study show a reduction of 82% of<br>
attached bacteria at 50 ppm, reduction of 92% at 100 ppm, and reduction of 100% at 500<br>
and 1000 ppm.<br>
Example 10<br>
Effects of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on the Reduction of viable Salmonella<br>
typhimurium attached to Catfish, Black Grapes, and Broccoli<br>
The effects of CPC on the reduction of. viable S. typhimurium on catfish,<br>
black grapes, and broccoli were studied. Test solutions comprised various concentrations<br>
of CPC (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in 5% (v/v) glycerin in 0.008 M, pH 7.2<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The solutions were prepared by dissolving the<br>
 appropriate amounts of CPC in the glycerin-PBS mixture.<br>
Food samples were small intact black grapes, broccoli florets, and catfish<br>
skin squares (2.5 x 2.5 cm) excised from unprocessed, freshly thawed catfish. The fruit<br>
and vegetables were purchased from a local grocery, while the fish was shipped frozen<br>
from a local catfish supplier. The source of S. typhimurium was ATCC strain # 14028 or<br>
NCTC strain # 12023).<br>
All colony counts were performed using Salmonella-selective XLD agar<br>
(DIFCO, Detroit, MI) plates. Additionally, in the catfish experiments, total aerobic colony<br>
counts were performed using a non-selective medium, tryptic soy agar (TSA:DIFCO,<br>
Detroit, MI). Salmonella storage was on TSA.<br>
Inoculum preparation for S. typhimurium was performed as described in<br>
Example 7 above. Food samples were placed in each well of six-well tissue culture .plates.<br>
The samples were then inoculated with 5 ml of PBS containing 1 to 2 x 106 CFU of S.<br>
typhimurium per ml, with the exception of the background control group that was treated<br>
only with 5 ml of PBS. Culture plates with the food samples were incubated (30 min.,<br>
35°C), and then the incubating solution was removed by aspiration. The inoculated<br>
samples were treated with 5 ml of the test solution. Sets of three food samples were used<br>
for each concentration of test solution, including one set in which the food samples were<br>
treated only with 5 ml of 5% (v/v) glycerin in PBS (0 concentration). The plates were<br>
incubated at 25°C with shaking (100 rpm) for 3 min. After incubation, each food sample<br>
was prepared and placed in a plastic bag for use with the Stomacher® 400 laboratory<br>
blender as described in Example 7 above. A comer of the bag was aseptically cut and the<br>
entire contents were transferred to a sterile centrifuge tube, which was then spun for 10 min<br>
(12,000 rpm, 20°C). The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml 0.1% (w/v) peptone/water. One<br>
ml of the appropriate dilution was pour plated onto XLD agar for the grape and broccoli<br>
experiments and onto both XLD and TSA agar for the catfish in triplicate. After incubation<br>
at 37°C for 24 hour, colonies were counted, corrected for dilution, and reported as<br>
CFU/skin for catfish and as CFU/gram for the other food samples. The results of these<br>
experiments are shown in Figs. 2-5. As the catfish were not irradiated, Fig. 2 shows the<br>
total aerobic bacterial count on non-selective media whereas Fig. 3 shows only Salmonella<br>
counts.<br>
Example 11<br>
Effect of Spraying Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on the Reduction of Viable<br>
Bacteria on Whole Chickens<br>
These experiments tested the effect that spraying QACs on whole chicken<br>
carcasses using a commercial sprayer would have on the reduction of viable bacteria. The<br>
bacterial inoculating solutions were made as follows: E. coli (ATTC # 25922) was grown<br>
in brain heart infusion broth (BHI) for 20-24 h and then diluted to a 1:1000 concentration<br>
by adding 0.5 ml of E. coli culture to 500 ml of physiological saline solution (PSS). S.<br>
typhimurium was grown in BHI for 20-24 h and then diluted to a 1:5000 concentration by<br>
adding 0.1 ml of S. typhimurium culture to 500 ml of physiological saline solution (PSS).<br>
The CPC treatment solution was prepared to a concentration of 5,000 ppm. Prechill chicken<br>
carcasses were obtained from a local poultry, processing plant for each trial. The carcasses<br>
were placed on a shackle line and 1 ml of the bacterial inoculating solution was sprayed on .<br>
the breast of the carcass, and 1 ml was sprayed on the back. The bacteria were allowed to<br>
attach for 30 min at room temperature. After attachment the carcasses were rinsed on the<br>
shackle line with tap water for 20 seconds. The carcasses were divided into groups of ten.<br>
For each run, there was a group often chickens that was sprayed with 5,000 ppm CPC and<br>
there was a group of ten chickens that was sprayed with only tap water. In the 5.<br>
typhimurium tests, there was also a group that was not sprayed after inoculation to evaluate<br>
the effect of the spray.<br>
For all of the bacteria, one group of carcasses were treated with the<br>
Johnson™ washer for 20 seconds at 60 psi with 35 cups of tap water. After the rinse, the<br>
carcasses were allowed to set for 90 seconds, and then rinsed with 20 cups of tap water for<br>
20 seconds at 80 psi. This rinse cycle was repeated either two or three times. The interval<br>
of each rinse was also 90 seconds. Another group of carcasses were treated with 5 000<br>
ppm CPC for 20 seconds at 60 psi in the Johnson™ washer, then allowed to set for 90<br>
seconds, and then rinsed with 20 cups of tap water for 20 seconds at 80 psi. This rinse<br>
cycle was repeated either two or three times.<br>
After treatment the carcasses were placed in plastic bags and 100 ml of 0.1 %<br>
buffered peptone water (BPW) was added to each bag. The bags were mechanically shaken<br>
and the rinse collected for most probable number (MPN) technique. Petrifilm™ was also<br>
employed for evaluation of total aerobic plate counts (TPC). Preexisting (not inoculated)<br>
C. jejuni was enumerated by the MPN technique and E. coli by Petrifilm™.<br>
The results presented below show that the CPC treatment is effective in<br>
reducing the number of C. jejuni, E. coli, and S. typhimurium. The wash water for the S.<br>
typhimurium runs were tested and it was found that CPC in the wash water reduced the<br>
Salmonella by 1 log. Thus, the kill data presented below for Salmonella can be reduced by<br>
1 log.<br>
Example 12<br>
Effect of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on Foodborne Fungi<br>
This study tested the effect of CPC oa foodborne fungi. Slant cultures of<br>
Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium chrysogenum were streaked onto a potato dextrose agar<br>
(PDA) plates. Thirty minutes after inoculation or 24 h after inoculation (and incubation at<br>
room temperature, two round filters (7 mm in diameter) were put on the surface of each<br>
plate, CPC solutions of 200 ppm, 1000 ppm, 5000ppm, and 25,000 ppm or distilled and<br>
deionized (DD) water were added to the filters, 10µl per filter. All plates were incubated<br>
lid side up at room temperature for 48 hours. The diameters of the inhibition rings were<br>
measure. The results presented below show that CPC is effective against foodborne fungi.<br>
Example 13<br>
Effect of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds on Chicken Carcasses using Short<br>
Application Times<br>
In two trials conducted in a commercial broiler processing facility, the Cecure™<br>
formulation (0.2 to 0.5% CPC), that is diluted from a concentrate of CPC containing CPC<br>
(40%), propylene glycol (57%) and water (3%), all component on a weight to weight<br>
basis, was used to treat post-chill chicken carcasses. In these studies, the final rinse cabinet<br>
or "fecal failure" cabinet that is positioned prior to grading and packaging, but after<br>
immersion chilling, was modified for application of the CPC formulation. Cabinet<br>
modifications included changing the nozzles to allow for only small volumes (1 to 6<br>
ounces) of the formulation per carcass, and modification of the spray pattern on the<br>
carcasses to allow for total coverage of maximum surface area. In addition, the length of<br>
the cabinet was extended and cabinet exhaust meclianiEEDS were installed The concentrated<br>
Cecure? formulation was either diluted to the correct use connection at the point of<br>
direct application to the carcass, or was diluted and held in large vessels prior to<br>
application. The dilute Cecure™ solution was applied to each carcass fox about 1.5<br>
seconds. The temperature of the solution was at ambient room temperature or slightly<br>
above or below depending on storage conditions.<br>
After carcass treatment with the dilute Cecurc™, the carcases were allowedto drip<br>
for approximately 3 minutes prior to microbiological sampling Carcasses were sampled<br>
using a whole carcass rinse technique in 400 mL of buffered peptone water. Samples were<br>
evaluates! for Campylobacter, Salmonella, non-toxic producing E coli. and aerobic plate<br>
count that estimates the total organisms. Control carcasses were also evaluated for these<br>
same organisms, but these carcasses wert collected, just prior to the modified fecal failure<br>
cabinet In boua trials, Campylobacter, E coli and aerobic (local aerobic bacteria) plate<br>
counts were significantly reduced by greater than 99%. In both trials, the incidence of<br>
Salmonella was significanty reduced to less than 10% positive while control carcass<br>
Salmonella incidence rates were in some cases greater than 60%.<br>
The foregoing description of thepreferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention was presented for illustrativc purpose and not meant to limit the invention to<br>
specific composition used in the examples because various modification to the disclosed<br>
invention are possible in light of the above teachings. The present invention isbased upon<br>
the discovery that QAC significantly prevents and reduces bacterial contamination by a<br>
broad spectrum of foodborne microbial contamination than was previously known. The<br>
concentrated QAC formulation provides many advantages for use on a large scale in a food<br>
processing plant. The invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and<br>
