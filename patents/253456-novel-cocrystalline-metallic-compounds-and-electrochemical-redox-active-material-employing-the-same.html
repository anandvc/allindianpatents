ADVANCED LITHIUM ELECTROCHEMISTRY CO., LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF TAIWAN, R.O.C., WHOSE ADDRESS IS NO. 2-1, SINGHUA RD., TAOYUAN CITY, TAOYUAN COUNTY, 330, TAIWAN, R.O.C.<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER  IN  WHICH  IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a series of metallic compounds, and more particularly to a series of cocrystalline metallic compounds which have the electrochemical redox active properties.   The present invention also relates to a process of manufacturing the series of cocrystalline metallic compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to the spatial hindrance of spinel structures or olivine structures, the ion diffusibility and the electron conductivity are not satisfactory. Recently, some literatures have been focused on the crystalline solid-state electrolytes having perovskite structures as well as the oxides, sulfides, mixed oxide/sulfide glassy-state electrolytes thereof. Although the lithium ion diffusibility of these perovskite-type materials still have space of progress comparable with common liquid organic electrolytes at room temperature, the related researches were restricted to the solid-state electrolytes and the conductivities are still insufficient.<br>
For enhancing the conductivities, the common approach includes the reduction of particle size or the addition of conductive material to lower the molecular energy level. Since the operating conditions of these methods are difficult to be controlled, the production cost is very high.<br>
Another approach of enhancing the conductivities is mixing a conductive material in the olivine type compounds. Since alkane and alkene gases are produced during the process of pyrolyzing the organic material, the<br>
2<br><br>
pyrolyzed product may cause environmental pollution and raise environmental<br>
concerns.<br>

 <br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is providing a process of manufacturing cocrystalline composite materials. The process includes steps of reacting a metal particle with a phosphate- or arsenate-containing compound to prepare a metallic compound M04.yXOy, where M is at least one selected from a group consisting of transition metals and semimetals, and 0

4<br><br>
The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.<br>
Hereinafter, a process of manufacturing such electrochemical redox active material of the present invention will be illustrated as follows.<br>
Reaction of a metal particle and a phosphate- or arsenate-containing compound Firstly, a phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution is prepared by dissolving a phosphoric acid or a dilute arsenic acid or a salt thereof in solvent. Then, at least one metallic particle (M) selected from a first-Row transition metal, a second-row transition metal, a third-row transition metal or a semimetal is added to the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution. The metallic particle is reacted with the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution to form a metallic phosphate or arsenate protective shell. This shell is also referred as a self-assembled colloidal monolayer husk.<br>
Typically, if the free acid content in the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution is too low, the metal matrix is difficult to dissolve. Whereas, if the free acid content in the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution is too high, the dissolving rate of the protective shell is increased and detrimental to shell formation. For optimizing the shell-forming ion concentration, the pH value of the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution is adjusted by adding ionic, nonionic or amphoteric surfactants. An example of the surfactant includes but is not limited to Triton X-100 (a nonionic surfactant),<br>
5<br><br>
BS-12 (Cocoal kanoy lamido propyl betaine, an amphoteric surfactant) or DNP (a cationic surfactant).<br>
Figs. 1(a) and (b) are schematic diagrams illustrating the interaction between the surfactant diffusion layer and the monolayer shell to facilitate detachment of the monolayer shell from the metal particle. Generally, the self-assembled monolayer shell 2 may hinder contact between the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution and the metallic particle 1, and thus inhibit propagation of the reaction of the metallic particle 1 with the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution. The monolayer shell 2 is electric charged or neutral. If the monolayer shell 2 is electric charged and the surfactant is ionic or amphoteric, the surfactant may be electrically attracted onto the surface of the monolayer shell 2 to form a surfactant diffusion layer 3 due to electrostatic force. Whereas, the nonionic surfactant may be adsorbed onto the surface of the monolayer shell 2 due to a Van der wal force. The interaction between the surfactant diffusion layer 3 and the monolayer shell 2 may facilitate detachment of the monolayer shell 2 from the metal particle 1, so that the metallic particle 1 is continuously reacted with the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution.<br>
The continuous reaction of the metallic particle with the phosphate-or arsenate-containing solution results in a metallic compound M04.yXOy, where M is at least one selected from a group consisting of transition metals or semimetal, and 0 
Formation of an semicrystalline nano-scale particle mixture<br>
An alkali ion A(I) and an inorganic carrier M'O are incorporated into the metallic compound M04-yXOy, where M' is at least one of any transition metal or semimetals.   The alkali metal, the metallic compound and the inorganic<br>
6<br><br>
carrier M'O are alkalinized to form an amorphous particle mixture. During alkalinization, the amorphous particle mixture is thoroughly milled to destroy the crystalline structure contained therein. As the milling time period is increased, the mixture is nano-sized. Consequently, the simultaneous alkalinization and milling may result in a semicrystalline nano-scale particle mixture M04.yXOy /A(I)/M'0.<br>
Spherical Clumping Art<br>
By centrifugation, the semicrystalline nano-scale particle mixture is clumped into multiple droplets of nano-scale particles. Each droplet of nano-scale particle includes the metallic compound M04.yXOy as a core and alkali ion A(I) with the inorganic carrier M'O as the shell. Due to the surface tension generated when the droplets fly, the droplets have a tendency to become spherical. The moisture contained in the droplet surfaces will be evaporated when contacted with the surrounding hot air. By means of the capillary attraction acting on the pores of the nano-scale particles, the moisture contained in the interior portion of the nano-scale particles will be transferred to the surface and continuously evaporated to the surroundings. By controlling the flying time and the chamber temperature, desired precursors in a spherical form are generated.<br>
Calcination<br>
The spherical precursors are then subject to a multi-stage calcining operation by circular gas-solid phase heat treatment. In the presence of controlled inert gas circularly flowing into a furnace, carbon particles and the spherical precursors are introduced.    The carbon particles and the spherical<br>
7<br><br>
precursors will be suspended in the inert gas and mixed together. The shearing stress generated between adjacent particles allows the smaller carbon particles to be filled in the pores of the precursors. In addition, the reacted gases such as moisture or a hint of carbon dioxide are exhausted by the inert gas.<br>
In the initial calcination stage of heat treatment, the precursors are subject to surface diffusion, bulk diffusion, evaporation and condensation, thereby forming a multilayered crystalline material. In the multilayered crystalline material, the core portion is substantially a crystalline compound AxM04.yXOy, and the shell portion includes a double-layer film C/M'O. Referring to Fig. 2, a schematic diagram of the multilayered crystalline material is illustrated.<br>
In the intermediate calcination stage, the constituents of the core portion of the multilayered crystalline material are slowly diffused into the crystal grain boundary and then subject to a quicker grain boundary diffusion, thereby forming an olivine crystal structure. At the same time, the double-layer film at the shell portion of the multilayered crystalline material are contracted and closely coated around the core portion.<br>
The addition of a reducing agent may reduce the valence state of the central metal of the semicrystalline nano-scale particle mixture M04.yXOy /A(I)/M'0 from 3 to 2. The overall structure thereof is substantially a neutral molecule. The matrix of the core portion is a polymeric chain including an octahedral structure and a tetrahedral structure along the ac-plane. In the octahedral structure, each central metal has a slightly distorted octahedral coordination geometry formed by six oxygen atoms. In the tetrahedral structure, the central phosphorus or arsenic atom (X) has a tetrahedral coordination geometry formed by four oxygen atoms, two of which are shared with the<br>
8<br><br>
octahedral structure. An alkali ion (A) is disposed beside the matrix to balance the valence state. In the later calcination stage, the crystal structure is gradually compacted, and the gases contained in the pores of the precursors are evolved. Accordingly, a cocrystalline metallic compound having a general formula AxM04.yXOy'M'0 is generated, as can be seen in Fig. 3.<br>
In addition, during the calcination process, the inorganic carrier M'O and the carbon particles are also crystallized on the cocrystalline metallic compound, thereby resulting in a composite material AxM04.yXOy'M'0/C of the present invention.<br>
By measuring the physical and chemical properties of the cocrystalline composite material, it is found that the addition of the inorganic carrier (M'O) maintains the crystal volume substantially unchanged but the axial length of the crystal lattice is slightly changed.<br>
When a voltage is applied on the cocrystalline composite material, the central metal is oxidized such that the matrix molecular is neutrally charged. For balancing the overall valence state, the surrounding alkali ion is released and an electron is generated. In the presence of the inert atmosphere, the central metal is reduced and a current is generated in order to stabilize the structure. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the inorganic carrier M'O and the carbon particles enhance electrochemical reversibility of the cocrystalline composite materials.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the following examples.<br>

Advantages<br>
From the above description, the electrochemical redox active materials of the present invention and their manufacturing processes are advantageous over the prior art.   For example, by adding the ionic, nonionic or<br>
14<br><br>
amphoteric surfactants, the rate of reacting metallic particle with the phosphate-or arsenate-containing solution is enhanced. As a result, the reaction temperature of the metallic particle with the phosphate- or arsenate-containing solution may be decreased from 70-80 °C (conventional method) to 20-3 5 °C. Since no organic solvent is used and no organic material is pyrolyzed to form conductive carbonaceous material, the environmental pollution is minimized. Moreover, the electrochemical redox active material of the present invention has good structural stability and excellent electrochemical reversibility.<br>
