				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable composition, a resin, and an optical component.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since plastic lenses are lighter, less fragile, and tintable, as compared with inorganic lenses, in recent years, the application of plastic lenses to optical elements such as spectacles lenses, camera lenses or the like has increased rapidly.<br>
[0003]<br>
In particular, spectacles lenses have been required to have various features including optical properties such as (1) high refractive index and (2) low dispersion property (high Abbe' s number) , and being (3) excellent in heat resistance, (4) excellent in impact resistance, (5) easily tintable, (6) excellent in working properties such as cutting properties and the like. Accordingly, various resin materials for lenses have been developed and used until now.<br>
[0004]<br>
Representative examples of those can be mentioned by polythiourethane-based resins (Patent Documents 1 and 2). <br>
[0005]<br>
l<br>
Among the polythiourethane-based resins, a<br>
polythiourethane-based resin obtained by using an isocyanate compound represented by the following Formula (1) (Patent Document 3) is used to provide a plastic lens having a high refractive index and low dispersion property, and exhibiting excellent heat resistance and impact resistance, thus it has been widely used for spectacles lenses.<br>
[0006]<br><br>
(Figure Removed) [0007]<br>
Moreover, recent spectacles lenses are often subjected to processing such as subjecting the substrate of lenses to silicon hard coat treatment or inorganic non-reflecting coat treatment, thereby increasing the added value. However, it has been known that the impact resistance of the lens is deteriorated by subjecting such coat treatments. Particularly in United States, there is a čaše where a polythiourethane-based resin lens excellent in impact resistance is also subjected to a primer coat for improving an impact resistance before being subjected to a hard coat treatment, so as to meet the standard for impact resistance defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In conseguence, further improvement of the impact resistance on the substrate has been desired (Patent Document<br>
).<br>
[0008]<br>
Further, fashionability in spectacles lenses has been required recently, thus the demand in colored lenses has increased.<br>
[0009]<br>
Herein, the tintability and the heat resistance of a substrate are usually in a trade-off relationship, and the tintability deteriorates when the heat resistance is far too high. In addition, when the heat resistance is lowered to improve the tintability, a problem ariše in that cracks form on a coat upon the application due to the dif ference in heat resistance between aforementioned hard coat or non-reflecting coat and the lens substrate.<br>
[0010]<br>
Consequently, a resin for lens exhibiting heat resistance at around 100 to 110°C, which is adeguate in practical, and having excellent tintability has been demanded.<br>
[0011]<br>
Hereinabove, a plastic lens is mentioned as an example, however, there has been demanded a polythiourethane-based resin with improved balance between optical properties, tintability, and resin strength.<br>

[0044]<br>
Among the aforementioned compounds in which X is an OH group, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and l, 4-butanediol are particularly preferable.<br>
[0045]<br>
Herein, the invention is not limited by those exemplified compounds, and these may be used alone, respectively, or as a mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
[0046]<br>
The used ratio of (A) the alicyclic isocyanate compound represented by above Formula (1) and/or by above Formula (2), (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide<br>
bond in a molecule, and the (C) the compound represented by Formula 1*3) , is such that the molar ratio of functional groups represented by NCO/(SH+OH) is usually not less than 0.5 and not more than 3.0, preferably not less than 0.5 and not more than 1.5, and particularly pref erably not less than 0. 8 and not more than 1.2. Within this range, a resin with well-balanced refractive index, impact resistance, tintability, and heat resistance can be obtained.<br>
[0047]<br>
Here, there is a concern that the curing property of the polymerizable composition deteriorates when the value of NCO/ (SH+OH) is too small. The curing property of the polymerizable composition can be further improved by making NCO/(SH+OH) to be 0.5 or larger, preferably 0.8 or larger. In this manner, mechanical properties such as resin strength, impact resistance of the resin or the like can be further improved.<br>
[0048]<br>
In addition, there is a concern that the refractive index of the resin lowers when the value of NCO/(SH+OH) is too large because the refractive index increases as the amount of SH groups in the resin increases. The refractive index of the resin can be increased by making NCO/(SH+OH) to be 3.0 or smaller, preferably 1.5 or smaller, and more preferably 1.2 or smaller. In this manner, the resin can be further preferably employed to, for example, an optical component.<br>
[0049]<br>
Further, when given that the number of moles of the hydroxy group and thiol group in the (C) the compound represented by Formula (3) are p and q, respectively, and the number of moles of a thiol<br>
group in the (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly) sulfide bond in a molecule is r, p/(p+q+r) is usually not less than 0. 001 and not more than 0.40, pref erably not less than 0. 03 and not more than 0.35, and particularly preferably not less than 0.05 and not more than 0.30. Also in this manner, a resin with well-balanced refractive index, impact resistance, tintability, and heat resistance can be obtained.<br>
[0050]<br>
Here, there is a concern that the impact resistance of the resin deteriorates when the value of p/(p+q+r) is too small because the impact resistance improves as the amount of OH groups in the resin increases. The impact resistance of the resin can be improved by making p/(p+q+r) to be 0.001 or larger, preferably 0.03 or larger, and more preferably 0.05 or larger.<br>
[0051]<br>
Meanwhile, there is a concern that the refractive index of the resin lowers when the amount of OH groups is too large with respect to that of SH groups. Lowering of the refractive index of the resin can also be controlled by making p/(p+q+r) to be 0.40 or smaller, preferably 0.35 or smaller, and more preferably 0.30 or smaller.<br>
[0052]<br>
The balance between the mechanical properties and refractive index can be further improved by making the molar ratio of the functional groups represented by NCO/ (SH+OH) to be in the above range and also by making p/(p+q+r) to be in the above range.<br>

impact resistance and tintability can be obtained, and at the same tame it results in giving sufficiently satisfied refractive index, Abbe's number, and heat resistance.<br>
[0055]<br>

These may be used alone, respectively, or as a mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
[0056]<br>
Next, processes for producing the resin of the invention will be explained.<br>
The resin of the invention can be obtained by the reaction between the above-mentioned components (A) to (C). The order of mixing the components is not particularly limited, but for example, there may be employed:<br>
(i) a process which includes first reacting the component (A) with the component (C) and then adding the component (B) thereto to carry out a polymerization; or<br>
(ii) a process which includes mixing the components (A) , (B), and (C) at once to carry out a polymerization.<br>
Herein, for the polymerization process, for example, a process yyj.u.ch includes curing by heating can be employed.<br>
[0057]<br>
When the component (C) is a compound having neither of an ether bond or a thioether bond in the molecular structure, it is preferable to employ the above-mentioned process (i) . In this manner, sudden heat generation or viscosity increase can be further controlled upon mixing the components.<br>
[0058]<br>
A resin obtained by the process (i) or (ii), as a result, exhibits excellent impact resistance and tintability and gives sufficiently satisfied refractive index, Abbe's number, and heat resistance.<br>
[0059]<br>
In addition, the resin of the invention can be obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable composition of the invention.<br>
In specif ic, the polythiourethane-based resin of the invention can be produced by blending a polymerizable composition which includes:<br>
(A)	the alicyclic isocyanate compound represented by above<br>
Formula (1) and/or by above Formula (2);<br>
(B)	at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least<br>
one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule; and<br>
(C)	at least one compound represented by Formula (3),<br>
and then carrying out a polvmerization. The polymerizable<br>
composition of the invention is cured by the polymerization. In<br>
specific, the resin can be obtained by curing the polymerizable<br>
composition of the invention by heating in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
[0060]<br>
The polythiourethane-based resin obtained in accordance with the production process of the invention exhibits a high refractive index and low dispersion property, and in particular, excellent impact resistance and tintability, and sufficient heat resistance.<br>
[0061]<br>
When curing the polymerizable composition of the invention by polvmerization, as in a known molding process, a variety of additives may be added, if necessary, which are, for example, a chain extender, a crosslinking agent, a light stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, an antioxidant, a coloring inhibitor, a bluing agent, and so on. The heating process is not particularly limited, and for example, a process of curing by heating or the like can be employed.<br>
[0062]<br>
For the purpose of adjusting a reaction rate to a desired level, it is also possible to add a suitable amount of a known reaction catalyst. As the preferred catalyst employed as a catalyst for the preparation of urethane, there may be emploved, for example, a tin compound such as dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dichloride, dimethyltin dichloride, tetramethyl diacetoxy distannoxane, tetraethyl diacetoxy distannoxane, or tetrapropyl diacetoxy distannoxane, or an amine compound such as tertiary amine. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds. The amount of catalyst added is preferably not less than 0.001 wt % and not more than l wt% with respect to the total weight amount of composition monomers. Within this range, more favored polymerizability is<br>
exhibited, and it is preferred to be within such range from the Vj.ewpoints of pot life upon blending, and transparency, optical properties, and light resistance, of the resin to be obtained.<br>
[0063]<br>
In regard to the order of adding the catalyst and the mold release agent to be used, for example, there may be employed a method of preliminarily dissolving in an isocyanate compound, a polythiol compound, a diol compound, and/or a mercapto alcohol compound, a method of adding to a mixture of an isocyanate compound and a diol compound, and/or mercapto alcohol, and a polythiol compound, or the like, but not limited by those exemplified methods and they may be added at any timing as long as the handling nature, safety, adequacy, and the like, are taken into account.  For the form of the catalyst, mold release agent, and other additives, upon addition, they may be directly added as it is, or may be prepared into a master liquid by being dissolved in some of monomers used so as to be then added.<br>
[0064]<br>
The resin of the invention can be obtained by a usual casting polymerization. To be specific, a mixed solution is preliminarily prepared bymixing various additives such as a catalyst, a UV absorber, and an internal mold release agent into monomers to be used. The mixed solution is degasified by a suitable method, if necessary, and then injected into a mold composed of 2 pieces of glass plates and tape or gasket to subject polymerization. The viscosity for the injection is not particularly limited, but the viscosity of the monomer mixed solution is preferably 20 mPa-s or larger and 1,000 mPa-s or smaller. The polymerization conditions upon polymerization<br>
are not particularly limited as the conditions significantly differ ifi accordance with types of monomers and catalyst to be used, an amount of those added, a form of mold type, and the like. However/ in the čaše of a thermal polymerization, the polymerization is carried out at a temperature equal to or higher than -20°C and equal to or lower than 200°C over l hour or longer and 100 hours or shorter.<br>
[0065]<br>
The polythiourethane-based resin of the invention mainly includes a urethane bond resulted from an isocyanate group and a hydroxy group, and a thiourethane bond resulted from an isocyanate group and a thiol group, but it may not be a problem to include any other than those such as an S-alkyl thiocarbamic acid ester bond, an allophanate bond, a urea bond, or a biuret bond, in some purposes. For example, there are many cases where further subjecting a urethane bond or an S-alkyl thiocarbamic acid ester bond to a reaction with an isocyanate group to increase the cross-linkage density gives a favorable result. In this čaše, the reaction temperature is increased up to at least 100°C and the isocyanate component is a lot used. Alternatively, some of amines or the like may be employed in combination, thereby allowing the employ of a urea bond or a biuret bond. In such a čaše of employing compounds other than polyol compounds or polythiol compounds that can react with an isocyanate compound, it is necessary to pay attention particularly to coloring.<br>
[0066]<br>
According to the invention, it is understood that the polythiourethane-based resin obtained by polymerizing a polymerization composition which includes (A) the alicyclic<br>
isocyanate compound represented by above Formula (1) and/or by above<br>
^<br>
formula (2); (B) at least one polythiol compound optionally having<br>
at least one (poly) sulfide bond in a molecule; and (C) at least one compound represented by above Formula (3), and the resin obtained by the reaction between the above-mentioned components (A) to (C) , exhibit more excellent impact resistance and tintability, and satisfied properties in ali of refractive index, Abbe's number, and heat resistance, than those of conventional resins.<br>
[0067]<br>
Accordingly, since the polythiourethane-based resin of the invention is colorless and transparent, and has excellent optical properties, the resin is ideal for use as an optical component or an optical element material such as lenses, for example, spectacles lenses and the like, prism, camera lens, optical fiber, information recording plate, filter, light-emitting diode and the like.<br>
[0068]<br>
In specific, according to the invention, a composition for giving a resin for lenses and the resin which is more excellent in impact resistance and tintability, than resins for lenses in the past, as well as satisfying ali of refractive index, Abbe's number, and heat resistance; can be obtained.<br>
[0069]<br>
In addition, according to the invention, a transparent cured resin excellent in impact resistance and tintability can be obtained for an optical material in the field where a high refractive index material is employed, and in particular, a material ideally used in the field of optical component including lenses such as spectacles<br>
lenses can be obtained. The polythiourethane-based lens of the iSivention has high refractive index and low dispersion property, is excellent in heat resistance and tintability, and further characterized in that of which the resin strength and the impact resistance are excellent, thus the lens is suitable for use as an optical component such as spectacles lenses, camera lenses and the like.<br>
[0070]<br>
The polythiourethane-based lens of the invention may have a coating layer on one side or both sides thereof, if necessary. As the coating layer, a primer layer, a hard coat layer, an antiref lection film, an antifogging coat film, an antistaining layer, a water-repellent layer, or the like, can be exemplified. These coating layers may be used alone, respectively, or a plurality of coating layers may be formed into a multi-layer to be used.  In the čaše of providing coating layers on both sides, the coating layers provided on each side may either be the same with or different from each other. For those coating layers, there may be employed in combination an UV absorber for the purpose of protecting lenses or eyes from UV light, an IR absorber for the purpose of protecting eyes from infrared rays, a light stabilizer or antioxidant for the purpose of improving the weatherability of lenses, dye or pigment for the purpose of increasing fashionability of lenses, photochromic dye or photochromic pigment, an antistatic agent, and other known additives for improving the properties of lenses, respectively. Various leveling agents for improving the coatability may also be used for the layer which to be coated by application.<br>
[0071]<br>
The primer layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose of improving the adhesiveness between the hard coat layer and lenses, and there may be a čaše where the impact resistance is also improved. For the primer layer, any material can be used as long as it provides high adhesivity to the obtained optical lens, and usually eraployed<br>
are a urethane-based resin, an epoxy-based resin, a polyester-based<br>
rt^Jia^^-^<br>
resin, a molanin—based resin, a primer composition mainly including<br>
polyvinylacetal, and the like.<br>
[0072]<br>
The hard coat layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose of giving functions such as an anti-scratching property, abrasion resistance, humidity resistance, hot-water resistance, heat resistance, and weather resistance, to the lens surface. For the hard coat layer, a hard coat composition including an organosilicon compound having curing property and at least one particulate oxide of element selected from the group consisting of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Ta, Će, La, Fe, Zn, W, Zr, In, and Ti and/or at least one particulate constituted of a composite oxide of two or more elements selected from the group consisting of those elements, are generally used.<br>
[0073]<br>
The antireflection layer is usually formed on the above hard coat layer, if necessary. There are an inorganic type and an organic type for the antiref lection layer, and the inorganic type is provided by the use of inorganic oxide such as Si02 and Ti02 in accordance with the dry method such as a vacuum evaporation technigue, a sputtering method, an ion plating method, an ion beam assist method, a CVD method<br>
or the like. The organic type is provided by the use of a composition wnich includes an organosilicon compound and a silica particle having internal cavity, in accordance with the wet method.<br>
[0074]<br>
If necessary, an antifogging coat film, an anti-staining layer, and a water-repellent layer may be further formed on the antireflection layer. As the means for forming the antifogging coat film, the anti-staining layer, and the water-repellent layer, methods and materials for the treatment thereof, or the like are not particularly limited as long as it is within the scope of not adversely affecting the antireflection properties, and there may be employed a generally known antifogging coat treatment method, anti-staining treatment method, water-repellent treatment method, and materials.<br>
[0075]<br>
In addition, the obtained polythiourethane-based lens may be tinted for a use with a dye appropriate for the purpose so as to provide a fashionability or a photochromic property. Tinting of lens can be carried out in accordance with a generally known tinting method, and is carried out generally by the following methods: (1) a method of immersing a lens in a tinting liquid, (2) a method of subjecting coating with the use of a coating agent containing a dye, or providing a tintable coating layer and tinting the provided coating layer, (3) a method of polymerizing monomer raw materials in which tintable materials are contained, (4) a method of heating a sublimation dye to allow sublimation, and the like.<br>
[0076]<br>
The method (1) is a method including immersing a lens material<br>
finished on a predetermined optical surface in a tinting liquid in which the dye to be used is dissolved or uniformly dispersed (tinting process), and solidifying the dye by heating the lens (annealing process after tinting), if necessary. There are no particular limitations on the dye used in the tinting process as long as a generally known dye us used, but an oil-soluble dye or a disperse dye is usually used. The solvent used in the tinting process is not particularly limited as long as it is the solvent in which the dye to be used can be dissolved or uniformly dispersed therein.  In the tinting process, a surfactant for dispersing the dye in a tinting liquid or a carrier which encourages tinting may also be employed, if necessary.<br>
[0077]<br>
The method (2) is not for directly tinting a plastic lens material, and it is the method either including a process of coating a plastic lens with an organic coating liquid in which a dye is dispersed or dissolved and subjecting to a curing treatment to form a tinted coating layer on a lens surface, or a process of forming a tintable coating layer on a plastic lens surface, immersing the plastic lens in a tinting liquid, and subjecting to heating to be tinted. The method (2) is a method including a process of immersing a plastic lens in a tinting liquid and subjecting to heating to be tinted.<br>
[0078]<br>
The method (3) is a method including preliminarily dissolving a dye in monomer raw materials for a plastic lens and thereafter carrying out a polvmerization. The dye to be used is not particularly<br>
limited as long as it can be uniformly dissolved or dispersed to the xtent of not deteriorating the optical properties, in monomer raw materials.<br>
[0079]<br>
As the method (4), there may be employed:<br>
(i) a method which includes sublimating a solid sublimation dye and tinting a plastic lens;<br>
(ii) a method which includes facing a plastic lens to a substrate to which a solution containing a sublimation dye is applied in a non-contacting manner, and heating the substrate and the lens to allow tinting; or<br>
(iii) a method which includes transferring a transfer layer composed of a colored layer containing a sublimation dye and an adhesive layer to a plastic lens, and thereafter heating to allow tinting. Optical lenses of the invention may be tinted in accordance with any of those methods. The dye to be used is not particularly limited as long as it is a dye having a sublimating property.<br>
