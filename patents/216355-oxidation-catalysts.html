				<td>OXIDATION CATALYSTS<br>
The present invention relates to oxidation catalysts usable in particular<br>
for the full oxidation to CO2 and H2O of volatile organic compounds (VOC)<br>
and in the processes in which said catalysts are used.<br>
A characteristic of the catalysts is the oxidation of VOC compounds<br>
with the selective formation of carbon dioxide only. This is an evident<br>
advantage with respect to the known types of oxidation catalyst, in which<br>
the combustion of the VOC compounds is accompanied by the formation<br>
of CO, which besides being a toxic component implies and energy loss<br>
when the combustion of the VOC compounds is used to generate energy.<br>
The known types of oxidation catalyst used for the combustion of VOC<br>
compounds are essentially of two types:<br>
a) catalysts based on noble metals: they are characterized by high<br>
activity even at relatively low temperatures (250- 450°C), but their cost<br>
is very high and is rising considerably owing to the scarcity of the<br>
metals and to their increasing demand, entailing problems in using<br>
them for applications such as the combustion of VOC compounds;<br>
b) catalysts based on mixed oxides, such as copper chromites and<br>
barium hexaluminates, which are far less active than catalysts<br>
containing noble metals and require very drastic operating conditions;<br>
and catalysts based on rare earth complex oxides, alkaline-earth<br>
metals and transition metals (disclosed in US 5,242,881) or having the<br>
formula La (1-x) Srx CrO3, the latter being also used to treat the<br>
emissions of internal-combustion engines (US 5,286,698) having the<br>
formula Ba2Cu3O6, which are selective in the oxidation of VOC<br>
compounds toward the formation of carbon dioxide, but are highly<br>
reactive toward CO2 and therefore tend to passivate irreversibly;<br>
or catalysts comprising oxides of Mn, Cu and La, in amount by weight<br>
expressed as metal of 40-60% Mn.12-16% Cu and 1-25% La (US<br>
5,260,248), which are only stable upto 700°C and it reduces the<br>
percentage of carbon monoxide but does not eliminate CO.<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention comprise mixed<br>
oxides<br>
of Cu, Mn and rare-earth metals, in which the metals can assume multi-<br>
valence states, having a composition by weight expressed as the oxides that<br>
are specified hereafter: 10 to 75% as MnO, 8 to 50% as CuO, and 2 to 15%<br>
as La2O3 and/or as oxides of the other rare-earth metals at the lowest valence<br>
state.<br>
Preferably, the composition is 50-60% MnO, 35-40% CuO, 10-12%<br>
La2O3.<br>
The mixed oxides that form the active components of the catalyst have<br>
the characteristic of being p-type semiconductors (in these semiconductors,<br>
conductivity increases exponentially with the temperature according to an<br>
Arrhenius-type law and the charge vectors are electron vacancies). In these<br>
oxides, the gaseous oxygen is chemisorbed onto the surface and participates<br>
in the oxidation reaction together with the lattice oxygen.<br>
The oxides are supported on porous inorganic carriers such as alumina,<br>
silica, silica-alumina, titanium dioxide, magnesium oxide. Gamma alumina,<br>
in the form of microspheroidal particles with an average diameter of 30-80<br>
microns, is the preferred carrier for using the catalysts in fluid-bed reactions.<br>
For fixed-bed reactions, preference is given to the use of carriers having a<br>
definite geometric shape, such as three-lobed cylindrical granules with<br>
mutually equidistant through bores at the lobes. The dimensions of the<br>
granules are generally from 3 to 10 mm in height, the diameter of their<br>
circumscribed circumference is 5 to 10 mm, and the ratio between the<br>
geometric area and the volume of the solid part of the granule is greater than<br>
1.3 mm-1. The oxides are supported in an amount of generally 5 to 60% by<br>
weight, preferably 20-30% by weight.<br>
The catalyst in tablets is prepared by impregnating the carrier initially<br>
with a solution of a salt of lanthanum or cerium or of another rare-earth<br>
metal, drying the carrier and then calcining it at a temperature around<br>
600°C. The carrier is then impregnated with a solution of a salt of copper<br>
and manganese, subsequently drying at 120-200 °C and calcining up to<br>
450°C.<br>
Any soluble salt can be used.<br>
Examples of salts are nitrates, formates and acetates. Lanthanum is used<br>
preferably as lanthanum nitrate La(NO3)3; copper and manganese are<br>
preferably used as nitrates, respectively Cu(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)3. The<br>
preferred impregnation method is dry impregnation, using an amount of<br>
solution equal to, or smaller than, the volume of the pores of the carrier.<br>
As already noted, the catalysts selectively oxidize the VOC compounds<br>
to carbon dioxide: this occurs even when working for a limited time with an<br>
oxygen deficit with respect to the stoichiometric value required by the<br>
oxidation reaction.<br>
With respect to catalysts based on noble metals, the catalysts according<br>
to the invention are characterized by greater resistance to sintering.<br>
For example, after treatment at 1000 °C in dry air, while the complete<br>
conversion temperature rises slightly for the catalysts according to the<br>
invention, it rises considerably for catalysts based on noble metals, owing to<br>
the remelting of the surface area caused by sintering of the metal particles<br>
that are present on the carrier. The catalysts are preferably used in the<br>
treatment of gaseous effluents from plants such as plants for the production<br>
of organic compounds, tire manufacture, asphalt blowing, wastewater<br>
treatment, and offset printing. The catalysts can also be used in the<br>
oxidation of NO and NO2. Another application of particular interest is the<br>
purification of gases from reactors for solid-state polycondensation of<br>
aromatic polyester resins (the impurities are mainly constituted by ethylene<br>
glycol), in which the catalysts are capable of completely oxidizing the<br>
impurities, with exclusive formation of carbon dioxide even when using the<br>
stoichiometric quantity of oxygen relative to the methane equivalents of the<br>
impurities that are present. In tests conducted by continuously feeding a<br>
nitrogen stream containing 1600 ppm of ethylene glycol on a fixed bed of<br>
the catalyst having the composition given in example 1, it was found that<br>
the ethylene glycol is removed quantitatively by using the stoichiometric<br>
amount of oxygen (5/2 moles per mole of glycol) working at 310 °C and<br>
with a space velocity of 10000 h-1. Selectivity to CO2 is complete.<br>
Another application of the catalysts is the catalytic combustion of<br>
methane in thermal power stations for generating electricity. In this<br>
application, the catalysts have the advantage, with respect to combustion<br>
with a catalyst of a known type, that they can operate at lower temperatures,<br>
at which NO is not generated: this allows to avoid the post-treatments for<br>
removal of this oxide that are instead required with known types of catalyst.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate but not to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A catalyst supported on gamma alumina is prepared in which the mixed<br>
oxides have the following composition, expressed as a percentage by weight<br>
of the oxides listed below:<br>
La2O3 = 9.3<br>
MnO = 53.2<br>
CuO = 37.5<br>
The preparation is performed by first impregnating with an aqueous<br>
solution of lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3) a gamma alumina carrier which is<br>
then dried at 110 °C and calcined at 600 °C. Then the carrier is impregnated<br>
with an aqueous solution of manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)3) and copper<br>
nitrate (Cu(NO3)2). This is followed by drying at 120-200 °C and calcining<br>
at 450 °C. The carrier is impregnated by using an amount of solution equal<br>
to 100% of the volume of the pores of the carrier. The amount of supported<br>
oxides is 24.8% by weight. Gamma alumina tablets were used which were<br>
shaped like granules having a three-lobed cross-section with mutually<br>
equidistant through bores at the lobes, said bores being parallel to the axis<br>
of the lobes. The dimensions of the tablets were: height 4 mm, diameter of<br>
external circumference 4 mm, bore diameter 2 mm, and wall thickness 1<br>
mm.<br>
The ratio between the geometric area and the volume of the solid space<br>
occupied by the tablets was 2.5 mm-1.<br>
The tablets were prepared by compression molding. The surface area<br>
(BET) of the catalyst thus obtained was 98.8 m2/g; porosity (by nitrogen)<br>
was 0.37 cm3/g; apparent density 0.72 g/cm3.<br>
Powdered gamma alumina, in the form of microspheres having an<br>
average diameter between 100 and 600 microns, was also used.<br>
The surface area (BET) of the catalyst supported on the microspheroidal<br>
alumina was 110.6 m2/g; porosity was 0.40 cm3/g.<br>
The following tests were conducted mainly in a micropilot plant suitable<br>
to test the combustion of gaseous hydrocarbons at the concentration of<br>
several hundred parts per million.<br>
Combustion of n-hexane<br>
Normal-hexane was chosen initially among the most significant reagents<br>
to verify the oxidation capabilities of the catalyst for two main reasons:<br>
1) it is a long-chain linear alkane which is particularly resistant to oxidation;<br>
2) it is a solvent which is widely used in various kinds of industry, including<br>
for example chemical industry and printing industry.<br>
The intended reaction is:<br>
C6H14 + 9.5 O2 =&gt; 6 CO2 + 7 H2O.<br>
The first results were obtained with a powdered catalyst and the main<br>
evaluation parameters considered were the light-off activity of the catalyst,<br>
i.e., the temperature of the gas stream at which the catalyst burns 50% of the<br>
hydrocarbons that are present, and the combustion temperature for 95%<br>
conversion. All tests were conducted at the space velocity of 20000 h-1,<br>
twice that actually used in industrial plants.<br>
The following results were obtained.<br>
Pilot-scale tests using the catalyst prepared in adequately ground and<br>
screened tablets were conducted under conditions more similar to industrial<br>
testing, with the following results:<br>
A duration test (total time exceeding 1600 hours) was conducted in<br>
conditions closely resembling the conditions of an industrial plant, again by<br>
using the catalyst prepared in tablets subsequently ground and screened and<br>
by working on a pilot scale. The total flow-rate was set at 200 cm3/minute in<br>
order to obtain a concentration of 320 ppm of normal-hexane in air at the<br>
space velocity of 20000 h-1. The catalyst was initially tested for 850<br>
continuous hours at the temperature of 380 °C, with a gas space velocity of<br>
20000 h-1 and with a concentration of 300 ppm of normal-hexane in air.<br>
Conversion and selectivity values remained at 100% throughout.<br>
In order to check for possible losses in activity of the catalyst at lower<br>
temperatures, a light-off test was performed weekly during the duration test.<br>
The catalyst was cooled down, in the gas stream itself, to 250 °C and then<br>
heated again to the ordinary operating temperature of 380 °C. The results<br>
always remained stable during the test and showed a slight hysteresis, with<br>
light-off temperatures at 255 °C and 270 °C, respectively in the cooling step<br>
and in the heating step. After five weeks in stationary conditions, the<br>
temperature of the test was first raised to 400 °C for 18 hours and then to<br>
420 °C for 72 hours, at the same flow-rate and concentration conditions; the<br>
activity of the catalyst did not change in any way even after restoring the<br>
original temperature. It was subsequently found that even an operating<br>
temperature of 450 °C causes no variation of any kind in the activity of the<br>
catalyst. After 950 hours of operation, the space velocity of the gas of the<br>
catalyst was doubled to 40000 h-1 and the oxygen concentration was<br>
decreased to 10% by volume for 18 hours. Conversion and selectivity values<br>
both remained throughout at 100% at 380 °C. After this, the catalyst was<br>
subjected to a gradual reduction of oxygen from 20% to 0% by volume at a<br>
constant total flow-rate, in order to determine the lower threshold<br>
temperature at which partial combustion products are generated. It has been<br>
found that until the value of oxygen remained equal to the stoichiometric<br>
quantity required for the combustion of normal-hexane, the conversion and<br>
selectivity values both remained at 100%. At a concentration of 3000 ppm<br>
of oxygen (88% of the stoichiometric value), conversion dropped to 85.5%<br>
and selectivity remained 100%. At approximately half the stoichiometric<br>
value of the oxygen, conversion was reduced to 58% and selectivity again<br>
remained close to 100%, with the presence of traces of ethylene and<br>
hydrogen as products of a dehydrogenation reaction. Finally, the gas<br>
mixture containing 360 ppm of normal-hexane in helium and in the absence<br>
of oxygen was fed over the catalyst for 30 minutes, keeping unchanged all<br>
the other conditions of the reaction. Conversion of the normal-hexane<br>
remained at 11% by reaction both with the lattice oxygen of the structure of<br>
the solid and with traces of oxygen (approximately 20 ppm) present in the<br>
gas stream. The dehydrogenation reaction occurs partially, but neither<br>
cracking nor formation of partial oxidation products were observed. It is<br>
noted that the presence of carbon monoxide was not detected in any<br>
condition of the catalytic test both using a gas chromatograph and with an<br>
infrared analyzer.<br>
The duration test conducted with the molecule of normal-hexane lasted<br>
over 1600 hours without noting any decay in activity.<br>
Combustion of phthalates<br>
The exhaust gas of a PVC coating machine was used as sample gas for<br>
the combustion in air of the pollutants, using the tableted catalyst on an<br>
industrial plant. The polluting gases were identified as acetic acid,<br>
propanoic acid, valeric acid and caproic acid (350 mg/Nm3), diisohexyl<br>
phthalate (300 mg/Nm3), and isopropyl phthalate (300 mg/Nm3). The total<br>
flow-rate of the gases was set to 50 Nm3/h and the space velocity was set to<br>
25000 h-1. The test lasted 4 weeks at an average temperature of 380 °C.<br>
The results can be summarized as follows:<br>
beginning of test:<br>
83.5% conversion; 100% CO2 selectivity<br>
end of test:<br>
87.0% conversion; 78% CO2 selectivity<br>
Combustion of propane<br>
In order to perform comparative tests with commercial catalysts based on<br>
noble metals, the tableted catalyst was subjected to a test for the combustion<br>
of propane (a fundamental component of LPG mixtures) on a micropilot<br>
plant.<br>
The intended reaction is as follows:<br>
C3H8 + 5O2 ==&gt; 3CO2 + 4H2O<br>
Propane concentration was set to 1400 ppm and oxygen concentration<br>
was set to 4.2% by volume at a space velocity of 20000 h-1. The light-off<br>
value was reached at 377 °C, while total conversion was achieved at 465 °C.<br>
Selectivity always remained at 100%. This performance is comparable to,<br>
and in some cases better than, the commercial catalysts based on noble<br>
metals that were considered.<br>
Combustion of ethvlene glvcol<br>
In the process for upgrading polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the gases<br>
at the outlet of the reactor are passed over a catalytic bed based on a Pt<br>
and/or Pd catalyst in order to eliminate organic impurities, mainly ethylene<br>
glycol, converting them to CO2 and H2O.<br>
It has been found that the catalyst of the present invention is capable of<br>
removing the ethylene glycol (1600 ppm) by using the stoichiometric<br>
quantity of oxygen, working continuously at 310 °C and with a space<br>
velocity of 10000 h-1. The oxidation products were formed exclusively of<br>
CO2 and H2O.<br>
Combustion of methanol<br>
An example of application of catalytic combustion for the removal of<br>
impurities of gaseous effluents of chemical plants relates to plants for the<br>
production of formaldehyde from methanol.<br>
A typical composition of waste gases is as follows:<br>
dimethyl ether 2300 ppmv<br>
formaldehyde 200 ppmv<br>
methanol 700 ppmv<br>
carbon monoxide 1.6% vol<br>
water 3.2% vol<br>
oxygen 6.5% vol<br>
Space velocity is approximately 10000 h-1.<br>
The temperature for introduction in the combustion reactor is kept at<br>
approximately 260-270 °C, and the intense exothermic behavior of the<br>
various oxidation reactions is capable of creating thermal gradients on the<br>
catalytic bed in excess of 200 °C. Tests at the space velocity of 20000 h-1<br>
were conducted in the micropilot plant with an amount of oxygen which was<br>
considerably lower (1.15% v/v) than the one used industrially and with a<br>
1.8% concentration by volume of carbon monoxide and 730 ppmv of<br>
methanol. It was found that in these combustion conditions, a temperature of<br>
250 °C of the gas stream entering the bed is sufficient to ensure 100% yield<br>
in the combustion of the reagents that are present.<br>
