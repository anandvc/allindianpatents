				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention in general relates to the field of Multi Functional Peripherals and particularly to a method of introducing server in Fax Machines. This invention further relates to a system and method of networking in fax machines. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for fax routing using fax machine server.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The United States Patent bearing number 6,765,999 entitled “Private branch exchange system” is incorporated herein to understand the state of the present art.<br>
The said patent describes a private branch exchange has a terminating classification table for storing, in connection with terminating information transmitted through an outside line circuit, destining extension numbers and additional parameters by relating them to each other and a control unit for controlling the above components. When a call terminates at the outside line circuit, the control unit picks up a destining extension number corresponding to terminating information from the terminating classification table, delivers a terminating signal from a corresponding extension line circuit and also delivers a corresponding additional parameter in the form of an additional parameter signal from the inside line circuit.<br>
However in the existing system, the server needs network support for the remote<br><br>
access of FAX Machines. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a method and system wherein a FAX Machine acts as a server which is connected to a PBX Private Branch. PBX has various FAX machines connected at various Extensions.<br>
Private branch exchange is the private telephone network used within an enterprise. Users of the PBX shares a certain number of outside lines for making telephone calls external to the PBX. Most medium-sized and larger companies use a PBX because it is much less expensive than connecting an external telephone line to every telephone in the organization. In addition, itfs easier to call someone within a PBX because the number you need to dial is typically just 3 or 4 digits.<br>
All fax calls are routed to this Server FAX Machine. The Fax Machine which acts as a server will have the extension and details of all the other FAX machines that are connected to the PBX. The Details of a FAX machine might be the DPI it supports or the Printing whether it’s a Monochrome or color printer.<br>
The Server FAX Machine receives the FAX call and during HANDSHAKING or Capability Exchange (Phase B) the Server FAX Machine finds the matching FAX machine from the table it maintains and Forwards the call to the extension through the PBX.<br>
Also any FAX to be sent out from a PC can be sent to this Server FAX Machine<br><br>
and it can send it through the appropriate FAX Machine. In Such Case the PC will also be connected to the PBX.<br>
From the FAX Machine Server fax calls can be initiated and the details of the FAX Machine connected at the other end can be updated in the server. The Details can be captured during Capability Exchange or using the NSF Data. The proposed invention eliminates the need of network Support for remote access of FAX Machines.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of routing fax using a fax machine server, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	establishing a call between a calling and receiving device in a call set up phase;<br>
(b)	identifying and selecting data encoding and processing capabilities in a pre-message phase;<br>
(c)	performing transferring, data synchronization and doing error detection and correction, and line supervision in a message transmission phase;<br>
(d)	signaling the end of the message and confirming the message in a post message phase; and<br>
(e)	terminating the call in a call release phase.<br>
In a pre-message phase the fax machines attempt to find the set of capabilities that enable them to transfer a document. The called fax machine transmits the DIS (Digital Identification Signal) describing its capabilities to the calling Fax<br><br>
machine and the calling fax machine then determines the common denominator for both the machines and responds with a DCS to inform the called fax machine of the selected settings. The settings include Data Rate, Image Resolution, Image Encoding, Page Size capabilities, Error Correction mode. Once DCS is received by the FAX server, the server puts the line on hold using, hold-off signals, RNR/RR and TNR/TR, to enable the receiver or transmitter time to carry out processing involving in calculating security values or to obtain keys from storage or, in the case of registration, from an operator. The receiving Fax Server checks the availability of Fax machine at pre-defined extensions and then initiates a FAX call accordingly for the current reception of the fax. With the help of PBX the server redirects the held call to the Fax Machine, and the Fax machines receives the Fax. If the fax machines at the extensions changed their properties the same can be updated in the PSTN Fax Server automatically by making a property table update feature in PSTN FAX Server.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system for routing fax using a fax machine server, the system comprising:<br>
(a)	means for routing all fax calls to a Server FAX Machine;<br>
(b)	means for storing the extension and detailed table of all the other FAX machines that are connected to a PBX in the said server fax machine;<br>
(c)	means for receiving a FAX call by the said server fax machine; and<br>
(d)	means for finding the matching FAX machine from the table maintained by the server and forwarding the call to the extension through the PBX during handshaking or Capability Exchange of the Server FAX Machine.<br><br>
The PSTN FAX Server updates the capabilities table that it maintains for all extensions. PSTN Fax server gets the Fax machine capabilities by initiating the fax session and the Fax machine responds its maximum capabilities through Digital Command Signal (DCS).<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

Figure 2 depicts a Calling Processing of T.30 Fax protocol of an PSTN Fax<br>
Server.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example scenario of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 sows the Calling Sequence of T.30 Fax protocol:<br>
This shows the Call sequence involved in a T.30 Fax protocol and the phases in it.<br>
Figure 2 shows the Calling Processing of T.30 Fax protocol of an PSTN Fax Server.<br>
This shows the Call sequence involved in a T.30 Fax protocol of a proposed PSTN Fax Server where it hold off after the DCS is received. Then it looks in its Lookup table as which local Fax machine meets the received DCS specification and through PBX transfers the Fax call to the Local Fax Machine. In figure the Called Terminal is changed after the Hold Off signals, this signifies the process explained above. The same is explained in detail hereunder.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example scenario of the present invention. A PSTN FAX Server is a fax machine with additional capabilities. It stores a list of FAX machines connected in the local network maintained by the PBX (Private Branch exchange). A list of extensions say from 0000, 0009 is assigned to Fax machines. Then the PSTN FAX Server can initiate fax calls on by one to all extensions in range and update the capabilities table that it maintains for all those<br><br>
extensions. Such a capability table will have space to save setting options such as,<br>
1)	Data Rate,<br>
2)	Image Resolution,<br>
3)	Image Encoding,<br>
4)	Page Size capabilities,<br>
5)	Error Correction mode.<br>
PSTN Fax server can get the Fax machine capabilities by initiating the fax session and complete till phase B of Fax call where in the called Fax machine will respond its maximum capabilities through DCS (Digital Command Signal). Also it has the status of the Fax Machine as whether its currently in USE (receiving any fax).<br>
As per ITU standard T.30 Fax has the following sessions involved in the fax transmission.<br>
A)	a call set up phase that includes establishing a call between a calling and receiving device;<br>
B)	a pre-message phase that includes identifying and selecting data encoding and processing capabilities;<br>
C)	a message transmission phase that includes transferring data synchronization error detection and correction, and line supervision;<br>
D)	a post message phase that includes signaling the end of the message and confirming the message; and<br>
E)	a call release phase that includes terminating the call.<br><br>
During Phase B, the fax machines attempt to find the set of capabilities that enable them to transfer a document. The called fax transmits the DIS (Digital Identification Signal) describing its capabilities to the calling FAX. The calling fax then determines the common denominator for both the machines and responds with a DCS (Digital Command Signal) to inform the called fax of the selected settings. These settings include, Data Rate, Image Resolution, Image Encoding, Page Size capabilities, Error Correction mode<br>
So once DCS is received by the FAX server, it can put the line on hold as per ITU. It uses the, hold-off signals, RNR/RR and TNR/TR, may be used at any time during phase B and phase D to enable the receiver or transmitter time to carry out any processing involving in calculating security values or to obtain keys from storage or, in the case of registration, from the operator. Then the receiving PSTN Fax Server checks the availability of Fax machine at pre-defined extensions and then initiates a FAX call accordingly for the current reception of the fax. Then with the help of PBX it redirects the held call to the Fax Machine, and the Fax machines receives the Fax. For Calling Fax Machine it appears as if the call is directly sending to PSTN Fax server, but rather the PSTN Fax Server renders to another Fax Machine which is even unaware of where the call is originated. The<br><br>
advantage of this is only one number can be given to the external but the received fax jobs can be shared by the PSTN Fax Server. Also if the fax machines at the extensions changed their properties can be updated in the PSTN Fax Server automatically by making a property table update feature in PSTN FAX Server.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
