A Process for the Preparation of Bis-Benzazolvl Compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of bis-benzazolyl compounds, which are useful as optical whitening agents for natural and synthetic materials.<br>
Various methods for the preparation of such compounds are known.<br>
Thus, for example, US Patent 4.508,903 describes the preparation of 4,4'-bis.benzoxazol-, benzthiazol- and benzimidazol-2-ylstilbenes by dimerization of the corresponding p-chloromethylphenylbenzazoles. However, such methods suffer from the disadvantage that the preparation of the intermediates involves several reaction steps, subsequently rendering poor overall yields.<br>
Of particular practical interest are processes in which dicarboxylic acids or their derivatives are reacted with bifunctional aromatic compounds to form the heterocyclic rings in a single reaction step.<br>
Thus, for example, European Patent 31,296 discloses a process for the preparation of benzoxazolyl and benzimidazolyl compounds by condensation of organic carboxylic acids with o-aminophenols and o-phenylene diamines in a solvent mixture consisting of diphenyl ether and diphenyl in the presence of acidic catalysts. Furthermore, British Patent 1,201,287 describes the preparation of 2,5-bisbenzoxazol-2-yl thiophenes by condensation of thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid with o-aminophenols in. for example, refluxing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in the presence of boric acid. Such processes are disadvantageous since they demand extremely high reaction temperatures, resulting in the connation of impurities which are difficult to remove from the final products and, as a consequence, loss of product yields. Furthermore, such high-boiling solvents are also difficult to remove from the reaction products and may further result in crust*formation inside reaction vessels, thus impeding work-up of the final products. Additionally, employment of chlorinated aromatic solvents in the present day is undesirable for ecological reasons.<br>
Surprisingly, a new, advantageous process for the preparation of bis*benzazolyl compounds has now been found, which provides these compounds in high yields of excellent purity under reaction conditions well suited to commercial processes.<br><br><br><br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula (1) in which<br>
Y represents -0-, -S- or -N(R2)-,<br>
R2 being hydrogen or Ci-C4alkyl;<br>
Z is as defined previously and<br>
Ri represents hydrogen or Ci-C4alkyl and, more especially for compounds of formula (1) in<br>
which<br>
Z represents a 2,5-furanyl or a 2,5-thiophenyl residue and also for those in which<br>
Z represents a 4,4'*stilbene or a 1,2-ethylenyl residue.<br>
As reaction medium for the process of the invention N-methylpyrrolidone or N,N-dimethyl-acetamide or mixtures thereof are most preferred. It is also possible to use N-methylpyrrolidone or N,N-dimethylacetamide or mixtures thereof together with a further high boiling inert solvent, e. g. toluene or xylene. The use of N-methylpyrrolidone is especially preferred.<br>
The acidic catalyst employed in the process of the invention may be selected from the group consisting of boric add, phosphoric acid, titanium Ci-C40rthoesters or tin derivatives, boric acid or a titanium Ci-C4orthoester, especially tetrapropyi or tetrabutyl ester, being of preference. The amount of catalyst employed may vary over wide ranges and is dependent on the chemical entity. Thus, for example, amounts varying from 0.01 to 50moie%, based on the amount of compound (2), preferably 0.1 to 30mole% may be used.<br>
Reaction of compounds of the formulae (2) and (3) may be carried out within a wide temperature range, but is preferably within the range of between 100 and 250°C, in particular within a temperature range of between 150 and 200’C.<br>
The presence of a secondary solvent is of particular importance when the compound of formula (3) is in the form of a monoester or, especially, the free dicarboxylic acid. In these cases, water formed during the course of the reaction may be continuously removed from the reaction mixture. Examples of suitable solvents, without the choice being limited thereto, are selected from the group consisting of toluene, the xylenes and isomeric mixtures thereof and pyridine, toluene and xylene being especially effective.<br><br>
The reaction of the invention is normally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, under certain circumstances, it may prove advantageous to perform the reaction under higher or lower pressures.<br>
Within the scope of the compounds of formulae (1) and (2), when Ri represents halogen this may be fluorine, bromine, iodine or, especially, chlorine.<br>
  groups Ri and/or Ra may be branched or unbranched such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, 2-ethylbutyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, 1-methylpentyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylhexyl, n-heptyl, isoheptyl, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl, 1-methylheptyl. 3-methylheptyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 1,1,3-trimethylhexyl, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylpentyl, n-nonyl or n-decyl, d-Cydoalkyl esters of compound of formula (3) are substituted con’esponding ly.<br>
alkoxy groups Ri may be branched or unbranched such as methoxy. ethoxy. n-propoxy, Isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, isobutoxy, t-butoxy, 2'ethylbutoxy, n-pentoxy, isopentoxy, 1-methylpentoxy, 1,3-dimethylbutoxy, n-hexoxy, 1-methylhexoxy, n-heptoxy, isoheptoxy, 1,1.3,3-tetramethylbutoxy, 1-methylheptoxy, 3-methylheptoxy, n-acetoxy, 2'ethylhexoxy, 1,1,3-trimethylhexoxy, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylpentoxy, n-monody or n-decoy.<br>
Aralkyl groups R2 may be benzyl or phenethyl which may be substituted by halogen,  -CIO alkyl or d-Dialkoxy groups or, preferably, unsubstituted.<br>
The alkaline or alkaline earth metal M may be selected from the group consisting of K. Na. Ca or Mg, but is preferably K or Na.<br>
